0,2020-06-27," Good luck finding equipment online store, Multiple data sources supports reopening much larger cause protests. 

 Hey, brother! Fellow Buckeye here. I‚Äôm sorry hear depression/anxiety. alone :)

As situation, I‚Äôve following COVID-19 closely lens scientific community U.S. (I studied evolutionary biology OSU - say say I‚Äôm expert specific field, level scientific literacy allows understand experts field). said, wouldn‚Äôt worried risk contracting COVID new position. Stay focused ensuring you‚Äôre washing/sanitizing hands frequently touching face, follow supervisor‚Äôs instructions take temperatures safely (I‚Äôm imagining infrared thermometer held arms length take forehead temperatures - donning proper protective equipment). long people you‚Äôre screening lingering around immediate vicinity extended periods (10-15-20 minutes), small enough risk contracting COVID getting seriously ill it‚Äôs irrational worry it. face plenty small risks every day humans. another small one, like driving work getting airplane.

Stay diligently safe, afraid :) That‚Äôs United Dr. Dao incident killed pets airline combined.

AA airline CEO said ‚ÄúWe never lose money again‚Äù disgruntled mechanic try murder planeload people. SF masks alive well. Proud Bay Area. though. know average person thinks strong lol. Fyi, really strong best ventilators. Nobody makes better ventilators do, believe me. Everybody‚Äôs lining order ventilators. know usefulness masks. Everyone China forced wear them. article linked said downplayed efficacy masks.

My point counter productive lie people make want regardless intentions. That‚Äôs lose credibility.

How trust next advice won‚Äôt ulterior motives behind detriment family? birthday weeks too! lucky live area cases relatively control, people still stupid matter go. Hoping safely celebrate it. Dubya set example 9/11 people followed suit. People today still following example set leadership currently have, difference type example set (selfishness, hate, fear, victimhood, etc). Fleeting encounters multiple people retail store (or marching street outdoors) different sitting crowd longer period in, say, bar, church, political rally. Upvoted since question worth asking.

Apparently people wear masks **or** social distance well [Myrtle beaches, shared bathroom facilities also potential vector.

Also, protesting cops ashpyxiating someone good reason often perceived important fun. doubt they'd try shit, people saying correct, huge percentage us catch it. afford serve huge percentage population? suppose either giving huge pay-outs cover ongoing health concerns. health insurance total bullshit. know sticker doesn‚Äôt enforce anything 

Perhaps looking different word

Because enforcement isn‚Äôt damn sticker, champ I'm curious protesters somewhere 3 4 times less likely infected average person? pulled soon, information dates. that, dropped steeply, since leveled think news show people dying shit. People understand. wife ER vet sees animals die pulmonary edema/pneumonia time. started people family like ""I tough, fight it,"" basically told ""I wish could see patients die this, horrible. absolutely worst, excruciating death."" sees crazy shit imagine.... Lots dead people lots money coming ! Good ! live Maryland. Work MoCo, even red county live, everybody wears mask. 

It important mask policy. there's not, feel odd wearing nobody else is, enforced feel odd wear one, everybody else is. Psycology runs deep lot people. 

Having official mandate cuts it. Good Hogan. I'm west sussex. actually know caught child sneezed next me, Although symptoms persistent dry cough night. Within hours knew ill, woke extremes. spread lot faster think.  Fair enough Also thank you. honestly, you. can't really express properly means something. I'm cool but
...I know likely come genotype jazz. Thanks. Honestly. We've done outdoor social distancing socialization neighbors, that's husband. met friend park late March dogs could play together. last time met friend.

We've allowed kids one friend (and house). kid, they're seeing 20 kids one time. one kid three four times starting two weeks ago so, county moved phase. masks gloves use. Hand sanitizer. they're eating they're separate. they're outside take masks. know three families involved isolating, individually family safe us (which knows safe, we've eliminated lot lives). One daughter's boyfriend, know happy see him, able cuddle kiss hold hands, know misses that. better facetime. 

But that's it. One friend each, masked up. Constant refrains of, ""Are girls masked?"" Things never thought I'd say. 

I miss best friend. miss sports (playing watching). family across country, miss them, normal miss. I've seen video usually do, that's kind nice. trip east year. person camps younger daughter, signed virtual summer camp couple weeks. topic excited about, we'll see goes. likes it, we'll more. Something kill time. poor kids home since March 13th. even know younger set foot store since then. friends' houses, doctors' offices, might car four times?  


I like wearing masks. one does. they're right thing. I've gotten bunch cute ones. Anything make easier nicer deal them. got dog's picture family. :) One Star Trek (blue science! red dying first, gold security. Blue science, bitches!), one NHL team. not. like baseball caps hoodies now. May well one every mood. Make fun kids, too. Make easier them. believe lockdowns keep hospitals overwhelmed. stopping virus point. Headlines always reality reason would lockdowns protect hospitals overwhelmed. unfortunate confluence events. can't realistically say protesting groups thousands ok time tell businesses keep normal volume 25% think people already questioning whole thing going think sham. That's making judgement either way, that's reality situation. gathering potential risk. Like flu, covid really care gathering.

No, care *where* gathering. Outdoor transmission shown extremely low. *indoor* gatherings problem, far know lot protesting done surrounded four walls rioting convince virus go somewhere saner, streets rioting, burning, killing. hurting people? reigns.

Clearly. Hey, absolutely. done plenty horrible stuff, love help üòÇ

I totally agree. table differently abled (I apologize current/correct phrase) adults, caretakers trip. Nobody wanted take them, thought pretty crappy, stepped up. normal table, help stuff like cutting food, big deal. rule first time restaurant would give gourmet muffin. asked lady charge first time eating there, end meal brought 20 muffins, told could breakfast. manager pissed like ""Its first time!"" lady charge hugged me, cried think gotten treated pretty badly places. still think them, really poignant moment life. 

I absolutely loved fun tables, miss good tips too. Theres something satisfying getting straight cash. also really miss messiness drama staff. It‚Äôs masks. It‚Äôs testing, contact tracing, proper quarantine anyone arriving internationally, population actually trusts listens government. 

It‚Äôs greatest thing ever. 

The stores apps 

Frys, Safeway etc Im ahead curve. said 2 months ago got reemed it. Let's real: level damage body avoid gyms next year too.

Unless really care significantly decreased performance. case I'm trouble understanding lift... Trump done best divide country. succeeded. working separate family members infected allowed virus grow within households. situation worsened people, lost jobs, started getting hungry. rich country might able social distancing. poor country entire family shares single bedroom, much. There's also world difference level organization China India. even comparable. hope since people PA seem focused death rate going rising number positive covid19 tests. support BLM going crowded beach I‚Äôve never used instacart like (just seems lazy) don‚Äôt know I‚Äôd trust online ordering grocery store, everyone smartphone internet connection (or knows effectively use do) requiring masks entry seems like fair compromise. Eh...150M seems bit extreme.

50-75 million? Possible things spiral even control. 27, female, 5‚Äô3, 130 wear safety goggles well. Covid needs massive blood transfusions, science make donors feel completely safe makes sense me. Well it‚Äôs funny Spanish Flu 1918 really American flu Never said large outbreaks southern china One german doctor made case professional swimmers losing pulmonar capacity, week article said results investigations including wuhan asymptomatic ones showing damage lungs.

I remember one user telling true german doctor corrected partners truth shit cero harmful shame, got way retirement understanding enforcement means I'm american born abroad same. Mad cow disease shit. Fucking prions Tax fucking churches already! think people still calling ""Chinese flue "" well welcoming Covid19 culture super upsetting . 


This flue American apple pie point. pretend renowned surgeon. save lives! Brazil, USA Latin America 

Big, corrupt doesn‚Äôt speak Spanish Yeah last thing want government responsible debt-fueled company one historically unprofitable sectors there. Europe tips included bill generally add also personally tip.  Yep pretty spot Illinois great 

False 1000 different levels. Thanks alot Joe rogan Grandparents not, time finite. time they're losing time also. longer goes on, suffer it. fake, Sniffles quite real. important enough people. told opposite. many people USA Corona?

How many died?

What population USA?

Thanks advance!  childhood. Yeah 7.8 billion people world, seem pretty small percentage wise. data protest testing shows 1% positivity less. tells us reopening actually feasible, masks 100% enforced. would preclude restaurants bars opening. Asian countries done seems worked. wish Slovenia right now. fact even 20% restaurants compliant miracle.

That's probably COVID procedures new. bet get vastly different numbers couple weeks extra cleaning gotten really, really old. Yeah it‚Äôs end article it‚Äôs also CDC website updated 2 days ago. think underlying conditions added increasing risk jog neighborhood see people go side street. guess nobody else gives shit nobody ever moves see me. I‚Äôm always one avoiding interaction. Used busy people sick sitting house. Don‚Äôt see many people again. guess done walking dogs back sitting bars. Way go cunt-tards. Like Dollar tree Police badge! cancelled opening week ago. What's general consensus guy? know he's industry insider think insight pretty point practical time. whataboutism strong one #No.Shit.Sherlock. I‚Äôm AB-, better off, fucked? Ugh. workplace. cant born England 90's :/ optics voiceovers politicians supporting mass gatherings. ban groups going stick interest public health, needs universal application messaging.  bad feeling many ""confirmed"". welcome I‚Äôm sure still go Brazil. Republican National Convention August. act like it‚Äôs none issue don‚Äôt close little get together Pick 

No need go inside. Close them. Keep day laborers congregating every morning Home Depot.

They home entire province BC less 3000 cases total reporting 10-20 per day. saying agree opening, rather confused granted reopening governing bodies give okay. saw friend Instagram leave LA come back home NJ galavanting around shore. can‚Äôt one. Unfortunately, right answer gets bad right thing many people stay home possible. means nobody go grocery store, pickup/delivery. would make workers safer too. seat empty not. company giving shit even trying saying screw it. much rights!! /s say average five day‚Äôs realize infectious time... That's part our, yeah bad pretty much over! legitimate concerns- article lists concerns, actual spikes.

again- numbers bear out.

And again, failed read far, apparent signs dramatic swing. De Blasio Thursday announced three-day average percentage positive tests risen slightly 2% 3%.

Hospital bed usage down. Positive tests down. 

The entire story massive surge cases TX, FL CA started spike time. cities we've arguing protests well spikes all, nevermind 5k+ per day AZ FL seeing. disingenuous try blame spikes states protests data shown case. Karen calls far left traitor doesn‚Äôt respect constitution doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs VP. people talk came sickness kicked ass week November 2019 imply covid lot cultural unique culture too. know what... maybe Mexico REALLY pay ! Especially since well understood average person think lazy... explain Ted Cruz then? people talk ass? 

 ever look Origins Song name ? Surprisingly said could eliminated air filtration. Thought would say could eliminate god‚Äôs love ^^^and ^^^some ^^^donations red team = death unemployment.

clockwork I‚Äôll tell , Orlando health coming capacity. Miami hospitals already have. Even rural panhandle getting hit now, pensacola hospitals dealing many cases Holy shit, no, that's i'm talking about. LOL Im sorry. got mild pneumonia 30s ran everyday too. never felt lungs fully came back. underlying condition situation may better. BUT, I've adapted best still work pretty hard, hard did. 

Good luck. [flip flop Confirmed. They're holding press conferencev details Monday think man's daughter speaking it. sure seem like fucking problem me, entitled prick. die Oh doctors blamed much more. blame usually comes form lawsuit Traveling much problem.. getting close people is. people able rent villa Spain.. restraint resorts Spain outside seating lots spare space. typical family holiday fine. Ibiza much. mean wash hands stay fuck away people. near people, people can't breathe face can't breathe theirs.

Public restroom tip solid one though! Shit homes ya'll! widespread change entire country takes lot time effort. There's simple long-term fix widespread policy, takes decades. Please explain believe used ‚Äúmuslim bashing opportunity‚Äù. LOL Wow, earth takeaway article? cops kill citizens hundreds every month, need protest. ""moderate"" cared injustices inequality would never happen first place.  are, 130k dead.... right! stopped believing riots happened two weeks media didn‚Äôt give shit covid. response lot may , would need heck lot contact tracers. 
Your point? saw guy wearing Trump 2020 mask PA yesterday. Hey, least mask on. mono 2011. One main symptoms painful enlarged spleen. Since spleen enlarge immune system fighting something. Sometimes know I‚Äôm getting sick days symptoms spleen hurts. 

Since I‚Äôve social distancing using masks hardy bothers me. Guess I‚Äôm catching many colds others. 

I believe spleen stays enlarged ever since become super enlarged I‚Äôm fighting something. cat scan done several year ago enlarged spleen didn‚Äôt pain time. 
You sound like describing spontaneous  it‚Äôs downvoted tattoos??? stop conjecture articles? hard numbers? many people fully recovered vs didnt? still possibility hit 1 million near end July current growth rate cases US fortnight infection death. *Free Republic Western Australia doctor tell would medication rest life? pre-eclampsia first son, hospital bed rest last 3 weeks pregnancy.

The outside part used cool mechanical parts mix indoor air. Yes. noy September? Safe drinking water.... Flint, MI entered chat. actually interesting recent controversy surrounding actual death toll Justinian Plague. article suggests impacts equivalent Black Death, despite claims similar death tolls: case, lack trust China reported. makes feel better might got anyway - managed get shingles (and cool scars chest) early 30's really happily cursing. Possibly one stress free periods life ... shingles seem notice ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø say now, guarantee things scientists reached consensus personally disagree with. we‚Äôre left obvious solution: feel sick, even look another person longer sick. Focus testing general public catch asymptomatics presymptomatics, maybe test actual potential value past telling people already presumed. It‚Äôs like people charge never even heard concept opportunity cost. finance bro learn anything perhaps others will; terms bailout specifically said AA allowed buyback shares cause squandered money last 10 years.  Mid 20s, male, fit. COVID19 March, didn‚Äôt need get hospitalized, permanent damage quite certain lifespan reduced 10 years. Don‚Äôt fcking joke around novel virus infections! careful wore surgical masks time, government purposefully didn‚Äôt test people cause panic even downplayed virus flu... result, nobody else tried safe even mocked wearing mask mostly protected others. Thanks ruining life.


After 3 month even developed antibodies, 
* still sense smell taste
* lung functions still drastically reduced (FEV1 dropped 70% isn‚Äôt recovering anymore, residual capacity increased 4 liters isn‚Äôt recovering anymore, MEFs drastically impacted)
* still dizzy, SOB
* recently developed coagulation issues. Lots bruises, petechia, micro thrombosis Combine study showing antibodies wane 2-3 months. vulnerable second infection precisely body still weakened first. 8 days go 7 8 million, 6 days go 8 9 million, 5 days go 9 10 million. predict 11 million 4.5 days off. around 12 million July 5th. also good. far protesters went get tested small amount it. yes agree Protests catalyst virus, time Protests need done system insanely screwed covid murders become ensconced public awareness. look protesters caught virus, NY instance tested positive tens thousands tested. look Conservative protesters (who barely wore masks) rates much much higher. combination social distancing masks helps, gatherings quite stupid unless properly organized, happen protests. issue protesters twofold. go protest 1-attempt social distance (almost impossible situation) 2-wear mask 3-when done protest self isolate 14+ days take test. did. went protested, self-isolated 14 days alone got tested. Negative. protests must go on, giving pressure allow Trump Administration deflect attention onto issues one MUST addressed. cede point social distancing , impossible protest situations. also say people (my friends) went protest 20+ fairly certain still self-isolation callous cold people (we 1st sunday, last week isolation testing done). dont though, go back day day irresponsible. go back May watch Merkal explaining country exactly going wait longer reopen. flat said cost far shut again. Every country followed course managing spread going lose even Bc didn‚Äôt follow science. group protested end lockdown Bc costing businesses, couldn‚Äôt seem understand would lose close again. Houston haircut protestors saying it‚Äôs fake news. It‚Äôs beyond anything I‚Äôve ever seen. Worth noting bankruptcy related mismatch assets liabilities; bankruptcy mean companies viable long run. avoidance real value proposition.

That said, prospective members feel comfortable risk tradeoff in-person, location-based providers Gold's struggle. Assuming vaccine effective treatment next 12-18 months, see return in-person experience. Trump completely failed america, especially supporters. 

They get deserve. Console peasant! /s I'm entitled opinion can't change mind. use real dinosaurs Juarassic Park. tell pixels.  Toilet paper meant break fairly quickly good choice. roll paper towels week spill? Cheap booze weather?

Do need give 3rd Yup. friend came contact someone COVID positive, needs work doesn‚Äôt end homeless. Hispanics account 14 percent population Durham County, account almost 63 percent COVID-19 cases. perfect environment virus survive, cold dry air. Many factories use face shields instead i.e n95 masks, masks equipment 'cleaned' reused exclusively one person. face shield 'cleaned' sterilized, worn amongst workers.

The safety measurements they've strictly contamination purposes regarding food-processing ideal virus first place. much cost you? We‚Äôve never, never done ‚Äúbest do‚Äù anything far year not, protests demonstrations everywhere, people wear masks outside grocery stores, kids teens packed everywhere without distancing. Novax, masks movements gaining tractions on. Well, would explain Hart‚Äôs wife‚Äôs anger clip then. Seems like shit situation around tbh man made. Wide spread scientific consensus natural virus. nothing alludes man made. Trump would bragged it. ‚ÄúWe best viruses, tremendous viruses‚Äù rather large protest Amsterdam weeks go far covid cases linked protest. busy everyone mask. Yeah you‚Äôll fine, unless one 0.0000000001% people get die

Good luck 

Everything‚Äôs gamble worldview ends 10,000 years ago, got make everything fit Agreed, thank reply! Fucking hell, ""first wave"" get hit 2nd one probably worse, interesting say least. Suspiciously impressive. stance dont like governing body telling conduct life (I still don't

Let save trouble, sound like dumb fuck. Imagine thinking alone know everything world around based laws, rules, guidelines combined efforts million people better educated smarter ever be.

You ever look mirror wonder ended retarded thinking know better everyone else planet?

haha. slowing general. probably hit 1M deaths July definitely hit eventually know body fat is?

Even caloric deficit, probably going lose appreciable muscle mass get around 6-8% long getting sufficient protein diet. pcr test false positives ‚Äì positive, CoV-2 Infection. lots false negatives ‚Äì swabbing technique might bad, virus might deteriorated transport, and, important, pharyngial swab negative virus moved organs.

Antibody tests far less false negatives, false positives, depending test.

So answer question depends reason test:

* Covid? accurate enough answer this.

* infectious? PCR answer this.

* Covid? antibody tests answer this.

* immune Covid? nobody knows yet... Hmm, Netherlands strict lockdown 60 new cases daily somewhere 0-3 deaths. 

Even strictest lockdown we've had, allowed walk outside (but discouraged go public places). Furthermore, masks required public transport. Lastly, people encouraged work home (which lot people still doing).

I think biggest gamechanger prohibition large indoor events clubs.

Our strictest lockdown entailed:


- restaurants, clubs cafes closed
- gyms, barbers schools closed
- remote work encouraged
- group formation people
- keep 1.5 distance times
- wear facemask public transport
- amount people allowed stores time limited 
- wash hands frequently
- public gatherings size.

Now, every restriction lifted except clubs festivals. Even sexworkers allowed work again. feces big deal me. unhealthy wear mask. collecting lots crap it. know masks worn medical context? touched human hands. incapable wearing mask correctly. symbol much care human beings, inside know harm good. aerosols stopped non-medical mask? think so. works like washing hands desinfectans 10 times day. kill good bacteria building resistance towards bad ones. immune system needs training fuck around real dangerous thing comes along.

 want hypocritical thus wear mask. Luckily Holland people think same. public transport mandatory wear non-medical mask, advice CDC. don‚Äôt get this. hospitals going get overwhelmed lots medical personnel going die. people it? what? Good luck getting hospital heart attack. think happened New York, Italy, Spain won‚Äôt exact thing happens there? Making excuses lot easier taking control life. think asymptomatic cool. think deserve pity comes back bite organs later on. Fun thing almost one denmark ever used mask still never got serious death tolls/cases bullshit, contact trace many people lot probably phones.

Over one billion Indians phones. need ""probably"". data available: Someone die obese? fuck mate wanted brexit, leave empire something inferior like europe. Please don‚Äôt. point make go hotspots, go work sick interact infinitely people retail job waking walking street. Please tell you‚Äôre misguided dumb voice online worries me. Dudettes disagreeing, telling check time line. Shit got lung damage pneumonia. even covid related. joke. That's quite challenge given. need hear stories. mean bats rare nobody knew infected virus existed. people US hunt eat wild animals too, UK rest world. reason see viruses crossing much ones could already have. said bunch viruses brewing factory farms across Europe candidates next human disease. One particularly worrying one African swine fever virus, spreading worldwide. Nobody talking shutting factory farms though. 

The Chinese response great start fairness caught unaware totally new pathogen. let escape borders manage control figured via pretty extreme measures. big hurdle accepting asymptomatic people contagious. remember mocking Chinese people making masks stuff home talking authoritarianism came lockdowns. 

Most countries far slow adopt US, despite fully informed resources most, massive virus reservoir make eradicating disease much difficult. Looking countries took initial warnings seriously clear China responsible massive death toll. mean imagine started US Brazil... Things would much worse now. Coz ain't supporting black people I‚Äôm RN coronavirus isolation unit.

Interesting case week, 40 y/o got covid. Didn‚Äôt respiratory issues all, presented severe colitis never issues before. Infectious disease determined logical cause colitis determined covid induced colitis. Pretty strange. 2000 cases yesterday overall maybe around 1200 dragging long despite long down. 
Need get 800 mark soon probably 250-500 July end know wear mask Even daddy government doesnt tell right?  liquor store recently one guy mask looked like photo face underneath it, including matching beard color. 
Either super-realistic random match, (I think) photo face. 
Where get one those? walk hospital shake hands docs patients. ‚ÄúThe covid panic starting die down, people wondering everything still shut down, do?‚Äù

‚ÄúIDK, make new bullshit like permanent effects lol‚Äù 

‚ÄúGenius‚Äù Nice! Sweden let planes without mask, every seat empty. obviously still great fly, certainly helps rules enforced hard Working literally gamble life line. Condolences family casino worker passed away. hard choose losing work take risk coming work knowing might get expose virus. reopening business keep safety employee top priority. RIP Adolfo First, necessary make government accountable fiasco. Next, necessary make GOP accountable pretending problem exist. talk abstract responsibility entire nation. **Lets blame masks**. basic social watched maybe 15 people congregate corner **without masks**

Or maybe... it's... both? 

This fucking rocket science. It‚Äôs outdoors people talking faces close think terrace 50 people crammed shouting other, exchanging glasses wine taste generally passing stuff on. bars really vigilant others much. Possibly I‚Äôm paranoid, it‚Äôs bit much see 20 people outside beer shop hugging kissing (greetings kisses) without masks. Nobody meter apart. 

Indoors masks places many nose chin types there. Thanks responding. wish better health Common sense? Great idea! past 5 months? 47 million? think they'll fit? What? Next time tell bikini inspector pass real aswell???!! father-in-law developed aches fever 102.9 ...He's quarantining getting screened tomorrow, question: strongly feel like Covid19 prevalent viruses right now? feel like flu pretty much snuffed US. Idk. worry everyone side family laughing thing may exposed him/exposing others public. Lives small house 1 bathroom. There's realistic way quarantine family house. Hoping stay away expose grandkids. Oh fuck sake reviewed reddit posts.

I'm sorry even wasted time replying you.

Maybe r/conservative safer space you. get MRI/CT DNA test *MAOA-L* genes (40% pop) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), scan... 

All Sociopaths psychopaths scum bags... I'm sick abused them.. time take genetic medicine finally follow rules...LMAO, 

enjoy 4th July! Can't add jobless people nursing home? need assistance cares leeches? state run betting survive! spice economic points donate mask, hydro gel... Etc let fight out.  Mentally yeah. sure physically yet. studies showing permanent damage possible.

But I'll never forget pain discomfort. it'll probably years catch simple cold without worrying again. feel ya. NEWSOM BAD Exactly. see results different approaches disease. like compare Germany USA, level development similar conditions start. on, rest almost history now... Orlando went 3 months real hard lockdown serious social distancing face masks outdoor.

Why would possible, opening early opening without retaining containment measures screws things up. 

No country world could reached level virus saturation assuming 3 months thank you, i'm wishing best That's really creative That's pretty much exact story post-viral symptoms remained. shingles mild also, still resulted severe prolonged fatigue day. hard people understand level fatigue comes virus. debilitating. simple tasks exhausting. difficult deal especially young person. Best luck you, hopefully shingles never returns. Wear mask! risk getting COVID, worth sake mild discomfort mask. dude he‚Äôs replying literally said ‚Äúno people economy‚Äù two political parties must take opposite positions literally everything. public knowledge months now? Seriously! Click get PDF detailed state report. also test positive rates every county individually. MEDIAN age people testing positive 34, half people younger that.

People rational, old people sequestering themselves. beach bars last night. packed gills, honestly see single soul older 50.

It going like New York here. isnt. first time forever! No. rising. continue to. Yakima super populated area, that's trying skew point, going rising keep rising. understand people like trying downplay something serious. Check data Monday Tuesday report weekend. 

No things changed drastically 1 week. 

Hospitalizations better adherence compliance initial shut down. idiots like happened, casting doubt bullshit disingenuous arguements..

Per capita big deal. Limited rural area. 



I agree yakima needs rethink hospital situation. Except WWE's main demo middle-aged people audience also increasingly female, one main reasons whole ""Women's Revolution"" bullshit stopped female wrestlers essentially strippers national TV started wrestle instead.

It's well-known fact internet wrestling community wrestling Americas UK struggles greatly attracting young audiences. Japanese wrestling better, hand major Japanese feds like NJPW, DDT NOAH also \*much\* women watching them. asthma concerned got it. However, lucky. didn‚Äôt affect asthma go lungs.i sick week. fight me

lmao good troll would never defend orangutan, invent fake news. gave name. Pre-fact story fabrication happening years 45 came along. spectacular stupid cunt Yep, antibodies less, evidence reinfection &lt; 6 months ""Delete account go back whatever firm hired tell failed"" 
Lmao dude ok? That's dumbest shit I've ever heard entire life. Wtf account age anything, like born 15 days ago. new accounts keep comment anything? reason said going get downvoted know site works now, share something people agree bam, thing healthy disagreement, partly comedic predict happening. That's totally fair, also totally anecdotal. point simply article sensationalized, scientifically speaking can't really speak long term consequences certainty. . . Yet. I'm sorry hear still feeling well. positive cases increases chances vulnerable people getting infected. Overall positives matter. wear masks! Otherwise Corona-chan come :( Yes, restaurants evil everyone goes one. Seeing recovery rate India reached almost 57% difference recovered cases active cases close 100k, mean India could soon free virus? also cunt would like class taught large group toddlers online? would contain? Yup. fuck essential workers, that's why. 

My company used damn mental gymnastics count ""essential."" People still getting sent home tested positive COVID-19 company decided make money instead protect employees. gotta feed kids, fuck me. Yep. friend virus although healthy now, got back taste smell. 3 months after. agree, HC workers equivalent walking burning building every day. Heroes sure. One would think would better now

The US poorly, poorly statistics show first glance. We're ten times worse everybody else besides Brazil. US continent sized. states european-country sized. recent spike fault course, then, last week May still restaurant bar restrictions, US 20,000 new cases day 950 deaths. That's 400 positive 19 dead per state, well line european numbers. Even spike we're still better Sweden Belgium did. point, file refugee status escape failed state? something visible killing you, people struggle believe it.

Even lot progress made mental illness sometimes doctors pretending believe job. 

Invisible illness even believed partners often. ex never believed me, parents never believed me, still early stages MS. told ""everyone bad days"". think easy notice something happening body normal. whole point european countries service workers dont rely tips make living Education last whole country.

*Mississippi entered chat* also need aware case numbers / R number local area, information, remember delayed incubation period (up 14 days). want see trending direction. tell risk area currently at. depends day, really. Overall, severe lack energy. Tasks easily many (basic cleaning, cooking meals) are, general, usually do. good days they're almost tease. I'm feeling well enough go pick groceries, almost certain next day write off. ""crash"" days (when symptoms severe) sleep night, wake hour around 7am, sleep day, wake around 9pm, sleep night around 10. still feel rested. fact never feel rested. Ever. Everything difficult me. actually saw yesterday relate much. Even sitting exhausting times.
Thankfully much pain. joint pain there, sometimes migraines neck pain, though likely laying long periods time rather condition itself. start doubting, doubt everything. people question dinosaur bones even real. perhaps made stan winston studios drilled rocks?

what absolute proof, mathematical proof, arent faked? proof isnt possible one asked trust 'majority opinion' turn provisional. First all, Big Boys still around? number years back pretty bad pneumonia, asthma it. shudder think damage COVID would cause, long term Nice Haha yup, sometimes spelling hard They've already issues people following guidelines Disney Springs. imagine even easier get away taking mask rides. outdoors? read, masks super important indoors, passing infected person outdoors without mask high chance result infections. 

Here Germany give fuck masks outdoors, mandatory shops. Even though wear wrong, vast majority wears right. overall numbers still ok given current restrictions. drives current clusters always indoor situations, like T√∂nnies meat factory one 1300 cases. Berlin hospital. events drive numbers contained Bola de pendejos...smh Haha yup sometimes spelling hard Every day part September never ended now. testing goes test positive rate up, means growth faster growth testing, i.e. totally handle what's happening.

Do testing data up-to-date includes week, unlike [official Wow, western hemisphere way behind. fact recovering covid19 patients permanently reduced respiratory capabilities reported Chinese doctors 3-4 months ago. Thanks saw one. However, mostly people tested positive, people long lasting symptoms like 60, 90 even 100 days like friend whose symptoms started mid March. Question - ever ethical state purposely lie population?

If health officials tried market idea wearing masks American people way protecting knew certain would save lives disseminated truth -- mostly protects people -- would right so? get Cuomo stuff couple thousand sick coronavirus patients again? Spice numbers bit? üòë Good know may permanently effected covid. Everyone outside protesting still idiot. dare you. found lovely smock wear bathroom? That's completely untrue, hardcore WWE-stans r/sc, sub always mostly anti-WWE terms product made always way people disliked business practices people would defend (especially Saudi deal went through).

But ever since news Owen's death especially they've handled Covid-19 came past weeks vast majority sub seems critical way Vince team run company. Damn. I'm sorry people selfish short-sighted. Stay healthy sick anymore? Would say it‚Äôs pretty life changing, even get better? fearful economy hurt? look S. Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, got contained without resorting draconian measures. Social distancing+tests+contact tracing enough flatten curve.

Meanwhile US still lot idiots would rather die wearing goddamn mask, four months deep pandemic. there's stable genius suggesting disinfectant injection kill virus. got viral meningitis 15, I'm 32 brain never fully recovered. What's worse everyone saw never accepted mental faculties deteriorated permanently. hope make full recovery. stupid. get Cuomo trying discourage people visiting states COVID rise, he's insuring people come back NY infected vacations going go work spread rather stay home isolate themselves. slum known Dharavi. contained shit. reporting testing. condition bad India! People starting behave we're past it, numbers increasing alarming rate. one gives shit, government fucked big time! guys think situation USA bad idea what's going India! happens elect corrupt, communal, criminal illiterate leader! pandemic completely destroyed whatever little faith country.

That‚Äôs world locked months, it‚Äôs rolling thing. 

Cases hospitalizations deaths. 

We seeing trend lower cases due restrictions place. gone now, people ignored threat thought meant pandemic over. We‚Äôre seeing surge cases lot areas, starting see surge hospitalizations well. likely means surge death coming. 

The fucked part states seeing trends almost nothing stop aside lip service. compounds, start seeing record breaking deaths top hospitalizations top cases *all once* they‚Äôre severely screwed it‚Äôs even funny Events Iran, surge Italy, representative worst case scenario. death toll fake China's. left: ‚Äúno one watches Fox News. channel dead ‚Äú

Also left: ‚Äúfox news guilty killing millions viewers. ‚Äú

Fuck sub. 70% number statistical model perfect situation. Spanish flu around 1/3rd viruses lower. wish 70% number never locked everyone fact. TONS TONS factors play immunity level hard pressed find 70% number real world.  sub particular I‚Äôve found binary. Get covid = die kill someone else. Don‚Äôt get covid = live. one really acknowledges devastating locking world ways sub. Reading hundreds comments tells they‚Äôre young fully comprehend it. Wish place talk impact virus lockdown definitely lol certain traitor insisted impliment federal guidelines like EVERY civilized society did. needed MASKS instead let idiot wingnuts fed bad info anarchic-right media machines guide policy paying it. rest nation send elderly back nursing homes like Coumo did. Thousands died due recklessness he's praised like God. sad, please stop unnecessary deaths! Wear mask. including long term consequences associated survival. Another excellent video Dr. John Campbell.

Unfortunately country state (TEXAS) headlining act video.

Stay healthy everyone. Boston, literally question asked (besides contact info) ""Have protest?"" negative get follow-up.

But knows, that's personally experienced. That's bit tendentious put mildly. people I've talked sort reaction frustrated iffy news recently vaccine development, downright angered appears Moderna done playing fast loose facts, releasing press release vastly oversold data looks pump dump. mention even Gilead mixed results remdesivir since initial trial data release. Virtually everyone know desperate good news vaccine drugs things anger us false hope peddled form snake oil companies trying oversell they've done, part draws attention resources away things might actually help. problem disturbingly large percentage voting population anti-intellectual anti-science. can't even believe type words, are.  Seeing non-chalant mask around chin ""it still counts"" people that, pretty good round Depew. Always heavy-set white folks tank tops, oddly enough dystopian you. tourists came back infected got tested/came hospital treatment, hopefully asked theyve recently. Yea worry people taking &amp; quickly distribute it. also worry long term side effects &amp; whether they‚Äôre testing older, vulnerable people. think we‚Äôre still wearing masks fall, COVID numbers &amp; flu numbers decline. we‚Äôll see. Sure, United States way ""better"" New Zealand. 

WTH talking about? Ah, excessive capitalization, mark rational well thought formal letter I‚Äôve actually started experimenting dehydrating foods. Making jerkies. ham jerky ended tasting like bacon. 

One day soon, I‚Äôm going get dehydrator make dried fruits meat snacks.

And buy local find good quality organic meats use. It‚Äôs worth shot least Wait, not? thought herd immunity could reached viral threat eventually. instantly thought meme! fucking *moron* take ""very little"" mean ""none all"" go attack. Words meaning, dipshit. looked California‚Äôs numbers... exactly lockdown do? guys pretty much plateaued 2 weeks in, held daily cases steady another two, it‚Äôs growing fairly consistently since. starting open things even option? 

You added 6500 cases 6/23 barely 1000 statewide lockdown initiated. u/Jake_Bluth feel comments now? feeling Texas, Arizona, Florida, Etc?

Do still think understood data? Exponential growth jump this, seem upset ""bad faith"" comment. want reiterate reason responding assuming arguing bad fath. empty assumption, painting disingenous.

It empty assumption. comment specifically mentions American. say Black people, specifically referring African diaspora present North America. referring Africans, know anything population. 

Black people 100% Sub-Saharan African. post mention's Vitamin levels associated darker skin; however, precisely point. every Black person dark skin; moreover, reasons Vitamin deficiency, pointed out. Black person Vitamin deficiency, mean deficiency caused skin color. 

It's discussion ""certain races"" higher susceptibility certain conditions uncomfortable. fact treating fraction genetic makeup 100%. akin one drop rule used thing America. AI, metric known feature importance dictates contribution feature overall importance model, essentially another way control certain aspect. argument race likely important feature discussion way people address race inconsistent.

You're American, yes, worldviews different. think read known history American medical system Black people, see often answer ""because racism"".

My anecdotes construct entire argument. anecdotes add another story history racism medical community. Yes, people misdiagnosed told go home often; however, people easily represented Black issue Black.

To give idea widespread issue is. study done two resumes exactly submitted job posting. difference is, names modified one ""ethnic"" name (American study btw). Stereotypical ""white"" names (Whiteness whole construct want address right now) got 50% call backs job positions. problem bad, minority individuals second name use specifically get jobs.

That's medical example, let's jump (American studies well).

* 50% white medical trainees believe Black people feel less pain white people (check American Association Medical Colleges)

* Infant mortality rate Black babies higher others, EVEN CONTROL EDUCATION INCOME. **Socioeconomic status strongest predictor medical care US**; however, changes factor race (not terms genetics, treatment based perceptions). baby born Black mother Master's degree ""far worse"" survival chance White mother 8th grade education. Even famous tennis player Serena Williams, severe complications giving birth went ignored.

* Tuskegee Syphilis Study - even need go one

In fact, really want go anymore studies questionnaires given future active medical personnel illustrates almost died blood clot doctor care know read blood test result.

Also, ""Black People Immune"" thing joke twitter. like ""World War 3"" memes unfortunate misspellings particular military branch. participant threads, people obviously knew respiratory virus anyone could get. laughing fact several organization confused COVID-19 infecting Africa headlines ridiculous painted aspect. 

It matter election year. Black people treated year round, 24/7, past 400 years. can't even go run new neighborhood without talk police officer asking stretching front yard house paid for. 

If take step back actually look racist policies implemented America, actually see KPI's exist based racial treatment. bad, determine quality one's education likelihood go university based zip code (this relevant due segregation exists America day). favorite part college kid tested positive. idea got it, lot guys fraternity tested positive üôÑ responded headline. it? Here‚Äôs thing don‚Äôt understand comments like these. 

Do think ICU stay walk park? Even death rate lot lower, ICUs still filled (and appears are) that‚Äôs problem. There's way I'm taking vaccine Bill Gates that's sure. man medical qualifications st main crusade life population control. thank you. edit: can't control people. look information Denmark. Kindergarten early school first reopen three-four weeks ago 46 cases now.  keep saying deep south California's numbers mirror Florida

Seems prejudices bigotry might guiding though processes No, really is. Cases rising sharply, ICU admissions, death rate dropping suggesting virus might weakening. Viruses evolve like dont kill hosts. future scary march, things already scary, future scariest. future pled GOP know-nothings come senses see inevitable didnt listen scientists. future getting. Buckle up. Yeah, also inflating COVID deaths get paid per-death (but COVID) basis /S Depends crowded neighborhood is. 

The point mask prevent direct cloud aerosolized particles coming breath. particles diffuse drop open air.

If outside area sufficient space people maintain feet distance, space open air job mask would done, better Imagine believing cut tshirt bandana, cloth mask, surgical mask filter virus 0.00125 microns size. Silly say loud, it? I'm surprised, US 10 times population countries

So? larger population means *easier* improve lives citizens larger tax base better buying power. considering vastness culture lifestyles United States 

The US less culturally diverse European countries, usually one native language culture, lot time higher percentage non-whites non-Christians. Cultural diversity nothing issues discussing anyway, culture precludes empathy fellow man. 

Trump objectively rac√≠st, misogyn√≠stic, sex√≠st, dim person. cannot deny without denying objective facts. Trump also tone-deaf, like put rally anniversary KKK attack Black activists called 'Ax Handle Saturday' city one worst r√°ce massacres US history happened. 

I agree inflammatory statements like helpful, surprising view people support rac√≠st race-traitors. US, white people know like interact police minority. disproportionately targeted, subsequently treated violence harsher application law. People every r√°ce commit similar levels cr√≠me control economic status. 

Trump struggled drink glass water, made fool making show able it, well spending ten minutes justifying strange walk ramp. 

The Karen meme rac√≠sm, apply white people. person race, sex, creed Karen. name belligerent, obnoxious, rude person. comes stereotype middle aged white people this, mean people it. poor people dying went interests capital - might see police something 'uncontrollable' young people downstate confirm 90% people wearing anything social distancing. Yeah, think it‚Äôs much worse Covid don‚Äôt get human interactions would normally get ‚Äì family visitors, even doctors nurses trying stay room (and come wearing facemasks PPE). People aren‚Äôt even help talk it. Yes. Yes. thousand times YES! understanding cases go up, 2-3 weeks hospitalizations go up, 2 weeks deaths go up.

I hope reason deaths won‚Äôt go (younger folks better treatment) far pattern held huge spikes hospitalizations. sustainable lead deaths.

Edit: typo Sounds like time Gram stopped seeing grandkids ever again. announced presented it. coming him. insane variable - 'just flu', others absolutely wrecks them. train approaching, many tracks, many - can't tell you. need avoid people. want crowd. 

You want breeze blowing someone else's breath face.


Stay 6ft apart wear mask. ""master businessman"" think would made MAGA masks cash promote reelection. heat body 48C bro Tempted something similar.

I live England. That's true. prescribed something mean less likely abuse it. case people use opiates pain get addicted either. individual level person person whether propensities toward addiction. people find start using abusable medication. sure people don‚Äôt realize this.. moron wheels keeps trying shift focus ‚Äúavailable beds‚Äù... meaningless.  Long time?

They're speedrunning herd immunity.

*points temple* China welded people‚Äôs doors shut prevented anyone leaving Wuhan. Rightfully never happen USA. Plus knows actual case count China is. know we've using birth control getting pregnant anyway, think stop taking pill scientists say virus detrimental effects 20, 30 years line form new conditions strike you‚Äôre older vulnerable. need protected. Masks, glass barriers, better pay, free healthcare, testing, etc. Huge amount posts ""I tested negative, definitely virus"" listing loads random symptoms. subreddit hypochondriac's wet dream. leadership inept uneducated masses voted in.

There's evidence Chinese troops attacked Indian solders Indian land. There's evidence used sticks nails attached. India proof this, would've presented fatal wounds dead soldiers would show it. intruded border, neither anybody now, posts captured,‚Äù Modi said tell Prime Minister Modi. Chinese intrude Indian land hand hand combat, Indian troops intruded Chinese territory India aggressor. FWIW, protests socialize distant mandated mask usage, cities FL/TX/AZ experiencing uptick infections.

It turns masks strategic social distancing bare enough contain virus, even that's much people.

Also yeah, agree comment. America great moment arsenal democracy like, 1942-1945, country celebrated tire fire least century. good fortune get bombed rubble like Europe. What? good xtian (John 3:16 every cup!) owners N keeping truth employees customers? Coulda knocked crowbar. ... referencing Wendy's joke. okay. Yes, also carriers. bring home families. Also puts adults risk. social distancing, masks=adults risk every time spend 10+ minutes infected child. ++ happening GA to. weeks cool drinking spots filled people. I've heard scientists say much contradicting shit covid isnt even worth paying attention to.  Get facts logic. want read headlines berate rhetorical ‚Äúthey‚Äù feel blame this. Iran sort got lightly compared happened UK New York Americans smart inventing doesn‚Äôt mean smart policy. It‚Äôs like thinking genius musician would good CEO oil they‚Äôre good music.

We ban use internet certain activities. cannot use internet threaten harm people.

But internet really another form self-expression. really asking limit free speech.

Given already limit speech certain context (again, threatening violence others), see problem. normal times 1/4 deaths India official cause death death certificate.

Sure families know relative died bury there‚Äôs official record never makes statistics. usage isnt abuse like examples provided. Sure minor impacts sleep food schedules, different going cup coffee day coffee next day. minor impact aside rise symptoms Adderall meant treat. Cinderella got ball? solution, I'm giving facts. Idiots still thinking survive=full recovery. shorten life 20 years line make quality life suffer. increases chances getting cancer‚Äîthe effects long term. there's good chance would ineligible unemployment quit. Also found researchers looking it. there's too. happy spread factual information help anyone broaden horizons knowledge base, even mostly falls dead ears. long somebody gets it, worth it. me??? Exact experience here. noncomplying entire adolescence part, gave Dexedrine try 21 think. overwhelmed realizations of, normal people feel, fuck didn‚Äôt listen doctors kid, could gone much life school easier time it, much development miss on, etc etc. oh well, focus now. Disagree making people aware risks. People given lot information people know interpret data busy trying help patients. Also there, earlier reports completely wrong.

""Dr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, pathology professor University Chicago School Medicine, stressed patients mild illness recover ""with lasting two months said, turns mild cases seem persist. bad part time there's still things flat know.

The general public pretty much continued main stream media tried keep viewers watching. point choice go work living paycheck paycheck pray get it. shut everything essential people end losing home plan place. go work get it, fun crippling debt hospital bills, eventually cause declare bankruptcy, lose house anyways.   Well one ex‚Äôs never abused also lot issues taking it.

Same goes childhood friend.

Why triggered sharing life experiences public forum? Chicago. 95%+ people see wearing masks. even vaccine common cold. Yeah too. seem falling ole 'it 40 degrees April home. Global climate change ass' syndrome. 

Thats ok, xoming atleast 60% us things change. means almost Americans personally know someone COVID-19. ""Indifference""? mean? Apathy? Good luck! that‚Äôs logical fallacy - picking pessimistic case validates pessimistic viewpoint going forward. 

Where‚Äôs NY Times talking this? Globally, cases spiked, deaths risen. happening two months. town live would guess 90% businesses rely tourism way another. Supermarkets, banks, accountants etc. tourist businesses, serve people work tourism. citizen allowed bombs? normal times India 1/4 deaths get official cause death certificate. Imagine it‚Äôs like hospitals overwhelmed point able take care new cases. gonna ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt letting anyone country‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre barring specifically countries x, y, z entering country‚Äù?

I feel like it‚Äôs work statement name specific countries, it‚Äôs lockdown-y telling everyone stay cancelled thanks supreme court India already CFs, gonna make worse? üò≠ Probably triple reality. Poor nations misclassified deaths. know one death February called coronavirus 99% sure was. lock swiftly done one first countries close borders. Luckily everyone generally respected lock social distancing. before. make beer. sure tastes like shit, maybe? also prevented counties cities requiring masks. responsible lots deaths. since Texas refused expand Medicaid ACA... can‚Äôt wait see response billions unpaid hospital bills. Many hospitals Texas closed reign. assumed moderately intelligent.

So resorting ad hominems instead continuing argument invalid.

What's funny word ""invalid"" debate means I'm committing logical fallacy. I'm commiting logical fallacy all, argument invalid. simply know words mean.

I pointed logical inconsistency argument responded questioning intelligence. Poor form.

You even address point, definition, owning guns ""natural right"" due fact point many instances governments able restrict right. 
The right guns much dependent laws customs particular governments, universal, clearly inalienable. I'm using definition point out.

That's fine want retreat argument, encourage least attempt debate good faith future. actually Avoid going crowded places. Why? people come together crowds, likely come close contact someone COIVD-19 difficult maintain physical distance 1 metre (3 feet).

Because US/Swedish strategy letting seems irrational one (of many) reasons: doesn‚Äôt risk harmful mutation go way virus allowed spread rampant among millions people? People fly anywhere, southernmost states. theory bullshit stop spreading it. basis problem leaders ""asked Americans sacrifice"" did, even encouraged people to...

If, like countries, system spoken one voice, US now...


(And counterproductive behaviour parts population, compounded propaganda leaders ""on side"" (as question sides...) ).



I first metaphor ' ""2+2=4"" subject debate', better metaphor ""there's debate existence atoms"". People scientific background think there's debate whether atom particle, wave statistical cloud, means ""atom"" meaning. 



They think debate exactly COVID-19, means exist.



That's leaders spoken one voice, didn't... Give week. ICU capacity filling deaths soon reverse trend. happened two months ago first wave. Good hear better mate. Keep safe. Maybe true. relevant casino government. saying seem implicitly claim fez Norway, Denmark Finland sustainable situation right now. make sense. countries far back normal Sweden, none see deaths daily basis efficient system testing tracing running.

Just remember virus hasn‚Äôt around long enough determine true long term, permanent effects. literally don‚Äôt know anything people experiencing right permanent virus around ~six months. 

This article originally posted Reuters headline effects COVID respiratory effects. That‚Äôs way less sensational news source. 

No article say effects permanent, purely long term scientific data isn‚Äôt there. guess ‚Äúnever fully recover‚Äù headline refers financially recovering. doesn‚Äôt explicitly say anywhere article. like 20 cm, saw video dancers perspective held phone danced always got ""You're fear mongering!""

No, pointing possible research bad idea let unresearched virus spread like wildfire. Noy viruses tame regular flu, cause crazy side effects.

It's California got creamed, large scale outbreak yet nearly completely vulnerable population spread like wildfire. live here, I‚Äôm certainly hoping that‚Äôs correct too. median age infection rate steadily ticked down, may mean comparatively less rate deaths NYC, hospitals already struggling. that‚Äôs always anyway.

either make get test first take risk comment removed political: exactly supposed ""avoid politics"" thread politics influencing people's reaction outbreak? Get away us diseased freak little research antibody test; honestly doesn‚Äôt tell much anything surely won‚Äôt tell past it, antibodies develop different times virus presence therefore mean overcome infection. husband‚Äôs work constant antibody testing, one tests IgM antibody Presents within days coming Contact virus (usually symptoms occur) signal either fighting it.

Provincial authorities regulate sector pay residents. army medics soon, replaced federal government paid Red Cross personnel; however short term solution best.

Fixing LTC ways simple: better accommodations (e.g. ensure AC big issue summer, especially Montreal), mostly private (single) rooms, PSWs paid better full time jobs single facility, better training, additional professional healthcare stafff infection control training, better infection control plans, serious public health inspections (means inspectors paperpushers), better visitor control, possibly disallow for-profit ownership necessarily spend additional billion two. federal government help cash. Criminal charges managers negligence causing death many many class action lawsuits would beneficial well stimulate change. together enough would good start. Pessimistically three months get reasonably good fix place.

. kid fun. still remember headache spinal tap! Well, least Tuskegee experiment experiment, incredibly unethical racist. 

This stupidly allowing virus run rampant for... don‚Äôt know... stock market? Texas Florida 0 income tax states?

Sadly that's happen point. know probably maga face masks wear right? (*mostly kidding*) woman 20's otherwise healthy contracting Covid-19 required double lung transplant.

Warning: picture one lungs removed wish people seen story. Maybe might take Covid-19 seriously. I‚Äôll wait 5 days. I‚Äôve waiting 3 weeks see uptick deaths it‚Äôs nothing continued downtrend. It‚Äôs even flattening. Dude... work certain major shipping company airport, building aur conditioning. fans. uniform shirts made pretty much 70% plastic. pulling around 3,000 lb. containers packages (120lb woman, thank bruce brandon lee teaching momentum stuff) heinous humidity heat... *wearing mask every day*. wear them. fans ceiling around scattered. sweating bullets... like playing sports. *not stopped working* throughout pandemic. 

I fucking tolerance grocery store bitches cannot bear cover faces hour. Selfish maniacs, desperately seeking someone enemy. cannot understand grasp people dying. check last couple months sub see lock worth crap.

But want play game look certain politicians bragging low immigration since started College? I‚Äôm worried son elementary school. least 18+ understand disease fully capability operate safely (not will). 5-10 year olds? touch everything, forget wash hands, good luck keeping mask day. cough sneeze without covering mouths often too. Schools open closed weeks later massive outbreaks country. Calling now. Look like got lots upvotes though. think makes sense. course protests huge gatherings short term outdoors. Reopening creates constant stream people going places around others, indoors. see Yes and? I‚Äôm saying protests didn‚Äôt spread it. even specifically pointed work healthcare would start seeing now. I‚Äôm pointing coming next 1-2 weeks impact protests really felt. think it'll go Monday week bunch bullshit news come 2 3 weeks it'll rise again. understand lol think we‚Äôre not.

so much fun attend. epic story. hope trilogy. 100% mask utilization, even sailors sea.

Travel restrictions, quarantine moving states, contact tracing, more.

But what‚Äôs really big there‚Äôs ban enlistment anyone hospitalized CoVID19. know bad messes body even survive aren‚Äôt taking risks bringing troops never 100%. relaxed restrictions, may eligible now. See Germany, issue, looks like donate now. donated yet, intend soon. He‚Äôs General Surgeon Chief surgery hospital here. 
No, he‚Äôs expert viruses. guarantee knows general population. also knows what‚Äôs going hospitals, hospitals nationwide it‚Äôs looking great. you‚Äôd like choose believe it‚Äôs fake, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm convince you. fact, I‚Äôm hoping hear good news worried electives canceled again. Take care. yeah u didnt fuck faggot Masks mandatory people still won‚Äôt wear üò≥ Makes wonder households pass ones everyone drinks bottle mouthwash, cook tastes food puts spoon back in. guess eating pass on.

Maybe hugging families. ones close-talker.

I take care elderly mother hard hearing talk right face, loudly. Would terrible catch it. made laugh wake crazy dog. Shame. also nice one. That's ""why need rules"", that's ""why need fix culture"". education literally unable grow up. two go hand hand. Someone else also replied mentioning vitamin D, Covid? exemptions essential workers. would think qualifies.  economy shambles federal government terrible job taking care citizens. Supply lines running thin. Denying facts conspiracists. Good, luck. Netherlands never fully closed either. Shops open, could go outside. social distance washing hands trick. 

We closed schools etc Six weeks. open children twelve six weeks now. Restaurants outside places open amount time. going well, still cases nothing cannot handle. 

Testing came widely available month too. 

The big difference? good leadership clear message wanted best country. People ignoring rules got fines. masks everyone, testing everyone, full lockdown. good leadership large part people right thing. god, you‚Äôve put feelings words. Like little children throwing temper tantrum. Choose one. Freedom free virus. kept getting strep over. intense bouts growing caused tonsils scar up, become pitted. went college would alternative bout strep, general tonsil infection. said ""screw it"" saw specialist get removed 22. 

Best decision ever made. get strep enough tonsils become spoges disease. would get colds 2-5 times year would last 2 weeks average. Since tonsils get cold maybe year, lasts 3-5 days instead, get congestion anymore. colds also incredibly mild now. strep throat infections entirely gone. 

I can't recommend tonsilectomy enough, painful recovery huge unexpected boost immune response getting removed. good reminder value vote.

All don‚Äôt vote: people country could die later indirect result. Unfortunately lot - tens millions - people much worse positions either work queue food banks live. must really frightening lot people choices. decent 2 weeks ago. People got sharply careless around then. out, shopping touching groceries, carts, checkout lane, last thing want get hands near face. mask stays get home wash hands. basically spend whole trip treating hands like they're really stinky sticky. fun allergy season, works far! comment really made day. sleep smile face now. Thank you. Yeah :/ looking months now. I‚Äôm dead guess it‚Äôs fine. feel overkill going lung specialist I‚Äôve gone bunch referrals tests point think maybe nerves don‚Äôt like me. Nothing really it. What's big deal? guys like people wear masks virus deadly get world deadly look like bunch scared little bitches. Problem solved right? coronavirus I'm 45 two illnesses said sure death. reading idiotic posts people think experts media said so. feel sorry you. Sit outside. Well get likely need ventilator, make sure vit levels good hydrate. I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt seen creativity individuality mask design. Trump missed major opportunity market MAGA masks. BLM masks getting thing, neutral random masks.

I want mask smiling mouth design big handlebar mustache. much ask? Hey northern neighbor!

My roommate escapes Chicago apartment Kenosha every then, weeks ago came back saying going go back Kenosha quite while. asked why, said one favorite bars open serving, none staff wearing masks, see anybody sanitize wash hands (now, totally possible staff keeping proper hygiene practices, ever service industry need make visible guests--even peace mind), weird fucking reason, bartender running around *barefoot*. really want know twilight zone bar ventured to. American Dumbshitery. posted much, either bot paid post.

Stand statement.

 well good. portion population gay? test positive... get test Monday... shall see. okay i‚Äôll get tin foil hat ready use vasopressors. meds squeeze much blood towards vital organs possible keep organs perfused alive, comes expense fingers, toes, hands, feet, anything far away core.

Sometimes needed long lack blood extremities causes die off. patient's black, shriveled dead. recovering that, thing left lop four off.

It's rare complication. least something I've read seen online, happen. alternative death.

Personally know would chosen, get make call people. Folk hang life matter cost seems, even cost 'living'. fair Italy past peak, sure US peaked yet. Even deaths slowing, afraid rise soon. He‚Äôs moron. basically saying self involved doesn‚Äôt effect directly relevance me.   
This guy act like sky falling get COVID False safety reassurance. People eventually find virus spreading wherever people close other. retroactive study. Looks promising controlled study. done first sweep care home circuit easy deaths rate slow going regular population? Insane, 2020 can‚Äôt smart enough help selfless scale back life going protect loved ones! recent research points true. Yay! Here‚Äôs good times ahead. literally crazy every time think it. Talk place collective conscience. place people actually give shit other, imagine that. Disinfecting objects logical. use soap (cheaper; safer), items need immediately quarantined 9 days significantly reduce potential viral load them. imagine like come fall? Covid influenza double whammies find sad annoying. surprise though I'd rather ""right"" popular. stopped caring Karma points shortly joining gaming subreddit. End day without civil discussion sides end shouting cliches. states definitely see echo chamber effect people decided mask wearing hill want die rather coming best solution.

Where Spanish Flu Come From?

Scientists still know sure Spanish Flu originated, though theories point France, China, Britain, United States, **first known case** reported Camp Funston Fort Riley, Kansas, March 11, 1918.

Some believe infected soldiers spread disease military camps across country, brought overseas. March 1918, 84,000 American soldiers headed across Atlantic followed 118,000 following possibly imply we've built ""the greatest nation""?? metric? We're abysmal failure country pandemic laid bare painful way. dread, horror, uncertainty we're feeling right taste impoverished Americans enduring years.

But empty assumption, painting disingenous.

it's data oriented statistic deeply anchored factual basis. statistics Vitamin deficiency levels illustrate clearly. understand mechanism behind Vitamin absorption understand matter skin color, matter precise mix- darker pigmentations less likely (in northern climate) absorb vitamin Sun, compared lighter pigments. opinion. 

With respect, anecdotal data deficient vitamin levels dismantle overarching truth. Vitamin levels affected diet, supplementation myriad individual host factors. that's bigger point. Nobody suggesting every black individual deficient every white person dandy (I deficient, pretty much everyone live) things considered, darker skin tones less likely absorb sufficient Vitamin D.

I understand idea variations prevalence conditions based something simple skin color race something they're uncomfortable with, 'feels racist' denying existence based feeling, greatest respect make variations go away. two examples mentioned clear ones- dozens conditions exhibit region racial biases -- disagree I've given far likely blanket disagree matter what-- scenario I'd assume commenting bad faith.

Your example treated nice hear. Particularly afro comment. I'm sorry experienced that. Without diminishing experience, think worth mentioning people- colors-- similarly tales tell experiences- people ignored, told go home, call they're deaths door pandemic. Overwhelmingly see countries like US even health care systems stretched means able experience higher level care given consideration respect without. However worth noting countries operate model. living observations noted despite equal access financial component seeking care. 

 I'm also typing mobile, person who's going ead I'm exactly writing karma, neither you. appreciate response hope appreciate mine basis even though disagree 

I understand worldview shaped experiences (as mine)- debate mostly hinged around fact feel comment bad faith- nothing say really change that, feeling. hence really going detail response, fruitless

However Final reiteration: trying minimize discussion racism. want people clinical experience use ""it's racism"" use support agenda diminishing away life-saving research physiological factors. first important address unquestionable latter actionable information right right now. 

 find interesting read accounts formerly championing ""asian virus"" affect blacks switched focus highlighting racism involvement covid mortality. racism , poor Hispanic certainly highlighting poorer Caucasian richer caucasion. Simply one color worse racism. That's extent story..  election year, race issues-- like 4 years ago unsurprisingly spiking according Google trends hashtag data; invariably groups vested interest highlighting racism root cause mortality pandemic --so present solution group-- voting fix that-- way could root cause understood (for example), mostly hypertension obesity. Nobody vote ones highlight that. 

That simply issue. want downplay please, take anti-scientific approach hide know clinical characteristics support narrative. US statements like 'black inviduals treated worse counterparts' ring true here. Access free all. significant black population health workers medical staff; skew appears . doesn‚Äôt make less horrid response, especially considering plenty resources us country make right instead yanking away hot spot. Even couldn‚Äôt pool advocate less hit states right now, absolutely could, there‚Äôs frickin way federal government couldn‚Äôt secure testing meet demand Austin needs right now. 

That‚Äôs PR accurately, BS statement I‚Äôve ever seen one. know it‚Äôs it‚Äôs article, that‚Äôs crock garbage absolutely wrong way handling area that‚Äôs surging hard cases right now. fact, kind gives suspicion it‚Äôs get way way worse Austin travel hotspots then.

Though they're also becoming *extremely* bored staying home. son works State Dept Houston said days ago, ""I never thought I'd anxious get back work, really am."" But, know: HOUSTON. Unless cough sneeze face, no? Simply breathing doesn‚Äôt expel enough virus cause enough viral load lead infection, droplets spewed right mouth/eyes I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs given. Maybe not, possibility benefit early mistakes others shifted last innings game. Assuming successes failures countries (or you) made public, late players benefit, moreover little excuse benefit. Maybe I'm optimistic, somebody relative importance even average mind able grasp even delta statistics, that's one things either understand fully all. (In experience anyways) minimizing effect cause, effective outcome modulated fields, obviously, that's point. 

In US, probably hurt us long run...? wager, I'd put comfortably individualism uninformed choice.

They also closed air travel foreigners coming early, really helped. went MOB friends Trumps Golf courses Mar lago. Walking around Barcelona day, I‚Äôd estimate 1 every 5 privately owned shops/boutiques process permanently closing down.

Sorry felt uncomfortable. mask 10 seconds room one masked person getting temperature taken far less likely get covid went grocery store let‚Äôs say eat restaurant. Red Cross doesn‚Äôt want blood anyway considering going get antibody test. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* really. assuming never mutation new COVID variation. There's reason get new flu vaccine every single year. COVID potentially *lot* dangerous ""ordinary"" flu. Looks like personal theory virus slowly breaking system prolonged period time starting realise bit. Pass fucking laws...the entire time pandemic US FUCKING guidelines. equates whatever fuck want. country sucks news source said Austin longer testing without¬†COVID-19¬†symptoms currently enough tests number people seeking them. many soft cunts sounds much better. red cross center btw. church, place space available. hospitalize everyone order give them. antivirals taken orally might work. unit produce Sinopharm vaccine Sinovac one? Yes. indoor dining. It‚Äôs feasible right now. It‚Äôs supposed n95 mask. mask everyone going enough people aren‚Äôt proper social distancing sanitizing everything. meant supporters disappear like miracle! Someone must tell US sometimes better last instead first. Well maybe Let guess, $500 hole? they're realizing huge number people showing antibodies months. yep--you could totally get again. Covid 19 racist confirmed cancel covid agree however planning going bar 4th July saying left restaurant many people strokes odd. I‚Äôm cautious side well. wear safety glasses top mask venture out, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel comfortable either can‚Äôt recover death that's case, time allow large gatherings they're outside people required wear masks. Common sense trump data though. data protest testing protesters 1% positivity rate less - basically background. Protesters outside, mostly masked outdoor transmission 10x harder indoor transmission. Prob less many people dont get symptoms arent sick enough get tested. Prob least ten million cases us alone Same. much better month ago fear may never run (I ran 5k week previously) scaring me. spend whole next day recovering. never seem fully catch breath. sucks. makes better. 

Got 

Blm protests = good 

Going giant beach = bad like 15-20 years ago, couple guys worked time would go strip club lunch least week. claimed place served ""good food"". back forth people speak regular basis. fact there‚Äôs long-term damage devastating effects children (delayed).

A week ago neighbors family 7 went Outer Banks Florida. explained would contact people. wish could essential trips grocery wearing mask. thought trying flatten curve. never plans stop everyone getting it, make everyone get longer period time. Grocery stores necessity, people need able buy food. Target Walmart fall grocery stores locations. wouldn‚Äôt issue limiting number people inside store though. fringe people suggesting case would think would see uniform rise cases across US, especially big liberal cities large protests like Chicago New York hasn‚Äôt case. Chicago New York great right now. numbers clearly going down. Ontario look actual graph data. blatantly wrong based actual numerical data, question unable understand data wilfully fear mongering us still working essential got shit besides $1200. üôÑ 0 state income tax. still get local tax, federal income tax, FICA Social security taken virus awful, lack common sense people (especially here) disturbing. 

Expecting government give answers need. They‚Äôre guidelines. Open interpretation what‚Äôs best you. anti-mask thing. Even intelligent least functional real world adults even get caught it. useless harmful, every medical professional wear them? modern medicine based masks, gloves, hand washing. prevents infection. can't imagine know this. common knowledge. personal theory people masks fear death illness most. feel powerless least control fear. power face death deny existence. pity compassion - get feel risk pose others. Well, shit. 

I think something like this. area *was* fine.... first two. 

Then got PhD game theory made money shale boom.

So looks like mismatch would actually due fact since worldwide number, many people milder symptoms, particularly poorer countries, able get tested. people, end ICU die it, would tested got hospital.

Essentially deaths easier track cases, though definitely deaths reported well Probably considerate people staying home, be. leaves selfish people take restaurant tables.

Anyway reading (literally tonight) infections vagus nerve cause CFS, comment. made realize chronic fatigue truly started around age 20 contacted form herpes virus. read article doctor stated treating people successfully CFS Valtrex (an anti virus prescribed herpes), said believes CFS vagus nerve infected.

So found bottle Valtrex, haven‚Äôt taken years. took tonight continue taking see improves fatigue. Vyvanse obviously helps years it, doesn‚Äôt affect strongly. 

Have ever tried anti viral researched it? hope works. Yep. Honestly, think cutaneous manifestations may undervalued here. use conjunction symptoms infections. novel, get it. 


I think im speaking subset minimised cutaneous manifestations ignored prior primary diagnosis. Look skin. important. 40% Mainers afford $400 emergency pandemic. negative birth rate relies tourism industry survive. Fishing industry hit hard Trump's Trade War, lumber industries outsourced elsewhere.

We need Green New Deal, like ASAP. read article, years ago, said poorer people tip emphasize server. So, want sick work, die street? I'm sure neither option come back bite them. Go mom's funeral, get sick, get fired, get cut social assistance, become homeless, ensure virus continues. üëç people believe one conspiracy theory often believe all.

You‚Äôre using fatality rate predicted number infected individuals, need know number infected individuals know fatality rate. also haven‚Äôt taken account pending cases. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something here, seems like erroneous way trying calculate many people actually infected. They're shutdown now. They've started counting cases patrons became infected Harper's (college bar) return hometowns hundred miles away equally reckless irresponsible overcrowded parties too. Rinse repeat spread ensuing event. exact experience giving blood. Covid-19 give viral meningitis? different virus? I'm truly nervous this, already difficult dealing current outbreaks, see would possible avoid community spread crowded touristic spots, specially willing travel ones take precautions seriously.  Woah. Woah. WOAH! know jesus died breathe CO2 like corporate overlords want too?!

Huh?

Such drama, Karen I'm still recovering mild case almost two weeks first symptoms still shortness breath, even say true, small possibility still terrify me. one estimated one confirmed? maybe want power lifter, want functional strength go toss hay bails, till soil, chop wood up. live Iowa / Illinois border see Iowa time. I'm fan governor, least mandated masks public. I'm Iowa, even think virus looming - hardly masks seen. Interestingly local positive case numbers really starting climb 2 weeks Iowa completely opened up. would say depends live. outbreak area likely it‚Äôs Covid might want get tested. "" church"" opened early without proper safety protocol (ie, masks social distancing) explains what's going ICU/capacity rn.

But gets even higher intensity (as I'm chalking memorial day culture current rates), would due protests.

I agree now, protests cannot attributed full accounted right now, we'll wait weeks outcome. many murders far weekend?

Setting new records?

Mayor beetlejuice Awesome Yup spike time Bad time read recovering mild case :(

I'm sorry. personally believe odds still side. Even lot people ongoing/intermittent health issues going forward, there's reason believe 1/2 bucket.

Possibly, impossible make blanket statements comes health. Depending is, could still feel sick recover quicker never feel anything all. smart enough see racism inherent system probably smart enough see benefit wearing mask.

But maybe that's ""liberal academic indoctrination"" speaking. lost goddamn mind envisioning (every deep southerner‚Äôs) Uncle Jimmy American flag tank top Texas flag swim trunks, sitting couch, cooler beer one side, cooler fireworks other. ‚ÄúWell, kids, show must go on...‚Äù Seems like gist need reeeeeeaaaaaalllllly flexible lots contingency plans kids go back school, they'll socially stunted.

Thank you! Sadly I'm shocked GOP willing let happen anymore. fucking pathetic. Yes data back up. Ot obvious less deaths deaths lagging younger folks catching it. going stay contained deaths rise end summer. Nice strawman. Lmfao. Yeah, let's completely ignore made way. obviously shitty response virus, lack healthcare....

Comorbidity plays huge factor recovery transmission things. Canada base-level healthier population go doctor reason get treated everything, time, free. there's less people ignored untreated conditions can't afford fix getting ruined virus top that. changes hospital rates death rates pandemic. Even scarier vast majority 500'000 last 3 months (~468'000). I'm absolutely shocked! 2007, mild case pneumonia could have. doctor ER told barely counted pneumonia. 

But think that. ER. would take 10 minutes walk bathroom, sit pee stand, walk bed lay down. 4 days ER getting chest xrays. 

3 days antibiotics felt great, another couple days back normal. holy shit scare death. Every night went sleep, know would ever wake morning. sneaky devil, always testing faith clear evidence logical thinking! good job we've got 2000 year old book really know truth. Yes, wearing mask bit uncomfortable times. safety safety others. 
My grandma covid November saw went brutal. slept every night small wooden chair hospital. horrible ordeal her. yes, I‚Äôm extra cautious. 
Stay safe everyone Happy see Dick Cheney John Bolton getting involved vaccine manufacturing! Important lesson: take word pol safe eat out, go bar, theater, sports event etc immense pressure business groups open damn consequences

School teachers across country: ""YES, THIS!!!"" supposed ""Drain swamp""? incorrect. 

If people want evaluate India based per capita metrics, absolutely right saying. walking around Pasadena today couldn‚Äôt believe amount restaurants going abt business usual. Everyone wasn‚Äôt wearing mask tables super close scary wearing masks impossible ? American, I'm pissed this. Months staying in, quarantining, literally almost nothing...for what?

We told stay save lives. state (MA), that. states near me: that. month in, fucking stupid protests ""reopen"" assholes holding signs saying ""let weak die"" stuff like that. leaders literally jack shit help. measly $1200 check lot people even get. Corporations businesses got huge bail outs rest us going scraps, usual.

A large portion states absolutely nothing since open borders states, going lead likely reemergence states got past first waves. I've heard people FL states talking ""taking vacation"" Massachusetts. quarantine 14 days, know won't. reopened indoor dining bet anything snowbirds dining indoors.

We could past mostly government took seriously.

I know supposed mention politics, fuck here. One political party US took seriously. One political party instead made insane conspiracy theories trying ""ruin economy win election."" No. wanted get control virus, get ahead it, get back sort ""new normal"" like countries done. selfishness ruined we're going pay price it. US citizens **only** human beings use religion excuse wear masks.











I feel people concerned level stupidity. lol

We know last months. Risk Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. another zoonotic disease coming extremely unwise desire people farm live non-human animals. disease incurable works somewhat like time-bomb brain. It‚Äôs planes, it‚Äôs borders mean, yeah. rest world part... know that. might take while. beginning March since weeks feel 100% fine again. mild symptoms yet endurance completely gone. training daily two months get back old level. fuck read? sf karens anxious?  hope people like reddit, swear feel end world, left home since Feb twice go hospital due low vitamin d, even believe masks, gloves, SD, sanitizers protect 100%, spend around 4 5 hours daily reading covid19 social media nothing positive made feel depressed time, need positive people here. still donate haven‚Äôt sex last 3 months. people, even highly trained medical professionals, countries genuinely believe wearing mask long lower overall oxygen levels raise carbon dioxide levels. 


Yes people childish delusional this, probably smaller number getting information family members countries teach this. Subservient asian stereotype. thing. people want get tested course since boarded people apartments likely let many infected die. solution would stop disease tracks lie infection dead. Oh yes point obvious I've made point well. Sounds totally safe. /s  UK outbreaks mad cow disease back - Red Cross rules people lived time period eligible donating blood. Restaurant worker here. fucking shit. ones love don‚Äôt. Unless they‚Äôre really stupid know don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù virus.  wait governments start honest numbers. read HIV drugs quickly cured people extremely strong anti virals I‚Äôm wondering don‚Äôt hear aren‚Äôt prescribed?  check history anyone saying something gives emotional reaction. purpose say outrageous things get user engagement.

Often goal get us angry get us hate country, spin narrative America falling apart shithole country. Sometimes may feel like goal get us focused hate country destabilized. maybe countries want business us supposedly receptive business them.

They really force right rise cases. let drive narrative. Indoors? Marin, county north. fucking stupid lazy fuckers country can't make damn food home? 

Learn fucking cook, wallet body thank you. also teach kids something useful instead training mindless consumers. Right now, it‚Äôs unlikely walk-ins anywhere, don‚Äôt want extra people sitting around. belong visit may resist sites. like know going many places. open minded many things . Pft. ridiculous! believes furry elephants? I've said beginning, 1 million deaths minimum. personal semi-educated guess 4-7mill end it. thought reacting first months American's stupidity outdone themselves. No, that‚Äôs antibodies work. Also come stats.

/r/ShitAmericansSay That... quite different story.  problem chart tracks data period us lockdown.

Why matter? charts (I‚Äôm sure one referring to) focus percentages. also assumes growing number young people die going kill grandma.

Where assumption made? article analysis death statistics mention high threat shrug say ""eh, people die!""?

No. trying say? analyzing death statistics putting context dismissive die?
I support wearing masks measures mitigate spread. HEY I'm taking thing seriously still! sounds like confirmation bias. Loads positive stories get front page. Paid insurance. opposed ‚Äú can‚Äôt breath ‚Äú chants protestors though Thinking grandmother you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre deal this. accept bad government hospitals too. Glad recovered! I've lived unfortunately lots hospitals. 3 tiers (top private basically like 5 star hotels, middle equivalent hospital home country imo, lowest government).

My husband poor family poor border town government hospital nowhere near bad that. I've others around country see poor conditions either. accept exist generalisation, no. What? think depends test. bunch. 
I always thought antibody tests often less accurate. knows? 

My friends definitely symptoms, could barely function. young kids got mild version. 'side' equation cretin.

So, scientists virologists one side... suggest comprises side? Wasn‚Äôt Vietnam already kicking ass March? think know exactly kind damage cause, widespread horrible potentially lifelong things ir death. know common recovery is, percentage people seeing different results.

That's scares virus is, could well make human lifespan severely reduced ultimately cripple humanity long time forever. morals. Don‚Äôt tell Montana Dakotas that, they‚Äôre pretty dedicated cause... It‚Äôs easy imagine people stupid. Someone would confuse immunity decreased risk infection. one those? God, Mexican neighbors huge family pool parties 20+ people several times week since end April. I'm worried kids. Scientists virologists one side... suggest comprises side? sure better, intelligent stupidity, hate bias talking? nails problem you? gods? envy lives hate much?

The idea blacklist make seem intelligent them, would disaster practice, would die without it, although genocide goal. able look mirror even thought genocide point, you? No. Chinese people government everything could knowledge had, lock downs absolutely brutal needed much. Unfortunately live interconnected global village today preventing viruses crossing borders impossible, stopping spreading exponentially country isn't. could make realistic looking ‚ÄúMeg‚Äù movie... doh  Curious well. framed like question, got answer, see people strongly stating consensus science -- actively spread anti-science talking point, fx climate discussion. 

People say understand science work even meant consensus, disingenuous. wrongfully described ""popular opinion"", opinion valid.

A scientific consensus means leading scientists field support theory best fit available data experimentation degree verify currently. status lot areas people think simple, settled scientific Truths, practice bet life method correct constantly.

Scientists always open evolving revising theories. Often means proposing better explanations observations, scientists work results supports new findings becomes new consensus. lot imagination creativity leftover workday. I'm exhausted. 2nd story. Thai secretary hit parked truck (it stopped busy road night, heavy rain switched lights - common occurrence.) also ended initially disgusting poor ward. writhing around agony, looked even worse. doctor tried discharge facial bruising. entering private hospital found useful eye socket, fractured skull. gone home, would funeral shortly after. 

I'm always confused mentality Thai people, dire need 'put good face,' clearly case. ""Great hospitals "" available money. pre-existing condition protection ends canceling Affordable Care Act, Covid-19 pre-existing condition.   
     
The 2.5 million Americans far risk losing health insurance.     
    
You bet life it. government buying equity. Part deal airlines give government equity warrants equivalent 10% money received. option buy certain price, anything yet. decide fully execute warrants, government (only) 3% stake AA, that's highest percentage carriers.

In words, government equity, likely never equity, product bailout. Wow thought bar lower, somehow people find way limbo it. amount effort people go avoid something simple wearing mask beyond fucked.

The US coming anytime soon, godspeed sane ones actually whatever stay safe. rest blight country humanity. people already afraid *next* pandemic they‚Äôre calling ‚Äúhigh-risk behavior‚Äù like concerts banned forever. Luckily, people aren‚Äôt (currently) positions power... test positive swab tests? saw something back someone testing negative swabs tested spinal fluid... positive. wife's low fever months. Tests negative COVID-19 consistently, far tests found cause. worrying. Great comment. people, especially risk, lens this. need add campaigns help people understand real impact, real risks. Like STD ads seem help. last part totally feel dude. Worst part random coughs popping I'm paranoid it'll happen I'm around people I'll either leave try explain, ""it's cool I've better months, funky lung issues"" like even help flu season doesn‚Äôt last year... it‚Äôs still deadly flu, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúflu *season*‚Äù reason still take Vyvanse longer? Also personality changes experience? feel made confident like, able think clearly less emotional thing keeps people believing disease real seems getting it. That, fact countries practise lockdown many sick dying. wonder that's people felt black death really took hold. Data dump friend, sane human would've known start. son acute myocarditis 11...then cross country high school. patient really stay away exercise/exertion doctor gives go ahead.

Best wishes recovery. Lets blame masks. basic social distancing.

 watched maybe 15 people congregate corner without masks. Said family.

Newsflash: dont live you, leave 6-10 feet wear face covering. go spend day grandma. Fucking stay home. Positive antibodies good thing. caught back beginning march.
It moderate case, need hospital.

Diamond virus button Luckily elderly contribute American dream, lazy fucks sit around playing bingo. /s  think lot also fact tourism down. hot. Locals part started summer hibernation. freaking hot. go back beach November. China late December. like 300 cases, China, January 20th year Oh come on. really want people stay inside rest eternity? Going beach one least irresponsible things anyone could right now. Going store/restaurant/indoor function MUCH dangerous. Well reopening gone well. Best require quarantine everyone Would excessive say ‚Äúsecond waves‚Äù seem occurring places either weren‚Äôt hit hit gently original wave covid 19 idea non-criminal personal matter takes place outside working hours ""against company policy"" biggest bullshit ever imagined reason quit well-paid job years ago.

Company policy extends employee they're working, life employer actively paying company tells completely employer's control. Post viral symptoms pretty well known, albiet really well understood, phenomenon medical community.  sub basically treats getting Coronavirus self failing point. People forgotten easy spread. great example need take seriously others duty put hundreds (even thousands line transmission) risk.

Due summer heat hayfever ordered thermometer oximeter like father story hard identify symptoms.

Its also reminder lockdown hard. Southern states absolutely locked early lockdown would likely saved lives now. Aka: Vinny Mac care epidemic began ? That's indeed disturbing number. undercounting number cases number deaths though talking CFR pandemic actually quite misleading lack knowledge. 

There's hope though, since going testing becomes widespread learn protect vulnerable able get 10%

Highly unlikely, especially considering estimated number asymptomatic. got 8 million people get through. ain‚Äôt even close hittin high score yet. üò§üò§üò§  Almost 20 days later indeed contact mods receive reply. Go figure everyone LA double digit iq  OAN chance? close Trump state TV gets sometimes. I‚Äôm hoping safe recovery tooth procedure. yeah especially around people people makes paranoid. hope you‚Äôre good healthy though. Inslee damn good job flattening curve still got people calling overreaction, understanding feeling like win.

This big problem. ""See, many cases, stay home?""

I heard well (Croatia). got strict lockdown, went basically zero cases two weeks opened last week. 50 100 cases per day people fucking stupid. cases imported places much worse situation.... people ""needing"" see relatives country shitty situation? got it. Nuns going mission place shitty situation? got it. People going clubs? got it. 

FFS people... over, stay fuck home limit social connections. thinking going coast week two kids, since things worsened talked going coast buying new computers chose new computers.... fuck travel, stay home much can. 

STAY SAFE! words, people everyone pays attention remain bubble, overlooked support workers go back forth bubble outside world. Someone ask Department Corrections ideas happens next. elaborate please? Lol. would special kind idiot think India empowered politically aware citizens. yeah Applebee's stay business pick 3 $40 meal $5 bottle bud lights

Not enticing pick 3 $14.99 $2.75 bottles bud light.

I mean may *that* outrageous think folks would still willing come cheaper price bill say 15% service fee *have* tip. restaurants 20-30 servers night. go $2.13/hr pay, lets say federal minimum wage whatever fucking ridiculously low wage, state $7.25, adding lot added cost store. prices higher even little, staff full minimum wage workers offense anyone making minimum wage saying get pay come play here. Serving fucking easy anyone never done bet pressed make weekend shift Sunday brunch almighty entitled church crowd comes rolling in. keep good staff pay hourly stay means keep adding price. 

The reason add flat percentage service fee trying find alternative tipping culture, still passing cost customer way stay business, reasonable competitive without adding extra cost bottom line. Customers *feel* like dont *have* tip would gripe added 15% felt still getting good value meal decent service think us expect normal sit restaurant.

Also, percentage goes server imo. Bussers, kitchen staff already tied higher hourly salary rate restaurants, bussers *may* tipped server wants expected. bussers making minimum wage interact guest often. Kitchen staff never get tipped unless server feels like it. stance within scenario. start chopping 15% fee smaller percentages server guys going make whole lot. Selling $1,000 night good shift one server normal priced place. Thats $100 great dinner shift imo. take $70-$80 gonna enough good serving staff. true, best news hearing along time! copied response another redditor, since thought might find interesting:

Early March, symptoms. mostly recovered 3 - 4 weeks, still suffering shortness breath strong waves fatigue daily.

Currently, fatigue bit better, still get shortness breath every day. yeah, need rest before. sense smell 25% used be. much make difference, call it!

But know, COVID-19 spreading fast India. Almost half cases even tested hence go unreported! Oh really? That's actually half bad then. Beats $2000 CDN month. reason negative attributes given women. Unfortunately people like live ignorance popular opinion changes, change can‚Äôt think yourself. morbid way interesting see happens death rates next couple weeks. Deaths unfortunately likely rise extent pivotal everyone handles pandemic going forward.

Either harsh reminder widespread disease capable high fatality numbers, we‚Äôll see much better medical system gotten treating disease widespread infection doesn‚Äôt necessarily produce widespread death it‚Äôs confined younger population. People buying toilet paper town. LA resident, continuously shocked drive past restaurants. Plus visiting family (we isolation separately) San Bernardino county recently suburbs it‚Äôs fairly common see people shopping without masks on. It‚Äôs pretty sad, people stopped caring virus even situation worsens. Go it, help I'll glad to. Yes im expert agree theres good chance death rates dont increase. hope best. Im someone thinks deaths skyrocket people passionate cases shouldnt 40,000 day stage. Yeah that‚Äôs bad combo especially feeding paranoia. I‚Äôve experiencing lately got tooth pulled recently throat hurting coughing lot mucus could mouth trauma. work restaurant interact ton people constantly I‚Äôm hoping since I‚Äôm young hopefully strong immune system I‚Äôll fight get (if hasn‚Äôt happened already) goes show shitty salesman Trump is. literally fails everything does. Early March, symptoms. mostly recovered 3 - 4 weeks, still suffering shortness breath strong waves fatigue daily.

Currently, fatigue bit better, still get shortness breath every day. yeah, need rest before. sense smell 25% used be. Bingo. Also focused trying paint 14% muslim minority deliberately spreading virus. mentality sounds like Trump. Make 50% 4th July Events know one guy, got cardiovascular disease didn‚Äôt know it. went family party dead. unreal. barely leave bed

Because get easily tired energy body physically hurt?

May ask CFS symptoms manifest you? 

Thank advance! mean there's vaccine? That's pretty big ""it's over"" moment no? Glad guys cases, take care well :) Get tested. topic he's working years now. Sorry loop. Also, sorry people make conspiracy theories man trying better world healthcare. Come beaches, stay emergency rooms. can't believe U guys still talking Rights, 10 million infected! Right people (and children) need food every single day rent due end month, every month. wait ineffective Congress (with GOP senate) figures something manages pass laws fundemantally restructures economy? then, going feed children? going protect eviction? C'mon, that's realistic feel empathy people situations I'm even American. *no* options push reopening company work moment. Much much more. total psychos..imagine trump steroids, backed caste system feudal power KKK ruling party I've lived both.. Virginia at. Per capita, China 3x USA. Also US death rate lot people still found. hell wrong you? asthma also think I‚Äôm paranoid bad. oh ok makes sense I‚Äôm really convinced spike stupidity seeing highly correlated access social media internet connectivity.

People always stupid, average, tended realise know enough ‚Äòhave opinion‚Äô technical scientific topics. 

Now many countries seeing crazy wave anti-intellectualism support whatsapp chains utter bullshit, twitter facebook memes lot similar garbage basis reality

I wonder people slum actually spend time surviving less affected still minimum respect scientific expertise. would make huge difference India seen constant exponential growth cases, beginning.

Modi says success.

You need read understanding. Dude. Stop sticking dick crazy r/theydidthemath every country, yours? aren‚Äôt envious pointing reckless behavior makes shit spread. Yes people jealous churchgoers stupid paint damn nails üôÑ Nothing. donation. save life, make buck. results representative, tests done material people came contact health system.

This true. serological surveys try find people ransom, phone book example, like one would ask people US dying countries.

65,000 people died UK. grandmother wear mask isolate home? ‚ÄúI care human deaths. wanna go Starbucks.‚Äù immune compromised paranoid think? 7 billion people
 Barely fraction. sure hope it‚Äôs sitting Yangtze River Difficult find baby-friendly restaurants days. test positive rate Texas Florida awful. Hope you‚Äôre talking US? majority cases deaths hidden falsely reported Don‚Äôt get stuck food service, even take pay cut work shit job get out. Serving like black hole ‚Äúthis pays good enough *right now* I‚Äôll get better job soon‚Äù ‚Äúright now‚Äù never ends industry. 

You‚Äôre entire world wrapped server-life. You‚Äôll start socializing excluding servers, who‚Äôll talk like they‚Äôre making big bucks night made $30 normal. They‚Äôll convince spend another $50 bar *again*. 

It‚Äôs vicious cycle tricking thinking making good enough money. see cash come every day think you‚Äôre making really are, really be. it‚Äôs bad day always tell ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick shift,‚Äù thinking money work extra hard. It‚Äôs not. You‚Äôll get stuck next thing know late 20‚Äôs 30‚Äôs experience skills waiting tables. You‚Äôll glorify experience server act it‚Äôs really hard job teaches lot pushes you, career sense servers think does. company gives fuck work double break Mother‚Äôs Day expo‚Äôing running food everyone else keeping section pre-bussed. hiring manager cares, shit assistant manager GM doesn‚Äôt even care new shift begins. 

Keep ass industry costs. I‚Äôm currently living Arizona uni it‚Äôs frustrating unconcerned many seem be. grocery shopping today take detour around MUSIC FESTIVAL happening downtown crowd weren‚Äôt even wearing masks *Recorded* coronavirus cases reach 10 million soon saw rolled eyes. even close real, it‚Äôd White House, church Phoenix, Arizona. imagine superlatives Trump would batter us with? 

‚ÄúThe best. Nobody‚Äôs ever seen anything like it. It‚Äôs incredible. Unlike anything anybody‚Äôs ever seen.‚Äù Oh I‚Äôm sorry, meant Venice California. Thought CoronavirusCA subreddit! APOCALYPSE INCOMING!!!!

I wonder understand difference number cases test positive rate. saw exact kinds charts March. 

But SURE going happen time. mean, look charts! like last month's charts, time SURE!!! infected tonsils check 3 weeks symptoms fever persistent dry cough. involuntary cough 6 months afterwards, must damaged something throat. can't imagine damage corona lungs lung term already happens simple bacterial infection! Lockdown shit planning..poor execution malafide intent center use muslim bashing opportunity... Fkked think US lower minum wage tipped workers? That's true Europe. time Siege Cosplayers show goods win year kids. one yr old older I‚Äôd think montisori approach. Teach life skills explore nature, build little things. kids year two behind next school year. necessarily true. proof tests done categories people.

Example: back limited capacity testing mostly people symptoms. Hence high(er) percentage.

Now tests done ""random"" manner. People without symptoms also get tested want to. 

This certainly change positive percentages.

I saying hypothesis absolute truth. likewise way proving ""sample size"" makeup. Yep already am. simple Google search would returned lot sources 
But here, allow post local yakima I'll call bullshit you.

If going come hard, research spill assumptions like that. still less Nazi's US. go:

1. Testing capacity US increased - fair say report 30000 cases week 30000 cases early April. 
2. percent positive rate rising. rising fast hotspot states like Florida Arizona, it;s amazingly low New York (1 percent) nice graphical representation check out.
3. general always narrative say COVID cases, hospitalizations, deaths counted, nearly data points cases deaths counted.
4. Arizona hospitalizations found - 

IMHO uptick south caused factors

1. opened without sufficient mask adoption, testing, tracing place
2. opened risky businesses first
3. Nice weather (70's - 80's F) bought time April early May, hot weather (high 80's - 90's +) sent people indoors restaurants, bars gyms. 
4. protests might contributed well, haven;t seen increase Northern cities yet. outside still seems make huge difference, get third dimension air circulation. crazy protests/riots lots people wore masks. probably need wait 2-3 weeks watch Northern cities declare victory. One biggest misses lockdowns anything many states bother prep possible surge. Like half point increase things like hospital capacity, testing capacity, PPE vent production? states sit ass 2 months? flew China Thailand January 16th stayed 2 months, going onward Malaysia. places visited said suffering lack Chinese tourists, one hotel takes group bookings China 360 rooms 4 taken. certainly remember seeing groups Chinese tourists, met Chinese hotel owners. say true, that‚Äôs actually pretty good news herd immunity hit pretty soon rate fucking go lung specialist get checked. Ok usa Vermont actually better CT RI, lower numbers per capita around. can‚Äôt technically say numbers cases going down, actually doubling cases days ago. ~4 addional cases per day, 8 addional cases per day like past Wednesday.

Yes, we‚Äôre rural small here, anecdotally everyone I‚Äôve seen pretty much around wearing mask weeks now. Either misdiagnosed first person turn MS around. MS destroys myelin sheathing around nerve pathways. regrowing it. Theres meds slow decline Ive never heard anyone turning around. Given liability issues, US litigious, surprised business would anything would seen increasing risk public. Depends. decide go super crowded beach, use restrooms, go shopping boardwalks, go beach bar and/or meet friends without masks/social distancing... well, would increase chances.   
   
If drive around find area beach isn‚Äôt crowded skip bars enclosed areas, would probably fine. mean. would believe something different what's reported. would choosing person news sources. smart way.

You might want argue little known risk may much higher anticipated since scientists still unsure. got rona hear nothing jealousy sentence? Ya large demographic people mentality of, ""fuck science"". odd though, even American truly understand logic ignoring it. Yea doubt it‚Äôs actually enough make living even Europe idk Heart disease totally preventable Really? know source every single confirmed case, 20,000 yesterday?

I'm skeptical. expect cops Republicans drink HOME?? Nah man need place drive drunk go home beat spouse. ACAB. way know wait. surge begun. Death lags cases least weeks. Remember back March everyone saying bad, many dead. April along death toll skyrocketed?

Herd immunity near impossible. R0 high. R0 5.7, 83 percent population needs immune. know long immunity lasts. antibodies drop fast. mean immunity, make clear know. Here's paper CDC: complete picture asymptomatic infections either. best estimate around 10% population infected far, though depends area. NYC LA probably higher percentage.

In short, take risks. Distance, wear mask wash hands. Simple. encourage everyone know might avoid another lockdown. Fail we're going lose many people much worse economy. UK test blood donations, symptoms offer donate plasma, involves testing first.

And know it, donate plasma anyway! GDPR place 2 years already now. point local news websites still available Europe probably given becoming compliant kept message since then. Finally something thats well thought root cause versus ""Republicans dumb"". 

Agree exactly saying think continues get worse. I‚Äôm Houston..they keep saying safe August 13th!!!! flat said none going back. freaking way. getting text messages saying ‚Äúcode red, stay home, virus spreading uncontrollable rate hospitals capacity‚Äù. worries 5 weeks completely safe children....üôÑ Meanwhile Vietnam 300 cases total looks like actually working paper., peer reviewed. Here's quote second page:

""NBER working papers circulated discussion comment purposes. peer-reviewed subject review NBER Board Directors accompanies official NBER publications"" hotels simply don‚Äôt infrastructure managing serious cases like COVID (ventilators etc) require. d3? article starting circulate around corner social media I'm trying make sure worst information gets refuted best information. So, come reddit get help. 

That‚Äôs waste time.

People circulate junk like tells something already want believe.

They‚Äôre going care ‚Äúrefutations‚Äù. exactly I've afraid beginning. 

Can appreciate HIV starts flu like symptoms... Dude must secret trillionaire. Go uline order half face mask p95 p100 filters. deliver super fast. stock usually pop back regularly even stated they'll next month. charge receive test blood plethora diseases. go plasma center, manufacture plasma drugs, basically. make profit you. kind plasma given directly another person. lockdown, plenty people Fuck off. Weird...I remember people calling ‚Äúairborne AIDS‚Äù mainstream subs months back. Wasn‚Äôt meme either, fully anyway. seemed pretty adamant virus HIV similarities research kinda wild see Make sure internships prior graduating. help significantly go first full time role.


Also, contribute open source projects / make own. Hah no. Barely made end second. Thing low prevalence virus things become safer aren‚Äôt many cases. western europe girus doesn‚Äôt spread uncontrollably right unlike US example.

And small spikes see countries react. think response germany recent T√∂nnies outbreak bit late, bu5 might still work out. Still much better US doing, guess similarly strict would habe lock country  See US. smart. even 3 weeks now? happens well. saying it‚Äôs possible protestors got COVID numbers didn‚Äôt spike non protestors staying social distancing almost evened numbers. meant deterant keep people traveling states first place. someone knows get sick lose income would think would choose stay home. sure work guess try something. possible. also flat-earther, chemtrails, believes 5g thing... can't. can't. Gives every indication kind, probably better person ways though I'm trying best person honor someone died decade ago miss every single day, easily better butt me, still... sometimes simplest answer easiest one, okay lean way. I'm pretty sure dinosaur hide fossils, example, can't faked. say nothing blood samples eggs.

Yo, kind relationship roomate?

How butt jealousy relevant lol I‚Äôm sick tired sick tired! According Bryan Alvarez, couple fans test positive. Better find cave hide six months I'm negative üò≠ hoping asymptomatic, luck. isolate two weeks around many people since tuesday probably need tested develop symptoms friend birthday party today, happily declined. 
Two friends went beach 2 days ago. miss friends man, don‚Äôt get people ignoring this. Yep. 

Some local companies also realized tech companies stupid started follow suit. wife's much smaller company switched WFH second third tech giant announced WFH plans. Taiwan also agressive contact tracing surveillance system best described police state. like people Taiwan know it, accept it, strategy controlling Taiwan possible many places.  someone thats 20, message scared me. Hey morons... understood thanks thinking we‚Äôre even dumber you.. Article states 100 billion South Korean won, 831,000 USD. probably people following rules pissed venting, sucks read see people know social media acting like nothing going unfortunate people then. They'll simply deal it. Oof know supposed condemn reckless behavior, taking care two high needs people stressful. mean mostly old die sick would world end? man power young minds still alive well part even means licking high risk inside I've Houston week (out control) hand sanitizers left smell like cheap tequila. Covid shit going manufacturing behind scenes? Texas: nothing' steers, queers...and covid amongst ur peers could known. /s Apparently multitude people, quite actually rocket science. magic. Still questionable intelligence. news release, Tyson said tested 1,142 employees June 17 June 19, 291 tested positive COVID-19. 

It's fucking insane much virus spreads meat plant company said already several protective measures place the¬†Noel facility, like¬†screening¬†its employees symptoms every shift, requiring¬†masks instilling variety social distancing measures. 

This tells 'protective measures' mean shit virus. false safety reassurance. people agree narrative bots? ""built accordance biosafety GMP standards"". Good luck following biosafety standards. people starting get tired behave like toddler, argue like someone high school, post like unemployed internet warrior? taxes going huge problem. July taxes due 2019 half taxes 2020 also due. people looking 1 1/2 years tax due once. Western Australia isn‚Äôt country worst part they‚Äôll take people them. It‚Äôs coincidence lot people nursing homes dying this. got families visiting them. gave us lame Justin kept good one. ü•∫ People living lives. Nothing wrong that. Spain one biggest countries EU lol making assumptions Americans realize, US can't get grip pandemic, could result travel ban Americans want travel abroad. People still dangerously fixated belief vaccine found. There's guarantee happen all. That's actually evolution works. deadly virus less spread less successful be. Natural selection selects weaker viruses spread readily. never fully recovered. permanent damage bottom right lung lowered breathing capacity 75%-80%. ""W√§ndi Bruine de Bruin, provost professor public policy""

Sounds like boss unreleased Bloodborne DLC. easy see particularly active user. rate post things specifically attacking Sweden means probably either profit either monetarily politically genuine mental health issues ended fixating Sweden fashion. must spend hlurs every day researching Sweden.  therapist work exact dialysis now. overwright hypothyroidism covid. can't leave bed work outside home now. Sad. Irish never recovered potato famine would people thought others would recover tell mom, religion trick devil test human stupidity. :D I‚Äôve lost hope. thing ending depends us working together get sort vaccine available. 

P.s. hindsight 2020 right along! hope get ACA overturned supreme court. we're already everything wrong, let's go ahead make bad possible. Maybe large amount support single payer healthcare, join rest developed world takes care citizens. Many Europeans enough vacation days year that. Coronavirus outbreaks gone 3x U.K. allowing kids go back school. aren‚Äôt even close kids back school, PM decided mandate masks, he‚Äôs planning get rid social distancing order kids go back September. vulnerable parent, happy handled all. Care elaborate? I'm NE surprised well CT responded Covid. say self-quarantined. There's difference. wish could, I'm 2.5 year monogamous relationship another guy. Yes. thing happened Bali. chinese tourists all, borders closed them, leave China. find hard believe unsafe touch door handle someone else touched perfectly fine touch food grocery store someone could grabbed put back coughed over. perfectly safe eat burger restaurant someone could coughed over. 

I also hard time believing even telling truth things lied masks somehow working doctors use started. downplaying transmissability virus worried economic impact people worried eating restaurants?

We've lied misled much trust anything telling us anymore. Yea issues. Sorry that. throw trough can't get of. Would keep rest us safe them. less six months start pandemic, seem studies cases patients moderate mild symptoms three months. anyone know paper this? behavior sense disease point to, virus still present body immunological sequelae, example inflammatory nature? Pretty much. We've drunk driving laws books 100 years. Everyone knows selfish thing puts lots people risk. 

Still kills 10k people per year.

If sudden DUI laws liability erased, we'd find analogous position pandemic responsibility. ""won't prevent return"". man never speaks clearly.

What mean? following herd immunity? Well say transparent. complain swedes banned less everywhere.

Is aware might long term immunity warning countries?
Then perfect.. thank warning. already working premises. advice keep yourself. understand amazing reasoning. care. look numbers resulting strategy, numbers awful, advice useless. Nobody cares.

Have nice day. players might fine, 60 70 year old coaches... like don‚Äôt wear masks bullshit want us go shopping worry cause why... fucking Christ stop lying!!! may terrible experiment future generations‚Äô benefit only. true. LT Governor wanted sacrifice grandmas. Mission accomplished!  Lol, dont give shit think me. hilarious stalking me. must *lots* friends family care you. 

üòÇ Thank God Mississippi Karen much. government won‚Äôt mandate, wrong people advocating? Let‚Äôs downvote Karen trying help situation. Makes sense. üôÑ know something wrong can't understand finally gathered courage confide loved ones it, met dismissals.


This exactly happened son, autism. suspected something quite right since infant, around 20 months old, gathered courage tell parents thought something wrong. basically shrugged nothing. mom even said ""well SURE lazy??"", speaking walking yet. 

Then around 6 months later finally diagnosed autism, told parents, mom skeptical actually said ""well, REALLY believe that?!?""...Uhhh yeah. do. :|


As side note, think COVID big deal either, catch they'll fine strong immune systems. read article commenting. maybe johnny come lately's like you, always way~ critical thinking skills require work. Read entire article please. You‚Äôve done twice, give article source argument article doesn‚Äôt support say.

...**The solution issue part quoted. quoted it.**

When read you‚Äôre supposed read whole thing, know it‚Äôs really hard there‚Äôs lot words know it! forgot, lockdown flatten curve, eliminate virus.

You know like grease fire kitchen, fire department comes out, puts fire upset collateral water damage refuse let put smaller fire spread hallway don‚Äôt want anymore water damage, demand leave. minutes later house burns surprise, surprise, even though firefighters flattened curve fires house, fire spreads. 

It would tragedy firefighters, National News media, fire scientists, concerned onlookers hadn‚Äôt screaming you, ‚Äúthe damage done, save house fire water damage won‚Äôt matter, FIRE SPREADS IDIOT!!‚Äù thought exaggerating, scrolled down. how.....how people function? That‚Äôs Texas Friday governor actually something try curb infections. what? lol yes certainly can!! People walking around certainly pass around. fact walmarts stores like IMO worse places go right now. governors look data?

Arizona far surpassed New York cases per million went lockdown. graph made showing this. 

Every day wait setting strict measures make situation worse, inevitably overloading hospitals critically ill patients.  believe can‚Äôt give blood one year visiting Dominican Republic. anyone know still true? won‚Äôt South, half Reddit seems think something dramatically improved treatment, seems unclear me.

Not treatment (although help). Continued lockdowns vulnerable populations important. CDC reported 8 10 COVID-19 deaths adults 65+. death toll would closer 25k places like nursing homes locked late February/early March. quick search shows people could post-polio symptoms show 15-40 years infection. That's wild, risk I'm willing take prevent it! Unless harmons Costco, masks Face shields don‚Äôt protect us tiny aerosolized droplets float around poorly ventilated room though... protect eyes sneezes such, that‚Äôs it. Medical professionals wear *in addition to* masks. meant concern infection thermometer itself. walked away let administer myself, would different. need right face, let wear mask, use head thermometer. wear shield. literally cost $2. Yet another bullshit headline fox.

If true would never seen many grocery workers picking covid 70 percent report attend church services regularly shit.

Of course, ""Last month wore mask went Costco"" loophole technically ""some time"", worn one since. 

Not buying one second. idea overkill isn't? I'm taking one step more. 

The mask mandate need enforced criminal offense. outside dwelling without mask, mandatory sentence year prison order. way stop spread put boot proverbial throat. mean people got infected every day got test results every day? Lockdowns don‚Äôt sustainable, nobody governing position pushing long term solution. Lockdowns get cases control rely testing contact tracing manage outbreak. Lately I've getting news Onion. accurate, time... Worlds worst headline. dumb duck going read say masks aren‚Äôt needed grocery stores now. Best Upvote back Upvote think would fair assume responses evenly distributed. know cases emergency, void temporarily permanently patents, right?

We done World War II. people never believed healthcare human right, system trash. Lack PPE staff miss use PPE played big role spread. 

Initial spread also really came ‚Äúearly days‚Äù covid testing available knew prevalent asymptomatic cases were.

Catching contact tracing hard us I‚Äôm sure homes.

It‚Äôs opinion THATs high death spread rates came from. got contact tracing place nailed PPE use, spreading really mostly stopped. Nice. sick leave people come work sick, smart. üëå holy mother god subreddit trash fire tell woman blood dirty anymore:

""I trans woman, eligible donate assigned sex birth male, sex man. donate blood?

Individuals identify female sex man, may eligible donate blood, other¬†blood donation eligibility¬†criteria applicable.""

I've never tried give blood gay old enough eligible. I'm seriously considering lying point telling I'm straight. There's even shred scientific consistency anymore. people drawing early withdrawn preprint claimed find sequence matches HIV, [comments Luc saying thing. mainstream idea enough fringe support going away.

The crazy thing fear AIDS drilled minds people overlook HIV extremely slow acting drugs control it. definitely true Alabama. see 20% wear masks, usually like 10%. guy posted thread demonstrate give shit kids health conditions. Also really likes rag fat kids. thing: trying figure help them, one ever said weren‚Äôt. think implication made due recent introduction virus, simply minimal done point. think cultures individualistic, country born included (the Netherlands). Yea know claims still anecdotal point. stressful sucks. hope feel better soon. I‚Äôve saying covid isn‚Äôt flu - spiritual hell spawn polio measles. that‚Äôs you‚Äôre kink, don‚Äôt let you‚Äôre gods FOX treat like shit. 

Anyway I‚Äôm done you, you‚Äôre alt right troll. least respected point view, even though it‚Äôs stupid... deleted true shitty comments. Fucking pathetic. I'm really sure trying say, whatever helping karma. mean happened /r/nyc Wow. must hard friends someone like that. would way except sure viral material spit test.

Sorry: Sticking nose swab, 'gold standard'.  According tracing, reopening bars huge culprit. I‚Äôm guessing LA VA clinic pretty packed isn‚Äôt already.

But wouldn‚Äôt able get care I‚Äôm sure aren‚Äôt veterans would effective. article says. headline generalizes ""can't get grocery store!"" really need discuss 500k Deaths world wide already crazy comparision illness run country / world wide ?

Dont try downplay deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean USA got **127,495** Deaths.

Just read Timeline 1918 pandemic 

Now dont forget EXTREMELY primitive ( vs modern ) medical times.

3 full years pandemic = 675k Deaths.

they vaccines.

and Modern medical abilitys.

&amp;#x200B;

Doesnt sound far Covid 19 1917 would spread / reigned even more. worried thing going tongue.

Yet said skip it. two statements contradict other. SHC014 found nature designated complete form?  Yes think videos I‚Äôve seen quite weren‚Äôt wearing mask all. There‚Äôs way it‚Äôs spreading. Yes. course. Funnily enough they‚Äôve already replaced talking Florida hit massive wave like New York northeastern states pandemic first started 

Too many people forget many parts Sun Belt see surge like northeastern states March/April *precisely* locked down. Sun Belt states locked earlier, sense virus spreading widely community March, unlike places NJ, NY, lockdown mid-to-late-March already late. believe conservatives thinks ccp completely full shit communist dictatorship. know plenty diehard dems know Chinese communist party lying virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre around people. 

That said, need go grocery store, please do. take proper precautions minimize risk. Don‚Äôt sacrifice nutrition. fucking rocket science.

No, plain old regular science. course ignore, dislike, distrust, willfully abandon prefer opinions, faith, ignorance. think going public? working class? It‚Äôs what, rich people, upper class?

Don‚Äôt naive going public political classist. Lots people going out. Lots people aren‚Äôt. Serum Institute Pune , India . Weve already manufactured 30 million doses potential candidates scale winner phase 3 results come july end . Potentially 25 million vaccine vials roll sept end unless trials total failure . judging phase 1 2 went , theres small chance  American labor produces much better product outsourcing India. Bit honest Florida never recovered corporations need athletes 100% fight war. 

No corporations responsible life long healthcare needs employees.

Few corporations guild based like military. military can‚Äôt recruit senior enlisted members civilian sector, start blank slate build talent decade. need healthy blank slates.

There exemptions medicine, nursing, law, officer positions, one counts band even though get get rank based experience. Sure, whatever say. people rather live created reality... Unfortunately that's also going get killed mostly okay beginning April. actual illness fine. Like hard flu. It‚Äôs effects sucked üòÇ understand that‚Äôs I‚Äôm asking JESUS DUDE LOCKDOWNS DON‚ÄôT SUSTAINABLE THEY‚ÄôRE LONG TERM SOLUTION, THEY‚ÄôRE USED GET CASES CONTROL REOPEN STRONG TESTING CONTACT TRACING literally brought naval ships built hospitals overflow never happened. ‚Äúwhat could done‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt extend Cuomo doesn‚Äôt extend Trump. Failure top, full stop. experience, think overreacting little. initial reaction protests harsh criticism protesters ignoring covid concerns. expressed politics sub quite left-leaning, direct terms. got downvotes, sure - one accused racism, far remember. fairly prolific expressing views.

Since then, criticism grown muted since appear protests major vector transmission. that's true beaches well - although side-activities outing may dangerous, beach pretty safe. want like me. want take precautions protect family. I‚Äôve seen videos, lots people unmasked definitely social distancing. research pandering left cause outrage. It‚Äôs bad science heard argument well interaction work. stood stared flabbergasted, trying wrap head around logic that. silent, concerned stare made pretty uncomfortable lol... maybe I‚Äôll instead trying use logic. I'm A-

I think need study further. I'm support groups long term cases, lots type people hit hard, too.

A family member mine, also type A, multiple risk factors, really mild case. There's much know yet.

I assume certain doom based blood type. really airlines care - customers. Try telling someone flight full flight fully booked customer see open seats app. 

There's win situation there. customer demands go. Legally airline accommodate. Someone gets mad. customer plane wants space customer denied boarding onto flight space. 

Either way, customer whips cell phone there's tweet YouTube video poof... airline enemy. trolling reactions actually stone-cold stupid? airborne, deadly, highly contagious disease something honestly consider typical risk? one players online D&amp;D group I'm Texas, spent saturday keeping us updated adventure get tested Covid works children may exposed.

It took 6 hours get process. Nah he's stringing together random biology related words. US deaths per capita significantly lower UK, Spain Italy. common cold form one three species rhinovirus mutated 160 different human three species rhinovirus (A, B, C) include around 160 recognized types human rhinovirus differ according surface proteins (serotypes).

The reality common cold subset coronaviruses, challenges finding vaccine identical, identical mutation issues. people!!!??? hometown. don‚Äôt get either. old high school packed elbow way hallways classes get next class. don‚Äôt even think masks hand sanitizer help. Well actually use work. highly doubt really practicing measures. People lie. Like lot. isn‚Äôt US government making various vaccines, it‚Äôs Oxford University, Imperial College London, University Pittsburg, well drug companies Astra Zeneca, GSK, Sanofi researchers around world.

The entire medical community world wide looking safety vaccines, many trials happening now. faith serious side effects widely reported safest vaccine come fore. 

If want diligent, don‚Äôt take government rags say trust, read vaccine research scientific press/journals. sort environment first superspreading event Wuhan seafood market happened, also recent flare-up Beijing. Auto mod removing response giving reasons, guess can‚Äôt reply. Pretty annoying. see comment history. Guess number 1 thru 9 know. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand many people going Myrtle Beach, Clearwater Beach, Daytona, etc. UK seemed work haven‚Äôt heard worked not. We‚Äôre set situation. Teachers going casualties shouldn‚Äôt happen. Humans get exposed pathogens die, knew? worn mask last year times. Everyone wear mask rest life. saves lives right? wear hazmat suits public, saves lives right?  even school tge winter low humidity months right? hypocrite. think 250k lives worthy mask, 50K lives lost worthy. want risk someones life future wearing mask rest life? selfish. blind many exposures already have. H1n1 hit 60 million 365 days. probably 15-20 milliin already. Go get hazmat suit get lifetime masks yourself. Take pills daily. didnt eliminate time? many uncertainties EVERYONE(and hate GENERALIZING) CERTAIN 'its over, noone keep eradicated more!'..sure!!! Great!!! tried would reading sporadic news outskirts getting infections followed swift TTI...
Even animals spreading it, like havent learned much virus since... like would decide MASS migration amazon... containment possible! didnt take every possible measure? think know anawer.. damn horrible imagine Guaranteed we'll never see another dime.  Coronavirus affecting people differently. would able predict exaclty much funding would needed?? people get mild symptoms go comas. yeah, print money keep hospitals going under. call police, get scum arrested Make Karen's feel better C constant, assuming P != NP sets certain boundaries existence. you‚Äôre comment history shows sparky. Yeah people sick coronavirus shouldn‚Äôt go back nursing homes. trying equate elderly people nursing homes everyone, pretty stupid. People nursing homes nurses jump person person things like bathing them, spreads virus. people sit inside contact people. need doctor order test you? blood draw, doctor's clinic LabCorp facility? Yes, would make sense. 

Some people claiming increases positives South young, lower death rates reflecting this. treatment side things may improved.

Hard say infection rates young early since weren‚Äôt tested. able test extremely sick early really limited understanding. sorry experiencing me. truly awful one quite understands all. doctors tell nothing treat it, treat symptoms. 32 years old living since 12, diagnosed 6 years ago. Many doctors shrugged acted attention seeker, especially young. wish people would take viruses serious general rather pretending can't sort damage.

I'm sure FB user, CEBV support groups. refreshing know alone world treats someone looking attention. Nope. want able work, take care daughter without pain fatigue exertion. added edit above. really specific, recent solution. one best friend family member allowed visit, provide snack conversation occurs seated outside. eating especially mask wearing becomes bizarre. fragile ego petulant child. Hopefully therapies reduce effects vaccine. roll time vaccine take long time even everyone trusted immediately. logistics producing administrating 100s millions people another miracle. all. White Americans. Trump Americans.

My Black people take responsibility this.  lives poor people small price pay making sure rich people make money.
 


/s  Awesome!! Okay, ""novel cold."" Nice work. Amazing half million people die every six months cold. Crazy. mean that: crazy. Really feel way live. hope Europe ‚Äúopens‚Äù responsibly done start respread too. can‚Äôt blame them. That's common argument, Diamond Princess immunity testing bear out. See?

GOOD. mom works casino elsewhere owned vegas based company (though see customers) wanting change conditions work. face face homeschool label distance. Temperature scans allowed enter building everyone including patients wore mask. Also, keeping patients least 6 ft away other. wiping everything people. went early morning, many people felt safe enough. know lot blood banks also implementing antibody tests, research see go another place donate get tested.

Nobody blame imo. what's happening plain see schools kids basically superspreaders thing. ... fair point.


But like super duper broke **know** anyone gone one year post-covid. 

If believe SARS2 single spillover event humans, hit perfectly one shot, may right. 

Many people believe that. I'm one them. think much likely SARS2, close ancestor, jumping back forth humans isolated communities quite while. 

I bet another year passes, human history virus known least three years back. Glass half full there!! 404 Found weird America people wearing masks store yet many infections. Netherlands seen mask store 25 people intensive care 1500.

I think wearing masks store biggest problem know biggest spreader statistical theory principal referring says ‚Äúless 2x difference strong evidence‚Äù? Like said, care well-being obviously see CCP better choice. think sarcastic Gen X often forgotten about. right, youngest millennials mid- 20s. Ah okay. remember reading bottleneck due long manufacturing process (6-8 months). Texas. Don‚Äôt forget rural Texas. 

*sobs* hmmmm invested HIV research early on...... I, too, would like know reasoning given people refuse wear masks USA try help stop spread virus killed lot people. I'm still willing bet good summary responses would people fuckwits. Family members mine (who‚Äôve following guidelines luckily sick,) suddenly thrown towel July 4 party town. I‚Äôm begging realize mistake, others... imagine similar story everywhere. purpose eventually everyone wearing niqab, duh
/s Oh, fuck, 'rona! Chinese virus bio-engineered? find lot people know exists. great, free resource. Maybe post places let people know. (Don't blame financee, surprised LA would spend money something like this.) Especially noon That‚Äôs COVID test isn‚Äôt üòÇ jobs listed aren‚Äôt responsible rooms full children. guy deserves massive kick teeth Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations 3% (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients 1%. (Overall ICU bed usage stayed 87%). Ventilators use COVID shot considerably, nearly 10% (all time 

Very sustainable trend, nothing like increasing hospitalization count 20% every week. Switch numbers makes sense. Maybe controversial opinion, feel ""winning war"" virus like this, there's vaccine. Sure, get numbers officially zero New Zealand, always return one way another. Remember people flipping shit China lying hiding data fabricating data? Yeah... Where's outrage people now? highest government officials losing minds twitter disgrace? airplanes HEPA filtration systems. protests people got tested attending could quarantine infected spread disease.

Thinking everyone even people protesting responsibly keeping distance washing properly fantasy telling yourself. match observation. Im Missouri, picked pizza Friday. person place mask. disagree white supremacist

You're best $2,000,000,000,000,000,000 can‚Äôt stop would love able die hill sound nice please stop replying can‚Äôt stop going need - less - teachers. Man feel fortunate living do. think I've seen one unmasked person outdoors weeks, runners cyclists keeping waaaaaay away people (they've shut city streets make kind space them).

How freaking hard this? Like, I'm asshole want risk getting sick I've infected know yet. Besides, get wear bandit bandana goes really well finger gun thing. add AZ data:

[Disclaimer  assumption virus changed much terms many cases become critically ill. 

When adjust cases per day population, see relative case growth states.

New York, reaching \~220 cases per million per day (or 4500 cases per day total) got complete lockdown. effect lockdown: 2 weeks cases started fall again. One important point increase, NY high test positivity rate Meaning still lot infections going radar.

3 weeks locking down, NY's hospitalizations peaked NY locked number 2,600. dramatic increase.

Now situation AZ: cases rising cases per million capita), test positivity rates 20%. past level cases per million capita NY started lockdown. Hospitalizations going up. 

There however lockdown strict measures place. means virus still spreading.

My theory following path NY took, hospitalizations go dramatically coming weeks AZ. every action take now, see effect 2-3 weeks.

I hope I'm wrong, hard see surge cases somehow magically turn around. leaning trusting numbers degree - husband every week work (in Northern Italy less) friends there. Even maybe testing lot whatever reason, there's palatable difference March - lot people worked sick, doctors exhausted people knew saw people white hazmat suits going get sick (or worse) person building.  people know Italy feeling sighs relief seemed worst it. 

Not mention stringent mask wearing (compared places)

Aside that, fake fudge positive testing numbers simply testing. Generally can't hide dead bodies. small degree, there's big outbreak. public tends notice there's cold storage containers sitting outside emergency rooms. Opening businesses enforcing preventative measures long run isn‚Äôt Swedish plan. It‚Äôs peoples plans. difference short term That‚Äôs saw. maybe many unmasked &amp; shouting. like natural selection grandma Definitely one least safest (even pre covid19) think world relief agencies provide women/girls schooling training, get traps. account may old enough, sure lol Yeah learn wave, must repeat panic happened first weeks outbreak. social distance, masks, level heads help us get this. Seems like America wants learn hard way, done. Keep heads up! many times need read articles like , 18 customers 7 staff got Texas bar realize bars social situations design (i.e. grouping, interacting, talking loudly music) inherently dangerous.

These headlines getting redundant ""Florida/Texas set new daily case records). Seems like Madagascar right along Buried? That's fair question. example, people starting continue claim coronavirus high risk causing long term effects, yet one single study  like that's anything proud of. really know numbers comparable, since limited tests could give likely symptom holders. two clients school teachers. say zero chance school outbreaks dont happen place. guidelines put place nearly impossible logistically deal with. Every single day post outbreak alert? classify +11 case increase ‚Äúsurge‚Äù? Right... incredibly silly, savvy employers basically acknowledge situation strange, intentionally lay employees, followed work whatever number hours can/want work - example, state, making $370 unemployment (the maximum, including benefits like federal stimulus), earn $540 lose benefits entirely.

Granted $15/hr employees probably make full $370/week, let's assume do: return working reduced 30 hour week, get a) unemployment + $600/week b) job stimulus ends. North Carolina. Teachers aren‚Äôt allowed unionize. Yeah lots people also need labotomies. state someone say ""if die die""? deaths piled high! Rushing implies level unethical speed. moving fast following proper procedures. haven‚Äôt heard read experts saying otherwise. saying sick people right go back live live?

What kind fucking stupid logic this? reality is: people assisted living homes, shipped hospital, hospitals kicked ***because sick, much danger virus.*** I've got news you, problem people send elders assisted living soon they're mild fucking burden. ***THAT*** problem. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple, folks. flip bar graph vertical axis, we‚Äôve flattened curve! outbreak?‚Äù
-G P Logic think state state basis. state country basically. example NY/NJ cases low like Europe taking proper precautions. winning much, people getting tired winning die PEOPLE PROBABLY PRINT OUT.

IRONICALLY IRONIC. I‚Äôm even arguing you. You‚Äôre emotional like child. one listen gain little maturity. sense humour, Yanks.

Sorry; make 'humor'. ? week, test positivity rate 14%

For context purposes, 4.27% May. increased positivity rates, hospitalizations upcoming holiday, we're rough mean believe China‚Äôs number that‚Äôs dumb people America thinking it‚Äôs fake. China hasn‚Äôt reported 500 cases day since feb 29 days since 100 cases, meanwhile reports urns thousands brought funeral homes. much China said misreported deaths raised exactly 50%. IQ changed. still job software engineer. memory issues didnt before. Duh, mainly cuz nano-bots Bill designed lobbied placed vaccine He's unelected. calling anything? think start serious social pressure movement. Ridicule crap people wear masks. like back high school, point insight violence, enough make people wearing masks feel self-conscious want fit in. Fuck Red Cross. Science gods greatest gift mankond, judge us harshly squandering it. 1) Disabilities preclude mask-wearing rare real, states advice medical experts allowed disability exemptions mask orders

2) Fuckwads going attempt abuse exemption taken away, serious harm disabled people.

3) Expecting disabled people stay home easier letting accommodations like exemptions discriminatory long, ugly history.

4) over, please remember generally unacceptable confront disabled person demand explain need wheelchair/handicap parking spot/diaper bag/whatever. 10,000 new cases today. 

So far.  America nutshell.

""I need haircut, essential"" I‚Äôm sad person Oh, okay, running street mobs beating people? Total lawlessness India assume. Yeah stay safe! Indoor bars bad idea. Plain simple. 


Changed excited obnoxious narrow minded .... nice personal attack Mr. Escobar Unfortunately I'm starting think well case, played grab ass entirely long looking like we're late easy solutions. looked get number deaths related influenza occur hospital, use death certificate data estimate likely deaths occur outside hospital. look death certificates **pneumonia influenza causes (P&amp;I), respiratory circulatory causes (R&amp;C), non-respiratory, non-circulatory causes death, deaths related influenza may influenza listed cause death**. use information causes death FluSurv-NET determine mixture P&amp;I, R&amp;C, coded deaths include investigation death certificate data. Finally, estimate proportion influenza-associated deaths occurred outside hospital, estimate deaths-to-hospitalization ratio.

Right there. ‚ÄúBecause deaths related influenza may influenza listed cause death.‚Äù counted flu death even died outside hospital cause death doesn‚Äôt say died flu. Time start working Canadian accent, eh hoser? Lebron James stronger tom Brady. Lebron James cannot throw football 50 yards. Therefore, Tom Brady also cannot throw football 50 yards.

Do see flaw logic? I'm saying lockdowns required used 'flatten curve'. essential number places around world. 

But - given destructive disruptive measures were, hindsight, think many countries would adopted different approach. includes Sweden. 

When final balance counted levels, able see full picture. I‚Äôm suppose go France uni September visa. expect. I‚Äôm American citizen currently states  Bullsh!t. America affords deems ""priorities"". data extremely useful swaying opinions Fox viewers due belief value accurate statistics scientific integrity! educators love teaching. won‚Äôt teach. 

Fire them. Bring real teachers. 

Fuck this. this? Also remember number deaths underreported, surprise there's million dead right know. googled yes did. didn‚Äôt recall Muslims opposed certain countries. Went searching, looks like both. claims ""novel ingredients"" ""limited global availability."" I'm Europe people country think that's Chinese, Japanese etc. username checks Yes chinese mapped outbreak cluster seat positions air flow  lot People need day care part school want kids educated. could keep away media stop inflaming reactionaries would great. critical care nurse designated COVID ICU, echo many physicians statements. I‚Äôve since April disheartening experience. Many days wonder point anymore. Testing didn‚Äôt mean waiting line 8 hours. Nah easiest way get money card create PayPal storefront. Small fee turn cash without pesky cash advance fees I‚Äôm sorry stuck shitshow. /r/darwinawards Thank you. important thing know sure without guessing people get twice severity. screwed. can't someone antibodies suddenly going valuable worker.

My brother lived worked Taiwan years completely normal kids mask married good woman. 

Don‚Äôt let people get you; cause waste energy non beneficial manner. 

Protect yourselves. Right, India population 1.4 billion. know statistic work too. seemed pretty incredulous. also include police, firefighters, grocery clerks, gas station attendants, doctors, nurses, essential workers, people nursing homes cannot ‚Äúgo home‚Äù protect (43 percent COVID deaths nursing homes)? ways ""flatten curve"" campaign successful. bought time develop produce testing, ramp production PPE, form plan- maintaining hospital capacity.

Unfortunately, still top despite reopening. Many areas still overwhelmed need testing. That's they're considering ""pooled testing"" improve test response time.

As capacity testing tracing ramps up, transitioning towards containment strategy. shutdown severely reduce case load test, trace, isolate cases functionally eliminate community transmission.

The point definitely everyone get infection. lot people die. 10,000 Florida. Sunday. 1 pm.

What. The. Fuck. got meanmugged hiking trail WA state. Luckily one idiot sea people wearing masks wear mask whenever enter confined indoor spaces strangers grocery stores, department stores, buses, taxis work. 

I otherwise wear it. ...You aware U.S. government entity that's creating/testing/releasing vaccines, right?? Couldnt tell ya I'm talk things im expert on. 

If someone stupid take seriously fault 60 people got Rona pretty obvious business operating outside bounds health depts re-opening standards

It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that. Sometimes health department standards aren‚Äôt good enough, especially situation like bars. Send juicy spreaders lots places following health guidelines bad times. source 40% bit? Hello stranger! There's way enforced. There's always choice.

It's state, every teacher quit without reason. cities FL/TX/AZ experiencing uptick weird, extremely selfish reaction feel kind relieved think might true, means maybe get vaccinating faster otherwise would. 

I feel bad feeling this. That's messed up. live freaking Greater Houston go grocery shopping minimum 85% people see masked appropriately. include number? Haha that's hilarious üòÇ hospitalized 2 weeks last year sent home PICC line could continue IV antibiotics another 2 weeks. people saying practical idiots easy do.

It sucked, easy. 6,000+ people signing petition remove mask mandate state 10.9 million people, need 5.4 million balance position...

and
""On Friday, Sonia Angell, director California Department Public Health, said thinks protests could ""a contributor"" state's rising cases, said ""is difficult tease exactly.""

furthermore point avoiding asking new cases attended protests dont even data (which think everyone agree stupid unscientific) 

there reason protests less transmissive outdoor gatherings people distance, time mask wearing. believe otherwise simply illogical. American living Europe, **giant sigh relief** Yeah, saw Soros offering $1000 week willing intubated, $5,000 willing die. We're *really committed"" forcing folks wear mask supermarket hate seeing smiles time. totally think deaths worth it. it, loss year, kids losing much school, shut international travel.

They wrong duh spend hours arguing people talk Googled something they're 100% certain set. ‚ÄúIf God wanted fly, would given wings.‚Äù Sounds like makings great class-action lawsuit kinds people absolutely small percentage population. 7% sounds right Americans ignorant. 

As soon see trigger headline, immediately jump conclusions without mentally processing information options. 

Sad country, really. American, expected see awards now, quite entertaining idea protests stopped spread coronavirus research shows zero difference case growth cities big protests compared cities small protests. words, suggestion protests fueling contributing trend noting LA County. That's true. less deaths per capita, cases per capita, that's oft rubbish testing regime. also significantly less tests per capita, significantly daily new deaths (approx. 8 times more), new case rate 30 times higher ours. Chicago surging. Washington state starting surge. 

Arizona reopened place May 8. current surge didn‚Äôt come two weeks ago quite peculiar blood donations gay people permitted fairly homophobic Russia prohibited many countries known decent support LGBT rights. 90% 99.99%. think there‚Äôs lot observation bias play. live downtown Philly see ton people going maskless. reality, it‚Äôs probably 1/5 personally come across, way high, nowhere near casually think happening.  people jump conclusions likely never given blood know questions asked. That's hardly high bar days *""Nobody could seen coming""*  fuck would protests still priority?  NYC. must racist guy.

But hey agree, AMERICA BAD regular excess deaths etc. surprise true numbers double reported. NY NJ also assuming lot positives without test since tests limited treatment positive not. bet people would wear masks watch video patient intubated. NOPE. I'M OUT. even know people put ventilators. honestly fucking think hospitals putting perfectly healthy people vent? honestly think doctors (you know, people school decade job) know ventilating person lasting consequences? Fuck, possibly supposed fight disease level ignorance exists? God. point highly doubt ever even read peer reviewed study let alone understood it. Canada lot right. IMO, healthcare system that's right track (although probably reason many Canadians travel US specialized health care surgeries) education (anyone go school want, matter physically travelling there). grow I'm sure know lot more.

Anyone thinks US 3rd World country understand definition ""3rd World Country"". Put simply means underdeveloped poor country low standard living. US needs work lot things, money problem. policy. may think stupid outdated policies (and may right), still one wealthiest successful countries (high ranking positive metrics) earth. There's reason illegal immigration problem. People want live here. 

I hard time believing covid situation would much different Obama/Bush/Biden/anyone else president. unprecedented time. Canada much much lower population makes situation objectively easier deal with. agree Trump good person would taking heat matter did. shut travel Asian countries, covid still mostly isolated there, early people pissed.

Collecting conspiracy theories hobby people. could people deep mistrust world seek comfort via theories. maybe people love exciting feeling mystical nature conspiracy theories.

You realize ""hobby"" nature. theories necessarily make sense much. feeling people get them. feeling uncovering something mystical. incomplete thought.

Michigan governor tried maintain quarantine barbers kept showing guns harassing government employees. people asked this, exactly top-down decision Urban/suburban/rural, yeah, that's exactly. tbh, maybe one size fits way go. Maybe mask mandates reflect population density. makes sense tell county 137 people mask like county 4M. also claims due young people socializing young people forced back work. guy shame. cost there, ideas regarding reopen anything indoors, schools, offices, restaurants especially, scientists side.

You (and downvoters) find following paper interesting  people believe think they're smarter something? Good them. find hard believe though due dense population vacine available. rancid blob ejaculate governor actively refuses job, systematically undermines ability people job, sure shooting help either. I'm fine defunding police. people area, included, guns, we'd start neighborhood watch groups carry vigilante justice. careful wish for. Youre likely fine, hospitals probably safest public places seriously precautions taken there. father inside major hospital four days late April non-covid related procedure came without issue. Good point, probably better move forgot em feel like missing point. point can't really accuse someone ""not research"" they're actively asking questions.

Criticising *where* ask questions irrelevant, especially they're asking subreddit that's pretty closely tied subject they're asking about. :( know aware situation unfolding Australia right now, well here's quick rundown: states, including NSW, got handle outbreaks. last 10 days, significant (comparing states Australia, *not* world) increase local outbreaks state, Victoria. increasing exponentially. Wanna know numbers? 49 new local cases yesterday. know 49 nothing compared world, huge amount Australia/NZ. 

Domestically, state leaders (known Premiers) already expressed concern reopening *their* borders allow Victorians *their* state. believe states implementing rule Victorians undergo 14 day quarantine period. NSW Premier had, call, ""border-war"" Queensland Premier. Essentially, Queensland even opening borders NSW despite barely local cases majority recorded overseas travellers hotel quarantine.

Now much resistance domestically esp. state ""only"" 49 local cases, sure hell going open countries numbers control recording 6x Australia's total confirmed cases (7.3K) every single day. *first* country would open would New Zealand. would South Pacific countries. 

I know Australians New Zealanders would *pissed* borders States opened. sure NZ, start pandemic, majority new cases Australia imported US. full NZ mode lockdown, lockdowns US *finally* starting implement, back maybe 3-5000 cases. I'm sure speak Australians say we're definitely going jeopardise position opening borders US vaccine and/or strategy prevent cases imported US Australia/NZ. another set Karens think it‚Äôs conspiracy

Do know is?

Because 

1. masks unnecessary

2. kidding, really really need masks

3. homemade masks stupid, bother

4. wait please start making homemade masks nurses

5. wear mask time leave house

6. ever leave house

7. leave house go hiking biking, wear mask

8. wear mask outside, that's necessary

9. going catch covid die spend much time around people, especially unmasked

10. quick!! hurry back save local businesses coming buying stuff. Lucky day, come restaurants, too, obviously wearing mask 3/4 time, safe worry crowded areas restaurant like kitchen, servers' stations, dishroom - going fiiiiiiiine

Of fucking course people skeptical - federal, state, local governments every political flavor *all* failed entirely making making sense time. Demigod Dr Fauci can't even keep one train thought going day two.

You speak group Karens - overcautious ones. *only* difference group latter Karens latched information different day, deciding, ""I can't keep contradictory nonsense anymore, **this** I'm going operate moving forward."" Lol really. It‚Äôs gamble companies incur expenses staff dies favorite thing keeping digging hole deeper. It‚Äôs amusing one dumb thought lead another, another. agree!! Allowing anything indoors major mistake. Can't safely right now. death rate Sweden steadily declining since mid-April, like every EU country.

If spread exponential ""uncontrolled"" Sweden, death rate going down? think Sweden full corpses no-one noticing, show statistics? Yeah I'm sure restraunts operating 10% normal sales really jumpstart economy, lol contact trace tourists? stadiums, please.....use them. open air. you? Fucking racist. unlike police sickouts less arrests happen.

Teacher sickouts thousands children building nothing one watch them. Deviated septum make hard breath cloth, yet adds zero COVID risk. I'd allow hold outdoor events, indoor events silly fucking dude.

Funny Spanish Flu Spain, fact rumoured originated numerous locations including USA:-

Like surgeon general? You‚Äôre rude right condescending claiming UK better USA. 


I said wasn‚Äôt surprised Britain taking ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù covid-19 close borders Americans. reason closing borders? 


I never said USA boss Uk. never said America better Uk. never said we‚Äôre amazing country controls covid-19 better countries. will, American, admit country government sucked big time dealing covid-19. say one thing, countries way better Britain shutting borders, Americans others too. 


I simply said wasn‚Äôt surprised borders closing, experience British people. wasn‚Äôt one met hostile British people. sister traveled UK well got treatment. that's smart, right? stupid person knows next nothing vaccines? I‚Äôm basing covid cases appearing two weeks contraction, generally accepted scientifically backed up. apply events happened two weeks surge. look beginning surge Arizona ramped two weeks ago. look happened two weeks surge - protests. look age group demographic causing surge. Young people. 

Next compare reopening. Arizona reopened May 8-13. Two weeks reopening surge. It‚Äôs month see surge. 

Then look demographics wonder reopening seeing surge reflected data. see older groups Phoenix Arizona surging too. don‚Äôt. age group going bars grocery stores restaurants. 

This reached conclusion. Man, IHME shows guys good October model ends. Props guys hope enjoy fruits hard work.

Love nice gish gallopy list links tho country C P L kill 25% country lmao Yeah, well plenty sleep day before. Must've mild cold runny nose had. get worse next 2 weeks more. That's math virus works. see lot people wearing masks. problem see around neck covering nose useful worn correct. got people 70s 90s acting like nothing matter, middle-aged older adults 40s same.

Getting people 20's 30's responsible lose ""immortality youth"" attitude going next impossible way plan encourage behavior stern voice saying ""pretty please"".

The masks valves usually N95 similar - significantly better filtration provide protection masks, However exaltation valve ""could"" allow virus people wearer infected, possibility less likely everyone wearing mask Google ""mixed messaging + covid + uk"".

Baffling. None articles month. So, again, *current* mixed messages there. unsure of? blatant, expected example now. strange defending shit show country put up.

I'm not. We've terrible. part messaging clear, that's thing that's right. stong messaging . . . There's none that.

Correct. mean mixed. lower alert level exactly? Number 3 ""COVID general circulation"" . . . So, opening beaches obviously next move there

Beaches opened level 4. Outdoor transmission incredibly low. VE, packed beaches, BLM protests. None saw surge. downgrade 4 rising level transmission. That's case weeks. U-turn made

U-turns encouraged. tories throw shit policy, good gets reversed. Sticking guns terrible approach. looking buzzwords headlines

And thats priblem right there. Buzzwords sensationalism, added statements ""maybe xxxxxx next week"". statements pure speculation came official source.

The media twisted sorts, tried second-guess government going next. terms **official** messages, consistent. Anyone believes dumb post. Bro solid use word ‚Äúwe‚Äù imply I‚Äôm specifying particular area continue threat clarified speaking NE. yeah. surge. wondering: buying? Washington Post kept millions dark hiding ""Fox News may kept millions taking coronavirus threat seriously"" behind paywall. Brilliant. advanced irony... 38k-58k nothing sneeze at. It‚Äôs far poverty. Wales appears significantly worse per capita England last week. outside 6 feet apart think need gloves... There‚Äôs evidence reinfection. probably also giving last rights people dying, nursing home hospital they're probably carrying Corona too. 60% time works every time Self-reported polls trash.  I'm worried tourist, people states point. coming week üòê one type mass gathering since lockdown, saying correlation causation, kind weird case since protests big lacked distancing. He's asking ""logic"" correlation causation would apply gatherings. example, big Trump rally tomorrow, complain subsequent uptick, right?

First all, know != means? 

Secondly, think different transmission rates would indoor event people wearing masks vs. outdoor event everyone‚Äôs masked? NY mostly fully reopened already part? I‚Äôm near huntersville Home school vaccine safest course is. Everyone entitled hold different opinions, matter anyone else thinks opinions. makes sense. People actually taking seriously instead pretending well. I'm south florida drive work. Seen lots Ohio plates lately. Midwest states too, usual new york common. think normal tourist season. know, February 40,000 cases per day, think US pretty fucked stage. Seconded Long Island It‚Äôs done safely... really possible lot pre-symptomatic? could see limited number pre don‚Äôt vast majority people show symptoms 2-5 days? Seriously though, fuck draw goddamn line state propagandists? directly undermine democracy, direct health others, flippant bold way almost unbelievable North Korean-esque TV right America. 

Obviously freeze peech important another beast altogether. kind lost track hypothetical example exposed someone symptomatic started self quarantine day exposure. got tested next day basically fun Since area allows asymptomatic testing see like ensure give something, come back positive would went get test day got results since would several days exposure would followed local Health Department guidelines look Spain. stopped reporting data didn‚Äôt get report within 24 hours. deaths like 1 day, rest don‚Äôt make cut off, happening almost 2 weeks. knows actual figure , wanted tourists return He's reason got bad first place.  Cuomo astroturf brigade got stop. think heavily regional. US hard country generalize. *Sheesh*... Ok. Well... trip actual herd immunity, might bit bumpy... LOVE redditors take sarcasm seriously.

When trump closed borders back March said exact word would upvoted.   LOVE redditors take sarcasm seriously.

When trump closed borders back March said exact word would upvoted. told smoking weed. What? it‚Äôs money? selfish. Remember everyone media slobbering guys knob? Even refrained issuing mask order excuse people follow anyway.

A lot crow eaten ""mission accomplished"" monkeys, every stripe. say fat kids die Covid, resuming in-person school safe? California right. Let‚Äôs become authoritarian like China. Great idea. California ok way he's acted since beginning, want job all. would insurance plan take Obamacare, would plans wall place started, would better trade negotiators. obviously never Rocky Mountain National Park. hike within 45 minutes Denver weekend Nah, Blankler, allowed speak of. Let's say Blankler fans cool pretty heinous shit. PIB packed weekend zero social distancing zero masks. It‚Äôs easy point fingers others. said another thread, think crap people wait long results quicker tests available (or even results come in, people waiting long hear back) Bats also fly. learn too? girlfriend works Amazon U.S.

For part, says they're great job COVID-19 related safety measures; temperature checks doors (make sure everyone &lt;100.4¬∞F \[38¬∞C\] ) entering, distribution masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, staggering breaks lunches minimize number people close proximity, etc... 

They can't, hand, constantly make sure everyone wearing masks properly, prevent people socializing violation social distancing rules, prevent people knowingly coming work they've around sick relatives, prevent coming work they're experiencing symptoms themselves. things refer ""the human factors"". 

Additionally, works warehouse facility HVAC, often reach temperatures 110-115¬∞F (43-46¬∞C), bad enough own-- usually results 2-3 people ending hospital summer due heatstroke-- made exceptionally worse everyone also wearing masks make difficult breathe, difficult stay hydrated.  someone else says turned away, ""crisis actors"". get turned away, ""democratic hoax, ICU actually empty, I'm sure"".

There's reasoning people. me, participation trial starts July! Seconding poster, major symptom inattentive type ADHD. I'm fucked covid gives double dose barely get is. I‚Äôm gonna ruin ending you.... I'm Salt Lake City, I'd estimate 40% people wearing masks grocery store. week, masks became mandatory Salt Lake County. stores since, I've seen, heavily enforced. dont know single US airline currently this, Allegiant included. FAs probably werent enforcing rules flights. Middle seats generally occupied family specifically books seats together. 

Supposedly American United booking middle seats soon though.

Politicised economic shortsightedness strikes again, time deadly consequences

Edit - lots parallels Florida Ah ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok sacrifice grandma grandpa save economy‚Äù excuse. profile says four daughters. ok letting get sick probably won‚Äôt die.  RemindMe! 7 days I‚Äôm one them. pretty pathetic. seeing children mostly well virus I'm scared places like underlying conditions mentioned malnourished healthcare access might look different. heartbreaking. Kinda. lot bars set tables outside patrons kinda new since many bars outside dining/drinking. understand. one type mass gathering since lockdown, saying correlation causation, kind weird case since protests big lacked distancing. He's asking ""logic"" correlation causation would apply gatherings. example, big Trump rally tomorrow, complain subsequent uptick, right? cost alot research much random cases popping - as, according them, current outbreak imported strain. Yeah, France retroactively confirmed community transmission mid-December, China even identified disease.

It's pretty crazy expect containment something even know about. mean, pretty much nothing productive day. someone wants robo around, fine me. least might get shit done. experience, you‚Äôre probably minority. need that, too. I'd say squares behind square one. cases lockdown started, people impatient restrictions end. We're right fucked. ‚ÄúI would make change long takes zero effort part ‚Äú Face-to-face classes happen every country except US...what botched response way search internet inhaler gamechanger. even smoking weed without coughing now. California opened earlier Ny. US rationed materials food 3 years WWII. UK rationed *fourteen years* ...they hid subway tunnels cities got bombed. 

The reality is, US never *really* sacrifice extent we‚Äôve proved incapable without whining like little brats masks bars.

The coronavirus killed Americans Vietnam, Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq War combined.

But means, complain more. I‚Äôve travel bit recently areas 80+% wear masks almost time places maybe 20% wearing all. Anyone else trying find safe way responsibly visit older family members? seen family months dad high risk. Want visit way put risk. Currently thinking outside, 6 feet apart, wearing mask, possibly gloves. know either. Reading headline got little angry makes perfect sense.  Revolt (v.) - refuse acknowledge someone something authority.

Seems pretty appropriate here. think actually one tougher choices hypotheticals people given lately. making choice would stay wherever unless easy access service drops groceries supplies, whether that's Amazon Prime doordash kind shopping thing, favorite store would pull groceries put trunk you. access kind thing would say probably safer middle nowhere large older population living densely packed urban areas Japan, virus started winter. Without Wuhan-level lockdown, even competent government societal response would resulted disproportionately higher death rate due factors. friend‚Äôs mom lives SA got emergency blast - live suburbs San Antonio. still, scary. Thank Mr. Dog Breeder. 2 dose lifetime limit adenovirus-vectored vaccines like AstraZeneca drawback adenovirus-vectored vaccines, general, one get maximum two doses lifetime; immune system could generate neutralising antibodies attack vector, said Dr Kathryn Edwards, professor paediatrics, Division Infectious Diseases, Vanderbilt University School Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. Perhaps different type vector could used second injection, first virologist noted. Even using different vaccine technology, like DNA plasmid vaccine, booster shot could considered, Curiel said. Feel free leave businesses going get slaughtered even harder people can't travel anymore states lock second time service industry collapses.  that's people already predisposed, right? would cause many people infections? everyone catching one revealing many people susceptible along? Arizona reopened May 8 15.

The numbers, flattened lockdown, started climb noticeably around May 27, roughly two weeks reopening.

Memorial Day Weekend May 23 ‚Äì¬†25, curve really started climb two weeks that, around time protests began.

I would surprised mass gathering protests impact increased spread COVID, actual science that's done testing protesters comparing positive rates non-protesters communities far shown increased infection rate among protesters. Regardless, protesters make tiny percentage population, compared recreating close proximity, going bars restaurants, returning work without masks on.

And audacity accuse lying spreading propaganda, one came change subject order make protesters look bad. obvious participating conversations good faith, troll. I'm voting Trump always wear mask. also live DC 95% people dems like 20% people wearing masks here. soon NYC got wrapped hospital execs everywhere went back MBA style cost cutting wondering that. you‚Äôre current student? alum graduated 17 years ago live town family. percentage students think take seriously? literally least could do.

And guarantees full lockdown incoming. Can't half ass recovery.

Mask up. Hang on, talking about? future Queen looks hot. Pessimistics paranoids love dragging people path. 
I think vaccine soon, I'm hopeful find treatment months becomes less serious disease lines business MUCH better proper lockdown. current situation hurts lot ongoing issue, opposed within months.

Most commercial real estate tourism could survived March now, year year half. wearing face coverings? right answer yes. Sort asking brother brushes teeth everyday , probably hasnt done years. say yeah anyways sure heard academic (not gov) labs responsible identifying 10-15% drugs 1998-2007. Government labs..maybe 1%. percentage even lower nowadays. Soooo...are little asthmatic children sinners then? can't breathe without inhalers attacks. Must faith. Everytime hear people telling listen scientist default response. experts know anything economy.. like WTF? Everyone ignoring real reason spread LA politics.  knew someone got COVID huge party would laugh face tbh get injection inside almost cleaning? protests Practically health organizations world recommend limiting saturated fat. would probably interested evidence they've somehow managed overlook. open first place say that? Yup sounds perfectly logical test covid19 infections right? Kinda like Mueller investigate massive crimes money laundering led hundreds indictments convictions crimes never really happened right? lot heart attack stroke deaths actually COVID, evidenced fact 911 calls heart attacks deaths skyrocketed NYC time COVID deaths did.  TIL Houston, TX = America can't stop virus time that's short enough make quarantine worth it. ‚Äúparty throwing‚Äù holiday every month rest year except August, lot kids go back school. comes cold/flu season.

U dont need China succesful. ended lockdown lockdown successful slowing rate spread case increases convinced stupid people virus big deal. get car accident, throw body ditch. doubt anyone notice care. assume /s? Let know I'll deploy appropriate vote. Absolutely nothing CHAZ/CHOP protests. Nothing all. 5000 daily almost impossible get tested. NY well 10000 infections per day locked down, nobody could get tested though unless symptoms came contact someone positive. American already called it, I'm glad able visit Iceland last year! Alright. I‚Äôll read fucking article. hope you‚Äôre wasting time.

Well waste time. ‚ÄúUsing money help students‚Äù HOW??? Probably printing pamphlets forming committees. like said!

We knowhow virus spreads avoid situations.

You need avoid two situations:

1) breathing infected person's aerosolized droplets directly period 10+ minutes (close person person contact, direct airflow)

Or 

2) buildup aerosolized droplets unventilate, enclosed spaces

Both avoided restaurant lowered capacity careful planning. whatever want. 128,000 US fatalities 28 Jun 20. Per John Hopkins website, US #1 worldwide leader COVID-19 infections. Numbers usually lag day. Today's numbers yesterday, Monday's well Sunday numbers. Tuesday Monday's numbers first non weekend numbers week. False, percent positive almost double 8-10 states seeing spikes. Hospitals capacity, 10 days, deaths climb again. Think it, rate cases climbing seen last 3 weeks higher saw March, took 3 months.

I‚Äôve said I‚Äôll say trump super pro mask would guaranteed second term. literally could cake ate too. likely could stopped virus reopened economy encouraging mask wearing. Instead kept doubling acting ways actively detrimental goals sent super mixed messaging reopening still refuses lead example wear mask himself. base follow blindly matter does. could saved lives saved economy. Instead seems done neither. China instituted lockdown 500,000 people again. important vote levels government, federal government. Governor, state house senate, local elections too. Happy life remember virus hasn‚Äôt around long enough determine true long term, permanent effects. literally don‚Äôt know anything people experiencing right permanent it‚Äôs around ~six months. Despite generally pessimistic fellow Americans, really thought we‚Äôd see shift virus, see masks become accepted. I‚Äôm rather blown away hard people resisted them. It‚Äôs opposite ‚Äútough‚Äù. people refusing look weak stupid. It‚Äôs piece cloth, people. fire fighters go smoke without mask? Christ ‚Äî carpenters painters dust.

It‚Äôs shame shift attitude would valuable fight normal cold flu ‚Äî much productivity lose every year people refuse stay home sick? 

What stupid flex, people. Plans late 2020...

Is straight White House?

No vaccine ‚Äúplanned.‚Äù It‚Äôs sought after. plan right hope works. UH OH said no-no word! Good work passing blame onto employees. Nah, he‚Äôs pretty sure it‚Äôs democratic hoax. soon election passes everyone forget virus.

Richard Garay says first family South Los Angeles come COVID-19 symptoms last month, 27 others family tested positive virus.

‚ÄúIt went running nose headache full-blown fever,‚Äù said.

Around time, 60-year-old father, Vidal Garay, also got sick.

‚ÄúIt painful watch dad‚Äôs health decline drastically front me,‚Äù Richard Garay said. ‚ÄúMy father best friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúI looked father told father, ‚ÄòDad, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going make it,'‚Äù said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, last words father, that‚Äôs last thing father saw me.‚Äù

Garay eventually recovered, father passed away day Father‚Äôs Day.

Both depend proper food handling. Someone needs get guy r/iamverysmart Alcohol + pandemic = recipe disaster

Alcohol + pandemic + people close (bars, clubs) = Catastrophe

We witnessing catastrophe unfold across America people concerned getting drunk friends anyone's health.

This much worse COVID-19. COVID-19 showing us problem. Fricken pathetic pandemic literally kill 1000s people putting everyone else, people still change ways. Proof people would rather die care anyone else. Absolutely pathetic. defines America, America needs go away. No, subverted term already use refer fictional articles political opponents, turned meaning story like made look bad. Schools going disaster. Think high schools 2500-3000 teenagers one building sitting rooms 30-40 kids sitting less two feet away other. 

But deep cleaning every day. /s Well, death rate less good thing government might hiding deaths one knows exact death figure save government getting info government might well manipulating data well there's proof indeed possibility even data cases correct due fact testing quite costly average Indian even go testing can't get test flu like symptoms even traveling time everyone knows enough testing kits available India despite government shamelessly promoting states ground corona deaths compares European countries makes possibility manipulation data even convincing paying people decently choice want going make everyone unemployed? Oh boo hoo business owner board members can't buy second yacht. Cry river. TV commercial 2021: ""If non-masker age 50, Colonial Life policy cover little $6 day.""

Hopefully stays way indefinitely. pots pans banging done mixture reasons. much overconfidence India would avoid pandemic one reason another. government claimed way long everything limited handful foreigners obvious must spreading general population. got lots downvoted saying that. 

India developed slower Asian countries variety reasons. haven‚Äôt seen current leadership better worse overall previous ones tbh. share issues. current focus fighting China extremely scary danger undermine economic social progress. treatments improved, specifically dexamethasone, obisity huge risk factor got back week Outer Banks. stayed away lot public places beach fine. crowded.

Make wonder lot people masks made hit herd immunity faster. love auto mods delete posts political comments (fair do) 

But find funny since anti-health-precaution group political manufactured group, manipulated business political interests.

I think critical speak truth even medical context. Radical political anti-health groups need called out. ya, symptoms look like autoimmune reaction, like eczema plaque psorisis. crazy much reaction people virus. executive order expands one already exists. 

If family member ‚Äúincredibly ill,‚Äù they‚Äôre likely isolated hospital visitors would limited restricted completely. 

Funeral travel restricted *travel* restricted. Bereavement pay/pto doesn‚Äôt change that. order expands mandate earlier year made New Yorkers ineligible paid sick leave travel country level two three travel health notice Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Also: employees private sector take mandatory precautionary quarantines isolation COVID-19 exposure, Legislature passed law provide paid sick leave various benefits depending size employer. 

And exemptions. sick-leave order apply employee travels work employer's request, Cuomo said news release.

Also: [healthcare various exemptions limits 

And **The requirements travel advisory apply individual passing designated states limited duration (i.e., less 24 hours) course Perhaps consult doc. Provide medical clearance go disability? cannot teach conditions health, work system. Let district foot bill disability insurance. make sure get right away, consult disability attorney. make sure get ever stinkin‚Äô sick day them. Good luck you. stinks. back whole ‚Äúeveryday new record‚Äù part see second wave get first wave, make wave much worse. Washington DC NYC say otherwise. Certainly protestors contracted coronavirus net effect reduction spread. Indiam slums: Better organized states USA.

TBh good leadership, money important. Vietnam eradicated low tech methods. discipline make good decicions stick them. That's use lot ressources misused.  I'm Buenos Aires say kill 'em all! Yep, always watch actions listen words.

I wonder fast think vaccine come whether think iron fist last Maybe start letting overly aggressive cops free reign entitled assholes won‚Äôt mask.

Two birds one stone.

No holds barred, body cam shows Karen willfully wearing mask public cop treat like walking lethal weapon. actually lot young Japanese people defying Tokyo‚Äôs mayor‚Äôs emergency orders go clubs bars virus peak. interviewed clubs couple said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll dance virus away‚Äù. people common sense though. life me

This adorable it...lifted...my spirits. Jews Jews... Nailed - way Bill Gates use 5G steal information pumping microchip vaccine, much easier steal personal data Windows 10. Yeah it‚Äôs estimated around 25% expectation numbers significantly higher due unpreparedness I'd definitely like see people myself. talking guy november.  He's 37, good shape. february spent week vent.  testing accurate, can't say sure - think it.  I've never seen mid 30s person go like that, makes real me. Meanwhile still got first one. sigh Hi mnuchin. friend. start LLC. Plz send bailoit. wondering things return normal. think I'd fine going ""more"" (not lot, ""more"") live America people everything contrary flattening curve i.e. wearing face masks social distancing. Wasn‚Äôt 2-3 hour wait one point nyc? sure disinfect essential oils, bleach commercial disinfectants, toxic. mention sell them? 

/s Still true. Illogical.
And close conglomeration invites spread. virus give damn phony virtue signaling. Thanks pointing out. important hear differing perspectives. Bush senior Iraq. said would ""you picked Dad thing"".  also said oil guy elected would mean cheap gas. Completely worthless unless enforced...must enforce it!! There's doubt orange moron pressured WH medical experts guidelines released opening. said, good enough. day two later liar pressured states open even though close meeting guidelines.  Germany first weeks testing (though back blamed Germany forged numbers, strain less lethal). takes virus 3 5 weeks kill patient. can't people stop repeating every time country infection rate grows quickly? job start training medical staff specialises simple patient care required kind infection done Spanish flu pandemic. CDC something productive already! would young person take older authority seriously? like generation get free hand outs welfare sacrifice war.

Now get lower wages higher prices. ought party let old fend themselves. gave us mess, eat it. honestly surprised many people know traveling spots now. Good thing like hanging home. Ford fantastic this. someone never thought he‚Äôd ever say this, he‚Äôs really throughout lot ways. 

Anyway, ya overall united approach dealing across federal provicincial party lines greaT.

I lucky family live country. don‚Äôt envy anyone living US all, Covid. Cave Karen suppose live BC. key differences:

* Clear, consistent messaging scientists health experts, elected officials deferring experts. 

Um, that‚Äôs it, really. government functional, people understand benefits working together community. mean, already ingrained culture, things really go out-of-wack terms normality.  commented part got auto-removed. I‚Äôm astounded lack awareness would take genuinely understand that‚Äôs going come across people said *in sentence right that* screaming c0mmun¬°st plot take country. 2000cad 1200usd don‚Äôt opinion one way Seattle identifying protestor allowed avoid normal red tape getting tested albeit early data shows infection rate &lt;1%. 

While goes large crowds spread disease narrative, support multiple studies suggesting outdoor transmission rates low. Couple high % protestors wearing masks it‚Äôs shocking protests weren‚Äôt disease vector feared. want, let cheerleaders, jocks, popular kids Internet, turned popularity contests used winning. 

I would argue actually losers problem. people motivated enough communally pursue something spending time raging internet. people lives try find sense meaning rage problem. guess filter picks something small viruses would pick particle air, would clog enourmously fast replaced constantly.

It would maybe smarter put strong UV lamps air ducts kill viruses.

Anyway - use limited never fix problem guy next cought spreads virus air. really two ends spectrum. middle ground void. 4200 month later! getting surrealistic. laminated card got facebook says truths, checkmate libs South Korea, pounds, mess!

Sometimes, ok say ""I know"" let medical experts take charge matters concerning health. Summary Daniel-

1. Testing critical issues South getting swans difficult even NYC.

2. Treating patients-
Date onset crucial second week critical respiratory clotting issues. Fourth week bacteremia risk.

3. Pulse oximeter- oxygen goes 80, respiratory rate increases next day, higher risk poor outcomes

4. Blood tests


5. Chest x-ray - patients need antibiotics , 10% need them. careful overuse.

6. Elevated procalcitonin recommended enough antibiotics

7. need hospitalize everyone. People needing oxygen hospitalize

8. Chest support. Confirm keeping people ventilators crucial. ways getting oxygen including proning.

9. Antivirals - remdesivir limited, minor role.

10. Steroids - dexamethasone solid, evidence harm, dramatic improvement.

11. Anticoagulants- treated patient to
45 days. They'll tell wait take bar exam. first reaction news asking much money you, 100% wrong world atm. need get paid wear mask? Ew. Yes! needs happen. People need know virus doing. tell cold two days symptoms start clear up. mucus doesn‚Äôt thicken it‚Äôs allergies. Norovirus? one‚Äôs easy, allergies don‚Äôt give gastric problems. flu twice adult, sent bed week time.  Sorry corrected typo. Prejudice except taking group people, assigning characteristic them, criticizing characteristic. Racism born prejudice. Right occupancy 75%, hits 80% emergency measures start going effect. may not. wife mild case March April basically fine whole time - loss smell little tired. Completely back less week.  again, asymptomatic teenagers driving numbers testing really need stop going hospital /s 99.5% survival rate Somehow access supposedly blocked websites tried, directly ISP VPN. pretty crap blocking it.

Besides huge section youth interest enough work around blocks themselves. 

Not saying brainwashing, lot older thais apparently believe royal family divine. that's changing people know access LOT information.

Comparing North Korea ridiculous. Even comparing China is. course laws say something royal family junta harsh people tend publicly social media. mean unaware. 

Every post make thread (bar personal experiences 10 years ago) increasingly ignorant uninformed yourself. concern seeing increase frequency severity coronavirus style events. SARS, swine flu, bird flu, MERS etc. particular strain.

Are going keep seeing trend? going annual lockdown handle latest strains coming out? i'm you! True true. Anything COVID related supposed billed government, private hospitals still try bill patient. Foreigners pay regardless. get you‚Äôre coming from, classes spring semester atrocious, school *not* seamlessly transition online classes made learning stuff like physics biochemistry next impossible. professors didn‚Äôt capabilities really mark assignments, explanations errors given written paragraphs process printing work out, marking reuploading way much work. personally don‚Äôt know want enroll classes fall, doubt mind grades understanding material suffer. 

I say though, subjects like language literature, soft sciences like psychology, online learning adequate. assignments writing based, learning online doable. understanding material partially dependent in-person labs lot math, would rather wait. Absolutely. think key missed opportunity lockdown failure recommend essential workers wear masks go work, people going get groceries (or whatever) also wear masks. first five weeks so, late April, CDC US local public health authorities etc. still saying masks work, touch face more, bother masks, etc. think US would got zero lockdown + masks, think would cut much lower level. We'd seen post-lockdown increase, would lot manageable places like California Texas lockdown effective. Yes. That‚Äôs asymptomatic means. round antibiotics clear up, gets re-colonized someone else, he‚Äôll continue spread around without knowing it.

While sounds like it‚Äôs big deal since doesn‚Äôt make sick, treating strep lead long-term kidney damage. also riots bordering race war ever since US announced wanted investigate china outbreak. black communities throwing block parties cook outs every day without care world, ""hospitals capacity"" shown empty . Nurses ""swamped"" sickness somehow managed enough time become tictok stars twerked uniform made neato music videos... 


The fact America problem this. Don‚Äôt need second wave first one never ended. yet people upvote simultaneously believe Putin puppet master behind scenes controlling Trump. That's conspiracy theory. Hmmmm looks like Europe conditions gone minus France Ireland....gonna look this, thanks! clear:

1. wearing mask staying home.
2. go public (not time soon), would definitely wear mask.
3. think mask refusers assholes. respect all. part reason staying home.

However, believe ""FBTA card"" violates law. Maybe should, believe does. bearer FBTA card posing federal agent.

They taking advantage deficiencies ADA law. official obvious way validate person's claimed disability. 75 I've wearing mask every time step outside. needed allergy meds. awesome! masks forever! Goodbye, Flonase Zyrtec! Yeah freedom who‚Äôs real winner here? /s Yeah, satisfying job. feels good physically create something. union pays well benefits like believe. Nice I'm pretty confident vaccine. I'm also confident readily available till late 2021/ early 2022 best. Vote text.

It works American idol. like sand water aspect. live nearby pop hour two, points go away. Terrible you‚Äôve symptoms subsided guess okay. one first things said video. Judging way spelled Ch**y**na, I‚Äôm gonna wager satire. I'd say same. People google things believe know better someone degree and/or years experience.   ""forced""? mistake. Fuck them. 99.6%-98.6% survival rate per virologists, scientists, every serological study ever done. 

Report comment :) I‚Äôm leaving, comment ignorant, feel ignorant. Go read. Read real papers headlines you‚Äôll informed. r/covid19 don‚Äôt follow. way think metric care ‚Äúdeath rate‚Äù things much, much frightening economically February. One right right ignore basic social obligations. Yesterday first time going store since epidemic started (not afraid anything, need to). wore mask, felt normal. big deal, kinda liked actually. There's bits pieces evidence. like extra crematoriums built deal dead bodies. Eyewitness reports run day night nonstop.

Doctors nurses texts monitored. Infected allowed cell phone treatment. important thing note hospitals filling up, leads need vents icu care die without treatment. long go built extra hospitals. Anyways, think much thousand given population density, communal living (whole families living together), early spread known treatment understanding spread, characteristics virus etc one pays you, interested donating? seems like reasonable question certain kind person, I'll give that. called economic coercion. country pays poverty wages 60% americans live paycheck paycheck can't afford save money. either work risk contracting deadly virus become homeless. fact explained pathetic. No, simple racist weak. weak. positive story wish continued success. Indian, one thing understand, unrelated COVID19 statement waited 20 minutes name called, Lilavati, like many Indians one name.

What mean anything? guess I've known anyone *one name* article puts it. One thing become abundantly clear pandemic. Stay fuck away long term care facilities costs. First, Vitamin associated immune resilience response respiratory viruses. pretty much settled science.

Second, several studies coming various locations (find /r/COVID19) confirm true disease - Vitamin deficiency correlating higher mortality severe cases. curfew gone, reaction? rushed reasonable decision? means probably week ago maybe 2 weeks ago people infected much higher rate Where‚Äôs pepper spray at? Cops riot gear? afraid Karen‚Äôs?  Testing *capability*, tests. It‚Äôs likely manpower shortage, probably lab side, especially it‚Äôs taking long results. know set stone, anyone know mean US citizens Europe/the UK? I'm British national girlfriend American, living T4 Visa, planned trip Portugal October, would mean would unable visit left UK since December would eligible fly assuming cases drop? alarming. thing American government cares expanding power, give damn health! Quite opposite. could saved life, good got paid *Sits back watches Darwinism good work* ok, because, said, **he'll** oversight.

/s healthy cholesterol levels means less likely die... knew Right end dying ventilator right irresponsible fuckhead pandemic. Argentina using masks couple months now. cases outside Buenos Aires low, BA growing exponentially. Next week start another strict quarantine. Anyway, could talk day, I‚Äôm gonna put phone away day. Enjoy Sunday ‚ù§Ô∏è something kind stranger today üôèüèª Oh yeah know bill gates made corona virus could inject us trackers state full stupid fuckers Google - sounds awful! It‚Äôs masks. Thailand proactive since start. assigned doctors lead emergency decree, even tho PM mostly hated strict great job.

Hand sanitisers available everywhere free use since January. still lots temperature checks, mask wearing, increased disinfecting, etc. family member started 9/11 stuff, Obama birther stuff. Jade Helm Stuff, Sandy Hook, on. he's reached final form attained Flat Earther Evangelist status.

What strange sometimes conflict other. Like secret asteroid headed earth might wipe us out. possible flat earth world? Orbital physics invalid flat earth. 

Or back covid 5g activated virus, even virus all, virus common cold.

You can't argue people like this. hurts relationship. definitely can't argue online. change exactly 0 minds. People kind brain need actual therapy divine intervention. China. really cases last year went undetected, way people it. means death rate much smaller open up. old oh...oh no! cant travel abroad! guess thousands square miles American soil have.

Entitlement, compensation, complacency. sure came conclusion. Megacities cases due travel connections rest world.

There countries nothing regards lockdown. don‚Äôt agree least quarantined vulnerable, fairing better worse percentage wise countries going full lockdown. Current results even worst numbers showing less 1% death verified infection rate (in US iirc).

Meanwhile suicides depression up, economy decline, mass number businesses dying dead, unemployment roof. People afraid going doctors serious issues seen for. 

The reality COVID distorted. Initially knowing what‚Äôs going yes, panic shelter. time goes data came numbers reflect response appropriate. so, riots praised important pandemic hype media created? riots occasional mention COVID? riots mostly it‚Äôs nothing COVID that? It‚Äôs bullshit. 

Walk around average store. already know people wearing masks feel. Tell many people masks covering nose concerned, people pulling talk, constantly touch adjust it. one vulnerable fear mongers taking seriously. Don‚Äôt misunderstand me, COVID real, killing people, groups people risk major population, numbers don‚Äôt add destroying economy it. Happy Cake Day! hope makes through!

Literally anybody fucking google boogaloo is, liar. town‚Äôs that. converted parking lanes restaurant seating, closed cross streets &amp; also turned parking lots nearby restaurants. Smart, it‚Äôs working - almost everybody chooses outdoor seating. y'all cancel non essential hospital procedures like Texas did? u study proves this? talking antibodies? Sign, symptom. symptom subjective experience complaint patient, sign objectively identifiable issue. someone totally asymptomatic (ie they‚Äôre experiencing anything noticeable report) still signs disease (cloudy x ray, low %O2) People selfish. God damn it. can't live society majority cares fellow citizens? No, live place. America safety nets social contracts broke long time ago. forget many lost job also lost health insurance pay pocket expenses. people complaining $600 beyond me. get people feeling resentful, especially still working, anger misplaced. Advocat hazzard pay instead shitting people. thought trump stares!?? always thought 600 flat amount bit silly given ppl getting paid UI working. really think grand scheme that's pitiful amount compared corporations getting hundreds billions bailout irresponsibly blowing cash buybacks etc.

But people get mad poorest ppl get wee bit starve. Meanwhile bat eye corporations milking tax payers clean.

Only America.  I‚Äôm confused. saying used COVID bailout money buybacks (which didn‚Äôt) used bailout money Great Recession (which never even received... never bailed out). Either option shows baffling lack knowledge situation strong statement. mean look lake Ozarks confirmed case parties people literally top partying one person linked possibly contracting Ozarks. seems outside spread common big risk. Doesn‚Äôt make good idea honestly don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs interesting little came Ozarks. trying bring politics indoor venue we‚Äôre thousands enclosed space sitting next other(regardless it‚Äôs trump anything else) seem bit higher risk outside general. hypochondriacs Thanks clarifying.

Flu-like symptoms onset unusual. Yes, symptoms develop overnight, 8-12 hours.

Reddit replace real medical care. mom feeling bad, quickly, exposed work, evaluated goes back work-- hospital procedure now.

Do limit family's exposure right now. Good hand washing, distance possible, think masks. Snortin Lysol too. hear lemon one fabulous. might say best world. Fine, fine lemon scent. It‚Äôs amazing tell you! both? Lol like Coronavirus going care freedom breathe. No. come medical solution things go back soon There‚Äôs way hold leaders accountable all? don‚Äôt claim know called political system well, mess magnitude happens nothing done, say system governance. Go run every day.
It save life. pray trials work eventually becomes widely available. available needed most. True dat. really hard tell market driving economy way around.  3,000 died 9/11, 5,000 war terror. 50,000 fucking VIETNAM. 120,000 covid cases rising. fucking dare tell seen before. There‚Äôs way hold leaders accountable all? don‚Äôt claim know called political system well, mess magnitude happens nothing done, say system governance. Almost 1%, wear mask i‚Äôm around people one walks pull nose (unless i‚Äôm passing someone course) fogging bothers damn much! Shops finally restocking, may consider buying home advance next potential lockdown. I‚Äôm still lockdown kettle bells huge help me. It‚Äôs still same, get solid workout in. race riots recently coincided presidential elections. people need wake fact whole blm protest may yet another voter suppression ruse. mean, seems like love methods. Yes, agree. think staff owners need make living too. need compromises new ideas. Shut give stimulus money industry based tax returns? outside dining? walk ordering outside dining? Idk, time stop arguing start coming ideas. getting crazy Yeah, meningitis contagious coronavirus, think would act verify differently towards it. coronavirus contagious fatality rate meningitis, probably still heard yet. It‚Äôs hit miss Oregon too. live high rise air conditioned hallways unit AC. Grocery stores target usually it, restaurant worked window-like AC unit pretty rare restaurants. correct Cool opinion, bro.

Unfortunately you, [the actual research done topic found protests cause significant spike cases believe otherwise, fucking prove it. Stop telling opinions beliefs are. care.

I care prove. I've proven arguments true. turn now.

Minneapolis HUGE spike cases right now.

So, go get data come back disprove me. Go ahead. EVERYONE TAKE VIRUS SERIOUSLY 

What hell ‚Äúreport‚Äù even? written Greg Abbott himself? Go ahead watch recent town hall meetings absolute idiocy, notice it‚Äôs mix age groups young ones there. 

We don‚Äôt get control groups start taking seriously. purpose even serve? Shame young comply older generations continue jack crap, shame it? Enough enough, let‚Äôs come together regardless age/race/gender/political party actually come together curb thing. pretty certain case, sucks many people US stuck situation. restaurant near current workplace staff walk Dec. 23rd, middle catering rush, owners *that* bad. impressed spine shown, definitely helped city faces huge shortage restaurant staff time. Easier walk like place settled already Sadly enough Americans lost many ""freedoms"" since 2001 said shit ‚Äì masks? Hoo boy, THAT'S hill worth dying on. Oh yeah high hopes adjusted MERS vaccine Come like bash U much person that's rude poor nations. Even wanted test lack ability nope U.S lack money greed made bad. 38.8% positive past 2 days .... love that. think people saying virus dangerous could we've learned lot hospitals better able treat people it. change fact gone unchecked it'll overwhelm hospitals people needlessly die sorry loss. Every person counts. 
This terrible tragedy people take seriously enough. work restaurant Boca Raton, south Florida. tens thousands cases county alone.

Seriously??? live Delray...PBC 12,785 cases. That‚Äôs lot, it‚Äôs ‚Äòtens thousands‚Äô. hyperbolize shit? think hold college students high regard. They‚Äôre basically children adult freedoms, see well adults handling this... seat empty makes little difference realize 50% customers better 0%? go back 100% vaccine, back 0% again. Mine, too. Mine weeks well, I'll probably get nice beer, bake cake (or pie? both?) make something disgustingly unhealthy like air fryer cheese fries breakfast. 

And since can't anyone over, **I share damn cheese fries ** co-worker testing coronavirus. told quarantine till get results. Work told come anyway, knowing positive not. found morning commute negative, makes wonder many people told come anyway virus. I'm disputing that. I'm disputing claim ""most"" people contract coronavirus die. guess closer .02% people catch die, 50%+ (or most). keep insulting me, explain think 50% people get die. choice. going say, unless quarantines become seriously mandatory, people this. half surprised airlines don‚Äôt insert bit code cannot book return fight 14 days departure. vaccines Covid 19 ‚Äúmythical‚Äù? That‚Äôs arrived all. 
I put much preliminary data Oxford vaccine argue vaccine exists also looks promising. 
I could link preliminary results China‚Äôs front runners (Cansino Sinovac) published far. could link articles China already offering citizens (essential workers travellers) vaccines emergency use. 

But doubt it‚Äôll make difference. Everything bigger Texas. includes impact responses global pandemics. They'll probably ban second land. proven without government enforce public safety, relying nature people going sustain modern society? suspect headline we're gonna get keep using changing number. would know none wearing masks. fuckin preach social media wear masks Who? Good Sure I'll small things. said wasn't? point world ending not. 

If outlaw driving prevent road accidents. put seatbelts on. think number people die road deaths small dip selfish prick? snear everyone owns car? 

Now seriously quash virus? quarenetine everyone indefinately. extend lockdowns stop world last 2 months, rest year. think 1.6m dead completely unnaceptable never leave house vaccine, retrain healthcare workers. Stop everything like asteroid going destroy world. 

So swine flu 500k people died? probably fuck all. Waiting see happens Chicago. haven‚Äôt seen uptick, biggest protest occurred three weeks ago point. went four every single person saw wearing mask. also received test week turned negative. Sounds like Florida bars... Bullshit Also whenever anyone tries play it, prepared we've pandemic, we've done prevent spreading one.

Graphs data comparing viruses paint picture would done act. done much damage despite much we've done prevent it. middle aged boomers usually ones preaching masks form government mind control? Lmao mean said speculative though, guess lot virus hasnt confirmed claims speculative point lol. 

tangents fun though. im wondering body reacting virus reaction releasing histamines, like allergic reaction, creating larger openings cells allowing virus spread infect skin cells. might cause another overreaction body, signalling cells attack subcutaneous cutaneous cells may exposed infected by, sars-cov2, foreign object, example areas like hands, feet, armpits, inner thighs susceptible bacterial/fungal/viral infections due either optimal conditions foreign objects grow, contast exposure foreign object. 

all speculative though, thats point discussion guess lol It‚Äôs kind perfect storm, one billion circumstances. 45(prez) dilluded trust country literally created ‚Äúfake news‚Äù phenomenon number 1 cause disaster. Even educated Americans doubted virus mostly watch Fox news(because president convinced news fake) get one side story. fox side story make virus seek like flu want trump get elected economy stay open make money. suggest do? solution. Right!! feel like people rooting worst case/bad things happen. Like feed it. guys jumped ahead per capita though unfortunately... far we've avoided what's going there.

So far... ""Donald Trump took whatever poison vaccine, they're safe making america great again!""

.

Its non problem. Theyre brainwashed North Koreans Dear Leader. Imagine getting coronavirus birthday present. okay dude that‚Äôs one picture. that‚Äôs one stage. that‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúidk anybody COVID, it‚Äôs real‚Äù 


go watch live streams protests. people constantly moving standing side side significant periods time minneapolis. there‚Äôs times 500+ standing side side none hours end extroverted misses general experience vibe/energy. also idiot gone eat anywhere, even patio  Hey, I'm wasnt Dude idea. r/Masks4All ... created stunned American. knows don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going get bad financially everyone makes informed decision. Otherwise, I‚Äôll get back that. üòÜ Fuck. really wish luck strength full recovery. understandable, stupid. Basically, we're taught freedom paramount, freedom means whatever (as individual) want to, matter anyone else thinks. We're taught, repeatedly forever, entire country founded reason. kind individualism simply cannot provide answer pandemic pandemic individual phenomenon, even cross minds wearing mask would selfish, might kill someone care about. focus entirely freedom wear annoying thing faces, tyrannical oppressors trying force to. that, wearing mask, standing values country founded on, minds, they're heroes defending country (and yes, that's dramatic ridiculous, everything else here). Yes, losing antibodies mean losing immunity vote November, even still leaves states right whatever want. government give recommendations comes whether lock give mandates that's entirely state's governor, theory could 50 completely different plans common mathematical mistake. tests per capita country world. enough test 1/500 population every day. 5% positivity, that's enough diagnose contain disease 1/10000 population infected per day.

By comparison, Italy tested 1/1400 population per day peak. Korea testing 1/3400 population per day.

Upping level anywhere closer 1 1/10000 far beyond us. issue lack testing, (Texas) using effectively all. Containment fine line, go past point alternative regain bring R value 1 via social distancing. means either wearing masks (impossible) staying home.

Mitigation impossible level spread virus without extreme social distancing bring R &lt;&lt; 1.1. means either stay home get 70% infected within next couple months. mother lives side country, can't that. saw year, visit got canceled due pandemic.

I'm putting anyone risk visit, hell, even step shopping anymore. yeah, mom family, miss her. curious see danger arriving town, fly wait 3 days landing isolated hotel room, get tested (at least CA turnaround time less 24 hours drive test). may lose ticket 3 days hotel room basement / guest house / attic. likely test negative probably already time arrive it.

If drive even better, get tested isolate waiting response drive there. Maybe leaders backbone would guidelines. look sports news media people clamoring college athletes suck play it. ones risking reduced lung capacity rest lives. Interesting take, thank you.

Ok, I'm 5 year+ account. regularly post sub racist name covid, gets instant ban name it(it's ""first Chinese city lockdown flu"" one). I've never seen videos alluding to. Please link them. see videos people country coughing stores, but, flu season, asian-americans exist, ya know? expect convince people anything based facts reasoning realized losing battle. 60 years studies research show face masks stop spread influenza, people demand masks politicians media oblige. 

I work water district uses divining rods find underground pipes, rather proven technology. People look like I'm idiot say work. ""But I've seen work eyes!"" We've added new silly superstition culture face masks, enjoy ride.  r/Masks4All worldwide tho! really thought disaster would work, too, tbh. worked far better 9/11, least. remember basic sense unity people (unfortunately excluding Muslim friends every bit heartbroken rest us). 

This just... really, really dark. We've hit point basic empathy seems exist people honestly know would need happen reemerge. 

Like, think actually take seeing field hospitals spread place - unable get away sound ill dying cough gasp air - people would lose enough self-righteousness even shut hell up. even know they'd truly allow understand gravity situation part it. 

I'm flabbergasted. know divisions always here, genuinely feel like country grew in. much colder, contentious, angrier place guess hope younger generations rebound division hard move towards unity. don‚Äôt get much high quality that! study does, although disagree one findings. point humidity impacts survivability aerosols, based NIH Guinea Pig study got two two things wrong IMHO. state higher humidity increases survivability aerosol state. science actually says opposite. Also, day decrease cases Italy explained mandating face coverings, stated temperature humidity directly impact survivability virus aerosol form, ignored impact Italy transition Spring Summer instead credited homemade face masks benefit. Based upon findings controlled humidity. Without solving change humidity little Correlation imply causation. remains credible science homemade face masks reduce COVID transmission. direct scientific findings surgical grade masks.

You‚Äôve probably studied war propaganda ww1/2.. there‚Äôs reason dubbed war invisible enemy.

You can‚Äôt tell videos real? 10 guys publicly display body orange stand bag lol?.

The videos purpose shock gain compliance, can‚Äôt exactly fake death numbers. possible.

I can't.
Gives every indication kind, probably better person ways though I'm trying best person honor someone died decade ago miss every single day, easily better butt me, still...
sometimes simplest answer easiest one, okay lean way.
I'm pretty sure dinosaur hide fossils, example, can't faked.
to say nothing blood samples eggs. People want wear masks shop makes hard breathe. know cop neighboring Mt. Juliet TN threatened resign enforce COVID social distancing mask rules. bet absolutely enforced. seeing slow rise NY? I've seen meandering numbers nothing indicates trend upwards. 7 day average consistently flat around 600 new cases per day. close then. make sacrifices Well put. warned several times opening early.  moot point. 

A. going let burn community like Sweden?

B going go 2ed lockdown? Common sense maybe? Barney still TV I'd say dinosaurs real He's lying India testing 1/20 rate per capita US. Work fast food restaurant yes, summed perfectly. Florida resident hospitality industry Disney area. I‚Äôm basically forced go work, endanger children earn living. refuse don‚Äôt get unemployment. cut 50% today place fucking packed, empty seat, many wearing masks. don‚Äôt understand wrong people. Without legal enforcement...........it matter. ohhh boomer moron see riots Hollywood last night. Stop lying. side note, pump full antibiotics point ? develop bacterial infection ?

Because read *really* interesting thread Reddit couple years ago people saying never got panic attacks put strong antibiotics. definite link gut mood... might worth looking into. nothing else get eat delicious fermented foods like sauerkraut kim chi !! would absolutely losing mind lived there. It‚Äôs frustrating enough watching distance. Maybe finally take break free lie American Exceptionalism. feeling they'll close dine also. Florida, restaurants carry liquor license requires least 51% food sales. understanding still serve alcohol table side, may wrong. I've service/hospitality industry now. matter many times load page, crashes. think enemies compromised it. Yup, found one. I‚Äôm kidding, suggesting lie. really read symptom people having, really think people knew mask wearing would go up. Even parts NY hit phase 4, going fully re-opened. Cuomo keeping places like gyms, movie theaters, believe bars/clubs closed still state feels safe enough proper procedures place open back up.

After fumbling initial response, tri-state area done everything longer drop ball. I'm glad I'm living Western Australia. 

After isolation 3 months, restaurants finally allowed open limited capacity, friend touch cabin fever decided go lunch first weekend lifting restrictions. 

I called restaurant 3 days advance, asked taking reservations day wanted, booked it. got there, two groups 3 people seated, restaurant normally could seat 70+. Everyone seated far apart possible. Part getting complimentary drinks also waitress take names telephone numbers tracking contact event someone getting sick. 

We fully expecting bunch people lined outside, people complaining, so-forth, case. impressive, say least. you; think rural areas US hit hard many one hospitals. bar open? would agree younger people better day, bars packed night masks Work fast food restaurant yes, summed perfectly :/. smaller face even adult woman. found ‚Äúteen‚Äù sizes makers make work better even better masks cut curve jaw, etc don‚Äôt gap aren‚Äôt wide stop ears (where otherwise gap). ordered dozens masks Etsy filter pockets nose wires fit nicely. DM send couple shops masks worked well (both Canada believe deliver US).

Also got one half face respirator 02 Canada places social distancing becomes even harder. Say yes feign sickness near time. heard, ""It's Liberal hoax designed destroy freedom!""? /s long's gonna last? There's new wave. first wave never ended. new infected people infected whole thing started.

The virus person respects lockdowns stops existing nobody leaves home. virus came stay it'll stay almost everyone gets contaminated.

I'm realistic. can't control virus without cure. can't keep people home months / years, either. might delay problem, creating another problem risk breaking country.  That's I'm afraid of, state report someone tests positive restaurant. coworker test positive inform employees worked him. another 2 maybe 3 get tested due symptoms. know fact none guests know positive plus multiple probable cases. Well said. depressing everyone taking China word constantly lie everything. trait many despise American leader Trump xi jinping seems get free pass. Ah, tight junctions.

The general selfishness disregard greater good infuriating, can't believe right now. guess want second term...  military denying recruits recovered Every big city protests every big city resurgence.

I keep pointing NYC, DC, SF Chicago huge multi day protests even bump cases- whether absolute per capita.

LA however dine restaurants bars reason. already done so. Numerous patients tested yesterday due Father's Day parties attended positive cases. Source: clinic. Yo, wear glasses outside mask... bridge nose Additionally, seem understand, folks bills pay can't stay locked forever. Survival fittest term reason. Plus, far testing far less deaths. That's sad two ways. Cheer up, point daily infections daily tests number infected capped! *Carl Everett entered chat* found nearby COVID positive person week ago. completed test local CVS drive thru 30 minutes later. symptoms, pre screen, test.

I‚Äôm South East Georgia. Living small town South probably able get tested quickly. think cities struggling test massive populations have. Saw TV people waited hours Phoenix 105 degrees. It‚Äôs exactly politics. virus accelerating big cities struggling keep up.

Obviously, slowing deaths immediate goal. death outcome. fear people find false sense security looking deaths long term consequences yet seen. 

Not viral related daughter developed severe pre eclampsia. used something outright killed women. obviously survived longer two years, probably medication rest life now. yeah, people may think pre eclampsia big deal hardly KILLS anyone anymore. still SUCKS. know several women strokes left lasting damage well.

My opinion coronavirus deliberately mishandled UK USA. 

In UK, ill patients covid decanted care homes caused mass die old people.

It's cull. Well gonna live life part right. Think people grocery wearing masks touching breathing near items shelf. funny thing is, someone country prior mask-wearing culture, feel like mask gives added privacy I'm less identifiable public. idea thought people would get behind, privacy-driven objections contact tracing apps.

I'm Austria, mask wearing I've ever seen hospital (and even surgeons).

With start Covid19 masks made mandatory stores everything non-essential shut down. go store without mask? kick leave get fined police.

So went never wearing mask always wearing one house (when ending businesses).

Now numbers we're back wearing masks (except doctor visits / drug stores). feels kinda weird go grocery shopping without mask now. terrifies me. already debilitating long-term condition firm timeline recovery, really don‚Äôt want another one.

I careful before, second wave hits I‚Äôm leaving house. measures take take least 2-3 weeks even begin seeing effects. surge capacity exhausted (and signs point will) that‚Äôs people actually start dying. cannot take care everyone.

G G G G G little terms severe spike positive cases percentage tested.

That objectively false statement. severe spikes positive statement percentage tested. overall US % positive 6.4% low 4.4% might seem like lot 1. upward trend week 2. difference 2% worrying considering diverse various areas are. Also various states reporting incredibly high % positive tests - 20%. Yeah, reading option. bed NO-NO. Karma chasing America everything countries oil.

Lol, I‚Äôm going speak Irish perspective here. virus numbers low past couple weeks, pretty much every day low double digits single digits new cases. seemed hit peak numbers declining, we‚Äôve also done testing. US numbers seem keep rising peak sight yet, I‚Äôd say wait couple weeks saying you‚Äôve done better job countries containing virus.  Happy cake day! Sadly, majority Americans understand comment literally problem. say money root evil. basically link every single fucked thing back money. making rotten lemonade rotten lemons. Come proof then.

Skepticism like Ferrari, it'll safely get *if* honed abilities, else spinout end cult personality.

is clear? Sitting UV lamp strong enough kill virii. idea fun. states testing yanked right now, miss huge others Texas? could gather experts around country work organized centrally..... use tax money fund know crazy idea use good nation good leadership? 

Out..of..the..box. USA - roughly 4.25% total population roughly 25% deaths. know dumbfuck ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù morons can‚Äôt ‚Äúmath‚Äù you. 'Twas play words, matey.

People distracted media go protest BLM crap country undergoing recession execs governors ripping people left right. No, article ""make sound"" like all. faulty take it.

In fact, talks stimates doctors many could them. American. wrong. I'd allow there's qualitative difference ""death terrorism"" vs ""death illness"", that's another debate. Numbers-wise, point.  I'm lawyer, unlicensed use DoJ symbol illegal act? I'd love see anybody touting one stupid cards thrown prison and/or fined heavily. obvious protective measures work well environments though.

A bit theory question know but, say example, 2 people park next within normal conversation distance without mask one virus...what likelihood people getting infected? friend telling Roman Reigns couldn‚Äôt wrestle Bc immunocompromised beating leukemia WWE erased history books don‚Äôt allow wrestlers mention talking managing tests. Ofc, coronavirus management feels like Shanked rusty chain holding filled bus Volcano. Home equipment crazy expensive, unless talking two dumbbells resistance bands. Hella respect homie mean Nazis political sense, Seinfeld soup-Nazi way ;-)

You know, little old ladies chastise people know grocery stores wearing masks. (Even though idea person's medical history.) ""'If want wear mask, stay home.' WWE really want see masks television.""

I‚Äôm also unemployment work every single day risking Covid bullshit dude reading comment shows many people quick judge yet lack gift perspective India never ample testing beginning data reflects, imo, testing ramping up. certainly double edged. people think twice traveling, try cheat neighbors. Found American. She. Send scared heart grey anatomy. knew going there. I'd kill best circumstances they‚Äôve made strip whatever testing‚Äôs left state that‚Äôs hot spot, opposed allocating resources properly getting *more* instead less? best idiot president make hand remark people slowing testing? it‚Äôs come told staff remove social distancing stickers little rally too? also running social distancing stickers?

Yup, makes perfect sense. wonder we‚Äôre failing hard this. Agreed. friend's sister dying lung cancer. 42 never smoker; doctors think cancer might linked HPV. incredibly scary people cavalier COVID know post-virus effects are. got shorter term stuff like CFS lung scarring, long-term unknowns - thing cause cancer? Children might shake now, affect adults? know. Nazi terrorist eh want people stop taking vacations hotspots bringing virus back. know many people planning go MIA 4th July. It‚Äôs reckless selfish. It‚Äôs hard forgo vacations summer. Tell eskilstuna said spread virus,

Sorry everybody lost loved one. know pain reliable.. Agree middle ground. thought welding close multiple entrances apartment blocks control monitor entry/exit could wrong. 

At least agreement basic social responsibility including wearing face masks etc. It‚Äôs total travesty it‚Äôs become needlessly politicised polarised USA. Nike make mask. People US would wear it. Good news! ‚ÄúConfirmed cases‚Äù Kid bias showing. delete post. I‚Äôm immunologist (just chemist), virus doesn‚Äôt seem mutating major way, meaning vaccine shouldn‚Äôt changed frequently. However, people afraid may need readministered frequently (booster shots). point, needs studied since don‚Äôt know long actually protected. 3 days deaths. still going stronger ever.

Also remember 3000 people died 2001. response proportional willing ruin economy millenia per capita test matters. Test positivity rate relevant metric number tests. per guidelines WHO, TPR less 5% . USA, 8.11% India 6.45%. countries increase testing. comparatively India done better testing USA. Yes two outcomes getting covid. Either die gets bad need go hospital, leaves life long damage. Disregard fact vast majority barely notice it, small percentage need hospital care. exciting.

THE END NEAR wait pre-employment screen includes COVID antibody test Louisiana, we‚Äôve able get tested WITHOUT symptoms 6 weeks. doctor visit, nothing. time, could find drive testing sight, walk up. It‚Äôs amazing I‚Äôm still hearing stories people wanted get tested couldn‚Äôt. April us. Ever since then, problems testing. Even anti-body tests now. Bars Dinosaurs! get either. state amazing weather, year-round many places. Make outdoor-only.

Thank conscientious! :D sounds awful really scary, I'm glad made through.

Dexamethasone really helped me, also lingering heart issues. shit incredibly infuriating, see firsthand local level. I'm senior leadership healthcare organization medical member leadership team. state published reopening guidelines week later places begin reopening, pushed back fought hard stop stupidity. blatantly asked others changed spread numbers made sense? said bad idea, explained why, even gave exactly instead protect employees others.  


Nobody listened address exposed employees even employees testing positive frequently week every week passed.  


We hotspot US, organization bringing staff back working home. learned returning second two-week isolation period due symptoms second time tested virus. speechless. asked anyone knew recent case numbers, someone quoted, followed silence stares.  


Then two people walk meeting without wearing masks, previously working home.  


I told can't stand surrounded clueless idiots longer walked door.  


The moral story everyone ignores experts, surprised outcome. happens patient care level, patients wanting argue recommendation diagnosis 10 minutes research google Facebook mommy groups. happens system level non-clinical administrators leaders either ignoring input team's medical experts, even bothering involve all. happens national level, see. Ahahahaha wtf dude seriously. idea much 100k is? unrealistic best expect earn much unlearned work did, Congrats! probably one handfull people world got lucky jesus 27% stupid high positivity rate. agendas. literally family. Every weekend got invite something else im getting upset family members havent left home 3 weeks. 3.

People PISSED bars closed. know guy flew Las Vegas upset bars restaurants closing/limiting capacity. No, I‚Äôm joking. No. busy hiding place like person lick sense. 

But yeah, last time went out, people everywhere walking around like joke. 

We fair share ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Tread Me‚Äù ‚ÄúIt God‚Äôs Hands‚Äù crowds.  

It terrible think, kind hope people ones get hurt attitude, opposed others putting risk them. seen details, probably washable cloth ones like ones NY(NYC?) &amp; Japan sending reminder what...? happily joking around getting seriously ill? send link footage clearly peaceful march? lol website? 

Such drama queen. Humans working opposed to? people complaining shit tesla detailed plan company cared have. I'm surprised 20% are... Oooo shocking terrible experience endure seeing people masks on. hope you‚Äôre coping well PTSD maskless people incident. Yes! Let‚Äôs use mortality data worldometers! read thought might need lung transplant, several Vietnamese volunteered transplant. Fortunately, didn‚Äôt come that. People desperate protests retroactively safe.

But I'd OK gather big groups outside, attended sporting events festivals safe too. Blaming population ignorant Americans dangerous path go passes blame actually responsible actually something about.

Yeah, leaders act within boundaries politically possible. protestors storming government institutions assault rifles multiple health directors quitting they've received death threats, point point big chunk blame squarely onto citizens. Maybe trump Florida... winning Maybe OP implying next year worst December / January, months generally see cases Flu (I used work ED). months likely devastating amount COVID cases, overrun hospitals, months following, deaths. I'm aware. That's mentioned drop bucket compared entire population OK treating situation.  Viruses absolutely cause strokes. Covid related stroke believed possibly caused shingles. either shingles outbreak autoimmune disease later diagnosed with. way ever know sure was. viruses cause vasculitis lead blood clots, strokes. they're thinking happening Covid? Inflammation blood vessels? Nah Russia would leave private shake CEOs Investors. Every major city did. Yeah, they've botched things, zero right information time. longer they've looking something, accurate I'd consider information. article posted suggested kids catch transmit kids adults. Trump. Ontario starting see growth lmao. Yesterday fewest cases months, today second fewest. perpetuating complete misinformation 


This video made China response virus, U.S.'s irresponsible reactions, continuous China demonizing .  


China obviously lot problems, pretty unfathomable much respect citizen's lives, least regards corona-virus, U.S. they're not, should. 

Coming American citizen guys need read article, title misleading:


Garay believes father first one family contract virus routine hospital visit blood transfusions Vidal Garay required every two weeks result sideroblastic anemia myelodysplastic syndrome. one transfusion early June, doctors told father tested positive COVID-19.

Garay said father first began showing COVID-19 symptoms, family aware could coronavirus father ""always felt sick.""

He believes father spread everyone lived him, including Garay, mother, wife, Garay's two children aged 5 2, Garay's younger brother. think starting hit younger age groups broader sense. guess thing left dumb ones believe leader catches virus dies think American attitude can't guy walked thru Mayo clinic without mask concerned virus? changed here. Tear gas kills COVID!!!  makes sense all.

1. protesters willing drive 300 miles Seattle protest?

2. protesters counties 300 miles away?

3. Seattle infections spike proportionally meaning protesters came Seattle itself? comment gold far down. Corona poor id gold myself. Smart think mean ""leadership."" Authoritarianism partly we're mess. would pay them. mandate clothes - school pay those. mandate let parents take care kids. Little Johnny forgot mask? Little Johnny can't come building. take anything says solid  Agreed. mentioned still wear one despite cases month live. worth risk me. Covid would probably destroy point. Stay safe! Try get assigned something else. health worth it. major anxiety depression too, thought taking temperatures encountering potentially sick people day long awful. Someone it, doesn‚Äôt you. Last checked asthma high risk factor. Probably varies person person. Everyone‚Äôs immune system reacts differently. [This video video diary nurse going disease beginning end, commentary lung disease doctor Johns Hopkins. One doctor‚Äôs first comments first onset symptoms body‚Äôs initial defense invading virus. Theyre probably updating maintenance  Haha figured New York.

We upstate 3-1/2 year old wear mask. Speech delay + developmental issues. much needs start back school, doubt it‚Äôs going happen.

I‚Äôd rather safe healthy. One less passenger Deltidiot Airlines. Lots options. biggie. Shut downs help tremendous amounts places take shut downs seriously, long, extended uninterrupted period time. Even places restrictions time let immediately everyone throwing house parties. Even EU ‚Äúno positive two month‚Äù cases. 

But really, USA reside handling coronavirus well ALL, well, anything quite time. I‚Äôm getting quite sick it, ask me. responsibility accountability anything anyone anymore QUITE sick it, yes am. American got passport beginning year, ready start traveling world, fully understand expect passport sadly remain empty good longer.

I can't, won't, blame countries one bit. hate downer, studies UK showing potential permanent damage lungs via scarring (pulmonary fibrosis). fail recover, may want check that. scary, better know get treatment let progress.  take zonc vitamin c d, help infection Ok northern BC - - yeah almost Alberta, pretty much noone wearing masks. numbers lot lower south Vancouver central BC. Also much testing going numbers looked lot better were. Mind everyone locked pretty tight 6WEEKS. dead hidden infections seemed fizzle. now, wow forget lock down. Everybody camping, shopping, back normal essential shop keepers masking going get nails hair done. definitely surged Houston one largest protests thus far.

I think point article point protests automatically mean surges, reopening early likely does. Houston reopened early (or botched it), ICU capacity. also large protests mean that's also caused it. would cancel events fake news hoax? Sorry bud, hasnt debunked yet. Wow. Crazy. Yeah, incredibly disturbing worrying think might preparing keep power. 

We however later find paratroopers Fort Bragg. 700 them, none thought say ""Uh legal, Im obliged follow orders."" Thats scared me. Apparently blood type gut biome plays meaningful role severity. hardest hit country world comes coronavirus? They‚Äôd stupid to, say American Wild. Stay safe there. Masks need mandatory. mental toll people real different people different points stop caring others. help there's well developed propaganda network Anunson administration trying amplify this.

It justify doing, explanation. I've surprised often I've seen companies dirty laundry, whether restaurants tech whatever, treat bottom-rung underlings really poorly, underlings know business. asking trouble way. Maybe calling asking why? hope feel better soon.

I never needed inhaler, either, since covid I've using one around clock. Since started steroids, needed less.

Non covid pneumonia take 6-12 months heal - lungs heal themselves. I'm staying hopeful might need time. thats debunked bullshit... amount people wanting go back gyms immediate second opened back worried HELL me. one LAST places going to.

Honestly avoid gyms rest year. pushups shit home, don‚Äôt *need* gym workout first place. FFS. didn't. said, people USA, wear masks well, look photo above, prideful mask less warriors equality. look dangerous me. don‚Äôt think indoor dining right move time though. drive outdoor bars NJ ridiculously crowded nobody wearing masks standing top other. cannot imagine it‚Äôs gonna like July 2nd. need look around see what‚Äôs happening reopen. It‚Äôs good. Wait till end summer. 'Darling, know, never places like this.'

'Why go test now?' too! scared. got itin March I'm still back 100% sense smell. think one big things separates disaster others slow is. 9/11, Katrina, Sandy, tornadoes disaster pretty instantaneous. hard ignore destruction one minute everything fine, next chaos. 

This slow largely invisible. fact death toll lags far behind infection rate also throws people complacency. 9.5k cases Florida today ""BUT DEATH TOLL LOW!"" uh huh....get back couple weeks. seems people short term memories.

And well add we've politicizing .....here are. Wait, thought common knowledge that. last saw 98% 2 days ago... next day CEO's said dont need work next day page disappears.. actually loved it. think passive aggressiveness sport, could olympics. 

The free refill people completely fuck paying attention tables, sweet sing song voice walk say ""Oh! forget bread? Silly me! One sec!"" repeatedly ""forget"" apologize ad nauseam they're steaming mad. Cheap fucks splitting entree, trying fill bread example would get basket maybe every 20-30 minutes that, yes would time it, would enter standoff see little time worth would give up, angrily ask check (which course appeared promptly) leave. would see tables around getting amazing service would piss even further. 

The worst punishment got trick regular (who tipped whatever pennies left bill, plus one Lifetime pen profession school photographer) vehemently declared could NEVER serve again. every time came restaurant Id loudly tell everyone ""not allowed"" serve give huge smile. 

I'm terrible person, actually lived days dickwads would try me. easy piss people get bowl ranch. Nah, well known Covid affect large gatherings causes  live southern California , 50 year old boss seemed awfully proud getting first haircut months yesterday ... . .he also one "" affects old people "" "" feel like people making bit overblown "" guys right aorund April  ....  understand . Correct I‚Äôm wrong, don‚Äôt think anything technically illegal stoppable this. Especially she‚Äôd probably point saying isn‚Äôt paid enough one job alone...despite fact she‚Äôs selfish idiot. you‚Äôre fear mongering please stfu this. 

even america got it, 20% people would experience symptoms bad enough go hospital. fundamentally do. children thinking edgy gambling. Good. We'd would expect places well  bad beginning, lockdown. highly contagious, surprising many people practicing social distancing life going back normal, ramped again. you‚Äôre enough testing. would make laugh less dad me? um......

no..... Um, take peep US what‚Äôs going vacation destinations (ahem, Florida) get crazy vacation plans. again. defunding police help regain control virus. everyone decides want, police help?  I'm extremely cautious, me, feel safe(and left), others might ok it. theory could hold breath demask temp check, it. Especially head thermometers around easily used. seemed business usual masks(with varying levels proper wear). governor earlier week pretty much said ""hell no"" asked moving backwards. really try get political kinda hard huge impact mine along friends family Florida's lives right now. good old case pneumonia immensely debilitating. looking month previously healthy person climb stairs without keeling over. looking 6 months things get back 80-90% normal. people fully recover, don't.

Most mechanical bits body heals super well (bones, skin, flesh) thinks like lungs, ligament, etc don't. 

And ignores organs affected COVID associated treatments. also experience. need training COVID precautions. would mean CEO's would lose money, get money. think IMAX theaters yacht's gold plated toilets pay themselves? Actually they‚Äôre finding protests aren‚Äôt actually connected areas spiking. areas things opened soon Hey Bill come Canada, welcome, educated rationale here...you would fit right in.

Yes yes yes speak singapore. extensive testing, especially migrant worker population (systematically working testing 300k them, halfway done). means 50% cases completely asymptomatic, 90% cases young, relatively healthy migrant workers. singapore's healthcare system world-class overwhelmed, currently (1 case ICU, 174 hospitalized). Community spread currently low (mandatory mask law strictly enforced), probably rise soon began reopening two weeks ago. 

One thing i'm happy they're counting deaths consider covid primary cause death. least number reported, there's currently 26 official covid deaths 11 additional deaths covid-positive counted. lot criticize singapore government, they're definite lying numbers. Also one dies heart attacks illness anymore. tagged Covid. There's recover fine, hear them. Ya that's scares man, buddy like 3 weeks???

It like never goes away Sex outlawed. Nope Also interesting happened time knowledge source disease spreads control it. ironic even though present day know lot things microscopic detail certain section population blind closed-minded Black Plague. ultimately diseases like awareness general population matters net net progress time Black Plague impressive. system threefold. president cabinet, Congress, courts. theory, done always system checks balances, one branch could run amock without two holding back. Unfortunately, system already strained overburdened conflicts fostered current administration pandemic basically ripped chance national unity apart. individual local governments best handle things regionally, effective threat taken seriosly -- many politicians so.

I glad California right now. numbers good we're also populous state, third largest, numbers always high. Governor locked us fast, poured whole surplus budget keeping unemployment flowing, lowered wait time recieve it.  also political parties working together keep sustained long can, agreed new budget settle (now) deficit keep people home. sucks much state could much worse sitation are. glad closed did. John oliver thing WWE.

I watched twice. hospitals great. Their's huge medical tourism. even government hospitals, looking run basic, job (I've used them).

The road deaths thing terrible though. Due lockdown curfews they've here, plus fact contained Covid, overall deaths year significantly down. 

Yes test rates low, percentage positive miniscule there's need higher tests now. people dying mass would impossible hide here. love social media. They‚Äôre saying things they‚Äôve always said. you‚Äôre young healthy main worry spreading it. you‚Äôre elderly/immune compromised worry protecting yourself. novel virus public ethics tells nations need act harshly first dictate necessities later. cases per million current rate increase, USA, Sweden, Brazil upwards trajectories graph.

 really. demonstrates don‚Äôt know ur talking about. conflicting reports, acts like 99.999 percent every RNA virus contracted vacinated one strain memory immune cells protect you.

On flip side - RNA virus likely mutate require new vaccine let God decide give lung damage He's INTP. INTP's necessarily want sorts physical possessions. try get rich worry money spend time thinking solving abstract problems.

Once get rich get bored longer know realize start solving worlds problems fun. Life risk, risk necessary.

Don‚Äôt bring New Zealand logic. There‚Äôs zero community transmission. cases caught border. That's cool all, thought building circulating air everyone else restaurant breathed exhaled onto restaurant something feel comfortable doing. importantly, I'm going trust health well-being someone myself. 


Unless I'm taking food to-go, setting foot restaurant long time. get restaurant food's ready, wait outside. Dinosaurs bones fallen angels, Sunday school teacher told me.

Viruses devious mfers you‚Äôre going fine... doctors test CT scans cold flu patients they‚Äôd get similar findings. 

not trying downplay covid seems like extremely mild symptoms.

just take easy working month two you‚Äôll back normal. Honestly pretty shit. excited Wonder Woman release it. think rate I'll see Snyder cut first. Yes, did. Japanese people wore masks pandemic; different it. Wear masks, sanitize, cough people, live on. Japan handled well - America didn't.  Here's commercial Dude, viral meningitis joke. I'm glad get bacterial, still fun. jacked good six months so. covid back March (recovered without hospitalization) 3 months later still get tightness chest, ribcage muscle pains days difficulty taking deep breath. never issues got sick. sell filters put inside mask also really can't believe conversation going like week now.

Not every bidet yours. Way 50 million already caught it. 0.2% death means 100,000 deaths. America already 130,000 deaths date don‚Äôt know states Michigan, US working surgeries previously scheduled canceled. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôd define elective, like plastic surgery? knee replacement? Surgeries things like cancer taking place along, hospitals switched around clinics located. branch University Michigan hospital 25 minutes away Ann Arbor, MI designated ‚Äúclean hospital‚Äù. normally lot kids tonsillectomy‚Äôs there, reorganized preform cancer surgeries keep COVID-free possible. 

To knowledge clinics within UofM beginning reopen surgery dental offices MI open couple weeks. mom dental appointment get tooth repaired called canceled like hour behind due schedule many patients. 

I take insurance claims auto insurance lot customers tell would go near doctors office hospital right fear. sorry sister enslaved put cage. way idiot respected human being. fucked Japanese society be, one thing excel embracing selflessness putting needs community individual. Wearing masks normal never questioned restricting ""rights"". media starts compare flu theres 15 deaths... remember Ebola ting 1 american died people freaking out... 120k deaths? meeeh lets go party! Overall food probably negligible risk coronavirus vector. Everyone calibrates personal risk differently wanted put folks want support restaurants getting takeout worried risk.

There scientific basis assertion. CDC likes say ""there evidence food borne transmission."" means studies published topic know one way other. So, evidence cannot transmitted either.

What evidence coronaviruses transmitted via food. reason believe COVID different. also evidence COVID transmitted via surfaces. Food packaging came yet another surface.

So, infected cook wearing mask, wearing chin breathes food packages it, may easily catch it.  Maybe didn‚Äôt know sick got tested???? 

These peoples arguments stupid!  Wear fucking mask avoid people. hard this?  understand triggered stress. think mental health issues less sudden onset though, unless PTSD. I'm wondering obvious triggering event what's possibly chronic long term condition. üòÉhow would never choose permanent burden society. East Lansing, Michigan. 85 people contract Coronavirus one bar. gave blood week ago felt safe. Everyone masks people socially distant. true. areas largely unaffected, lockdown probably toughest outside China. And, apparently, seems worked - fingers crossed! Shut up. Said tinfoil white guy. shortness breath likely extreme anxiety. I've going feelings randomly months now, I'm sick. aaaaand... wrong :D

LOL What, expect trust *liberals*? stupid statement. CCP already complete control there, else would able extreme shutdown. Thai people Wah don‚Äôt shake hands greet also necessarily, especially prove negligence. There‚Äôs video people removing stickers. would significant step proving campaign organizers negligent. far biggest issue scary one report it. something similar turns case fucked biblical level. Dude, pneumonia January year. antibody test done, negative, wasn‚Äôt COVID. Got super sick week living absolute terror this. Working home 75% even though job essential really conducive WfH (I‚Äôm lab manager). I‚Äôve everything right, staying home, sanitizing, washing hands, go mask, social distancing. Still get sick. Fuck people think it‚Äôs fake. I‚Äôve albuterol since January getting it. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm never going able breath again. Someone wiped ass, someone fed stupid stomach, someone clothed worthless back.

Wish hadn't. door dining seems doable, keep tables spaced far apart, limit capacity time spent hour, staff must wear masks one people done eating required put mask back  Illinois put prison. Sorry American üòÇ started bartending (with restrictions) already getting hand even social distancing ""enforced"". say next week go full swing means full bar, gonna absolute shit show. crap working conditions tbh, 85¬∞f perpetually masks protocols etc logistical nightmare trying regular shit, even keep pace whole unmasked families roll expect level service experience. best given situation, dude seems like jumping gun bit. 

Kinda legit worried old people too. Horrible idea. Ask Sweden.

I'm willing sacrifice millions Americans herd immunity. made point. believe 90k cases, much more. chance worse US very, low based epidemiological reaction standpoint. person probably hurt someone else shortly. So, CDC lying us really 10 times number, 25 million far. also Lombardia that. Even trust China, enough data everywhere else showing do. weird ellipses prime r/oldpeoplefacebook material. would love anything go eat hot, fresh restaurant food. I‚Äôd love scrub high chair dinner once, let someone else mop damn floor scrape food toddler dropped.

But fuck shit, I‚Äôll cook home get takeout. worth risking family‚Äôs health right now. Maybe US government hired people sub. predicted whole pandemic provided much useful information months press conferences. Man lot changes affecting everyday way things.... right, people fly unless extremely necessary. Ah, one _americans_! Yikes. Okay never get ill, like.. NEVER.

But mid-January flu-like symptoms couple days, mum dad ill flu-like symptoms week.

I hot skin symptom exhaustion it, still able work. happened pre-lockdown scary Covid19 stories happened China.

Both parents convinced Covid cos ill time, I'm convinced.. seems like normal flu me. also feel like many Americans shit hygiene well. bars options. That‚Äôs scary, sometime March really sore throat, mild fever, runny nose, headache etc time saying weren‚Äôt symptoms. they‚Äôre saying symptoms. I‚Äôve times trouble breathing nowhere. period 3 days strenuous exercise whole chest ‚Äòtired‚Äô lack better way explaining it. couldn‚Äôt breathe sat down. Sometimes feel like there‚Äôs stuff chest throat, cough phlegm comes up. new things me. time wasn‚Äôt possible get tested unless hospital. absolutely do. username checks Agree. covid badly. lot damage organs. one tell permanent. I'm everything possible get back strength. worst thing know damage resolve. IQ pseudoscientific nonsense meant measure societal (typically Euro-American) idea intelligence. fact IQ tests studied for, call question legitimacy reliably used intelligence metric.

It's useful things, used universal metric intelligence i'm proud you! ill keep rooting finish We're getting quarantine, we? It‚Äôs frustrating. really don‚Äôt get it. long think major quarantine anyway? Two months? Six? isn‚Äôt stopping. viruses generally mutate become less pathogenic agree, Bars worst, mean going bar socialize first place can't compell disclosure HIPAA. accept people word (legally least). district taught wanted us register underlying conditions state would know many teachers may need stay digital. Counsel stopped dead tracks. meant something like Deltibtardiot, equally bad. NJ teachers wear them. Kids encouraged wear that's it. mean act hospitalizations going well. 

First come cases - come hospitalizations - come lonely deaths hospital rooms. 

I feel like Americans understand timing. Deaths likely start increasing sometime July. No, think we'll get New York level deaths unless thing really goes rails - week week drop (which depending tracker already stopped) deaths coming end sooner rather later. ""I CAN'T BREATHE"" --my eyebulbs

You're helping anything. making things worse. 

If think bad article, please help me.

This article starting circulate around corner social media I'm trying make sure worst information gets refuted best information. So, come reddit get help. downvoting ensures plea help seen effective refutation article.

The first two comment said: junk site nice site name. helpful. need . that's obvious post title reason declared skepticism!  I'm looking help actual refutation way DATA presented skew reader's perception reality.

If better subreddit solicit help I'd also appreciate directed there. Wow. upvote educating that. Thanks. definitely learned something today. Why? going forms logic rationality **pandemic** wife working daughter reading math since school closed months ago. already better expected end next school year.   mean really see data % positive rates, would classify cherry picking. 

The graphs they're using whole country, start back March testing widely unavaible. 

NY right positivity rate somewhere .9-2% daily. states high 20% still. 

So disingenuous two reasons: looks country whole sleep what's happening states wrong track states really well. 
And two, ofcourse positivity rate plummeted. went got tested symptoms safety precautions last week. March, impossible. People PNEUMONIA even get test unless 65. 

They use graph try explain away happening states like Texas Arizona. It‚Äôs hard say. roommate got sick covid-like symptoms tested negative beginning June &amp; thought odd it‚Äôs flu season all. guess you‚Äôll know gets test back. love restaurants. one since quarantine started march whenever was, miss lot.

Please remember that. Yeah except cooks support staff can't see kitchen wearing masks. brother went go eat Chicago mandatory masks. bartender brought food kitchen even mask on. soon got leave servers started pulling masks talking amongst other. They're temporarily inconvenienced millionaires. thought /Coronavirus, /regressive.

The point remains, though, numbers WA dropping, especially east. Back topic, understand east would want treated west. visiting Seattle time soon, even though numbers also dropping. Good luck that. kid brings home flu cold 10 times year.  US incapable strict lockdown, mask regulations, strick guidelines...no one listen govt. work's hours continue affected ""for quite while"" given recent increases cases. working home called back site due ""optics"" (tax-funded, everyone main work home). comply social distancing, hours cut keep people away cramped work spaces. government bothered control situation, situation possibly months July.

Second corgi's Please don‚Äôt take medical advice Dr Reddit Unfortunately US far many people lack disciple still think Covid-19 joke. wear mask go parties, bars etc. catch spread around themselves.

It seems like lot people 1 0. protests surely didn‚Äôt help contain virus. large number protesters responsible wore masks, effects decreased. However, protests soothed reduced understanding meaningful change coming top, would best around.

Just thoughts. glad protesters masking up. local school system offering choice upcoming school year:

* remote school;
* Tuesday, Wednesday school; Monday, Thursday, Friday remote; or
* Thursday, Friday school; Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday remote

I choosing remote school kid. understanding teachers similar choice 70% teachers choosing remote teachers.

I guess enough people go 2 in-school options, *might* work.

The big issue local school system faced COVID-19 schools overcrowded. think fall 2020, schools almost empty. feel missing point. R value multiplier look for. Netherlands low R value, America higher. Therefor go large groups little spread.

I know personally Japan lacks COVID tests..back March someone sister's office found positive.They tested worker room.(turned negative)Now new text coming out,I really wish resolved prevent spreading.(My sister fine) Perhaps able leverage finally get Medicaid type program. leaders failed protect us lead us properly contain it, millions Americans live long complications, need universal system care everyone... mother failed us, owe us, would arguemwnt v Ugh... south Texas, disappointing. certainly said eloquently myself, agree sentiment. wore mask, though would protect me, might protected someone else, seen wearing one, sight might encouraged another person also wear mask.

You might remember iron lungs, something required ling term effects different illness? 

Same game here. least sure ""herd immunity"" also mean 1% population erased virus 10-20% people top long term disabilities.

That factually wrong.

COVID-19 caused *one* virus, SARS-COV-2.

Why Europeans/North Americans like this?

My impression Australians, Kiwis, East Asians super apprehensive careful. Maybe not, people like would avoid them.
If airlines enforce mask ban, none face backlash wear masks.
If airlines allows maskless flying risk alienating large segment public, potentially years.

My anxiety spiked bad, reason leaving. panicked frozen time lol. texted family left told go. things could done make safer, like people wait cars outside forehand scanners mandating masks stay face, didn‚Äôt. would recommend anyone.

Does mean never leave house non-medical purposes? That's said call cops. sending message. rest idiot see someone got cops called refusing wear mask they'll think twice. kind dumb. can't ""fix culture"" point. matter responsible people seem be, usually take easy way.

So want enforce masks country that's used wearing (As western countries) need law. Make mandatory, Austria even got fined wear them. crass violations (like reporting get sick) fines got really heavy (As 1500‚Ç¨).

If country's leadership can't show way chance enforce anything. Wearing masks might responsible thing do, moment allowed wear gone. people think ""might still good idea"" immediately feel social pressure ones around wearing one (as grocery store. 20 people mask, pulled mine point). one saying anyone 100% safe. Stop goofy. could easily grab shots huge protest I‚Äôve point pretty much everyone wearing masks. Stop trying make bout ‚Äúfacts‚Äù wasn‚Äôt facts, bout personal experience comparison.

Idk, seems like overarching issue way Americans treat elderly general. Healthcare elderly care business. That's big part problem. no, go somewhere like CVS pick Florastore, Culturelle Align. made pharmaceutical companies, arn't fake ""natural health"" supplements. begin put good bacteria back gut. Florastore Culturelle particular survive antibiotics, kill good bacteria, ideal taken course. 

You also need cut forms sugar, sugar feeds bad bacteria gut. time begin notice difference. show crucial shut everything early. Southern regions mostly spared virus, quarantine allowed infected show symptoms asymptomatics stop contagious.

You would first person seriously screw liver kidneys experimenting medication! worse. does, yes. mask deniers basically negating suggests. governors opening far quickly.  daily deaths around 600 day even big increases cases. issue week there's good chance death rates start increasing, maybe even substantially really hope best. messaging 14 days [**2020-07-12 08:01:25 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-07-12%2008:01:25%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

We took seriously. Yeah, Italians follow rules wearing mask keeping distance, mask mandatory bars, locals, supermarkets etc. Also, air conditioning turned everywhere prevent spread. 

Our government, even perfect, great job keeping us informed made lots guidelines reopening safe manner. 

I hope second wave happen, it'll happen think somewhat prepared. gotta chill smh damage already done. get tested negative Covid Germany take flight e.g. Spain, Italy etc. 2 weeks. someone cares 2 weeks. even could get infected standing line get test negative test. People crazy vacation Germany. thing really hurting people here. would instantly die can‚Äôt get vacation year. Oh, make many predictions, made correct:

* would lockdowns Italy Europe (I predicted two Switzerland, Germain, France Spain)

* US would grow cases pro capita Italy (it twice more)

* UK would introduce lockdown

* Italy's reopening would fine

And especially see difference two charts:

 RemindMe! 2 weeks know makes sick less deaths, can't bad! /S Freedom responsibility. believe earth created mighty power? Holy chit got lost site hours. loved it. dam would work job Ya fucking say r/collapse regulariser lol realize insane run tests months pandemic? even possible shows little government done cares virus needs body evidence many independent sources support claim. It‚Äôs huge country 1.38 billion people. states even local regional level governments incredibly responsible aggressive testing, tracing isolation. compulsory 14 day quarantine domestic travel states. Everyone contact positive case also immediately put 14 day quarantine (or at-least that‚Äôs case state).
Other states let things go hell. overall resistance mask wearing social distancing. Still huge population odds you‚Äôll find idiots ruin things us. think damaging brain? think 16 MILLION people unable work?
Where numbers come from, seem pretty insane. saw thing. seems situation got relaxed since 10 days ago.

As try always drink outside meet one friend two, keep social distance try avoid weekends. Wear mask anytime drink even outside.

But honestly things back way before. Reduced capacity, staff masks, people respecting lines, people wearing masks inside general less physical contact.

It risky situation course worst think of. Young people drunk weekends crowded areas. sure something happen.
The point eradicate virus (it back even tourists) able contain small outbreak. cases one gets sick easier contact trace friends. live LA ALLOWED INSIDE TARGET/WALMART/RALPHS/TRADER JOES - store without mask. allowed inside. all.

Everywhere go count one hand people without mask usually youngins skateboards sidewalk. Everyone mask bus stops even jogging! 

Unless live suggest assume we‚Äôre bunch Karens - bitches live Orange County üòÇ

All joking aside don‚Äôt know LA people fucking area live taking shit seriously bitching wearing mask. Yakima 900 positives week. That's hospitalizations; that's positives. highly doubt they're hospital space. source Yours?

Benton county 261 new cases week; cases, hospitalizations. 6 beds whole county? call bullshit unless provide credible source. would argue people live area densely populated less economic advantages learn work together, rely one another learn value welfare neighbor. Indian culture also focused family education. know! Like they‚Äôre special walk extra feet. grateful fully capable walking extra feet!!! hates Americans Americans. 

I dont know, man. Theres least handful countries statement incorrect. UK easing lockdowns people mass flocking beaches. People going cram cinemas reopen. cases dotted place rather localised areas, we're going massive second wave peak. would they? fines aren‚Äôt steep every single one backwards ass idiots going vote - know exactly vote for. hope ""large majority"" head polls overwhelm idiot vote. Simple stupidity. Weren‚Äôt wrong wish speedy recovery. buddies understand wanna hang them, I'm 23. prayers bud! Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Paywall sigh Nearly exact scenario husband me. far apparent lingering effects. Thank writing that. I‚Äôm person replied to, makes feel better. I‚Äôm getting nervous everyone else, I‚Äôm glad one person didn‚Äôt say something frightening keeping TMC hospitalization report quit reporting base icu went 100% said growth continues surge capacity full July 7th. finally brought back overhaul changed says excepting icu patients. confusing. saying getting full interviews said wrong good. People book holiday still can't go around families houses...makes sense. gonna happen. 50% people even wear masks lmao Read article Good luck man, believe get better. sort understand it, developed panic disorder times. Even though case severe yours, partly understand strugles. calling unchecked exponential growth success seems incorrect. Countries test everyone severely low tests end badder. Uh, say they're great government... smart move them, that, they're good.

Source: I'm Hungarian (Orb√°n PM) partner Slovenian. Tribal casino. Dont ware mask smoking, drinking, chewing gum. 30-40% wear mask 15% dont wear nose. People tell hoax ask put mask on. Kinda nuts. actually love idea. hardbent freedom, also deal hard consequences come along high risk, antisocial behaviour Rule 1: always afraid. wonder too. fear mine read second episodes worse. Ironically, shingles mild (aside ruining life post-viral illness lol), little pain neuropathy anything after. definitely worries could get another bout though. Hopefully neither us ever get again! mean least he's one annoying people cooks babies public. good news! However, I‚Äôm anemic get iron infusions. Probably best time me... Sheldon Adelson Rupert Murdoch level evil  Feel free spend amount time see yourself, hard grasp. 

I've yet see I've legitimate reason wear mask, you? Gov opened way fast. get it. anti-mask Texas, I‚Äôm locked home Houston next month two.

The people realize masks HUGE part solution better. proven reduce spread 70%.

If Texas opened fast made mandatory wear masks, would locked Houston again... San Antonio yesterday.

And wouldn‚Äôt waits get tested went 15 mins weeks takes hours hours get tested. exploding cases.

The effects going lockdown going cause MANY people city become homeless, money food, many people die virus people cannot get hospital bed another illness would survivable able get bed.

Ambulances wait hour get someone hospital, per yesterday. increase.

So yes, get declaring victory opening fast part problem - root real problem everyone anti-mask.

Make sense?

I know several people fighting virus. scared shitless. families, children. Sick. Houston. wearing mask months something majority done doubt many unless mandated - end 2nd stay home order... else right back 3 months later matter slow fast open declaring yet another victory. believe President US taking responsibility strict lockdown. blamed &amp; shift responsibility governors state make rule lockdown reopen, places like Arizona there‚Äôs lockdown cases risen again, Florida reopened early caused cases rising now. Smh get downvoted highlighting lol. Yes, using existing vaccines tweaking them, safety existing vaccines already tested, causing lengthy process greatly reduced. course would still probably bow first round see happens, I‚Äôm still less skeptical others. Coronavirus going kill us all!!! Everything comment made shit pretend real. Eat bag dicks asshole Ha, stuff Methanol it... kill anyway. mean, didn‚Äôt NYC serology studies show death rate higher thought now? 

They found 21.2% NYC antibodies. 0.30% NYC died coronavirus. indicates death rate 1.4% CDC says .26%. I‚Äôm confused. TONS people protests weren‚Äôt masked &amp; people masks constantly adjusting them/removing talk/drink water. don‚Äôt understand didn‚Äôt contribute all. 

This must spread easily outside. probably go restaurants evet people dine even admit sick--that's mention servers underpaid going work sick can't afford miss one day management writing ponying money get Dr's note. Exactly this. faith government fuck I‚Äôd assume would told early don‚Äôt help you‚Äôre sick wear one harmful you‚Äôre increasing viral load whatever telling people maybe can‚Äôt keep news, yeah calling people stupid doesn‚Äôt help anything NYC board education schools facilities open care children. even future, people developed countries 30 years ago would look current US situation shocked. *As today, Maricopa officially outpaced statewide rate cases, per 100,000 pop first time.*

Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** 7-day avg continues rise, another time high 3-day total. cases ever added single day (3,858). Total cases: 73,908
- **Testing:** PCR testing remained around 15K again. 
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage went 11.4% 11.7% (based 509K tests, 6.6% low) average week 20% (based 46K cases, 19% last week). 
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations 3% (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients 1%. (Overall ICU bed usage stayed 87%). Ventilators use COVID shot considerably, nearly 10% (all time high). 

*Data Source: thank kind sir actually am. I'm sure choosing hill die n town. fucking crazy. whole county less 1000 cases, almost 8 9 percent come one weekend Harper's. absolute bullshit. live Hawaii, everyone wears masks inside public spaces. Stores let without them. even Karen tell put mask outside smoothie shop drinking damn smoothie. flew visit family mainland layover Dallas Airport swear 75% people wearing masks. Wisconsin, visiting family, I'd say see 50% people stores wearing them. kind BS statistics this. (Like texas) right? like people dying 6-inch swab nose  tell us run state!

Seriously, save time. listen... horrifying. still think playing season.  It‚Äôs comical. **P**iled **H**igher **D**eeper phrasing "" nearing 500k deaths worldwide. Spanish flu 675k."" directly comparing 500k worldwide covid deaths 675k American deaths without adding context clarification talking America all.

just next sentence American war deaths, imply previous sentence America. exactly do? get fear. part feels honestly. experts field seem agree following proper procedures. It‚Äôs really advances science plus huge global effort allowing move much faster past. evidence? first line written Azar refused tell much money allocated fund. ""HHS Secretary Alex Azar Azar declined specify much money would allotted help hospitals providing uncompensated care COVID-19 cases."" think print money pay bills ICU patients? Dream on! Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology. Imagine airborne HIV... Oh yes. 1984. favorite book time- seems interweaving Handmaids Tale coming life. It‚Äôs disturbing sickening. really sucks. lot Americans won‚Äôt able visit family Europe irresponsible Americans whole thing. really don‚Äôt see restriction lifting long time. Allegheny move green? I‚Äôm eastern PA moved Friday green. Husband living still like red phase minus occasional fast food/takeout. Corona - kill you, makes weaker. novel cold mortality rate .1% needs infect 500,000,000 people kill 500,000. Antibody study results would suggest infection rate 50-80x higher currently accepted. Considering worlds confirmed cases 10million... oh look. Thats exactly number deaths would expect multiple 10 million 50 divide 1000. Define ‚Äúsome.‚Äù idiots referring invented technology using insult entire nation

... fuck sorta handwavey point trying make? It‚Äôs damn smart country! 

This? everything seen America's response pandemic, *this* point? retarded something? usually ones opened back still ongoing widespread community transmission like US Iran did.

Does Germany fall camp? German outbreak sparks fresh local Perhaps, live Brooklyn mostly see people respecting mask regulations social distancing. see effective preventing spread active economy. $2,000,000,000,000,000 is! Bring probably excellent human late that, stabilizing transmission levels would disaster.

To actually force back R0 &lt;1, take shutdown. think deserves blame months prep unlike northeast prep time guinea pigs Italy isn‚Äôt lying. Civil protection apolitical. Lockdown, cases deaths drop, open back rise, lockdown again, 

It‚Äôs never ending cycle. government(s) around world plan place essentially overwhelm health system always plan. Sadly, people going die, going die regardless prolonged period time overwhelm system kind successful across globe. 

It‚Äôs trade choose lesser two evils C'mon people, let's work harder make 100!... Sample population error/dishonest responses sure. I'm sorry there's way.

Or people wear dangling ear chin nose counting among ""yes always wear one"" population. Technically true, also useless purposes, ma'am. anything virus do?! Wtf? Indoor dining needs stop, full stop, right now. literally tons stories coming every day even socially distant indoor dining spreading virus. needs stop...now. Rural urban? Hehe need chill pill, need bail people too. countries seem understand everybody needs help this, us done terrible job supporting lower end economy, probably effort force people back work video made &amp; edited explicitly people disagree mask wearers best source understand people aren‚Äôt wearing masks? 

Wouldn‚Äôt better source people anti mask willing give opinions respectfully articulately? heart stopped they're breathing. technically dead. Code Blue (typically referred code) attempt bring back death restart heart. quicker start CPR better. One successful intubation obtained continuously perform CPR time 2 minutes. there's plethora medications give. 

Many people code survive. Sadly every code I've ever participated resulted failure resuscitate (return heart beat)

Typically 15 minutes prognosis poor. they're brought back probably severely brain damaged brain dead. family say long perform code, tell us stop stop. I've code lasted 1 hour family refused let us stop.

The code team (ICU nurses specifically trained respond code, RT, Pharmacist, Resident) knows what's going typically take control arrival allows floor staff minus return patients floor. Either patient pass get heart beat back code ran rush ICU intensive care. Something like 1/3rd parents today plan keeping kids home fall. US cannot get control outbreak then, suspect number rise. would crucial regularly check positive patients health progresses Damn, sucks. I've people say carrying something instead boyfriend all. can't imagine much must suck guy getting sorts comments. Poor guy! sounds like supportive wife though, I'm sure highly grateful! :) Like many things country seems urban/suburban vs rural thing. life, lives loved ones well. expect nation poor safety-net convinced lie they're 'temporarily-embarrassed billonnaires' need work harder make dreams come too? Well, experience contribute anything tell get info it. 

Gimme break dude, woken still it. tried help apparently enough give you, stranger, 100% effort energy instead politely telling Google (a easy way get non subjective info need), instead admonishing asshole saying takes energy Google it. Lol. Believe life getting back normal there. US, normal may still months ahead. mean stuff actually matters people. Believing matter. Suck risk lives people don‚Äôt even want wear masks? Nah. Bingo need Mission accomplished banner next press conference need PPE, including n95 face shields truly vulnerable faculty. 

If can‚Äôt provided, shouldn‚Äôt expected teach last sundays:

june 21: 3494

june 14: 2016

june 7: We're together Somehow DeSantis spin number win since it‚Äôs less either last two days. What‚Äôs role humidity? transport air droplets would moist environments preferable? Yes. infection spreads ppl get fight recover, coupled improved knowledge, hopefully lose less less. Arizona, cases risen 250% far June set record daily increases seven Pelosi... told ABC News Sunday mandating use masks across country long overdue

Uhm need mask. Hold butts opened schools South Africa. simply, disaster. refuse see writing wall. Parents pissed keeping kids school can, government keeps doubling down. idea honest. doesn‚Äôt change position wanting see long term effects, someone else guinea pigs. Evolution. Exactly, people stayed home curfews looting riots, stopped spike occurring. True. coronaviruses fizzled out. one every biotech company planet looking cure it. I'm debate justified protest. point led cases. Game over. actually one voted m***********, change incessant a****** That's worst thing MS, think starts waaayyy earlier says literature. years years felt weird, fatigued, deteriorated. symptoms, explained doctor, made assume depression.

I depression before, told that, said feels different depression. Still, complain tired, feel strange sick, feel like cognition going downhill, doctor assumes depression.

You get result body starts losing function. Many people lose sight, lost left hands grip strength ability tilt wrist upwards.

People forget sick, assume feel like everybody else. pretty tough. 6/25- 12.92% positive rate

6/26- 12.74%

6/27- 12.40%

So technically Florida better NY (45%) NJ (50%+) peak. That's listen science oof-brand stuff shelves nowadays know might it. live, minimum 8 weeks whole blood donations. reason average person takes 4 6 weeks replace miss red blood cells. Things like platelets plasma donations different time requirements donations. 

If mind sharing, medical condition requires frequent blood donations? \*Slaps tummy\* made this. !remindme 2 months American, surprised took long.. Even without covid19 large group people appeal me. course virus care. virus infect anyone comes contact without regard.

But people care. protests people wore masks cared lowering spread. protests people got tested attending could quarantine infected spread disease. protests, big crowds people top like would pre-pandemic protested. know hard see large photos, distancing within crowds.

At businesses reopen, customers give hard time wearing mask. People leaving shitty tips.

So yes, virus care. people care take measures decrease spread. I‚Äôm allowed risk life Chili‚Äôs? hella decide that. definitely cases case- I'm going pretend know science dad MS super classic case part. lots weird symptoms first mostly got brushed off, described ""lifesaver"" vision, eye doctors idea why. Turns common early symptom immune system attacks retinal nerve.

Then one day woke left half body totally paralyzed. Everyone assumed stroke first ton testing MRI's eventually diagnosed MS. lesions brain (which big part diagnosis), went classic relapsing-remitting symptoms years. would recover somewhat, get wheelchair months, one day he'd start feel described ""funky"" bam next days would go paralyzed back chair, often back hospital. first attack happened mid-late 30's, cycle went probably next 10 years.

But then, one day stopped. mean, recovered slowly attack, next one never came. 60, gone without major episode 15 years. really explainable, doctors look kind shrug. still scarring original attacks definitely never made back ""full"" normal self (he still hates heat certainly can't go run 5k anything like that). still days worse others. walk function normally, even golf (one favorite things together).

Sorry know one case I'm pretty sure myelin regrow (as relapsing remitting MS time). wish knew dad's attacks stopped; takes ton supplements back main MS drugs different periods time (Avonex, Rebif), stopped attacks weaned these. everything done online long enough, think municipalities greatly reduce number teachers. Constituents flip property taxes don‚Äôt drop also stay home &amp; work. think schools get past OSHA giving teachers appropriate PPE. teachers hate working PPE, get past legal challenges. I'm saying led covid cases. I'm saying least reason, educated risk assessment. Right-wing criticism acts once-in-generation protests police violence somehow excuse? vindicate? GOP's science denial reckless charge opening night clubs, bars, political rallies. that's complete bullshit. can't I'm gay..... also HIV lol I've pretty much given garbage-people. absolutely zero sympathy get incredibly sick die. They'll reap sow. quote Ivan Drago ""if die, die"".

It makes angry they're putting others risk though. Even someone it, wouldn‚Äôt difficult get outside you‚Äôre also socially distanced masks? Also, know risk 2 people touching ball Also people wearing would likely don‚Äôt take threat infection serious enough. would make group represented one place time group wears masks time likely home. Wow. Give man Nobel prize right now. mean Freud? leadership politicizes point media really shying away fact millennials zoomers ignoring face masks social distancing rules. one catching virus spreading them. age break data supports that.

The older's might screaming insanity facebook Fox News' comment section pretty sure home hunkering down. Unfortunately, yes. Lots people getting screwed. reason pandemic number one everyone's list disasters needed prepare for. negative consequences EVERYONE huge. authorities US fucked big time. family gets screwed. Let's hope vaccine quickly possible. missing point. subreddit quick brush claims it‚Äôs disagrees sake ‚Äúit hasn‚Äôt fully studied yet‚Äù, also quick promote claims agrees without said studies. It‚Äôs hypocrisy I‚Äôve ever seen it.

Feel free visit sites one cup tea. far know still freedom seek whatever information desire. teacher Oklahoma school, fearful fall bring. sent survey parents get opinions 100% school, 100% online, mix. parents want 100% school. know partly provide needed childcare service working parents. But, still shocked results. People keep mentioning lack PPE, lack space distance, lack adequate buses properly separate students, etc. Also worth noting stress put students teachers. Young kids work closely together. touch. share things. need move. teachers spend good portion day trying stop natural tendencies. know answer, quit thinking solve problem pre-pandemic terms. School going look different year maybe years come. Now, transition successful new model? Nice! definitely totally unbiased article CNN. great source! bUild wAlL aTlAnTiC Totally understand, looking starting point. set telemedicine call talk more. like gutless turd. Mouthy nothing add pussy. Europe open while. Germany official tracing app much better overall tracing programs plus solid testing. goes many European countries. Easy answer fire teachers hire new ones willing work earn living. Yeah well, people lied pollster then, 7% ass. expected, hospitalizations lag behind new case confirmations. real human rights violation government won‚Äôt stop sucking corporate dick help it‚Äôs people. 

I hear nothing this, instead it‚Äôs constant hysteria. People can‚Äôt afford stay inside months end aren‚Äôt enough safety nets. Can‚Äôt blame people trying feed families. 

Also people claiming never ending lockdowns way aren‚Äôt looking lens mental health, substance abuse general human well being. 

Just wait entire generation grows depths severe internet addiction coupled indoctrination causing fear fellow man. worse outcomes certain percentage population getting cough. Fine, Education then.

Includes IQ indoctrination.

Murica gud, commies bad Hey bill billionaires need pay taxes fund education system fight ignorance like this!!! I'd like see data much anyone else can't really compare two, privately owned hospital stopped publishing data website, like swarm ATF/FDA/FEMA agents stormed building, arrested staff, seized internal records. person's theory ""herd immunity"".  I'll pass whole refusal wear masks. problems teacher, taken locally. know teacher kind instruction online. Looked interviewed job Arkansas Red Cross. Arkansas Red Cross still blood drives read article Arkansas blood Institute, offshoot Oklahoma blood Institute. Google read articles millions executives make they‚Äôre profit. right. Reddit much less useful used be. 

But read screechingnand good info found.

Never ever care many votes get. use info. girlfriends kisses. impression almost colleges universities also ended remote learning, would professor complain? actually look really bad behaving like child. ""Covid cold"" immediately kills credibility have. End story. Seems totally doable. I‚Äôm sorry hear happened you. hope recover pathways reconnectüíìüíì. reasoning everyone going get eventually, get with. thinking might arguement made viral load - lowering viral load could make symptoms less severe, wearing masks gradually people getting sick would less dire. I‚Äôm trying think argument would help people think never get sick. even did, say wouldn‚Äôt care it‚Äôs inevitable. That‚Äôs exactly point. 

However, mostly anecdotal due diagnosed retreated bi-polar child correctly diagnosed adult ADHD, massive problem US Big Pharma publishing successful studies repressing unsuccessful ones. Gabapenten, antidepressants, even cannabis‚Ä¶if sift unpublished studies there‚Äôs lot contradictory information. It‚Äôs already happened hydrochloroquine COVID, it‚Äôs probably going continue happen. Well, mutate, people saying anti-body protection temporary?

Antibodies may present blood months, mean virus mutating. Also, antibodies gone mean immune system's memory cells proper information create antibodies again. Yes controlled substances carry risk abuse addiction. Even non controlled substances ‚Äî know coffee junkies. Doesn‚Äôt mean take aim particular diagnosis treatment diagnosis. Pain patients need pain meds, psych patients need psyche meds. world keeps turning. Canada's well also compared rest America's. long would take though? Let's take florida example quite badly. Yesterday 9500 infections population 21.48 millions, would take 6 years virus run though, that's assuming antibodies last long. lol rewatched April. Little know we'd rioting, too. thought everyone already agreed can't eradicate virus like this, keeps spreading seemingly erratically invisibly due traits.

It's especially impossible many world's large nations uncontrolled spread. US who's got problem, also Brazil, Russia, India. go away. Doubt less protection almost job except medical field opinion. build hospitals want. doesn‚Äôt mean shit don‚Äôt right staffing Pelosi acting like House's big pandemic plan mask mandate terrifies me.

She could using opportunity tell us next relief bill.

She could unveil federal plan containment response. going finance shutdown protect workers going continue slaughter? 

Instead, treating mask mandates though that's biggest challenge facing country.

Why opposition party useless. absolutely matters. You‚Äôre throwing effective numbers 90% 50% idea possible. That‚Äôs literally vaccine effectiveness means. According release Dallas Police Department, they're seeing increase domestic violence. stats February: 918 cases March: 1,169 cases April: 1,202 cases They‚Äôre already planning strategies ramp production modified MERS vaccine so.. perhaps chill. sooner rather later. entire sub needs get sun.  Oh man. terrible. it‚Äôs get heck lot worse. üò± Agree u/ AngryBeaver007

From detached perspective, Western Civilization generally glorifies efforts successes individuals. rewards shout loudest, boast often, display traits would diagnosed personality disorders (sociopath psychopath,) willing discard vulnerable members population weak/non-profitable. 

Its members detached sources true wealth: meaningful connection others, pursuit pleasure (passions,) time nature, spiritual practice, healing arts focus healing whole person, wisdom souls entering/exiting world. 

In general, collective good responsibilities individuals bear members society ignored even good circumstances. pandemic situation, good behavior goes window, people become emotionally destabilized focus survival.

 40000 infections - everything fine Whatever plans are, matter district, teachers going burdened loads extra bs coming school year.

The teacherfolk area likely double-duty, teaching person online. Lessons tailored environment, extra time needs coordinating, grading, managing attendance, onslaught parent administration emails. convoluting already overly convoluted system.

Maybe next round stimulus checks go teachers, maybe add extra aides interns assist. waves virus. 

COVID work way, sorry. ""waves"" occur result human behavior, like we're seeing right now. 7% time, lie time, so... wear p100 mask don‚Äôt die many douchebags around don‚Äôt protect regular masks. üññüò∑ Italy use criteria classifying deaths caused COVID-19 use US? 

Unless CDC changed guidance, anyone US dies, virus system, presumed died virus, even preexisting condition (ie stage four pancreatic cancer).

Does Italy approach way? Lol, looked America‚Äôs predicament yet? wonder person demanding everyone worked remotely, including CEOs get paid.

While rest world orange ongoing transmission without restrictions entry United States fair, even worse masks, means fuck closed space. state (ma) told districts need pay so. fucked. strongish Union. British government authority take away right bear arms.

I see lot people side eyeing giving dirty looks I'm mask. seen wearing lately spiking many don't. Awesome - thanks link. friends good communication aren‚Äôt total dicks. Personal responsibility contact tracing sorts.

I account every person spent 10 minutes contact since March 11th.

And give times I‚Äôve public shorter contacts mainly cashiers barriers plus masks situations. Could genetically weak virus rest us vaccinated fuck em. Perhaps rest world move forward without dead weight. fact either would open effectively genocide moment. Americans get stay first world country developing immunity generations everyone else rightly died plan. seems ad-hoc situation demands (both real political). I'm excited saw this, I'm open new Chiropractic Office Next week conservative area worried running stupid cards. I'm going print put door next one politely asks everyone please wear face masks. Yeah, China's collapsed again.

Are sure using word ""BAD"" way essentially ""GOOD""?

I've hearing 20 years, pretty boring, want rephrase it?

Born Beijing, stayed home entire Dragon Boat Festival, health everyone around me, especially daughter, seen month.

I seen month. symbol China's collapse eyes, that's funny. I'm talking Chinese people's mindset, cultural thing, Chinese government policy military issue. Btw, pretend like know don't. Yeah, operation warp speed website says Oxford vaccine may able start delivering October.

Again, grain salt, that's going first one Brazil tests go well. Fingers crossed. 

Every vaccine rush profit. let's place hopes one. Both, mostly pity. inequality mind-boggling. goal vaccine provoke antibody response response might last long. want hit bad. Cool. Easier way get vaccine. Enforcement another matter. utterly unsurprising. going piss delicate pro-plague constituency see action Europe insult. insult, one (collectively) richly deserve. Always wanted Vampire live forever.... I've worried us good now, wish I'd wrong . Well help settle bet friend. true assistant trailer park supervisors Nova Scotia allowed go shirtless? considerable effort part, thanks hangin' in! think Anti-vaxers generally unstable people.

That said, Moderna comes vaccine election - really doubt would take it. fear Trump would told say whether really safe not. I'm positive it, several months ago, I'm reasonably sure.

It far away sickest I've ever felt entire life. body aches bad sleep, nausea intense drink. Aren‚Äôt stopping Americans Canadian border too? Gave three reasons, many want?

Others gave more.

I can't teach read chart teach calendars work, may reason number five since weekend lag.

Have fun. can't wait trump butthurt Huh, I'm Canadian, wear mask everywhere go. issues controls contain spread. I'm saying believe numbers put out.

But congrats insulting random strangers internet, clearly winning life.  I'll take already gotten COVID-19 time vaccine becomes available EU Canada South Korea confirming vaccine safe effective. faith current US administration faith Americans wear masks, wash hands, stay home feel ill. view vaccine less-risky bet relying Americans. one trust everything companies like [Johnson &amp; do. excuse go douse baby powder. Yea reality works okay. fine stop people coming spreading virus. global pandemic filling hospitals stop people vacationing. plenty idiots, need stricter rules want stop people coming in.  You‚Äôre wrong.. it‚Äôs likely worth it. Especially since things home keep talking thinking might need use expensive equipment. never will. I‚Äôll cancel it.

Banning travel *entirely* order day.

The reason close airports country manage infections *known quantity*. There's point tackling disease re-infect everyone new strains people visiting. infection clearing (in Europe least) time manage risk Americans banned travel, Brazil Russia well. Saddens me. american in-laws supposed come over, met almost year.

Big sad. American, right banning us. How‚Äôs Japan days? way, isn‚Äôt everyone borders? Maybe want go Europe enter illegally, whine racism temerity try deport ass. Yeah, that‚Äôs right. haven‚Äôt seen while. weeks? Without preventative measures, exactly would ever stop? r/asablackman Hey fuckwit, I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm saying comments shitting Americans, gets pretty old people know right thing aren‚Äôt sick, yet everyone says Americans stupid.

But yeah outrageous. get paid much less net continental European countries, education good career much less rewarding.

It's low risk, also low reward. net wage inequality low Belgium, avenues catch people started wealthier. Catching possible moving higher risk, higher reward country. mean fetish true? guessed 6k would reported yesterday week ago boy wrong There‚Äôs total 10million confirmed infections. experts say could increase anywhere 5x 10x total number infected. Ofcourse anomalies.. everyone‚Äôs body immune system same. average age death 80+ Lol same. time blindness. side benefit I'm usually pretty happy live moment. forget crying coughing tear used riots. I'm sure people coughing COVID spread outside. /s 100 million actually. Corona tap last U.S. gets infection rates down.

Probably vaccine widespread distribution, since look like U.S. willing modify behavior. think missed point. watch bullshit walk whilst money talks.

SMH. People fucking idiots Floridian, nothing. People going beaches bars like usual. Things closed two weeks back March, shows got cancelled, everyone lost fucking mind get haircuts, go beach, go get drunk public. kept working work went half.

Weeks? surprised shit lasted years. damned travesty /r/SmellsLikeCabbage squatting eight year old account. Power internet. doubling now. I'd hedge bet next Saturday well report easily 10k possibly 15k + Wearing chin wearing properly? vaccine human coronavirus cause common colds one wanted waste time, SARS MERS burned research completed.  


There successful vaccines coronaviruses affect dogs (I believe) cats, like kind super-species virus that's impossible vaccinate against. are, doofuses Dyker Heights, Brooklyn argue wearing masks. swear, we're going end right back started knobs like this. think different levels irresponsibility. Ive dropped friendships people drink drive dont regret one bit. dad too. Trump really amped kind dormant abusive conspiracy nut him. got bad, disowned 2018. Texas finally closed bars restaurants still open 50% capacity. hate say (since waiter) restaurants open outdoor dining to-go.  curve means stop exponential growth virus manageable steady low level infection spread. It‚Äôs keep hospitals collapse.

Do Sweden exponential spread?

Have Swedens hospital collapse? Jokes them.. seemed finally figured stop mass shootings No, think person saying it‚Äôs partly racism drives vitriol China exactly US little criticism parties hand wringing China. It‚Äôs blatant. countries poor response many ways hid data, it‚Äôs easy see racism/xenophobia amplifying outcry China. 

For whatever reason calling unequal anger means you‚Äôre defending Chinese govt paid bot one could legitimately hold US Chinese govt equally accountable respective failures. used straight pass out. took years, worth work. One thing happen get older hospitalisations, IV. peak us. Nowhere, thought implied practically everyone was, since otherwise kind agreeing guy responding many young people though showing now.

If true cases NYC? seeing huge spikes Bronx Manhattan? argument simple -

Billionaires feed starving children bad.

You want talk level obligation I'm simply disinterested.

It unethical much wealth, afford eight homes area extreme poverty employed people afford none. Discriminating, insufficient even obsolete? Probably. Homophobic? No. 

Statistically random homosexual man higher probability hiv positive hetrosexual male.

The rule stands still safer without rule therefore think homophobic

I agree rules sophisticated allow monogamous men disallow hetrosexual men active non-safe sex life. Bolivia, alledged fraud, opposition prove coup. Schools ain't happening fall. Locally area, three children ten years old died week COVID. three zero pre-existing conditions. got week so, passed away.

And wanna open floodgates month? saw chart could 100,000 cases day USA Labor Day. Tucker FTW üòç fact doesn‚Äôt want close FL quarantine ridiculous. Oh definitely. thought certain institutions America couldn‚Äôt forced acquiesce political demands immediately interfere institution‚Äôs purpose. Welcome new America. I‚Äôm sure happening extent throughout American history, new norm seems overt corruption lies perpetrated without efforts hide what‚Äôs done. sad. I‚Äôll look right NYC: 90%, supermarkets, 100%. bars must close now! many people died!!! beach go long island secluded go first thing morning. There's one two people there. start show up, leave. Bruh wrote LEGAL immigrants. Hell, even kids cages six months since coronavirus started spreading U.S., public health officials continued stress one immune virus. Yet there's one group people still may getting message: cases spike states like Florida, Arizona Texas, younger people 20s, 30s 40s increasingly testing positive. Funny President Vice President giving opposite message tho Canadian, feel like saying name makes angry. omg! first thing I've ever agreed Pelosi. get downvoted. indeed said standing by. imagine forced change tune 4th july though. went something like well. big personality change, panic attacks nowhere, autoimmune type issues. sauerkraut kimchi may help people, often probiotics cannot reverse whatever immune metabolic changes went rails. gut ecosystem huge amount genetic variety, takes long time restore whole ecosystem gets wiped out. me, fasting immune modulators helped more. person different, there's unfortunately silver bullet dealing kind thing. 125,000 dead far. That's two vietnam wars (US casualties), months. expect memorial though. think name Donald banned day forward That's also gets flight pictures exposuring right wing nuts without masks flight - person taking picture plane all. truly believe everyone needs pull shit together flying. I'm 3 months basic af life see mate's traveling like MF they're mostly liberal (German btw). Would it? Last saw estimate 15% 20% NYC infected, nowhere near immunity. plot new confirmed cases graph clear distinct wave pattern. Claiming still wave one like claiming testing community spread. üôåüèºüôåüèº January first chance get real leadership, *don't* get then, next best chance relief wait vaccine and/or effective treatments prophylactics.

Assuming r√©gime manage complete bollox *that* up, moot point best. Oh shit. hope Q-Anon doesn‚Äôt find out. needs spread Bill Gates care much? mean disagree says, seems weird. connected pharmaceutical companies developing vaccine something? literally get far info US policy (or lack thereof) pandemic /r/p*litics. Also, would say people wear mask pharmacy either think it‚Äôs required (in many cases is), see risk higher say, Home Depot, obviously people mostly go pharmacies they‚Äôre sick. meds take. least 60% Texans sure. mean agree logic apply protests then?

What? That's right. Covid pretty clever virus  know point trying make. Paywall beach brooklyn. good 20 foot radius us others. Ok thanks clarifying, sorry tad bit confused Goners gonna go, dyers gonna die. Nothing much done stop that, friendo. next 2 weeks bigly numbers. Fingers crossed. Every thing learn virus scares more. Stay safe. Actually already know be.

According who? think overall learned less hazard seemed day one wen seemed like spikes. especially among young people likely attended protests although policy arent asking data lost.

I clue trying say here. NYC spike cases hospitalizations protests since start June. sub indeed liberal hivemind, like 99% reddit. Got good idea, would make mask less effective happy smart lawyer filed class action lawsuit FOX News its' role spreading sickness death. sued everything worth this. TV station responsibility. Part means spread disinformation kills people. Like, duh.  hope lawyer goes trial, wins, gets verdict $1 billion, FOX News folds. EU citizens allowed return home masker wont take vaccine long time passed. know actual track record first vaccines pretty horrible disease risk myslef protect relatively small.

the new MNRNA vaccine particularly worrisome base normal immune response attempts rewrite rna cell code evoke direct effect itself. town many people wear masks social pressure wear one otherwise you‚Äôll stand out. Lots people getting sick don‚Äôt care still refuse wear masks. Thankfully, us dual Canadian citizens fly Toronto Canadian passports. comes waves... depends mood weak ones Laughing internet points rn Masks required indoors here, especially restaurants. table must get (bathroom etc) new slogan legit ""keep america great"" We‚Äôre shithole country. ""The E.U.'s announcement incredibly disappointing, step wrong direction seek rebuild global economy,"" U.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President Public Affairs Policy Tori Emerson Barnes said. ""This unwelcome news, major negative implications economic recovery‚Äîparticularly ban results cycles retaliation, often case.""

But also, ban travel Europe United States, put place March 16, remains effect.

I would say US seems consistently show *""incredibly disappointing""*... US, people purporting represent way another, Executive Vice President Etcetera (but he's mostly certainly alone).

It seems hard fail see irony statement like US actually banning travel Europe, apparently, influential American, something can't explain happens, *can* fail see it.  mods see this, action pretty f-ed up.

We're basically back square 1 again.  3 months still remind people cover nose kind pathetic, people mask wear it.

The people see least likely one cops. Sorry Meatloaf He's right. Everyday Florida like purge young people running amok, burning, killing, looting, totally obey laws, oh wait that's true. Pass freaking statewide mask mandate shutdown bars large indoor venues start! sure he's afraid base? Seems like knows he's since one group without masks... Yeah, it‚Äôs going happen. sounds good right now, way trending suggests happening. numbers based per capita. Deaths per 1m residents

Well.. movie theaters still set open July?  Hahaha pandemic? Canada like 0.5% wear masks. Probably really need masks either far apart outside I'd still wear it. yeah gloves pretty much pointless friend got married yesterday. Given situation, invited closest family members, total 30 people.

During service, wore mask. reception, I'm assuming didn't, can't eat mask on. Afterwards danced together... masks.

My uncle died covid19 March. funeral, lockdown Spain. We'll funeral July 4. want go, wear mask stay corner, dunno, think it. cousins families stay drinks funeral 30 dinner together.

And later July they've organized lunch, 30+ people.

I understand. get wanting go out, man, I've going deserted places able take walk husband without mask. gatherings understand. aunts uncles 70s 80s; cousins' antics get aunts uncles killed! care?

I met parents since started, things better, wearing mask. love I'm risking lives. Fuck people's hubris, man. Covid patients spend time browsing web covid. web full conspiracy crazies telling people ventilators never needed whole thing fake experimenting people. weeks consuming that, start believing that.

Think people covid experiencing delirium, really think Bill Gates devil wants microchip everyone. 1 4 May NYC, mention rate recorded infected predicted way lower actual amount infected due everyone tested. Exactly. simple 3 phased plan removing COVID Texas follows:

1. Stop sharing 
2. Stop reporting
3. Silence

We currently phase 2 removal COVID-19 Texas. another month, magically disappear. won‚Äôt even hear word it. Imagine that. Gone. beautiful. /s least good left somewhere world. I‚Äôm thinking thing. course control young people do. willing use right incentives punishments, combination both. Casinos also fucked too. Even half capacity, hundreds waiting line outside together ones get follow safety guidelines. Well China gonna beat US 2-5 million. original comment said day camps outside safe children. children got Covid outside day camp I'm confused Meaning we're seeing headlines way often now...  remember electoral college play

Exactly. Trump win popular vote last time, either. Well perhaps companies politicians blame scientist whose work subverted? worse pre-internet. kid common belief lived United States government created HIV kill homosexuals Africans. internet needed. requested mail ballot. duty citizen get top shit now. You‚Äôre boring me, use thought, shouldn‚Äôt explain obvious implications. clearly I‚Äôm blaming people refused take measures prevent this, well government officials also failed take measures prevent it, healthcare systems failed prepare it.

Pool testing require test high sensitivity (low false negativity rate), though. One false negative - chances false negative principle higher diluting samples - affect entire pool. lucid functional 70-80+yo there, much many 30's 20's. Sure inevitable decay functions , aging you, keeping body mind shape require similar processes Source? Agreed think OP meant along lines ""front-line"" customer facing workers. help there's lot pressure wear masks. went sandwich shop two days ago. There's big sign door inside entry served wearing mask. Two three workers wearing mask chin protector third nose. There's three customers inside none masks. *smirked us* walked wearing masks. Subtle, pressure weird ones conforming there. Maybe will.

Rural villages South American pacific coast AC getting wrecked virus too. It‚Äôs plenty warm there, believe me. Well, yes basic science virus continue work way general population certain percentage infected, (prob around 70%). BUT... look trajectory virus taken many countries properly contained, clear effective ways lockdown reopen US. solutions exists, matter political get things done compliance citizenry keep safe. Unfortunately, shortage US continue worse many part world stop going conservative media like Fox News news science. confusion putting contaminated food mouth supposed dangerous, getting hands on/in mouth is. sounds like typical cannabis symptoms. read article wanted point observation forget.

Edit: Oh sweet another language. Well mayor actually jurisdiction strip. strip Clark county actually city Las Vegas jurisdiction despite middle it. second, she‚Äôs insane. agree. usually stop 32%, afraid people understand why. Exponential growth hard grasp. added one ""less realistic"" doubling would obvious wide swath redditors even glance referring ""some arbitrary minority Arizona"" instead ""very close end line"". tl;dr matter mathematical literacy. 

I also think something ""hard stop"" somewhere. percentage population living life ""going carefully twice week"" ""I year food basement"". easily spread percentage people. good grasp number 20% 50% even Arizona, right? higher? Since think last 1/3 going hard reach due behavioral differences, think (hypothetically) Arizona around 40% growth would linear exponential. (lotta swags number, know...) 

going kind hard verify since clear hospitalizations would force state intervene then.  3 million fewer votes. fuck ""take responsibility"" mean context? Embrace clearly incompetent leader shitty system technically declared victor? expect lose, went bed one night 2016 fully confident clinton would win woke surprised. wrong before. feasible keep things closed forever. point shutdown flatten curve undoubtedly happened. point eradicate virus, would impossible place like NY.

With said, think NY continue methodical reopening see much numbers go open different things (because numbers going unavoidable). also think need take account fact city get influx people coming back state left earlier pandemic. 7% live Florida me. Stupid fucks. Especially drink shower amirite? 

In seriousness, types things last reopen. amusement parks I‚Äôd even throw movie theaters. I‚Äôm pleased we‚Äôre handling leadership thing, governor took serious early people followed suit. It‚Äôs crazy read comments people southern states get dirty looks wearing masks, it‚Äôs exact opposite here. get dirty looks you‚Äôre wearing mask. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. one talking - leaders, reporters, scientists. think everyone denial long first wave continues. guy. OMG. He's funny. serious. live Florida Omg. words. think option recall state. [Well insist wearing masks unless sick well already knew better Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore. knew early January masks effective level. think dramatically underestimating time expense involved training 4-6 adults per classroom anything resembling appropriate levels skill. Appreciate it. said wasn‚Äôt shocked?
I‚Äôm medical field parents, deal life death daily whereas others may be. it‚Äôs great, aren‚Äôt United States, federal restrictions limited availability batch testing.

I also hope Ayn Ran burning seventh level hell. is, small amount, fault. No, ok live selfish prick, benefit postletize victimhood needing cooperate people... promoting society wide philosophy.    hypocrite... like people. Proclaim ultimate individual rights, found something called 'collective' plop head.  rofl Worst walked bar joke ever.

Seriously though, contagious saying extreme measures we've seen across world, anyone surprised?

We told months ago would happen. Since monday noticed lot people longer wearing masks neighborhood (west bronx). I'm worried cases spike back up. Disney World miniature town accommodations inclusivity needed make bubble concept work. also Ron DeSantis rolled red carpet NBA. fear corona getting long term complications. I'm nihilist. dont care people economy. Honestly, humanity due culling

I still wear mask, common fucking sense plague  sOuTh rIsE Alt title is: *""Pool testing could newest strategy battle coronavirus. Here‚Äôs works.""*

Full text mirror, anyone I'm debating you. debate.

That's works, obviously.

It's incredibly bad faith declare ""X debate said so"". frankly childish. life. Exactly. Went ice cream shop yesterday, 20/30 people there, 4 wearing masks plus employees, super concerned. executive kind true, people charge research (that still understand it) respected great deal. yeah, listen /r/conspiracy lol There‚Äôs going second round stimulus imo tons. 50% ""adjustment"" month later enough? Lol. figures gets checked central government adjusted regular. That's sometimes see discrepancies provencical submitted post adjustment figures course. seen Trump soon someone says COVID? fast. included /s comment. thing hear trump say time. ""There's way could known, one could seen coming......."" may common sense things. infuriating gets away Stop going TRUMP CRONIES information. made clear. happened masks? thought factories making millions week. hear news medical staff PPE millions mask Federal government took states go? responding post kids get sick time. one confused here?

It kinds cells nose vs. ones mouth. One foodservice union rules ‚Äúemployee must receive free meal every shift comparable value food served‚Äù restaurant mom worked at, big preshift family meal tried specials. worked $11 spend menu (which enough meal, basically fast food). 

It‚Äôs sad rule all, you‚Äôd think restaurant would want make sure employees fed work. Another sorta union job* free meals I‚Äôve never completely non-union restaurant.

*i wasn‚Äôt union employee others generally got benefits without paying dues. often 'sometimes' never folks stores compared always wear group?

 always wear mask, never go stores, pickup. group take seriously, exponentially causes damage gathering groups, ignoring preventative measures visiting public stores.

 come contact curbside pickup person week 2 households also pickup only, someone never wears mask makes handful shopping trips (grocery / big box / maybe mall) goes restaurant even bar. sudden exposing workers stores + patrons reckless individual.

Overly cautious person - 1 employee, 10 friends 
No mask / Reckless - close contact 30+ employees 50+ patrons basic shopping. 
(10 employees big box / grocery x 2 /week, 20 patrons , 1 meal (10 staff, 10 patrons)) clearly I'm pulling numbers thin air, serve illustration mask wearing people less likely contagious less likely spread less exposed public. reckless could easily 10x exposure likely contagious and/or become ill due behavior. Huh.i remember seeing mayor demanding opens, casinos saying no. Amazing month two change things.  God save him. saved kids prices. Right. Biggest cult world. Anyone still following Catholic Church ashamed selves. Seriously. unrelated court case argue \*weren't\* news station 'entertainment' channel? us jobs right now. bearly afford food let alone subscription newspaper mouthpiece Dick Cheney. 'Need stop now' ?  CAN'T stop now!

Even bum-fuck New Zealand, ain't nothing stopped. Delayed, maybe, stopped, never.

You love science? Well, here's natural selection coming way. Say bye-bye bad genes. Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position **charging hypocrisy** without directly refuting disproving argument.

From wikipedia page, emphasis cares Israelis think? wrong.

I care. think wrong arbiter right Sorry bro one arguing bad faith whole time.

Calling people unintelligent disagree much bad faith. ""only 7%"" yeah that's actually crazy high amount. Roughly 1 14 people say never one simple thing significantly reduce spread. many stores 14 people time. It‚Äôs proven fact everyone 40 never spoken cannot speak anyone 40. really hope helps curb spread, Pennsylvanians sacrificed country(complete lockdown 3 months) curb spread, keep control long play smart.

If drinking bar helps much, go ahead ban it, I'd rather drink home go back quarantine. Thamilomide wonder drug one point. think blind faith things dangerous. Probably give bars chance sell whatever spoil. 

Don‚Äôt agree it, may reason? think experts underestimate stupidity... look way, getting bunch angry misinformed people. think anybody tells automatically infringing rights. ignore rules laws follow, ignore fact wear clothing public law, stop red light. Nah want ignore say start government controlling completely. want ignore rest world did, better apparently ... sad part currently.. embarrassed country. must work 7%. article already covered that. 75% wearing outdoor, transmission negligible best seems, enough protection. Rolling back yellow seems absurd unless tell us economic activity caused whole 1% uptick cases 7 day period. heard also nowhere else could treated also know much situation. 

But I'll enjoy phase 2 reopening south enjoys phase 2 coronavirus waves. could help look good like, better job. Florida like week two behind Texas lot mirrored ways right now, DeSantis even came blamed damn kids spread virus much like Abbott week back Even happened Wuhan, Italy Spain, soil NYC, beyond words country still can‚Äôt learn happens spreads control. Northern NJ. Everybody, everywhere. rare see people without type face covering. undoubtedly related fact cannot enter public establishment without mask. matter going, need mask get there.   
And yes, hard hit, right bat, people never chance get heads far asses. can. Make governor. 24 hour shutdowns except Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar, shutdown indefinitely next phase reopening strictly bar, restaurant, bars supposed open Broward County yet. little ago Wisconsin, town used live named names seven bars positive cases pop up. Yeah scores big poor uneducated. people don‚Äôt never passports much less extra money go outside US even next state over. really doesn‚Äôt hurt them.  saying hospitals lying coronavirus patients died pneumonia. Even hospitals get bonus corona patient get. Okay Funny, think US sucks harder Australia European country I've to. Guess matter circumstances opinion... Lol okkk. lived Colorado since 1998(I‚Äôm 39) grandparents parents San Luis Valley homesteaders! seem nice though. think lot Texans act awful here. argument. lived rural NY life. Moved FL 4 years recommendation older boomer generation family members. hated it. every man himself, everyone selfish, self centered, entitled. It‚Äôs ideological breeding ground wealth division. Either poor driving Maserati. middle ground middle class.

 First chance got, moved back home town NY. real sense community here. Everybody thing respectfully. Need helping hand? stranger go way help out. Majority people friendly, aren‚Äôt, either planning moving Florida snow birds. thing happened Mississippi right cases spiked.. know explain care people. Packing now! FL gets New York's death toll people start taking virus seriously. need 100k deaths reach point, unfortunately... dishonest troll cunt understand matters. previous plans already backfired. think he'd ready right thing. regulatory logistical obstacles transferring patients temporary facilities standing relationship hospital, 

at point going need hospital workers public stand together insist simply breaking law. administrative regulatory obstacles ignored people would preventing able everyone sick core stuff situation take collective action.

&amp;#x200B;

that remove obstacles. logistics, going need fluid planning things become overwhelmed, obstacles things disobeyed + threat physically stopped disobeying mitigated numbers. *really* rich. Hi, question I've trying find answers online cant get straight one.

IF close contact positive confirmed Covid case, self quarantine beings 14 days exposure.

However, can't find is: symptomatic not, many days exposure get tested reliably get true result?

So, example, person exposed Postive Person B close contact Sunday. Therefore ""self quarantine"" lasts 14 days Sunday. person tested, whether symptomatic not? thought UK already opened restaurants bars. bad. One man instrumental that... I'm anti-vaxer. I'm skeptical vaccine somehow declared safe Donald Trump weeks election, anything less enthusiastic endorsement medical experts - vaxer. tries sell like last miracle cure I'll slow-vaxer. 


Ideally it'll developed abroad... ~~a couple of~~ 193 countries higher list US

FTFY know unpopular, could close factories down? least temporarily figure way prevent happening again. Trump take credit vaccine gets approved October. obvious reasons. someone post unpaywalled archive please, thanks. absolutely move money around capital operating budgets. Capital budget meant buying hardware, example. Capital buys laptop, let‚Äôs say. Operating budget primarily ongoing, monthly fees. instance would paying AWS‚Äôs monthly fees make laptop run safely school approved software, example. 

Institutions regularly shuttle money one way things like, paying whole year AWS monthly fees capital budget line item instead month month operating budget. 

TLDR; ever looks like money isn‚Äôt shuttled capital operating budgets. they‚Äôre claiming otherwise, they‚Äôre lying. combination gentrification banning leaded paint gasoline that. Lead makes dumb aggressive, desperartion poverty steal. Thank clarification. let anyone think ambiguity Oxford+AstraZeneca vaccine mRNA based. anyone read article cited would know break vaccine type every effort. hey, reads articles anyway? put mental fog exhausted, prior Covid well known. *puts soundtrack movie Singles* defer one year uni‚Äôs something like that, shouldn‚Äôt lose spot. much clear picture what‚Äôs going on. slowing spread virus making anti-mask crowd look like fools called local place said ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt implemented yet...‚Äù again, it‚Äôs goal hasn‚Äôt fully implemented. I‚Äôll stand findings. Here's solution, IDK said anywhere else. 

Let's say teacher 30 students class. 

You hire train 4-6 new temporary teachers. people could unemployed (we lot right now) go screening process. College degree required. They'll need basic training teaching, etc. 

What coordinate ""main teacher"" class. basically substitute teachers, provide assistance help academic level well, even specifically trained teacher. 

You split class evenly among teachers. could students meeting certain times school, maybe even scheduled webinars something like that. basic idea challenges teaching large amount students gets spread many capable adults coordinate administers teacher's lesson plan. 

Removes burden teacher, allows specific attention students academic figure trying times, gives people job. 

It would likely pretty costly endeavor, fucking USA. afford it, perfect stimulus package would absolutely positive net benefits. Oxford prob going done first probably look bats pangolins well, safe. Murica would actually need make plea this. correct answer spike cases ppl taking seriously, reopening early, ppl following guidelines bars such, also protests last time around Florida really even testing younger people. strict criteria testing young, otherwise health, suspected covid told ""yeah, might stay home 2 weeks"". Florida's tem.

Older people met testing criteria often. Meh, I'm concerned. Vaccine short supply initially long waiting lists. idiots want say no, I'm ok going right back line. one day sooner family get vaccinated. Sorry selfish, scientific idiocy punishment.  Honestly, feel ever posted social media hoax whatever, get insurance, gofundme. Face repercussions actions. They‚Äôre certainly something. laughed, cried think (minus people videos) grew little bit Masks mandatory every commercial retailer penalty $1,000 fine issued retailer failing enforce. Tomorrow 1 week since that's thing Harris county. Galena Park suburb mentioned article within Harris county. supporters, Florida weeks ago, they'd give dirty look wearing mask. seen ""a sheep"" wearing one maintaining social distance. made political kept saying nothing flu (meanwhile 10 million globally coronavirus half year, that's *with* masks/quarantine). automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Shutting needs solved. Something pushes platforms back dark. virus infect many naive people. keeping deaths low? better medical practices? lying? little both? Thanks. wish would make compulsory UK. I‚Äôd feel much better opening things again. It‚Äôs disaster waiting happen. government weak leaders. People need poor futures ruined protect small portion protect themselves.

Seems like one portion much selfish other. comes Devil himself. Donald,... That's odd, long ago sub thought 10 people beach (which outside) going cause grandma genocide. donated last week. Total time arrival leaving hour. Kinda boring, actually. Bring phone book. person stuck needle expert, bruising, needle mark already almost gone. Everyone wearing mask, stations waiting chairs set social distancing. say fun, bad. still point. FL one biggest summer vacation points America, you‚Äôve got amusement parks state doesn‚Äôt mean people won‚Äôt vacationing Florida even pandemic many average last couple years dying year alone. would venture guess bit less. chance someone access paywall post it? Really though! world... me, two reasons.

1. lot time they're putting risk, non-consenting children.
2. harming people can't vaccinated, vaccines less effective (allergies, immunodeficiency...). Herd immunity helps keep people safe, get vaccinated could provide breeding ground diseases fester mutate, putting risk. gets bad enough, virus mutate enough even healthy people got vaccinated risk. So, again, they're harming -- literally everyone else. Social distancing + high compliance means rules necessary effective results. wish family like that. nope. still give care. Me: ""Ha-ha, stupid Brits.""

Me (after reading American couple): ""D'oh!"" Honestly managed keep deaths low? Texas? better medical practice? lying? Both? idiots think safe reopening possible america? want something make possible. americans learn that. Wait, thought virus racist hurting black community, suddenly become immune exact opposite recommended safe? Yes, think reopening early definitely lead rapid increases cases new hot zones (as Phoenix native, totally see got are). think it‚Äôs naive think won‚Äôt spread protests. people claiming increase protests dumb piss off. protests won‚Äôt negligible effect cases imo. certain percentage

Self-reporting something like going produce flawed data. never true lockdown least live.

I think month strict lockdown would much better now. 

Jordan strict lockdown they‚Äôve done well. week extreme lockdown people couldn‚Äôt leave house government distributed food. week that, people could grocery shop 10 6 pm based license plate number car believe 

It chaotic didn‚Äôt work 100% would even harder US size they‚Äôve cases deaths. 

In US would bunch crazy people saying violated freedoms stuff think 2-4 weeks intense lockdown much better terms freedom months varying restrictions. Although don‚Äôt much faith government provide people situation like that

Something like + mask compliance would make way smaller issue I‚Äôve seen many people make false equivalence livelihoods lives, also badmouthing stimulus would make sure people fine things need shut down.


You find another job. stimulus get then. 

You can‚Äôt find another set lungs. comment removed said ""n p""

Anyway, yes affects individuals. Coughing people intentionally violates it. bioterrorism. com understand really quite fucked up. Wearing mask violate rights. Businesses also absolutely right deny service pertaining rules, likely includes wearing mask. Anyone denies true ""lib"". falling, rising certainly seem think that. think they're somehow ""enlightened"" they're ""scared sheep"" watched stupid Plandemic crap YouTube. believe it, look numbers.

I believe - know true. I've devoted studies/career field. grandparents, exaggregate blow things proportion.

Unfortunately, grandparents passed long Covid. yes - actually think docs, nurses, receptionists, hospital staff, pharmacists, 1st responders, moms, dads, grandparents, daughters, sons, brothers, sisters, cousins.......fast food restaurant staff, etc.

Watch footage average day ICU surge. then, something called *ICU delirium* - definitey deserves healthy imune system, worry

No. Everyone must worry sense cognisant mindful themselves, others well. Worrying something subjective though, Ymwv. this, implying healthy immune system means, one might contract it? *not* right, many cases folks even, pre-existing health conditions/young/*healthy immune systems* - caught - also died it. 

Anyhow - currently, there's surge...and country folks purposely fully aware implications actions. folks refused listen legitimate credentials. Regardless, might good time reflect without spreading fear, panic, etc. definitely worried, preventable.   Born raised Hudson Valley, looking wistfully back Texas. 

This news brought tear eye. Y‚Äôall keep up. 

But don‚Äôt re-elect Cuomo. Please? lockdown buy us time.

We already way behind cases started coming in.

The viruses primary vector person person public spaces. Therefore, idea slow spread keeping public areas clear people.

In time, ramp stockpiles masks, ventilators, medicine, testing equipment, come plans deal spike bound happen, couple dozen things needed done. Plus buys us weeks time toward ultimate goal vaccine.

Unfortunately, lockdown worked well despite hotspots, people assumed whole thing overblown overreaction completely safe go return work. 

Plus leadership issues decided maybe economy important lives. agitating similar viewpoints among populace state leaders.

So started reopening well have. testing place. everyone board behavior standards public. 

In nutshell, lockdown long enough seriously harm economy (despite weirdness stock market) long enough everything needed actually deal virus.

That means lockdown ended fairly worthless states take advantage time buy anything. really need arrest people put lockdown. sad recognize someone's username. proven wrong many times I'm sure many more. Dude, research believe ever chose military actually want lot money get. age tanks over. Yet we're still making abrahms. won‚Äôt able hide freezer trucks dead bodies. satire. percentage?

Biggly wiggly  Cool opinion, need perspective know joke 2020 Ohio, don‚Äôt universal lol stupid, *selfish*. laconic: breathe contaminated food, wrong. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs due politicians. Even without Fox News amplifying them, conspiracies bad information social media likely fault.

I‚Äôm sure stop that, maybe use Trumps exec order hold Facebook accountable pervading bad information. Idk. Several states 100% ICU record breaking daily new cases. NY locked 5000 daily people wearing masks. Florida past 10,000 daily many refusing masks. July 4th coming lockdown sight. Looks much worse march me. Bc literally every country establishing protocols. wasted it. going lock want hospitals run gonna hell time trying get people listen. party power fucked royally, deaths heads. people done great job virus.

The mask mandate, things already getting better, really pushed us side containing it- far remember pushback it. realize rural ideologically much different rural TX, think mandate gave cover people thought they‚Äôd look dumb weak wearing one. It‚Äôs lot harder feel ridiculous wearing one everyone else wearing too. 

It‚Äôs crazy people still get weird looks wearing though... think I‚Äôve seen one person gas station without it- didn‚Äôt even look funny, thought ‚Äúthis poor guy run milk forgot mask.. sucks‚Äù. didn‚Äôt even cross mind intentionally wearing it, it‚Äôs normal now.

Just final anecdote: Provincetown couple weekends ago.. crowd probably half I‚Äôd normally see EVERYONE wearing mask. Didn‚Äôt matter store, walking sidewalk, riding bike, walking alone parking lot. even mandate wear mask commercial street, there‚Äôs cops enforcing it. didn‚Äôt see anyone cited gesture times people weren‚Äôt covering nose around neck.

Generalizing here, know. LOL. You.are.making.shit.up. Cough money dude! mommy says throw money problem go away! That's literally headline article. lot kids got CFS/narcolepsy swine-flu vaccine, Pandemrix, Sweden. I'm anti-vaxer all, something fucked vaccine.

Made bit cautious newly developed vaccines. lot vaccines since though. all. I‚Äôm saying comes formulating public policy, there‚Äôs certain assumptions cannot make. would hope health officials take ‚Äúbetter safe sorry approach‚Äù, go worst case scenario (no vaccine).

So ask again, sir, assuming find vaccine, humans prepared social distance forever? people also seem forgotten HI virus Underreporting 'doing well' None whatsoever. spot single mask. Imagine abusive relationship someone (a woman matter) I‚Äôm making shit up.

You‚Äôre piece shit. long since recovered? feeling much better? fine want answer, I'm asking like hear answers directly people who've actually experience it. You‚Äôre right this. Rural hospitals (those them) going capacity quickly, capacity SMALL. moved larger systems.

People breathe, virus goes air, air goes air system, deactivate virus UV goes back suggesting UV also inefficient unless strong enough cause skin eye damage

I'll repeat lamps would obviously put people exposed. easy that.

As long okay, you, important person earth.

Literal childbrain here. Yes, mass protest BLM around world lead spikes new covid cases reason mask! believe many numbers floating around. Ah yes! ""For greater good""

Phrase sounds nice, saying ""For greater good"" put rights, fucking wrong. 

ANYTIME give rights, fucking up. giving rights ""For greater good"" deserve nothing less tyranny inviting.

Only one four know symptoms mild. Like common cold. others travelled car got tested. tested positive symptoms. One left protests people knows another car full people. There‚Äôs chance passed them. Always fly Delta!

We relied various levels government help us get mess.
For various reasons, unable give us hand holding need. quickly falling anarchy one help us. 
We many things need order recover mess.
1. Continue wear masks distance.
2. Inspire others follow suit.
3. Help people need whenever possible.

With #2 feel inspire simply countering mask protestors. Heck show protest front city hall, common good (mask wearers) stand across street much larger numbers drown thier babble.
Also like mentioned previous posts, advertising wearing masks telling real stories people sick lost loved ones. Post stories YouTube get media understand story, story survival.

BTW hear antimask protest town nearby, sure stand safe distance away counter (alone necessary) 
This bullshit got stop. Honestly California done thing, albeit bit slowly. governor threw conditions reopen window top county could request variances reopen meet lax requirements many have. Testing lead hospitalizations. Plus, would rather 5000 people go hospital knowing COVID 5000 people go hospital without knowing have? Social question, please put politics aside:

Let‚Äôs assume never find effective vaccine. mean physical socializing including: indoor dining, nightlife, clubs, bars, concerts done forever? - society - really going prohibit mid-large scale, physical social interactions? accept risk virus, like risk life, move on?   Yet say happen nyc ignored shut huge spike cases. Good job trying anything. didn‚Äôt help LA. That‚Äôs all. bad admit? Yeah screwed pooch Quebec. rates infection death long term care facilities disgusting. Guess wont flying then. No. He's human, gets treatment. Seriously what‚Äôs happening Florida? got vacation everyone‚Äôs taking abt it.. Damn really?

It's kind strange states kind grouped area done fairly well, far least, compared Ohio. felt like OH IL kind led states taking steps beginning area.  Maybe need start publicly tracking ""impaired"" cases separate count ""recovered"" cases. many people think dying means fine. - unless result ""contact tracing"" would one tested COVID showing symptoms ordered employer? Waste resources You‚Äôre first dude get it. asked simple question everyone assumed wouldn‚Äôt want save peoples lives. Awwww date nite *This is* Well then.... understand frustration.

I‚Äôm hope articles believe COVID patients protected. still awful. flu season, hard get bed hospital is. Anyone claiming go live actual third world country. survive month. can‚Äôt say same, that‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs harder get weed pandemic lol Anyone hospitalized virus look like that. people recover home. exactly? Yeah actually people can. thanks telling life allergies like. science this. Pulse oximeter nothing corona - device commonly used measure blood oxygen levels, within minutes

One major symptoms seen severe corona cases severe respiratory problems, reduces oxygen levels blood. Even without corona, people low blood oxygen levels vulnerable corona.

In order normal temperature checks, used pulse oxymeters detect suspected vulnerable cases, put quarantine prioritized testing. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt happen here!‚Äù

Nah, forget science, math, multiple prior examples. fine. covid manage wipe cells therefore lose ""memory"" fight it, happens enough times documented now

(it's also one reason people HIV cure yet) ELI5 take blood another 7 years used live Brazil, I've tried many times :( tested symptomatic people. affects people differently, extremely mild vast majority. Yes, big bang. Without /s! bloody /s supposed mean? China officially confirmed then. December 20th? Maybe definitely read something like ""neighbouring countries warn possible SARS outbreak Wuhan"" something like that. 30th official news started coming out. definitely pre-Christmas saw first rumours. KC MO here. people around like that. Mayor quick act February never many cases. Many hospitals mostly empty. metro area started creep last 3 weeks. could easily get hand within another 3, however finally instituted mask mandate indoor public spaces, help. breathe! controlled virus, like Western Europe. Many places people allowed leave house month without note. I‚Äôm allowed go outside everything closed down. Restaurants forced shut think 2nd weekend March, allowed open 1st June, less half capacity, max 30 people inside 1.5 meter maintained, 1.5 distance outside.

Everyone still working home. High schools allowed teach half full classes, teachers rotating rather students. Unis still online January. visitors sports least September 1st, events 100 people. couldn‚Äôt car 2 people unless one household 3 months. Closed borders countries places counties (I personally think that‚Äôs much prevents, alas)

Our governments large acted, maybe bit slow, EU countries stuff maintained it. US acted virus control NYC survived peak, completely forgoing fact 310 million people US hadn‚Äôt really experienced spike. What? guys don‚Äôt accumulation system?

COVID since recovered seem back normal. Like anything, would need see data numbers make opinion.

Still, wearing mask pretty easy done protect elderly. Time tell. still learning virus. stay, yes. develop effective vaccine, maybe. break occurs, people need learn live virus. Doctors nurses deal contagious diseases daily lives, yet rarely get sick. wear protective equipment. Time same. It‚Äôs going get much worse September. Cold weather, schools, concurrent flu season, aggressive return-to-the-office. First modafinil analogues change way liver processes lot different drugs shouldnt take without pharmacist checking possible drug interactions. 

The guy really high dose vyvanse. Dex also super addictive taking 2 3 times week makes wonder person even ADHD. vyvanse working worry it. ADHD prescribed stimulants while. think likely referring zombie affect. personality effect noticed vyvanse much likely seek pleasure inducing activities, like alcohol, video games ect. 

Most people know vyvanse take 20 40mg. supposed work way doses take everyday. Honestly someone taken stims years fact highest dose two addictive drugs ADHD takes times week tells probably chasing high get first start taking drug. second day suddenly taking high dose vyvanse get high would get physical mental effect come suddenly taking high dose. probably says take twice row side note Dex taken market country easy abuse. 

I take things mentioned. doubt helpful. valtrex sounds interesting. wanted take know people prescribed valtrex stop cold sores progressing spot early symptoms. guess way taking valtrex probably help you. 
Some people take low doses valtrex daily prevent cold sores think would helpful. talk doctor that. find want convince doctor prescribe label need come lot research. Sci hub help that. decide take advice guy drugbank help find drug interactions legal, illegal, research chemicals (what guy mentioned). Byzantine call pests emperor charge, so...

I'm saying totally disagree arguments, want point could heavily backfire long know people actually behave intended. ignore like prez said. lol. city can‚Äôt survive without tourism. course I‚Äôd love streets tourist free, works. Also, sooooo many international companies customer service based here, that‚Äôs really huge Spain. people don‚Äôt seem get this.

We've hearing ""August"" ""September"" ""October"" ""By end year."" etc.. believe Abbott test currently reliable commonly offered, area high prevelance according get positive result chances 92% Covid antibodies. test perfect, false negative rate swabs 20% get tested best day (3 days post symptoms onset), 100% get tested early, 67% get tested late (10 days symptoms onset) loss smell taste reliable sign Covid signs overlap less respiratory diseases. Take care guess flies Delta late game don‚Äôt require people read articles commenting. 
 
And probably lives Atlanta. use ilks excuses comparing US (trump) countries - bigger population, densely populated, states suppressing numbers....yada, yada, yada. I've heard reference couple times. from? City Council balls order shut down. Visiting Egypt now. Curfew single best thing happened three months trapped there. Well yes, EU made tons small countries. fair, easier control virus almost countries world (including democratic countries championing human rights) compared US.

I wonder why? sure. friend (precovid) would always pitch fit wanting go beach trip us spend barely time beach. Majority time spent bars, restaurants, shops ofc slammed people. sent us dark age Thanks keeping security lines bit shorter rest us. less credible say archeology instead paleontology Fuck Hostel Wai* yes, culture touchy-feely people pretty big personal space anyway, that's helped lot. LOL‚Äîwell server great job getting people food quickly. lot customers tired drunk mad me! remember reading huge ‚Äúflu‚Äù outbreak Italy January recorded flu, yet highest recorded.

Remember reading thinking wonder many cases included figures 100% this. Thai here, dust problem late 2019 definitely blessing disguise. fact country taking shit seriously. seen stranger's mouth months now. sure late Dec Jan. symptoms line up. Anyway, couple weeks recovered, driving mom‚Äôs house blocks mine. sudden absolutely idea was. Everything looked unfamiliar began panic. pulled subsided minute so. Looking back, 100% Covid syndrome symptom. stopped volunteering donation center March told allowed wear PPE. allow volunteers wear PPE, compliance enforced procedure donors upon entering building describe. way taking oral temperatures day, sitting (likely maskless) volunteers telling pandemic hoax.

Not that, temperature good method determine COVID19 positivity. Temperature continue taken medical staff, wearing appropriate PPE, rest vitals history taking, previously. Staff repeat temperature taking process anyway. risk exposure volunteers medical staff. I

It comes another example security theatre. 10/10 good job sire!! yard maybe? isolated area? beach unless family going ones what‚Äôs point mask get ocean gets wet anyway? masks compulsory public places Italy?  I'm talking concept video topic:

[Could Viruses I‚Äôve flown American 12 times last 3 months. recycled air planes like anyone else‚Äôs. You‚Äôre fool think ‚Äúno middle seat‚Äù rule saves anything. 
 
I‚Äôm sure United likes money though. Conveniently fact, course. 

People don‚Äôt panic happens someone know. Example: neighbor threw birthday bash, probably around ~30 people there. gonna like centuries. lose idiotic people. breed. beach Florida day. I‚Äôll let know I‚Äôm still alive 2 weeks hospital. ya beach fairly crowded. Unfortunately countries should‚Äôve listened affects countries too. It‚Äôs kind like someone said one kid ruining whole class. first wave never ended It‚Äôs updated removed ICU bed info. could argue may less important indicator shift patients areas, would surprised political pressure. [try orange India different strategy slums actually worked pretty well: I‚Äôve taken 40mg Adderall daily 15 years I‚Äôm fine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è G bad bot won‚Äôt work, British simply won‚Äôt abide rules know hundreds young people itching go Ibiza. won‚Äôt work Shuttering home unproven strategy fight virus though like ineffective strategy.

Is wearing mask rest life loving home answer? ever solved disease history time? haircut now, haircut forever!!! could design system could actually this, without completely new HVAC system including duct work etc. Third world country Gucci belt. love adderall really good daily drug, despite many doctors give fucking kids daily high dose. think - average age much younger round, morality rate lower. go eventually current trends continue lot time get things control approaches NY level crisis. That's real story. went Thailand Christmas break get masks even 4-year old son. Mask culture slowly built like 10 years ago boom Kpop common these. PM 2.5 dust shifted gear.

So, lucky timing Thailand.

I still masks bought pandemic came US I'm grateful that. Right. see Delta $50 flight. extra security knowing someone 2 feet away instead 1 worth it?
 
How often fly? 1 5 people may need hospitalized... spreading virus others violating human rights? shown ventilator mortality third. Considering ventilator mortality something like 80% before...it‚Äôs still high even steroid. guess eaten way worse living comorbidities petty issues like drinking bleach, claiming virus hoax people refusing wear masks because. Yup MIL well. we're living life sorry lol. sucks. Um, no, implication post walking past someone split second beach wouldn‚Äôt dangerous unless spray droplets face. Breathing definitely spread virus takes longer exposure guarantee infection.

So no, that‚Äôs saying. 

The article linked goes great detail, case studies, would like learn I‚Äôm talking about. means many employees makes 300 something proportionally make sense certainly lot assholes. 
I think best make sure positive examples shine brighter shun like assault rifle wielding idiots. Gothic representative whole Barcelona important specific here. Gothic hyperfocused towards tourism industry obviously affected. way, think good city taken back citizens expelled tourism now. Hungary. really pusses people barely took seriously beginning. it‚Äôs like never happened. Bars open full capacity, one wearing masks, etc. Fuck Info available r/COVID19 doctors/scientists are. It‚Äôs infuriating long it‚Äôs taken mass media report permanent organ damage (that shows x-rays types scans) CV19 infections, r/COVID19 running articles since March. Ask impossible task, please [follow too. We‚Äôve worked hard CT keep numbers low. Everyone wearing mask, everyone‚Äôs wearing mask since late March. 

I don‚Äôt want hard work undone idiotic southern states botched every decision since March. get distance sub. need virus caution, fear. Caution makes consider decisions think wiser approach, fear paralyzes makes unable consider things properly.

You want cautious, paralyzed fear panic attacks thing control first place.

I hope feel better soon. They're businesses closed, masks, minor interruptions caused lives. selfish. 

Until directly effects family member close friend problem. going get lot worse real attempts made get better.  Sorry late reply.

Cancer hell disease, lost grandpa that, glad recovered!

Thank you, really hope that's case, I'm everything fully recover. Mindset helps lot I'll start working mine on.

Thanks! average person develop symptoms 5 days, infectious 2 days symptom onset, would 3 days exposure. lot people longer incubation periods, recent study Tianjin says people also infectious earlier, may vary much. link studies interested. Austria could guessed infection rates rising again. winery long take masks become mandatory again. guess around mid July. MD basicly flat several weeks now. 300 400 cases per day, consistently 5% posative. [hmm, people Dont believe this. Thailand desperately needs tourists.. don‚Äôt see comment valid, honest. It‚Äôs pretty clear talking phrase ‚ÄúAssalam alaykum‚Äù, typical Arab greeting, ‚ÄúAl Quaeda‚Äù.

They even included ‚ÄúI wanna see manager‚Äù part, get confused??? entered. might able decipher anything. weekend lag. fear still weeks away peak I‚Äôll casting mine! US work sending hotspot, would probably want find another job. Yes, still 1000 beds available surge. interesting, TMC website removed ICU bed statistics charts completely 6/24 6/27 updates. 100% number 1. NY City likly 10k cases day early March long testing verify number idiots would rather die wearing goddamn mask

At least get wish. couple days old now. They're past 57k deaths help? Add statistics. people woul look death rate come conclusion affected (""I young enough"") take account might 10% chance ending crippled 30% less lung capacity rest live, least might decide worth risk bit careful. Depends state. states mentioned watch people die claiming hoax. Seriously? We're blaming things Russia again? 

Americans need take responsibility, we're dumb need much help. Face it. good way count 
People wear masks here, much know, Parties held. Unlock basically shops opening. live country terrible economy understand. Suddenly salaries cut 50% more, everything buy goes price, rent takes half salary, healthcare unaffordable, poverty homelessness increases, disease death much worse ilnneses increases.

So ... United States?

Being fearful pandemic damaging economy already even working people like worrying termites house fire. Found space contaminated rockets or....? absolutely right. thought much advancement Lymes, even though effecting people ticks' range spreads.

I fight like hell get month antibiotics treatment sick dog time. Tick apparently shared Lymes something else. community helpful official medical resources. vote called, divided largely racial lines. Black members voted masks, order prevent families losing six loved ones. White members voted masks, preserve fundamental right attach cloth face. person's page trip. Greatest hits include arguing actual microbiologist saying covid joke masks devil. Lol. thought he/she troll sadly grossly uninformed Gothic, touristic areas important economy residential areas. doctors seem concerned then? Nice try, due dangerously low amount testing done Covid-19. Read here: either way we're point 60% population going get infected matter right? deserved *pat pat* waste energy hawking masks preventive measure, hawk literally random pharmaceutical cure all? Every one countries far densely populated U.S. except Russia, Lord knows numbers accurate. Yup, this. Folks around wear masks go in. Thank goodness pickups I'd probably spend could go shop. Plus non grocery places pickups buy anything now. understand remote learning option every kid, I'm guessing young child? Distance learning dismal failure Kindergartener spring, basically every parent spoke felt way. SPED students district also get additional support need.

Remote learning certainly useful tool, cannot pretend equally effective 6-year-olds 16-year-olds. simply matter broadband device, question what's developmentally appropriate much independent learning reasonably expect. Philadelphia also phased ""code yellow"" June 5th (the week protests peak), meaning lot businesses reopened time. increase continues leads higher growth rate city, likely possible fully determine factor contributing increase most, especially protest-related trace data, mentioned article shared. Personally, considering extraordinary size duration protests Philly, would shocked see surge size result protests (after all, 88,000 cases Covid statewide). surge size would be, considering protest-related factors, idea. today, Philadelphia still sitting case growth rate less 1% (which lower rest PA whole, 1%). Putting perspective, 7 states entire country (50 plus Puerto Rico) case growth rate less 1% (Rhode Island, Connecticut, Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois). Maybe data updated Monday show significant upward trend. surprised that, things considered. Reopening *AND* protests pose risk, various degrees. 


I trust people far data science experience going try untangle analyze impact various factors. absolutely watching numbers carefully, try sort all. never said *hope* drowns fluids. said believe issue *is* drowning fluids. I'd sad best friend 18 years would get sick.

He's definitely dumbass though. He'd agree point, without question. think adjust too. beginning pandemic felt sick N95 wore long. Now, don‚Äôt notice go day I‚Äôm overheated. body adjust. Harpers East Lansing even begin try defend twisted use Bible. Bit I've actually seen comments made locally Facebook scarier, person.

There strand coming somewhere masks test see comply, part Democratic plot start tracking everyone, tracking, according extreme lines argument, actually mark beast, therefore masks either lead mark beast. people believe next step masks required ode tidy refused start stripping rights learn comply future.

N Utah certainly high. go stores (wearing mask), see 1 3 people also wearing mask. I'm hoping changes soon, plenty anti-mask sentiment here. Seems possible. .3% NYC ~26700.

There 30k repirted deaths New York State. Makes sense happen NYC Oh yeah, he's already tracked, he's giving anything willingly government. 

I understand single app encourage people download help tracing. I've heard many things, I'd get second, go many places getting good outdoor exercise. 

Maybe reopen bars restaurants app phone. 

Obviously would impossible, feel like extra hoops...

What talking about, neighbor thinks masks unfathomable burden he's freaking Patrick Henry resisting them. banned lot different Visas last tuesday. Greatest country history three years ago. paid employees throughout entire closure. choose call resorts perro dishes see would, business, wanted open allowed, need income balance expenses, obviously. 

Having said that, abided guidelines everything keep employees healthy. Could asked guests wear masks since opening? Sure, see wouldn‚Äôt want turn anyone away resorts strip not. BSing, including Costco trip. right island, make difficult. UK telling join

Would similar situation work drug? close CRISPR works? CDC one making vaccine US, private companies like J&amp;J, Moderna, GSK, etc. trial drugs work variety different ways, none anything CRISPR. companies, including Oxford, getting money government. would millions die? European, relief. allow foreigners, want parents coming US right risk infected always wear mask. Trust worth wearing one. Austrian ski resort early superspreader site European cases across six European countries traced back resort since March ‚Äî although reports said virus floating around Ischgl since theres absolutely way 7% i've barely seen anyone wearing masks whever go groceries you‚Äôre missing though country doesn‚Äôt cooperate, EC close internal borders even EU citizens wouldn‚Äôt flow freely country others.

Good lord Americans truly stupid country. ""Younger people"". mean ""protesters"". yet way kills far people  Ya exactly. Random idiot local grocery store going get anyone sick rest store people wearing masks. 

I think vaccine go way (if get vaccine). reliant anti-vaxers since enough people take vaccine herd immunity end COVID regions. Okay sarcasm. worried moment want put entire article headline? can‚Äôt imagine US top Queue China‚Äôs standpoint. 1.3 billion first, couple countries higher list US. DeSantis demanding apology critics last month, cant even make level human trash. mean indefinetly**... Look fuckin money got hand firing oversight bars Gavin, restaurants, spreading virus. owners put customers wont follow rules chokehold Protests! I'm Houston experience well, even new mandate. go essential things though, like groceries, taking cat vet, etc. employer us work home since March, except whose jobs can't done remotely.

But definitely decline mask usage grocery stores end April mid-June. we're city loves restaurants. lot people started eating first opportunity, I've read social distancing joke. FOMO ruined started pretty good effort here. like the.....movie........ Can‚Äôt spread virus don‚Äôt get sick first place.

Valved masks still decrease droplet radius. link article review found in? Thank Right thing happened NY Minneopolis days. increases sarcasm, florida flattened curve 9500 new cases 8500 new cases day, time reopen !! many pride festivals dnc festivals I‚Äôve seen. People aren‚Äôt scared those. 

Surely that, concerts, sports. 

Or    Ifferent. union ensure get due process.

They're defending stab child #2.

They're ensuring fired properly. short walk local Walmart proves report inaccurate. Good luck Pol Pot. they‚Äôre ordering $2 pretzel party 4, sat table 6 ft next closest party that‚Äôs fine. bars encourage people stand talk groups sit elbow elbow bar. bars reduced 25-50% capacity limited groups 4-6 people, spaced 6ft part won‚Äôt really problem it. pool, darts, bar games though.. governor also noted state‚Äôs ever-rising positivity rate, something FIU School Medicine infectious disease expert Dr. Aileen Marty explained obvious indication increased spread.

‚ÄúThat tells there‚Äôs increased transmission,‚Äù said Dr. Marty. ‚ÄúThis virus spreading almost ever instituted public health measures implemented. crime.‚Äù

Lock  wrong thread talking someone wants defund police. move along. Unlikely lot states counties dont report Sundays. Definitely think week first 50k day though. FWIW, friend friend call. Texas pretty much going back lockdown 4th. Abbott wants get 4oJ economic activity going back lockdown. One close friends that. didn‚Äôt want pay 25k online school decided work try next year. $$$$$$$$$ Georgia reporting. I'm lucky see half people store wear mask. go one county go 90% masks maybe 10%. 
It's literally fucking Russian roulette everyday go grocery shopping.

Example. stopped Costco gas. Normally wear mask pump gas there's lot people. Costco lines gas. single mask. even Costco gas attendant. wore mask sanitized hands frequently (the Costco attendant wiping pumps inside handle. point?!). GA fucked.... Indeed think protests contributed. caused. Like bars restaurants. 

But getting point - things day day, like bars protests whatever, long mask keep distance. That‚Äôs really crux everything right now. Cool. too! testing anyone else. Msot cases mild anyway. Take it? Hell, I‚Äôd take part trial, they‚Äôd let me! Yea human rights suckers. Welding people inside homes chasing streets China detaining using forcible extractions hearsay better response forgot /s ... hope least Boston heard anyone moan taxes much 

Get country hear lot tell works.

It works generations deliberate conditioning populace accept situation think normal.  living Southern California, far tell, numbers exactly reversed. better add /s case... aged sheltered world works

Self-Awareness phone, like little chat w/ you. thing is, none us know. Yeah, polls saying win, last time, too, even though current front-runner one ran last time.

But remember electoral college play, several governors/electoral supervisors key states rather suss. mention fact we're likely November midst *massive* outbreak nobody want go stand line vote, yet many states still expanding mail-in voting. Many probably close lot polling stations name public safety little remedy vote otherwise.

Even so, we're four months away. knows kind tragedies calamities befall us then, knowing year gone? Fair enough. live maybe 60/40 mask/no mask. 80% remotely possible. theory, using general, already fucked pre-game strategy. sort opening half capacity make sense bars try separate patrons Seems like common theme things spelled you. Well that‚Äôs relief! younger people definitely never come contact older people like parents grandparents. brother manager chili‚Äôs. 3 employees home sick rn awaiting test results.

Kinda hard numbers padded Gay men far largest carriers STD like HIV. make 70% cases small part population. takes donations towards making lasagnas. posts updates local group. amazing right across street even DIRTIER bar called Rick's that's basement literally always sticky. Idk even tried open back up, bars disease pits prior covid.

Pretty much none student aged population besides friends take corona seriously all. Frat houses huge parties every night quarantine always saw people walking parties like everything normal. Michigan set contained everyone immediately started hitting bars restaurants like day 1 allowed. definition, detention centers illegal crossings. Legal immigrants route authorized ports entry. 

And course kids would detention centers parents, else supposed go? go drunk driving kid tonight get arrested, guess locate child? Hint: back house. Ah yes, North South American policies Fatten Curve paying off. Whistle blowers screaming rooftops state this. People like worst world. Tons countries listened scientists got control safely reopen. Instead keep opening early shut back sacrificing hundred thousands lives.

 Death rate low hospitals dont get overwhelmed. Even doesnt kill someone still serious damage. Also same: 90% American male say wife satisfied, penis length average 12 inches, driver ever exceeds speed limit IQ average 250....


(I'm pretty sure better ways evaluate masks wearing asking people behave properly...) evidently different definition word ""poor""; anyone economic reasons choose going work proper supervision children poor. Dude listen scientist doctors. problem fixated government says. listed smart educated individuals. Shut up. work. get corona vacation. get money anyone. working lose miserable home. virus, sucks. Quit blaming everyone. Stop beating like dead fucking dog tied stake. see difference liberal conservative. right assholes ducks. Everything absolute. ready kill eachother.

Oh can't even support free speech 2nd amendment I'm labeled literal nazi white supremacist. whole free speech thing gets taken assholes too!!   I'm hoping won't, either. We've used planned capacity, though, we're trying plan unplanned. gym opened recently went 5am yesterday. 4 users owner. Two people wearing masks. Canceling tomorrow. worth risk.

My father going flying soon. terrifies more. feeling people remove masks plane. masks protect fellow person. wish people would realize this. morons follow king idiot. king idiot hold rallies, morons go spread virus. ""craziness INFP""

Typo? Live NYC, mask use incredibly wide spread. Sure it‚Äôs everyone time, general everyone takes wearing masks seriously.  first Gulf War ultra orthodox rabbis would walk streets scud missile attacks purposely wearing task masks. precisely. 

They used laugh moron chief. pity us Well first location protests started Minnesota. Protests started late may think? Hard say uptick even happened, anything looks like stayed constant. Keep going. reports yay. Right pointing feb getting called science denying lunatic. lie reasoning internally contradictory. 

The bigger indignity lying americans prevent us hoarding masks‚Äù purported reason wanting protect healthcare workers squandering time nothing go protect them. told buy masks, China instructed people buy masks ship back. 

So lied us reason never acted on- worst worlds. elderly people survive Covid-19? What's special them? understand young people underlying health conditions die elderly people, many 90+, manage survive? people believe see eyes. point already late. Hospitals **will** overrun, already happening. 

Take [current Arizona hospitals example... may blatantly wrong poll ever taken man.  budget high decided hire entire world crisis actors. Pretty clever. would fooled hadn‚Äôt watched YouTube video friend shared Facebook. think ignorance stops masks? Complaints portion sizes big enough, Complaints free refills soda, still racist, talk shit driving works, probably still mad people abroad dont speak English. Granted, every American way, point say fuck em, can't come. think batch testing. combine samples bunch different donations, test mixture. positive anything bad, throw away samples went batch. lying condition using blood donation way get tested extremely wasteful causes throw bunch uninfected samples along yours. Im N Brooklyn mask compliance 75-98% ...pretty good. sure destroy economy people‚Äôs lives. Yep. ope NC keeps handling well! missing point, cares people coming back. fact punishment fine. dissuade people coming ignoring risk fine spreading covid causing deaths. plenty idiots go one time put people risk. right saying enough stop people going getting people sick. think, perhaps, it‚Äôs necessary us occasionally stare abyss. Hope triggers change. not, well, guess it‚Äôs time move, turn news try live simple, enjoyable, life. best. could easily happen. know already artificial strains Bird Flu research labs transmit mammals (Ferrets). chosen oddly similar respiratory system humans. mutations introduced H5N1 virus genome, virus passed noses infected ferrets noses uninfected ones, repeated 10 times.[70] 10 passages H5N1 virus acquired ability transmission ferrets via aerosols respiratory papers Fouchier Kawaoka conclude entirely possible natural chain mutations could lead H5N1 virus acquiring capability airborne transmission mammals, H5N1 influenza pandemic would impossible.

If one strains got out, chain mutations replicated wild: we'd fucked. 

Honestly fact they're even research grossly irresponsible. way dangerous. lot people US still wearing masks April too, least I‚Äôm at. got tired now. got tired don‚Äôt care.

April around people first advised wear masks, less surprising ""still"" wearing right started. 

Then became political wear mask, many people subsequently refused politics, masks use plummeted result US. think instead ""weeks"" meant ""years"" anybody surprised? always interesting redditors assume person expert expertise even needed general analysis.. clue world he‚Äôs living in. lost like third sentence forgetting slow test turnaround time due overwhelmed system. easily looking 3-10 days result. man hotel office space business. Two lines business get slaughtered proper response pandemic.  Luckily governors arent leaving individual make right choice. Well, die whatever want body, care. Excavator welcome. signed entire wealth. Well first location protests started Minnesota. Location George Floyd death. Protests started late may think? Hard say uptick even happened, anything looks like stayed constant. Deaths lag hospitalizations like four weeks, least. I'm pretty sure unstated policy along Ahh yes... Like 'toxins,' I'll replace 'Deep State' 'Devils' read it. lol

Ignoring fact someone used term also transcends race. second governor talked stages reopening people slowly stopped caring safe wearing mask. poll bogus. think lot people care and/or misled Fox politics all. would lungs full fluid number different viruses fuck bronchitis bad case flu mom covid she‚Äôs 61 she‚Äôs fucking fine friend fucking cough fine. wish could upgrade sane. surprise Ok bad, point still stands though, live flooded British tourists soon. designed treat MERS, realised works covid-19 well. junk answers typically downvoted. got question, followed numerous answers sub like this, typically get couple educated answers. Also, people often provide links evidence.

I mean, question like this, opinions irrelevant anyway. 

But either way, see asking question subreddit dedicated Coronavirus *about* Coronavirus counts ""not research"". Dual citizenship US means one grand parents certain country. 18 must claim right US consider it, parent home country mostly accept upon review. NY stop virus infected people coming state?

You're treating races whole. absolutely dumb black people refusing wear masks. looks like Tennessee going report number cases tasks unplanned outage, that's never good sign They‚Äôre (mostly) even Swedes man, trolls. think lot people struggle rationalise 1% means large scale. isolation sounds tiny insignificant base actions that.

Personally, think FTC and/or FCC would way go. guidelines define television news done. Purposely lying significant issues/facts no-no. fine outside next people hundreds-thousands, chanting wearing mask...then allow large groups outside wearing mask. outside huge groups wearing mask simply mask. lot videos I've seen showed many even wearing mask. purely indoor virus? reason restrict outdoor activities masked up.

HOW TWO THINGS DIFFERENT?! valid not.

The cards fake. people carry it. used get every time saw one cousins turned carrier  Persistent activation NF-kB driven immune response probably behind many symptoms. NF-kB multiple functions, principal function control pathogens establish latency inside cells. However, also often chronically activated absence infection, giving rise many non communicable diseases, including risk factors severe COVID-19.

Activation NF-kB causes reactive oxygen species produced inside cells kill pathogens. long lasting, cell damage cell death may occur, giving rise various symptoms, depending cell type occurs. Another action downregulate receptors used pathogens enter cells, usually reduced expression, also desensitization sometimes antibody blockade. actions also occur absence infection.

One example disease caused receptor downregulation type 2 diabetes, caused reduced expression reduced sensitivity insulin receptor. Myasthenia gravis caused blockading antibodies acetylcholine NACH receptor.

Statins ACE inhibitors example cheap, commonly prescribed drugs damp NF-kB activation.

Funny think care coronavirus. really do. take every precaution going outside protect myself, family, around me. despise think COVID-19 ""hoax"", whatever. missing point though. exactly stopping older people work NBA getting coronavirus NBA season canceled? Sean Payton, head coach New Orleans Saints, got COVID-19 well NFL season ended (and thankfully recovered, that's point.) point older NBA coaches staff still easily get COVID-19 NBA canceled. Putting bubble, everybody tested negative twice COVID-19 arguably safer. Daily testing happen Orlando bubble, well physical distancing, mask wearing, Disney staff full PPE. support NBA's decision since looks like they're taking every precaution Orlando bubble. English Premier League United Kingdom turned success, thankfully lol control things, I'd consider asking someone live us make occasional cocktail. Unfortunately, we're one room short plan.

I agree mask wearing Japan almost definitely helped prevent spread virus. make good point US (in case Texas) would also yet unaccounted excess deaths. can‚Äôt speak well Texas testing - thought US stepped testing rate recent months would opposite strategy Japan, however admit haven‚Äôt really following Texas‚Äô measures. case, country active testing would provide comparable statistic. 
I also think bring good point SK Taiwan tracking virus means cases compared US aren‚Äôt mask usage vs mask usage, suppose they‚Äôre ideal comparisons either.

NYC population - 9 million give take. 

San Antonio new cases reported today - 795

NYC daily new cases height epidemic first wave (local NYC) - 5,000+ 

Comparative breakdown (daily new cases population)

San Antonio = .00053

NYC = .00055

If virus virulent NYC March April, great indication what's come. Many saying virus dangerous now. Hoping correct. wonder many lives could save governors stop putting covid patients nursing homes. That‚Äôs know it.

No... know that.

The way people philosophy define terms ‚ÄúNatural rights‚Äù- dependent laws customs particular culture government, universal inalienable

So right gun natural right, obviously. Many countries allow citizens guns, definition ""natural right"". Ok, downvoting post ridiculous. That's absolutely can, will, already happening. That's case numbers going up. People say ""its flu"" referring seasonal flu. Obviously one would say ""its like worst pandemic 20th century"" trying downplay COVID-19. one people traveling leisurely actually staying home. Got it. saying Bill Gates controls Department Defense? Except it‚Äôs real. grandma admitted hospital AZ testing positive covid19. Arizona near capacity, and. going triage life. memaw going die motherfuckers wouldn‚Äôt wear masks. I'll chip in. really it. many years server/bartender. think ruling class hour class serves them. mentality fucked up. fucked shit up. Doesn‚Äôt way certainly treat staff restaurants, sadly often done way. wear masks though. Heck, city relatively rural GA protest almost everyone wore masks! Masks mandatory every public space indoor outdoor spaces (crowded ones spaces can‚Äôt respect social distances). indoor 99% people (there always one person wearing mask wrong young kids wearing one) you‚Äôre wearing mask can‚Äôt enter public spaces like shops, bars, restaurants... 
And many people also wear outdoor, too. 
For example yesterday saw person bicycle wearing mask even tho it‚Äôs mandatory. Well, yeah. We‚Äôre 3-4 weeks work healthcare would expect you‚Äôre starting see cases protests. I‚Äôm saying we‚Äôre likely still couple days away least data really showing that. gradual uptrend last 1 1/2 - 2 weeks likely phase 1-2 openings places protests phase 3 opening cases either starting hit data hitting shortly (within 1-2 weeks). That's mean, student spends least hour room 150 students day. Five days week? Yeah going end badly. ridiculous think would. enough customers profitable. Either total shutdown government pays everyone's salaries vigorous testing campaign covers Americans really ways go. half-measures thing power keep trying going extend this. feel like reason criticizing protests may little fucking Look know would x case, hopefully we'd find middle ground somewhere there. Thanks laugh. HA! Maybe quarantine weak wear mask hour two. Outdoor bars okay-ish. outdoor restaurants. Sucks locations weather bad gather outdoors. 35k cases last day. Imagine Clinton President election year? hard imagine Senate passing anything. It‚Äôs $600 week, short time. $2400 month here. Plus unemployment minuscule, enough live on. need better unemployment. Well say data analytics, that‚Äôs exactly want do. I‚Äôm actually going school want sports data analyst. misworded making sound like I‚Äôd like athlete. 

My whole thing don‚Äôt want normalize simply normal way want live. don‚Äôt want distance self forever simply want sports crowds fans come back. 

I keep thinking sports never coming back. keep thinking countries thing control still don‚Äôt fans stadiums. 

My life literally revolves around sports quite honestly feel hopeless like I‚Äôm wasting time studying something may never get do. true, started ‚ÄúPERSONAL ANECDOTE:‚Äù referred disease maybe COVID. I‚Äôd also like point antibody tests 100%, especially given ones put market via FDA‚Äôs EUA. think biggest thing even protests didn‚Äôt lead lots cases directly, lead attitude ‚Äúwell thousands people gather crowd‚Äù (even pretty safe) ‚Äúwhy sitting house 24/7 nothing‚Äù ‚Äúwhy shouldn‚Äôt able eat outside restaurant‚Äù NY got 50% believe. many ppl flu year? many died pneumonia? coronavirus different others? inflate numbers liberal accounting standards? Sweden five US states get away lockdowns still excessive infection death rates?? 

I‚Äôm baffled everyone‚Äôs immediate complicity willingness shred US Constitution order cower fear virus whose efficacy less 1% CR (casualty rate). means long highly risk category, you‚Äôll stand 99.3 -99.7% chance surviving. You‚Äôre likely get injured living CHAZ/CHOP dying virus. It‚Äôs another mechanism control every last one supports buying it. 

Infections equal death. People bleach shots bleachers rally Alright, means nothing peoples' behavior. live NYC got tested first time yesterday. interact 1 person. dont go work do. 

There many variables make claim real data. I'm happy up-vote brought number up-votes comment 100.

I hope reaches 100,000. Obviously considering want murder people dangerous toy. Schools safe though! worries there...so really Aug 18th over. 14 day quarantine, fresh air, stay apart, disinfect everything alot, wash hands alot, sit serious talk virus also fears health. Let understand seriously harm you. Doesn‚Äôt seem so. Seems like wave either weaker strain else young people much lower fatality. surge started month ago enough time translate deaths. death rate declining even weekend. hope recover fully soon. 4 months! poor thing, can't even imagine. older coworkers. Interesting too, 40% pregnant women become infected end hospitalized. people normally lose jobs leave protest right something happens. jobs all. want government money kick back. Friends kick back. Bexar County shutting never told draw line.

(Yeah, yeah there's birds know mean.) Moo! Take NJ, cases peak 3-4 weeks \*full\* lockdown. Hospitalizations peak 1-2 weeks that, deaths 1-2 weeks hospitalization peaks. locked today going see peaks mid August. Hunker bad time. Since risk getting infected higher indoors, testing outdoors? stores: ask need get wait outside? Corona! I've country 6 times say 100% confidence way could test accurately. barely infrastructure set toilets.... suppose fact they're missing hundreds millions, billions, dollars tourism revenue anything headline.... That's nuts! Check reply thread, northern Illinois everyone wears mask indoors. mean **everyone**. can't remember last time grocery store saw someone wearing mask. Probably back early April, maybe even March. two American airlines flights today (work, unfortunately).

First one middle seat open, thank God, flight basically 90% full everyone lucky. Flight attendant said ""Failure wear mask ***may*** restrict future American Airline use"". Literally empty threat. couple Trump-humpers behind literally laughed poor woman making announcement. One joked thing mask prevents bad breath.

Second flight booked capacity saw flight attendant touching/interacting passenger... Neither facemask, enforcing shit all.

We're killing ourselves. I'm lucky I'm risk - far know. Oh yeah, like I've figured something unlocked mystery idea.  try write coherent sentences. lot family's Vietnam super worried heard outbreak turns safe pandemic! I'm glad Vietnam done extremely well.

So I‚Äôll wait antibody testing prevalent (I get tested virus without even symptoms don‚Äôt feel inclined test without symptoms known exposure). Thanks. Yeah would hard estimate numbers India COVID testing low available data skewed. sucks average Indian. Watch 13th Netflix. It‚Äôll clear question right you.

Wearing mask global pandemic basic IQ test. Constitution includes rights, sadly, responsibilities. Let's say two people:

Which person worse lung function? Well, that's correct federal level. Supreme Court ruled numerous times states free enact certain travel restrictions within across borders. recent examples many states implemented inter- intra-state travel bans requiring residents certain areas states enter mandatory quarantines cleared entry exit. travel bans and/or mandatory quarantines reintroduced, particularly states made real progress containing outbreaks (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut). astonishing quickly basic facts life gone unchanged unchallenged nearly entirety existence country swept wayside wake covid-19. Pence can‚Äôt even mutter word ‚Äúmask‚Äù save Mother. yeah antibodies lasting 2-3 months, unless you‚Äôre going get job relatively soon it‚Äôs bullshit make claim. Saw trump 2020 mask today. Maybe become norm. someone wearing maga hats still tell masks. one remembers cruise ships. deleted collective memory humanity already. 5% death rate! that's half confirmed cases resolved. able get 10% dude need add 2 3 zeros behind number China fudged one dangerous countries world visit.

It's okay. share concerns interacting grandparents, even though makes sense since leave property lol.

I get sentiment cause people become sick spread virus. lived concur situation US hospitals regarding elective surgery? places getting surgery lists others still suspended? thousands people remain agony waiting surgery rescheduled neighbours partying beach spreading virus further? That's mantra Texas.

Yea... one aged like milk. Thanks shedding light me, makes feel bit better. often drive beach go rides, bit shock. Take care yourself. Times uncertain, everyone's edge. 

 people want pretend happening, others worry obsessively everything. I'm sure, think alcoholism rise. see drunk people time Walgreens.

Like crises, people focus different aspects. people extremely worried layoffs. think underlying conflict causes aggressive behavior mask-wearing masks serve visual reminder pandemic, people dying cure. 

Others worry invisible germs, scrubbing sanitizer leaving store, entering car. hygiene rituals extensive. allow children even leave house. Exactly... we‚Äôve underreporting covid deaths cases globally. googled reports show tested .2% population. Would contribute? We've known since jan sister hasn‚Äôt suffered enough life. means fact already millions doses manufactured right now, haven‚Äôt finished testing them, says lot confident effectiveness. that's things going US. They're going able socially distance anyone make enough money keep lights on. 

NFL games expensive run. NBA, NHL. two totally inside there's way open safely all. NFL MLB could would play outdoor stadiums, sell, what, 25 percent capacity?

Are people soccer stadium going partake concesisons? pretzels? beer?

It political. insistence protests spreading events purely political. embarrassing people able admit people agree politically could also spreading virus. there's lot white people want call black people irresponsible things. terrifies forced back office. Gateway state? mean? Even rest world bad, isn‚Äôt, lame excuse strive better. literally linked article said large gatherings allowed Tawain again. moved goalposts third time ""no restrictions social gatherings"". I've already demonstrated countries large social gatherings, see need continue discussion. all. It‚Äôs symptom fact likely essential workers need keep working concentrated living situations. covid, H1N1 picnic. forgetful diminished sensation tongue. means sense taste speech bit dulled. consider lucky dialysis kidney failure. profits people number one excise hear people ""I get sick every time do""

Doesn't matter flu shot work way...they ardently believe does. $$$$$ certainly see 1 month surge death rate continues fall. significant.  Oof. Good luck, man. hope manage scoot past all. yeah, try using inspect female body see happens. actually don't.

But people challenge rules like people already said return lockdown. hate NYT never see articles article says data two years gives list positives. Seems like contradiction sorts title. people carrying declared protesting. say differently. muh phreedum hope think post agreeing you. I'm saying, China much better yes, probably loved methods. thoughts road trip New England Midwest states? traveling hotspots still apprehensive .. isn‚Äôt far though, looking rich nations lower populations give look mortality rate virus 

United Arab Emirates 47k cases 311 deaths 
Qatar 93k cases 110 deaths
Singapore 43k cases 26 deaths 

These countries able lot testing know virus mortality less 0.5 live UAE people know haven‚Äôt tested yet ,although one highest testing per million population suggests even missed quiet cases. It‚Äôs likely virus fatality rate closed 0.1% depending median age population. know well. Used work retail put college. change jobs often giving middle finger salute assholes company policies. Hey friend. work ICU survived last four months without getting infected. one know tested positive. Sanitize hands! Wear mask. I‚Äôm sorry deal anxiety happened staying home help healthcare workers?

Didn't hear? ""everything back normal muh freedoms virus hoax."" read study week ago said 10% lose antibodies month, 80% lose four months. Seemed like pretty reputable study.

 There's denying India collectivist US individualistic. 



That upsides downsides. pandemic, good. many ways, not. I‚Äôve seeing lots people Lake Merritt Oakland sans mask. damn virus spreads POC communities like wildfire. Wow! It‚Äôs spot on! appreciate effort done comment sadly give upvote Yeah well whoever said serving desirable job ? Eh, get benefits teaching people good manners. kids better behaved adults restaurants, they're young service job - young respectful, polite kind.

That said, maybe make form punishment known offenders. First all, covid SARS.

Of course not, intellectually dishonest want claim there's little meaningful relationship there. vaccine development prevention COVID-19 based SARS, pity's multiple doctors Italy USA attested virus appears become even less virulent past months.

Even assume that's true, depends strain become infected deaths Florida Texas don‚Äôt rise much next weeks, provide reasonable indication virus become less severe

No doesn't. South Korea less severe outcomes disease largely spread among young it‚Äôs important acknowledge risks disease, need reasonable it.

I never made statement People literally commented things like ‚Äúcovid-19 shave 20 years average human lifespan‚Äù.

I never defended that. making argument claims never There‚Äôs moderation scientific accuracy here, way r/COVID19, people able make ridiculous statements get away it.

""Not mention ‚Äúlasting lung organ damage!!!!!‚Äù comments people failed provide evidence present vast majority asymptomatic cases.""

You mean like this? consider comment contribution scientific discussion. weird way U.S. reacted pandemic way people hometown would react anything substance. 

If they're getting knowledge movies, would explain lot. TV movies mostly portray upper-middle class people, mostly prestigious cities. friends watch Supernatural? find much truer portrayal South Midwest; lots time highways, one especially nice house, fashion different, etc. Incidentally, family somewhat nomadic like main characters are. happen think late. Surprised Pikachu's everywhere. I've watched several dozen videos.

In every instance police using force saw rioting, protesters refusing lawful orders. peaceful slept thru riots? Yeah. first sentence says enough tests rest article talks testing Texas ‚Äî Mayor Steve Adler said Austin longer testing without COVID-19 symptoms currently enough tests number people seeking them. fucking mayor said welp, young people sudden started getting rates spiking"". 

Gee, fucking wonder why...can't quite put finger 2-3 weeks ago lol Maybe think Desantis intervene like Greg Abbott hair stylist Texas. Starting next week. Notices going out. tapped negative 200 long time. I'm hoping time it. humanity expected age First, cities big protests, whether reopened early. I'm Tampa. reopened early many protests. Second, many places started reopen weeks protests. People were/are protesting starting test positive counted. coming. Right we‚Äôre talking symptoms virus it‚Äôs contagiousness. point ‚Äúattacking brain‚Äù seems scary people image conjures different reality. idea talking about. Quit making FUD. Ah ok kind answers question. Like understand overall number cases gone down. wanted know better job treating it. Thanks, I‚Äôll look this. Vietnam thing contained But... thought lives mattered? Oh much worse that.

They purposely defunded lung repair therapy researching obviously critical millions home town doctors thought migraine... gave drip bouncing unconscious projectile vomiting. 

Still pretty lucky. bacterial cases, died, others lost limbs. Scary shit. really hope something goes effect July 4th. Mask culture huge Japan, wearing mask sick compromised already accepted children elderly brainer kinda. First world stuff guess state needs sales tax money. wife got tested today thinks allergies also, got tested case. healthcare luckily able set work. Mainly got fatigue sinus pressure hopefully allergies I've seen people say initial symptoms well. 

I came back Florida Monday symptoms, I'm hoping get sick can't get tested due symptoms we're going go test results. Yeah dad went church bit. went support recovery.

It possible? Yes, absolutely. young novel virus we're still learning about. yet seen data outdoors protests super spreader events.

I'm absolutely open seeing evidence events protests, we're month ""I need haircut"" protests 3+ weeks start BLM protests peer reviewed research subject lacking point.

It's one thing assume SHOULD, need evidence say does. point, evidence yet.

Give break. Stupidity cross generation America. boomers specific 'leaders' failing country. Why? lmao seen post history? I‚Äôm obviously US despite much wish could change that. Complete utter nonsense. Houston, Dallas, Miami, LA, Minneapolis experiencing huge jumps due protests. be. Yea, *that‚Äôs* said. Countries like Japan never locked kept numbers low could continue masks social distancing. Countries like US don‚Äôt adhere science would wait herd immunity deaths pain come that. Interestingly enough, data demographic cohorts lines rate violent crime.

So mentioned ""black folks"". compare black women, white men, think find? Well, white men killed cops far higher rates black women (and even close). based skin color, would possible?

Turns out, [it's white men commit violent crimes far higher rates black since greater predictor likelihood killed cops likelihood involved violent crime, lines up. 

Interestingly enough, even though 96% people killed cops **men** hear ""Male Lives Matter""... block person. happier. promise. christian? 

My mom always said dinosaurs trick devil test faith. southern states bet going away due summer heat.

Thanks üòâ need stop testing ASAP want drop numbers. How's mind? Ho ho ho, blamed BLM Trump rallying got deleted good, unbiased reddit! knew hatred lived validated somehow RIP Anyone looking facts far terrified February March now. true whether cared loss life economy. concur Cool. Gotta love security theater. Like Fl banned bars selling alcohol premise consumption.....but changed nothing regarding restaurants. bars try restaurants anyway liquor license significantly cheaper even bars area pretending they're restaurants. ""You drink much want need order food first"". Meanwhile officials sit act like passed rules made difference ""dont know could happened"" Interesting. I've noticed people's mask inflate deflate like mines I'm breathing. seems good fit even though bit small big head. move much part hoes chin moves up. biggest problem sweat can't breathe it. I'm thinking buying switch multiple times day. happens reach capacity Texas Florida others. start turning people away shipping coronavirus patients states yet capacity? Honest question far left black boog bois. It‚Äôs simply far right movement. would know anyway? I‚Äôm actually boog boi. believe would authority really changed view make seem severe. leave permanent lung damage scarring. may young healthy enough survive damn alone bad watched YouTube video chick explaining dinosaurs real. said archeologicals would dump bunch bones table tell scientists make dinosaur them. laughing realized people actually believe her. lol actually think would? restaurants bars lost ton money shutdown. actually think money purchase preventative equipment? actually afford turn away patrons point?!! also highly dependant available healthcare system well overloaded system is. Exactly. watch actual video bragging 99% corona reduction, it‚Äôs especially hilarious butcher fuck ‚Äúionizing‚Äù. Hard. I‚Äôm talking try pass word back forth yet neither get right. 

On one hand it‚Äôs hilarious, put lot people ignorantly direct risk. Churches super spreading events regular, church packed atleast 10X likely even usual hear dear leader speak kicked pair shit ants trying ensure people safe BS technology doesn‚Äôt exist. People need held accountable here, countless cases happen well lives lost this.  pizza place multiple violations...if can‚Äôt afford fine, continue take risk?! really moron lmfao really is. truly breaks heart makes feel ill time see proud people flaunt little care. 

What hell happened basic empathy? 

I hate much. really, really hope get make trip see great aunt. &lt;3 articles like serious media sources, here's another last week:

""The Enduring Grip Covid 19"" still take although try pick food delivery drivers breathe them.

 


I ask though. Assuming Covid19, spit someone's food. Would person get eat food? teen practically begging work local Olive Garden. Several friends worked thought it'd way possibly learn cook. Applied job denied experience food service industry. went applied bunch places including fast food never got single job. Even McDs hire me, prior food experience. 

I still day wish able least while. Extend lease X months? Pray tell interfering then. Hey! must know multiple PhD holding grandparents! sounds serious lol. got second degree. literally never gotten graduation. skipped high school graduation, graduated sophomore. literally got two degrees graduation cancelled both. mind, that‚Äôs smallest sacrifice make this, pretty privileged. Especially presented false information like headline. Wtf!? anything, us millennials taken serious. Fuck media drove Venice pick food (with face mask gloves) ‚Äî disgusted. Restaurants bars packed brim people laughing, dancing, zero face masks. looking like ghost buster get takeout. We‚Äôre fucked. Parkinsonism

Wow. idea was. That's fucking scary! Ah well. Guess stick another touch older man, never direct answers. Take care internet friend Let‚Äôs think rest Canada doesn‚Äôt also. Nobody admits problems Canada commonly infected people covid caucasians US europe. strain likely Italy. yet tons redneck morons Trump allow 1900 attacks US americans asian descent. victims nothing covid.

. isn‚Äôt even actual happiness though. It‚Äôs buying something new. Sure, listening music vinyl could bring happiness, hey, favorite album probably YouTube. 

Happiness small things like waking eating breakfast, loved ones, dog, whatever floats boat, don‚Äôt think material possessions way go, even temporary happiness. 

That consumerism. Protesting without social distancing masks even worse idea.  America much sound like foreign interference embarrassed live within control group. Vote November 3rd please. Japan Times article indicates potentially 1,000 excess deaths month April. Even attributed COVID-19 combined Tokyo's actual number COVID-19 deaths month April, still looks like NYC single days confirmed deaths.

So, even one draws worst inferences Japan, looks like /u/OuTLi3R28 basically correct concluding Japan far better US, perhaps due mask wearing.

South Korea Taiwan, case, good comparisons America assessing value mask-wearing, far extensive lockdowns test trace relative Japan. anything, Japan's lack testing bolsters utility comparison, long death numbers remotely accurate (noting, course, America plenty deaths excess normal well). u put head sand go away I‚Äôm understanding help. travel state can‚Äôt take sick leave. people can‚Äôt afford work go work sick. That's lot people dead =( Big breakout gay bars Strip, too. Pegasus (3?) bartenders test positive. There‚Äôs positive tested person also HIV+. studies showing virus effects population? Might want consider getting anti-fog spray, usually used ppe prevent that. happens awhile me, mask seals pretty well bad enough get myself. Latest news library professionals need quarantine returned books 3 days, 14 previously thought. want really safe use soap water alcohol disinfectants high touch areas things need right away, quarantine stuff. unpacking later next week. isn‚Äôt lol. temperature checks aren‚Äôt working either. know server w covid fever didn‚Äôt know get tested symptoms overwhelming. Dine should‚Äôve never opened. Pick fine everyone started going clubs maskless black. descriptive term. 

Relax. Oh get it, family went extremely bad year, add covid top it, things, hole may never recover from, financially, mentally physically. humans find way survive, life must go on. yet feel grip China. think we're assholes haha I'm sorry mom - I'm really hoping everything goes well guys!

It really infuriating. I'm tired watching numbers climb feeling like I'm crazy one recognizing major deal. think everyday cold way people acting. 

And get sick world sick. really do. yeah, essentially comfortable ""sacrifice"" people ever make lives. That's case people work essential workers - mean minimize hell they're living. us lucky enough work home? ability buy wear masks keep around us safe? 

I understand. Illness death suffering trump everything else. really should. instead we're stuck watching people make horrific ever needed care. 

Ugh. Thank comment, truly hope mom grandparents get head outside enjoy lives one day soon. &lt;3 Give little time... 1 5 United States. One 195 countries within world. even higher percentage population. yet 120k deaths. cops surely help. going go US change leadership vaccine found (and good luck convincing chuckle heads hate masks take vaccines). Nothing going change September. country hard headed remote possibility. Get ready long 2020.  pretty funny - guarantee many protesters 40-60 hour per week workers. Except aren't. asking, headaches worsen spinal tap? better laying down. probably case I'm asking abundance caution. Also political party holding indoor events stupid anti-mask types real toll 5 times that, least. growing exponentially opening soon (America). Talk black dude. different cop interactions. happy it. don‚Äôt want BLM. Oh man, sorry hear that. People need understand stuff. Yeah, asshole making point, entirely disregarded result. South Korea nightclub hopping super spreader too. posted reply message, feel sad mighty America admired, fallen depths. ridiculous all. COVID spread bunch people enclosed area yakking loudly breathing other's air. Like bars, hair salons, restaurants, birthday parties, bbqs uncles house - know, things crap states keep right doing. like assumption everything going orderly civilized this. interruptions food supply, everyone staying calm... Prediction: number deaths hit one million USA, there's going run Canadian Mexican borders. Slight pro lockdown, I‚Äôm eating wwwaaaaayyyyy better used to.

Even dropped 10 pounds. mention chicken pox, pretty mundane, follow act shingles, really awful disease. deserve graduation party was, also, much impossible get test age 65 there, so, accessibility test younger demographic may part that.
They keep trying point fingers, shift blame here.
Prior this, trying blame immigrant farmworkers surge positives, til someone end clapped back a. they‚Äôre simply even trying get tested, fear b. left state months ago, summer growing season move work. There's lot people media always talking everyone wants get back work that. hell lot people actually enjoyed break jobs. case kinda universal income get better. looking protests. think many young people. Georgia Alabama open two months things holding together,. coincidence major spike 3 weeks protests. Gentlemen...it privilege living .. Ah worries. It‚Äôs pretty incredible. ended living 25 years. norm me. know hard grandmother made things work. AEW t.p. actual paper trail... knew developed care strategies since late May really lowered death rate, part think. Poor NY NJ left guesswork guinea pigs benefit. Yes, already works Louisiana. Take care y'all. don‚Äôt think medical grade upper NY NYC two separate beasts.

Up state NY ok due lower density problems due different social dynamics. Upstate NY might well Kansas.

NYC fucked density advantage better social awareness. Next month, thousands law graduates take full two-day bar exams conference centers around country, rooms full 1,000+ people. Hundreds thousands people fly state take exam, use local public transportation stay hotels exam week. takes 10-12 weeks (7 days/week) study exam, they‚Äôve already studying two months pretty much guaranteed show test day even symptoms.

Some exam venues currently used overflow hospitals COVID testing sites. going utter shitshow. Ah yes blame young people forced back serving tacos hamburgers boomers I'm sorry. right all. alone Jfc 4 months?! viral meningitis five years ago, joke. major symptoms lasted three weeks (one week absolute hell, hospitalized completely it), another 4 weeks weakness neurological issues (shakiness example). still don‚Äôt remember lot time period, continue short term memory issues day. I‚Äôm sorry went four months. Awful. course do, persons business like home respect decision. particular case the. Haines every right impose whatever rules wish. needs many outweigh needs sick covind March three months. got it. Wife went back work, one wearing mask. caught day. pissed... sick sick again. Fuck people wear masks! duty field true, video good illustration. let people ride car without seat belt. (I lost youngest stepson six years ago driving without seat belt, ejected car flipped. imagine, strong feelings seat belts.) Maybe I'll switch analogy. :-) agree skeptical also don‚Äôt get data research direct cdc. However say close certain eating food doesn‚Äôt pose risk terms catching covid.

We don‚Äôt data indicates covid spreads orally. fact extremely unlikely virus spreads droplet enters cell ace2 receptor would also infect fecal oral route.

As commenter said calculate risk. terms eating restaurant food id say order risk 1. Talking delivery driver 2. washing hands touching packaging distant 3. eating food. okay? feels 

I give two shits 'feels'.

What fucking NUMBERS say? ** til vaccine Attacks anybody based ethnicity disgusting.  That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make hypothesis correct. know damage dude  I‚Äôm old enough üòâ Couldn‚Äôt least donate nursing homes? think agree covid serious matter.

Are certain political parties using covid benefit political agenda? Absolutely...

You remember, know lot covid early stages. Everyone went panic, even Trump, media obviously dislikes. went downplaying it, ordering GM companies mass produce ventilators drastic measures. probably saved thousands lives Drs learning turn covid patients stomachs rather backs. So, don‚Äôt think bodies staged. opinion.

I mean, you‚Äôre going lie deaths etc. get public scared, don‚Äôt think claiming 10,000 daily American deaths &amp; million deaths date would done lot better job scaring us shitless? (If agenda) 4% positive. actual f? objective falsehood

Can expand little maybe? first part true - testing skyrocketed. second part states ""little terms severe spike positive cases *as percentage tested*. qualifier problem think, no? think said false much misleading, no? Italians always first complain blame governnent. surely mistakes general since day one communication transparent, data make available github repository (also broke province province) starting march 2nd, people mostly respected lockdown. Even contact tracing app done free italian company, well written (source: android developer checked myself) every issue opened (even wordings) listened taken account. Even reopenings good balance starting soon possible (southern regions could opened early) economy (lombardy could waited longer) almost 4 weeks got right.

It's us stay safe ruin last months. hope fully recover. really scary disease arrived St Augustine, FL cross-country road trip (where avoided people, like, well, plague) last night find bars restaurants open, face masks, lots groups people milling drove hotel downtown. US lot pain way, I‚Äôm sure anyone anything avoid it. It‚Äôs pandemic perfect show us dysfunctional society become... One friends got back March... lost sense taste smell permanent lung damage. She‚Äôs mid twenties. Doctors thought senses would come back now... think might all. It‚Äôs 50k. Sonic probably best ""dine-in"" restaurant model pandemic. stupid repugnican Karens demanding see ICU managers.  feel sorry doctors nurses deal flood entitled conservative pricks surprised pikachu faces showing up. Theoretically yes unlikely

Your neighbour would first covid contagious window time.

Ventilators hospital vital filters. vent aerosol virus-meaning travels farther.

Covid it‚Äôs travels via respiratory droplets.

Your neighbour would breathing ac input. Droplets heavy. 

Much likely get shared doorknobs building entrance. Quoted article;

The emerging picture indicates model H.I.V. treatment, cocktail antiviral drugs, may good bet mild illnesses severely ill.

Some experts wondered antiviral treatment makes sense severely ill Covid-19 patients, main affliction immune system overreaction.

But virus directly causes immune system malfunction, Dr. Hayday said, antiviral makes sense ‚Äî perhaps even one, since it‚Äôs important stop infection depletes cells harms parts immune system.

‚ÄúI lost one ounce optimism,‚Äù Dr. Hayday said. Even without vaccine, foresees Covid-19 becoming manageable disease, controlled drugs act directly virus.

‚ÄúA vaccine would great,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúBut logistics global rollout challenging, it‚Äôs comforting think may depend one.‚Äù Maby dead within weeks. overpopulated anyway. job offering paid sick time, without confirmed diagnosis.

Please describe comically impared. is. I'm sorry normalised you. Trump Flu-20 someone asthma (already need take preventative inhaler twice daily) part makes getting covid terrifying. get chances I'll ICU long, even die lungs could permanently strike 2.

Thankfully live US. disappearing (N Ireland). tbh earlier life one learns lesson, better incorrect. Spanish flu example specifically killed many young people due cytokine storm. Stronger immune systems cause stronger reactions case. Yes, restaurants close fall winter determined. Never say never. Whatever, kind mask bullshit europe anyway. US tourists give fuck? Probably That's even remotely correct. 
Countries like Germany heavily reduced testing months ago already, since simply new cases overall positive rate low. 
When already lockdowns extensive contact tracing need mass testing simply anymore, Germany total tests entire US peak times. 
But go ahead pat back, US states reporting 30% positive rate US government clearly lost control situation cases keep going up, Europe Asia already mostly returned normal. 
For context Germany's positive rate 0.9% countries Asia 0.2-0.4%. lung capacity decreased dramatically since caught corona back March. I've isolating like champ, I've still go times month thing like laundry, buy certain things pick prescriptions. I've wearing mask everyone I've gone washing hands using alcohol gel I've started coughing again, dry cough comes goes throughout day. 

Either never completely recovered, caught again. Fingers crossed antibodies still go badly last time. ROFL Try Etsy! I'm one advocating idea. Ask are. Typical cliche response... about.... about.... Predictable good testing people high risk though. got got hotel.  certain extent done  current progress development new crown vaccine? able produce it? public concerned topic, reporter went Beijing Institute Biological Products May 29 first last time open Opened New Crown Vaccine Production Workshop. Since 30 May, workshop fully disinfected officially ready final preparations production.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ2 months Beijing, visit world's largest inactivated neo-crown vaccine production workshop

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAccording Liu Jingzhen, 2,000 people enrolled clinical trials, including Wuhan Institute Biology (Wuzhi County, Jiaozuo). (CDC) completed phase I/II total 1,000 people. Beijing Biological Institute (CDC Liangquan District, Shangqiu) completed enrollment 1,000 people total Phase I/II. help early launch new inactivated coronavirus vaccine, CDC also initiated internal voluntary vaccination.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe vaccine key factor winning battle new coronary epidemic China. However, many people worried new coronavirus mutates, vaccine development lose meaning?

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄYang Xiaoming, chairman China Bio, explained different levels virus mutation. Viruses true genetic mutations rare, minor mutations enough cause vaccine ineffectiveness. fact, said, evolution virus mutation complex, likely major mutation occur within days. inactivated full-virus vaccine developed China Biotechnology includes elements new coronavirus, even changes virus, would enough cause vaccine ineffective. Influences effectiveness vaccine.

It really sets tone rest article first sentence objective falsehood. black lives matter protests sure didnt help. Saw alot masks hit many without. fuck yall. America falling apart right front us....not foreign terrorist country, Fucking virus it! 

 hundred years building greatest nation, withstood several wars enemies came prosperous nation...all brought bunch idiots wont listen scientists say wear mask....meanwhile actual examples working sucessfully every fucking country. wearing mask makes sheep beyond me. 

Fuck everyone arent listening advice doctors prolonging lockdown kids.  listening wrong people. Hey man, super sucks, maybe start feel back feet physiotherapy re-training go get back running, believe you!

I COVID noticed real effects last week got pain kidney, since then, think I'm gonna make trip doctor's italy law same.
Inside masks mandatory outside cannot stay 1 meter away people.
The exception restaurants bars case wear mask seated cannot drinks unless sitting table. owners reduced capacity distance tables guaranteed. AC turned off. Smoking areas closed.

It also happened (not lot dinners lockdown know much common is) would put place extra safety measures groups sitting table living together. party four extra separator ""pairs"" additional (these optional) plexiglass separators. I‚Äôve watch county meeting Florida? invite citizens state mandating mask constitution Americans remarks every science facts pandemic Eek. More! Please! want add additional information opinion posted, that's fine, try paint like purposely ""omitting important details"". disengenuos best. Hmmmm  Seems like cause solution problem. literally responding think wrote.
I said spread virus, virus spreading way thought way lockdowns.
When first noticed r0 around 5 areas. think cases 10 mil either dillusional idea expotentional growth works. lucky. shoebox Payless live in. know women antibodies first positive test sickness. weeks got negative test also antibodies asked give blood. 12 weeks later she‚Äôs sick again, 2nd positive test antibodies. yet given conclusive answer new infection faulty test..or something else. She‚Äôs sick though. sick. doctor basically said, ‚Äúlet get back you‚Äù. loss everyday virus presents new piece itself. Ok maybe don‚Äôt flip government every week Haha. Please road trip though. live Canadian province 0 cases two weeks. doubt Americans coming. begs question giving remdesivir patients get-go might beneficial offering severe cases only?

Redesivir given intravenously currently given hospital. Apparently delivery options work remdesivir tried. ‚ÄúImbeciles‚Äù trying best person honor someone died decade ago miss every single day, easily better butt me, still... 
 
Would mind elaborating tail end that? Hey, read r/coronavirus too? Huh, wonder else uses sub I've flu middle Australian summers. certainly go away. Yea look deaths. know fact excess deaths Singapore. also know are/were mass graves last months Indonesia Sorry guys This! lot people grew Dharavi, want live even manage make money move different place. sense community feel area. COVID spread depends community action place may terrible sanitation scale, pretty high community cooperation Tbh Spaniards scared precisely Brits seem control. countries definitely done better job citizens seems conscious social distancing, masks hand cleaning. want every American reflect treating hundreds thousands dead virus compared treated 9/11 measily 3000 people died. gave freedoms, invaded countries, spent hundreds billions dollars, undermined democracy, made flying nightmare, one little blip. 120k+ Americans dead argue cost wear mask high prevent another hundred thousand Americans dying?

What happened country?

(I'm actually saying 3000 dead 9/11 insignificant, I'm saying according American logic 3000 dead insignificant 120k dead country really seem care about)

Edit: They're getting it, they're finally getting it. Welcome 3 months ago, Florida. Yeah. made mistake getting woke pee I'm wide awake angry!!!! hopeless anger know cannot anything myself, little ""family"" fine great meanwhile friends many others struggling. üò¢ Maaaaaybe eventually we'll move country. ü§î They‚Äôre going care ‚Äúrefutations‚Äù.

Well, let's give people idiots. mean, really go way actively discourage someone trying make sure best info COVID gets out? Guess - social media post, poster commenter get see content. Sometimes many, many people silently looking. I'm guy posted it, I'm people may read know think. 

‚ÄúThe thing necessary triumph evil good men nothing.‚Äù Hi Arizona thousands previous pandemics life long complications too. also stronger immune system today becouse that. think would happen brought back guy lived thousand year ago life walk around among us? He'd likely die new stuff immune system develop withstand. Don‚Äôt dramatic

Walking street gamble life
Waking gamble life Also flu caused multiple different viruses. I‚Äôm gonna add this. terrified boyfriend catching took plenty precautions. deliveries I‚Äôm pretty sure caught touching door handle something like that, gave me. Anyway, tested positive two weeks ago symptom loss smell taste. got fluctuating fever, head/body aches + sinus pressure, soooome shortness breath/chest discomfort loss smell. cough whatsoever. worst went away week. scary knowing gonna happen us....but we‚Äôre fine now. 
I‚Äôm still worried parents catching though! virus weird. Disturbing found short period time

Wonder discover next virus origins Wait country talking about? sweden anynplace packed damcefloor get shut authorities Huge loss revenue. Curb side go $4000 revenue every hour fully packed bar. Serving sales game, hire servers sell. Nothing sells itself. money many means food housing family. Tourism also guarantees entrance money expected tough economic year. Found idiot lmao least Jeep sleep in. I'm looking forward Hatchback Hotel. Tell countries still long way go peak, india, Brazil, USA, Chili, many others getting started, also note much bigger countries European countries. treat card fake official document punish people use accordingly? laws US forbid use fake official documents? free medical care then, means everyone, go vote top billing. mean...isn't obesity still #1 cause death States? ""prevent, treat"" mindset un-American point lol see people tv, would surreal would encounter real life... want send kindest thoughts best wishes affected illness recovery also suffering stress caused many ways situation we've suddenly found in. 

I live country people mostly visit doctor something starts hurting gets critical, 'it's flu' 'it's made dark agenda' type views situation common. gets claim tired almost exclusively mental stress, believe used active sporty incomplete recovery COVID19 demoralizing stressful. add stress people mocking trying keep safe automotive workplace mask wearing sort joke social distancing practically absent (my city supposedly new cases free while, still seems negligent disrespectful me). thousands restaurants nationwide reverting back old ways caring employees sick... They‚Äôre covering Covid cases closing stores staff infected. uh sir America Same, I‚Äôm sad can‚Äôt see mum rest family. I‚Äôm Australia borders still closed state I‚Äôm living another outbreak god knows I‚Äôll get go home. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs important note China‚Äôs reponse... dictatorship. don‚Äôt hold elections. care think. rights few, abuses notorious. 

They, countries, pulled resources tried stem hard. should‚Äôve wake call every country serious is. China protecting it‚Äôs citizens? Holy fuck. 

It‚Äôs honestly like US China traded places. China imagine US would done vice versa. People dinosaurs never co-existed. flintstones... narrative outright dangerous. 10 million people 2 billion sort lockdown social distancing forms. I'm literally getting sick people comparing pandemic flu. many deaths need understand difference? Half million people died numbers ain't going down.

Those leaders trying play convenience and/or short term gains going go history reckless irresponsible. know what, maybe world needs US get way great yourself. get cheap shop glasses anywhere(amazon etc) $1-3. clear wrap around better sunglasses. get sealed foam lined ones well $10 want protection. biggest issue getting ones interfere mask fog. yet again, money problem. Money arbitrary!!!! seems messed up. corona beginning, early March. kidneys lungs hurt much still, cough every day. went fit runner losing breath walking talking. I‚Äôm still tired. really hope get better soon don‚Äôt know long it‚Äôs going take. Night nurse, hiker, biker. already chronic migraines, maybe 4-6 year. I've 5 8 weeks since ""got over"" Covid. 

I also full 2 minute round CPR code 2 weeks ago got breath started black out.

I can't imagine even trying bike hike without somebody finding passed ground. Instead I've done short walk go 15 minutes need rest, walking! 

While I've got family still telling ""It's bad. fine."" I'm dinguses. Race used divide working classes
 That's MLK murdered speak Memphis sanitation workers strike pivoted towards workers rights.

But dont even acknowledge action take place point. powers stable footing? day shall overcome? many boots must licked? mail-in voting supposed solve, apparently lead rampant voter fraud (despite lack evidence support claim). Remote online voting would even subjected fraud due transmission data internet logged locally machine. security likely going internet would locally anyway, would probably transmitting everything clear text attempt kind encryption even obfuscation. I'll hold breath see goes. trying picture number big numbers hard wrap head around Highest death rate Taiwan last 10 years last months. 

You look up. would Japanese student lie... Lol, clearly flew cases yesterday in. flew locusts well. Problem people tx, work nurse got did, still fighting fatigue ""feeling right"". sick end March. hospital like another coworker ours. felt residual issues fatigue well lasted mid May. still shit ton things know virus. Arizona seeing increase Definitely could happen. Point is: really trust country's numbers cases like Florida counting every negative test (when several person) order look like numbers lower? know others same? one american quotes ever seen. lord bless country full smarties like him. jeez. Approximately 0.0064102564103% math correct. figure used elsewhere 7.594 Billion total world population, surprised info slightly date. 500k sure

The early 'excess death' analysis developed countries seem estimate real death toll +30-100% higher. take low end number, consider likely much higher developing countries, going estimate total death toll \~1 million unrealistic. I‚Äôm currently using 5g, it‚Äôs great. months now, it‚Äôs triple speed ISP. don‚Äôt understand 5g conspiracy theorists around (where live) they‚Äôre using 5g look bogus articles. That's ridiculous sentiment have. seem understand human nature all. far easier forcibly discourage people certain things coax right things. 

That's like saying need laws people simply rob others. Yeah shit. that's realistic all. 

Here's people would stop self-serving act greater good- connected collectively hivemind. Otherwise, submitting system punishment 100% effective detering bad actors next feasible way forward. think tiny piece cloth tyranny, wait till see respirator looks feels like. Coronavirus: *road trip!!* see interesting lawsuits coming. Yeah mid December remember reading possible new SARS outbreak China. Nah, need laws.

In Austria never wore masks (if surgeon, lol). made mandatory everyone started wear them. Begrudgingly first, got used it.

It helped, numbers down, moment longer made masks mandatory everyone took off. went grocery shopping day single person wore mask (I pulled stated feel weird).

People dumb comfortable. can't rely ""personal responsibility"" pandemic. One asshole enough spread dozens (and hundreds) people. It‚Äôd nice get stimulus money based tax returns, we‚Äôd actually get compensated based actually make minimum wage. Servers pay lot taxes every year huge back bone workforce. pandemic hurt us ways one. Everyone industry dedicated hardworking come work every day knowing likely get Covid still good laugh, genuinely make people smile, give good service, also get ass kicked. country isn‚Äôt taking care us. Especially Arizona restaurants outbreaks amongst staff. Instead they‚Äôre issuing liquor license suspensions. I‚Äôm honestly nervous we‚Äôre gonna loose jobs hopefully it‚Äôs unemployment funds run out. We‚Äôll struggling together not. agree. Look New York. Look started, know went through, attitude Gov. strict policies put place. followed science told Trump running state would open safe so. Look result compared state..Texas. huge difference leadership. Ever heard economic hit men? reason another parts world literal garbage. strategy. Supposedly hurting donations, almost spaces available donate looked online. Plus virus. mutate, everyone get reinfected, another 5 million... Fans sign waiver hold WWE liable caught COVID-19 really really wish could stuff like massive needle vein phobia stops me. start passing sight needle. :( Well, isnt whole thing America?  clincher. may perfectly safe beach six foot radius, poop? many people go beach stop somewhere cold drink/ice cream/lunch? drive around work rely mostly public washrooms. everything shut March panic. People soon clamoring able get go drive - ""We'll stay car, we're going beach"" - many people go hours without bathroom, deny stopping treat store. bet ass going try. Ya got keep job economic crisis? fear op pointed out. 

People zero fear typically morons. Yeah I'm absolving grandparents here. dad, senior citizen obese, diabetes heart problems, lives place huge outbreak spring, complains every day requirement wear mask. keeps whining uncomfortable restricts breathing. think he's still wearing it, keeps complaining media overhyping virus. matter time refuses wear anymore. friends already stopped wearing one.

And supposed do, exactly? He's grown man lives 1,000 miles away, persuaded arguments health, believe them, people's lives, give shit people. like 30 million people country like they're gonna fuck us.  Plz look photo above, see proud maskless fighters equality? smarr af. praise Oxford Vaccine already ordered following:

1. UK government
2. US government 
3. European Union (under alliance Germany, France, Italy Netherlands)
4. CEPI + GAVI + Serum Institute (1 Billion doses low income countries)
5. Brazil (will manufacture Brazil)

Manufacturing already started AstraZeneca ""at risk"".

AFAIK manufacturing shouldered governments/organizations ordered it, AstraZeneca get costs back even vaccine work.

Poor countries cannot afford vaccine get donation (non-profit alliances dedicated purpose.

As individuals paying vaccine:

I can't see happening anywhere aside (unlikely) US, seem weird concept. based saying, cant afford to. cant imagine living entire life country hate blame predicament. seems like US making miserable. leave figure economics later go gentle good night. directly related political party charge states.

Florida always gets tons attention anything affect elections since important swing state. Well duh... Go fish somewhere else. Karen gets around Wait guys indoor service? recently opened stage 2 3 allows people patios that's it. I'd really weary indooe service. Rochester, NY. supposed go business trip huge University conference DC March 11. Monday week normal. end week (March 6) cancelled. spent next week talking students currently spring break. went home office last time March 13 home since. likely even begin start going back campus fall, boss says expect us back 2021. hopeful optimistic. Still am. That‚Äôs right? don't, I'm simply explaining remain social quarantine. sure find controversial. entirely possible reopening early large protests drove rise cases.

exactly - event gets bunches people together spread virus so. playing silly politics claim reopening cause LA County still ""reopened"" massive protests 2-3 weeks ago. can't wait headlines Philly suburbs. Drove bar last night people crammed outdoor patio, since drinking one masks on. Cool cool cool. Wow, medals everyone! You‚Äôre seeing effect zero testing existed start NYC epidemic. Hypothetically means there‚Äôs still time stop it, doubt will. numbers going get much higher reported early NYC numbers, deaths happen. seem understand masks route near normal. alternatives widespread death health impact economic apocalypse service industries, mandatory quarantine fucking apocalypse.

There huge chunk people come fucking business mandatory mask policy ffs even remotely true lol. They've mentioning Twitter, mentioned infograph related Uso's come ring once, clearly shown posters Money Bank match.

They're mentioning know he'll back, got nothing 'erasing history books' find hard believe protests didn‚Äôt help spread cases. It‚Äôs fine protest shit probably pandemic. heard people say protesting lives. Well covid could well kill incapacitate you. Honestly states everyone wears masks fine. basically mimics herd immunity.

There‚Äôs reason places spiking Trump states. Enough enough! I‚Äôve mother f***ing viruses mother f***ing state!  fuck kinda shit this? Dallas,Texas(i protests) less week later,the icu full medical district closed public infected sitting wheel chairs lobby....the city recovering they're fucked

i asked quarantine got back house countryside outside Fort Worth 

less 2 days later Houston,Texas (my hometown) medical district closed Dallas

it goes show cant trust governor imo said case feds name Trump Modi. right wing nut case. Closed whole country without giving second thought migrant workers would stranded create massive crowds trying get back villages. walking, disabilities, many miles. opens again, even numbers still climbing. 

Hospitals refuse admission Covid-19 patients ask lot money upfront admit. many dying homes. Alone! 

This article refers anomaly. happening one slum. many anomalies huge diverse land. great example managing pandemic state Kerala put place strategies January onwards. 

But many parts country, numbers keep rising. happy bacteria? fix it? Right time latest cases two Vietnamese women recently returning country Kuwait, said ministry, noting quarantined upon arrival treated Hanoi capital city.

not 2 community spread cases, 2 imports quarantine try specialize differentiate BLM Trump Rallyings, look politics obsessed mass me. I'm guessing dont work mental health field. mental health crisis like people lost entire support system. Well say ""no, "", checked web site do! heart goes you. mom nursing home I'm sure I'll see again. I'm sure I'll see pump vaccine. whole situation fucked I'm angry. 



To add insult injury, im working restaurant majority staff customers dont seem give damn anymore. Hell walked street 8 people standing outside bar without mask sight...... Nope. Could also vitamin D, plain old middle cold flu season theories (eg, both). I‚Äôll studying get major computer engineering. dream work something music related (not sure, still research careers). know it‚Äôs comes computer engineering music it‚Äôs like niche field difficult get into. I‚Äôm open working field graduate tho, know experience important. Hopefully experience leads want be. every page working base page. even link ICU capacity chart removed. Anyone texas comment people reacting there? get feeling much different, f vibe vs..when NY near capacity, could wrong. wondering going go cliff likely way. responsible ignorant people wear masks take situation seriously, people blame China it. Blood type, curiosity? developed dysautonomia (specifically diagnosed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) 5 years ago 19. cause determined, although time fell ill, taking medication may weakened immune system enough allow virus attack parts nervous system. first months extremely hard. take semester college, fact. constant feeling drunk/lightheaded, light sensitivity, digestive issues, confusion/brain fog. took 3 years hard work (exercising/fluids/medications) get back 80% felt like illness, another year get 90-95% (now medications). cortisol levels slightly elevated ever since, too, although endocrine disorders thoroughly ruled last year. Regardless opinion intelligence level people disagree with, masks don‚Äôt masks meant protect person wearing mask. meant stop direct droplet exposure person. also fact form fitting like N95s droplets still escape sides.

Then there‚Äôs increased risk low oxygen levels blood stream causing dizziness headaches extended use. Hmmm...Huntington Beach Los Angeles County - sure relevance statistics LA County.

Anyway, seriously, ReOpen protest May 9th!!!!!! Holy cow - that's seven weeks ago!!! spike cases event would happened LONG AGO. can‚Äôt afford to. could move Canada strict rules regarding immigration, including requiring employed Canadian company moving there. everything going on, many companies hiring. I‚Äôm also close family don‚Äôt feel comfortable moving far away them.

So, I‚Äôm stuck here. Im work restaurant Virginia, servers noses masks. 19 corvids counts murder. What's better, NC home Duke UNC medicine well global headquarters several pharma/CROs directly work one, definitely know somoone does. people excuse, they're selfish, ignorant, stubborn a**holes. (I live Raleigh support message) really. want everyone go big flu dances get flu together end season earlier. everyone get sick time isnt something healthcare system economy set for. happened California? thought shit together while. Fuck dude, hoped everything would died could go vacation early October get away shit peace guess that‚Äôs happening now. Fucking hell idiots cannot reasoned unfortunately. lost, gone forever madness. politics seem crazy...this pandemic political anyway, tragic. knows, thats page missing want say intentionally removed. Holding breath probably overkill bigger risk fumbling mask touching stuff store putting back on. would recommend switching passcode apple pay. ""Many people saying first wave bigliest ever history world."" take much rich move businesses friendly country ton want them. Look amazon. States give massive tax breaks want business employment commerce. push amazon major corporations away employment goes level fiscal control. People dont understand devastating losing Amazon would be. Tht's good. Thank you. :) mean??

Hold butts No, 3 months kidneys came back ""online"". incredibly fortunate. ignorance, low IQ. people high IQs act like exist people low IQs wear damn mask. work restaurant customers horrible higher rate I've ever seen.

We tried trusting people would right thing, get stricter. set check point outside guests longer allowed inside building without mask. exceptions.

We masks sale dollar door, may mask table, that's it.

If people problem eat somewhere else, patience put people risking communities safety entitled, short sighted bullshit. mutates enough (unlikely) still related enough original, one could think crossing milestone twice. No, regular UI benefits starvation wages. hits keep coming virus think seems possible. six people different households get together could 28 people exposed one small gathering. everyone exposed would need present. answer would satisfy you, want answer. economy ü§î Go Florida Go Florida Go Florida 

God damn people fucking smart. SMH. don‚Äôt know say that. didn‚Äôt anything know anyone anyone else couldn‚Äôt done. admit tall, white man opened doors would closed people, *and welcome fine tuning things reduce reality*. burning things throwing baby bath water.  i'm starting wonder virus, people, instead attacking lungs attacks logic reasoning center brain. Talk body language, good Dr,s, snow white forgot ""though shall speak untruths"" Califorinaaaaaaaaaaa üéµ That's saying, tis laughable. Yep, or, take stance ‚Äúif I‚Äôm meant get it, get it‚Äù without taking precautions. I‚Äôve tried warn potential life altering quality-of-life effects virus. Every. Single. Time. think I‚Äôm overreacting taking way seriously. Even dad going restaurants, masks, etc. I‚Äôm like WTF... Tradition peer pressure ancestors 5%. fools around still going Florida vacation. We‚Äôll locked ever before. It‚Äôll mandatory masks till next spring. seems gop motto, ain't covid test them. 

Florida excess numbers ridiculous, could well 10k deaths right due covid. terrible article one reading... saying people went protests probably likely fucked... protests people staying home avoid people may offsetting people getting sick protesting Put mask stupid. shut sit down. Oh, guy fired head prosecutor sdny, currently investigating him, replacing head SEC never spent single day kind law enforcement prosecutorial work whatsoever? also heard SEC guy got position SEC guy gave him, previously thre SEC guy corporate lawyer Goldman sachs/wells Fargo? 


That guy? indoor vs outdoor, mask vs mask. important behaviors different here. many people age 10 died? number people going get test cause ""they think would fun"" small. someone taking time effort get tested... that's symptom enough.

This going backfire result Covid cases road.

From beginning told, ""Testing, testing, testing..."" Thought never catch Lol. Would still love get FIRST check. course enforced. Company's care anything money. run blood profit. company sent letter stating allow people refusing masks come little mall stores deny service call police even mask mandated states. disgusting. End elective surgeries, close bars, clubs, restaurants churches (yeah know) - top 100% mask mandate. know thing goes. good, sorry youre feeling way, didnt mean offend upset. hope feel better, wish good health family. run ICU website would mess entire world. Keep mind US 50% higher GDP next highest country world economy runs them. Shutting done would devastating globally. Temperature checks aren‚Äôt even functionally mandatory. requirement says ‚Äútemperature checks conducted site feasible‚Äù. ‚Äúwhen feasible‚Äù cop out. true. act like mass gatherings vulnerable COVID bcuz protesting laughable never floated river before? LOL exactly one things lockdown supposed prevent. 

One priorities locking buy us enough time sufficient capacity supplies testing massive scale.

It's though someone passed law secret must everything wrong way regards fighting coronavirus. There's thing called ""right"" lockdown. There's point lockdown know contamination started. also can't get lockdowns without knowing possible cure / vaccine might get ready.

You can't keep people home months / years. That's impossible. 

At best, preventive measures taken, confuse lockdowns. virus acknowledge lockdowns. virus person tries something gives up. virus cease existing people home.

Besides, USA one populous countries. higher population, higher contamination. That's works. me? still get sick nearly sick. bid they‚Äôre smart. think it‚Äôs biggest contribution may end diminished trust politicians called experts supported hard lockdowns also supported protests. Anyone previously fence like fuck it, people get protest, get what‚Äôs important me. never occur people viewpoint maybe misinterpreted writing/after lot translations, real meaning lost (I.e. story genesis telling story evolution Bronze Age farmers). 21 year old type 1 diabetic here. Workout least hour 4 times day play pickup basketball probably 5 hours week. virus ass 2 weeks, headaches lasted another 2 weeks fatigue normal 6 total weeks sleeping 10 hours day still napping. got working nursing home back early April feel like fully recovered couple weeks ago. isn‚Äôt anything fuck around with. seems small actually see 500,000 people it‚Äôs large amount people San Francisco, cases largely stagnated rising unlike parts california. without described, prepared face serious threat rather brush off. maybe done without things like apps track location shit. It‚Äôs sales. 20% dinner Denny‚Äôs lot different 20% Spago Beverly Hills. work also much different. started bottom(dishwasher diner) worked way 15+ years get level I‚Äôm at. volunteered alongside construction crews, always seemed really well-adjusted. Show reasonable hour, good amount quality work, go home spend time friends/family. Thank you. fault lies planners. hubris lockdowns see backlash. make antibodies faster. secondary response see much higher levels produced much quicker way past that. linked growing outbreak Grosse Pointe. college kids went hit bars came back attended parties. Yeah, want go around Florida reason.... $17,688 raised $15,000 goal GoFundMe. people thinking? get blood tests pretty regularly.  BUN/creatinine ratio levels whack first time ever sick 3 months ago.  time also experienced severe heat intolerance.  feel like I'm dehydrated even though drink plenty water. I'm going little sir crazy going freaking bar right insane. I'm area packed means can't walk people. shimmy bit stop look little opening shimmy repeat et al good policy we're running blood. already get asked country ever sex man. I'm asking life story keep saying, I'm asking question rephrased. We've 35 years figure out, test disease blood banks, think discriminatory anything say you. great night  Shit's fine here. don‚Äôt know much software development, hear it‚Äôs great career pays well. Maybe look attending community college transferring university, maybe polytechnic uni (usually known hands on). could maybe look trade school. There‚Äôs research coming association virus different blood types. us type disadvantage. Im BOH, BOH. happy industry. Killed love cooking agree you. U.S home since March 1. get groceries delivered, eat ever, leave start car get mail. sacrifice. Even see punk's bars people crowded together parties admit get little pissed thinking making last longer should. Money always going matter do, sadly. bartender, I'll pass that. know restaurant would pay bartenders $25-50 hour. I'll take karen abuse money day assume asymptomatic cases found known exposure, workplace, example. Yes. Man fuck off. pathetic. 

Look around world; America look good right now? 

Or look like bunch pathetic children unable face reality. 

Go. Fuck. Yourself. 

And take look mirror stop defending failure Hope get chance see &lt;3 modeling page projections many ICU beds capacity planning, check link Must nice rationally thinking government. jelly.  ACE2 rich islet cells, pre-existing immune antibodies. Plus, existing viruses trigger Type 1 diabetes (and existing evidence happened) increases probability, small may be. know rely CDC's assertion food poses negligible risk.

They slow even make warnings pets even *fucking obvious*. issue warning confirmed case come *specifically* thing even obvious risk may be. I'm camp believes food risk result order things heat oven check inside temp see hits 150. I've nearly died seasonal flu enough times due autoimmune problems, covid undoubtedly wreck me, I'm waiting there's confirmed case someone got food take precautions food. odds doctors would even think reason? see reason would even issue warning, would likely dismiss patient thought got food. 

If dangerous touch hand mouth touched something covid it, I'm going assume putting something mouth covid also dangerous. problem *start* medical solution - wearing masks social distancing - one wants it. see things around Indian Ocean. looks Chinese - virus really came - spread place last year. countries simply though it.

I live outskirts Indian Ocean 100 000 arrivals China per month. obvious people coughing place. made fun flu starts tropics Chinese bring back country.

It also interesting know US CDC believes meanwhile least 90% cases go undetected. Give two weeks people understand reason lockdown? individuals can't what's best country, country them. kidding. individuals can't even what's best let alone anyone else. 

You want businesses open back up? Wear damn masks might able to. Near tried hard get headquarters Syracuse, couldnt compete. major push city. Wow. Arizona amazing. Staying open face adversity. Citizens sound proud. Even Texas gave in.... definitely component indoors risky points matter viral load lets infection take place. outdoor congregation much air volume work makes harder spread. situation breathe one virus one done. 

NYC done impressive job think inherent communal attitude city has. 9/11, Sandy, this. city seems inherently collectivist allows weather better places. post-modern literary critic know permanent harmful effects outside death. He's gonna hearing Karen.  thank you. worked retail 7 years. Good enough me. could seen coming? people outside Seattle would travelled Seattle protests returned home various counties. Oh, sure. I‚Äôm BC, Canada, one best responses continent. We‚Äôre getting back normal, veeerrrryyy cautiously. 

The US fucked *years*. Hahaha well like wtf want? job give $10,000 keep apartment? realize people upset depressed angry. haircuts exact situation. Sucks youre that's kinda country works. go work get money use house. quit health money. options man sucks call make. I'd go work go homeless that's Shit. That's odd. actually gave doctors note classified safe position. kind think might example Duncan Effect. want leave keep staying. Think one breaking point pushing back. wanted work medicine, would. many long term effects diminished lung capacity asthma. You‚Äôre right though that‚Äôs reason enough refuse failure? 

New York‚Äôs failure?

Any place make something look like rating ""OMIGOD HEALTH INSPECTOR HERE, STALL THEM!!!"" egregious problems.

But 8 restaurants I've worked in, one where, health inspector arrived, say ""oh hi, doing? come back look.""

One particularly shady (and rather nice-looking) spot \*laminated manual\* behind bar, indicating both: a) things must put immediately garbage inspector arrives, b) best practices stall health inspector. called ""The Five Minute Drill."" maybe two minute.

I realize really stop flights, plenty people brought virus system weak, one obvious step protect country virus control another country. Technically election... never elected first time around. Paula Reid slammed press conference, really choice. I‚Äôve afraid go. taking place strict safety measures. semi-walk limp excuse argument right here.

As chronic depressive, know manage without harming others.

Your losses caused stunningly poor federal response, paid part billionaires big corps.

Crowds dangerous number reasons, disease amplifies risk exponentially. death rate comment? Well guess congratulations finally grasping slippery concept mortality.

So pull cotton ears brain case, stuff behind mask, hopefully keep spewing idiotic obfuscation topic. Assuming work situation allow social distancing skeleton crews private offices (rooms, cubicle farms), what's recommended thing masks workday you?

My masks I've wearing around neck (homemade masks go around back head instead ears) I'm wondering that's OK.

That's pretty similar one co-workers wearing one ear alone desk. Hope so. 50% capacity means 0% capacity since restaurants shut down. difficult understand?? never got that, instead handing money, buy stocks also gain part future profits? Perhaps want 100% government owned due carelessly seems handled, still, would help stabilizing debts future, no? Damn stated question better. people know going August really trying convince go saying cheap prices safer go Cancun travel within U.S. obviously leaning towards hell wanted see people think. inflammation everywhere, including lot throat/ear stuff.

Ultimately got relief steroids calm immune system down. ongoing post viral inflammation, could ask doctor something help it.

Hope feel better soon pandemic yet? much better, still back 100%.

Not sure someone downvoted you. caught twice??? Look, know future hope medical advances crazy shit happen second, third fourth wave Covid-19. One reasons 1918 flu got bad people refused wear masks refused follow guidelines. also good way treat time. even known quarantine first wave jail people wearing masks following guidelines second wave fire still people refused. happening today exact things we're going 1918 flu. People, even mass deaths still thought overblown refused corporate. making exact mistakes. hospitals staff take much. I'm already seeing quite post people hospitals area please follow guidelines real running room convert another floor ICU floor. get run deaths area go Covid-19 also medical emergencies can't taken care properly beds enough staff take care them. children's hospitals started taking patients 30 years age help surge. largest hospital Houston, TMC states keeps surge capacity July 7th. Also, stopped elective surgeries four largest cities. good. way. imagine virus started US instead China? long would gone without even discovered new virus rather ""just flu""? actually insane people still looking China shudder even think would happened originated US. want say 70% people LA county care unfortunately. good portion spite ""stick man"" think they're invincible. people refuse wear mask, social distance, fighting workers try enforce rules designed safety. 

I can't fathom wanting safe ensuring others stay safe healthy become political stance one vulnerable times lives. hurt everyone try right thing get screwed inconsiderate dense cabbages. One person much team fit follow procedure. unfortunately team cuts corners lot way coronavirus guidelines. Now? It‚Äôs worse added stress overworked, getting enough hours, add customers compliant something simple wearing face mask. It‚Äôs going get worse regardless safety measures people take bad habits workers. fake news, Pencey-Poo. scurred.  It‚Äôs scary shit. clarion call me. I‚Äôve HYPER cautious beginning, found surviving could mean organ failure life long health problems idea mitigation much risk possible became focus. 

I‚Äôm actually moving apartment don‚Äôt share space someone whose nearly cautious am. might turn greatest understatement. sure Covid-19 works makes sense. Also, targets certain blood types lethally. Bad time read recovering mild case :( really concerning. could tell people NY/NJ scared staying indoors blowing there. people indifferent numbers warning could get control fast, sure endgame is. Exponential growth exponential growth. can‚Äôt wait college football. well shit... 

I infection something late April and, though Covid-19 antigen test came back negative (3 weeks infection cleared up), cautioned test 20% false negative rate.

I able exercise nearly long normal getting winded, even months on. I'm nearly early April, quite there.

This I'm militant mask-wearer. remind co-workers (IT desk-side support) mask heading out. refuse go visit grandmother nursing home opened back outside visitors. I'd rather Zoom talk phone risk taking virus group-living facility average population shit ain't foolin' around! Oh gosh, I'm sorry. That's beyond horrible. hope symptoms resolve completely soon. wish could do. Whenever someone talks investigated POTS history spinal tap feel need ask possible spinal cerebral spinal fluid leak. goes kentucky UK we've football matches..no crowds ..just club banners cover seats crowd noise PA...get used ...its coming way U.S.. know, reading sooooo hard fraction death rate Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden France?

I done you. United States ""Healthcare"" system stands make trillions next generation.

The spread Covid United States essentially unrestricted. School janitor Michigan. I'm fucking terrified. one wearing mask, HR provide masks, I'm getting harassed daily people think virus fake. HR refuses deal well.

I live two immunocompromised individuals, one work understand I'm upset all. administration making political thing place schools.

I know districts across state country also worked plans remote learning resources person learning can't happen. prediction person learning happening. taking steps form curriculum end repeat end 2020 school year.

I interview coming cause I'm afraid go work anymore guy phone goes ""now know feel masks wearing one cause fog glasses.""

""Sir, glasses, excuse. manage fine sweating ass 10 hours day. I'm sorry, I'm longer interested employment company."" I'm afraid going continue search.

So anyone knows anyone hiring Michigan takes safety seriously, DM me, point care state long safe. nuts. doubt we'd situation almost July. Yeah, great. mum technically apartment complex, 95%+ probably elderly people. pretty Ill moderate dementia (still awaiting depth testing, 18/30 quick note Montreal testing), think depends what's made. Uncooked food like sandwiches salads require gloves, slapping toppings pizza seems whatever.

I always wore gloves worked restaurants, even required, I'm gross. wanting advice. I'd say odds dying covid much lower ending homeless. solutions shitty situations, hence people protesting, altho plenty people say could get haircut deny call fake news None North Korea 

They kIck ass stats clearly accurate problem people decided many infected, going die, long going die, fine. 

Oh, medical professionals promised save lives, to, matter affects health. 

And finally, media lying. faith going live lives way want. 

FML. Midwest? single idiot Naperville wears mask downtown. stupidity mind hurting. People keep asking plans fourth.

Nope. Stay home, stay safe. agree would people stirred weren‚Äôt actively encouraged leadership? remember ‚ÄúLiberate Liberate‚Äù tweets protestors storming government buildings Go unemployment, able get reduced hours. get $600 week plus whatever state gives you. 

This comment fucking hackery. government botched response containing disease? Yes. money aspect they‚Äôve done fine on. Pull head ass, figure unemployment, get money need. bet told they‚Äôd get Trump gold coin day wearing mask, they‚Äôd it. Great move peak pandemic (so far). President Trump. I‚Äôm waiting doorknob licking challenges start. Dumb fucks. SHOULD. antibody tests hugely unreliable? Sending ‚ù§Ô∏è good vibes full recovery ü§û think protesting close quarters pandemic isn‚Äôt smartest idea, rapid opening bars, nightclubs, restaurant indoor seating, etc, seems like would‚Äôve bigger impact. Metro area - yes, 2.3. City - 1.5 (give take) least according Google. Texas familiar area. compared actual city population numbers greater area metro area numbers. peace mind, back March husband. moderate symptoms. Took antibody test couple weeks ago still tested positive antibodies. 

We residual symptoms. Lost smell &amp; taste, came back fine. bad cough, lungs completely fine. feel 100% back normal. say might something unforeseeable future, thread makes seem like everyone terrible life long symptoms. hasn‚Äôt case us. 1776 Policy directly related covid purely political least they're admitting it. We're still denial. Ugh thank sharing this. really wanted donate next month, mom warned might safe That‚Äôs slightly unfair. yes part reason didn‚Äôt recommend masks supply, agree straightforward.

However beginning pandemic didn‚Äôt realize extent asymptomatic spread. Masks still aren‚Äôt protective individual. mitigate spread contagious person someone else. OG sars people showed symptoms soon becoming infectious, widespread mask use less effective. sars cov2 time discovered large amount spread comes asymptomatics. Therefore strategy needed change assume every person street currently spreading virus proven otherwise. type environment widespread mask use crucial component slowing spread. 

But it‚Äôs unfair put knowing 20 20 vision scientists making suggestions based best possible current evidence. insane, imagine people ok restruant breaking health code could pay rent business. 

I'd love see kitchen nightmare Ramsey restraunts breaking covid regulation reasoning money.  friend works HEB San Antonio. Panic buying full force stay-at-home mass text sent Bexar County.

80% people covid mild symptoms. 

moderate severe symptoms make 20% ones either result death lingering effects. I'm Euro want filthy Euro blood, apparently. White House actively arguing SCOTUS repeal ACA including preexisting conditions. lingering Covid damages going deemed preexisting. say Private business cater desire. simply meant government restriction I'm anyone buying firearm certain time date. /r/bodyweightfitness calling ‚ÄúWhen testing extent, you‚Äôre going find people, you‚Äôre going find cases. said people, ‚ÄòSlow testing down, please.‚Äô test test.‚Äù Sure thing. institutionalized. Trump fall guy everything politicized days reality Americans always greater risk takers, rights/freedoms/individualism always taken priority collectivism. benefits... lot great things innovations would come light take risks. obviously there's downside. Fortunately, pandemics occupy small percentage history past pandemics much less means intervention prevention deter humans moving forward. saying masks deplete oxygen destroy immune system importantly, make look like sheeple. mean, that's doctors wear - want destroy immune systems deprive oxygen like, work anyways.

Whatever percentage capacity allowed, percentage normal rent pay. perhaps flat 20% takeout-only situations. clear, restaurant repeat violations. That‚Äôs fine big. six $250 fines. shutdowns seem like 24 hours, though article isn‚Äôt clear that. exception one restaurant discovered actually bar pretending restaurant. one told can‚Äôt reopen bars allowed open.

Rough time American ... ü•∫ supposed go home Tuesday. see parents brother, hang out. gonna go anywhere anything, yardwork painting. 9 people tested positive husband's job, canceled trip.

Jeez, scrolling noticed Japan‚Äôs testing rate even lower that. enjoyed comment 2020 Reddit thanks Whoa. worse thought I‚Äôd see. Fresh virus tactics like universal mask wearing, extensive testing people, aggressive contract tracing, strictly enforced quarantine. 

How trying that? Seems worked countries. Also, antibodies give plasma!!!!! Gave last month !! need It, save life I‚Äôve I‚Äôm finally losing it. Going walks twice day mask avoiding people. found small house rent upstate rest summer I‚Äôm going July. can‚Äôt sped summer like spring. 4th July week... many blm riots Europe comparison?

Why? northeast disaster, felt like Texas, florida, georgia, anywhere heat open spaces immune. wonder false sense security burned lot peoples minds can't lose feeling impervious too. late convince people. minutes BLM protests allowed *encouraged* government right-wing open protests deemed ""killing grandma"" week prior, people decided okay open go out. 


It impossible convince people groups 100 bar bad idea scientists silent groups 10,000 even science side regarding masks closing high risk businesses. 

Scientists politicians chance prove exceptions large groups, failed. live society largely okay living risk. virus real asshole. target people based avoiding good people. Hmmmmh remember Newsome literally told people go eat. politicians everywhere told people go back work. People told do! holy shit, report nursing board and/or public health office know, doomed read article says would contradictory. Indeed, article said may correlation increase % cases 20-40s group result protests. However, surmise increase offset groups staying home. California, groups stay home. It‚Äôs rough recovery. days felt almost back normal able light lifting walk dog around block, next day would back ass entire day. 

Not sure symptoms terrible migraine-like headaches relief CBD oil, heat packs, listening light music dark. Hope start feeling better! 6 months. even beginnings good reason act together now. Everyone expresses sadness fear different ways. know lot times express lot lot anger first feel like can't control what's happening. reflecting usually realize I'm sad scared. tf about? awkward thing nobody's talking right sex outdoors public park probably safest way hook right now, epidemiology-wise. glory-holes, which, remarkably, NYC HEALTH DEPARTMENT actually recommended. New cases California increased since Day 1. Despite media coverage, appear virus discriminates based upon victim's agenda. weather, hand, seems like big factor...just like flu. think would agree overall sentiment. seem they're quite bit better w/ protecting citizens corona. I'm quite shocked poorly U.S. compared similar countries. Oh nos

We need stickers people!!

Can‚Äôt live without stickers think I'm quickly approaching point let die stupidity. think really useful conversation try find more. hard testing data collated across countries. might measured same: pool 20 samples one test comes negative, test one person 20?

In case looking total tests done 90 day period.  Portugal tested 1/10 population 90 days, 1/900 per day. comparison Colorado testing 1/725 day last month, clearly bigger number. 

Or it? know Portugal's max daily testing capacity. What's highest ever one day? Googling find it. certainly likely could one day average. comparing total tests since January wrong since time US testing. 1/500 knee-jerk upper bound - true number may 1/1000. Normally discussion starts end: daily infections exceed 1/5000 population per day (1/500 10% positivity) testing much you.

There several things going want mention. 

1. country-wide problem sharing testing states. Since every state needs tests run containment operation there's way focus Austin handle local outbreak. 

2. think pooling much all. probably comes back haphazard way tests processed private labs, knew expected positivity could certainly increase number people tested dramatically appropriate sized pool group. Pooling China tested Wuhan (10 million people, still 1/1400 country's population) one transmission cycle. 

3. Many states containing.  Around March 1 Norway realized enough tests. Within 24 hours country lockdown. matter many tests do, going anywhere near enough mitigate aka test large portion population every day. countries mitigating (like Sweden) essentially ignoring testing.

With combined, states containing riding fine line. infections rose factor 2-4 Colorado, enough tests connect trace. It‚Äôs beautiful allegory gentle reminder majority white America supports Trump exactly cruelty. Yup. beats up. usually couple days wanting die weeks hoping feel better tomorrow. US got get leadership, whatever party would be, wake fuck realize shit. playing BS incalculatable harm wont even know extent years come guess Pence Librul now?  like dealing arthritic dad chews tobacco had-cancer-two-years-ago mother covid stuff.

um, that's fucking irrelevant topic hand. really cleaning house periodically bleach whole time.
Sigh... None picking right now. NRA issue go straight ACLU? need guns. constitutional right. mean there've 22 confirmed coronavirus deaths New Zealand though Ok, then. Let's close hospitals send resources meidcal personnel areas. 

They're obviously immune virus, needing want meaningful strength need gym. Eliminating asymptotic people official counts testing promote spreading freaking moron Ehhhh. Debatable? sister laws got together (4 people) end exposing total 18 extra people go home. That's 22 people. husband goes sees couple cousins quickly double that.

Its norm, combo large families multigenerational households really rarity either. I'm covid mask denier means isnt air filter exact thing masks do? like said good. pondering idea affect, im expert medicine strong medical background, curious study getting other's prespectives it. ibd terrible, know symptoms crazy harsh. cant imagine feels, cause sounds like cause tissues fuse create openings. (what!?)

on another note: think practice medicine always personal, focuses health person. times massive public health crisis, think people often forget that. sometimes fall notion well, sorry nonchalant topic. Thank god. Stay away beach, head Walmart. 

They never close point don‚Äôt see anything get ‚Äúblamed‚Äù anything. gets away everything. everyone Congress basically complicit point continuing try impeach - Barr matter. It‚Äôs unreal. unworried seem, doubts plan rigging November elections. Americans terrified precedents set right now, instead worried masks infringing ‚Äúrights‚Äù. nightmare. first paragraph right on. Everyone aware shits going it‚Äôs face it‚Äôs kinda ehhh. 

I‚Äôm staying home much possible purchased bunch face shields wear whenever enter building people. They're less researched masks likely protect wearer masks do. They're also minorly uncomfortable.

First, HydroCloroquine became popular initial French study. study widely criticised unprofessional. ended harming HydroCloroquine's reputation severely.

Secondly Donald Trump. made HydroCloroquine controversial, right multiple studies started doubting drug effect.

You also conveniently forgetting recent British study. study held high regard many big names board. extensive found HydroCloroquine *not* work. study far nail HydroCloroquine coffin.

Lastly mention 'expensive' medication Remdesivir. forget mention medicine made available low cost Gilead. criticism Gilead seems unfounded. 

At moment British study says HydroCloroquine *not* work still seems leading answer. consensus still appears HQ best answer COVID19. 

And finally, medications look promising. study countries locked down, etc....most failing now...despite strict measures....

really..we clueless.. least admitted lack tests florida cities counties say adequate number tests going many tests.

In Jacksonville 1.5 million residents city providing maybe 250 tests day. drive thru test area alway closed least couple days week. tests take minimum 3 days results available.

 also private hospitals urgent care clinics go pay testing im sure numbers can't capability many, demonstrates feds made priority get tests hands profit businesses. i‚Äôm sure people said thing spanish flu, polio, small pox... relax get internet really long winded way admitting claim used bailout money buybacks bullshit.

I've wearing mask hot sunny weather week practice. made spot. I'll sure use women's names dipshit comment makes zero sense take China word. Look did. China politician goes media say masks work? encourage public fight rights ""to haircut""? try politicize pandemic caused division among people? Apparently not. 

China virus one knows anything damn thing. US months headstart. Now, China reported less 90k cases, US surpassed 2 millions. Even China lies actually have, let's say 2 millions like US, still sign US fucked advantages. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs filling fast...

Their projection unsustainable surge capacity full 6th July best case scenario. Lol one ignoring [New Yorks instead instead looking date sources properly updated last couple days information. likely technically possible safely, rather would assume can't take enough time work properly isolate visit (who like, 18 days vacation burn quarantine + 2-3 days family?). could also job exposes higher risk situations, could family refusing wear masks such, maybe family lives hot spot? sad bad answer. think right. top schools try football season. fall going bad, corona going explode college campuses kids thinking immune virus age. indeed, loads ignorant inconsiderate people ...how even get rationalised? replacing one prehistoric thing another slightly less prehistoric thing. It‚Äôs tough job. understand vote. credible vaccine experts think 12 18 months there's vaccine scaled production.

When keep pushing articles say months away pushes irresponsible behavior people false premise matter couple months.  flu kills many there's lockdown. we'd never locked we'd much worse off. things scale linearly could order magnitude worse, even that.

People something really weird going on. didn‚Äôt even social distance! thought helped guess going article shouldn‚Äôt social distance. believe anything professionals managing called pandemic say!
I think personally throw away tv‚Äôs, phone computers listen watch anything. Live normal life crazy cleaning/ mask wearing social distancing. bet devices TVs gone wouldn‚Äôt even know called virus even there. Germany released code app already, open source. Boris absolute weapon yet still want math again.... 60% chance catching covid flying. would assuming 6 10 people infected also currently contagious gotten illness. chance catching covid single 1 way flight significantly less 60% even accounting people completely imobile infection. still one higher chances since enclosed space would likely spending hours chance infected likely lower 10% situation. problem actually starts end unlucky get infected person board likely every passenger infected Cool meal home. Put table cloth. Make romantic. Save money. Make fun memory. Survive help others survive go back normal one day.

How fucking big deal eat restaurant awhile? Tldr; main tests done still conclusive. one knows.    




It also mentions Cdc &amp; surgeon general advised early insure hospitals enough. neutral. flip flopped it. still admitting one knows. risk it. wear one. able take antibody test? literally every indoor space banned? He's social media accounts closed - think Facebook YouTube ditched him. like whack-a-mole though, nutters keep popping up. That's going make hard breathe Pepper Kanye West. Look quick went hot new thing slavery-denying White House visitee. mean? Goop cure coronavirus? Texas nice state great, friendly people.  said, addition great people, also scraped bottom barrel. interesting see reporting focus go numbers deaths early states hit hard, almost exclusive coverage total numbers infections now. Every time get new total infections number, demand reporting on:

- many new infections symptomatic (this hard get data, ask test them)
- many symptomatic people became hospitalized period
- many hospitalized died period

Without information, idea number terrible many new people getting infected soon ill die, bad virus spreading rapidly, vast majority infected asymptomatic herd immunity coming sooner, meaningless test statistically significant portions population. 

Without information, everything else that's said done mayor, city council, governor new infection rate number said done ignorance purely politically motivated. That's terribly surprising me. dated girl lived Kenosha visited regularly different scene there...Kind hard even explain. personally live Green Bay part, restaurants bars taking things seriously. even voluntarily shut days learned potential exposure place. Unfortunately, seems deeply affected shutdown ones loose can't afford give opportunity packed bar. don‚Äôt think NY NJ require valid contact info dining. tracing. entering retail stores. wish could upvote more. honestly baffles isn‚Äôt statewide stay-at-home order. Every day wait, another day 2 situation get better. first gets **way** worse gets better. argument turned back Corona alarmist stopped caring last month Anything better nothing. Could always use rubber bands fold handkerchief 12-16 layer mask, different color/pattern every day. Plenty YouTube instructionals. :-) going TMI, long story short doctors tend blow symptoms pain. know pervasive problem. 

Ever since started periods, vagina burned. Horribly. saw 3 different gynos general check ups High School, time blew off, said normal. 

First time tried use tampon, intense burning pain. told normal. 

At 18, tried getting sexually active sex extremely painful. told tense. 

This went 7 years, sex never felt good. always burned. told likely STD (Lol, one partner life) sure enough negative. symptoms pain ignored *again.* 

Finally, I'm 25 years old gyno sort believes me. 12 point. first thought beastly yeast infection. No, it. biopsy (horrible) finally found likely permanent eczema rash. eczema life. made sense. simple. always reported eczema asthma gynocologists never made connection. 

The next year tried cream cream. Nothing worked, literally March year. Coordinating gyno asthma specialist finally medicine called Dupixent. Sex pain gone, burning gone, bonus medicine also treats asthma (so stopped using advair neat). 

It took *years* taken seriously, mean condition real treatable. frustrating time money would push forward while. Look reviews too, helo weed bad doctors. Ask around get recommendations. find good doctor listens, use springboard ever need see different specialist. often connected know good docs are. ‚ÄúCorvid‚Äù? mean ‚Äújackdaw‚Äù? Catchy twitter phrase parents March 1, already devoid Chinese tourists long date Aww cute look innocent little gym-bandwagon phase. ok one day grow up, gain humility see bigger picture. Way 1% population lifts weights/goes gym days mate. WAAAAAAY more. people may simply different goals priorities however.

do even listen extra 600 ends July no! Money printer go brrrr therefore everything going fine! beyond retarded 

1) virus already mutated 14 times, what's stopping mutating point deadly children, especially classroom setting?

2) impossible socially distance kids classroom setting - I'm student teacher classrooms usually consist 20-30 students. cannot maintain six feet, properly sanitize everything, keep children contracting corona outside classroom

3) teacher? impacts teachers poor immune system? Elderly teacher? forego another semester job? ""regular"" teachers contract corona? 

4) What's plan school contracts one covid-19 case? Continue business usual? Cuz that's worked well -\_- Shut school? point opening back up? Non covid pneumonia take 6-12 months fully recover from, lungs capable recovery. I'm hoping need time TLC. reading blood vessels also take 6-8 months heal, too.

I hope back full strength soon 3 days old agree, however never claimed otherwise. Corporate America tremendous influence American politics. doubt! Well said. 

Interestingly, many countries make poor decisions without corporate influence, Sweden great example (Covid-19, refugees). Even doesnt, still effective treatments turn manageable problem. *necessarily* need vaccine move crisis Get chest x-ray please. Don‚Äôt let go. doctor anything remotely close, definitely symptoms someone that‚Äôs healthy. Something may going on.

I chest pains time two years ago. long (~4 weeks) cold quite violent cough. friend told knew two people went symptoms turned lung cancer. moment laughed away 100% convinced cold, time passed pains remained pretty much went opposite mindset accepted going die (also started getting pain left arm random times), stupid got doctor got chest x-ray NOTHING. soon diagnosed nothing pain went away. morale definitely get checked, best case it‚Äôs stress related peace mind health reduce stress levels. That's whole separate issue. feel like what's right guilt something would want work therapist using coping mechanisms such. feeling guilt think making wrong choice would want re-evaluate choices math figure there's Alternatives Etc.

My personal opinion whatever work least think regrets seeing compare regrets something bad happened.

At point may situations family warrant face face conversation visit may change calculus things relatively stable right best interact much via online capabilities, social distancing mask-wearing. would allow safely interact various ways especially things like distant barbecue spending time front porch whatever kind Okay. dont allow TV radio advertisements life, couldnt known. *Florida'd it. It‚Äôs thing people say around office time. Like screw something really irreversible way. Florida'd it. don‚Äôt know comes though. think comes Florida?* K truth government never wanted stop virus. wanted stop would shut airports, train stations bus terminals. Banned truly necessary travel ones home virus could eliminated less 2 months... Instead took actions never going eliminate virus slow spread. True true! Lol, u mad bro   suck? Oh, yeah. lot things we're used doing, like bike rides hikes.

Why go bike rides hike? That's pretty much what's keeping sane (I live residential area edge country). I'm pretty sure safe things long crowded. point every report cluster cases came one event - party, funeral, etc. - cite 4, maybe 6 10 cases....

Fine, 9,500 NEW cases happened one day ONE state?

To like front page story newspaper couple people hit lightning walking dog - someone contracted flesh-eating bacteria swimming Louisiana - leading likely ways gonna die **so need ban dog-walking swimming.** Nothing 100%. might one lucky ones. scientists say covid like FutureCancer strike 20-30 years line form conditions moment, proven vaccine lucky, one two successful candidates end year

The headline means fully distributed globally. Lots countries get doses immediately approval. Damn, sounds 1:1 happening UK. World's gone mad! Sure can. count pneumonia more, Covid hospitalizations fatality rate incredibly low

Then join army fight wars.

Fatality rate also pretty low say covid got low rate.

This complicated virus sadly politics wrapped around corona. this, plus policies mandates actually protect (/us) Uhhh allowed go outside, doesn‚Äôt transmit well outdoors especially distance others test blood anymore? take people‚Äôs word shrug say well aren‚Äôt paying they‚Äôd reason lie?
I mean, people evil would lie matter compensation hope still test it.

Sure, students lower infection rate (although may shift like 20-30 yr olds) hundreds, sometimes thousands students building. close contact. 7 hours day. 5 days week. make feel better.

I acknowledge right arms isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnatural right‚Äù

The right bear arms natural right. I‚Äôve never said otherwise.

Again don‚Äôt understand concept natural rights. don‚Äôt want tourists logic flawed .... realize also mean grocery store shut power plant shut waste management shut down... think hospital shut too... cause know... workers would sue workplace ... fires stations def need shut down. Life matters right..... I'm even thinking wine dinner I've fully recovered autoimmune vasculitis ruled out.

I started bruising NSAIDs, never happened getting sick, also get random knifing pain major arteries, really want exacerbate sickness. feel like affected circulation. workplace NOTHING norm, criticized calling sick.  findings draw question studies saying Coronavirus around since 2019 West? sound bogus now.  well trained normally make 18-19$/hour I‚Äôm happy proud that. friend regularly makes $10/hr bringing home 1000 week working got CHOOSE continue make versus working even though isn‚Äôt higher risk anyone else job open. 

This legal. friend breaking law choosing work collecting unemployment. work entire pandemic; someone get CHOOSE unemployment end making more?

This exactly said. want feel better amount making.  They? Dude grew Miami. You‚Äôre wrong. lock everything NOW.

Don't worry Florida. governor jumped quick ban ""alcohol consumption bars"". measures even reported 9636 new daily cases. word ""masks"" like ""climate change"" become illegal speak loud State employees here. I‚Äôm sure comment section civil. 

Really though, protesting outside wearing mask, wildly different inclosed space without mask. 

This logic flu spreads easier winter. Folks smushed inside, meaning viruses free reign spreading. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ago dying something work used considered evil. can't normalize pandemic.

An excellent point. I‚Äôm sick argument.

Where would want put sick elderly? mild symptoms, want go home.

Nursing homes aren‚Äôt best place live folks it‚Äôs home. every right able go illness manageable.

How would like told can‚Äôt leave hospital even though you‚Äôre sick?

The law protect elder rights much hospital capacity old people still humans still deserve comfortable home held prisoner hospitals. nothing available. strange shortage supposedly. would head temp, would go, wear n95/kn95. Blood donors know process slow, got ""bad vibe"" checkin health screening, laying captive needle arm situation wanted 20+ mins.  I'm sure Mr. DeSantis something say rise cases.. 'Well, bird hand worth two bush.' 'Well, apple day keeps doctor away' Gross. That's far. Reading intently.

‚ÄúThe ones treating normal investigations, nothing see plain chest x ray signs infection, inflammation, blood clots laboratory tests. many worried, understandably so.‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

Found interesting. mind incredibly powerful wouldn‚Äôt surprise due extreme worldwide panic susceptible people symptom generated thoughts. However, objective physical tests show fine, that‚Äôs important thing possibly important takeaway me. Lol greedy? majority population shopping hours anyways. worked grocery store. It‚Äôs dead 9-10 I‚Äôd pissed work spiking pandemic check someone every half hour. 

Also, Wegmans originally closed night swarms people panic buying needed additional time restock disinfect. told doctor thought ADD I'm jumping various hoops get treatment. hard enough admit. That's new personal record! Even don‚Äôt wear mask, social distancing important mask wearing. aren‚Äôt using logical fallacy. ‚Äúfacts‚Äù beliefs based incorrect. whol argument based earth flat, argument would invalid.

Also it‚Äôs personal attack, it‚Äôs simply stating fact. objectively aren‚Äôt intelligent enough conversation. 

There logical inconsistency. I‚Äôm sure thought mistaken. 

That‚Äôs natural rights work dude. government restricting right doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt still right. means government something shouldn‚Äôt do. Rights exist INDEPEDENT government. 

You parroting points evidence. 

I suggest read Locke. Maybe learn talking try. 


Tbh I‚Äôm kinda disappointed someone would spend much time defending idea government whatever wants you, guess that‚Äôs way  ""This study uses newly collected data protests 315 largest U.S. cities estimate impacts mass protests social distancing COVID-19 case growth...we find evidence urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest onset.¬†"" appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* would explain disproportionate amount Karen‚Äôs popping thats issue good answer asymptomatic people infect others. lack much data illness take year(s) get handle restaurant bar owner found violation governor‚Äôs orders faced second degree misdemeanor punishable 60 days jail $500 fine. fines levied enforcement action taken 335 cases

Laws worthless enforced particular laws could easily enforced reducing outbreak deaths Florida. Florida beach community, continue see businesses flagrantly violate laws recommendations without enforcement consequences.

We may never see individual citizens held fully responsible, businesses could easily regulated (and lives saved) political leaders gave damn. lawyer, given circumstances outlined, could argued reasonable employer told stay home forced work community spread significant. 30,000 new confirmed infections U.S. every day, going working job somewhere. Obviously haven‚Äôt got mate /s nuclear bombs?

The thing actually support limits arms already, previously discussed.

You acknowledge implicitly right arms ""natural right"", already stated people allowed particular type weapon. mention obvious point definition ""natural right"", owning guns way conforms defintion.

You ignoring logical inconsistency argument, also calling unintelligent.  pre covid. Shit. Yes, marijuanas essential. Well meningitis unknown origin held extra CSF could confirmatory testing now. Frankly don‚Äôt see could distinguish COVID-meningitis seronegative meningitis within antibody testing. think it‚Äôs safe bet look lot worse right now, barring miracle. know exponential growth right? speak soon. negative. point every report cluster cases came one event - party, funeral, etc. - cites 4, maybe 6 10 cases - mere TINY, miniscule fraction total number cases....

Yes and? 9000 infected, expect us get 900 reports every day Florida?

The point is, big outdoor events big problem contagion WOULD many stories happening - there.

I've following corona since January, seen single outdoor event. many stories like ""50 infected wedding, 30 infected bar"". Fine, 9,500 NEW cases happened one day ONE state?

Since cannot referred big outdoor events, must caused something else. 

Note well small % population took part protests, much bigger % population indoor events, like go bars, churches, family reunions.

They reopened bars, restarants, etc, spreading. simple.

Close number sick people: Spread goes down.

Open number sick people: Spread goes up. first die, taking families them. Let it. Username checks out. Congrats Either dies I'm saying. report police health officials. Gotta look others Ooo...ladies gentlemen we‚Äôve got responsible model citizen right here. Docile, agreeable scared, exactly authorities‚Äô favorite types plannedemic. 

Let angel judge others he/she wants he/she‚Äôs clean, righteous infallible. $1.4B sent dead people could used run antibody tests half population. Calm keyboard-warrior, don‚Äôt know aware EVERYONE could opinion including me, don‚Äôt like mine doesn‚Äôt make enemy. Breathe, going ok. Imagine caring fellow human like (c‚Äômon America)

Hyperindividualism death us rate. Essential oils, idiot... understand, went back time talked ancient (like pre-Christian world) Hebrew faith, told thought Adam Eve actually, literally existed, even back likely would laughed ass called idiot. cloth mask decrease risk infection. increases cannot filter well enough stays wet collected spores spread. Stupid always existed large quantities people. bad bot, go away, one likes Definitely Holy shit thats awful. people still walk around screaming hoax another flu.   Look pal, dinosaurs never existed. scam made fake media scare people buying caves. You‚Äôre played Yeah, force people sick covid-19 work! could go wrong? Yeah, lump bunch things ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù it‚Äôs flu, it‚Äôs marketing flu vaccines. Uh no? It‚Äôs BS someone working make less someone would normally make less ISN‚ÄôT.

I well trained normally make 18-19$/hour I‚Äôm happy proud that. friend regularly makes $10/hr bringing home 1000 week working got CHOOSE continue make versus working even though isn‚Äôt higher risk anyone else job open. 

I work entire pandemic; someone get CHOOSE unemployment end making more? Forget dying, many going risk life long health issues?  That's shame I'm really morbidly curious India do. many hurdles overcome unique challenge. hope well. Well let's clear here. China use force lock people down. Literally sealing doors in. I'm freedom loving American, even see moment time authoritarian gov produce... Results. really? Arabic speaker prompted look meaning ‚Äòal-Qaeda‚Äô google told means ‚Äòthe base‚Äô ‚Äòthe leaders‚Äô

Where peace come in? thing recovered now. news like 3 months old lol  States purposely covering numbers, think really give fuck. one predict going play month future. chances seem high we‚Äôll see many current deaths fall comes along complacency many places. Dude, tl;dr four paragraphs, even bother it? Thank Defending rights fellow man obligation him. 

(Yes man includes women anyone even tries) I'm sure America knew wanted holiday Europe would've worn masks. mask, lack representation. 

Historically, oppression starts ""public good"" using emergency powers executive order. Japanese internment started executive order, example. 

Lawmakers dragging ass passing specific authorization clear timeline criteria root conflict. relief bill actually adequate made financially possible people quarantine, mandatory masks sitting never issue. 

Yes, wear masks people idiots understand freedoms private property work, mean broader legal issue keep mind. Actually, Americans nowadays pretty respectful tourists Europe, least experience. YES. Airborne aids. People called crazy talked knew Yea get covid immediately. likely cold. Stay safe  confirm - want CFS. nagging enough doctors long enough, they‚Äôll cycle meds melatonin Ambien give none works, resorting oh-so-common, ‚Äútry changing daily routine.‚Äù


Like haven‚Äôt spent last two decades without improvement healthcare system falling apart even reaching peak one wants talk sub.

Testing rate also abysmally low certain states like Telangana. get people infected stated above. ones happy guys infecting forced go work paid stayed home.

Cold air blowing around, one wearing masks, boisterous crowds sitting bar, hour. could possibly go wrong? fuck u guys still discussing this? ""Oh exemption card department Justice? May see it?

Mine distinctly started right shingles.
Either way, really hope see much CFS COVID wish anyone. ruined quality life. black *my* windows night.   
With fresh air I‚Äôll get hypoxia! seriousness, what‚Äôs like actually drink now? I‚Äôve found beers helped.

I'm still going stick delivery, work home life otherwise. post covid experience inflammation. entire life I've slight bit psoriasis underneath left eye. light hardly noticeable.

It's full blown post covid. Around eyes temples middle forehead.

My doctor says he's going document give usual said know enough. shut already, Gaytes? situation like this, really ready approval given. Exclusively even. would've saved 1% money lost equity pAY 100% taxes year free income two month strict quarantine everybody could exit Corona lives

If everyone strictly stayed home get two months. rich makee taxes back thru equity  virus seeks healthy hosts replicate thrive. guess Mr. Trump truly safe Coronavirus. 2 months?
Hey, honestly, you‚Äôre explaining exact symptoms starting back February. fit beforehand though. won‚Äôt boring explain everything had, honestly feel like I‚Äôm reading situation comment, without ulcerative colitis. 

There‚Äôs good news though. starting get bummed couldn‚Äôt breathe properly anymore, now, almost 5 months later, I‚Äôve noticing finally breathe deeply again, energy finish full exercise couldn‚Äôt done 2 months ago. 

So even though know everyone‚Äôs different, maybe there‚Äôs hope you‚Äôll get back full capacity soon! Good luck everything. Cant, im gay. Care ask old are? 

Not could possibly invalidate anything, I'm curious. Time High song movie Octopussy cums mind! Perfect trump thinks machismo bond actually scared little pussy tweets rather lead difficult times Ignorant Governors care economy, people 'the dangerous spreaders'. . Ironically gyms best position become one safer ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù industries. Enforced capacity high-risk population hours, easily implemented contact tracing via digital check in/out, increased sanitization, equipment spaced encourage social distancing, site staffing educate enforce policies (which added benefit keeping people employed), bare minimum required state fitness facilities reopen. Gyms don‚Äôt need close, gyms need evolve.

Also record - ‚Äúpushups shit‚Äù enough keep state atrophy, comes actual strength training corrective care (ie people recovering traumatic injuries reoccurring conditions) need access different equipment flat isn‚Äôt realistic home space, that‚Äôs even beginning touch dangers undertaking exercise routine without proper instruction. That's know going fun time. collection stories heard podcast people getting adulthood realizing certain fundamental truths.

That's literally article says. Unfortunately country. still pay ‚Ç¨300 think that's bit false dichotomy. There's kinds issues Indians collectively function unit. think others mentioned propensity illnesses makes enacting self regulatory measures prevent spread - especially India poor people unable afford healthcare makes amenable preventive measures towards epidemics. Definitely safer outside winter season terrifying. 100% proven virus pretty safe assumption. Fair enough, know till time goes hear good word? God put skeletons test faith.

For real though, good them. hell time it, I‚Äôm glad things getting better. Sorry, overly simplified useful. one person get sick country 1 million, need test 5,000 people. need test person, perhaps 20 contacted. 400 contacted them. 421 tests enough test three contact layers deep.

Also, selection bias: people can't afford tested positive volunteering tested. Even mild symptoms, choice tough starve, tough out. 

Also tests equal. one thing testing every person white house every day, another thing testing every server bars wiping tables handling glassware.

Finally, can't test way pandemic symptoms show *after* infectious. also mitigate spread.

This kind over-simplified math brings people false sense security. woefully inadequate say ""we testing"" also contact tracing, coupled strong economic safety nets discourage people coming forward. chiropractic now. Yup two candidates. showed good phase I/2 results. Yeah, that‚Äôs flattening curve means. Slowing infection rate enough time gear health care system handle influx patients.

I can't even imagine many employees McDonalds Chipotle tested+ that's never communicated customer. George Washington know dinosaurs existed. goto grocery store trips see someone wihh mask. I'm sure got told wear get point. thus far conceivable could mutate change ways performs

You know term means right? where?!?  know handful people genuinely believe thy government going microchip us corona virus vaccines control us use 5G towers. It‚Äôs unfortunate, really, people genuinely believe crap I'm Canada I've shocked everyday watching here, like living 1 world watching news dystopian nightmare.

I advocate Chiropractic because, works best current dynamics. start single parent, mutate multiple strains viruses.

Just like covid. entire concept needs scrapped, corporations abuse staff staff choice stick out.

The fact happening many people right system coming stress, people never trapped job.

The system UK prove actively seeking employment, nothing last job all. main reason people take vaccine immediately won‚Äôt opportunity long term testing side effects vaccines go released public. Humanity long brutal history punishing corrupt negligent leaders; also short memory.  Spanish flu killed 675k America. estimated 50 million deaths covid nearing 500k worldwide get wrong, covid bad, far (and hopefully never) scale Spanish flu 1918

thats literarily said. 675k didnt think needed clear america american wars together. truly end life know it? teach ""pre-"" means American schools? want spread facts? oh lol Regardless, dry tinder, fire eventually find it. That's inevitable. pick pace epidemic. can't forego it. Ultimately, way past it. ran back r/conservative Spanish flu lowest estimate 11 MILIONS WORST 100 get took 675k

675k inside america. GA doesnt give fuck. We‚Äôre next get hammered Florida‚Äôs done. LMFAO. gave fuel destroy entire argument piece piece still say *well it‚Äôs still possible... * yes it‚Äôs possible probable however guess what, experts areas relevant discussion agree:**it‚Äôs fucking likely** 

And say vaccine? **that you‚Äôre wrong.** let‚Äôs ignore part everything else brought though right? Haha it‚Äôs glaringly obvious overall understanding anything discussion *seriously* stunted. I'm highly educated hate antivaxx nonsense, trying hard contract COVID. There's way I'm getting vaccine completed, full size, double blind RCT. 

The US UK governments blatantly rushing fix disastrous mismanagement resulting economic collapse. Sorry, get point. making argument worth shutting economy, basically agreeing put people without antibodies (including people cannot develop all) risk. saying, social perspective, would better way locking economies protect people virus. 

Herd immunity achieved find vaccine, 5 odd % people cannot develop antibodies protected everyone else antibodies. I'm ""big rocks meet big sky"" instead ""big water meets sand"", places crowded time year too. wrong, relevant.  research virus shows outdoors virus becomes weak fast. Keepin social distance enough masks make difference.

So unless staying closer 3 ft others long periods time, risk extremely small People read SHC014. lab made Frankenstein monster virus far fetched, literally physically existed 2015. already done real rain.  Could pay say stereotypical Italian phrases exaggerated accent? ADA? Factory farming harmful - animals, people, environment. needs stop. a-hole a-hole are, support nurses, doctors, supermarket employee quit. A-holes die responsible people take over. healthy younger people end line (rightfully so, saying) 

They might be. [A vaccine might effective older, at-risk that's case better vaccinating younger population currently spreading older population. No, practicing selective reading. say every indoor space, said every indoor space unmasked people close proximity. people wear masks, visit briefly, stay apart, science tells us probably fine. I'm seeing alot people cover nose mask. Wtf? Yep. People lie ‚Äúare right thing?‚Äù kind polls. Cuomo really say people nursing homes safer home? That's terrible look considering ordered nursing homes accept positive patients. Lol, go pegged Sherlock pathetic see. Absolutely attempt social distancing masks. Sounds like got Yale baseball skills. knew dumb jocks high school ended Ivy Leagues still take science classes. every dipshit extra hundred bucks cell phone participate fucking awful.

I've Internet 25 years, noticed anything cool that's 'under radar' tends go shit whenever masses find it. Hell, time Facebook actually nice alternative shit show Myspace. frontal lobe damageüò¢ honest time don‚Äôt need advocating. need MANDATING. Wearing masks cannot choice purpose mask primarily protect mask user people around. wear mask near negligent person mask doesn‚Äôt much person used it. US lacks real president needs take charge understand masks required using underwear dressed. say smh. Florida's leadership done everything wrong start. Cuz Muricans hard wear goddamn mask. Fucking snowflakes. healthy college kids watch mom grandpa die get drank on, feel ounce guilt shame?
MURICA: GET DESERVE! YAY FREEDUMBS !! feel way. figure since I‚Äôm already buckled tight, need work preparing sensation impacts. Lighter SPARKS outbreak  didn‚Äôt say sole metric. said ‚Äúa‚Äù metric

I ask states like Florida Texas Arizona focused places messed response up. However compare total deaths states like Michigan New York, places whose response applauded, far deaths. 

Texas 2500 deaths. Florida 3300. 

Michigan 6000. New York 35,000

Yet Cuomo Whitmer widely praised. 

Do long term effects apply Michigan NY? deaths, populations less risk long term effects? 

How could total deaths relevant factor? sole, quite barometer success US testing 650,000 per day need lie. 
 I‚Äôm sure could errors message, lies.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible guarantee single form protection give 100% safety real world conditions. Controlling every variable even difficult laboratory. don‚Äôt live, work go school laboratory. Vaccines act inhibit spread virus population. vaccine, need adopt alternate strategies inhibit virus barriers; either physical ones increased space. 

Masks reduce transmission rates virus, virus tends ride aerosols much larger virus itself. inexpensive barrier mouth nose stop *all* particles passing around it, inhibits particles; size viral load one proven factors influencing rate virus multiply body overload immune system naturally respond. 

So one wearing masks least safe, everyone wearing masks safe, populations may possibly vulnerable even smaller viral loads supported increasing distance potential carriers, allowing smaller crowd exposure early ‚Äúsenior hour‚Äù shopping, even staying home receiving deliveries.‚Äù companies vaccine works. ""Some time"" lot work here. Maybe drop old set Chernobyl TV series HBO? bet props sharp edges splinters. I'd cool that. school district put plans reopen yesterday read news article parents arms it. initially thought people would like me...like way hell sending child back school...but weren't. angry school going open full time, 5 days week need work need childcare. 

I sending kids back. care repeat grade it. killing anyone, especially grandma lives us, potentially dying. give shit. many people restaurant. staff wear masks? still important thing understand. see restaurant bar trying enforce rules still largely rely patrons also following rules. Trying kick probably work well owners likely want kick due loss revenue they've already suffered. They'll cover asses saying ""we everything supposed patrons follow rules. We're liable."" shrug continue business usual. cant true Ya it‚Äôs starting make sense now. Thanks. Btw posted comment 4 times idk lagging something haha. far seems worked (at least Netherlands, masks required using public transport), key numbers deaths IC/hospital admissions low (and still slowly declining further) despite started roll back restrictions month ago. I'm sure see plenty localized flare-ups, decent contact-tracing infrastructure enough testing capacity place I'm cautiously optimistic mitigated shit hits fan. hand, goddamned virus thrown us curve balls ready for, ultimately everyone part hoping best realistically do. I'm glad live somewhere much ask population (or least large enough portion population). else put them? way alcohol is. disagree too? First world country good long. Making good part general public entitled hell, thinking world revolves around rights valuable people's lives. sad hilarious try understand crowd. There‚Äôs already like 100 vaccines remember correctly, think moderna supported one. people replied ""Remind Me"" weeks ago, comments see back ""aged like milk""? fact, testing quite risky way done, switched spit test instead swabs. do, course, realize obese children children underlying conditions still children, therefore still sad die, right?  fuck gonna stop whole world 3 weeks? ? assessment sounds normal organic 33,000? 33,001? 32,995? number 33,000 spit examples wearing masks time lines same.  


I wearing masks, studies ""hope"" annoying. want harsh reality please, sugar coated crap. Huh? Please enlighten me. can't imagine mindset goes much effort avoid something easy.  

Just put mask maybe half hour store take leave. lazy attitude towards pandemic. difficult keep 3 ft away people times. constant work.

Just look numbers. US country obsessed masks really working well it. I'm sure you, point, figure world figured long time ago change focus something actually works. sad many people die mean time. nature pandemic lends conspiracy theories, sub place indulge conspiracy theories I've echoing since told come back work restaurant I'm employed at. come back lose job. 700 plus cases yesterday live seems insane people want sit dining room lounge area eat room complete strangers. constantly feel like I'm either gonna get covid everything shut again. Testing 650,000 people per day likely will, given leave office late January best. Good point, looking numbers reported, follow general pattern countries. Italy strict lockdown think Italian authorities quite trustworthy. (Would different Berlusconi still charge - turn back within 10 km radius).

Here daily numbers Worldometers:  Lol, proof besides Facebook articles. actually think provided concrete evidence? so, you‚Äôre naive fool. Canada! Time start drinking Clorox get ready defeat virus get appeal bars. Can't people drink alone home, crying dark, like normal person? difficult situation. I'm sure mayors, etc. joined trying show support hopes would end sooner. protesting kind considered essential activity.  sure you‚Äôre actually replying to, case counts. nothing death counts. Definitely case checking user name would helped üòâ yet, using American technology. üòÄ gave blood tested positive antibodies. Big surprise! one day March couldn‚Äôt smell. it.  It‚Äôs scary I‚Äôve done everything ‚Äòright‚Äô, work home, grocery pickup, etc. much likely get vaccine not, would feel safe betting life it. 

Getting vaccine vaccine effective unfortunately two different things. There's serious concern covid-19 vaccine [might effective aging needs most. Yes restrictions lasted three times longer Italy honestly googling ""random sudden cough"" month ago. I'm starting believe may mild symptoms covid 3-4 months ago

Never felt sick, maybe week 2 annoying frequent usual dry cough. week slight fatigue/mental fog (although drinking fairly often time, still felt different hangover). Finally stupid nowhere mini cough basically like sharp exhale (since idea cough take breath prepare). several months

Thanks sharing info, hope coughing gets better leaders put best responsible mom / dad voice uttered something along lines going open up, going safe way.

At time said akin bleary eyed buddy going drive drunk, I‚Äôm going safe way.

The thing proposing inherently unsafe, can‚Äôt magic risk away tacking words.

The absolutely mind boggling thing re-opening leisure services clearly represent risk public safety, especially cases, viable reasonable alternatives infrastructure already widely available use.

-	Dining restaurant. Restaurants to-go / take-away / carry / delivery service long time. Tired eating shit food know cook, that‚Äôs fine go get something out, bring back, eat it. There‚Äôs safe way dine indoors right now, can‚Äôt wear mask eat, AC blowing around virus, eat shared plates, utensils, cups.
-	Going bar. enjoy refreshing beverage tine time myself, here‚Äôs newsflash though, stores sell alcohol drink home. Wow, mind blown. might argue going bar isn‚Äôt consuming alcohol, rather night people. Yes, unsafe, drunk people get sloppy masks (and rules general) people one emotional huggers / shouters / etc inebriated, getting bunch together confined space constantly touching / removing masks (or likely wearing begin with) recipe disaster.
-	Going movies. Could maybe alright concession stands shut down, given profit centers theater unlikely, shut makes whole exercise even futile. Movies streamed tv, computer, phone, etc. Sitting giant air conditioned Petri dish, touching / removing / foregoing mask shovel priced popcorn / candy face, seems like great way spread disease.

I‚Äôm saying keep people working / utilizing necessary services. services though high degree risk alternative, food delivery pickup, consuming alcohol home, watching Netflix / Hulu / etc, common, effective ways get service safely.

We wanted believe special, virus would check scorecard see good did, months lockdown, take pity us. screaming toddler won‚Äôt eat vegetables demands cookies dinner instead, upset belly ache. Where? Hospitalizations going Texas, Fl, Arizona. Florida‚Äôs big state. maybe area hit hard, hospital desperate elective surgery revenue. well damned damned situation it? Anytime Trump mentioned closing borders, democrats flipped Exactly. Honestly, surprised knew word ""apathy"" knew ""indifference""! english speakers learn two words way around... Well, U.S. least. wind affect it

In likelihood, increased wind would reduce necessary separation. But, right know sure acting guidelines hypotheses, established science. Lmao yep. Unfortunately ppl infect bet. I'm SC, far tell, nothing done. reopened everything ""back normal."" Yes often work groups 3. say ""do anyone disagrees bot?"" order gaslight you. think shining light stands benefit they're saying helpful refuting content. need talk much often see discussed sub. no, they're questioning contact tracing - 9,500 new cases one day, expect reports 10, 20, came one mall, one factory, one event, one rally, etc...

Almost everyday kind stories get posted here?

I seen malls tbh. Neither ""rallies"", unless count religious events rallies. 

Religious events caused contagion events since February. guess simply matter religion, stand/sit close together indoors often sing.

Meat plants often like 500, 1000 sick stands bit dishonest media pushing argument get-togethers big cause obviously fall flat faces trying prove it.

IDK, reading media 4 different languages corona.

And stories posted Korea, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, India, Germany, Italy, forth. vountries world pretty much. 

For sure media entire world ""in"" conspiracy. :)

You read virologists say straight also, want to. general say yeah outdoor spread happen, indoor spread much worse.

- Another thing convinced protests bad HUGE protests places like Norway, Holland, etc. Everywhere Europe. nowhere Europe get spikes protests. I'll look soon. I'm happy admit I'm wrong, could well false memory. I‚Äôve named called, death rates, mocked repeatedly, laughed at, whole bunch things trying spread science disease. People violently it, bunch together attacks. can‚Äôt reason them, give facts call pussy sheep tell back hiding. 

I compassionate never wished death vengeance life. this? literally could care less increasing numbers among refused science. deserve whatever comes way. feel bad health care workers deal them. truly believe could use reset lot people longer us going forward. good thing come death maybe teach idiots friends passing. Feel free review thread. provided multiple sources. misleading dangerous headline People lie pollsters. 

You think stating condescending?

Pollsters aware it. Nothing like guns. Ahh yes like risk virus asymptomatic? üò≠

All spreading fear without even knowing virus attending ICU mom currently COVID. Basically told us doesn‚Äôt show signs recovery fourteen days, going remove ventilator make comfortable. multiple PE‚Äôs don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely.

So, doesn‚Äôt seem like ICU‚Äôs letting patients low chances recovery stay weeks. needs study reliable kind studies are. definitely far truth. There‚Äôs waiting 90-180 day probationary period get health benefits either? What? think depends live. town seems 80/20 friend lives Arizona says town 20/80. What? virologist understanding coronaviruses mutate slowly general replication code check system built verify replication successful. 

This mean *no* mutations, they've clearly identified various strains different parts world let track spread. means slower mutations. put programming terms - virus's replication code unit test built in. mean bugs, far fewer bugs viruses unit test (like influenza.) Heh heh cleavage Pimps lowest scum scum find. Despite sex work legal Bangladesh, women girls cited article working outside legal sex industry, beaten pimps producing enough income Actually said he‚Äôs even noticed spike now. It‚Äôs one cares quarantine anymore. Even still wearing masks still choose wear gloves stores now, feel like one else around is. say? California residents still travel NY without restrictions?  spoke family members? world casino owners would least one shift week dealing black jack serving drinks random guests.

We thing called OSHA. whole concept agency enforces workplace safety regulations.

They BBP (blood born pathogen standard) however apply COVID-19, OSHA‚Äôs Bloodborne Pathogens standard ([29 CFR applies occupational exposure human blood potentially infectious materials typically include respiratory secretions may contain SARS-CoV-2 (unless visible blood present). However, provisions standard offer framework may help control sources virus, including exposures [body (e.g., respiratory secretions) covered standard. 

(I love part basically state apply unless there's blood involved)

However, general duty clause requires employers avoid hazardous work General Duty Clause, [Section [Occupational Safety Health (OSH) Act 29 USC 654(a)(1), requires employers furnish worker ""employment place employment, free recognized hazards causing likely cause death serious physical harm."" 

I realize disease crop anywhere OSHA cannot monitor every potential disease certainly recognized hazard. pretty radical read article, apparently...given article body says, ""There's need feel leery grocery store."" headline telling people grocery stores safe. actual conclusion drawn reporter. Paywall Personally, find incivility detracts argument. Perhaps think hides it, people bother engaging enough demonstrate you?

Either way, I've supported argument evidence, can't even support argument evidence. 7% people restaurants shopping like pandemic never happened, gonna see 7% often 80% hiding home like be. also explains really nicely. +8500 Florida.

Tons people going hotspots right took seriously month, started sharing anti-mask propaganda stupid Plandemic videos, look reason undermine science related COVID. point we‚Äôre far beyond ‚Äúmasks save us‚Äù mode.

We need stop going non-essential high risk places immediately. walk park fine, drink bar not. used ‚Äò *evidence* ‚Äò argument... twice. understands process developing argument would recognize I‚Äôm saying

Nobody understands you‚Äôre saying experts sources aren‚Äôt even saying you‚Äôre saying lmfao. embarrassed? Flatten curve give scientists time find treatments prevent hospitals run. goal fewer people get virus, completely depends person's behavior. People selfish lockdowns people can't trusted take precautions help stop spread. Case point, people still say masks nothing infringe rights refuse wear one also refusing stay public. Well. fine even works younger theory long 80% population protected beach, itself. side activities outing may concerning - shopping, dining, etc. that's differences state come int. NJ enforces mask compliance commercial areas whereas FL not, - importantly - huge culture defiance NJ like south (the 15,000 deaths humbling, addition underlying political differences regions). 

So, agree sentiment beach-going, stand alone activity, dangerous, additional factors consider assessing huge crowds beaches Florida implication spread covid. three heart attacks town Brazil counted Covid.

Two doctors. One 60 y.o. working, otherwise picture health.

The other, thrombosis/vascular issues already 37 y.o. sudden decline ordinary pre-existing condition.

Third heard little about. one earliest area.

I bet time done we'll adding ""cardiac/vascular"" excess deaths get best counts, excess pneumonia. Back February went after-hours event Magic Kingdom WDW. place empty. walked every ride. almost never ran people. compartment monorail myself. one tram back car. asked CM capacity events said 1-2%. could probably doubled capacity wouldn‚Äôt made difference. kind capacity limits need place now.

(Not *right now*. Florida shit show right now, I‚Äôm talking vaccine available.)

For want understand like, check vloggers YouTube. lot got press invites cover events. quickly backtracked claims FB page... someone ICU weeks, live going person before. 1/3 people go back ot normal physical/cognitive function long term ICU stays. rest cognitive issues similar people early-onset Alzheimers. need psychical therapy emotional therapy PTSD. majority long term ICU patients leave anti-psychotics need previously. It‚Äôs hard all, that‚Äôs whole point. rough you‚Äôre wearing one running usually people aren‚Äôt running, they‚Äôre arrogant.

Everybody knows wear PPE people feel don‚Äôt need make excuse. 

I‚Äôve worked people set 40‚Äô scaffolding without lockouts, whole thing would shift I‚Äôd rope 100lb mortar brick.

People dumb shit. Nobody wants harness roof work fall deaths occur ten feet less. 

Masks use principles, safety equipment really.

All way back bike helmet. Humans often lie things ashamed of. 

Political leanings don‚Äôt really affect that. 

And I‚Äôm interested political baiting, we‚Äôve seen here. thanks admitting baiting interested in. America, cases rising fast daily deaths still quite low? cant use surveys information people answer think survey wants answer. fine, get personal loans, federal ones. start making payments school six months there's sorts programs place overwhelmed payments. Definitely go every grant scholarship can, make sure pester school financial assistance -- sometimes they'll assign case worker help track every bit financial aid can. There's much way COVID works still know. 

80 year old people get it...twice...and still live. here, two millennials got dropped dead real symptoms immunocompromised disease/underlying condition. 

COVID board demographically. Travel restriction key. States high case counts yet limit incomings business essential business. maybe able stay open states way. Start acting like individual countries like all've wanted be. can't count Fed moment. least vaccine comes out. Sounds pretty similar lockdown Canada we're similar pace cases deaths Italy. Allegheny county PA probably gonna need close again. It‚Äôs looking good :( viruses thrive cold temperatures. pick frozen package virus it, put freezer, virus could survive way thaw still active. 

people also tend breathe harder cough cold environments. let‚Äôs honest they‚Äôre probably taking mask couple hours shift.

plus gotta think they‚Äôre lunch breaks, sitting around mask down. 

it‚Äôs workers standing assembly line mask on. Learned exactly? Ah man.. tried local red cross totally botched donation. never got antibody test :( what?

we still new disease killed least much flu one year 1/3 year totally depends town. grocery store? Yeah people wear mask. Restaurants bars? Absolutely not. Virus spread deaths indeed falling... lockdown. ""I think trump said"" brain fried? still believe says? read vasectomy/tubal ligation consider ""strongly"". Guess pretty easy lose control virus outbreak government incompetent part population empathy human beings brain cells critical thinking. Looks like way US learn good ol Darwinism Also would like point flu anything tame. son got last year despite flu vaccine, actually hospitalized awhile.

I'm denying there's obvious cases people recovering going suffer long time it, case viruses illnesses? portion people unfortunately pass away, portion people recover somewhat without long term effects, majority make full recovery. know anyone would risk vigilant social distancing, fact matter virus prevalent medicine vaccine we're going learn live safely School boards: ‚ÄúSCHOOLS REOPEN FALL‚Äù

I'm American tbh I'm glad I'm not. don‚Äôt see reopening could result another surge. It‚Äôs impossible. either lockdown forever don‚Äôt. post history unhinged t_d shit i've ever seen. Gotta start growing shit. Correct I‚Äôm wrong:
You believe Coronavirus weakens outside, right? It‚Äôs relevant. makes statement ignorant. Every store go every single person mask on. governor New Jersey made mandatory hasn‚Äôt issue. Family wanted host Father's Day celebration, already opened circle another family. asked us bring utensils, sit another part house yard, etc. also small child.

I get precautions, stressful said we'd stay home. [i would posit signal noise ratio much higher hell know. Didn‚Äôt know Bill Gates Obama made virus lab China spread 5G waves control us all.

/s case. Especially contact tracers told specifically exclude mention protest don‚Äôt hate god, ignorant people use god reason harm others shirk responsibility. Counterargument: wear mask. yep, years data idea. simple fix depend COVID mutate existence, deep shit Florida, lucky 7% population even owns mask.  I'm trying find title misleading care explain?  Start said several times, knows bit % is? said several times, high cost, low benefit, makes sense really expensive places, like submarines.

even 1% goes directly person person, infection result. viral load billions possible install filters air vents. already lol.
we talking air filters proven filter virus, assured (legally) so. ie HEPA filters. anyone install rag call filter very, materials designs block things small virii.

if repeat give another chance think answer points weaknesses (rigid) thinking. protraying - two people sitting next present much smaller distance virus travel distance person filter. en route filter, virii certain enter people. viral load per breath likely billions. absolutely correct, reason companies act responsibly crisis like this. Countries simply copy medicine, medicine scarce/too expensive. Thank you. ironic thing lot things outraged due COVID gross pandemic. I‚Äôm you, still buying stuff. think it‚Äôs going local farms meat free this. know would call Americans stupid. elect Trump president though. anyone website completely polarized? Reddit really exhausting lately. People continuing claim coronavirus high risk causing long term effects, yet one single study this, anecdotes. every virus cause long term effects, even influenza.

Remember NY began conducting serology tests April indicated death rate much lower thought? website quick brush studies yet ‚Äúscientifically peer reviewed‚Äù. Well neither claims long term effects! hypocritical? Sweet, sounds like nobody wants work anymore problem developed automation yet. Sounds like he‚Äôs impression people feel bad catching it.

That‚Äôs false. Nobody feels bad it, lots people feel schadenfreude however. Give America break, we‚Äôre best can. We‚Äôre rich advanced country like Vietnam New Zealand. bar lower 3rd world ratholes ours. job stare daggers shame fools they're public. I'm part. Western NY Definitely isn‚Äôt Beijing. Don‚Äôt trust totalitarian dictatorships saw crowded casino floors virtually everyone walking around without mask like 2019 TV, like watching car wreck slow motion.

Crazy. maddeningly crazy. attack naked shitting? Thank you. Ef... advice 5G chips injected vaccine control us! Wake sheep! Resist! /s case agree university professors general probably lean left I‚Äôd argue political spectrum across econ professors much diverse. probation period? covered time anyway (we 2 kinds health insurance - public = everyone private (""rich"" folks ) public ones fixed set services (TLDR: Everything restore health basically, fat belly removal etc) private ones bit better (Like single rooms hospitals, ""boss doctor"" treatment, etc) 

You forced join public one every employee job - McDonalds Office worker - pay % income (\~14%) service, unless earn 90.000$ year opt private ones (Going back hard - Private fees fixed law). Another option private ones self employed jobs (Be boss)

And CO-Pays also limited - either 5‚Ç¨ (Drugs) 10‚Ç¨ (1 night rehab clinic) (Ok, leaving dental work since thats ""complicated"") Everyone needs realize National News worthy protests looked like war zones one wearing masks tiny fraction . 
I know NY outside city ones local Long Island town ones dozens every week hundreds thousands people civilized masks looking like normal parade haven‚Äôt heard anyplace teachers ‚Äúout paid‚Äù - every school district I‚Äôve heard required teachers form distance learning. experience, teachers I‚Äôve spoken to, usually work in-person teaching. 

Furthermore, article doesn‚Äôt suggest teachers unwilling go back work; rather, suggests unwilling go back in-person teaching plan school reentry vague. Anecdotally, outdoors reasonable distance seems low spread scenario. Indoors close contact elevated respiratory activity seems killer. Normalizing probably biggest benefit governors order mask wear. It‚Äôs rule state people don‚Äôt, seen co workers don‚Äôt believe covid wearing masks stores social pressure mask wear here. wild many people make lot noise social value ancient text time argue sensible moral teachings (e.g. ""Am brother's keeper). Yea. Virus give fuck. [x] don‚Äôt much freedom America (applies every country) Virus spread low falling, deaths falling well. There's reason (in Italy) keep lockdown place. Spot on, Fuckin' Bob! Spot on! Translation: Doctors seeing similar things COVID-19 see respiratory disease causing lung inflammation. mean can't happen. oh, please

it's easy beat someone they've fighting different guy like 2 hours That‚Äôs fairly common. airline industry. using racist dogwhistle language? mean, hard comprehend. reopened brick mortar shop state guidelines thankfully past 3 weeks we‚Äôve handful people bitching masks one ridiculous ‚Äúexemption cards‚Äù. false dichotomy. choose masks social distancing, both. times = 80% actually ""most time""

Most time = times

Some time = wore mask like 2 minutes gets uncomfortable, since it. paper dispute protests spread virus amongst attending. basically says terrified general public enough cause social distancing overall, offsetting damage protest itself:

""The results consistent avoidance behavior part non-attending population. consistent literature crime, violence, perceived safety amongst general population, presence crime violence choose remain home often"". 


It follow large outside gatherings safe. I'm happy list assertions like :

- guarantee vaccine covid found.

- cure common cold.

- common cold mutation many different viruses strain requires different vaccine.

- guarantee vaccine one strain covid effective strains.

And I've backed every one assertions. done nothing copy-pasta without really undertanding argument was, let alone mine.

Like said though, incivility really encourage anyone bother correcting you. Really, talking gene sequence. knew nothing apart dead Chinese whistleblower doctors told us. I‚Äôd say assumptions pretty close based genome sequence. Yeah, think bigger problem people traveling there, getting infected, traveling back home spreading. infections deaths happening, happening states. Honestly, totally believe still live life too, smart it. sounds like guys great setup keep isolated, still fun. Read article. Possible facilities failing report covid cases deaths reporting. Pa seems including cases reported late. Seems like ppl butthurt there's fine reporting. I'd argue look recorded cases test positivity rates, make comparison. mean exactly? Well first time see word ""indifference"" medical context. words exist language rarely use ""indifference"" without complement (""indifference *to* something..."").     
I wondering physical psychological sense: insensibility pain, lack motivation, lack emotion, lack reaction, comatose state... countless studies showing that.

Here one modern economy requires international cooperation. much everyone would like self-sufficient possible economy built last century something change overnight. American companies construction industries able continue business long-term thing. Further, international travel USA huge source tourism revenue well. scratching surface. blame, him: ""No one ever got sick rallies, include me. Start church, get sick,"" says. ""I got Satan deemed get it. wanted quiet work, slow building church. That's about. world see that. Why? live behind veil. choose hate God."" basically following herd immunity, declare openly. care people. I'm urging set level acceptable risk behave accordingly. Bro, would let slide now. make next month extra pandemic cash, it. also depends live. area, cases gone down, still would feel safe serving drinks waiting tables. grocery store feel good Trader Joe‚Äôs. us instacart everything else die, file one ""mild symptons"" bucket. think lot coverage handled media (least live central US) -- deaths infected every broadcast. Nothing whatsoever potential side effects long term consequences. people, see mindset given this. they're risk group age low enough doctors saying, get sick week so, recover, importantly die. whole spectrum people thinking about. thus ridiculousness 'Herd Immunity' talk. millions around globe long lasting complications rest lives, easily preventable? Think long term cost. mind blowing hiding numbers related Covid19 plastered news. Since chy-nah hiding numbers big deal freedom information such. ü§îü§® police arrested protester wearing mask, would've sent right message others. Instead tear gassed, beat, flash banged protesters journalists indiscriminately. would pretty hysterical and/or insane, really Sweden, seriously suggest anyone government healthcare actively trying kill old people.

Sweden weird times creepy country, believe everything read eagerness shit it. Caregivers make mistakes every day media fucks distort. Except pattern new COVID cases follow pattern reopening pattern protests. realise reason ran tests? Better use tests checking cases severe, 38% positive rate means pretty much given attempt handling it. girlfriend lives miami still going like nothing wrong. gets sick, going take everything power say told so. say least!

For world's leading power, Donald Trump's management coronavirus pandemic clearly job. source detect positive 11 days infection? bad flu year.

I've like, super sick, twice. early 2009, bad flu year, early Jan. 2020, another really bad flu year.

Then, late March, husband got COVID (confirmed via antibodies), moderate case very, mild. haven‚Äôt watched WWE used would come sometimes cut promos daughter Charlotte women‚Äôs champion time  Inslee said enforce it. Stats WA counties last week (per (Seattle area): 38 deaths 
Yakima (middle): 14 
Snohomish (toward British Columbia): 4 
Pierce (includes Tacoma): 5 
Spokane (eastern): 1 
Island, Kitsap, Mason, Adams, Lewis, Jefferson, Clallam, San Juan, Pacific: 0

I'm going walk around Seattle shake hands, hug kiss people, guess understand Eastern Washington (1 death last week). China confirmed secretly working devil! hope Wuhan coronavirus pandemic end one day. people going beaches ones going restaurants. TWO WEEKS!

I love people predict apocalypse Florida. We've two weeks behind Lombardy three months now. SURE time apocalypse happen. got shingles young, 13 years old? flared itchy blistery rash side. symptoms go home cleared up. medication. Dad got shingles around 45 fucked bad! He‚Äôs fine though. wonder I‚Äôll get later :( China split Soviets Mao considered China third world like India, defer that. fairness, that's actual thing happened late 1800s. Everyone wanted credit discovering new dinosaur species, archaeologists really sleazy things. [Here's Wiki page invalidate dinosaurs though. numbers said lying . obviously believing putting 50k deaths either ppl nursing homes workers US. One would think would better county next mine 56% deaths nursing homes. 58 cases yesterday nursing home 11 deaths. live city younger even think nursing homes county.

I'm sure PTSD horrific. healthcare workers guinea pigs paved way. hope ppl treating like gods know despite odds great job we're thankful taking feat. Covid currently high times unlikely. That‚Äôs referring USAs numbers whole individual states. *Confirmed* cases time high today, disease likely not. 

In April confirmed cases 30thousands often 150k-200k tests. Percent positive 15% whole month. 

We‚Äôre 40k+ confirmed cases per day 400k-600k tests per day. last couple days apparent big spikes 600k+ days. 

So 2-4 times testing reveals 1.5 times cases. Covid widespread April, 2-4 times testing reveal least 2-4 times cases. Percent positive 6% although trending wrong direction. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll downvoted ‚Äúdownplaying situation‚Äù that‚Äôs I‚Äôm doing. anything I‚Äôm saying April worse give credit for. April would daily confirmed cases 60k 120k able test back much now.

I know someone whose dad (who older side preexisting condition) sent hospital COVID. severely ill family thought would die... eventually came slowly recovering. 

There still survival stories there. Sending good thoughts way. Don‚Äôt lose hope. Eventually see epidemic pick there. soon government takes foot brake, epidemic resume. know dude made Plandemic ""documentary"". know lot people think bringing truth. educated people left money. also think Q real. We're doomed. Oracle?! /s Can't get past paywall. someone put summary article? work restaurant NJ people behaving terribly already, would believe absolute stupidity lack concern see day long. much absolutely hate serving outside, allowing people going bad news. wasn‚Äôt responsible flattening curve. proud administration Seriously. CFS ruined life.

While personally aware research linking COVID-19 CFS specifically, point infectious diseases lot non-obvious long-term consequences. Like wart virus (HPV) associated cervical cancer, bacteria causes gingivitis associated Alzheimer's disease. Or, yes, viruses like Epstein-Barr virus associated CFS. Herd immunity getting started, shit around long time, India getting started. 

Still 3 states posting majority cases India. 
While opened month, 3 states continue remain hotbeds. 

Maharashtra Delhi Tamil Nadu Agreed, faking disability avoid wearing mask low life type act. people illegally obtain parking badges give access disabled parking spaces. stopped ordering food, since restaurants around seem safe. used pulse oxymeters immidiately detect breathing/oxygen issues within minutes, instead waiting days get test results.

It indeed smart entire life lockdown days unfortunately. many struggled isolation, loneliness inability leave home, life year now. Hopefully increased attention condition getting COVID lead research better treatment options. Take care stay safe! Regardless inequalities social classes, care local community, help reduce virus there. many Americans live bubble ""community"" care might counted one hand, one finger. thinking lot lately. read lips lot. difficult time understanding people masks on. I'm planning use technology TIME. I'm going type every part lesson pre-record whatever can. Since able physically group kids, likely use collaborative apps like pear deck Google docs, allow students communicate desks 6ft apart. certainly ideal, make work! Ironically they're same... make 4% worlds population 25% prison population. got minor case I'd covid end April. minor asthma life. still cough almost 3 months later. breathing still feel right. Also hard notice chorus naysayers globally condemning every move China made. now, Europe welcome citizens China, US. Nothing deadly, seems, arrogance backed ignorance. think article referred poverty=unhygenic conditions social distancing Horse shit. Technically true 100%.

This place lot migrants left respective states population reduce yes overall slums across Mumbai looks like slowly posting less numbers Mumbai still remains critical condition flu number calculation straight forward. based antiquated estimate I‚Äôm 22 mid-December, I‚Äôve athletic healthy whole life. Half year later lungs feel like thin layer concrete sitting bottom ever since ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô. It‚Äôs worst I‚Äôm laying back. it, actual thing. Blah blah blah blah. Stupid stupid does. vaccines nearly effective unless enough ppl herd immunity kick in. since many people opposed even wearing masks vaccinating measles, I'm sure lining coronavirus vaccine given opportunity. people despite wide knowledge prior cases people permits revoked breaching lockdown rules. means either thought rules care despite precedent. Either way, sympathy them. People use phony excuse scum. Hard lawyer permanently disabled coronavirus. go. fact, file injunction delay exam hold exams everyone based safety. legit cause action. Demand everyone tested 12 hours ahead time quarantined test administered. See deal stipulation. plans seem starting travel bubbles ""safe"" countries, combined focusing big spenders resort holidays stuck inside resort time. Ie getting money big companies support government. government seem care smaller tourism businesses gone bust due this. support lot rely charity feed themselves.

They also trying encourage internal tourism many people lost livelihoods, plus able afford even hadn't, seems big ask!

Selfishly like covid barely worry anymore, also selfishly started husband going open tourism business that's gone heck. wait see!  40 percent country would flat refuse follow order completely honest - know people agree - symptomatic danger others around yet refuse quarantine/isolate means I‚Äôd bloody drag van too. It‚Äôs selfish irresponsible China USA. good friend went COVID mild symptoms last longer expected. still recovered fully, CFS, lower lungs capacity, even slight fever occasionally small inflammations body like tendinitis sinusitis. number people wirh long lasting symptoms issues huge, still focus since health care providers still cope pandemics. far know, whatsapp FB groups cover this. sure kind subreddit people meet &amp; share, probably not? Anyways, doctors started grasp condition seriously started build centers people's condirions could tracked closely followed (at least Spain). Congratulations. online?? Aaaaannnd someone going shout ""Lock up!""

Sigh, why, world, why? Shout good ol' US A

""We're #1! We're #1!""

üôÑ guess obvious nobody else felt need point out. enquire regards public health measures, aren‚Äôt Americans responding well compared countries world adopt measures (i.e. mask, testing, contact tracing isolating) clearly least one wearing mask. Yeah, Cuomo desperate sending nursing homes old people terrible idea. realize hindsight 20/20 2020 but... better ideas hard come by. Double-book 2/3 nursing homes old people, designate third COVID patients. Done. 

I'll never forget video nurse worked 3rd 12 hour shift toilet paper lost parking lot. human take much. Well said. husband moderate case mid-March got mild. We're full workouts like before. say people long-term effects, us, now, appear lasting damage. Germany contact tracing app works similar Australian one, using Bluetooth. data stored decentralised phones users. user ID stored frequently newly generated phone IDs. Chaos Computer Club, basically NGO fights data protection internet usually highly critically government, find fault it. software open source viewed anyone.

There technical solutions give government access data. eating rare infected animals dangerous, impact epidemic? feel force America's ""justice"" system making illegal poor homeless. whole washington state cases day Ah ok. Thank clarification, I'm sorry through. Hopefully getting lockdown alright still able get exercise trust? anything China said factually incorrect? I'm living Thailand i'm another country. important thing prevented spread people mostly wore mask protection air pollution even fashion, news COVID19 suddenly everyone started wearing mask everywhere, respect lot others think. Literally go anywhere without wearing mask cause looked like criminal. matter wanting virus Americans. option choice long since gone. matter rather if. live aftermath wearing masks like civilized countries did.  always thought China what‚Äôs left soviet bloc no? part Canada, malls busy today people restaurants like covid, it‚Äôs definitely gone yet it‚Äôs point numbers stable check week, check, check ""good news"" flair posts first... They're protecting citizens, they're protecting economy best save face rest world watching. 'inofficial' videos floating around Chinese citizens dragged unmarked vans kicked screaming. posted videos online disappeared. would ever take 'official' chinese propaganda video face value. Also constant 60 degrees lot steel around. blame companies much unless shutdown much do.

I give credit workers show Americans deserve credit us still get meat Hold fast, friend!

Do **not** let peer pressure get you. annoying take precautions becomes doubly nobody else around it, over, able look back head held high say ""It difficult, everything possibly could keep family safe time crisis.""

I believe you. pretty useless considering US contain what's already there. Covid-19 spreading like wildfire US. Fauci admitted lying. I'm wondering, feel I'm curious guy from. I've thinking starting travel within Spain, saying true, I'm feeling great plan. brain Coronavirus = 100 - n% 
Your brain Alzheimer's = 100 - x% 
Your brain Alzheimer's Coronavirus = 100 - (x + n)% would hard answer question posed. one Publix 80-90% wearing mask, stores less 10%.

I would also say may accurate majority worn mask least past month.

Bad questions lead useless results. want say here, could never worked elsewhere...

But lot akin Vietnam contain it, they're high density, massive population, share border China.

And that's, aggressive regional lockdowns. allowing movement infected areas non-infected. Quarantines everyone exempted. Heavy contact tracing.

[Shit Could worked West responded quickly South East Asia did.

_That said_, could easily drawn short straw, Italy did. comparatively slow also, large element luck gave us outcome (although fortunately, capitalise it).

Once delayed much, understand temptation ""can live it"". Alternatives may seem realistic.

That said, particularly early days, idea every country run ""let's eradicate, fail, pivot flattened curve"". they've slow move, ramp measures slamming brakes, seems total ass-backwards way going it. I'm going pretend know viruses flus work, shit somehow mutates form birdflu we're fucked. meat factories seem like perfect breeding ground disaster keeps getting better better Genius call names, said plan made sense. yes, happened. That's PPP loans supposed for. federal government needed step provide either loans direct cash payments businesses, people would stay home, virus cases dealt with. rocket science. countries survived spike something like that. Instead told people ""fuck off, either get back work(and catch covid) starve"". look us handful anecdotes, proof. Reddit going denounce claims scientifically studied also promoting claims scientifically studied, seems little hypocritical me. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something. italy left chat go buddy... Italy broke though. Someone another thread said get antibody test $10 LabCorp (if USA one near you), they're actually correct! looks like LabCorp contracted group rubber-stamps ""medical necessity"" needed insurance reimburse test. group gets $10, LabCorp gets insurance reimbursement, get antibody test. Way work system favor, LabCorp! Sweden country lot medical experts. saying deferring him? case also agree position? 1/3 people go back ot normal physical/cognitive function long term ICU stays

White folks, please stop calling cops. first time weeks past week. course numbers increasing, city opening back up. doesn‚Äôt negate fact Illinois one states actually met opening requirements. Bonefire85 asked Chicago‚Äôs numbers gone and, factually, have, much larger percentage almost city country. Preface: I'm European, take BLM protests.

To sounds silly.

If go bars restaurants reopen, going help spread virus.

If go protests people super close, sweating screaming, going help spread virus well.

Since open, risk less, risk nonetheless.

Why one good one bad? stupid. basically waste efforts lockdown.

Tbh, one part guilty politicizing this, much true, see reports like these, side also good job thing. Damn dude that's brutal. least made still life, even used be. Asperger's mental problems make difficult function society have. I'm also scared getting thing getting worse. nice thought anyone. Stay safe brother. Hopefully avoid thing completely.

It seems like people arent honest surveys. Depends Trump pushes Look liver profiles live upstate NY probably 90% there. We're phase 4 reopening people getting overconfident. work retail people coming without them. expect new case counts skyrocket soon. _cries Mississippi_ don‚Äôt disagree. think wiped chunk vulnerable population early (before knew anything it, lot ppl got vulnerable died; small case count high dead probability back led high death rate appearance. think end still see consider significant death rate, nowhere near thought be. Also take consideration cure, doctors scientists learning everyday treat people infected virus also saving lives. Re-open rotesters Michigan actually saying higher power would protect them. Amazing. know one true religion pagan gods smite eternity? Yup, same. Church never gone one availability. even think people front church volunteers, probably were. could definitely tell group wearing masks ""courtesy""/requirement wanted too. I‚Äôm sorry. must goofed. Well, must ""some time"" them. That‚Äôs BS. numbers paint consistent picture improving situation due long-term massively slowed spread virus thanks harsh, serious lockdown. There‚Äôs also numbers individual region, showing different situations, though number active cases trending everywhere. numbers lie would massive conspiracy altering various kinds statistics (hospitalised, dead, active cases, infected etc.) 20 regions months.

Furthermore, countries also rely tourism, yet numbers don‚Äôt show thing; instance, Spain increasing active cases. Wouldn‚Äôt greater incentive falsify statistics? Also, foreign tourists far important source income Italy, though course give contribution; priority local business go back normal levels activity, also thanks domestic tourism, maintaining public health safety. enticing foreigners visit top priority, certainly wouldn‚Äôt justify falsifying numbers. read heard interesting idea left right look freedoms. Basically, left wants freedom *from*, right wants freedom *to*. say, right would like freedom *to* discriminate, freedom *to* guns, freedom *to* pollute without repercussion, freedom *to* say want say without negative consequence, etc. left would like freedom *from* poverty homelessness, freedom *from* fear, freedom *from* hate, etc. little sub

You proven assertion. Tomorrow I'm actually expecting lower since they'll reporting Sunday results Jeez 8500 Sunday? combination DeSantis, Trump Pence. Wow, means lot people it. death rate must pretty low then. scientists agree works lockdowns, social distancing masks.

Citations, please? don‚Äôt fly often indiscriminately booked airlines flights I‚Äôve gone delta consistently cleaner, charging ports, WiFi access, snacks offered throughout flight. Also, trays larger airline trays IIRC. yeah, said controversial truth. I'm afraid admit it. Fuhk mah gran-paw! luuHHHUuuVVuh FRREEEEE-DUMBS! Yeehaw! talking about? He‚Äôs making Florida great again. /s controversial everywhere, US seems confused view rights versus responsibilty UK least masks issue. dont hear countries divided view US appears have, least reported here. assume thar majority Americans sensible, socially responsible people.

It‚Äôs likely not, isn‚Äôt even talking point stage. dozens dozens vaccines multiple stages testing, months. Expert consensus one. real question. cure common cold.

Nobody said was, We‚Äôve never needed cure it, it‚Äôs widely deadly cold medicine. Treatment. common cold mutation many different viruses strain requires different vaccine.

You‚Äôre half right. common cold many different viruses, independent mutations don‚Äôt affect much. **Each stain doesn‚Äôt require different vaccine, objectively wrong, especially comes sars-cov-2 stain shares spike protein shape guarantee vaccine one strain covid effective strains.

ONLY spike protein mutates.

We sick back dec/Jan. Wife lung crap months. Super low pulse ox talking doctor. said x-rays normal.

Anyway, 6 months later, blowing old guy numbers thing. can't make red zone gauge. He's hoping everyone better Sweden gets dragged level worse. Swedish mentality applied internationally. Hahaha Outdoor it‚Äôs every person I‚Äôd say. people really avoid street, leaving plenty room distance. Outside different beast indoors. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs evidence outdoors viral transfer cases, points impossible, rare enough difficult document. beach packed people keep distance, hot / sunny / humid weather less ideal viral transfer. Anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers : way I'm taking shit, knows long term side effects?

Anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers : eh, covid big deal, flu! We're gonna get it! (Ignores possible long term possible side effects).

Damned do, damned don't. people stupid. Well, ‚Äúproof‚Äù heart muscle damaged blood work, studies say degree, percentage patients. Likewise know patients emerging Type 1 diabetics, don‚Äôt know mechanism.
 say proof, hasn‚Äôt really solidified seems dogmatic me. ?? Dude first comment weirdly worded tho. said ""wait til tomorrow's numbers"".

They report day first post implies. True, hope level immunity, stupidity wild card there, die sth else. even 1% goes directly person person, infection result. viral load billions thereabouts.

Yes obviously. 97% infections person person contact 3% air ducts, lower infections 3% filtering air ducts.

Those 3% might cases worth trouble. Together methods. like ""3% reduction useless."" Depending situation, might be.

It would maybe make sense submarine air carrier maybe nuclear plant. places, want get % reduction could protraying - two people sitting next present much smaller distance virus travel distance person filter. en route filter, virii certain enter people. viral load per breath likely billions.

This like third time repeat me, wrote first post. repeated times lol. It‚Äôs wrong feel irrelevant. too. I‚Äôm chef. let tell you, it‚Äôs shit. Conditions, people, heat, sheer amount customers. Barely masks, someone tests positive Covid, we‚Äôll probably all, already then. 

Now we‚Äôre getting indoor open, still seating outside. overwhelming 15th opened outside. It‚Äôs going overwhelming 2nd. Let alone 4th fucking July. [Tyson colluded meat companies manufacture artificial shortage fix prices order justify keeping plants operating recorded record profit. IP address unreachable ... Can't read...  

Ethanol, typically used hand sanitizer unsafe... ingredients much... course, much ethanol safe normal. think plenty people groups ignoring social distancing recommendations, think millennials  ignoring guidelines group probably far less most. early 30s take much precaution really go groceries always wear mask outside home. consider lucky able work home too. building opened amenities asked residents follow rules include wearing masks, guests, max limit persons. outdoor area grills furniture every evening month filled people ignoring rules. Management seems burried heads sand refuses comment intend enforce rules us want safely use space feel comfortable so. I've asked comp rent anything. Maybe illicit response, think louder group people complaining can't people parties. 4th July probably going get lot people infected here. point you‚Äôre making excuses. Nobody honestly believes protests didn‚Äôt impact spike coincidentally happened 2 weeks later. fact people like you‚Äôs first response ‚Äúmost people wore masks‚Äù literally google manor BLM protest big city see huge amounts people, sometimes majority, without masks.

Lying making excuses undermines everything health professionals saying.

If hundreds thousands people standing shoulder shoulder yelling impact spread despite social distancing guidelines, would anyone listen them? vaccine save half population stupid get :) Ditto Washington. Except Korean grocery go to, almost never see people masks. certainly better data hospitalized cases low grade asymptomatic infections, hopefully we're 6-month mark, studies garden-variety infection cycles. Lol dumbass Yield 12-25% Same. Upstate NY top mask wearing social distancing. always idiots, everyone else using ‚Äúan abundance caution‚Äù, town finally zero cases. think small percentage getting attention would go place filters air ducts, I'd worry getting infected person person contact.

And yeah, hand shake! saying probability getting sick things outside vanishingly low.

Given known health benefits spending time outside, low risk, almost certainly net health benefit.

Not attending Trump rally. want, though. Logical. July 4th going disaster part?

My director engineering religious preacher. Critical thinking prerequisite engineer. also spends majority free time helping people church volunteering community. wonder much controversy first time people wear pants first time. think that‚Äôs true. One startling datapoint recently saw UK hospitalization death rate gone 24% start pandemic 2% now.

If sources, kind evidence welcoming then? Thoughts prayers? Hopes dreams? guy seems interested reputation justifying actions actually controlling pandemic. needs take step back, check ego, look works successful countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea. Mandatory masks, closing high risk activities, distancing, waiting number new cases reaches low level seems work. Sweden's loose recommendations keep everything open work well numbers prove it. needs stop talking press start learning. country divided citizens cannot even unite combat pandemic that‚Äôs sign failing state right Similar experience last week. Flew MKE think 1/3 people masks. PHX saw maybe 2 people without masks on. would honestly expect backwards.

Whether asleep fully woke

They understand viruses

Are going kill folks

So you, infected across land

There's need argue

People understand would unusual viral infection trigger type 1 diabetes patients. people predisposed type 1 diabetes normally trigger it. people predisposed type 1 diabetes develop disease. governors fault risk people don‚Äôt protect virus? Thats lot cases Sunday Fuck sucks :( sorry that. smoker past too, years pains... **best case** data half report wearing mask half time.

Which also stated ""more 1/4 regularly wear mask store."" best.  either candidate? never claimed correlation. lot Americans racist. Oodles admit it. Masks something Asian people wear virus came there's way going something Asians do. wondering think Trump competent leader nation extremely dangerous viral threat managed serious intent. Given present real world circumstances, time around, think *is* right wrong way vote. worst odds. Still takes one. curve flattened, open 'er saying don‚Äôt trust government, don‚Äôt to. vaccines put phase 3 trials like vaccine would many thousands people results published. able read side effect profile weigh risks benefits yourself.

Personally side effects would REALLY bad dangerous get vaccine part end pandemic way get flu shot part keeping flu season control. serious dangerous side effects vaccine likely won‚Äôt approved. many candidates pipeline people mass produce unsafe one. happens one city people spout talk spikes happening. Houston protests, houston spiked. LA protests, LA spiked. NEW YORK?!? 

Yea....  undies. Got let em breathe!!! pandemic, I've rural central PA. 

In OR, I'd say less 10% people wear masks. those, maybe 50% wearing correctly. 

In PA, get stores without I'm seeing friends hangout party.

Both situations ticking time bombs..... would ban Americans too. It‚Äôs public health. handling virus like idiots. Nothing unique, sadly. Ukraine tendency although initial harsh lockdown curbed spread well, gain fast track lost completely. Hi 10 people discussion relative handling outcome crisis Italy vs US. 

My statement less 2x reported difference strong evidence countries responses actually different talking exponential growth.

Your response ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt care 62K fewer deaths‚Äù.  Humanity unsalvagable. no? shouldn‚Äôt put sick people people sick. It‚Äôs really hard understand. governor hee haw gonna kill us see author? entire existence based turning bond eye reality truth Good. Im glad they've finally managed make good decision. Except lockdown countries lockdown small bit entire time we've dealing corona.

Tegnell seems stuck March open others closed. 

Now almost July, everybody open months. Sweden open anybody else.

Saying ones social distancing dumb. 

It's like burger chain arguing special trick ketchup. Yeah, considering many governors won‚Äôt mandate masks number Americans whining wearing masks, America past. awww think give shit sad little white supremacist? Haha. mean ‚Äúhalf-assed‚Äù something. Closing bars? Ratcheting back occupancy limits don‚Äôt actually cause restaurants limit patrons? Allowing counties continue lie case rates stay higher limits (source: Parker County)?

It‚Äôs window dressing. won‚Äôt help. know else started ‚ÄúT‚Äù? Titanic. Florida half-assed lockdown, mask wearing widespread, thousand uncontrolled active cases?! nothing Italian situation, get bring up. Florida business usual day. 9000 news cases within hour Desantis shut bars across state. 

But apparently telling people wear mask bridge far. Wtf? That‚Äôs going fucking bellend. 

Teachers aren‚Äôt paid potentially life threatening situations easily managed otherwise. 

Teachers nit selfish. protecting children.

(the fridge decontamination drawer well stuff cant left long). Takeout food...i cant really with. sure that‚Äôs proper understanding argument, though? asked someone ‚Äúwhy wear masks‚Äù response, would response ‚ÄúI believe conspiracy theories zero science‚Äù? lived America 8 years. US pros cons, like country. met many smart freethinking people time there. absolutely right: many things like US. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* I'm worried about, honestly vaccine ""not safe"" - sensationalist news reports come low percentage adverse reactions it. Like said, happens people every vaccine. almost certainly going happen one, too. 

Problem is, even want media blackout bad reactions. reported on. issue reporting reactions framed people receive it, seems basically uncontrollable point. 7% must live area many people walking around mask even though we're spiking BADLY. Nice. spent 10 days hospital starting June 19th gave test spot even letting get ambulance head hospital, able give results immediately well. 

It uncomfortable AF glad see people/places area putting strict protocols like place. Yeah, hand sanitizer made Mexico methanol it.

Really need pull shit market people wind dead. Yeah, too, I'm safe &amp; I'm taking anything home I've stopped caring. think we're going see 10,000 nothing huge.

But hospital said weekend worst weekend. ... already!?! I‚Äôm third world country true. I‚Äôve written people don‚Äôt wear masks regular assholes don‚Äôt give f anyone. political issue. Honestly feel issue people wearing masks wrong pulling constantly whatever. hospitalizations decreasing (MN) Exactly I‚Äôve mostly going drive thrus silly wear mask. think entire city ecosystem. city sustained protests central business district, restaurants, bars, etc. closed; roads blocked; public transit interruptions; there's threat violence; curfews, etc. report points out, cities like net isolation distancing. exact opposite set circumstances cities made decision reopen business. American political parties reason. Increase it‚Äôs likely matter.

You proven assertion. Username checks out. don‚Äôt think virus cares restaurant taking subway go protest people getting sick? could possibly be? ...I'm always afraid post articles, impossible mention politics point. mean obvious reason happens , nation denies germ theory vs nation pandemic... yea... Anyone know underlying technology used produce this? mean, share video doctor saying something crazy like masks don‚Äôt work, Reddit would demonize it. thought standard ‚Äúpeer reviewed studies‚Äù. Apparently they're going try develop inhaled version remdesivir. Hopefully makes easier administer process? want donate, others said didn‚Äôt feel like Red Cross took enough safety precautions even scientists rushing this. go ahead try first one out. dont like (sweden) dealing corona, domt blame swedes going country country allows could tell horrified idea going inside played ""I gamble""

""I gamble... life."" China perfectly democratic. happens everyone chooses support CCP. choosing CCP leads better outcome going CCP. try hard? see many threads saying thing. That‚Äôs literally strikes work. 

They forgo pay accept returning work want link bevy studies showing vitamin deficiency poor Covid 19 outcomes? Studies viral load factor disease severity?

My statement reflection likelihood environmental driver belief ""the virus weakening"". viewpoint spread many believe likely. would welcome evidence contrary. Bullshit. Every time go store, see ratio 1:20 wearing mask. Boise, Idaho. Someone tell Florida vertical line flattened means. leading increased use public transportation might bigger risk. CTA often close capacity restaurants still closed. Business usual can‚Äôt happen city without crowded mass transit. Tough situation. aren‚Äôt vaccines modified SARS vaccines works years now? Well....yes working.

There‚Äôs little evolutionary pressure mutate quickly even proof reading sequence reduce mutation errors. 

TLDR. Increase it‚Äôs likely matter. rate, nothing changes, likely months. We‚Äôre precipice next flu season plus active time hurricane season, school returning. Right now, none factoring American cases rising. It‚Äôs going unfortunate (unless things done, like nothing done, it‚Äôs reason). Also, pandemic benefits unemployed expiring next month well.

If you‚Äôre offended asked sources claims, stop making them.

A quick glance sources looks like pre-prints peer reviewed. Meaning, calling research evidence links uncovered. third one even conflict interest statement author, publishing benefits Vitamin supplements, receives funding Bio-Tech Pharmacal, sells Vitamin supplements. That‚Äôs big conflict interest, opinion.

Still, good sources overall, reviewed. I‚Äôm curious though, seem say vitamin supplementation reduce *risk* infection death - infected already? risk factors like obesity, diabetes, etc. affect large portions American populace? far appears seen positive evidence related Vitamin D, [we cannot make definitive claims yet think part research process, peer reviews important. It‚Äôs long, arduous, resource intensive. biggest thing (I think) overwhelming health system. might worried getting it, hospitals transform wards ICU areas COVID patients. Therefore, maybe someone comes heart attack, needs stitches, anything, hospital might turn away literally don‚Äôt room anyone except COVID patients (if there‚Äôs even room left). It‚Äôs also kind selfish say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care people get it‚Äù promise they‚Äôll care family member gets it, gets put hospital, can‚Äôt see due hospitals allowing visitors. Whoa. still March? Stay away U.P. then. I'd say mask usage actually increased local grocery store past couple weeks 85-90%. 

Just 988 tests Marquette county day. 4 came back positive. .04% rate.

Yooper Strong! Whether understudied seems kind moot intention lie? information would made difference given intention lie case. truly absurd defence offer.

That's pretty sad. viruses kill immunity. That's fact life. introduce stringent supression measures time 'flatten curve' prevent hospitals over-run, suppression strategies succeed delaying outbreak, long control measures sustained. controls eased restricted, epidemic likely continue.

If said every country beginning two choices;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Shutdown, close 'non-essential' businesses, make millions unemployed, destroy economy, close education, force people stay indoors 12-16 weeks, close everything including vital hospital procedures, or:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Deal fact - vast majority population would unnafected Covid - approx 500-800 people every million die, would end stages lives. *And, btw, probably without health services collapsing.*

.. one country planet - *at least -* would looked Option 2 serious strategy. one.

The Swedish strategy currently vilified media suit Covid-1984 narrative.

The Swedish strategy currently vilified countries justify dranconican destructive unproven measures introduced.

How many times need read articles like , 18 customers 7 staff got Texas bar realize bars social situations design (i.e. grouping, interacting, talking loudly music) inherently dangerous.

**These headlines getting redundant ""Florida/Texas set new daily case records). obvious Covid barhopper.** Honestly, yeah.

The liver great example would play out.

Any time organ injured new cell growth needed, increase risk growth become malignant. time, 0.01%.

But alcoholics higher rates liver cancer continue cause trauma liver again.

Any organs limited ability remodel organs injured virus might see increased cancer risk.

I thought check out. Stories like break heart. never come this. I'm sorry denied care bc poorly handled pandemic state.  restaurants became dine in, initial hording waves slowed(yes, slowed enough get essentials), fine. could find food, might exactly might've wanted, could get it. Restaurants still take out. Dine creates chances spread. would need covid infusion centers. Normal infusion places sick people getting infusions cancer, chrons, etc. even asking question?

Often people reddit disingenuous argue bad faith. particular instance appears yeah ethnic families lot high touch white families. read news? 
  
  see indoor service issue. bar requires masks, allowed take eating drinking obviously. Gee, bar? DRINK. People going quickly tire mask off...drink...mask on......mask off....drink....mask on...

It sucks bar owners, answers make money stay business, outdoor serving might max allowed. single mask picture? Dunno, choosing back forth non sequitur strawman? I‚Äôm implying that, saying careful dealing national data. second third time observed hospitals. see become common problem need reevaluate things virus affects young people. bars open, people going go, that's short end it. gonna pay bar owner employees stay home, else supposed do?

The government puts people situations expects magically find way it. stats numbers, they're *people*. People families friends lives living.

Don't dick. people stay home never leave. hard. Turn air nozzle shower fresh filtered air severely limits amount second hand air breathe contaminated around you. wear food comes server walked away. One two things happen. 

Some people say screw take chance crippled. 

Others wear full body face suits air filters. 

People want mix mingle can't stay inside forever.  Canada closed Northern border, closed Southern border Europe closed borders you.

Was aim along? LOL vaccine coming 2021. Come now. Yes, somewhat plan stated that. I‚Äôm glad bars restaurants showing dangerous places currently. It‚Äôs everyone forgot studies done China (meaning we‚Äôve known months) show AC vents commonly used surfaces like door knobs toilets spreaders. top that, mask issue kids means I‚Äôm walking building everyday lot kids either won‚Äôt wear them, won‚Äôt wear properly even enforce them. It‚Äôs office adults social distance wear masks (still risk) medical office everyone extremely careful. 

I‚Äôm basically ready refinance house blow savings year quit, sucks loved job this. hope hospitals overwhelmed, decide go full remote keep job health awhile. antibody test, go results within 24 hours super pleased quick turnaround. Even states long, phased reopenings seeing upticks again. political agenda everyone already knows. rest life. blame media responses like this. Well it‚Äôs bar, sooooooo. Masks can‚Äôt warned 100-% time eating drinking. Restaurants bars shouldn‚Äôt open right now. many times say it? Someone going telling truth! sources this? Rogan called CDC‚Äôs nonsense regarding masks question (with flipping back forth) someone listens episodes reporters, commentators, scientists, he‚Äôs ever support mask wearing AFAIK wear public. pretty clear was
him trying get rise Burr.  Yea guess work restaurant bunch cheap o‚Äôs work certainly . Well guess could never bad thing someone wants tip MAGA wants send everyone back 1950's America.. fucking moron's today believe modern vaccines cause Autism.. None going talk Polio none deal pressed imagine would say something along lines. America great deep state began controlling government. 
[Yes, Idaho checking in. seems half half, unmasked people meanmug masked ones (and probably vise versa can't tell)  I'm dual citizen EU passport date. wonder would allowed fly American passport. I'd also flying outside US, that's another question altogether! shit show turning be. testing impossible nobody else either"". 

And simply bullshit.

In June, city Wuhan tested 10 million people. Found 300 cases.  took 19 days. 


Mass testing *is* possible, *NOT* it. 

And reason technology, political so. think intrusion civil liberties, God given right cough death upon anyone around me, whether like not. 

Here highly reputable western-government funded, no-axe-to-grind-against-the-president media source. Google find hundreds more. Also Italy Spain. think point places like Germany you‚Äôre going see relatively common outbreaks forcing repeated shutdowns. Swedish approach acknowledges it‚Äôs unlikely vaccine available early next year, may never available, population can‚Äôt sustain level health measures required stop outbreaks. think Sweden still partially shutdown, need recognize schools need remain open businesses must operate may NEVER vaccine indefinite containment feasible. cousin works hospital NYC. hospital became overwhelmed, helping intubate people. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST. 10% staff sick COVID nobody else around it. horrible constantly worried wrong accidentally killing someone. Again, I‚Äôm sorry hear that‚Äôs conclusion. encourage seek civil discussions disagree with, instead citing videos put together already agree you. 

We need understanding less villainizing side. I‚Äôm sure least agree. So, thinking _might not_ appropriate comparison. recall months ago NY still strict testing criteria. Patients clear symptoms COVID get tested. Doctors fighting behalf patients unless met strict criteria sent home _probable covid_ asked isolate. mountain people covid counted official numbers. 

Currently, Arizona completely different. Even asymptomatic individuals tested. number positive individuals better reflection overall number people actually COVID.

I'm saying AZ crisis needs addressed immediately. _clearly_ is. I'm sure expect another NY even wait 2 weeks take action. think? true, born big city best hospitals world. know this, worry virus middle part country rural areas great country, going ok? think something Americans retarded. first link

""The findings systematic review 172 studies (44 comparative studies; n=25‚Äà697 patients) COVID-19, SARS, MERS provide best available evidence current policies least 1 physical distancing associated large reduction infection, distances 2 might effective. data also suggest wearing face masks protects people (both health-care workers general public) infection coronaviruses, eye protection could confer additional benefit. However, none interventions afforded complete protection infection, optimum role might need risk assessment several contextual considerations.¬†""

So, social distancing better masks eye protection

From second link:

"" said combining widespread mask use social distancing lockdown measures, could ‚Äúan acceptable way managing pandemic re-opening economic activity‚Äù development effective vaccine COVID-19, respiratory illness caused coronavirus. ""

So masks work combination social distancing lockdown measures. Nothing masks alone work. 


The 3rd link interesting since looks infection trends mandatory use masks implemented different areas. show mask mandatory, trend dropped. made believe masks reason. 
Meanwhile trend gone even though mandatory use masks removed. disproveves conclusion using arguments used study. 

You try harder find science claiming masks effective way stop virus American, care Americans give fuck? There's way accurate. accounting improper usage people still think compliance. go see lot people ""wearing"" face masks half covering noses.

This also ignoring ""some"" even ""most"" time good enough. mutate existence, deep shit

Yeah, folks waiting might well sign death certificates. Notice hear anything ""herd immunity"" anymore either. question blind faith humanity brilliantly beaten yet. saying countries + Western Australia cases now. they're going flout safety? What? can't stay afloat pushing safety close back down. everyone's business going survive. Sadly countries safety nets built corporations small businesses people.

The Restaurant video gets pass I've informed last time owners called cops fucking arrested Owners guy causing problems. reading airborne HIV conspiracy nut stuff months ago, never actually believed we'd seeing parallels made mainstream. wow. Absolutely. like never-ending pattern, countries open seems cases start increasing again, happen, lockdown again?

I know half million people lot China, keep keep damage continuous, helps containing spread hurt economies citizens long term.

Again, I'm saying wrong it, see victory agree with. welcome Bill Gates/George Soros New World Order. We'll coming soon. Lacking jackboots now. summed NYT Op Ed page single sentence. countries get again

Taking care patients much manageable taking care hundred thousands patients though. nations handled pandemic like Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand focus healthcare system taking care sick people. 

Nations like US fucked long-term. easy way now. hope so. Nothing open Chicago inner-Chicago suburbs despite authorities insisting things open. restaurants chosen open cannot make money. trying meet friend lunch tomorrow favorite restaurants still open think time future cannot open anymore without ""effective"" vaccine. get things like street fairs festivals people like Chicago. got bag pretzels around somewhere vaccine last two months good enough? Pure psychotic ,narcissistic Incompetence POTUS...sums . Oh, really?

In case, difference deaths US Italy almost certainly going become smaller time situation US apparently much less controlled Italy. told grade school kid prefer continue online schooling till there's vaccine, especially fall winter. 

The district polling parents. I'm curious results, red county, hardly anyone wearing masks, unless they're Wal-Mart. Yeah sticky memory numbers became pothead. can't remember phone number. kind lunatic would get transatlantic flight anyway? lot depends gets virus. know case New York across US 40% virus deaths occurred nursing homes.

Good day! Ur lunatic. people die flu Exactly. managed ""flatten curve"" simply recording it.

When rate infection first took off, simply stopped testing majority potentially infected people, guaranteeing infection would continue spreading.

When switch bad testing people milder symptoms, rate infection rocketed upwards again.

[Daily ""flattened curve"" always illusion, Tegnell knew it. fact counting it, kept talking ""herd immunity"" weeks away. could happen virus spreading exponential rate. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve learned can‚Äôt conversation family members fundamentally believe underlying data manipulated (undercounted, overcounted, collected improperly, more) fit agenda. collection, believe statistical analysis done incorrectly.

Are saying believe underlying data manipulated, undercounted, overcounted, collected improperly, more? even fit agenda, general?

You sit here, posting reddit, subreddit, think data collected properly counts accurate?

No wonder can't conversation family members. W Science man's gift humanity.

And course, doesnt support initial claim. California hates Trump they've gotten bad too.

Austin Texas bars open hipsters go them.

It's American problem. Liberal Americans also part selfish ""me me"" rugged Individualism. Illinois. number cases gone significantly before, everyone required wear masks public (and area, comply). positivity rate per test also quite low well. stay country bad. leave immediately! Also ordered food &amp; liquor anticipation reopening, debt net loss order... lots factors.
amount testing.
how much sheltering happened when.
sensitivity testing. antibody test tells may also indicate previously exposed.

frankly many factors model accurate.

but know sure viruses shells quickly break sunlight. increasing amount stronger sunlight going lower transmission air else same. Hey... look that, Trump got wall built.

On wrong side, wrong people. right answer. last 40 years, taking sledgehammer pillars society (social safety nets, sense community/solidarity/that together, good paying jobs middle class, responsible media mainly reports facts, etc.).

 Americans age) die unnatural death due long reach old age. assume mean vaccine available market. Luckily happens, one even close first. That‚Äôs clinical trials. 

Phase 1 vaccine trial: usually lower dose, looking safety. believe covid trials Phase 1/2 trial first arm low dose safety study quickly moves increasing dose study look efficacy. 

Phase 3: large efficacy safety study final formulation process used manufacturing. effectively exact vaccine would available commercially approved. many thousands people study. 

Again, restate, vaccine approved THOUSANDS people already vaccine evaluated safety efficacy. even close first person get vaccine even first person receive day approved available. would love see experts exploring this. Gaslighting affects idiots

False. using colloquial definition word ""symptom"", doctors use much specific definition.

A ""symptom"" something patient feels... example headache back pain... can't observed doctor.

A ""sign"" abnormality observed doctor... example rash, lung damage.

An ""asymptomatic"" patient one complain feeling unwell. ""asymptomatic"" patient still showing signs disease. example, can't ""feel"" high blood pressure such, sign heart disease.

In case, people feel different normal scanned found mild lung damage. Hence, ""asymptomatic"" still showing ""signs"" disease.

The uptick cases hit March 18 rising 235 16th 1,342 18th, 3,052 20th. April 4 New York 11,500 new cases per day.

DeSantis ordered return partial lockdown June 25, cases rising since June 4  Trump voted out, President Biden endorses it? Bullshit Yes, healthcare economist interpret data profession. Nowhere data set assertion supported. So, again, please explain.

Hint: older individuals greater risk mortality. data say nothing lasting injury, however. Ha! 1. It‚Äôs old people too. 

2. things called ‚Äúlaws‚Äù control people do. Weeks? might go summer fall wave one big tsunami. LOL, mad? someone tell high IQ? define by? hahaha. bullshit man. Get it.

Driving Iowa Nebraska today confirm 0% masks worn gas stations getting car local license plates. tried back people didn‚Äôt like it. fact, they‚Äôre still taking pretty poorly burning flag, etc. mean genius philanthropist funding advanced vaccine research years literally reason deceive anyone? This! 

Every single person COVID-19 (symptomatic asymptomatic) is, likely, someone catch pass least wave. cannot overstate importance people slowing spread. 

While everyone freaking spread South West right now, would remiss ignore fact states got walloped beginning (NY, NJ, IL, MI) numbers dropping like bricks. Illinois reported 15 deaths today. 

While may herd immunity, think approaching certain level spread may significantly reduce potential second wave. Illinois (my home state) open extent month even massive protests Chicago, numbers rising deaths falling precipitously. Unless mythical angel watching protestors, level herd immunity already play. live Texas virtually everywhere I've doors 90% people wearing masks. believe people wearing masks grocery stores retail spaces.

That said, bars restaurants looks like people wearing masks (hard consuming food beverages) jackasses.

So many people fucking rest believe majority lying say wear masks doors except bars restaurants. Sure, hand schools closed fall people young children need parent stay home watch them. either way economy screwed. need aware good solutions many dilemmas COVID presents us with, sometimes choose best two shitty options. Naw, far know that's one questions instantly disqualifies people. Take look outside Reddit. young people went back lives. Hell...most older people know never stopped lives this. tried purchase home workout equipment last 3 months so? Sold out. Teachers losing hero status, three, two, one.. opinion carries real weight. wife teaches middle school that‚Äôs close this. 

I don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs awful lot demand it. Kids need age need caretaker people need work. there‚Äôs also lot risk. 

What happens outbreak occurs pre-k? will. everyone quarantine parents too. pays that? It‚Äôs nightmare scenario. Hey, might entitled don‚Äôt know means!! town it‚Äôs 5% wear masks. covid never arrived that‚Äôs people act like Springfield MO. üôÑüôÑ wear Karen haircut, lose Karen privileges.  really don‚Äôt get people pack bars restaurants still pandemic going on.

There person YouTube telling story. went bar friends restrictions lifted ""to celebrate things reopening"". 30-40 people bar got COVID.

They defended ""nobody blame legally open"". Like, umm, no? people charge blame let bars open back *to begin with* *also* somewhat blame using common sense. here's kicker... said bartenders wearing safety stuff (masks, gloves, etc) bathroom soap. still stayed.

It's idiocy/ignorance. Fuck life. Seriously- read post. You‚Äôre advocating shooting idiots wearing mask. 

Your country insane you‚Äôve got right bear arms. course decisions made them, course things get spun. negate government message. We've gone quite track here. given current mixed messages government pushing, good night. town it‚Äôs 5% wear masks. covid never arrived that‚Äôs people act like Springfield MO. üôÑüôÑ crazy, even seem like good news. countries particular Asian ones like 95%+ mask compliance.

Also sometimes answer choice -\_\_- record video still ventilator? think someone telling truth...

I'm late 30's accept limitations want see young kids saddled health problems rest lives risk health anyone know. 

Universities/colleges need stop treating coronavirus like flu. ELI5 fucked economy collapse? New York good job. epicenter New York City always going hit hard huge number people packed small area. Thank much. killed them, clearly vulnerable it. governor (Georgia) refuses mandate masks forbids government official mandating them. means mayor county officials can't mandate masks, school officials can't mandate masks kids go back school person. ITT: People eye-balling percentages counter-argument. could argue beaches ok indoor establishment needs closed.

Especially bars. ""guys facts matter theoretically manipulated. Gut feelings hunches really solves problems"" Well even $1 here, like 90 cents, yea touch expensive Canada due higher taxes.

Outdoor transmission incredibly low.

That said rise coming weeks restrictions lifted, that's expected. goes show considered insane also largely determined socially acceptable. Even pretty crazy stuff get socially acceptable. Yeah definitely sucks. bouncers help? would done people walked punched someone face? even, would happen bar serving expired food? would closed allowed let continue.

Until wearing masks actually taken seriously (not saying responsibility, it‚Äôs bar owner/manager‚Äôs responsibility figure out) there‚Äôs chance avoiding kinds encounters.

I don‚Äôt really buy supposed argument way getting people take safety mandate seriously, many laws regulations strictly enforced. Mask wearing not. Ah, yeah. exactly useful comparison given geographical differences.

We drink often saying still fun without going bar. initial spike inevitable getting rid barrier prevented covid-19 spreading public. However, also depends smart people - NY Northeast, people smart majority wears masks socially distance. Due noticeable spike. South, however, reopening fallen early majority refuses follow guidelines. also plays role think 7% kind low. week state voluntary mask use whenever went 25% people wearing masks. mandatory mask use, without penalty. didn‚Äôt use counter example tho. clearly whataboutism. 


Also use Jordan Peterson weirdo. precise speech. Straight dictionary could ou ask find breakdowns sub-country? Worldmeters US breakdowns states (inexplicably all), UK.

Hell, half stores even employees wearing masks. 7% live Florida? üòì NY deaths far state.

However, **every day** wait means hundreds thousands extra deaths heavy economic damage. Furthermore, daily damage trending **up**. 

We act get Coronavirus control. longer wait damage we'll suffer. Cambodia allowing everyone requirements make near impossible coming states. need negative test within last 72 hours $3000 deposit. arrive taken government facility everyone plane gets tested again. anyone tests positive whole plane people quarantined 14 days.

It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous much censor shit. I'm sure I'm places people die. Phoenix, they've declared shutdown Fiesta Mall shutdown St. Luke's hospital emergency covid capacity locations things get really bad. We're 90% ICU capacity currently probably blow surge capacity sometime mid July. I'm assuming that's they'll start staging covid people emergency locations.

Good point! lot places major protests seeing spike. many people went protests, far congregating bars, meeting parties, distancing, wearing masks. Mass protests may incur epidemiological risk even masks testing, clearly prime driver behind current surge we're seeing. Jose testing asymptomatic people

Nice! people sake:

I think two important factors spread: population density exposure time.

San Jose twice population density Houston, live.  San Jose close population-dense cities, Houston not. Houston, can't any. dam. thing. without getting car driving first. 

San Jose got exposed earlier Houston.

AND YET, Houston's county 29,162 cases, Santa Clara 3,984.

It's obvious really proves San Jose things right, us mouth breathers can't understand ICU's getting fuller.

Please thank government officials better mouth breathers. But, demand even better. Taiwan always maintained positivity rate \~0.6%, California swabbed way school

That would awesome. Maybe realistic weekly, yes, that's direction needs go in.

Maybe case, I'll admit testing improvements obviously easiest improvements make. I'd talk phone tracing apps, always gets trouble privacy nuts. Actually, schools tracing easier - class infected student easy find contact. teachers/staff danger, see anything do. I'm favor giving hazard pay year. Full disclosure, wife pre-school teacher (boy, never stops bragging wonderful, non-sneezing angel-children /s).

Anyway, shutting schools 2020 option country. Idk, maybe surprise say San Jose solved problems schools ready technology, material, training, parents somehow able take care kids lose jobs. even that's true, can't get Texas same, thing what's good non-rich hard. 9 10 Asian parents disagree. 

My teenage years would fun dad. learn nothing ny? Hospitals need get set export patients. area ICU getting close surge capacity week aggressively went ICU census identified people could transport. critical could travel went big hospital center room stable ones ICU yet risk, shipped 1-2hrs away hospital area largely unaffected. According GF works move saved hospital, well expanded ICU capacity able clear like 1/3 ICU dramatically slowed influx floor units. 

Now hospital 1-2hrs away starting ramp came staff asked help/advice setting staffing surge COVID ICU start getting overrun they'll sending patients back way. Obviously works cities get hit once. 

Maybe Houston/San Antonio/Austin triangle could get something together. send vented patients 3hrs Houston two maybe keep floor units open slow influx ICU floor admits. austin-SA could good relationship. linking log-scale cumulative graph saying see decline? even understand cumulative graphs work? log-scale cumulative graph, linear decline, steady, linear growth showing similar slightly bent curves. picked number one *worst possible* way showing trend I'm talking about, makes either dishonest dumb.

Seriously, I've read Famous Five 30 years, understanding flashing lights across moor works nostalgic. issues way pre-date virus. huge increase cases slowed testing time. limit swabs ingredients assay. states start taking seriously August, September complete wash. takes 6-8 weeks lockdown full recovery.

NY unacceptable apocalypse. referring apocalyptic levels hospitalizations, myself. 1/3 population infected needed hospitalizations could hundreds thousands. think could set hasty ICUs thousand people easier could attend 100,000 week, im swagging... 

The state intervene next 30 days regardless. to. That's keeping death-count down. someone dies ""pneumonia"", counted ""COVID"" death, even pneumonia actually caused sars-cov-19 virus. eh, long site... higher, know ;) makes sense. car making funny noise, call congresscritter, go mechanic. roof leaking, call roofing company, mayor. someone would trust politician doctor scientist something related disease beyond comprehension. worried move across country school month. 

I‚Äôm currently coming Covid traveling plan, planning every single gas station go to. sharpest tool shed considering one unable pay 12 bucks supporting journalism pay kombucha bread machines? vaccinated people show re-infection inside year, could induce mass panic.

That's really gets shit. Supposedly Phase 3 starts August, they're supposed read October. That's like month two observation, tops. way meant evaluate efficacy vaccine? Snowpiercer 2: Electric Flugaloo. nearly enough account numbers dropping much. 800 ppl day dying percentage infected actually quite low. Thank sharing article, twas riveting read. sarcastic here, really enjoyed it.

I idea Spanish flu could conceivably American! People...the cause solution life‚Äôs prob...wait that‚Äôs alcohol.

You great thunberg Germans tell can‚Äôt do. funny Cuomo historically bad governor meme-like civic persona wildly popular. Rally round flag indeed. 
 
On side coin 6% tragically normal lot jurisdictions. CoVid wreaked havoc nursing homes earlier centers virus even worse. fucking impractical 

In restaurants, bars, planes even schools, need remove mask often/not one all. can‚Äôt eat drink on. sweat much on. Trump tomorrow, ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. TOLD COULD IT!"" I'm concerned here, Philadelphia, people generally seem taking seriously (although South Philadelphia I've heard otherwise) we've extended gradual phasing day day life. I'm concerned Lancaster Allehgeny counties opened quickly level compliance. think maybe even week two yellow would effective approach. spreading truth know serious, we're going die rate. younger kids get going live side effects lot longer though. ya know - people wear fucking mask separate, yet semi related topic -- believe process people certain age (80?) possess faculties (or part Living people still) apply humane voluntary euthanasia.

I've seen inside plenty nursing homes pretty. 96 year old Grandma pretty poor physically health, saying wants die least 12 years now. Almost everyone ever known loved dead, mentally last year, really much all. 1 meter? thought recommended 2 meters Made number. 250K - 500K annually. don‚Äôt drive it‚Äôs issue doubt would since it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot real thing‚Äù according doctors. I‚Äôm killing anyone road. true though. Atleast netherlands. small 6 person office (i room), coworker drive Florida NJ due family emergency last Monday.

Now see news visitors quarantine 14 days, think enforce it? come back work safe room him? wears mask every time goes FYI Let‚Äôs real. People hard time following arrows grocery stores. plenty reasons beyond blatant disregard safety. 

Add alcohol scenario rules go window. 

Realistically people don‚Äôt want take risk getting sick still going bars unrealistic. r/noahgettheboat story couple weeks ago outside transmission 20x less likely inside transmission. got buried news, unfortunately. Hey dont harsh them. Finally found guts close theme parks /s ""handle plague"" lol Imagine believing true. handled shit. One woman? Source? You‚Äôre right, selfish. apologies.

thats keep sued. know did. Reminds Kevin Bacon 'Animal House' - ""Remain calm.  governor makes absolutely effort even ask young people wear masks, one surprised don't.

An executive order masks ""required"", would long way toward convincing people wear them.  explanation required, would also help. tell something, explain important, people cooperate.

By making absolutely effort control virus, governor DeSantis heading toward total shutdown. young people give virus older co-workers (e.g., boss, owner), company shut location.

You cannot order companies open. cannot order customers show up, spend. PANICKING? PANICKING?

\- DeSantis HIV takes months become detectable blood tests. *record scratch*. Yep, that‚Äôs bleak. nice one getting inflammatory mate, really shows got lot backing up. noticed chose ignore article linked outlining long term effects virus get absolutely let run rampant. trump stays another 4 years, I'll lost hope guys. would rather bum-fuck new zealand 'land free' deeply divided literally every important issue. I‚Äôd like go fund put pool backyard pretend I‚Äôm vacation. going post numbers like that, provide source. need see source percentage confirmed much much lower estimated asymptomatic 1 every 2 confirmed. think establish June 14 President Obama Appreciation Day. day think give political credit President Obama many problems blow true crises. Thank taking necessary measures early on. time appreciate great were.  many children 10 even got Covid? many died? preproduction would alleviate many capacity concerns, least domestically (and lets real, government function, concerned domestic challenges). half-assed efficacy one thing, safety risk profiles another. vaccine rushed market like poses significant concerns adverse events. yeah, antibodies confer immunity months... combine American penchant disregarding safety guidelines generally, Jan 2021 looking ominous. vaccinated people show re-infection inside year, could induce mass panic. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace Great news! Good job science! Buffalo. People walking outside stuff usually don‚Äôt maybe 60% do. inside stores places mandate I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs close 99% people wearing them. confused people want case. worst case scenario people‚Äôs wet dreams lol really though. Strongmen don‚Äôt (or rarely) bench, train squats reps max weight, train partial ROM deadlifts full. sports aren‚Äôt similar. definitely saw drop usage going NJ even dog one Indiana tell side person supports mask usage. hopeful wont relevant thoughts time vaccine comes around commenter April trying argue Florida way better places ""good"" shutdown laws obviously going stay way rest year. kept listing ""evidence"" true despite shooting one them. hope he's learned lesson. I'm sure Fla prefers 157 deaths per 1m residents NY's 1,618 deaths per 1m residents

But clearly feeling superior ignoring facts Sounds like beginning joke  find something, I'd interested know either way people true scum earth. I‚Äôve worked people truly need service animals fake pets disgusting. Think many people death row life ended found guilty DNA. one extreme cases, thousands prison something do. 

Beyond reasonable doubt, sad joke. Sorry wasn‚Äôt clear. camps cancelled counselors contact infected person. enough cancel camps summer. reasoning protect children staff wasn‚Äôt safe.

If county thinks outdoor summer camps aren‚Äôt safe, think school officials announced safety everyone involved, county canceling Parks Recreation summer camps scheduled begin Monday. lot market are. test 98% specificity, 1% population disease, 2/3 positive tests erroneous. Trump literally suggested allowing plague run unchecked initially denying existence. 

I guarantee current plan. administration lacks competency address issue hiding deaths allowing run rampant plan B. 

It seems likely Trump also petulant almost certain defeat election trying cause much damage possible. Yet r/coronavirus never acknowledge data showing overwhelming non-deadly virus healthy people. get they're worried people blame vote wreck everything create mega breakuot?

Do American voters people forgive that? ""O well made us get sick corona died, lemme vote again, great job Fire Department"" weekend Get piece shit office asap. followed story Diamond Princess, saw writing wall stocked up, too. extra things shopping trip well-prepared without leave people without. fact, even shared things co-worker, got grumbles spouse, that's part extra for. Years* FTFY Yes, we're dire conditions lockdown.  agree, person commented completely valid points imo political career going tens thousands Texans die direct result incompetence. Chicagoland checking in. 100% masks stores. 50% masks walking around neighborhood. something I‚Äôm okay with, don‚Äôt wear mask bicycle stores. vibe. literally devastating take virus seriously, must recognized ruining mean RUINING people. numbers creeping back Ohio. Wrong. percent positive lower, median age testing positive lower, know seal nursing homes, 2 proven treatments cures, help I'm trouble memory now. suspect I've it, wonder it. also bad injury nerve damage, neuropathy nerve pain medication. also spells lightheadedness dizziness. I'm honestly trying figure symptoms coming from. obviously good news insane true. thing really really spread well outside Yeah, anyone gone bar times life knows great place catch colds and/or flu. media cheered thousands people packing together protest everyone stopped caring.  500K deaths morning (global). There‚Äôs need ass people wearing masks. look like? Thanks reply! Turns economy recovers faster healthy workforce. i‚Äôm honestly gonna call right still wins. Biden can‚Äôt stand without campaign staff managing twitter. actually get stage, he‚Äôs done for. hope virus doesn‚Äôt bounce back here. point, think it‚Äôs inevitable happen. taking correct steps tp make sure new outbreaks pkp started non-politically charged way refer civil servant employees around multiple administrations, conspiracy terminology. last sentence huge issue. amount money spent nursing homes long term care facilities huge. money redirected help families take care aging loved ones, quality life seniors would vastly improved. striking 30-40 people got infected. Fair enough, think wrong.

I wish we'd riot America tested close enough. know - loans, grants, forcing companies create tests &amp; supplies. make states compete other.

Daily testing would literally allow economy resume almost normal. Yes, there's changes details, important factor imo, universal help industries. 

That's mentioned first, smaller solutions. apples apples situation.

it practically impossible get tested early on, people would get worse worse symptoms go ER tested....but everyone got tested early on.

still ways go get top FL. Father‚Äôs Day last week Weird North East able to...

If shut things can‚Äôt anything. Mass repeat infections yet observed talking science.

Also, forget disease quite mild OVERWHELMING VAST MAJORITY persons. such, even one contract virus twice, expected cause mild symptoms again. such, good thing people insufficient genetic makeup die first time around.

Natural selection - makes bitches fall love science. wear mask 90% time. people see wear all. go thrift store shopping weekends worse there. Making think poor people less likely wear (all races). high end grocery store go house people wearing one. anecdote. takes one superspreader event. look South Korea. Yep made decision move kid public school K12 online learning, free public reduction online. 

I assume schools try weird hybrid approach end getting shut every week due new case COVID. lack experience teachers teaching online made make switch coming year fully online school least years. Florida decreasing testing too. Birx's presentation last briefing Friday - looks like 40 persist pure market economics despite many failures? Worst case scenario collapse medical system global gdp mass starvation epidemics collapse interconnected systems Netflix going offline State UE benefits run longer $600 per week CARES Act. F/e, relative continue receiving weekly UE payment September. 

I wouldn‚Äôt count extension $600 per week. Congress won‚Äôt extend incentive work. Tuesday Monday there‚Äôs biggest vulnerability for-profit system. I‚Äôm wrong. Bowling allies back open SC.

Yes agree - bars necessarily exist people want make non-sober judgments essentially *must* wear mask really work. Surely hospitals must overrun deaths beginning skyrocket, no? 

What New York‚Äòs historic incompetence (not blaming front line workers much administration) colored early perceptions virus? 

And new cases skewing far toward people simply walk days (like me, incidentally)?

At point breathless headlines new cases growth going seem strange alongside falling death numbers Lmao one favorite movies, fact.  Less half people wearing masks public NH, observations past week. He‚Äôs going lose, reddit echo chamber 80%, many wear **correctly**? Technically wearing chin, eyes, nose hanging counts ""wearing"" mask. go grocery shopping sometimes rarely people wear correctly mouth nose. Spoken like true teenager mean ... dead may never die, right? Last time New York fell down. 

Everyone kept walking right me. great story! That's weird...I swear 2 weeks ago Protesting lol...and Virus matter Fox claim entertainment news escape responsbility. Fox News ruining country isn‚Äôt really anything new. necessarily. attitude mostly irreproachable COVID, specially given current White House. honestly might fuck Trump.

""Oh, Trump says we're evil, yet WE'RE going ones save all. Say ""Thank Mr. CCP"" we'll rescue evil American Government.""

And people might fuck Coronavirus. However, ideas bullshit align scientific evidence, others not. Nope. Lol he‚Äôs not. difference time around, hope, democratic primary much less contentious, ""no Biden"" sentiment. Anyone fence going pushed either direction Biden, said Trump, certainly pushed anyone brain away. still plenty people voting brains vote him, looking respite circus reality TV show he's turned country feel comfortable going Biden, time without feeling conflicted candidate. americans fekd. RIP. basically risk? I‚Äôm getting daily rate. Maybe even IV drip.

COVID + Flu = 1-2 punch. originally reported the¬†Times San Diego¬†last week, proceeding Washington State Consumer Protection Act (CPA), provides: ‚ÄúUnfair methods competition and¬†unfair deceptive acts practices¬†in conduct of¬†any trade commerce¬†are hereby declared Yankee fludle dandy Luxembourg shutting again? Israel running beakfirst second wave rn Glad hear it. scary. 50% US adults responded survey.

The remaining 50% busy attending Trump rallies protesting ""tyranny"" front town halls. June 14 two Sundays ago US posted 20,170 new cases. doubled 40,000+ last three days. know several people, including medical files &amp; front lines, reject it. 

Their argument can‚Äôt get testing right, makes us think get vaccine

Take prepare, lot states didn‚Äôt lockdowns secure supplies help prepare hospitals Covid patients. Also give time testing contact tracing. Hospitals weren‚Äôt prepared time handle patients. main reason shutdowns wasn‚Äôt Covid numbers. Also call flatten curve never answer actually stopping virus. AZ taking seriously too. Seriously trying crush speed run record stupidity. strip Las Vegas. Clark County unincorporated Bc supposed use time decrease cases establish testing contact tracing could prevent resurgence. Instead, politicians catered bunch conspiracy nuts, reopened early, squat. ultimate test politician tell going running. handle things reasonably anticipated things happen. mark presidency US crisis management. Said say, so-called leadership US failed miserably. doctor 10hour surgery fine. wearing 20 minute shopping trip kill you. Even mask. True, what's also important rate hospitalization. people 18-49 age range, 2.5%, may sound low, also milder cases exactly 'mild.' However, long fully recover, real damage done. 2.5% get hospitalized (and probably 95% live) we're finding high percentage might permanent damage. die, there's high chance permanent damage. Still looking data percent permanent damage would like classified different severities damage. Also, I'm curious people sticky blood percentage go away? Cause they'll blood thinners life.

Edit: 2.5% actually correct. based rate 100k population, read chart wrong, quite correct statistic. Yup shitty recommendation CDC. Glad governor figured bad idea, unfortunately many died moved 2000 miles across country.  


We stayed Airbnbs system: immediately wipe surfaces Clorox wipes special attention high-touch surfaces. we'd gather bedding toss washer/dryer. healthy dose lysol disinfecting spray around final measure. 


On drive, packed cooler food eat limit dining out. get fast food occasion, careful sanitize ordered hot food.  


We plan gas stations, quick use bathroom system well: Face mask + Clorox wipe. Touch surfaces using Clorox wipe, hands. Move quickly someone sick nearby exposed long. hand sanitizer get back car, another safety measure (despite washed hands restroom).  


That almost 2 weeks ago signs either us falling ill (me husband). We'll ""in clear"" 2 week quarantine Wednesday, fingers crossed! r/coronavirus

Good news vaccine possibly ready October: unimpressed Drake face

Anxiety inducing piece insanely misleading title: impressed Drake face. I'm longer trusting polls then. all. ever actually interacted child? like China India money? Yeah TX thinks fear Coronavirus emotional condition. Assholes. one could done better job Trump. 

Seriously, office vacant, would better. sorry. gives hope hear least places US still sense community. Well different cases. weeks numbers much different. 

Right cases New York 20 every thousand people.

Florida 6.

Plus half new Yorks population lives single city whereas Florida's population lives around entire state. 

For nearly condensed New York think infected almost 1/3 amount New York is.

Also talking asking questions. guy quoted really wrong numbers corrected deleted comment understand everyone much cunt think are, dick head. No, said get grip dramatic six-time Tony-winning actress Audra McDonald. woman still right Ridiculous... Virus dead while.. mean attention whore Chris Coumo getting CNN's coverage basement sick feels like dying. praised media fact he's got caught family wearing mask. brother douchebag's. say cause I'm better peasants. Statistically speaking, 1% general population psychopaths 4% general population sociopaths. "" US performs worse quality life cost living calculations EU countries well as...""

I'm surprised, US 10 times population countries combined (California people Canada, Texas people Australia), that's considering vastness culture lifestyles United States country like Japan homogenous built entirely different precedent altogether. hope see would differences based problem alone along multitude variables. Australia grew size along similar history growth guarantee would similar

""I find natural people react anger"" saying half country leader nazis, racist, sexist, retarded, tone deaf representatives make egregious statements like, ""If like Donald Trump, aint black"" ""If white, know like poor, know like stopped police..."", meme-reddit front constantly spam pictures making fun Trump nothing anything like drinking water, ton racism directed towards white-women spamming Karen shit virtue signal talking black issues. hundreds thousands millions alike, really help cause sole reason lost, solve problems too. fine """"loud minority"""" (lazy, cliche, horseshit argument) significant enough dictate major perception United States come keep picturing putz white house bottle snake oil hands, standing back wagon , wearing shit eating grin, hat like willie wonka. Sorry doc people ignorant stupid both. anyone brain understands shit. Learned predispositions, analysis thats much work. volumes written human behavior humans dont read fucking books. doctors came support BLM protests? think doctors impartial politics, naive. No, vaccines try program immune system. Vaccines makes immune system remember illnesses quicker produce lymphocytes next time. Production money end all, fact part increase standard living. US generally worse education system, poorer healthcare outcomes, worse social protection, worse workers rights, worse animal rights, worse consumer rights, less press freedom, less socioeconomic mobility, higher inequality countries mentioned. 

Greta really big deal Europe, already understand implications climate change. Germany tell anybody do, know gave idea. forget violent cops! worked theres one thing Texans have, state pride. onsidering city (Philadelphia) already hit hard Covid once, held largest ongoing protests country last month. simply making claim simply yet seen trend surges cases cities held large protests 

And Philly starting spike right schedule - Iran closest curves US, interesting compare dates expect things lowest new cases 2nd spike came May 2. Deaths stopped falling May 17 pretty flat May 31st rise started again.

The US bottomed June 9. continues similar Iran, expect flat deaths June 24‚ÄîJuly 8 accelerating increase.  Nah, still charge virus fee kind. basically zero possibility general population getting vaccine October, FYI. Even everything goes perfectly, early 2021 incredibly optimistic. whatever course action decide on, we'd better prepared continue 2021.

I agree children option remote learning, particularly high risk high risk family members. cannot effectively participate remote learning, hope in-person school option. also mentioned teaching really time, especially teach little ones like do. pretty much run ragged worn time lunch comes. didn‚Äôt get 20 minute lunch break I‚Äôd probably burn quickly. It‚Äôs also one times actually get go bathroom day.

I also don‚Äôt see jamming 25 six year-olds small room open windows eat lunch going really help much, especially since buses undoubtedly running like usual, mingling closely kids is. Life, liberty, pursuit happiness... last part likely meant ability help fellow men contribute society. unfair properly compensated needs addressed. yes politically driven absolutely many business families going bankrupt. don‚Äôt know solution millions Americans default cause job income going pretty. Thanks essential worker. God bless Ok half? heat? Jesus Christ bro, go somewhere else someone hit chronic illness youth, let said anyone thinks death troubling outcome disease extremely short-sighted. buy bag 25 50 adhesive flexible aluminum nose bridges eBay Etsy bucks -- highly recommend. take wash cloth mask. evac shelter glorified facility lol. protects family, would rather see 1000 maga masks every day see wearing all. good bad. Good less people dying, definitely. bad part infections means higher chance people vulnerable categories catch it. 

If pick 'more cases less deaths' 'less cases deaths', would pick former. someone supports trump also supports WEARING FUCKING MASK, yeah think would work. lot idiots side aisle. Man really need stop testing safe bars. That's works right? wondering California usually included list articles. seeing around 6,000-7,000 new cases per day. seems expected added list, still idea happen sooner. muh contatoot'nal write ta squirt snot hue.  Yeah, I'm afraid going higher all. I'd bet close 300k year, especially fraction excess deaths added Tracker showing 381 Nevada yesterday. Maybe al counties report? Oh happened long time ago let oligarchs country piece shit rewarded morality punished. maybe ""Liberal"" party stop pushing gun bans bullshit draconian laws. real MVP. live Japan right now. exactly right. People also asked stay home... did. huge difference wearing mask stand people give looks. one confronts Japan society personal responsibility feeling shame following guidelines. america, people actually confronting mask wearers shaming them!!! course cases non mask wearers kicked places make much confusing everyone. Wear mask yelled at. wear mask get yelled at. heck going there!?! Yeah that‚Äôs terrible opportunity? people selling body bags cemetary plots? data showing immunity surviving wears 4 months so, consider may never cure everyone catch twice year. I'm still holding prediction half billion dead five years. Misleading headline. haven‚Äôt even begun peak  Ah yes. Hard explain someone one. Spring nice. Cherry blossoms, festivals, nice weather. hayfever killer me. Hope great trip means people personal rights, sometimes rights restricted good society. wanted kill people, I'd stopped good society. put prison (say aforementioned attempt kill someone), movement would restricted good society. masks. global pandemic everyone wear masks help keep spread thus keep everyone safe. don‚Äôt know anyone dosen‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt real. Also, incredibly irresponsible stupid go vacation deadly pandemic. easily digestible. fantastic job presenting data.  feel like I've seen movie Chinese, Italian, American dialect English. America getting ready remake already? /s know it‚Äôs 2020 grateful circle ‚Äúpro mask‚Äù major pandemic.  talking Roy Moore? thought ages ago every 10 people see many would say wear mask? game plan 1 hard lock-down gradual re-opening would position. would similar position EU right getting ready enjoy summer......  Japan. issue America people think wearing piece fabric face difficult inconvenient. US 9th Deaths per capita. Italy Cool opinion, bro. Prove it.

so think not? take stance. Doesn‚Äôt sound like worst thing they‚Äôve done (very unfortunately). friend telling Roman Reigns couldn‚Äôt wrestle Bc immunocompromised beating leukemia WWE erased history books don‚Äôt allow wrestlers mention him. shittiest things could imagined Vince‚Äôs position, couldn‚Äôt even come Roman. Fox News? bars need closed cure vaccine. It‚Äôs reality one wants accept.

Can‚Äôt wear mask drinking.

Drunk people can‚Äôt distance.

So many surfaces touched. Prople don‚Äôt wash hands.

Air conditioning.

Drinking home solution. 

I‚Äôm sorry work at/own bar. get government support. Houston ‚Äúunique‚Äù issues too. remember terrible floods back explaining used floodplain areas weren‚Äôt supposed build pave allow natural drainage, Houston basically said YOLO floods really badly certain conditions. Urban planning, really strong suit there. sounds like riveting show he's got going there.  probably is. know way override physics cure obesity day two majority US population? great. stop worrying covid. since that's possible, need focus done slow spread. There's justice here. There's virus killing people regardless whether deserve not.

Don't ass China (and EU) lock US long choose. Really, exactly zero Americans essential either place. avid mask wear wearer, mask mandate never abused, government tracker app definitely could. would super easy government tracker like pandemic go ""well already them, let's keep way"". would totally abused American law enforcement system. already issues racism discrimination based upon zip code, would greatly increase law enforcement access location time. agree! author book Pale Horse says likely started response 1918 pandemic never stopped it. Unlike US people thing now. No, people keep anti bac everything 600k people 

That also assumes hospitals overwhelmed really path we‚Äôre right Blue Ridge Mountains. miss food yoga. that...nope. Couldn‚Äôt stay two things wanted start family. one sick tracking who‚Äôs coming country, don‚Äôt need masks. you‚Äôre chaos world US don‚Äôt even know many people sick, masks necessity. Seriously people even eat out?

Because worked 10 hours want spend another 2 kitchen prepping, making, enjoying, cleaning delicious hot meal.

There's reason intentionally obtuse personally enjoy cooking.  Yes read [about patterns lung disease seen CT scan caused several factors. ""It little bit fluid lungs, sometimes little blood lung sometimes small area inflammation lung,"" says Dr. Neil Schluger, chief pulmonary, allergy critical care medicine Columbia University Medical Center. ""When look images, see looks like small areas inflammation see many kinds lung asymptomatic cases mild lung inflammation signs illness, pulmonologists say they're likely kick infection quickly see lasting lung suspect that, followed asymptomatic people several months, CT scans would completely normal unless known later develop symptoms,"" Taylor-Cousar says.

Facts aren‚Äôt bad. don‚Äôt know interpret them. man sorry came way I‚Äôm happy getting something people bills kids. It‚Äôs hard ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù see dumbass people know abusing it. think covid overblown follow money many commercials big brands pushing COVID related advertising it‚Äôs constant news cycle lot misinformation getting spread around. Yes believe covid real I‚Äôm one people lethality blown. never life seen something pushed hard media sides. Right around time mortal enemy, Soviet Union, died. major enemies must united.

I alive then. Prior that, felt like focused country USSR. fell away, civility one another. Ok link single one agencies specifically saying numbers caused corona?

Have considered deaths caused corona attributed? looked CDC data shows average expected deaths well upperbounds expected deaths versus actual total deaths? background data science would make expert understanding manipulating data agencies providing would give reason cast doubt? medical professional understands better doctors health experts killing people? Ugh. I'm exactly spring chicken. state done great job I'd wrestling *again* decision teaching worth dying for. Yes, financial future would toilet, least alone watching pandemic flush future. I'm sorry close horrific choice. 

If ever time unions, now. Ditto fear become infected. first time scary, I‚Äôm scared get again. I‚Äôve read conflicting reports long antibodies last. Correction Australians Asian Heritage. I'm sorry hear people writing things you. social media interactions worst. 

My concern people stringing together pieces positive evidence suggest problem, need wear masks, political ploy. clarified position, see certainly apply you. hope sensitive positive evidence get twisted beyond meaning. Basically, think danger understatement significantly greater overstatement right now. (That could change, course.)

Anyway, thank responding honestly explaining yourself. Fly Delta, forget AA.... Americans started pandemic strong feeling solidarity, unlike days Sept. 11th, 2001. closed businesses, stayed inside, made masks wiped groceries. country often riven politics, polls showed broad agreement shutting right thing months mixed messages left many exhausted wondering much worth it. always certain percentage going believe even dinosaurs conspiracy they're real. end going like there's threat, end leaving trails super predators super sense smell fuck community that's hiding months. muh freedoms!!

The sun heat going kill it!!

15 0 cases lickety split!!

Look economy rebound!!

Wearing mask may kill me!!

It's conspiracy slowly control us!! point don‚Äôt think people without masks allowed airports. live low cost living state $1200 check joke. ""thinking"" sending another one. Can't wait influx vids r/publicfreakout can't enforce masks enforce public nudity entering store without pants shoes? saying ignore medical experts say stuff dont like

Lol Great points. love bill burr said joe recently:

[""Oh God! tough fuckin' open nose record player isn‚Äôt going make happy, tell based outlook. Turns women attractive masks too. ""NOT KAREN.

Second third stimulus check $600 unemployment needs extended right goddamn fucking now. Musk Rogan tools. Hopefully first one coming July also unjustified backed actual statistics data. Homosexuals faced still facing lot unjust discrimination world, barred donating blood part that. 

When Gay bisexual men make 86% HIV diagnoses among men US example, less 5% male population, that's discrimination, that's trying protect public health. Airlines always teetering Japan Korea people wear masks even common cold. sheer politeness spread around. see one month old comment. state it? situation changed we're back exponential rise phase US. might want read article comment. arrested contempt court walking out, wear face mask. try pull mask far put glasses mask bit seems fog much. says inflammation lungs \*when they're sick\*. say anything long-term permanent issues.

Getting sick they're broke stay home Nah..It 90% dependent upon virulence transmission modalities. one much higher 60% immunity may fleeting. systematically taught think absolutes **pick sides**. side says something, without considering consequences people.

Another reason like keep roof head, food belly, phone/TV/internet, another strong motivator. know say gonna less deadly. imagine conversation now. 

Hey Bro let's go bar.

What virus? 

That shit man. Nobody's dying anymore. CDC says less deadly.  Herd immunity least 80%. even close. protests outside people wore masks. can't tell sarcastic brainwashed moron !RemindMe 4 weeks ‚Äúprotest cases‚Äù Los Angeles also reopened three weeks ago, accounts recent upswing new coronavirus cases.

Really; going try harder this. soon someone posts scientific evidence permanent lung damage notable risk factor, I'll listen. seen study yet says anything effect. Would guessed ricks harpers makes sense too. testing btw.... employer cannot discriminate/retaliate/punish employee based medical disability. stand due ADA numerous employment laws. 

It scary government wants pass laws discriminate illness. rule largest impact lower socioeconomic individuals. sorry. I'm Maine, many elderly winter Florida. came back north early. We've managed keep numbers low governor absolutely brutal. takes LOT heat anti-mask group, ultimately majority grateful see rest country exploding.

With tourists summer residents pouring in, I'll shocked spike, especially conservative west north mask wearing frowned upon 

I get it. rabid making everyone around wear them. can't tolerate thick fabric ones, wear flimsy surgical ones least. get face shield! Aaaaarrggghhhhhhhh!!!! Let local favorites know decision. president point blank says take responsibility. Seriously. 

No one charge. pop testing sites reaching capacity need reservation get tested. hundred day. happening Central Florida. many people can't get test? numbers probably much much worse. know common sentiment mask topic - aren‚Äôt Americans also top charitable donations volunteer efforts?

I‚Äôm sure masks gone backwards don‚Äôt follow narrative Americans categorically caring others. magnificent bastard Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama serious trouble way New York, Washington, California earlier year- really wish president could use moment bridge cultural divide remind everyone isnt political problem.

Yeah wheres lie tho closed early right thing, well states did. money line suddenly sing different tune. 3-4 weeks, Record deaths. think protests good expression outrage also think incredibly stupid terms containing Covid-19. I‚Äôm sure people trying act like can‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs Facebook testing everyone pulse sick people Florida pretty much putting peak NY #'s.... also far easier socially distance outside vs bar, example know? used laugh America leper colony line V Vendetta. Yea. /s. I'll take L forgetting data testing protests shows positivity rate 1% - population background. 2 1245 protesters found positive another cohort. Probably better talk stuff don‚Äôt know much about. First all, covid SARS. virus less virulent onset, multiple doctors Italy USA attested virus appears become even less virulent past months. need sequencing studies confirm true, deaths Florida Texas don‚Äôt rise much next weeks, provide reasonable indication virus become less severe treatments improved much negative outcomes less likely.

While it‚Äôs important acknowledge risks disease, need reasonable it. People literally commented things like ‚Äúcovid-19 shave 20 years average human lifespan‚Äù. several take single case study showing unusual reaction extrapolate entire population. There‚Äôs moderation scientific accuracy here, way r/COVID19, people able make ridiculous statements get away it. can't build muscle mass running outside... strongest lockdowners way even allowed looks like there's progress inactivated vaccines, would definitely give immunocompromised solution! Hi! FYI, context, word you‚Äôre looking *sow*, *sew*. *Sewing* act fastening things stitching together. *Sowing* planting, either literally or, case, figuratively. Cheers! ooooo scary tech man inject microchip vaccine ooo /s problem mask doesn‚Äôt really help get sick, washing hands that.

Instead mask helps prevent getting people sick.

Basically people wearing masks likely infect others don‚Äôt symptoms. insurance companies could probably use basis lawsuit, would need show person didn‚Äôt wear mask caused get sick. sad thing idiots states also traveling FL bring back virus states decline.  Meanwhile zeroth-world China...  ask speak Covid-19's manager? Dentists dental assistants always wear masks, would aerosol spray drill would worry me.
I would stay away well Actually, countries, including Peru Chile, experiencing higher SARS-CoV-2 rates America. America still coronavirus'd country world sheer number yeah, asking country almost good. It‚Äôs ‚Äúargument‚Äù, studies contact tracing conducted. Want links?

I'm much government imposed mask wearing, seriously wear damn mask. big inconvenience prevent terrible pandemics. Okay everyone know qualified doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs case everyone else though. college student, many classmates position still pay rent own. two siblings also college also dependents. parents made enough money last year qualify stimulus, therefore none us get anything, except two us qualified cares act unemployment. doesn‚Äôt account fact they‚Äôre still helping us pay three tuitions right one persons salary. aren‚Äôt unique cases.

So unclear Corona infact less deadly, accurately diagnosed now. think latter, still early confirm feel terrible everyone virus locked family businesses closing mention riots looting suicides up. sucks right now, things get better hope trust God. Hope everything works man. things wrong comment, far worst idea wait testing positive consider avoiding elderly people engaging risky behaviour. Actually listening Italian doctors advise leaders. mess. 

Over /r/coronavirusma we're freaking 2.5% going small minded, seem small minded, Smaleigh NC.

I'm suggesting UV also inefficient unless strong enough cause skin eye damage - need strong reaches people order meaningful sterlising effect viruses breathe every single breath.

TL:DR; until/unless vaccine released containment predominantly sufficient, people safe congregating indoors close proximity. institution saying otherwise company selling (definitely bogus) sterilsing products punished enough make hurt cannot back claims actual evidence. recall China, incredibly infectious virus is, dont think anyone would going bars right now. remember happening NYC. lines people stretchers going door. Here's South Carolina's latest 7-day charts cases deaths, plus running ranking terms per capita deaths:

 Meanwhile USA track hit 4 digit deaths within month go business EVERYONE works unemployed, scared. That's decent thing do. makes sense.

You can't pandemic without people getting sick, unless everyone hides bed. business stay open without customers. Customers need people serve them. means people get sick. Sorry hear that! talking Italy? thought untreatable Patriots? Florida low death count. virus already ravaged NYC Italy. everyone comes physical distancing bubbles?

My (33f) partner (33m) initially included families bubbles. Neither families going except groceries. things opening up, family going lot (gym, casino, salons) brother moved random roommates. 

My family many high risk factors including 5 year old niece immunodeficient. work parents house. help brother two girls wife work home day care/school longer option. 

My family isn‚Äôt comfortable family going brother moved random roommates. would either mean stop working partner stops seeing family.

Like North Eastern states numbers lot higher data shows due lack testing early.

It may significantly contagious flu, yes. casino's fault? may true, relevant all. casino can't tell Congress do. virus fucking monstrosity getting started. world better accept reality look papers models second see room fire. Yeah, totally agree sad thing Arizona, probably viewed idiot actually aware. 

At least they're citing date data ""prove wrong"" (sorry I'll stop passive aggressive). well. Countries much less cases need many tests control it. got many tests still failing control it. 

Example: two countries 100 million people. 

One 500 cases per day, tests 10.000 people per day. 
One 50.000 cases tests 50.000 people per day. 

You need math genius see failing testing. second country 5 times tests per million people, would need 100 times more. 

You failed beginning pandemic, lock thinking tests holy trail pandemic control: no, not. 

Tests used prevention. 
A months ago USA little testing, lot cases. testing people stop people spreading around. 

In result, infection rate drop (also used wisely also death rate cause check e.g. Nursing homes). USA failed this. 

Now got many infections control therefore testing bit help much more. Rushed economical reasons. peak Covid-19 Egypt happened May, March/April Europe. lack transparency testing, appreciate magnitude disaster need find ICU bed loved one. going 25,000 EGP night couple weeks ago. Well, see what's America went pretty smooth. amount people taking rules serious way big. lot people think flu worst. know I'm perfect always follow rules, least try.

See answer service animal ""documentation"" service animal ""did yourself"" (or hired ""agency"" themselves). different? take risks die. Drive carefully, dont run scissors,wear masks reduce chances contracting relatively dangerous new coronavirus, get vaccines, etc, etc. 

And we're preventing it. Easy that.

Indoor, large groups people, longer periods time. Birthday parties, nightclubs bars, choir practice church gatherings, etc.

About month ago huge gathering Toronto park, estimated 10,000 people. beautiful day, people sick lockdown went outside drink socialize. far know reported outbreaks event.

Again evidence makes really nervous upcoming fall winter. Thank much offer, sweet. Thankfully family helps buying supplies. Schools always need donations, especially low income. think that's right. find data confusing. know easy cherry pick photos anecdotes, like go back Google mobility reports see there's really spike activity. E.g. Tokyo, looks like retail recreation went -50% baseline mid-May -23% baseline -- real increase. 

On hand, data US states, neither protests bar openings really show up. Take Texas California, spiking oast week two. Harris County TX retail recreation looks basically flat around 15-20% baseline (possibly reopening started way back May 1, although bars supposed remain closed May 22). LA County gone 40% baseline 30% baseline, increase, pretty slow period. Similar story parks

So people going bars protests (which expect would show retail recreation since lot protests central retail/business districts) showing clearly mobility data.

It may need lot people pick public place (laughing bar screaming protest) take back ""bubble"" spread everyone else caseloads spike. perhaps there's something different qualitatively people CA TX behaving public places -- bunching together four weeks ago would spaced out.

An emergency alert sent minutes city reported 795 new¬†COVID-19¬†cases. brings city‚Äôs total number cases 9,652. ]

""The city recorded highest number cases...""

""That brings city's total cases to...""

Article states ""the city"" Bexar County. 

Maybe article misleading regardless, good luck San Antonio.  Reddit say social distancing bullshit masks save humanity? good news I'm NC think distribution something that's heavily overlooked. 

I live triangle I'm near three MAJOR hospitals. someone needs lifevaced that's they're taken. sister immunocompromised comes almost 2 hours away treatment hospitals, quality elsewhere. things like cancer. 

If get swamped lot people going fucked, covid patients. need kinds critical care. GA. called set test today. go Ohio week business get tested go precaution. Fun times. think exposed time. Risk low. First person infected. would shouting, coughing, sneezing spray enough viral load would get you. viral load would need get mouth nose eyes great enough dose get sick. id happened day earlier, definitely showing symptoms yet. Takes roughly five fourteen days show symptoms. Definitely 24 hours. HOWEVER showing real non-psychosymatic symptoms (that anxiety driven) possible exposed earlier date, cough fever emerge definitely get checked out. something Governor Dewine said beginning lockdown. can't find quote, effect said beginning aware lockdown worked, people would say overreacted, right. like people stop taking antibiotics end prescribed course, fell better think need them. makes initial time effort wasted infection comes back. What! I'm shocked! could enclosed space people caring social distance possibly spread virus.

This exactly stopped talking oldest brother girlfriend soon lock lifted state went restaurant. think worded comment wrong probably blood clot somewhere... virus unfound damage internal organ. same, it‚Äôs ignorant death rate hasn‚Äôt stated real research.

Dumb politicization get go one biggest points.
As many see, literally politicize everything, eating banana (""exploitation banana farmers dveleoping countries"", ""environmental damage monoculture farming"") whether coronavirus dangerous. interest behind it, politicize it. thing is, US chose politicize dumbest way possible fighting pandemic time. countries much better strategy regards politics.

Then failure CDC public health labs keep good testing regime up.

Then failure huge part society even take seriously, let alone comply simplest things.

Then lack good social safety net made economic issue pressing one, people states literally choice due financial survival budget concerns.

This compound issue. thinking that:
It virus, isn‚Äôt vampire come night! Lol  Fair enough phone issue, mobile version site even worth using. 

Assuming ""a bunch deaths people covid actually die it"" dangerous territory, however. Covid tends kill people co-morbidities. indeed make deaths gray area. covid kill them, heart disease (as example) kill them? many cases co-morbidity in, covid along issue compromises body's ability fight whatever else dealing with. 

It's impossible know co-morbidity would fatal without covid, health officials doctors make best guess. Now, fully admit some, perhaps many 22.4k deaths wrongly attributed covid, half equation.

On side coin, missing covid deaths, two main reasons.

1) early phases (when highest death NYC occurring), massive shortage testing. Many people dying diagnosed covid, make statistics. assume happening significantly less often now, deaths already slowed dramatically. 

2) count deaths happen hospitals nursery homes. Everyone dies outside make count. one huge. NYC, average day 911 responds 35 ""found unknown causes"" calls. peak covid run, ballooned 200 calls day. That's extra 165 people every day found dead known cause. 0 counted towards covid statistics, likely covid deaths.

So yes, 22.4k real covid deaths, also undercounting deaths. I've heard couple health professionals worried over-counting, significantly health professionals believe undercounting overall. instinct says place like NYC offsetting official number pretty close correct overall, that's mostly pulling ass.

There states I'm 100% convinced undercounting fairly significantly. look rapid surge ""pneumonia"" deaths (dramatically years) know something fishy going on. Mfs bout getting sued 30 billion dollars üòÇüòÇüòÇ Cool, advisor college took drug discovery class. makes wonder genuinely interested information took 5 seconds Google verify first heard someone say it.

Asking source fine specific study represents data obscure information published random journal.

Just search ""average age new coronavirus cases"" plethora articles sources come up.

For example, source comes says 60% new cases Florida people 45. Multiple sources mention average age drippong coronavirus cases, more.

If took 5 seconds look up. *really* interested, would forth minimal effort asking source (which heard elsewhere). virus killed 26,000 black Americans today. Police violence deserves protested absolutely reformed, absolute fraction death virus brought bring.

Alot lab studied virus's mixed hiv protein genes higher contagion studies. far fetched say wuhan lub done fucked one somehow able replicate got old news updates whether anything helpful came this. Yeah, saw story covid patients getting lung clots. One guy taken seriously talked someone else symptoms insisted CT scan. 

The knowledge virus evolving quickly doctors seem gathering data know residual effects. Like one kid class messed whole class got punished year now, recovered COVID-19 patient suddenly start showing worst symptoms? Texas using convention centers set hospital overflow. People's infectiousness begin 2-4 days prior symptoms onset. get tested, false negatives associated people testing early, develop symptoms later get tested again. Test accuracy peak either day symptom onset 3 days symptoms onset, ask local testing center recommend need another test future. Take care. Hmm, brabant bit outlier since outbreak early enough testing capacity. Currently anyone call hotline get tested, current/active cases pretty accurate. still miss lot pre-/asymptomatic people, affect number hospitalizations/deaths also showing good numbers weeks now.

### Abstract

Although exact origin SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2, etiologic agent COVID‚Äê19, currently unknown, substantial evidence suggest source transmission virus occurred within Wuhan wet market. markets, bats wild animals frequently sold stored close contact. several world's past pandemics, bats essential spread zoonotic diseases bat another animal humans directly. Live animal markets create perfect conditions novel viruses COVID‚Äê19 emerge. paper suggests prevent future pandemics, sale exotic animals banned wet markets. also advocates integration analysis illicit trade study zoonotic disease transmission pandemics. Heh, suggest something right you‚Ä¶ look like guy who‚Äôs denying allegations raped someone frat party lol got mono 22 years later lymph nodes neck permanently swollen perfectly healthy. sick, swell even point difficult breath sitting standing straight up. straight want risk getting coronavirus, especially since shit zoonotic, telling fuck happen people road. Two reasons 


1) We've consistently overstating risk transmission outdoor environments. maintaining distancing \*or\* wearing mask, risk outdoor transmission negligible. 


2) protests appear created net increase people leaving homes, even people stayed home avoid them.  sure does.

Welcome comrade! don‚Äôt think anyone saying protests didn‚Äôt result spread. It‚Äôs matter degrees. Based know importance inside vs outside masks vs masks, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs plausible protests distant second behind indoor dining ‚Äúparties.‚Äù UK cases going down. US cases massively surging.

\-Currently- UK much better keeping control learned lesson (albeit bit late). US never learned lesson seems. biggest concern recent overpoliticization judiciary. Find right judge get TRO PI. Even (when) that's reversed appeal, gives anti-mask people ammo talk rights. course, appellate court wrong according many them. 

BTW, hope able stay safe right court. Ever heard sandwich?  New york city diet coke could tbe cure cancer. don‚Äôt believe allowing us wear face shields, double check! 
A claim spike related protests, would mean cities protests would spikes. Instead spikes happening 1) states/cities reopened first, 2) also clearly anti-mask: TX, AZ, FL, etc.

Not Washington, DC, NYC, etc. places much larger numbers people protesting, HT couple hours ago. masks usual, still saw several without  saying quote protests based absolutely nothing, really? incredibly ill is. people travel ill family funeral. also say that‚Äôs cause developing many disorders NPD sociopathy. anyone feel sense hopelessness? know way life works things always get better.

I wish lawyer would sue health department question people Oath hell thinking. numbers looking made think good idea? sure hell 8% test positivity number Newsom required.. LA way point. Amazing! EXACTLY. backbone countries workforce (Millennials) taking entire burden risk work jobs older generations walk without mask entitled attitude. thing rural Michigan - maybe quarter people see public wearing masks. Interestingly, correlates precisely percent people (75%) county voted Trump. 

I Detroit area couple weeks ago numbers switched - 75% wearing masks. 

This leave house much now, red county unsafe. I'm PA/Philly too, hope Wolf rolls back openings yellow stop slight uptick. I'm getting nervous seeing creep places Philly's healthcare system. Wolf re-mandate masks, hope comes fines.

I'm pretty optimistic Philly. major complaint people cover damn nose mask, see mask usage 75% walking around west philly/point breeze/fairmount pretty universally 95%+ indoors.

Not good Surely fact ChAd vector non-replicating reduces issues multiple doses time. States people.

Who blaming? US: China lied, covered up, delayed release critical information least 2-3 weeks

Also US: 6+ months later, ""I AIN'T WEARIN GOD DANG MASK, FUCK YOU!"" Pneumonia deaths high year /head scratch Happens. seem mad something even happening haha like nobody currently diverting finds masks ppe constructing sports facility That's spot lol He* 


Sorry Nah, that‚Äôs funeral. understand now. that‚Äôs marketed time. Big agriculture shoved throats name profits consolidation industry.  even guess skin color. Australian here, fucking terrified American friends. went small outdoor get together mom hugged kissed nieces nephews. 

My husband wore masks, brought paper plates plasticware. feel like boomers encountered really want change anything activities. Another 55+ know big graduation party daughter invited everyone office. 

I know why. like think happen them. found sale lately? still haven‚Äôt seen any. translate well via text sorry Thanks! I'll take look.

I meant three months taking seriously, given news week... Likely even that. üåπ mean, alone. many many people downplaying pandemic. Namely President.

We're beginning see ramifications. US watched thousands Italians suffer horrible disaster sat hands. eradicated Italy yet we're still experiencing record numbers every day. Lol, right. There's way get people board it. pointing way differs Bible enough either. would people need most. 

How get people SSN hump back day?  Look politicians let us many ways many different levels. But, like CDC others covered glory. April ""new evidence"" read shamed sociologist NYT op-ed page changed recommendations. indifference came gave trying convince people wear masks interesting. Also, area advise test first day symptoms bc likely get false negative. higher possibility false negatives early infection would also indicate people pre symptomatic likely truly asymptomatic initial lies masks ineffective, feel I've put position scientist. position I'd choose want. since public health authorities untrustworthy. need make judgements things might turn wrong. cant stop idiots morons, basically never refused. Matter fact coronavirus task force headed casino ceo. Soon thereafter: open! casino workers wearing masks fuckhead tourists aren‚Äôt anything responsible casinos weren‚Äôt enforcing fear upsetting g revenue stream.

Well there's way bring enough manufacturing get mass deployment then. It'll awfully convenient announce trial met endpoints early October, pres campaign ""solving"" covid crisis, even halfass effective vaccine. Science takes while. Opinions instantaneous.

WHO fine. CDC muzzled you-know-who.

r/medicine great resource. supposed post medical professional, learn lot by. reading. Treatments developed -- simple ones like proning oxygen rather intubation, along medications. 

It's novel coronavirus, means really new. going take (and note: six months this, three). Maybe safe vaccine developed, year. New York responded one worst outbreaks far aggressive measures managed bring control. They‚Äôre one best performing states US terms new cases. yes, New York model, Florida isn‚Äôt bothering learn example.  states getting fresh outbreaks now, didn‚Äôt part whole time ensure didn‚Äôt happen. missed point. brought guns biological weapon fight. also expensive drug really make sense pump everyone walks door compared relative small effect gives. problem really know going people get bad case greatest benefit, bit cost prohibitive give everyone might get do. true. It‚Äôs called rules, consequences, parenting. kid isn‚Äôt even three yet, loves shopping. get groceries wears mask, spend hours stores finally re-opened? happily wears try shoes look toys. explained rules, didn‚Äôt shop couldn‚Äôt behave, tada. take time find masks didn‚Äôt fall (even tailor made tried different ties, ears bend let fall... turns kid sized disposable masked right her, problem.) cops saying CALL COPS.

Imagine world people trusted scientists science politicians trustworthy peoples wellbeings?? devil say! people don‚Äôt want kids get virus. Apparently not. Trust believe many us shocked you. I'd interested learn listen early called ""Chinese Flu"" ""Wuhan Virus."" 

You think names would got attention viewers worried them. Good job.  start microbiology rotations hospital‚Äôs lab tomorrow. certainly interesting country incapable making even barest sacrifices

Best description I've heard yet. Well now. But, Covid ravages rural areas 10 ICU beds county, people remember places resources, resources. That's we're aiming Cali honestly... closing places considered hot spots, keeping ones open generally safer.

Next step start strict enforcement. Sadly, you‚Äôre probably righteous. heard something radio morning activist Brazil encouraging people go film ERs ‚Äúprove‚Äù they‚Äôre actually empty hospitals lying. official strategy hammer dance. Basically gonna play whack-a-mole virus vaccine. Open much feasible (dance), TTIing much possible.

If TTI possible more, lock-down according criteria defined federal govt (Hammer). dance again.

We indefinetely, better TTI testing outbreak clusters become smaller smaller. Even another fuck-up like meat plant big cluster re-emerges seems manageable. virus believed transmitted eating food destroyed digestion acids stomach. greater risk getting virus hands touching eyes, nose **mouth**. 

Am one confused here? Seeing pandemics throughout human history like total blindside. preparation (there plans place event subesquently thrown window) reaction completely fumbled. Majorly. Pathetically. man failure leader. Universal open Time us canadian build wall? Nah, won‚Äôt that, let suspiciously increasing Alaskan ‚Äúcross‚Äù country option.

Also Ohioan here. seems dependent store side town experience. see it, don't. problem phrase soon fucken idea soon actually is. Right states completely locked 3 months, like PA, phased reopenings seeing small blips may turn 2nd wave. bad. Though story sailing 85 days - staying two- sailing back would wild.  lmao Nobody said correct, China contained virus better US did. Regardless, US response terrible compared countries free well. keeps trying project failings onto young people. Florida needs better leadership doesnt way. afford pay everyone stay home. 1 trillion bail megacorps money keep mom pop restaurant alive. point Florida going find exactly many tests day max. watching ever increasing percent positive. 13.97% No. nothing male fragility. would absurd mandate masks FOREVER.  vaccine 2021, hopefully he's jail then. season make difference? Also, make blanket statement winter Florida looks like Summer New York? tickles brain. get idea looking official case numbers? really think accurate. Like many diseases, covid correlates strongly (in US everywhere else) poverty. official numbers often reflect well cant

i see doctors, get food, etc. People area mask wearers....so....fuck. Maryland ""association"" instead union, strong influence, thank goodness. Whoa 20% wild estimate... super low compared seen.

But point partial benefits correct. R 1.1 looks different R 0.9 time that's 20% immunity do. sources this? wanted say babies wear masks. Ideally they'd home another caregiver, stores. adding posted regarding ambulances. 
There different levels care I'll try keep simple. 
You 911 trucks transfer trucks. 911 IFT(transfers) typically 2 separate licenses. Typically, fire department ambulance licensed 911 IFT. Private ambulances may dedicated 911 trucks cities towns trucks may may licensed IFT. Depends work. worked private EMS company 911 dedicated trucks licensed transfers, 911 calls. companies 911 trucks registered separate Entity. Ex. ambulance company, Ambulance CO. USA 38 vehicles. 911 contract City XXXX. might actually registered Ambulance CO XXXX, registered 2 vehicles. Logos, uniforms employees across 40 trucks.  
With that, ambulance pool may smaller think, i'm make realize even smaller that.  
 - EMT level ambulance [lowest level] - cannot transport vented patients. 
 - AEMT level ambulance [intermediate level] - cannot transport vented patients.  
 - Paramedic level ambulance [high level] - transport ventilated patients. Paramedics transport Covid patients vent settings fall outside standard vent settings fall Critical Care. 
 - Critical Care ambulance [Highest level care] - Staff vary, combination Doctor, CCT Nurse, CCT Paramedic, Respiratory Therapist. states Critical Care transport services. Covid vent settings standard vent settings, patient proned, ARDS settings regular paramedic trained in. 
I paramedic. know, 3.6 roentgen bars restaurants open curbside pickup. one thing learned last month it‚Äôs indoor prolonged stays result spread.

Evidently 30,000 people isnt enough? I'm appalled. China says 'Hi!' agree. anything draw lessons videos kinda reassurance hey brain moral compass still working. live rural California amount morons fighting wearing mask staggering. minimum save lives, yet people throwing tantrum it. going really pre-k? think? Every studies go message. 100% post wrong, start finish, amazing. 

Zero evidence zinc, zero evidence giving early. Zero evidence ""low-dose"" 

Reported fucking stupid give advises based zero evidence. 

Unless POTUS course Lol. ""Anonymous insider Downing street"" means quote.

Also bet someone pre existing conditions dies, cause death would labeled instead covid. No! FDA issued emergency use authorization hydroxychloroquine COVID19?

Which I'm trusting rushed Trump vaccine. legitimate government, given enough time, enough eyeballs, enough peer review, *eventually* taking Covid vaccine. I'm pointing crazy skeptical first round trial vaccines.

Edit: clear. I'm calling anti-vaxxer all. vaccinated vaccinnate offspring let unvaccinated people home around same.

It‚Äôs called prepared dude. bought squat rack weight September last year years lifting commercial gyms

At time tired always wait rack, feeling pressured work quickly.

Now I'm like seriously unbelievably thankful. I'd gone insane locked without thing.

I bought exercise bike February 300 miles it, I'm huge cardio guy I've getting in.

My laws got free tv sent us, mounted wall there.

Set yoga mat downstairs.

Really lucked out, get full workout entertained.

I would like get double end bag least also probably heavy bag, I'll probably fairly soon since decently affordable.

The equipment really miss gym cable crossover. things get pricey space basement one ever find good deal.

But commented squat rack, 600lbs weights, bench, mat, $500 everything. good stuff, full power cage, super sturdy, weights well taken care of, bench sits mechanisms work well. thing felt needed come mirror. bought cheap one goodwill like $10.

Look Craigslist secondhand local sites. may take weeks right set pop does, jump quick. lifting plan continue foreseeable future 100% worth some. I've never consistent going gym home squat rack. There's excuse lift. Even I'm feeling well tired whatever go lift light. worry getting head cuz one's watching.

And I'm cheap guy, rare spring anything absolute necessity. 

Of course guess space could limiting factor too. 15th? That's funny way write 26th. They're called meat markets nothing. Florida habit making criminals governor senators (cough Scott) WoRsT FLu Since risk getting infected higher indoors, testing outdoors?

Right seems like US hospitals trying make numbers sound positive possible bad name, statement speak mean fair - still kick every single person comes work wearing mask. reason business fail, hours cut employment terminated. different country banning countries concept.

Banning people countries political economical benefits. see politician would ban countries hit hard keep population safe.

Wearing mask never comfortable fashionable. eventually everyone stop wearing them. facts life. Even virus lurking. fucking unhealthy wear mask, fucking asshole.

It worked well dumb America spread false info. 

It unknown launched campaigns - took months put together. several suspects...

It clear happened, happening, happen. Wake fuck up, America. played. NHL get coronavirus news reddit. non redditors get coronavirus news? don‚Äôt direct answer question. also Michigan gym sent email thought going open saying masks mandatory, group spin classes would resume. 

I don‚Äôt know you‚Äôve even spin class, it‚Äôs small room lot bikes people breathing really heavy. Common sense tells great idea. Why? last group spin class took back February guy talking friend. Friend asks ‚Äúman, feeling?‚Äù Man says fever week feeling better (it Saturday). 

You can‚Äôt count people make good choices. ""Might""? ""must""? That's irrelevant lol work earn living. 

I think mean ""willing get sick potentially kill vulnerable family members"" Yep. we're seeing days ago (the argument it'll late anything time looks bad) also lag death reports too. state goes back readjusts later dashboards. ""May help"". Lol.

Snake oil. agree first paragraph rest went rails. Everything direct result inaction government. people weren‚Äôt forced go back minimum wage benefit service industry jobs wouldn‚Äôt position. Sit restaurants bars open level infection have. shouldn‚Äôt opened without first proper protocols place. Nobody wants live state perpetual lockdown also nobody wants get little ‚Äúcough‚Äù eloquently put it. 

I‚Äôm blaming people forced go work. I‚Äôm blaming incompetent governments, ignorant selfish citizens, lack competent guidelines nobody enforcing them. long list reasons someone would need to. really can‚Äôt think one? it. friends gas mask attach filters to, love it. half face p100 feels way protected N95, always struggled N95 seal good enough not. survey also. 80%+ want kids back school. I‚Äôm % Probably blanket ban non-citizens. Doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs student work visa, despite inconveniences. Great novel, way. whole thing struggle. Everyone late game everyone's horrible job. 
That's why.  skeptic continued lockdowns, wondering people d$$m gloom panic mode think Covid going lead apocalypse like Stand going react real possibility vaccine might effective. going remain lockdown life? guarantee vaccine covid found.

But it‚Äôs likely not. Experts cure common cold.

There never reason make one. Correct? treatment common cold mutation many different viruses **strain requires different vaccine.**

Bolded part wrong, targeting viral structure inhibits strains specific virus. viral structure doesn‚Äôt change there‚Äôs issue, covid spike protein isn‚Äôt changing multiple strains covid.

Which act same, according scientists studing right? guarantee vaccine one strain covid effective strains.

Targeting spike protein crucial covid bind ACE2 receptors goal current vaccine development. solves problem. One idea, masked gloved employee walk line people waiting stamp hands social distancing wearing masks. Deny entry stamps. Would work bit. would build surge field hospitals, times war natural disaster. means beds tents stadiums convention centers throughout nation. worrying potential shortage things like medicine, IV bags oxygen tanks, well medical professionals. federal government point intervene help government totally incompetent don‚Äôt know happen. 

Again, let stress: necessarily going occur. worst possible scenario. reality likely someplace between. example, many people simply stay inside quarantine cases go back anyway see news scared they‚Äôll catching COVID. could also discover treatment options like remdesivir steroid recently improved outcomes severe patients. BEST thing would could find drug like Tamiflu could given prevent people hospitalization first place. I‚Äôm sure far along route however. believe they‚Äôre trying Avigan, Japanese antiviral pill showed promise. 

Im sure would impact rest society. don‚Äôt want sound scary, would likely cause complete chaos millions dead devastated economy. talking years rebuilding need sort New Deal-esque program rebuild society.

Let stress necessarily think get bad. isn‚Äôt Polio. Point taken üòÅ Both. teacher, watched mental health students really deteriorate online schooling. think better kids school. risk/reward evaluation, seems kids risk home due mental health, food insecurity, abuse school COVID. 

That said, risk staff entirely different. don‚Äôt think benefit staff outweighs risks, hope go back person temperature checks requiring masks minimize risks prepared switch online immediately set threshold community reached. Well 20% going time seem bit worse you. pity us.

Oh, bless heart, passed ""pity"" 2 years ago. also passed ""grab popcorn watch awe""-phase. ""they still there? wow, wow"" Seeing recoveries around world societies opening back depressing we're (U.S.) headed towards another huge shutdown country-wide, like together rest civilization. know dumbass country screwing fuck man. We're supposed world leader face country even *involved* crisis anymore. Like he's completely moved beyond it. Well sorta. petitioned Supreme Court strike healthcare 20 million people. guess that's related crisis. Lots people learn hard way. least he's spreading knowledge instead ignorance covid damn near impossible enforce rules patrons stubborn enough. That's bars closed police enforcing covid restrictions (they part publicly announced not). family member sick, want get professional care soon possible want stay home cared someone medical experience?

The fact latter led high number home infections Wuhan early days lack beds, general public, health care workers government found loophole, solved problem centralizing quarantine points chain transmission could broken, China made detours regard, illustrated fact half infections Wuhan New York home infections.

Hopefully, people solve problems imagination actual experience.

Although know impossible. tell right now, large amount crossover two groups. Anti-mask Anti-vax supported insane conspiracy theories like Bill Gates trying kill chunk worlds population vaccines. father(most family far behind) unfortunately one people indoctrinated cult mentality sadly I've experienced idiocies first hand. kids got go back school fall. 
Wear masks. Clean school. Check temps. vulnerable teachers sit semester can‚Äôt another lost semester school. put us far behind. 

Why tF countries reporting many less cases USA mind boggling. 
Get together. trust scientist, big pharma. Profits first name. wont even make medicine works can't make money. non profit. say Easter. one 2021 still might make deadline. 2022 sure. Yeah case Georgia. masks seen businesses, including employees. 300 million doses arrive bulk - take months necessarily 300 million doses deal once. 

I'm UK I'm really sure powers states regards presume state outbreak time approval given first. go vulnerable people first people likely come contact virus like HCWs teachers.

Remember time vaccine approved, around 50% (probably less vulnerable people given first) people need take outbreaks can't happen.

For UK, I've heard estimates Oxford take 3 months everyone needs get it. ""revolt"" lol. Words meaning anymore. Easy way get accurate reading population sociopaths. knew something wrong statement ‚ÄúEbola 50%‚Äù . reading comment, realized I'd happily sign phase III trial, nervous vaccine rolls out. thinks difference risk tolerance. worst, would expect like annual flu shot, it‚Äôs likely one done thing. disease doesn‚Äôt mutate fast. Germany tried something like 50s...don't worry shouldnt last lmfao said dont use cause doctors needed time didnt want people taking PPE everyone needed it.. anyone brain tell work. swear 8% people follow around. Lol. say this, working store. certainly not. put 12 signs up. 9 door. force people wear entering. Even kick many out. Like lung damage? Honestly, may one best places coronavirus policy US. state NYC close enough take shit seriously, far enough away huge outbreak like NYC did. Best worlds, I'd count blessings you. unless also sure nobody plane originating country uncontrolled virus (yes, people always take direct flights), still seems like pretty bad idea, imo. patient told going France September last night. said apparently 72 hours flight, need covid testing bring negative let go come in. surprise anyone who's oblivious. significant part FoxNews. US concerned health services general. know American lives Wuhan considering repatriation flight January, $3000, decided stay put felt China good job trying contain virus cost much. posted update last month said she‚Äôs glad stayed. able go life almost back normal. 

I used live country locked everything used military enforcement keep people home. required police permission motorways, similar China‚Äôs measures. They‚Äôre phase one reopening extremely well. wish still there, level precautions restrictions taken. US, little done, ‚Äúfreedom!‚Äù, we‚Äôre paying now. Wrong. Wear inner sleep geek lord. mean they're wearing correctly either. Cover nose, dammit. King County, WA

And considered fairly good mask wearing standards. I‚Äôd say 55% wearing consistently. Another 15% carry put forced to. 30% doesn‚Äôt give shit Actually, far self-sufficient

Literally nothing said supports argument. agree almost it, topic. ROFLMAO I‚Äôm Southwestern Virginia people wear masks. beginning mandate, wasn‚Äôt really enforced signs ignored. actual shutdown would still effective getting things control. Epidemiologists expecting pandemic exactly one potential causes offense think I'm staring doctor holding mom vice grip procedure. Fla. ‚Äì Duval County broke single-day record new coronavirus cases fifth day row, according numbers released Sunday state Department Health.    total 740 additional COVID-19 cases reported Sunday morning Duval County, bringing county‚Äôs caseload 5,588. county‚Äôs previous single-day record new cases -- 677 -- recorded Saturday. Atlas stones pretty specific. know bunch strongman competitors they're mostly following programs similar powerlifting training changes adapt specific competition. think without federal response, states worry hospital overload. might reverse freedoms see happening otherwise think states may go full Sweden. 

In professional opinion, think federal government simply mandated mask wearing lot could prevented economy wouldn‚Äôt tank. Yeah, brought morning daily call attending. Subacute care doesn‚Äôt really open beds needs dialysis well. Even get bed would 14-32 weeks til partially recovered kidneys never recover. 

So, we‚Äôve told prepare passing. kind medication makes slow? SAID need help people. even people mentally deficient know us shit job. suggest go back job getting hard slaps face dicks instead trying explain things people already know. going ""freedom"" death. Yeah wish someone really knows shit great explaining (like Dr. Seheult medcram.com) would deep dive cytokine storm phenomenon, T- B-cell phenomena we're seeing, case studies people illness / antibodies, etc... school district created options teachers. Yes, mutate strains that‚Äôs even debate. However different strains don‚Äôt inherently mean different vaccine needed. similar likely vaccine target something common them. use completely different analogy, don‚Äôt need know make, model, year car know drain gas won‚Äôt go, need know it‚Äôs gas, hybrid, electric. 30 years ago didn‚Äôt even need ask much, knowing car sufficient.

Right knowing SARS-CoV-2 enough create vaccine, different strains, still use mechanism attack cells, antibodies still destroy SARS-CoV-2 way regardless strain.

The isn‚Äôt true common cold viruses, cars, trains, hot air balloons. require VASTLY different angles attack, SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt likely soon.

Different strains small mutations. need different attack vector needs major mutation specifically part effects vaccine attacks it. likely large series minor mutations (think 100s) point add major one. isn‚Äôt 100s across 8 strains, one single branch ‚Äúfamily tree‚Äù. Imagine rolling 30,000-sided dice recording results roll, get 500 number long straight.

Ugh. could agree more. types people always benefit conscientious others. option, emotionally, accept that's ""how is"" angry time. I'm point hoping karma comes back next life, guess. 

C'est la vie. Simple. Fed executive orders live. pretend everything normal. Two restaurants closed tons employees customers got covid 19 threw fit social media. even management tried bury it. got hand made news. shut down.   point fact they'd hurting people I'd say let them. Darwin Awards epic scale. following protective measures lol  impair cognitive function, won‚Äôt lower IQ anything, bit memory issues. smart phone likely tracked company China. 

And forget credit cards tracing spending habits forgot mask home back went pick dinner day. felt like biggest ass ever like 4 adults walked without masks. HORRIFIED.

And there's ugly American tourists. people can't change ways visiting foreign country sure want change U.S.

Here think everything right. wonder pitty glee watching US reckoning years douche bro geopolitical stage China: ""30 new infections, must lock down""

USA: ""30,000 new infections, big deal!"" Might fella doesn‚Äôt know would wear mask restaurant, table, usually remove mask.  chance cat baby learned use reddit? seem struggling concept mirror. Seriously. ‚Äúnever same‚Äù crowd gets me. Yes personal experience tells opposite headline true. Less 7% actually wear mask. complain it. alert goes down, beaches given green light. Pubs days away, Leicester gets locked down. 2 metres goes 1 metre, medical advice . . . 

Okay that's consistent. change 2m 1m medical advice. 1m global advised number, 2m rather arbitrary. Leicester saw outbreak, localised level lockdown happen there. Localised containment measures plan while. 

There's inconsistency there. Pubs opening **as result** lower alert level. That's also put 2m down. local outbreak happens, responded to. mean, deluded you? Sorry, there's scenario government annoyed crowded beaches time saying ""people must follow advice"" makes sense

How warped see there's difference. think ""go beach stay distanced"" ""everyone pile beach dotn distance"" deliberately looking things there. we're 18 we're allowed drink, mean acceptable drink 2 bottles vodka day. totally mixed up, right now. Even dig it, fucked up, never mind get news Daily Mail BBC news 6.

And yet provided single mixed message government pushing right now. read DM print media available. again, getting information mirror Jezza's tweets throughout this, understandable there's mixed messages.

That reverse racism garbage fly anymore. 
Read memo. president brazil right? This. 3 year old ADHD 5 year old IEP requires supports school...And spent entire duties shutdown normalizing masks. I'm saying kids take quickly easily (and never will, especially medical issues disabilities.) let pick fun mask designs, make every trip wear mask adventure (that usually lead take treat would either wait eat got home would fine nice desserted area outside got ""picnic"" first, hammer home good associations. Masks cute, masks super heros. wear masks keep people safe keep safe. wear masks going around people can't stay far apart outside. wear masks go inside. touch masks they're on. wash masks get home. Lather, rinse, repeat.

We've tried lengthen outing lengths used masks 10 minute errand thing. want ready possibility fall.

Parents taking time normalize masks kids. 6 weeks school starts live now's time started already. Get used idea acclimate. Kids routines schedules make masks part that. hope parents going wait day person schooling starts (if does, even knows) toss last minute purchase mask kids. That's asking trouble. went effect today. get 80% figure already? Decisions made RNC, Inc DNC Services Corp. private companies behind scenes formally put effect session.

Even AZ gets super mad them, someone else pay plenty join.... exactly stop blowing whistle? Many already paid mortgages early 40s etc. 

The easier part target media, there's actual choking point possible government target. I'm one losers actually tries change want see. Cheers bud! Yeah, we're spike *then house slide street*? consuming toxin weakens immune system ... cheeky title OP. Good job. That‚Äôs good way honestly, professionals make decisions. Unfortunately look it, americans won‚Äôt pandemic control long time. really hope Canada something similar Europe, else cases would grow exponentially. starting less cases, wouldn‚Äôt want efforts go waste Canadians wanted escape cold! I'd rather move Europe want. 

Not though, United States mess 125,000 people dead. continue get sick, continue die.

I think speaks lot louder. Haven‚Äôt able confirm, heard year, CDC double counts causes deaths data won‚Äôt comparable years end. 

IE imagine heart attack car accident, initially would counted car accident death heart attack death, ‚Äúreal‚Äù cause death figured would counted one other, mid year counts would get double counted. 

If anyone confirm deny would much appreciated, haven‚Äôt able find out. Would also like know mid year pneumonia deaths looked like it‚Äôs difficult google stuff since brings back many things results. Florida wont stop. one making changes counter increase What‚Äôs heartbreaking irrationality time much misinformation going around one trusts anybody instead go politicians...which leads deaths heartbreak.

I wish people would listen. lockdown also valuable learn fairly quickly better treat ill without cure vaccine. chance dying covid get infected less March. late already died, Sweden 500 per million people.

Who ""they"" bad selfish ignoramuses refuse wear masks? that's society one starves death, I'm listening. ever say kids ever died it?! No. according CDC June 24 grand total 28 deaths age 15 US.

So, yeah, I‚Äôm calling bullshit persons claim 3 local children died recently it.

Facts don‚Äôt support narrative pretty tough guys handle. [My comment history literally telling people pessimistic prospects find comments making fun anti-vaccine movement go back far enough.

A good precaution would get everyone tested every week daily check ins screen symptoms.  There's actually novel ""[A Confederacy quite good. sad story author got published interesting too. Ahrewd sustainable trend, another 8,530 asymptomatic zoomers need hospitalization.  people Texas changed behavior recent days due rise cases? know things closed back down, going enough slow spread?

Second, there‚Äôs never time wait 5 10 years drug. imply every person different race systematically oppressed different kind racism. ""The soft bigotry low expectations""...

I'm denying disadvantages, ways reduce them. I'm NYC confirm issue, distinct minority. 

In experience 95% people stores wearing masks. 75% wearing masks street. Inside subway cars probably 90% wearing masks. Oh boy. still go Syria. 

America third world country. add protestors outside, good amount wearing masks distancing make sense Closed bars, pack restraunts drink. Way complicated many Americans... experience, love paycheck blows. depending passion income, becomes work. I'm wondering controlled infection possibility. mean give low dose virus otherwise healthy person followed antibody therapy. Monitor reaction, increase viral load bit followed another antibody therapy. Repeat cycle enough antibody built up. Give body time learn properly react virus. Neither over-reacting under-reacting virus. heard similar approach treat allergies. Give low dose allergen monitor reaction increase amount allergen slightly let body learn it. Instead get Bill Gates' daily thoughts. I‚Äôm Atlanta went store today. person wearing mask employees Publix. We‚Äôre trouble don‚Äôt wear masks public. go away hot weather?

It‚Äôs like people went back work think pass go hang bars work things Pre pandemic never considering amount people come contact daily work putting risk spread either way! less human contact better! Reddit no, real life yes. Mix terror, pity Trump say next. Baffling. Google ""mixed messaging + covid + uk"".

It's strange defending shit show country put up.

I think problem is, think messaging headlines affect country whole. possible give clear, stong messaging . . . There's none that.

The lower alert level exactly? Number 3 ""COVID general circulation"" . . . So, opening beaches obviously next move there.

It's mixed messaging mate. Every announcement made individuals Cabinet, every U-turn made, every bad policy every time say ""let's try see goes""

It's awful response. Every step way. expect people listening headlines establishment media get right? Frankly, can't expect media get right, except they're looking buzzwords headlines vested interest things opening course.  raised polite rude foreign me.

Hey that's thinking forward enough stock market like it. hand shorting market right it. China showing takes contain outbreaks virus, Americans refuse learn. agree this. Many Americans following simple suggestions like wearing mask without triggered infringing rights. hope bunch countries bar us traveling, we're huge risk others.  might get lucky get vaccine election cycle, might get unlucky another years Trump office. latter case, we'll surely get vaccine leaves. Sounds like need new friends. respect people acting recklessly pandemic. health would one thing, gamble peoples lives sick.

Well.... guess know right maybe can't.

No matter, battle away Reddit glory Party! that‚Äôs case either virus mutating outdoor transmission almost nonexistent.

""Mission Accomplished"", right Pence? wait see (more) right wrong ultimately. declare ""victory"" made lockdown/quarantine overly simplistic way look it. take years see ultimate effects situation, virological, also socioeconomical perspective.

One claim circle-jerk, maybe way is, would rather say fair stay optimistic, let optimism (circle-jerky not) cancel realistic point view. ‚ÄúSome time‚Äù defined ‚ÄúI wore once.‚Äú vague measure anything. rules social distancing store?

And said earlier post, totally heroic store refuses customers wearing masks, accepted store give shit social distancing.

All posts BLM, nobody commented people social distancing, everyone loosing shit people using masks not.

It's become psychological, almost religious. numbers show obsession masks working. question general American wake see something wrong. honestly doubt it. Sometimes wonder fucking big window. Seems enough data allow large gatherings they're held outdoors participants wear masks, regardless social distancing. privacy fears apply races, personally noticed spanish-speakers unwilling share information employers, probably they‚Äôre worried we‚Äôll call ICE them, need keep working won‚Äôt get paid (since don‚Äôt get unemployment stimulus check), know find they‚Äôre going work sick, we‚Äôll shut down. 

Half county‚Äôs cases spanish-only-speakers. don‚Äôt even come close making half total population. It‚Äôs racist point facts. reasons beyond control making things worse them. that's America. celebrities mores trustworthy actual physicians scientists.

I think misconception Midwest though come small cities reopened immediately packed bars. people did. Hospital yes. Deaths lag we'll see goes course recount good America done world. Try debating side achang3. Hahaha come up, I‚Äôve got couple spare rooms. True Psychology 101 folks. lie. took intro! say black people responsibility yet blaming *all* white people? C'mon, man. Yeah, Colombia‚Äôs President (btw, Columbia US state, Colombia country) widely criticized mostly everyone violating peace treaty FARC (very long fascinating story, revolutionary guerrilla movement officially declared peace couple years ago).

However, FARC soldiers persecuted murdered since current Pres came power, revolutionary sentiment repressed (pretty f*scist ask me).

Very sad see land brought us cocaine Shakira....... realised married Karen  Reopening safely, yes. happened. Instead, multiple states brink right behind them. why? What‚Äôs end game? euphoric fuck bro. seeing surges young populations around country last couple weeks great someone doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúopinions‚Äù follow groupthink doesn‚Äôt mean know thing me. I‚Äôll stop talking you‚Äôre clearly thinking rationally overall won‚Äôt stop.  Well, nearly 50% percent country voted trump, got mess. 
Also, heard anti mask people anywhere outside US yet.
Only what's responsible mean everyone country too. Yeah, you‚Äôre clearly someone handle difficult times life. joke. Like Florida /r/shitamericanssay suggesting cops walk around street without tear gas? dare you. */s* apparently might mistaken real opinion days. lol please excuse wasn‚Äôt clear. I‚Äôm NE. we‚Äôre actually paying attention scientists acting accordingly. huge riots protests~yes. Zero surge. Maybe uptick overall.. good. ?????????? many pandemics start china?

This saddens comrade. country like this. N.C. Department Health Human Services reported 1,605 new COVID-19 cases across state Sunday, bringing total 62,142.

The agency reported 1,322 people died, four day earlier.

The number reported state hospitalized COVID-19 increased two Sunday 890. Reporting hospitals fell 12 percentage points Sunday 78%.

So hospitals reporting? angel yourself, never posting lies propaganda. stopped posting much misinformation would people like back least Funny... saying ""silver star""...

Turns still ""also ran"", whether look total tests daily tests. yes. explained actually longer typical 5 14 day symptomatic period things start showing data various reasons including ones mention.

however seen large spike young people getting likely correlation since protesters young.  they're asleep wheel right write other. Trying another tack huh?
Just stop. sad.   full text agreement available right now, IIRC, Americans guaranteed access narrow corridor-- maybe 5 km side highway, plus couple exceptions north highway goes really isolated areas?

BC police could certainly become vigilant stopping American cars outside corridor. 

But really....as American, hate say this, lot countrymen behaving like spoiled toddlers right now. allowed overseas prove act like responsible adults again. 

So would fully support Canada including Alaska highway general ban border crossings. Maybe allow exceptions Americans willing jump hoops, like show proof testing quarantine cross border. 

Of course Trump administration would sue decision, Canadian government could easily keep issue tied court least six months. That's binding agreement ever saw one.

So, backsies. Basically, evidence suggest relatively low dose HCQ treatment along combination drugs like azithromycin zinc good impact.

But big catch treatment begin beginning someone's onset symptoms. makes job lot less useful general purposes people going see treatment symptoms bad. evidence far HCQ works case.

It could good modality though situations like nursing homes learn one infection, test everyone knowing likely spread history spread types environments. immediately begin low-dose HCQ treatment. might good circumstances happen cause lot deaths United States.

But people getting sick one day realize way sick battle home, HCQ going beÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº right treatment fact studies showing that. Cont. (hit max char Good chat. Thanks insight. knows answer though suspect never change though.

IMO ""an answer"" kind thing. live society together need involved determining acceptable rules operates. 

I'm still want discuss concepts :) number people think tenure makes teachers unfireable staggering. give general public virtual tour COVID ICU rooms hospitals. Things getting really scary right now. 

Take Arizona example: current situation hospitals... Reported. Ty. least engineering already done, extra wiring power outlets plug people hallways, HVAC cohort entire floors covid, etc. Im LA County despite record spike drove group Karens maskless Recall Newsom Petition Party.[Karen Petition important thing know know long-term effects COVID are, serious non-symptomatic infections. virus existed six months. Weird delete anti-Trump stuff pro-Trump Zero surge attribute protests. Cry more. You‚Äôre full shit. extended lie help matter.

For regular people: trust someone tells ""wear mask"" two months screamed ""stop buying mask, Yeah guy weirdest response I‚Äôve ever seen know opening Simpsons Maggie driving car pans back see Marge driving Maggie fake steering wheel make feel like driving?

Maggie's steering wheel popular vote

Marge's steering wheel electoral college see use r/sino! Good see comrades here! Obviously chance European citizens could get America governments allow it, charter flights citizens money utilize chartered flights.

However, aside cost, many governments months now. Many, many foreign citizens already escaped America. expectation probably foreign citizens wanted return would already done so, relatively left America. probably going far fewer chartered flights point result. citizens chose ride stay America past months may much harder time returning countries origin now. First love good conversation thank you. make valid points.

Same you, thanks reasonable even agree said much Im sure 30% would cover cost definitely closer accurate number still increase would factor non less some.

This always comes types conversations, really confuses me. Assuming sales remain (big assumption, know), increased revenue higher menu prices passed server percent sales? essentially situation except customer can't opt-out.

Like, servers currently okay low hourly rate plus average 20% tip, 30% increase menu prices provide enough revenue restaurant give servers higher base rate plus 10-15% sales? want increase actual amount money customer needs spend decrease amount money server earns. want change model distributing money raise floor employees, worry income variability *as disagree. long posted restaurant menu, deceitful auto-grat 8 tops higher. deceitful service fee delivery drivers pizza chains Administration service fee pay every month bill apartment. ""service fees"" lots different parts businesses.

IMO service fees deceitful practice people usually account stuck them. Again, say people responsible consider beforehand, seem play way reality.

The one I'd classify differently delivery fee, opt choose pick food rather delivered. allowed go restaurant say ""I'll tell kitchen order pick myself."" service required part customer, therefore included price. Totally agree thats lot. clarified servers would see increase hourly wage rather stay decreased rate pay tipped employees Im trying add cost restaurants. 

It's stance ""tipped minimum wage."" minimum wage minimum wage. know restaurants supposed make difference servers earn enough tips, adds complexity situation, provides opportunity exploitation since servers may want cause waves. Getting rid tipped wage (as places like washington state done) eliminates this. head thinking $1,000 sales 6 hour shift = $100+2.13/hourly pretty decent normal, decently busy night shift normal chain restaurant. 6 hour shift pretty common closing shift. 4-10 maybe another half hour closing duties. know happy OCharleys worked 4-5 nights week walked $100.

So agree earning $100-$120 6 hour shift still pretty solid pay. concerns much systemic problems pretty white lady consistently earn tips black guy providing quality service. well studied, tipping [objectively racist sexist 

Let's remove customer's opinion server, pay based revenue generated via earning fixed percent sales. server still incentivized upsell know portion upcharge going pocket. telling server makes $8.98 hourly tips?? Wow... thats really really good. also I'm sure cost living way higher KY.

That's correct, adjusted annually, rate go time. [This puts denver 21% expensive Louisville. cost living higher here, IMO earning fed minimum tipped wage $2.13 like robbery matter US. Easy answer yes, obviously point achieve thing Im sure buying public whole would view this. places advertise cheap easy. people want higher prices across board flat service fee? answered opinion discussing pizza chain service fee &amp; saw that.

I get able advertise low prices gets people door drives sales. direct counterpoint this. real challenge change cultural expectations agree public's *perception* cost one largest obstacles getting rid tipping culture. take time make transition achieved all. 

As stated above, stance pizza delivery fundamentally different restaurant service, yeah, even financials *would be* people continued make orders, perception price matters absolutely would affect people actually order. Also, places work want upsell. Sell top shelf drink, sell dessert, sell bottle wine versus glass, bucket beer versus one, add shrooms onions bacon burger, etc etc, service fee actually helps entice staff par menu, specials, etc... want come phone take 15% go home people always do, fine, know come really hustle push sell know see profit store also sees profit, win/win.

I totally agree! advocate percent sales (the servers individual sales, total restaurant sales) going server. rewarded selling more. think come menu price rather additional service fee. Going route (ignoring tipped wage part), 15% increase menu prices could solve this. would change $8 menu item $9.20, really big change Totally flat disagree comes kitchen staff. give ya busser, point see going either way. bussed, made decent hourly would usually get minimum tip servers. usually found servers want roll silverware charge $20 it. people hate rolling silverware, kitchen staff way get tips (again, exceptions rule, Mom&amp;Pop places, customer specifically asked tip kitchen, etc) But, I'm serving Im working money. Kitchen staff work different rate always get hourly usually decent pay. Also, worked kitchen 3-4 hours dinner service tons prep hour close filtering cooking oil, cleaning, prep tmrw whatever. never felt like deserved tip out. never deal guest. Again, opinion.

Yeah, think fundamentally different opinions here. see increased workload full dining room affecting everyone restaurant, think everyone rewarded. servers taking extra work alone, therefore receive benefits alone. Ha, unless kitchen staff prepared take pay cut days arent busy. give take. get easy Monday know going get whipped Friday. Hourly pay increase/decrease business hourly kitchen folks.

Again, resolved removing concept tipped minimum wage. Depending base pay percent sales received, would vary establishment, kitchen workers would prefer higher earning potential others would prefer consistent wage. details system matter general outline kitchen since already accustomed earning fixed hourly rate.

I tend look acceptable floor potential income busy days rather getting pay cut slow True degree also goes back thought bad employees weeded out. make $10/hr busser night fuck busy get stand walk get high (Ive personally never got stoned bussing,lol) OK making $10/ hr busy.

This idea total invalidates idea server works harder tips. suggests okay making min wage restaurant empty, okay earning min wage restaurant full. IMO that's totally common jobs. lady working counter UPS store make less depending whether 4 customers today 100.

This sounds like argument servers earn flat hourly rate salary receive tips/service fee busier times. rate high enough, think decent argument. could also argue UPS store pay employees busier shifts generated value working busy times. work, Chinese around support initiatives?

China exactly known free speech. Swede I'm well aware Gui Minhai. know are, worth thinking lot people dare speak actually think country cracks free speech way China does.

That said, leaving politics, obviously could seen unliberal enfore lockdowns way lot countries (not China) does, helped stifle spread.

And said initial comment, wrong - perspective vow human life even ethically praiseworthy - sham call victory rather necessary evil.

What effects lockdowns quarantines long term country/population remains seen. want people little bit realistic, call victory battle even ended.

Wear masks public.

It truly airborne, spreads water droplets air. 
Wearing cloth mask protects others preventing water droplets getting air. 
Once water droplets air, cloth masks good protecting weather, STILL PROTECT OTHERS YOU. 
Wash hands frequently, still spread contact. 
How sick get whether die depends viral load, much time spend near infected person much virus enters body, well medical conditions may have, known unknown. 
A lot still known lasting effects, likely kind lasting effects around 25%+ infected.

Have considered wrong this? reason lockdown taking long (and reason cases rising states open up) artificially elongated duration virus locking healthy young? maybe wrong put faith ""let's destroy economy wait vaccine instead letting young able-bodied (and whoever else wanted risk it) get herd immunity"" plan? 80 percent across Canada That's right United states Australia got job done make talk stay away wear one really stop reading bed :/ US fucking barbaric m8.

shall go on?

The US lot problems, terms testing mortality rates, quite well, better vast majority worlds 200+% countries. Yes, did... real name Christopher L. Kidwell. afraid post it. Another good reason fly delta. weird? They‚Äôre going charge receiver plasma money it, cant compensated life saving antibody plasma? 

Clinics pay sperm donations sought traits like higher average IQ  great education even average height. wouldnt compensate plasma could save lives?

It seems like reasonable question. Anti-bodies drastically 3 months. idea heard immunity work virus. bad since pollen allergies sneeze sneezing covid symptom. cold though. Trouble is, Florida probably LOOK like post-apocalyptic nightmare; streets empty except tumbleweeds swirling trash, fires burning control, shops looted picture windows smashed, corpses lie face-down pools blood, living envy dead. specific idea apocalypse looks like, sunny Miami Saturday ain't it. I'll bite. 

The biggest issue whole thing always healthcare capacity. next ""wave"" telling things play future. cases spike hospitalizations manage level deaths skyrocket, think good chance muddle way back type normal. things get lot complicated outbreak basically guarantees health care system collapses area every single time.

With regard question risk, important remember covid still new hard really know ""risking"" right now. months. gotten full picture long term side effects types things make person pre disposed getting ""severe"" form covid versus not. Obviously, elderly susceptible basically everything explain seemingly healthy 30-somethings died others walk around without symptoms.

Tldr; may take chaotic phase last forever. Ontario, it‚Äôs like 25% masks city best times. I‚Äôm freaking read much US news really wish people would wear masks. 

There Asian supermarket saw 2 people without masks try shop food can. gonna infect that? Cause think that's point....it's contagious. *any* masks photo???

""Dr. [Mark] Escott saying everybody get tested. We're going go back testing people symptomatic frankly enough testing capability tests coming back quickly enough,"" Adler said.

So blame whoever responsible supplying tests. cant citizens state see threat all. Since beaches important lives? first confirm case January? 10 million cases 6 months time? 

Holy fuck...for first time life, idea next 6 month going be. make much sense devil would want test someone's faith. Try get lots Vitamin D, rest exercise. Ask bernie Schwartz worked gyms malls open bit, month now. We're heading phase 3 4, 4 normal happening without vaccine. Theaters given greenlight current phase limited number guests.

Hoo boy read news? astonishes people can't draw parallels.

You right to... toilet house. Long ago, public health officials decided outhouses good. Flush toilets running water keep spreading disease. required houses flush toilets. can't flush toilet house US. get occupancy certificate. guess allowed live tent somewhere really want one.

Public health means, GENERAL, decided flush toilets, running water, mandated garbage service, vaccinations, important enough them. Seat belts, anyone? affect you, affects everyone around you. Superspreaders Typhoid Mary good example this. wear mask, make people sick.

Because think maybe Almost 2.4 million Americans tested positive coronavirus, according Center Systems Science Engineering Johns Hopkins University every one confirmed case, Redfield said, CDC estimates 10 people Redfield also said relatively low percentage Americans infected means hundreds millions remain risk

The key point - Maybe 20 million Americans immune, 300 million vulnerable.

Second wave material right there.

This around serology results countries btw. people infected, people still vulnerable. flew Delta yesterday gave us wipes got on, pre-packaged bags almonds, water, hand sanitizer flight instead drink service. everyone wore mask entire time (I sitting row kid keep on, adults seemed mostly taking seriously). Nice work Florida morons like people populated sub politicized issue middle election year used intimidate shame opposition. Fyi, wear mask. don‚Äôt give single shit Americans telling control freaks piss off. Also, still voting Trump. least 500.000, I'm fairly certain total much higher reality, took 6 months.

To put perspective, bloodiest battle human history battle somme 1916 lasted 5 months killed 700.000 million. whatever reason, we‚Äôve elected anti-intellectual sociopath continue listen ilk. fuck nuts protesting April cuz economy pawns. need ignore moronic assholes politicians promote this.

It'd hilarious, sad. like earthquakes fire codes everything else. Something people think 2 years back cheap ignored thereafter vaccination....until next time increase much lower rate case count increase. mention 20% positivity last peak, trending upward 5%... sounds like LOT surge due increased testing. all, LOT. Bolsonaro said earlier, virus Communist, made China make alt-right look bad (if true, China outstanding job).

So, Communists (everybody disagrees Trump commie) catch virus...



This post would humorous, Brazilians, British Americans suffering, funny, mate. Hmmm see you‚Äôre saying.

I don‚Äôt think anyone wanted virus spread exponentially, anyone expect new infections increase lockdowns lifted? highly contagious virus. 

New cases skewing sharply toward younger, healthier people far lower mortality rates shorter hospital stays, isn‚Äôt best case scenario? seems though vulnerable taking heightened precautions. Younger people *materially* less vulnerable virus, deaths remain mostly constant another week two, shouldn‚Äôt dial back panic? 

Note I‚Äòm keenly aware hospitalization mortality numbers age comorbidity won‚Äôt moved anecdotal story two. Yes, limiting spread among young also protects vulnerable, aiming 0 spread irrational impossible. Plenty young/healthy people live alone never directly interact vulnerable populations. Locking *all* *all* time carries huge unnecessary costs probably aren‚Äôt sustainable anyway. we‚Äôre effectively protecting vulnerable populations (eg nursing homes), sure hope much better situation. guess we‚Äôll see situation evolves.

There‚Äôs doubt people wear masks socially distance better been. stories new *spike* cases beginning look lonely without overrun hospitals (granted many much tighter now) cascading deaths. it‚Äôs nearly 3 weeks since uptick cases. let‚Äôs see things evolve. 

Ok running cover don‚Äôt burn pls Probably much 50% answer would say starting maybe 30 40 years ago. Everyone, traditional sides political spectrum hyper concerned rights. gotten point nature rights actually forgotten. People also forgotten side rights, responsibility, letter alluding believe. Everytime sort social political movement, always rights, never responsibility. Really though, rights requested actually rights, privileges conveniences. AA needs go, bailouts Google/Apple Bluetooth contact tracing app's public use US? U fuckin libtards hilarious... go vote rapist child sniffer joe pay taxes.. lol oh wait yall prob dont even income yall care conspiracy still agree Unfortunately, chain strong it‚Äôs weakest link. sucks hard find place live without assholes dragging down. Yikes need see side story

Peoples lives ruined...and sit watch media suck protestors say cant go lowes. point nobody gives shit anymore I'm lucky good administration. 

But even blame bad adminstration state mandate it. need coordination consistency, endless parade parents yapping kids friends schools wear masks anyway state said *optional.* did. What‚Äôs crazy masks proven reduce spread 70%. everyone started wearing masks US initial lockdown, would much much different place.

Instead, sit stay home order, Houston. expect many cities follow US. time, hope mandate masks lift orders. not, stay home orders 3 months so. 

The formula get ahead virus shown us - ignore it, making matters economy worse.

Watch happens many people Houston next couple months don‚Äôt money, can‚Äôt pay rent, buy food. 

This disaster could avoided. opened fast opened many businesses. going get ugly fast here... already readying respite, seeing videos, posts folks Houston. still good 2-3 weeks surge... people follow orders.

Here‚Äôs shocker: not. People county stay home orders driving surrounding counties go stores, restaurants, parks, etc. It‚Äôs nightmare real life. But... is. Someday people learn. it‚Äôs thanks Rupert Murdoch rise ring wing propagand..er....media infected march 18th, still residual symptoms now, give idea. 

So easily go multiple months lingering effects  supposed predict going get bailed out? terrifies me. Bronchitis turned Pneumonia 13. 12 years later still suffer Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) caused it. I'd never wish anyone. ruined life COVID supposed worse.

I'm one luckier CFS patients, live semi-independent life (although still housebound occasionally need assistance parents). I'd never wish anyone fact could drive totally incapable walking WORSE family could cursed this... pumpkin stick charge fight another shutdown hard I'm sure. idiots wearing face masks prime voters. elections coming soon I'm sure decisions based rather countries best interest actor Nick Cordero leg amputated?  That's terrifying. I'm sorry hear that.

I got/had shingles 22, luckily fine now. idea could much worse. don‚Äôt make rules, go Chad ;)  Working whole time, period saw noticeably increased rips 2~ weeks people got $1200 cool also kind depressing. people triangle. They're rural areas lot idiots. think never India. Thank president that. I'm quite sure ppl understand 40% ppl nursing homes dying this.

Sorry lost PC mention protests? Sickening emotion pull fact. 80% majority got math Yeah, there‚Äôs much that. People talking whole family got sick Halloween makes much sense COVID never sick! lot literal patient 0‚Äôs there. Testing places like China Australia waste resources, considering positive case per test results. Yeah annoying hell. sounds like stutter sometimes I'm trying fight brain form word correctly haha. psychiatrist stuff relating teen never really offered help either. read ""bars"" verb instead noun concerned, confused read article üòÇüòÖ Man that's crazy.  Hope recover sometime soon N95‚Äôs direct patient contact COVID positive. Surgical non Covid. Surprisingly, ton disposable face shields way better wipe goggles/glasses. countries instituted masks much better reducing transmissions even studies confirm them? need get head sand look Lol. Guidelines system doesn‚Äôt expect Reading gave justice boner way home long day work, decided go bar grab food real quick. Pulled parking lot PACKED. pulled went home. get home see this. love 30 min Lansing Yes.  can‚Äôt lie doctor ‚Äúnoble‚Äù causes political manipulation. 

You need follow thing liked say like data/science + common sense. 

He gave full throated rejection wearing mask quite time. lot people don‚Äôt wear masks? Insane confusion back forth politicians fauci.  

After it‚Äôs spread degrees, wearing mask much less effective now. 14 years industry. Everything busser FOH manager. Ive said years places add 15% service fee every check. move towards true sense tipping OK want expected. know, someone gives fantastic service want tip, awesome. thats ok well employees still decently paid. 

Restaurants still operate make profit. Severs still hustle, gives incentive personally sell steak, extra side, dessert, dinner coffee, top shelf liquor. is, guest gets awful service likely pay bill anyway probably tip is. think eliminates whole stigma around tipping, much tip server good type thing. bad servers weeded out. 

Now said understood guest way Management ownership must servers back now. shall - paying service fee-. part bill. Failure pay whole bill shall seen reported theft. go hustle sell $1,000 worth expect money owed $85 people want pay service fee. 

An area see happened pizza delivery. least think... could wrong back day order $10 pizza price (plus tax) back 2000's gas prices soared pizza delivery chains keep drivers spend $4-$5 gas actually make money, pizza places started adding service fee states tip fee help insure pay staff tips welcomed. Makes sense never complained overtime start decrease tip pizza guy 20%-25% (I'm industry, karma) 10% dont feel bad know guy also probably makes $9-$10-$11/ hr. 
Win/Win situation, got decent pizza quality price everyone gets paid (looking Dominos)

But, change maybe Covid &amp; Karen's push change. Also, Great band name, Covid &amp; Karen's! I'm stoned! world get screened medical conditions pre-employment check? Yeah. doctors nurses get sick die doesn‚Äôt matter many hospital beds have, you‚Äôre screwed. Fully agree. somebody one point suffered pretty bad anxiety, think majority population isn‚Äôt remotely aware real anxiety symptoms feel (shortness breath, chest tightness particular). pandemic extremely stressful time many think lot people simply suffering anxiety panic attacks thinking it‚Äôs COVID-related. I'm Ontario currently that's exactly rule, eat restaurants/bars outdoor patios can't eat inside. I‚Äôve debating moving San Antonio Virginia, guess Virgins wins! man ever heard condom? LA County needs closed again. records exist, state accessing another. see sort constitutional/breach privacy case arising accessing citizen's location data/travel itinerary. soon rise again? One truism COVID - one family member household gets it, everyone does. Yeah read Miami become cultural thing Latinx's wear masks. wear mask anytime I'm indoors ANYONE household. yes, includes visit parents, siblings etc. (I know asked things besides mask wearing feel like lot people probably still wear around family live really should).

I trained wash hands religiously several times day, especially coming back running errands always eat.

My partner get takeout support local businesses times week eat inside restaurant.

I worry mail much. ""disinfect"" grocceries. simply enough lysol wipes go around live.

Other pretty much carry normal. future reference, obviously joke, Attempting pose federal agent kind still crime. DOJ seal card labels legal document. fake, still illegal. i.e. never kind HEPA air filters? need look that. Working food industry worst experience life. Upscale fine dining, high end cocktails, executive chef making killer food. masks, temperature taken nearly building walk into, mandatory quarantine arrivals), contact tracing apps, social distancing laws till June 7 (when really truly control, people getting tired wanting mah rights) Mexico allowing US citizens in? Can't hide hospitalization usage stats.

""If put people hospital bed, going use bed. said people, 'slow putting people hospitals.'"" watched videos anti maskers there. Yeah work makes us wear masks time too. Oddly enough initial reason skeptical cloth facemasks went training n95 respirators know first-hand cloth masks pass fit test. co-workers who've done fit testing respirators also think cloth masks nothing. Trump R's failed terribly managing pandemic, chance winning november convince enough people Covid either real big deal. order convince people big deal, things pandemic later say ""see got rid ACA everything fine! DemoRats making big deal nothing destroyed beautiful economy hurt me!""

These things normally pandemic destroy health infastructure. Unfortunately Donnie Dipshits taking gamble tactics make covid worse... already started happening (cases spiking) announced attempt get rid ACA.

Mr. Bones I'd really like get wild ride please thank got sick flu/pneumonia 11th grade. Went antiobiotics/prednisone. ruined life. Extreme stomach pain taking meds, point onwards, severe gas attacks every single day.

Interesting... allergies cleared up, dramatically, since working home. run HEPA air filters house, essentially allergens inside. Now, histamine reaction, usually figure causing it.

It also helps use N95 mask go public places.  good mask keeps viruses, also pollen perfume. preventing allergy attacks, chance detecting early stage infection. ""The best case, set Gupta, currently borne scientific data ‚Äì insists important consideration counterbalance.""

Well, insists. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming clear lot people exposed virus death rate people 65 something would lock economy for,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt think vulnerable disease. think vulnerable lockdown too. costs lockdown high point.‚Äù

Gupta one scientists epidemic made household name. 26 March, day lockdown came effect, intervened research made instant headlines. team Oxford used simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model produce best-case scenario outbreak counterpoint government‚Äôs worst-case scenario. No. Obviously not. lose less. Which, way, worse. scientists doctors warned us would happen take benadryl almost every night along hydrocortisone get severe itching. However, I'm faring better most. is, nothing it. believe caught disease early February, long widely known. SA drove three Northside hospitals tonight. dead parking lots empty ER's.

That said, ones went 'Covid' hospitals patients getting rerouted also elective procedures cancelled. 

It seems like calm storm see Covid truthers might call bullshit first glance. almost died pneumonia 2 years old life support month. I‚Äôm 29 never able keep peers lung heart damage, asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, etc I‚Äôve lived entire life. sucks. don‚Äôt even know ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feels like. also depression panic disorder wonder they‚Äôre connected life support. treatments? God forbid someone lost money. Better spread deadly pathogen business lose money.  God damn it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. heard? Protesting police violence means affect you. exactly last post tons posts arguing definitely spread via protests.

There likely transmissions enough root cause huge spikes. meant staying home, people legitimately cannot stay home jobs. also major concern waitresses cooks, livelihoods depend stuff open. sucks US works, much right right now. heard American Exceptionalism? would rather support artist etsy makes goods actually use. Amazon drop shipper scheme schemes. real business pretends one. Sorry, thought said ‚Äúriots.‚Äù must posted wrong link. Could post link actual riot?

And WTF website about? It‚Äôs hysterical. ‚ÄúPredict stock market.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow buy precious metals.‚Äù ‚ÄúWill fiat money survive 2025.‚Äù Yikes. Yeah, true, bad things hand. writing wall concerning virus early on. plenty time nip bud (other countries have). Instead, evil people, politics played thing raging control. 

Sometimes God removes hand let us wish. consequences non-compliance?

They‚Äôre regularly visiting construction sites check compliance shutting non-compliant job sites fining individuals wearing mask $1000 employers $1000 per onsite worker. It‚Äôs really suspicious something gets instantly gilded Also Florida: DisneyWorld opens business! It‚Äôs pretty solidly disproven can‚Äôt catch walking someone thinking touch one much average American population suggest something ridiculous! like putting piece scotch tape bullet wound subreddit. Yeah there‚Äôs selection bias involved people congregate forum share long-lasting debilitating symptoms are.

I live NYC know one person actually died COVID. know lot people 30s 40s it, even people aren‚Äôt best health, breakdown always ‚ÄúIt like sickest I‚Äôve ever been, felt fine two weeks.‚Äù

I doubt percentage people recover long-term complications, studied, way knowing common is. hear worst cases. 6 kids deep... going work holiday plenty planes moving around since Feb/March, world. also frequent travel forums, people still posting numerous recent flights. would expected hear plenty stories covid outbreaks traced back planes. yet - nothing.

It's weird. ""Current politics proves false"", ""There active participants progress"", ""I've done work make lives better millions""

Name single human sincerely focused making world worst. ""a world like less"", actually worse. yard stick even using?

Ok, off-topic little rude, brought up: I'm gonna bet understand first think entropy transitions states, that's inaccurate cringe use word I've ever seen. ""entropy arguments"", we're discussing done progress. Let's focus substance rather semantics tactics. alone makes think &lt; 25.

Rather staying abstract arguing progress means it, give example done pick apart? I'm starting think ran anti-Trump voting drive something feel-good otherwise totally transient like that. work done make life better millions? Especially given many people lost sources income. I've given plasma make ends meet before. thought this. It‚Äôs long since donated last due anemia. That‚Äôs control need go back. automatically test antibodies ask it? sharing information US among world leaders testing.

People like seem think lagging.... simply true. Answer please - can‚Äôt ever join military you‚Äôve positive test? Slovakia Trump knows N95 is... even know 19 COVID-19 is. Grifters care quality. Trump would promise red MAGA masks send people fruit rollup gummy worm, idiot-sheep would still think great. ""He's literally trying kill us, we're literally buying it, get joke, libs!"" kudos back patting. hasn‚Äôt happened far earlier? concept typical liberal ideology ascribe fault one person. ideological basis ‚Äúboot straps‚Äù ‚Äújust don‚Äôt drugs‚Äù Yes, wrong. Seems dire headline would us believe still concerning. state availability might 20-something percent, would imagine densely populated metro areas would overwhelmed soon. happens, patients transported hospitals still ICU capacity, possibly areas COVID taken root yet.

There lot possible containment breach routes transporting COVID+ patients. I'd bet will. Oh yeah. Like, time. old news. know are, would rather risk getting lol. currently florida, we're low air quality warning massive dust cloud, kinda irritates skin. man Florida argue talking Covid isn‚Äôt real. checked back response. can‚Äôt blame government time. Americans choice stay home, noooooo motherfuckers want party like rockstars pandemic. house, working home, working home, playing video games didn‚Äôt time play. It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs also hard put damn mask. Guy *bow*, guy *wear a* *mask*. wish people protest magnitude one hundreds times shit happened. It‚Äôs just... one sparks big movement? couldn‚Äôt Trayvon last straw? hundreds him?

Was timing all? quarantine got people antsy get out? president? ton things combined? 

It‚Äôs sad people finally backs broken straw pandemic things. informed public upholds duty protect community, need government firmly grasp hand like toddler run straight traffic moment guardian lets go. Yep. AG private army never revealed names service branch member press. yes, military branding many Armour shirts gear probably got minutes ago. guarantee cure vaccine ever found, logic restaurants also opened say good bye traveling. limit capacities bars 30% implement social distancing like countries. That‚Äôs 10 times flu mortality age band

Hospitals fast it‚Äôs staff short.  suggests God punishing committing sinful acts parties whilst sparing protesting peace. *can't China Third World country.

Geopolitically, Cold War era labels:

* ""First World"" NATO bloc
* ""Second World"" Soviet bloc
* ""Third World"" everybody else, China Switzerland, along much Africa.

""Zeroth World"" never defined, catchy label! alone, although know someone thinks "" they"" "" reseeding"" virus, death rate expected Dr. Fauci 2012 experiments time. second wave 1918 flu devastating. first wave killed vulnerable elderly. Things went really bad October second wave care age vulnerability. lot places also third even fourth wave. flight today DFW PACKED üò≠ family friend current major motor function brain damage due coma ventilator. COVID seriously joke even survive.  family article yesterday 18 members sick. thought first family people come covid... noooo, another huge family working kill one another.

It's sad. get fuck attitude. selfish cunt. Social distance wear fucking mask. 

I hope, hope, hope, get affected pandemic. understand. 

Fuck you. I'm DFW. coworker said take virus Bill Gates cus trackers it.

That's we're working here... Essentially meaningless figures. There's doubt reality, millions already died disease.  passenger refuses comply flight crew BIG deal police absolutely waiting landing. I‚Äôm betting powerful fart cannon. I'm beginning think scarier promoted death dying disease. saying ""if get oh well"" think they'll catch recover, even think aftermath consider entire future health could severely impacted. attend party dinner friends. Lol. Yeah crazy people need make living amiright God wish would. They‚Äôve opportunity chosen to. They‚Äôre really moving forward thing won‚Äôt change way they‚Äôre it. :( read article, made clear simply asking established crisis standards ""activated"", is, formally authorized. gives liability protection health care providers.

The article goes state health care providers already operating crisis standards due hospital load. They'd like formal authorization. What? Armour? Like...the clothing brand? Let try again, used p word comment got removed. 

As said, sides guilty, wish sides (even one worst offender) would treat pandemic issues need overcome, opposed something bicker one about. 

Just seems silly criticize every large get together, turn blind eye towards agree with. steady first growing exponentially. Ah, 

I'm camp psoriasis (and Crohn's, have) immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, autoimmune think discussion another subreddit two ;) people would done anyway, protests not. 

The argument ""protests kept people home"" without measurable evidence argument bad faith. Priced think permanent end result lockdown would be? could right thing rearrange exam 15 people bldg, even means 100 events. Um, restaurant? clue Andrew Gillum. Googled saw photo. Looks like could him. didn‚Äôt make big news? partially true. tests strict conditions beginning. doctors order tests.

Yes, day Olympics called government started telling people big deal.

I think things make original comment true. People wearing masks cautious even government told to. people Japan allergies.

No joke! HAPPY sacrifice greater good tribe.

I'll wait HAPPY sacrifice greater good tribe.

Cooperation delusion. Humans honeybees ants. Well, kinda since Reagan era, really want know.

*~ Old Guy, lived all* hear people say ""absolutely can't breathe"" mask almost immediately wonder poorly breathing cloth end CoVid gave viral meningitis 4 months?

I'd like real name please confirm this, something sounds iffy even believes coronavirus serious even fatal unlucky elderly (over 65) person.

I doubt 'extended illnesses' actually CoVid. mother's Death Certificate said ""Dead complications due CoVid-19!"" actually cytokine storm multiple organ failure due CoVid killed her.

Covid-19 epidemic poses challenge levels built environment.

The study aims imagine antivirus-built environment looks stop virus spreading, many architecture urban approaches may increase protection built environment.

‚Ä¢

There many questions raised current pandemic, hope search answers learn forced experiment add security layers overcome future virus like-attacks. Well would youth want stop covid? elders keep cutting funding humanity...let elders peace deserve. I‚Äôm one! saw apparently game became popular can‚Äôt even touch right now. feels creepy. cant genuinely heartbreaking infuriating. hate fact actually used believe country would rally unite face extreme tragedy... we'd try could lessen burden other.

This much. I'm sorry grandparents. mom similar. ill lung problems gets this, gone. inside since February wants go enjoy much life can. think people would try help times. Nope! People selfish. siblings call people wear masks stupid, yet go state come back without quarantining themselves, another friends come play games. infuriating. fucking suck up, deal uncomfortable beat this! really infuriating. People give shit unless someone know affected even still may selfish ever want. Come on, NPR, gatherings general... he‚Äôs protests would cause spike too.. 'spiking again' happens next nothing. Spiking 'again' happen year two. Sounds like anxiety honest. read heat sensitivity chronic fatigue due damage autonomic nervous system. Mine damaged genetic issue (connective tissue disorder) I‚Äôm living fear contracting covid. Damage autonomic nervous known happen survivors. Fingers crossed spared that... hope funding terrible neglected area medicine finally materialize issues going become WAY common population. I‚Äôm ‚Äúmisery loves company‚Äù type person. looking silver lining barricaded house. Canadian, eh? Tell bullshit. whole thing bullshit. either spreads large groups doesn‚Äôt. doesn‚Äôt pick choose unless numbers false! Wow really thanks information, it‚Äôs almost like poor America means don‚Äôt get quality affordable health care. Imagine that. Eat rich! must suck coloured Texas, whole website white people That's lot words say, ""MAskS WoRK! MuH libERtieS!"" Um favorite wrestler wore mask, name Rey Misterio Jr. beast viruses like that. Actually, aren't, I‚Äôm sorry know. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúreal thing‚Äù way. it‚Äôs contagious it‚Äôs supposed be, one know many people none people know anyone has. hope uncle gets well soon. might want try math again. would mean 100 million - 40 million cases guess. Sit butt watch tv. tried still child. matter deep woods parents took her, always found way back. Like mandatory charge self check perhaps? Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge Hornby Street many lives could saved everyone wore masks beginning

Don't forget even available months America back order. US option like Japan did. Lol took break doomers awhile decided needed laughs. dead like 4 months ago? happen became focused rights?

Fucking wot? Since obligations fellow man woman

Its selfish 80 IQ troglodytes problem wearing masks Same, asked go bar tonight group friends, said no. gonna stay in, order delicious food watch TV whatever else feel like. worth me. Really? Florida Arizona certainly running America's Next Top Model cancelled AA flight next Monday. Travel TX FL, FUBAR states right now.

Now, get wrong,I scared anyone forced travel air. However, research did, research paper find, chance transmission commercial aircraft 2 hour flight low. masks, cleaning, careful planning, evidence far say safe.

Yes Delta reserving middle seat, September, 6ft distancing still possible. really much better AA/UA.

I hope things gets better August. least seems Greg Abort Ron DeShitans brain left. Guess I'm moving Jefferson County. Good they‚Äôre providing unfortunate they‚Äôre enforcing. REI model would work well here. Go lick doorknob public building report back 2 weeks tell us really feel ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs prank bro‚Äù hell idiots get office... eloquently stated part part society making sacrifices help fellow neighbour, fellow citizen, fellow countryman. people think important privileges, yes privileges, important willing others die. Others ask sacrificed. Others could saved wearing additional article clothing. even one constrains them. Yet, people privileged care neighbours, colleagues, countrymen. yeah that‚Äôs NYC continues lower numbers... Give two weeks Five days. he's quarantined room dad?!? he's worried HE'S going die.  like, 'Dad, think I'm going make it,'"" Garay told CBS Los Angeles. ""That last thing told father, last thing dad saw son suffocating.""

Of course last thing saw. Dad got struggle breathe hospital 2 weeks. cheers, time mum let know much want freak out, i'm sort glad that. i'd known know would petrified ))

on positive side i'd say learn walk living pain months made stronger person mentally, that's good thing :) Lack healthcare makes seek coronavirus? point trying make? love salt. Take good pork. 

Let sprinkle College fucken scam. Karen scream things like,""60 FEET!"", ""WHERE'S MASK PIG?"" ""I DEMAND PERFECT DISTANCING!""

But sure someone get punched. Stop doom glooming. death rate extremely low everyone except elderly people already risk might make sense like submarine parts hospital. Place want spend lot effort reduce spread bit. Nah, they'll give schools legal immunity way theyn nursing homes early on. I've problem automod before, there's one link flags political every time post couple letters URL. check mod logs sub wiki. figure letters flagged (in case letters ""qr"" respectively) try reposting letters removed. ‚Äúno shit‚Äù literally every semi-intelligent person planet people scream Constitution seem know little it.

[1] like wondering...it's Kroger-owned grocery chain SouthEast.

www.harristeeter.com/about-us see contradiction. protesters fact contract virus thus contributing case count (however little since outdoor transmission magnitudes lower indoor). net effect protests actually reduction spread since almost everyone protesting stayed home. 

Now people back going restaurants, bars, gyms, etc spread accelerating again. Rugged individualism. 

Apparently means get die scared alone. poor thing Inadequate science education...  Correct, measured cases lower actual due lack testing. NY likely 20k cases day testing capacity greatly expanded numbers higher now. There's nothing wrong going beach wearing masks social distancing.

Guys can't blindly demonize everybody goes outside. responsible ways try maintain normal ish life crisis instead total hermit see sun next 6 months. problem dipshits crammed inside bars, restaurants, stores masks. problem God good lord give take away. praise good stuff happens also praise bad stuff happens. Near West Covina. know certain parts responsible others maybe baddies stick see way many people incredibly inconsiderate numbers prove it. donkeys ""wearing"" mask nose seems norm grocery stores. [They don‚Äôt care Bible says country issuing tests FAR confirmed cases, FAR. 

I surprised. might spared they're outdoors.

Plus, seem outbreak thousands anti-lockdown protesters social distancing wearing masks months ago. seem considerate empathetic. world needs people like it. wanted share know someone told awhile. Downtown Chicago madhouse packed cars restaurants. data NYC 6300 ADHD trip words man think linked. also structure sentences completely wrong way apparent reason. Almost like brain working fast like know I'm saying I'm saying it. sweat element dude think common ADHD etc dumbest generation told word retarded used

Shmoopylufigans

What name, snowflake Red cross app.  hodgepodge many different services including prison, border, ICE, army, national guard, police definitely unmarked unidentified somethings. ever get true investigation it, think people think entire affair unconstitutional many different ways history judge incredibly poorly, best. Illinois better strict dont wanna get laid app? OK Karen work, customers supposed wear mask come seated served drink. supposed wear one get go restroom (not dining area) outdoors smoke followed nearly much. first one though, good luck getting without mask. real statement existence

Thats bit much Seriously, WW2 would protest rationing? wear mask let's get with. Pretend soldier putting helmet virus war. covid (today day 22 sick) tests came back negative (My mother came back negative even though lost sense taste, reason believe testing site/lab shoddy/incompetent). weeks I'd like get antibody test. live Santa Barbara County California. find reputable accurate testing facility? I'm willing go LA. Masks metal strip bridges nose fixes problem. What‚Äôs beef New York‚Äôs data? also applies one. know things bleak, try lose hope. Really try best stay safe. me, may leave job. I'm 100% decided yet. people work take seriously. us wear masks, store often gets extremely crowded. 

I know people like hear this, I'll pray family, mean that. find hope Lord, care happens people. makes sense many died. article: ""When asked specifically protests, director L.A. county health department, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, repeatedly said feels spike correlates closely general reopening people getting going back work."" Short answer: enough people wearing masks.

You‚Äôre welcome. gave blood Friday thermal head scan tongue. like fans seemed like virus could spread more, staff practicing social distancing cleaning quite bit. Wearing masks Japan already common place. Even COVID, soon anybody sniffle put mask on. great point evolving situation, point trust authority, even perfect: tell masks work, wash hands, estimate infection counts, IFRs, CFRs.

We see happens everyone starts thinking know better. VA isn‚Äôt known efficient effective health care system.  want fall stairs break neck get hit bus crossing street. shit happens to. suggesting rando. Stop living? even mentioned things around always been. saying rando. stop living life full risks? max measured cases NY cases definitely higher, closer 11k/day. virus incubation period 1-2 reason US seeing surges cases right now.

Apparently, spot on.

But facts asserted still stand. Social distancing still advised I'm practicing it, President still can't grasp basic logical concepts. Intermittent, I've better many times, I've lost count lol. get pain days though, feels like I've 'pulled' lungs. I'd say culture makes difference well. offspring necessarily ilk, person's comment proves. Technically correct, scale? mean filter air coming peoples mouths directly source, like kind face covering.......... like respirator ...... mas.... seeing barely get people wear one, yet alone correctly. People die somewhere week 2 months infection... almost 1 million new confirmed cases last week. Things going get way worse get better. realize 4.5k sick coronavirus patients put nursing homes, right? know 60% range right? don‚Äôt exact numbers, know speaking counties contributor. course difficult tease exactly time, people going protests, also seeing increased movement reasons,‚Äù Angell said news conference. type 1 diabetic 5 months diagnosed got flu always suspected that's triggered it. least idea triggered true. know little them. exactly how. *our* fault stopped social distancing set bad example. Maybe get better leadership stop looking people whose lifestyles deride set standard them? makes sense people stopped wearing masks south BLM protests. Take responsibility. brain hurts trying understand this. failed elders badly. took one month delay central government kicked overdrive. US‚Äôs UK‚Äôs lack policy implementation 6 months heinous. understand. Whitmer caved?

I thought Michigan well too. first link yahoo reprint national review best source use primary evidence. article CNN didn‚Äôt mention it. I‚Äôve literally never seen anyone suggest young people equally likely get serious complications. sure you‚Äôre getting info Okay, industry work in? think properly following procedure little important workplace yours. Sorry, limit broadcasting ability limited silly internet boards. third retirement announcement something?  Japanese wearing masks years. It‚Äôs nothing new them. guess big question whether neurological symptoms directly caused illnss, secondary symptom caused primary symptoms.

I COVID, I've pretty sick pre-COVID definitely confused, tired, irritable, etc. 

Being sick ass-whooping body getting beat up, best cognitive abilities. think there's similar percentage decrease learning distance learning reasons. seem good solution case. Canadian American passport. say moved Corona began. missing point.

In late March, reliable dataset S/Korea CFR 1.5% so. (It went since then). Instead used CFR Germany still early stages fatality numbers __lagging__ severely. 

When Germany numbers deteriorated picked another country IIRC.

And never said anything death delayed indicator (which already well known point) mention uncertainty case counts... No, going poverty desperation that's going sort out, that's sad fuck. Darwin element part it, lot smart/cautious poor store workers/janitors/waitresses/ teachers families going pay huge price deserve it. frustrated. gave blood ten days ago.

Better paying 150 bucks. make sure quarantine 14 days get tested 5 20 days. Damn, sorry hear that. can‚Äôt imagine must like. industry creates unique relationships that‚Äôs sure. Sometimes it‚Äôs even difficult building relationships guests (the nice regulars). used seeing next drink well everyday, one day they‚Äôre gone (RIP Mike üôèüèªüôèüèª) Red Cross folks masked, sanitized, gloved. felt safe me, went two days ago. bit better w/ protecting ~~citizens~~ *economy* corona right hurt himself. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs direct. It‚Äôs hearing bad Covid allows people feel intellectually morally superior downplaying severity. Notice top comment people stupid getting it. Um... country went curve month earlier, who's lock measures Italians could followed, oh well... Lucky live world western countries matter. want report coworkers wearing masks joking FL, required county, know go. 

Management thing enforce it. Well tell countries applied travel bans United States. careful, lot Kn95's recalled and/or banned explain birds? birds literally dinosaurs. Oh that. amount people hear sniffling coughing public places ludacris. seems people less educated. don‚Äôt mean formal education much people willfully ignorant. think learned everything time 15 shut possible change world view. Versus people like ‚ÄúThe learn know don‚Äôt know much.‚Äù poor guy wear mask Mickey costume FL summer  Nothing, wanted shit city flattened curve really well also expressing they're personal feelings BLM protests. There's one every thread (what protests murders emails. shit different year.)  back home country, Vietnam, first breakout COVID-19. neighbors China multiple direct trading routes general conscience disliking China (an old inappropriate mindset tbh), took problem seriously. time, took granted actions people, thought logical try help protect others pandemic. Boye wrong.

My break ended came back 4th dimension empire, Australia via teleportation. time, Australia around roughly 300 cases changes see airport? Nothing. officers wearing gloves that, nothing noticeably different. plain ol' crowded airport absolutely consideration (well some) super contagious virus. Vietnam SEVEN cases acted like world end, investigating traveling history, isolating potential patients, monitoring family members confirmed cases, etc.

Eventually tho, almost everyone grew accustomed sight masks started see taking pandemic seriously. huge relief seeing really helps anxiety attacks whenever went outside.

Now, imagine first heard situation America, damn rough. numbers cases starting rising rapidly, help baffled amount ignorance time. feel truly sorry trying best protect community Karen(s) continues dominate Facebook realm supreme intellect. Got immediately touch good buddy mine living Wisconsin, told everything basically normal (don't quote this) again, brain farted. 

And that's it, wanted state take situation past couple months, basically let rant mentality privileged individuals. 

I wish yall best fighting back pandemic, feeling losing loved ones something beyond painful would want anyone go it. Thanks reading, cheers. Well, $1200 clearly booze... Reality would test people take rational religion. know fringe lots people sub asserting that. right. Chicago, NY, DC great despite ground zero largest protests. we.

YOU talking confirmed cases.  

I talking per capita, already indicated important.

If can't get that's important, well, that's you. Coronavirus bad policy, name iconic duo. wonder there's case spike. current set restrictions liberal - they're followed!

Do need regular surprise inspections something? too. Sometimes symptoms even recur seems well 98.6 Allergy sufferers, themselves, often cannot tell flu cold starting. symptoms allergic rhinitis, symptoms seasonal cold flu, essentially identical.  tell difference histamine reaction (something blooming), histamine reaction (an infection) ? basically can't tell difference. *because protests

Fixed ya  They'll get soon enough. god damn people country dumb. New Zealand, South Korea (your information inaccurate), Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong (aware technically country), Costa Rica, Iceland, Rwanda name few. Hypocritical left reddit back bullshit checkbox form, defense get sued spreading virus thing mentioned right US attorney.

I'm one believes thing ""natural right"". are. never argued ""natural rights"". useless. Luckily far mayors KC STL saved state. downvoted? read article right here:

*But* [*a new study funded National Bureau Economic Research* another explanation: protests prompted overall increase people staying home, mostly offset impact transmission among protesters.*  realistic true idea them? There's much shit going one video rise top. Houston's rioting thousands people surging here.  work Houston, 75% clientele protests sick Covid-19. V SHAPED RECOVERY India skews young, recovery rate higher compared somewhere like Italy (or China) skew quite bit older. significant proportion 1.4 Billion Indians get infected, it'll bad, though. We‚Äôre going die No.

These guys trying get drunk, sanitizer methanol based instead ethanol based died. Yea don‚Äôt see businesses getting another business easily sport sorry going this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are recovered now? neurologists predict long-term damage like?

Thanks sharing. guess, whatever need call me, prefer keep calling something.  China knows serious is. Quite frankly, ridiculous expect protests contributing factor. several videos images tens thousands people California huddling together downtown LA, front mayor's home more. Hundreds wearing masks thousands following social distancing. 

The data never full proof though article mentions due exposure took place.

I also saw several people's Instagram stories Twitter sharing tell tested protest. stories would basically say 1) refuse healthcare protesting 2) theyll blame spike us.

How many believed lied whereabouts unknown, definitely worrying. Yup, would even way, maybe cases miss ones reported covid-19 aren't. know, putting there, cheers downvoting Reddit love you. three months people cheering virus, predicting hospital overruns shortages ventilators. It‚Äôs literally happened single time US. Yet again, predicting apocalypse coming tWo wEeKs^tm

Just give fucking rest already Dinosaurs created Chinese! Worldometers.info don‚Äôt know downvoted it‚Äôs 100% confirmed armed individuals wearing UA. something military wouldn‚Äôt do. parks Central Florida closed March, people testing positive virus worked international tourists. worked hotels, airport, people regularly exposed tourists. also time refugees northern states placed stay-at-home orders states. 


After first wave, patients, much staff dropped regular schedule clinic ran skeleton crew. tourists, patients. 


Then businesses reopened month. Less half incoming patients came mask give one entering doors. Last week first shift working home location since redeployed back April. saw almost 200 patients 24 hours least 95% wanting tested virus. 


We've many patients test positive, we're running cleaning supplies nearly every shift. county Disney located mandated use masks public areas *last week* Disney planning open less 3 weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

We disinfect every single room top bottom patient given flack patients complaining wait times. hands started bleeding often wash them. People getting tested irresponsibly selfish significantly immunocompromised.


People talking Florida hit massive wave like New York northeastern states pandemic first started called d-o-o-m-e-r. Well. is. 


Florida right work state US, healthcare business like everything else. average LPN $20/hr here. working Florida's largest healthcare organization hand? $15/hr. theory could transfer, organization buying everything around here, finding job pay least 10% state average going miraculous. 


I wish paycheck depend number ~~customers~~ ~~*clients*~~ **patients** have. see point - probably unclear - impression immunity/science behind virus irrelevant. question social thought experiment; objective, scientific debate.

Allow rephrase: assuming find vaccine, assuming cannot build herd immunity, assuming discover new treatments, assuming build resistance - **assuming virus always pose risk fatality,** - humans - tolerate prohibition physical social interaction forever?

Personally, don‚Äôt think so. Sadly, agree. talking bout rights can't bothered responsibilities Pretend work. put something air vent kills virus... air vent. Meanwhile, we've got people sitting next other, singing, shaking hands, possibly dipping fingers holy water taking bread wine shared vessel. 

Even work, matter. Even best case scenario physical contact, supposed help? Everybody takes breath holds ten minutes air get though AC taking another? Ethernet equipped specs important Yes yes no.

The things necessary secure liberty. nuke would secure liberty, destroy millions civilians. find date daily case numbers america. interested , thanks stay safe politics rule appears dont like. heard Minority Report 2 3 different studies areas high Fox News viewership correlating worst outbreaks. 

I would highly recommend ‚ÄúThe Brainwashing Dad‚Äù. It‚Äôs low budget, good documentary Fox News it‚Äôs impact people‚Äôs personal lives decision making. Fixthemask.com went michigan state. Harpers shit show normal nights. School isnt even session, would way fucking worse college kids town Scary. Thank sharing impact Covid 19. Jesus Christ, Key West looks insane. Everyone masks around necks, clustering groups...how bars even open right now? people getting go drinks walking around them? Keys issued mask mandate, gonna get bunch drunks give shit? Disgusting. know long recovery show antibodies? Oh believe me, I‚Äôm grandparents living. lock down. since we‚Äôve opened up, go back work. means kid goes daycare. many risks. Going back work means unemployment help. things slowed, kind fucks us all. That‚Äôs meant: ‚Äúoption‚Äù work clients dwindling income. That‚Äôs going problem businesses. people think fighting life protests NYC enormous, infection rate continued slowly decline despite existence. picture, wearing masks. say Gucci Inadequateception False. guns necessary mean defense property person liberty. 

Attorneys aren‚Äôt natural. Wanna get rid right too?

Doctors aren‚Äôt natural. Wanna get rid supposed right healthcare?

Let‚Äôs keep playing game  far take argument?

Should private citizens allowed tanks? Fighter jets? Nuclear weapons? Can‚Äôt carny way virus. don‚Äôt say. love facts facts you‚Äôve presented! See 6 months retard Advice wanted.
My 11 13yo dad last 6 weeks. denier. afraid virus (50, overweight, cancer-survivor). live Vegas. kids come home Monday (6/29). Two days ago took day trip So.Cal beach. I'm pretty sure they've socializing local friends family indoors, without masks entire 6 weeks.

What protect come home? I'm thinking sucking cost running A/C constantly cracking doors windows bring much fresh air possible, staying 6 ft apart much possible, maybe even wearing masks? long concerned? get tested?
I 2 HEPA air purifiers run high 24/7. also run humidifiers. I've exercising, losing weight, taking kinds supplements I'm still freaking little. Boudain joking. highly recommend book Kitchen Confidential. mean flu currently levels undetectable, like flu Go ahead back garbage evidence. baffles me, gathering large illegal (no pun intended). used go bar college. anything like then, it‚Äôs full biggest douche bags Michigan State offer. went friends DJ would play couple times month. surprised cesspool establishment home outbreak. need change name ‚ÄòMerican Airlines. thing obvious literally everyone. places barely make payroll 100% capacity wait times people think months (if year) half capacity going work? It‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs like asking car dealership stay open selling car month. Well scary. Based hours upon hours stream viewing, I‚Äôd say mask compliance around 30-50% 

One thing saw people walking streaming taking mask talk. 

So people may wearing masks, taking lot. Nah, boss even early time. Tbh heard read let doctors put ventilator catch this. think money goes, black holes sales tax? Economically, great president. He's idiot stage, he's handled pandemic terribly, unproven allegations regarding racism, sexism, rape, homophobia (in particular order), but, january, economy affected americans everything else government could throw people.  insane. need read widely. fly recently? Curious I‚Äôm fly site employees required wear mask. LA County could make lot money say need desperate risk losing projects actually sent police arrest jail business' fail follow rules. Make greedy owners completely responsible whole mess causing, arrest offer immediate release fat fine paid front - otherwise jail them.

This city municipalities police need concentrating resources, marching streets trying intimidate protesters. vaccine isn‚Äôt coming anytime soon. media stopped promoting baseless claim, maybe certain countries would start taking seriously. make valid points. question is,

What at-risk groups getting virus younger population? remove care homes slaughterhouse fault own, remaining population infected choice, sympathise ?  delete political comments support one side Wear fucking mask! smart lot people seems. Dont forget hospitalization death rates trail infection rate week two... young people getting sick now, means elderly getting sick week two... means another weeks truly vulnerable populations serious trouble.

More importantly, lets pretend virus nothing deal. younger people death may likely, long term complications (and neurological issues newer studies finding) serious concerns. bottom line thing control, takes extreme measures try bring back down. Murica big. ""Oh yeah?"" July 4th: may die, that's risk I'm willing take. I‚Äôm AZ governor held one, two conferences he‚Äôs doubled nothing help us yet water parks filled brim. see people lined stairs, gripping handles, dripping sweat snot, using shared plastic tubes, carpets, sleds crammed plastic chairs tables. understand. Oh yes....and school due start two weeks since year round schedule. also dire straits.  get downvoted factual truth. overload healthcare systems killing people would otherwise dead, including pneumonia-related deaths count likely lead overcounting.


At time, number undetected cases also rather high, likely numerous covid-related deaths missed, well deaths covid-related simply crippled hospitals ICU's. sense, overcounting might adequate, covid killing people get it, killing people can't get treatment help it. beginning. 

I know news media portraying like mystery. ""OMG new record today! Ahh going do!"" Yeah, joke. seen before. 

 knocking front door like bad meme. 

This played Wuhan, Italy, NY, Seattle (although sent NG Seattle quick AF shut reporting there). know exactly whats headed way.  

This going settle tomorrow. going declining numbers WEEKS, maybe Months. 

That's lock everything NOW. won't. silver spoons wont allow that. 

We going multiple cities, perhaps states, go hard. going brutal AF. 

Mask up, Stock Lock up. question kind confusing. lockdown put place people care complying suggestions. lifted, they're acting way beginning outbreak.. Slavery mistake. second amendment wasn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm arguing founding fathers made mistakes. I‚Äôm arguing calling one successes mistake

The second amendment vital still important. I‚Äôm willing sit forced. giving hopeful answer. think people would see we're fucked, hopefully smart thing. possible won't, absolutely, countries might ignore *cough America cough* believe others, what's smart.  lot Asian countries act like Karen someone come put place know mean. look excess death metric everything essentially shut down. means driving deaths likes off. still massively exceeded average death toll. may true deaths counted aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs much likely died weren‚Äôt counted. metrics probably undercounted. Durrrr? today, way people wear masks (as neck instead face, nose uncovered) won‚Äôt really matter sadly. ah youre assuming people white single black person agrees them. interesting. totally racist What's ""we"" shit. Fall sword hope Trump distances Abbott like Plague.  know I? important compare per capita basis one trying determine bad outbreak given country.

Sort chart per capita think harder. Ok need Quebec vs NT(c?) Stats. Anyone less lazy? public since weekend trip NJ got canceled? There‚Äôs Big Boy Los Angeles? don‚Äôt watch fox dumbass. US contributed 25.5% number Question pandemic, many participated staying home, practicing social distancing, proper hygiene, wearing mask? huge factors pandemic take individual responsibility keep safe others need take issue seriously. looks things US, virus fake administration aside, many citizens really took seriously world also reached 10 million infections. Reality check: party person flu, chances lot people catch it. end world!!!! Using riots excuse stupidty isnt way it

Uhhhhhh. Ahhhhhhhh. Ouf.. lot stupid people. least Darwinism working. That's defunding police work something. still confirmed cases mile. Imagine wanting go one worst hit states vacation.  well said. impossible. Sorry facts trigger so. sorry. couple issues post. First, lift lockdowns safely. It‚Äôs happened Europe many US states. Many states experience surges this. meet CDC protocols easing lockdowns reopened anyway. argument economy, actions hurt economy long run. 

Secondly, know little long-term health effects disease patients hospitalized even weren‚Äôt. 

The long-term effects pretty frightening doctors seeing patients younger never hospitalized. [This includes pretty long list researchers seeing. case don‚Äôt read article, here‚Äôs sampling milder ongoing symptoms:

‚ÄúNearly 88% patients reported persistent intense fatigue, almost three four continued shortness breath. enduring symptoms included, among things, chest pressure (45% patients), headache muscle ache (40% 36%, respectively), elevated pulse (30%), dizziness (29%). Perhaps startling finding 85% surveyed patients considered healthy prior getting Covid-19. One months getting disease, 6% consider healthy.‚Äù

And addition worrisome issues like lung damage, heart damage, brain damage, blood clots lead strokes embolisms.

And forget many discharged hospital haven‚Äôt gone home yet. sent rehab centers stay month longer get physical types therapy help regain strength learn cope long-term health effects. realize Cena hasn‚Äôt wrestled full time wwe years?

Many moderate conservative still careful riots said F afterward. someone lives moderate conservative area I‚Äôm repeating buzz I‚Äôve hearing. That‚Äôs current sentiment whether want deny not. Well, every news channel turn on, every talk radio show turn on, downplays this. government tells us big deal, people catch tell us something different. I'm sure anyone else, 100% isolated since April. know believe. Good ya. Displacement good pandemic. Everywhere go, (which like two stores) people following guidelines. People wearing masks becoming uncommon phenomenon. Social-distancing? Nonexistent. know many parties gatherings thrown, little safety precautions. Wtf happened? New York Florida roughly equal population. Florida slightly larger. 

New York state‚Äôs worst day reported cases 11k. Florida‚Äôs worst day (so far) almost 11k. 

Florida going blow New York coming week. going disaster. 99% people would perfectly happy level strong muscle absolutely achieve without gym. Also vitamin immunompdulator.

The foam fingers gonna need redesign July 4. March. lost taste smell never fully came back. I'm 25% used be. lots people state wearing masks one.

We better idea years. vaccine within two years extraordinary achievement doubt. it‚Äôs completely beyond realm possibility either. doubt US excellent infrastructure make happen. like said business dissecting intricacies US pandemic response. (Except maybe note that, US citizens trust issues federal government appears bleeding scientific institutions well). 

What know countries infrastructure academic institutions par US collaborating scale never seen developing vaccine also scaling production manufacturing. Double secret 10 million mark. gotta think many people *don‚Äôt know* they‚Äôre infected, come contact hundreds people, turn thousands. 

It‚Äôs safe bet guesstimate doubles, given viruses like work - 1 turns 2, turns 4..8..16..100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000...10000, 20,000. *know* million cases US alone..

what even mean? Nope small price pay 'natural immunity'. /s Actually. Sorry bearer bad news. surges coming mainly border states (CA AZ TX FL)? migration Latin America something? can‚Äôt reopening CA hasn‚Äôt really reopened like others. states reopened real early (GA) seeing surges. What‚Äôs going on? live here. weird witnessing people flock town. concerning see many people care. Asian person that's living U.S 8 years, would say, least friends (mainly Japan China) confused. know tje American culture, read major American news, share similar views, however many Asians‚Äò mind, matter ridiculous American news get (for example Twitter president), America still strongest country world, expect U.S react better this.


Plus movies like watch, America saves world every time, brother watched Independence Day countless times. kinda makes think country great technology top intelligent people handle things really well. agree, industry. government literally done nothing actually help industry, operate thin margins, still owe rent bills. lot restaurant industry extremely abusive don‚Äôt give shit ppl working sick, always assume you‚Äôre faking hung get fired. it‚Äôs surprising everybody horrible, government needs bail small biz rent bills. city already ton long time popular establishments Closing Indefinitely it‚Äôs US quarantined point.

12.5 people 125k bonkers belief defy justify saying this. anyone else really scared Americans thinking holidaying? live country summer lot tourists even American I'm still really scared especially live beach town. people live countries get lot American tourists, scared they're selfishness recklessness? testing pneumonia deaths? counting ones died diagnosis? patient gets tested, dies, diagnosis comes back positive later, count positive go back change cause death?

Yesterday, new infection milestones set almost daily, governor refused re-impose restrictions also stated statewide mask requirement unenforceable therefore would good impose one. 

This complete utter garbage. impose speeding limits difficult enforce, strike laws books reason. mask requirement different? 

I fully expect new restrictions imposed July 4th. lifted Labor Day. 

As South Carolinian implore you, safety, STAY AWAY SOUTH CAROLINA. 

It safe here, please carry coronavirus back home loved ones. 

Our government knew people would harmed killed reopening early, anyway. 

They wanted money, life damned. d*eath panels* coming, even O-care gutted. Crazy things happen. leadership media gave clear messaging.

Well Delta's airline fly shitty one-gate local airport, glad they're this. Lol. Take step back keyboard. You‚Äôre talking extreme minority situations. Somehow I‚Äôve lived 50 years without seeing first hand you‚Äôre talking about. can‚Äôt serious. card holders decline treatment get Covid? could possible. RNA viruses much higher mutation rates, perhaps one mutation per virus genome copy. Mutations deleterious, neutral, occasionally favorable less harmful humans totally IQ thing. Lots Americans idiots. Oh hey, hiding numbers, thing corrupt people do. Blood Christ something voodoo shit. Bla bla. Exactly! dumb don‚Äôt even know freedom talking  ^ statement inconsistent reality. Please check worldometers.info educate yourself. housemates auntie died last month. People unemployment New York getting much $1100/week individual, many earning working. need get antiquated. Restaurants Florida need follow rules too! Wow, sounds like someone needs bigger tinfoil hat. can't right, Vince part reopening committee Well, let's break down. Define word ""natural"" define word ""rights"", define word ""natural rights"". China control government handles outbreak, swine flu broke California 2009 estimated infected 11-21% worlds entire population. see countries around world waving fingers calling 'american pig virus' (as seen people call china bat virus) blaming america spreading ultimately out, government health officials country act accordingly deal with, MANY countries world done Covid. 

Again, want point fingers anyone point country, government feel handled correctly. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. I‚Äôm American woman travelled extensively US shitty lots way regarding gender equality rape absolutely worse women many places, including India. Yup, agree, many many many people died due this, undoubtedly horrible, taking away severity situation, I'm pointing death rates might bit off. necessarily agree love care part, although health workers article truly seem care patients. think people developing countries take good health granted. face risks dysentry, cholera dengue (among things) time even global pandemic happening. hand, people developed countries seem think never fall ill. People (yes including economists) need learn economy free floating abstract concept, it‚Äôs sum activity occurring nation. We‚Äôre 1/10 way herd immunity that‚Äôs best case scenario. It‚Äôs pretty easy math. Taking mask would painful... ~~you~~ everyone. Thank you! fundamentally understand sub would like request leave alone Apparently billion dollars $1200 check sent dead people despite many living people receiving it.

Meanwhile way money sent super wealthy corporations making record profits years workers expense. take money throw stock market tell employees get back work safe. Make sick. China found nervous system back Jan Feb. interview patient China Jan/Feb essentially said 'I consciously breathe now, happen automatically' somehow they'll evade death ruining countless lives along way. Except ends month, what?  I'm sure frustrating also think degree keep mind lot people scared thinking completely rationally right now. Yeah Aunt basically nursing home last 15 years serious health issues home got hit, contracted without symptom. She‚Äôs terribly obese, already air, diabetes, I‚Äôm sure whole lot issues result decades obesity. COVID didn‚Äôt anything her. Strange. polite, gathering idiots one place. hope get COVID-19. Well first I‚Äôm using term ‚Äúnatural‚Äù 

I‚Äôm using term ‚Äúnatural rights‚Äù

Which really it‚Äôs word much winning ‚úå  Could please define word ""natural""? honestly strawman dude. talking arguments wanting reopening vs. arguments protests. That's common argument reopening (albeit presented biased manner): people want able go places before, expect service.  Glad actually like taking stairs. bad that's practical building ~5 stories. leftist, feels little weird saying this, think willingness admit mistake significantly seen many others doubled stupidy. phrase ""I made mistake"" opens door serious conversation things could managed better. discussions necessary time. 2-2 weeks onset symptoms. yet know long detectable. least 2-3 months minimum guess. [Source: dum I‚Äôm sorry. Opened up?...didn't realize guy's shut down. US wrong end world war 2?

But seriously, far take argument? said people allowed arms defend tyranny, saying limit arms people own.

So draw line?

The reality think limits arms people allowed own. limit little strict yours. Wait two weeks 

We dead streets. 

Scary. 

Bring dead...
Bring dead Use real rates. would get 104 tests 20 positives week 2. arguing 5 additional positives mostly caused 4 extra tests. possible. used like diaster movies boss/general/mayor sends evertbody headlong disaster, thought unrealistic. ""Nobody would ever that, bad writing"".

Turns real life people dumber dumbest characters disaster horror movies. like everything else: people. people went wrong.¬† would like take opportunity remind people Ron DeSantis went Yale Harvard. per Google/Wikipedia: **Education:** Harvard Law School (2005), Yale University (2001).

He knows better. wilful negligence. Lol imagine buying monthlies negative revenue move without pricing yourself. reddit. Oh hey, thing China said probable back like February. blame everything millennials.... thirties. Yes, country ‚Äúworks fine‚Äù exploiting, raping murdering indigenous people people color. 

Nah, needs destroyed. standing shoulder shoulder hours city doesn't? 


C'mon. honest. Get personal political beliefs it.  


A bunch leftists city square CLOSER people Trump rally.  


If one irresponsible, also. Lol believing humans born inherent liberties man right violate antiquated?

Look carefully future want apart dude. It‚Äôs bad one may need opt sub. I‚Äôm get thing it‚Äôs making constantly terrified. 2 people according Google California FL, look white one Spanish last name

I believe she‚Äôs implying China based comment history Please stay Canada! Thanks. Jesus fucking Christ. childish. type shit expect CHILDREN! Wear damn mask. want CDC put memo telling people wipe ass take shit. wonder many refuse cause ""freedom."" I'm sure travel much. /S know would say that, know long phase would last, since I'm epidemiologist, doubt even know without testing out. Seeing what's sweet spot. Ffs we‚Äôre talking half million people dying. decency course *want* to. really mean shit right now.

My point older coaches staff choice feel safe Orlando bubble. People making seems like NBA forcing go risking life without letting choice matter way case rate.

A 5.2% (16/302) positive case rate COVID-19 NBA players slightly average United States, 6.4% positive case rate June 26th, 2020, all, that's bad grand scheme things. reality situation COVID-19 cases United States. goal lower positive case rate much possible, physical distancing, face masks, hand washing, regular cleaning surfaces, etc. hopefully idiots stop going crowded bars crowded parties adding fuel fire. people need embrace wearing face masks public, disappointing certain people think mass mask wearing work dont care bubble, happening. amount time going take quarantine clear every infected person alone delay start.

The NBA season starts month so, reckon that's enough time people COVID-19 right quarantine hopefully recover soon well, head Orlando bubble, everybody enters test negatively twice COVID-19. We'll see happens though. Hopefully everything NBA goes well lol No. Shit. Wish stepmom would literally read CDC‚Äôs website lmao many worldwide flu deaths there, like average? violates constitutional right idiot!! /s NEW YORK STATE != NEW YORK CITY COME BRO \*Deaths coronavirus Almost half America, yay Trump I‚Äôve worst headaches life last months since sick. chalked allergies knows. get back work and..... think it‚Äôs inflammation, steroid helping new cases. sure you‚Äôre downvoted. Sadly likely gonna happen. taking account 2nd wave worldwide deaths average around 3k day still hit mill plus. bad anything like Alpa Chino's Booty Sweat? got bacterial meningitis turned cerebritis. commission 3 months total told bacterial actually better viral could fought IV antibiotics self administer 3 times day. hear makes say bacterial worse? much gun monies. enough doctor monies. Forging legal documents crime countries, I‚Äôm USA, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs case there, too. 

So see card, simply call local law enforcement. Stay strong brother!! friend suffered 2 years chronic fatigue getting mono, hang there. Yes donating blood.  That's basically it. many people think like him. Restaurants contribute work somebody's Stand... truly wish best luck. really truly f****** ignorant think I'll stray way safe what's occurring climate.

Where f*** fires back? That's going become normal, among thousand things dont blame there. I'm VT miss living badly. moving back soonish whole thing really screwed things we're staying time instead agree implementing toughest part. Still, see lot bickering much coming together brainstorm ideas may better. saying U take back! global knowledge yet!!! /gg work Universal. honestly feel safer go work front house Universal going local grocery store. companies taken time diligence set operations work safely. 

If looking cases exploded, look much bars indoor dining areas. places supposed open heavily reduced capacity, nearly breaking regulations day 1. Compared Universal, seating capacity restaurants literally 25-30% normal capacity. What? First all, Italy letting tourists month without quarantine countries same. travel 20 countries Europe without quarantine it‚Äôs Italy. agree conclusion presented article, think important overall view alternative views (except masks violates ""Ma Freedumb"" BS). actually seem interesting analysis universal mask usage lockdowns would unnecessary. 

Open discussion merit even walk away disagreeing conclusion. People fucking entitled would complain sit outside heat. that's surge capacity works. Happens flu season well. become national news. Exactly. many stores close even 10pm give employees time close go home. hope people wearing masks Texas. LA/OC main Karen spawn point? Heh, get lot. good name. Ironically, shit say stupid. least recognize say stupid shit.

For example, even though original post 4 downvotes, I'm sure anyone could confused it. sarcasm quite clear reference so-called Hoax rise Covid numbers Florida.

For someone question that, believe stupid. :) 

Now keep mind, I'm trying insult you, anyone. think every day, say way stupid shit admit. accountable ourselves, we'd accept quite error prone, quite easy manipulate. that, need extra vigilant validating ideas.

So, admit stupid (everyone) we'll better off. sooner admit recognize mistakes, sooner mend improve ourselves. all, seek improve ourselves, requires us recognize good something, put mind improving it.

I'm willing admit call is. We're weak. Recognize use opportunity improve ourselves. Currently am! I‚Äôm trying get unemployment program called California Training Benefits understanding get unemployment attending school/training eventually get job whatever field train for, California. works like unemployment, don‚Äôt certify say looking work available work. It‚Äôs good 2 years. get I‚Äôd happy would cut potential debt. No, call police them. Forging legal documents crime. thing here: love go Vermont several times year happening long time now

/ sadpanda Two reasons:

1) Privacy. talking instituted en masse population something people free countries keen on. creepy Target it, permission keep data gave them. It'd even creepy government it.

2) Time. Target years data customers work off. Covid-19 relatively new. sub shits average people ""reading science"" every comment thread literally made hypothetical numbers fantasy worst case scenario. beaches open sun shining. long take results? husband tested last Friday. officially Sunday, still result. week.  live pretty densely populated area LA. really left apartment much except groceries walking dog. wear mask times I'm outside.

Now see walking dog going groceries? see people opposite me. Going lives like normal. wearing mask. Like nothing happening. don‚Äôt think true number hospitalizations deaths understood Japan. needs comparison deaths last months previous years see bad really was.

I think social masking definitely helped keep curve lower US, it‚Äôs hard say Japanese government competent handling virus response.

I think second wave arrives Tokyo real test response.

Back topic though, point wearing mask prevent deadly virus gaining ground became political issue state governments would reopen despite rules place, that‚Äôs realized US response would necessarily devolve Sweden - it‚Äôs nothing extra steps.

News media needs cover covid-19 survivors probably hammer home even survive virus, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre clear. Long term effects virus aren‚Äôt understood data looks like impair person good long time. may death sentence child, could easily ruin child adult lives. influx applicants might, medical student classes residency positions mostly static. Yeah pretty hard, luckily one good people anyone still struggling disease 30 days there's support group ""long haulers"" like yourself.
 Sign form: built testing infrastructure mass testing reopen safely. does, way less effective sick person one on, since droplets inhibited getting air first place

[not epidemiologist might slightly wrong] great idea! Today drove around found areas one go back week hike. takes planning used lucky live L.A balcony get much needed sun. made great decision hope enjoy Oh, sure, normally cancel elective procedures move adult patients children's hospitals time. I‚Äôve gym membership since 2006 $20. haven‚Äôt gone 2 years equipment home... can‚Äôt talk canceling plan I‚Äôve grandfather it‚Äôs 45 month. 

I know math isn‚Äôt I‚Äôve spend several times without going but.... maybe I‚Äôll start again, right? Seriously, Singapore last country *ever* want break law in, matter minor American Exceptionalism grandfather got Scarlet Fever kid. died playing sports age 30 heart attack due damage caused virus organs. know exactly age Scarlet Fever occurred, would late 1930s 40s. Obviously, never met him, dad turned 1 week died.

**Ramble alert/relevant family history research story**

Grandma remarried man also lost spouse kid. Though always ""grandpa"" me, sometimes feels like patrilineal influence lost way--just dad, myself, siblings stranded fairly uncommon surname associated nothing. Everything know pieced together research random objects, photos, art passed down.

The two grandpas were/are completely different people. ""step""-grandfather serious, religious, inactive diabetes since younger dad now, ""you kids calm down,"" ""law order"" type (very welcoming new people family, though, expansive definition).

My genetic grandfather characteristic goofy/sneaky smile see my, father's, siblings' faces (in fact, people know us could spot [our surname] class lineup 30 kids early 1900s). found newspaper articles getting speeding tickets playing baseball. death, line family lived artists multiple generations avid sports players back late 1800s (we inherited cool turn-of-the-century baseball photos), great-great grandfather emerged farm, moved city, converted Catholicism, started painting.

Yet, miraculously, think nature took course lot ways, even different fatherly influence. can't know sure, feel like dad much like biological father, playing sports adulthood, blasting classic rock speeding, creating things, child heart always time kids, irreverence towards religion, etc.

**tl;dr:** Anyway, even like 80 years virus infected kid ""recovered,"" still casting certain grimness sense loss. dumbass sheriffs areas won‚Äôt enforce did. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Same, two elderly parents rural Idaho, land FrEeDuMs1!11 idiots. kills think everything others household given last three months trying right thing others. life we‚Äôre depressed. feels like it‚Äôs nothing, selfish jackasses places can‚Äôt wear masks stay home. sarcastic? better Yea, true enough. well, agreed, quite happy progress having. nervous openings due cause number people wearing masks non-distancing parks beaches... thankfully, fine, know still shockingly high number don't. reporting got shut Seattle, Inslee shut state pretty quick. 'asked' nicely times people stay home cases still rising, shut down. phased reopening county. counties east side never really followed order, they're stuck Phase 1 hospitals capacity. Elsewhere state, cases rising slowly point cant handled. Inslee damn good job flattening curve still got people calling overreaction, understanding feeling like win. South Korea too. Mostly open, EVERYONE wears masks work stats have. 

You‚Äôre including deaths identified caused Covid. many places it‚Äôs pneumonia Lombardy, Italy 1600 deaths per million. According worldometers Texas currently 83 deaths per million Florida 158 deaths per million. 
I try explain friend people aren‚Äôt randomly getting tested they‚Äôre getting tested feel sick known associated somebody said oh I‚Äôve tested positive. opinion people testing positive people inkling something wasn‚Äôt right agree completely, think need share message public still need worry getting coronavirus even don‚Äôt think kill them. stories people‚Äôs quality live stripped away need told. You‚Äôre way likely permanently injured illness killed it. good reasons protect one another! Same. Also, mucus cloudiness, know fact I'm sick allergies. Yea greedy shit grocery chain Wegmans used covid excuse longer open 24 hrs, ""to better serve customers"". get shopping window compressed 8am 10pm. Unfortunately there‚Äôs going lot uh...‚Äùside deaths‚Äù thing? People hurting, people scared, there‚Äôs clear end sight speaking states lot called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù failing hard right actually making worse. 

This really want see compassion unity everything else. thing would so, much manageable recognized problem hand worked together solution instead downplaying ignoring it, causing even divisiveness. States especially, it‚Äôs clearly global problem underscoring point innocent people hurting/suffering we‚Äôre collectively capable much better what‚Äôs shown far. 

We ***can*** this. Real leaders need rise help right anyway can, people hurting. Don‚Äôt ever forget lives lost stress hurt, even they‚Äôre official COVID-19 deaths. Avatar checks out. grew WA rare see air conditioning, outside malls Ideas easy. Implementation problem. political, solely mentions word. stating fact representative data set. Bigfoot. That's I've saying whole time. shrank dick size fianc√© get tuberculosis test got job assisted living facility. form South dude, prominent De Luca Campania. admit you‚Äôre wrong rather buckling down. Men wait donate three months sex FDA guidance ‚ÄúRevised Recommendations Reducing Risk Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission Blood Blood Products‚Äù states, ‚ÄúDefer 3 months recent sexual contact, man sex another man past 3 months.‚Äù U.S. blood collection organizations must follow federal requirement.  bunch lockdown protests Vancouver although never large. Yes actually. plan. White suburban culture needs die. don‚Äôt think 1% even want ACA repealed. already baked adjusting new normal Trump took office. Doctors, insurance companies, drug companies, hospitals OK ACA. think it‚Äôs like poor people supporters don‚Äôt know better. dad got pneumonia nearly 5 years ago. heart never recovered operating reduced capacity, even implant help regulate it. downvoted laughed Reddit stating 5-6% rate death.  huge bulk infections Southern California, massive infestation Karen types there. nutters care personal inconveniences wearing masks, notice bulk cases counties centered around LA.

Here Northern California, lot people taking shit seriously. went Target that's stone's throw live, could count number people *weren't* wearing mask one hand. Every one employees wearing face covering kind, wearing face mask wearing pull sort face covering. saw five people total store face mask on, even guarded adhered social distancing guidelines. One line going back social distancing stickers, one objected it.

I think Bay Area Sacramento want deal shit LA dealing with, Sacramento shutting bars voluntarily kind implying mask wearing going enforced soon. 

Karens welcome Northern California. Go fuck back Southern California. seem implying way communicate people talk face face, exposing harm process. pandemic taught us anything, far case. Someone saying Trump winning win 2020...
Bets ? ....golden shower finest..... track 2010 study down, I'd super appreciative! sounds interesting, looked come anything.  outdoor + UV kills covid19 feel free protest cough other's faces. think think anything beyond ""What's good billionaire friends good country"" intentional probably grossly overestimating beloved leader. Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity. even rare occasions underhanded shit *does* go (the Bone Wars, example), eventually exposed corrected. Science imperfect enterprise done imperfect people, also inherently self-correcting process.  healthcare gonna insane, need push universal healthcare government made pharma is, though. infection rate rises due people complying ""new normal"" take away what's causing infection rates. bars found problematic cause spikes cases, surprised Murphy &amp; Cuomo shut back respective states. Sounds white. Nah, bad stop insane overconsumption regardless Even creationists believe dinosaurs.

This museum hilarious ever get chance take her. Single Canadian Male here. Slide DMs. yup. saw bunch people strolling Denny's without masks like day. People could try something outrageous like...wearing face masks, staying home unless must go out, social distancing, things like that. right though. Negligent horrific happening. Even disinfect heck slums doubt sanitary cities developed nations. local buffet everything right. Take temperature entrance, allowed serve yourself, staff serves change gloves every hour, utensils given completely sealed staff isnt allowed touch them. Plates same. 

Place open. one big window, 12 feet separation table table. stand up, wear mask,lol. usually somewhat realistic guess, allergies particularly harsh eyes. 

If eyes super itchy, red, swollen fever: probably allergies. 

Also get clued consistency coming nose: clear thin probably allergies. (It runs YEAR round, thanks trees) 

But still best guesses rare occasions I've wrong. Jeez. didn‚Äôt think serious virus be, thank giving insight experiencing virus hope recover this. think would backfire cases went proclaimed big deal. reason poor leadership much authority assumed never done before, things like fed printing money buy corporate bonds, giving billions PPP bailouts without oversight big corporations, basically spending money general lots corruption happening. Yeah except stl mayor hot Water right doxxing protesters live stream. Good luck getting anyone trust she‚Äôs says point. positive rate % testing actually tell? like city 3% positive rate, would logical assume around 3% population COVID? im assuming no, test asymptomatic people. better interpretation it? neuropathic cough means damaged nerves throat cause uncontrollable cough reflexes. real, coughing actually anything cannot convince brain real, cough. lot.

My solution go public. call racist like trying group people together discredit them. checked official Trump merch site, online either.

I guess part effort pretend virus exist supporters same. still weird. think it'd great sales opportunity, literally *any* inclination toward actually reducing virus numbers appearance virus numbers think encouraging masks would great way that. You‚Äôre throwing numbers around without understanding them. 20% chance catching virus non-spouse family member doesn‚Äôt equal 20% chance dying - implies mortality rate 100%, isn‚Äôt. FOUR MONTHS?? Dear god. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going this. Ppl area don‚Äôt care all. It‚Äôs frustrating selfish ppl are. Hello ModBot, able tell keyword caused post deleted? Thanks! bastard. He's forgotten he's supposed work for. Yes, yes would. never get vaccine? 32, former bartender, stay home mother- classes complete med school reqs. Go üôåüèº follow suit. open, contact pronounced them

Not open. packed bar impossible. Temperature taking likely late - since spread comes pre-symptomatic. Sweden enters chat. shutdown. High death rate. Economy went hell. neighbors shunning them. Live near LA(worse, orange county) confirm, people taking seriously. Worldometers India finally breaking 20,000!

20,131 last count.

Obviously, small variance measurement reporting, resulting difference global tracking Indian news. consensus needed fact? (eg., dinosaurs existed) Keep mind: chair GOP Bexar County said George Floyd‚Äôs murder staged event. Well, since strict ‚ÄúNo Visitor‚Äù policy effect pretty much hospitals probably contributing empty parking lots. sick patients either dropped transported via ambulance. It‚Äôs also Saturday night less staff weekends typically. 

I wish empty parking lots meant empty beds don‚Äôt think case. rising... cases. capacity restrictions based fire marshal occupancy though. number tables restaurants going put 100% capacity excusing complete disregard leaders. all. little reason believe people screaming freedumb ‚Äúmedical problems‚Äù preventing wearing mask. blame goes them. real concern big one time payouts. Many addicts spend drugs take normally would due larger supply. markers spinal tap showed viral meningitis. Bacterial viral meningitis show CSF differently.

The lab ran pcr every known virus, bacteria, spore reponsible meningitis - except covid (I guess covid part meningitis panel yet?). process elimination, caused known things cause meningitis.

The first night developed respiratory symptoms, insane hallucinations bodies exploding pustules turning black ash. felt like bad mushroom trip stop. 

It's definitely grounds starting metal band. f Italy NYC. Florida recovery.  actually Trump approval ratings dont keep dropping.

The moment mention negative news him, call fake news

the moment cite poll/rating that's negative, say fake poll

basically anything factual based say fake, they're basically anti-data, anti-knowledge. Maybe bio weapon. turning people sterile. Man, disappointed hear this. 05-09 sounds like it‚Äôs gotten lot worse there. Used enjoy going live bands, brewed beer good, never crowded believe $3 anythings (maybe Wednesdays?). Unfortunate sounds like went wrong direction. Federal state local. 

In Texas, local governments *wanted* that. Unfortunately us, governor said no. this. Deaths despair, I‚Äôve heard called. ...To get rid idiots, like might get rid cockroaches. can't stand anymore. collateral damage, hey nothing's perfect creation. glad there's flood time...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

/s kinda strange hear, live outside Chicago anyone inside store wearing mask probably 2+ months. Everyone wearing everywhere inside.

Just today first time months wife went diner (Illinois restaurants open limited capacity past Friday). Indoor seating sparse, every booth closed tables well spaced. Diners wearing masks, obviously, every staff member was.

Mind you, first time months saw anyone business wearing mask. Everywhere else, everyone still wearing mask. problem here. people simply dont want considered thieves bondage /s&amp;m. find whatever show violates rights.

This majority know yeesh. stuff I've seen ... New Yorkers screaming roof tops take seriously since early March. Everyone plenty time prepare. ok them, squash‚Äôs tiny outbreaks, 300k cases caught surprise. Ny didn‚Äôt even take serious, people wore masks, people kind distanced. lot people worked home went unemployment, many essential. 

We closed month got states though. We‚Äôll see well fare. Hopefully bad. Stay strong, thoughts n prayers. please tell parents students demanding reopen fall?

I work university. SUPER want reopen fall. students parents largely saying enroll unless they'd rather take gap year take online classes.

I can't fucking life figure why, either. favorite classes I've taken online. might I'm ADHD person appreciates ability rewind lecture, guess? So...lie travel? easy. Let's encourage lying. mean it‚Äôs combination sides dumb. think massive groups people gathering together protesting country magically protected virus fighting good cause seems really stupid me. Main reason... Gov. Andrew Cuomo actually took seriously put lives economy. Problem people realise alot know virus. still new us take lightly obviously plain old stupid. rather make less money feel better much making? swear exact fucking headline gets posted upvotes literally every day Fuck ""right"" potentially harm others. invoke human rights comes driving drunk running red lights? also idiots champion ability private businesses enforce rules religion sexuality - things bearing actual wellbeing others. Wow, thank much. know much means me- i've hearing doom gloom lungs likely permanently damaged media. amendment ii:
an overfed cosplay militia, necessary obesity free state, right people sit eat chick-fil-a, shall infringed face covering.

read constitution, fucking sheep. wish people would take seriously. sucks us staying home. constantly friends trying peer pressure going hang sucks turn down, best. love moving goal post. 

Remember 60k deaths? Last read, know yet. say they're surprised give level immunity amount time, still know much long. There's definitely school thought among professionals gloves get changed often enough, bare hands lead hand washing leads less cross-contamination overall. sure I've ever seen real study done, always started shift gloves on, point rush came frequent hand washing much faster trying put fresh pair gloves sweaty hands. speak Jaws sequels No, open anyone except returning citizens and, recently, people work permits family visas. need tested put mandatory 14 day state quarantine. ""Paid hundred extra fly United."" 

There's sentence I'll never say. get sick, them. virus doesn‚Äôt care Karma either. I‚Äôm honestly scared Trump find way cancel and/or rig election cardiovascular disease Covid? understand trying say (unless weird troll thing going head.) I‚Äôve never heard I‚Äôve Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms nine years. please tell more? 
I told every doctor started flu I‚Äôd also escaped abusive husband around time years depressed anxious. 
Then thankfully got diagnosed methylation disorder treatment immensely helpful silver bullet. 
My muscles fucked. That's problem thing, time numbers start going government takes notice, late. Texas governor ordered bars close - that's great, we've already weeks people packed bars spreading this, every day we're breaking records new cases. still even mandate masks I've living US longer place born grew up. Outside US many people know always see Americans smart, can-do attitude, confident. kids started going school, heard lot US education system focusing teaching kids become confident high self-esteem. living 26 years, noticed confident good, lot people confused confidence arrogance ignorance. Many people think know what's best them. lot time people insinuated I'm 'stupid' 'chicken' I'm always cautious question first instead jumping gun. mid-March, saw news showed checkpoints China (or somewhere Asia) people stopped temperature checked. time remember telling kind thing never work US people ""value"" ""freedom"". Yes, put double quotes words purpose think people reject quarantine wearing masks understand actual meaning words. May ask tests numbers are? creatinine high? Yep, seems quite true. Holy shit. Stay away anyone household, AZ exponential growth mode. sure Russia send us another plane .....37 year old sociopath...... Disney decides reopen. see much conservative news. I'm New York City listening mayor, Bill de Blasio, consistently praise protests. daughter actually arrested one said proud there. best wishes recovery üíú Oooof took 24 hours tested hospital process onsite lab. would call possible misplaced results forgot call. week seems like really long time. Got yelled four times last two days thing. convincing manager don‚Äôt even care don‚Äôt want peoples money, matter many bad reviews give us. Actually im gonna argue first point restaurants, owner operated chained restaurants owners one location, tend razor thin margins really can't afford empty spaces can't pay rent. mean know could sell restaurant go better business really real alternative. Norwegian fuckin shit ever go Europe. First class price normal United People wear masks entering restaurant, talking waiters, walking table. take mask ordered food stop interacting strangers. meal don‚Äôt wear it, put back leave restaurant start walking near costumers. restaurants specials plexiglass separator lunch someone don‚Äôt know (like client work reasons) still divided say seen them. 
Of course waiters everyone else working wear mask whole time. can't even necessarily get mad mask-less people themselves, though. They're drenched fire hose propaganda created people very, good that. leaders media conspiracy pushers truly blood hands. Really sort customer service role. Lord mercy! want interfere God's beautiful breathing system!?!?   /s it‚Äôs stupid compar two situations. Italy first Western country hit nobody idea virus could do. US two weeks behind Italy, watched Italy get devastated virus still screwed everything up. Besides, Italy situation control US can‚Äôt even get first outbreak control. Except USA cases entire continent Europe, despite also less half Europe's population. Deaths lag cases two weeks. Lombardy over, Texas Florida bad part started.

Florida would peak least 15000 cases per day, probably more, even started full lockdown tomorrow, due incubation period. Lombardy peaked 6500 population half Florida. Tell hiv, initially presents flu, quite mild, goes away next 4-7 years destroys immune system. die. replaced doorknob licking stickers. wouldn‚Äôt let people‚Äôs stupidity interfere child‚Äôs health. that‚Äôs happening right now. Well, remember good number people - possibly majority - almost totally symptoms. saying take seriously, saying hopeless :) Thats gonna make Greta cry. DaRe ThEy!!!  uncle grandma mild recovered home fine now. 


Obviously taken seriously sub definitely highlights worst worst. dip sub stressing much.


Just part safe possible that‚Äôs do. likely not, you‚Äôll fine. I'm 30 year old strength athlete, infection lasted 55 days. lungs still 100 percent like 6 weeks since I've recovered. almost July, getting around now? heard someone say, ""they believe conspiracy theories makes feel know something general population doesn't."" it. want feel like they're smarter you, even asinine theory. worry, follow country's reliable trusted source advice. fact concerned means aware paying attention. get anxious, we'll get hopefully we'll better future look forward to, much politically ecologically aware population. Even whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch recover‚Äù thing extremely oversimplifying it. Mine pretty average case sick entire month. That‚Äôs pretty long time wicked cough trouble breathing. everyone else thread, lung capacity nowhere near used be. It‚Äôll probably take months build back up.  got 25 kids stay 4 bedroom house party fuck everyone else here. town full high school graduates June 6-13th 13th-20th. Maybe shared beer bong. houses trashed, filled trash, used condoms, vomit, etc.  local buffet everything right. Take temperature entrance, mandatory hand washing, allowed serve yourself, staff serves change gloves every hour, utensils given completely sealed staff isnt allowed touch them. Plates same.

Place open. one big window, 12 feet separation table table. stand up, wear mask,lol.

Bars follow suit. open, contact pronounced union. went find people lung problems months able get tested like me, loads people listing allergies head cold symptoms. peaced pretty fast. I'll let doctor figure out. Millions protesting? Nope. loud minority, yes. That's covid death count *with social distancing* less. alone evidence needed. try argue many deaths called covid ignoring pneumonia deaths happening 10x normal rate, ones arent counted likely due states like florida count residents state dying covid staters.

It incredible little government corporations give fuck people. hope time gives everyone time reflect social contract government corporations gazillionaires giving/getting versus people giving getting. Contained it? 2000 people died 3 days. Doctors nurses complaining getting paid. numbers getting started India, going get worst. true. That‚Äôs strongman exists.  Jesus fuck, I've watching plague like hawk reason idea viral meningitis even occurred me. I'm really sorry hear that. here‚Äôs idea. Trust everyone else right thing wear mask, social distance, etc etc assume might right thing?

Kinda puts fate hands rather someone else‚Äôs sense people able spread infection develop symptoms like fever. known months...

Even fever, forehead sensors problems accuracy user error. 0.03% fatality ratearino! That‚Äôs awesome . one place Florida Fuck man that's rough:( hope gets better ya soon Well fair US 10 times population saying Yeah, good. Look city county websites see they've got info pertaining testing area. fly wait 3 days (make sure got virus plane time show positive) 

It take 14 days, time reveal 11. think poor underestimate power. Neither eviction debt collection going possible years.

The purpose changes we've seen last years take away power poor tying security jobs. states cities actually let happen. net there, lower we'd want be. One reason think face mask. break Thailand huge problem dust particle(PM 2.5). people congested area like Bangkok already mask wearing break.

My dad like couple dozen N95 lying around outbreak. people know live Bangkok kind mask.  Yeah antibodies gone three months. frustrating someone trying get retroactive diagnosis. he's American, might able afford go otolaryngologist. might available appointments right anyway, depending whole pandemic situation he's at. Seriously? hope changes. Children know social distance every child I‚Äôve seen mask wearing correctly. really scares me. It‚Äôs old fashioned paranoia. course, want say whatsoever state.

As currently constituted, absolutely agree. sick child. Took many antibiotics permanent teeth grew yellow. also spoken people took antibiotics children anxiety depression like me. Gates never touched Windows 10 far know wasn‚Äôt part version‚Äôs development. 

i suggest switching linux ubuntu though :p States seem retroactively ‚Äúcorrecting‚Äù numbers label cause deaths ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù ‚ÄúCovid-19.‚Äù first thought. Well said. virus demonstrated knows bounds students bring virus home families ravage family.""

It grave error treat children immune virus. 
For now, way less susceptible negative health effects sars-cov-2. 
However, reports complications deaths children. 

Please remember viruses mutate. 'living fear'

I think one major psychological issues play here. Wearing mask, instance, sign afraid virus, fear taken weakness basic mammalian instinct hide signs weakness. People also want return normalcy everything goes another anxiety generating blow. shit world saying panic locked 2 weeks... China, Italy, NYC... idiots need herd immunity would great man viruses mutate, fact people get infected, chances virus mutate...and easily spread variation succeed mutations, that's evolution works. scared folks health insurance drinking bleach. Sigh. Apologies assumption. saw plenty discussion protests potentially causing outbreaks. 
At moment, looking like indoor socializing without masks driver new hotspots outdoor activities masks not. Hope continues case people outside summer without causing outbreaks. Winter coming. exactly. one going back lock downs watching worldwide riots media praising them.

Wake state passes new yorks death rate. buying hype spikes nonsense meantime Yeah. Give percent confirmed cases means keep look cases keep confirming, deduce 5 percent may die. continues track, 20 million confirmed cases, might see 1 million deaths. Regardless actual fully infected death rate is.  Let rephrase that. believe it, cannot believe it‚Äôs actually real. agree everything you‚Äôve said. Worth noting even talk asymptomatic people getting lung scarring without immediate signs. Maybe clears up, maybe ends COPD decade two. know awhile yet. Hanlon's Razor.

You likely correct. need vast complex consist enact plan. fact pretty much bumble right it.

This increasingly likely scenario, I'm pretty confident crass opportunism combined shocking level malignant ignorance play mastermind. Testing global pandemic would leave many variables uncertain convince single skeptic

(I support UBI) contained Western Australia. 2 days ago opened almost everything full capacity. community transmission. fact 4 people infection total state four forced hotel quarantine return travelers.

Testing, tracing isolating.  plus side, might find little freedom means people might comply needed road. Covid really shown need go hard fast, can't half arse response people stop obeying goes shit. Meanwhile thousands people protesting pandemic reason military pot hold hiring anyone it. antibodies they've measuring actually protect you. Recent studies show cells first line defense. Indian government also playing covid related political games much like USA government political optics? latest insane conspiracy theory heard number cases Arizona going fast they‚Äôre counting people test positive consecutive days separate cases.

Educated people believe shit absolutely zero evidence, except one single Fox News report guy wrote book unnamed source. stay away public places stupid people taking air lmao kook think long society ruled whole insane oppressive global empire thing we've got going on, people gonna believe random conspiracy theories. species severed truth, denied access information, ruled division, nobody agree anything, individual forced find truth. Naturally results suck. 2020: year taking significant dinner deemed illegal. reason taking seriously. Check survey 1600 patients mild cases: overwhelming majority residual problems even months later. terrifying. feel bad many people blowing caught guard lives forever changed virus.

The reason concerned reports coming suggesting immunity might short-lasting (ie 3-12 months), least, antibody titers high long significant portion population. trolley problem used run 3 miles day severe infection left eating 10 days pretty much lying down. Took felt healthy again. test positive antibodies indefinitely? agree reason behind protests outrage. people participating mental gymnastics try prove false premise protests didn‚Äôt play apart sudden increase experiencing right brain dead. loses vote well enforces lockdown. Keep mind supporters ones demanding reopening wont wear masks. entire platform based belittling problem. 1 million deaths would less catastrophic base lockdowns would be. can't breathe mask, boy oh boy going enjoy pneumonia. I've read several articles false negatives labs 30-60% false negatives, frightening. Well, hope things normal sooner later. appears major culture shift horizon bars restaurants. like scary time American. real. Growing never WILDEST dreams would thought US would slowly turn one dystopian books love much. Reading dystopia helluva lot different realizing living one. way goal. purpose CDC anything could defunded privatized. that's really right choice - rebuilding is.

Of course, want say whatsoever state. would certainly want people state contributing rebuilding. either lost health coverage due loss job, loss ACA, pre-existing condition (COVID-19). Millions going fucked next 10-20 years. I‚Äôve steady decided I‚Äôll wearing mask leave house. Screw getting sick anything communicable help it, y‚Äôknow? Yeah, hear you. people seem give fuck even start... individuals streets demanding right assemble rather remain quarantine. people throwing parties two months ago. 

Like, actually mental exhaustion never really good faith begin with? think big part absolutely well developed propaganda network, though, agree 100%. 

I understand worried people - people I've never met, even - like six months people acting like fake start. agree ""mental toll"" theory there... think absolutely factor today's behavior, majority it. 1. wear mask people it‚Äôs piece cloth ffs.

2. obligations ‚Äúfellow man woman‚Äù? Obviously I‚Äôm going pick defend rights ‚Äúobligation‚Äù randos. significant percentage mild/asymptomatic people long term irreparable damage? point research says this? I‚Äôm hard time finding it. Oh, guess haven‚Äôt heard shitshow [Texas‚Äô contact tracing almost appreciate people coming from, mentally. hate lectured, hate finger wagging, &amp; *loathe* told what's good. certainly hate wearing mask. 

But compromise society. know I'm smart enough disagree medical professionals. way see business like nightclub tell people wear certain types clothing another tell people wear mask. falls ""no shirt, shoes, service"" mantra businesses. cigarette smoking, phones theaters, etc.  wear N95 mother works nursing home, actually (small one, zero cases far). They‚Äôve briefed COVID looks like geriatric patients and, according her, it‚Äôs different.

I can‚Äôt remember all, think something along lines mild fever, similar signs dementia, general clumsiness (where wasn‚Äôt prior thing), things. problem is, spreads quickly within nursing homes become easily overwhelming. going forgo typical conventions thing looming. Now, way everyone acting, may stay away entirely least three years.  sure. country earth people squander advantages act willfully stupid United States. true, also deal pre-existing condition. anything, beaches reopening first time spike surprise me. full reopening bars corresponds spike made go - beaches problem, afterwards No. think I'm daft?

I want enforcement. want people reminded necessary. bought this, think included cold, flu, &amp; viruses stuff killed, duck would make killing Covid-19 reasonably likely. Careful stats, believe separate KC rest Jackson county. 

Also interesting note. Kansas staunchly Medicaid, Missouri bit better. Much higher nursing home population joco/wyco kcmo/jaco training Ironman got it. Regularly rode 40-60 miles, ran 8-10 miles, swam 1.5 3x week. Now, can‚Äôt walk stairs without running breath rest. Tested positive March 30th. Shit sucks. true facts control narrative. Hammering talking points works, that's use strategy. Hammer back. know kidding, case aren't, dinosaurs people never coexisted. sure already said, however, quote article ‚ÄúKahn believes huge healthcare expenditure burden individuals survived COVID-19‚Äù - makes even grateful NHS living US. Yes, it‚Äôs perfect extent, still cost us individuals result COVID-19 aren‚Äôt going impacted significantly long term financially individually medical bills covered healthcare system. 

Anyone wants sell highest bidder part ‚Äòdeal‚Äô certainly look back last months think twice. us working hardest even get 1200. Freedumb lmaoo I‚Äôm stealing Unless you‚Äôre gay... that‚Äôs still go... also know immunities conveyed coronaviruses last limited time, though typically 2-3 years. want people travel. 

Funerals limited attendance UK, local family limited numbers. Many people settle webcams. Actually we'd suspend constitution amend quickly sounds lot like deal bad Lyme infection years ago too. I‚Äôm disabled issues still present daily basis. fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, nerve damage...it‚Äôs kind eerie. Donated two weeks ago logged on! Negative. Back May paid $120 Quest told negative well (had bad flu start March went around health facility work). telling everyone know donate. realize consider others social group. 

It's really bad start painting others ""subhuman."" know that? 65 million people. 

If 10 percent got life threatening case that‚Äôs 6.5m.   Can‚Äôt stand seeing ppl don‚Äôt cover noses. national randomized study immunity still progress, source claiming % population immune trusted. multiple factors. 

One explanation people Georgia cautious due first. 

Here‚Äôs another thing people fail understand; virus places times. Risky behavior doesn‚Äôt equal infections virus wasn‚Äôt present! simply don‚Äôt know given time, plus additional factor random chance. Air filtration stop coronavirus cruise ships, stop coronavirus church. people gullible? trying downplay FL NY 3,500 cases day testing harder get. way people it. hope FL widespread testing enact restrictions equivalent NY. know NY though FL may already past that. dystopian quote... July 4th That‚Äôs dumb, it‚Äôs great. Well played lad. Health authorities said ""Majority people mild disease, even notice."" 

Yep. talk asymptomatic people supposed scare people wearing masks anyone could carrier, instead become excuse wear masks all. People like ""who cares get it, might even symptoms"" okay then, shall delete response well. Trump may loudest idiots, ton need apologize. Anyplace ordered people work ""essential"" protection plan even let alone implemented lose business license assets confiscated help repair damage caused. 

No reaching.  Forcing dig graves people die total disregard human beings would justice. Trump killing base People country wearing masks. data really strange. Reopening BLM protests explain disparity. thing think imported cases Latin America. People flying Brazil weeks ago FYI. don‚Äôt know air travel shutdown not. Latin America I‚Äôd likely go Miami Atlanta. Blood type apparently hugely contributing factor. Type documented suffering severe symptoms. Butt even doctors study say 100% totally touch rich people Idea real world like. lost job covid hit (business closed) looking work ever since cant find crap, last thing afford fucking vacation. Even get job going take recover financially this, things worry about; Rent, Vehicle insurance, vehicle keep health. would love live paycheck paycheck save could go trip. some, pay credit card. want, need, help moment struggle 6 months now. like lifeguard, see someone going past boundary, throw life line drop off, late,and drown. let‚Äôs see chart going back 2 weeks?  insane argument falls apart look high testing rates yet low cases deaths Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore etc. 

. assume nothing deal hospitalizations deaths? 40k people getting virus day still know little long term effects anyone (not severe Don‚Äôt argue Incels folks. What‚Äôs point arguing something that‚Äôs barely even hunan? COVID19 kill clotting blood triggering heart attack/strokes. strictly ARDS. Dr. Nick would good since outdoor transmission magnitudes lower indoor

I think know outdoors means transmission rate less 1% indoors. (which ""magnitudes"" suggets) Shit, I‚Äôm sorry recently read line researchers looking back satellite images Wuhan, China 2019, guess found? Unusually large numbers vehicles activity around hospitals Wuhan area beginning last August. lying timeline virus started. said December, think first cases back last summer. else would many cases quick. possible. may asymptomatic super spreaders travelling Europe U.S.. Look picture top article. people 6 feet apart, no, definitely farther apart seating arena.

Additionally, outside. Additionally, mostly wearing masks (like 80%). data appear provide evidence protests safer large indoor gatherings. political beliefs. hun, need get back entrepreneur! Btw, want go coffee hear *amazing* opportunity offer you? cousin Miami got sick day mother's day, May 10th. get results back May 24th. father Parkland told get tested contact recently tested positive person. Tuesday, get appointment Thursday, still results. 

The delay real gotta way worse think is. can't day results, we're gonna fucked while. someone presents one you, perfectly within rights ask see it, tear cut front them, tell get fuck store never come back. Yea shit- need dick- seriously. people‚Äôs lost multiple loved ones disease- maybe little nicer guys kidding think CCP better Trump. hate guy, throw people jail harvest organs stilll free post stuff like open Internet forum. Try China see happens. Big crowds = big spread communicable disease. That's almost whole country, hunkered two months. Well, reason people need jobs businesses running afford keep living. good reason medically, economically plenty reasons. Yeah, state way would qualify get test right said protest. 

(I haven‚Äôt, don‚Äôt need test. it‚Äôs way would qualify. aren‚Äôt available asking.) fact. deaths cases entire world, caucasians US Europe Italian strain covid.

. Taiwan still large gatherings restrictions. fo countries except NZ. concede New Zealand again, island fraction population US. nature island minimizes points entry, allowing easier management people coming country. large countries islands 100% managed COVID without social gathering restrictions? I‚Äôll wait. ü•Å intended way help people get paid *because businesses already forced close*. 

That different intended keep businesses closed. heard anyone say PPP loans intended keep businesses closed. would prefer designed way. weren't. snorted laughed loud still giggling (in manly way) type. Maybe [this simply face mask? Either way, would effective way get peoples attention make wear mask. Get tested yes paycheck still taxed federal government. would comparing 6 weeks change logic arguing upswing began 2 weeks ago caused increased testing? That's exactly chart disproves. assertion would require 5 extra cases example found 4 extra tests hit rate 100%. Makes sense. big part reason cases low lockdown. lockdown goes away, cases go up. Social distancing masks help ofc, reason, re-opening starts, people think it‚Äôs ok forget too. solid conclusion based absolute number cases among different races. risk exposure different people different countries population sizes different races also different. Man, fuck you. absolute dumpster. Same! Please send rescue, want want talk customers behaving badly, let's talk call centers. accept people behave nice manner absolutely cannot give want.

I quit job back February COVID though still China want risk 1000+ person call center everyone packed in, job going allow working home dealt health care enrollment. Lol. I‚Äôm centrist racist. Nice try though. media literally calls everything hate far-right racist. want keep guns. That‚Äôs it. Protesters smart people fighting legally stupid government. aware social distancing benefits PPE. stupid government open state's early stupid followers go without PPE. rocket science. accurate analysis. Explain GA nothing like FL TX even though first reopen. Florida vote sack shit suffering did, approve comment. Can‚Äôt believe county made news. It‚Äôs rough weeks here. lot( all) folks got tired physical distancing around Memorial Day. Half people stopped wearing masks inside stores, neighborhood huge barbecues backyards. neighbors twenty people last night. 
Scary part Rio grande valley tends unhealthy population. Lots heart disease diabetes. Starr county hospital also unequipped emergency. Aka people likely get tested, test positive reside countries whose governments somewhat transparent results. Yup. Agreed work rehab specifically Covid patients. months ventilator still struggling walk, go stairs remain oxygen. Others cognitive changes... literally every worst case scenario comes true yes would. they're trying eliminate ACA altogether.

Insurance companies must running scared. virus hides body like viruses emerges re-emerges later...imagine cost!!! again. Well, idiots charge 1 million dollar medical bill kick bucket, suffer it.

It's like ignore sign fall sink hole death, cause chaos days / weeks happens, happens. Ok. And? Lack competent leadership Facebook needs ban terror groups Sure, anything better nothing.

But understanding recommend mask wearing protect others yourself. like years. Proof? try hide facts World? Yes. deliberately try sabotage situation give zero fucks population like US? No. ‚ÄúDid great job‚Äù thousands thousands dead one worst infection rates curiosity, people wearing masks, general. contiuous ""bars parties people hair salon wear masks""?

I guess I'm sure even giant shitshow March/April, behavior alone brought spread. Im overweight diabetic 60 something guy. go back work I'm scared.  managed snag cotton, silk, water resistant exterior masks recently. came one size. size far large average female head/face. bought specific masks good composition, poor fit anyone smaller large-boned husband's face. thoroughly disappointed. Mask material important fit also. Drink bleach ? Thank you. hope doesn‚Äôt happen you, sucks. really hard. Life truly mystery. Thats ""let eat cake"" level touch. Yeah, what's concept using figurative language hyperbole reference anti-litter campaign current situation, amirite? Workers falsely identify business owners. know, morons.

I'll bet none freedom-lovers much bat eye disrobe hand electronics airport courthouse security checkpoints, yet wearing fabric across face bridge far.

How make sense something someone incoherent? It‚Äôs Mexicans necessarily. mentioned flights Brazil happening weeks ago. There‚Äôs something weird going GA first state reopen nowhere like FL. Hmm, wonder ethnicity MAGA-ites are... Experts SAID.

This never doubt, moronic GOP politicians Karen's/Chad's like act like big surprise. Insanity later. didn't. lot people AZ essentially ignored stay home order every chance could get. order lifted people acting like pandemic more. Grocery stores 3/4 full totally maskless people getting way close that. completely packed bars Phoenix metro allowed open up, table spacing anything close recommended. Nobody Mexico coming 2 weeks ago actually better CA, NM, AZ, TX. idiots refuse wear masks, go chance they're tired eating cooking. shit. Protests false also misinformation, awesome Everyone misunderstanding works. virus takes time build steam it‚Äôs called exponential growth. 

It‚Äôs like compound interest, explains Americans hard time understanding concept. 

Sure, first seems fine. let spiral control results unmistakeable. LOL  could ever feel anything disdain country? political reasons whatsoever flown American years. They've always terrible service, luggage, scheduling. I've flown Delta Alaska almost decade zero problems. Also yes, stupid can't even read holy text properly, let alone real life science proven eyes outright reject. RIP every life lost. testing returning 1% positives, they're good job testing. think 5% considered like, sweet spot? Nah commemorated event üéâemoji Discord. said me(minus flat earth part) used go youth church back day. first time ever questioned ""god"" figure. mean i‚Äôve seen articles said wearing mask 70% effective. article says outside could 19 times safer. 

couple two items makes sense lot transmission happened. wasn‚Äôt shoulder shoulder chanting either. many people would occupy random corners. nobody shoulder shoulder hours end turning tsunami I'm going hope least wear masks, knows. Jfc must retired - cursory glance comment history lololol looks like hours comment trash get downvoted hahaha you‚Äôre either pretty decent satirist troll actual sentient anal polyp üëçüèª there‚Äôs always tomorrow buddy Obesity -- 40% Americans I'm taking political stand I'm pointing interstate travel protected constitution. fundamental making colonies single nation.

Fuck man, I‚Äôm sorry.

I hope things get wayyyy better real fast. try nyc Chicago massive protest spike. Az texas bars open happened yesterday, Pence talking freedom speech assembly. sure ended quickly. 7th grade public school SCIENCE teacher tried teach us that, spoke tongues couple times. Glad see someone say this. CFS horrible. wouldn‚Äôt wish *most* enemies. Yes, get seriously injured driving work....

But chances...

Get panic mode guys, life living.

And yes life dangerous, deal it. not? wait another day? reading wait least 5 days get tested coming contact. tomorrow good saw Tuesday? canada got lot virus US originally, border restricted sharp pain, check pleuritis. fairly harmless indicative inflammation. sister marine biologist either agnostic atheist.

She expressed twice dinosaurs can't real ""it's kid stuff.""

She deny carbon dating, evolution (micro macro), studies kingdom/species tree thing, yet dinosaurs palpable her. even took entire class prehistoric aquatic life.

Sometimes rational people rational


(I'm musician, learned biologist, pardon misnaming scientific terms) symptoms. kidding. friend college developed CFS year graduated. completely ruined life. known beginning might given fact secondary attack rate virus pretty par influenza, something vaccines decent direct immunity population. It‚Äôs becoming quite possible sort cross-immunity corona viruses population, likely facilitated T-Cells Regular UI benefits. never understood ""it's flu"" argument facts plain see much worse flu. Flu typically kills anywhere 20,000-60,000 year US COVID-19 killed 128,152 counting year even close over. Expect death toll 200,000 end year US. high intensity UV that, use enclosed vents helpful person. 

I know years ago got one like system &amp; think claim somewhere like 95 99% kinds viruses like covid (cold, flu, probably coronaviruses, etc. although remember details). However, UV light blinding &amp; cause skin damage used reduce viruses HVAC system nothing air infected person floating around room leaves room.

AZ FL grabs Nov. base largely made people 60. Dead people don‚Äôt vote. don‚Äôt see afford protect them. I'm one things talking about.

I think free possible rights end interfere mine personally especially negative manner, saying think selfish definitely attack natural right life act brainless taking small steps stop much larger problem possibly put others danger that's asked put mask take extra step backwards other.

If argument absolutely need re-open think masks social distancing would easily implemented people despise bunch non-issue reasons. Well going NYC, 0.3% city died, estimated 15-25% city got infected. numbers, looking IFR less 1%, likely closer 2%. data covidtracking.com Worldometer. updated daily. see already got answer. wanted thank asking.

It intuitive. explanation spot on. depends long stay is...

what guilt Dubai Abu Dhabi, they'll fine $800 wear mask.

And, host party. fined $2,700, attendee pay $1,400.

Looks like works. think start 1 even infected end 80+ infected contaminated glasses would love invaded Canada. Norway. That‚Äôs bad :( 
I thinking recently CDC screwed saying people shouldn‚Äôt wear masks. concerned shortage president should‚Äôve enacted masks ppe manufactured. president administration blame this. media also role part downplaying seriousness virus. likely reddit hug death - it‚Äôs running weeks she‚Äôs never shy it. Especially since well understood average ~~person~~ *doctor*

FTFY ‚ÄúMillion dollar hospital bill‚Äù Add people complications. Imagine collective burden suffering. refrigerated trucks hold dead? guess every flu season, hear it. Source - Overcrowded Hospitals. people like that, unfortunately time people like like get stepped used. could probably suspend fire her, though. dad symptoms, went doctor, got test. test came back negative, doctor convinced false negative told act like quarantine. strange tests still inaccurate. know situation there, states (with crappy social safety net) poor ""no win"" situation. thing I'm worried companies pushing ""blanket immunity"" even provide basic preventative measures. 

Yesterday read group farm workers strike, get masks gloves.... world going hell hand-basket. also said wearing mask political statement him. Can‚Äôt decide stupid, evil both. amount death fine long whatever want. They‚Äôre pretty confident they‚Äôll okay, won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal. Unless one loved ones either dies it, simply racks crippling hospital debt it. look getting second opinion different doctor, sound completely like asthma (coming someone who's since toddler) Take allergy meds. wear mask. Came say this. community sat expecting influx new members, aa often triggered virus.

Bro, none people getting sleep, they're losing multiple patients per hour, every hour, often dramatically violently. Nobody's going take time look patient past month. They're still struggling find time pee.

Ho lee fuk truly know get tested. Please get done asap possible. ""I die, know dead people complaining about. They're probably making up."" It‚Äôs IQ thing different reason: IQ good measure intelligence. Terrible news. Please stay safe, India! Keep trying flatten curve it‚Äôs goes berserk like USA Brazil! think Aunt Jemima real grind hundred years since last pandemic. So, probably happen lifetimes. Get grip. Moving countries isn‚Äôt really ‚Äújust leave figure later‚Äù kind thing. 

It‚Äôs also quite expensive. 

I‚Äôm looking jump ship myself, planning traveling country back April plans got canceled. 

And handling virus, it‚Äôs going long time people let us theirs. Nope, option tax row? One last covid patients losing hands feet **treatment** virus breath tracheostomy now.

But, uh, he's one ICU success stories. ""beat virus"" all. think every time look recovery statistics. Paul Krugman (an American Nobel laureate economist) talked without containing virus economy recover even reopened.

Yeah don‚Äôt know people expect consumption-based service economy come roaring back life people scared death unnecessarily leaving homes sense? I've reading studies put fire staff eesshh...they provocative say least. someone give ELI5 people experience prolonged impact? damage cant recovered? vaccine help people? 25 year old, seen local level least older people fighting wearing masks. However, younger adults work typically high risk jobs. yeah, retired couple leave house 2x week mask less likely contract compared 20 year old cashier wearing mask works 30 hours week constantly exposed different people. I'm masks everyone, give millineals damn break blame game. ones know would love better safety standards. smoking shit ton weed. It‚Äôs already proven help lungs recover way CDC handled testing February, honestly want handling anything? shut one county California yesterday, think us stay county point? Unless let state automatically deduct taxes it.  really need start times collective mourning/remembrance. sad, breaks hearts. think exactly right. easy point towards bad eggs bars pool parties, real issue 18-25 year olds ones working food service retail. go back work. love people thread think anybody working hospitals conditions going mental capacity time make thoughtful, nuanced decisions triage based person's actions character.

Bro, none people getting sleep, they're losing multiple patients per hour, every hour, often dramatically violently. Nobody's going looking patient past month. triage standard complicated comparing two numbers, nobody's gonna it. likely need bring medical staff states like NYC. People also taking 40 inches even give inch. Yep, pro athlete could well career-ender. Holy cow got complacent. thought people choosing get tested meant need more. take account cases rise fewer people would want get tested.  mean *began* there's already people kicked flights refusing wear mask ""sheep."" too. extreme anxiety disorder I'm required go work (in restaurant uphold social distancing/masks). I'm anything avoid getting control point. starting think inevitable... posts bad things help like NEED look. like can't decide whether better worse know information posted here... keep paying low wage workers stay home might time get ideas unionize getting fucked life people see town hall videos screeching like banshees masks social distancing mainly middle aged people. think ones need take seriously need get local media station talk masks way we'll get thing continuity, economy, health. Technically HEPA filter capable filtering microns smaller virus. problem kill virus certainly solve problem person sitting next breathing virus directly face. says asking right? They're excluding told patient. Economy fucked either man. daily death daily case number ratios, worldwide, past 12 Fridays, starting April 10 ending yesterday (in percent):

8.0 -- 8.3 -- 6.3 -- 5.9 -- 5.8 -- 5.1 -- 4.3 -- 3.9 -- 3.8 -- 3.2 -- 2.8 -- 2.5

This nicely linear relationship since peak mid-April, 2.5 months ago.  True, covid right IFR going get better better treating it. 

Its becoming less less deadly, thanks modern medicine. still contributing 401k paycheck getting hours cut severely? !remind 52 weeks Obviously whiteys fault experience young people problem. work retail every person 40 ask mask does. Every single one. older males especially give trouble.  Man, read giving up. like yeah, lmao. Hey guys know human anus stretch 7 inches without damage. Really gives whole new meaning term fanny pack. Thanks! :) way going now. Can‚Äôt imagine 3 weeks way Desantis acting. don‚Äôt know would help entitlement. way people treat retail employees horrendous places. Oh well. Sorry 33,000!  That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve thinking about. assume since NYC Minnesota already hard hit, it‚Äôs harder virus spread people protesting already it. anecdotal. believe true peer reviewed study yet.

SARS closest thing, studied lasting complications. asthma hospitalized pneumonia twice younger. never fully recover lung infections. Don‚Äôt chance it, ain‚Äôt easy wheezy. pediatric audiologist. face mask schools thing going great preventing spread disease, idea significantly impact learning. guess that, could measured accurately, see 20-30% decrease amount ""learning"" (incidental, group, whole class) people, hearing impaired not, use visual 'speech reading' cues order better understand speech (we're often hearing 60-90% said, depending background noise room acoustics - already terrible schools). remove visual cues entirely, we're bad time. Wrapped enigma? Also headline/article makes sound like *everyone* gets COVID long term health effects

There‚Äôs literally way us know that, likelihood happening small (but surely possibility) posing one possibility. Know lots full time workers full part time schooling reading article stuff I‚Äôve heard Austin, think enough tests enough time manpower process all. heard sending Houston, people taking 5-7 days even get results back actually expected higher. thought entire world going go U.S./Brazil model. can't imagine anyone would. Shit pay, shit working conditions. FL? head story like county everything first shut down. IIRC got arrested released charges. nurse. told exempt rule must scary. People said would never 2nd lockdown it‚Äôs already starting $600/WK top regular unemployment payment starvation wage? disciples dont know clumsy god think omniscient almost died flu, get shot. I'll try anything sick again. sick scared after. idiot charge, parts South, especially, idiots way chain command... overwhelming majority wearing masks. protests, see anybody wearing masks, though people wearing improperly. absolutely love people know that's state anti-littering campaign slogan.

But yeah, would great, people would love it. Thank response. She‚Äôs getting tested tomorrow morning. don‚Äôt live rest family isn‚Äôt entering room she‚Äôs staying without mask. She‚Äôs currently pretty bedridden says every part body aches, even eyes, hasn‚Äôt sore throat time yet. spinal fluid leak back surgery first thing asked medicine stop vomiting. Fortunately ability/option lie flat would stop leak (and headache). *Russia entered chat* south you???

Especially someone says, ""I can't wait OVER!"" ain't *never* gonna over, people. that's I've scarcely left house since March -- unavoidable medical appointments.

Happily, I'm semi-retired, self-employed part-time, already working entirely home, deal demanding employer.  Buckle up, friends. This'll long one, lot fun.

Because society treats old people disabled people like garbage, country underexposed reality permanent bodily mental damage. Diseases lead severe, permanent disability‚Äî like polio‚Äî rare enough days society pretend freak anomalies common dying air crash.

We yet know COVID's going bring, know 40% SARS survivors‚Äî particular, healthcare workers Canada‚Äî unable resume careers. Keep mind we're talking high-demand field, country (unlike U.S.) workers actually rights protected discrimination. 

The raw percentage, COVID, likely somewhat lower insofar people get COVID-19 get mild infection; but, think reasonable assume that, get sick enough need hospitalization, good half unable get back work. Either get hired, they'll get gimp-tracked eventually fired bosses figure health problems.

I developed respiratory infection 2008 that, couple months, fucked breathing enough started panic attacks. infection curable, extremely mild compared hospitalizable COVID, brain like airflow trouble, learns panic attacks, tend keep coming.

These things fuck long time; keep fucking decades later. We're ignorant it, society sweeps people view whenever get old sick, real thing become *very* real thousands, millions, Americans.

Why saying this? predicted March would [4‚Äì16 million working-age Americans permanently disabled Feel free check math assumptions; hope I'm wrong. far, though, there's good chance range ends right.

I almost ""embarrassingly"" wrong, mean high order magnitude.

From mathematics standpoint, ignorance protests astounding. look death Franz Ferdinand kicking deaths millions silly cause many deaths, rightfully so. viewed similar light.

TBH I'm psycho GA numbers keep climbing looked yesterday said ""want visit restaurant one last time sinking ship goes under?"" went Taco Mac. crowded hell 2PM! figure it'll first last visit long while. Minority groups made disproportionate share cases almost everywhere America. symptom broken healthcare system. also want make point free state testing FL, limited number tests available. People want need get tested turned away day long. 

For example, Sarasota one 2 test sites, 750 tests available. center supposed open 9-5 day went closed 10 hit quota day. gone 2 previous days try already shut down. 

That means numbers would lot higher everyone wants could get tested.

And course numbers last week. people get tested today results recorded next week. get tested anything 2 weeks negative results. problem. Another reason like keep roof head, food belly, phone/TV/internet, another strong motivator.

It‚Äôs crazy people think means need reopen recklessly deaths worth save economy, means need restructure economy pandemic doesn‚Äôt force choice people starving going homeless working recklessly.

- actual total death toll COVID-19 likely higher number confirmed deaths ‚Äì due limited testing problems attribution cause death; difference reported confirmed deaths total deaths varies country
- COVID-19 deaths recorded may differ countries (e.g. countries may count hospital deaths, whilst others started include deaths homes)
- reported death figures given date necessarily show number new deaths day: due delays reporting. don't, wondered knew hiding? voting replies, idea reality shared mine, delusion. argued said ‚Äúif data would reported on‚Äù.

I feel disgusted attitude. way thinking rotting minds community. Selfish prick! still wish family/friends going safe. Open eyes try grasp current situattion protect people dear you. Looks like tests close 100% specificity. Like insatiable apetite braiiiins? can't 'have opinion' mortality rate, fact, atleast 6%, sure depends average that, really deadly, possibly million deaths already. Australia consider travel bubble wit New Zealand countries, maybe US go talks Brazil Sweden :D positive cases much younger back March, milder illnesses (due increased testing capacity). mortality rate much lower numbers saw March-April. seriously need understand psyche nuances Thai culture commenting. think know country locals speaks volumes person. According principles distributive justice, can't wait till actually ""run out"" beds/ventilators start refusing treatment people. 

Let's say example 1 free bed point pandemic presented 88 year old patient need ventilator, renal insufficiency, dementia history several myocardial infartictions left cardiac insufficiency. give bed person even available. do, might regret 30 min later 40 yo mother 4 prexisting conditions comes thru door scratching neck air. One patient 20% survival rate best case scenario going need months intensive care die less year things anyway. patient likely survive kids period weeks high chances recovering normal life. 

I wish easy ""first there, first served"". Oh wish it. doctors get easy. 

Distributive justice sucks individuals best collective. Yes Doesn‚Äôt say corona r/whoosh part see joke finally found people! diagnosed H1N1, year later diagnosed mono. young H1N1 realize severe was... spent 2 weeks straight stuck bed barely able breathe coughing. recovered, know someone didn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs permanently brain damaged, can‚Äôt drive can‚Äôt walk without cane. I‚Äôm scared case people time around. 

And people work still tell everyday virus isn‚Äôt even real... difficult leave abusive relationship...

Hopefully never put situation decide draw line sand take leap leave job. Poverty &amp; socioeconomic disparity directly linked health many ways. country race socioeconomic disparity go hand-in-hand due long history structural racism, see stuff like happen. 

Never forget US government‚Äôs response measly aid packages gradually attempting normalize death massive scale. it‚Äôs far - fact worst probably ahead us given continuing rise cases. Like Thai friend joked me, Thai people scared death anything.

Anyway joke aside, believe cohesive response pandemic. Thai news tend centerized narrowly focus topic month (even without cencership military junta). topic month Covid19, information put public make people high alert sort dictating public response certain way.

Even though superstitious lots religious freaks, come science would never go it. General narative science real people scientific field smart people know doing. junta maybe bad many things one let experts lead fight. also lucky sorted starting masks normal last 2-3 years due problem PM2.5 dust Bangkok area.

Also one procedure saw different Thailand say US UK Covid patients matter mild case stay get treated hospital state run facility clear. good way contain spread. Greeley here. Every fast food place, every cashier, every delivery driver I've seen masked. big thing makes feel safe Pizza Hut driver ***is*** recent knowledge masked help prevent catching Coronavirus. imagine bunch people

Shouldn't quarantine 2 weeks arent showing symptoms, contact someone who's infected? future mistake waiting happen Aren‚Äôt people always saying trust fake news media research?

Just wasn‚Äôt talking point major outlets doesn‚Äôt mean information wasn‚Äôt reasonably conclude data virus‚Äô impact collected ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases Covid. Everyone focusing people vents, people tested positive mild cough didn‚Äôt even get chest X-ray. 

But reports people ‚Äúfelt fine‚Äú permanent lung damage. blood clots. kidney failure.

I tried point disparity ‚Äúthe data‚Äù people experiencing got treated little bit like you‚Äôre treating now, even though evidence supports thesis. wonder many mental health paranoia problems sub caused Zionist hoax Ditto. test 20% false negative rate. realistic assume confirmed cases bad metric calculating death ratios. someone coughs sneezes face pandemic getting kicked nuts! people told serious take precautions. told take precautions, suddenly becomes attack them. people become utterly, stupidly self entitled, request something, even good brings Karen trapped inside. Stop scarig üò≠üò±üò¶üò∑üòê happening PA, imagine Florida ... perfectly fine touch food grocery store someone could grabbed put back coughed over. 

It viral load. odds someone coughing package putting back slim amount viruses package would small. 

The odds even slimmer pick package way actually get enough viruses hand put hand mouth amount time virus dies.

Purchase groceries, wash hands get home put away. time use next days, virus would dead. Even make sandwich right away get home, wash hands eat you‚Äôll fine. We've lied misled much trust anything telling us anymore.

We weren‚Äôt *lied* this.

The polar ice cap still melting y'know. There's debate I've heard, initial report apparently places takes China word scientists commented well spikes attach human cells.

All I'm saying looked China would problem sacrificing 100,000 people make look like ""shit happens"" event looks like could major turning point ongoing efforts dominate world's economy. Here‚Äôs full article anyone country founded. Huh Tests per capita relative metric, plenty countries testing well capcity due low amount cases. example country, Ireland, testing less 20% capacity positivity rate 0.5% last week. guy trying dance around bsl-4 virology lab wuhan china working university North Carolina chapel hill 5 years gain function research largely result. Thanks UNC! Go tarheels Didn‚Äôt see mention CFS article. Absolutely. ""hundreds thousands died China could stop virus"" thing baseless embarrassing - basically evidence anything like that. thousand extra deaths hidden/undocumented middle initial chaos Wuhan believable, much - impossible hide uncontrolled outbreak age satellite imagery social media. Myswell drink deal negative effects constsntly lol accused bot said people political persuasions stupid regards mask wearing. guess random person internet knows location better do. 

It fun bot though!! get live forever!! become confusion shock sweden zero covid deaths yesterday trending deaths weeks. Cases way deaths way way down. right Astonishing many people‚Äôs argument basically boils ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt care people.‚Äù Almost certain economic social philosophies romanticized self-absorbed zero sense social responsibility. We‚Äôre lying bed made, though perhaps it‚Äôs late learn. Remarkable progress ignoring downplaying pandemic. Perhaps perfect world, world far perfect. Money talks bullshit walks... I'm repeating Australian government come said, believe infections give positive test result within 11 days exposure.

They talking context testing returned people forced hotel quarantine (our country forcing people come country forced 2 week hotel quarantine). test people day 3, day 11, day 14 allowed go, provided test day 11 came back negative. way try get accurate results tests still allowing people leave hotel day 14 receiving results second test. situation sucks, consolation, case studies suggest resturants servers lower risk, always move spend long given individual. typical infection happen someone infection zone sick person extended amounts time. Avoid coworker much possible try find surgical mask, look YouTube videos fit mask properly, goal self-protection, mask worn without gaps significantly protective masks worn gaps mask face. Take care. tested positive Coronavirus, never fever one symptoms. lag infection positive test result officially tallied around 2 weeks average. Deaths tallied around 4 weeks infection. Morales Pipkin said, ‚ÄúWe currently 286 COVID-19 positive patients persons investigation hospitals across system. date, discharged 1,350 COVID-19 positive patients.‚Äù

To put number perspective, entirety St. Louis metropolitan region 217 people hospitalized corona today. people trying warn gain function research equip cleavage zones 4 animo acids would produce result. keep saying people understand flu cold. airborne aids. 42% covid deaths came .6% population (nursing homes). leaders. us Third. World. Country. many deaths? That‚Äôs matters. testing going mean cases.  possible running organization ~90% volunteers needing paid workers important safety. particularly disappointing many volunteers donors high risk categories, elderly, obese, diabetic. Sigh. Agreed, science needed. Certainly questions, please feel free ask! Spreading awareness condition important often misunderstood! i‚Äôm loving Colorado even usual lately. progressive political stance many issues seems bleeding crazy idea spread corona either. Let people safe weed try kill something else meantime! Love I‚Äôve wearing mask, social distancing, going essentials, still caught it. Sadly, fate rests idiots‚Äô hands. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsurvival fittest‚Äù virus 1-2 week latency period kill everyone else. fact immune system weak enough catch covid despite taking every precaution possible doesn‚Äôt mean deserve die. much complicated fatigued. Often autonomic nervous system dysfunction well make use stimulants unpredictable experience. pretty stark comparison think things previous generations - think WWII veterans drafted sent hellish conditions Europe Pacific, pretty good chance would never return. people something complain yet plenty faced fate resolve. 

And people getting undies knot asked wear bit fabric go public live regular old lives. one Thai people believes king country throughout entire epidemic? Ah okay. Apologies, comment isolation came across somewhat satisfied status quo. symptoms subside, long still contagious? 

I stopped feeling symptoms yesterday. around GF upcoming weekend? I'd like real name please confirm this

Lol, found insane person Mandatory mask usage don‚Äôt, people work literally trying get remind daily. thank u! This. self-centered mindset focussed individual freedoms.

Same way lot Americans believe universal healthcare, want pay \*other people's\* healthcare.

As Canadian, mind paying extra taxes do, end benefits myself/my family, everyone else society. Seems like many Americans much ""every man himself"". Nobody wants inconvenience sake bettering country. sad. Southern California counties really upset state shutting first place came way Sacramento protest it, demanding state open 100% believe COVID-19 real (and probably still don't) mingling likeminded locals well people Fresno. anti-vaxers decided join protesting protest vaccinations, also anything help mitigate spreading virus about.

It's surprising COVID gone everywhere state. insane since election still 4.5 months away. keep we're (the bare minimum) going blow kill many many people leave even severe lifelong issues. know wrestling fake, Covid-19 laying smackdown mankind HARD. million-person slum India pretty much definition poor sanitation, ability social distance, access PPE?

That‚Äôs objective fact.

Now name large country, island, restrictions large social gatherings? It‚Äôs yes question, I‚Äôm gonna assume ‚Äúno‚Äù. planning starting ""next season"" around Christmas finish ""this season"" end October thanks that. made really clear. explained it, can't believe never thought :)

You clearly don‚Äôt know word means Trumpers BLMers right tired them. dangerous, stay indoors except work. us ignorant. question though, there's vast group intelligent rocks. oppressed around world, then. sort negative outcomes tend higher black populations around world.

Lol close sort realization effect Colonialism Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade  possible. think forms narcissistic behavior. Collective societies also lot people think they're reason things falling apart. Self-important bureaucrats, health professionals, parents. might see role individual still think they're center it. true everywhere else, US. Yeah, bad... I'm 30's well, exactly best shape (ulcerative colitis cost colon) I'm still significantly worse before. 


And screwy thing symptoms even \*that\* bad... felt like crap around 4 days, fever 99.5... it. respiratory issues, high fever, overall mild case. 


I cough variant asthma since remember, never problem, hassle. Like get something lots dust pollen go coughing fit, always ""got it"" around 8 years ago seeing allergist dx'ed ""cough varient asthma"" like ""um, OK?"" Like even believe asthma... inhalers gave seemed stop coughing fits like light switch, glad them. 


But now, I'm asthma attacks regular, first time life... can't breathe them... scary fuck. 


Additionally even though never even cough before, occasional one kinda ""lingers"", occasionally I'll hack phlegm, occasionally it'll hard breathe, outta fraking blue. I'll chores used find completely outta breath, need sit ass way often before. 


It's 2 months already... I'm shit. wondering, 90s statewide last 6-7 days FL. Anyone holding onto theory, sorry pan out. ""Define this"" -someone probably specified NGL, -allegedly- bad reaction 2nd MMR vaccine. (I old enough remember wise enough know milking attention). grew horrible (as well misdiagnosed mistreated) ADHD. mother said always wondered contributed said would vaccinate anyway. Strangely enough never got chickenpox vaccine (I missed cutoff required year) told lady called asking ‚Äúshe already takes much medicine. don‚Äôt want give more.‚Äù sad? people wearing masks alone car. people think that's overkill. sure ""leadership."" anything, living NY, I'm annoyed lack leadership Cuomo stopped daily pressers well lockdown ended, good source information re-opening supposed happening we're going fix damage fall our, economic school system former Floridian RN, confirm Tampa Bay area hospitals already scrambling solutions converting resources. also immediate travel contracts available 3x instate RN would making. wearing mask they, sanitized shit car, go inside shop outside drop pick up. stay inside employees are. think I'm fine. 
 
If concerned tiny cases find free testing center Houston can't afford actual test. forward everyone that's walked grocery store Texas. ""contact"" same. sent email abundance caution, I'm abundance caution. cousin little bit older 38, ended catching covid April. ventilator ICU almost 2 weeks, stroke blood clots legs removed. gotten rehab facility still ton therapy do- barely take steps walker. Shit's scary. can't speak Mississippi, living FL I've seen: whole thing first blew people taking seriously part, much less traffic streets, people respecting social distancing space, state least moderate shutdown measures, things going right direction. 

Over time people seemed get bored distancing shutdown, cockgoblins protesting led things opening sooner have, people people look others establish - people starting venturing without masks easing social distancing measures started same, brought people out, established new right thing do. 

The news reporting passed peak, articles saying due summer heat virus effectively spread well, articles virus becoming less dangerous time, articles stating increase cases due testing even though cases ramping spread actually slowing, seeing everyone else apparently returning normal reinforced that, message seemed 'mission accomplished, beat it, going disappear stop careful'.

Plus, one wants person office store wearing mask, makes feel foolish, people stopped wearing masks public. 

Of course things surging everyone stopped precautions slowing things down. like stopping antibiotic regimen feel better instead taking pills directed - things looking good while, somehow forgot reason took seriously least period time. shortage unnecessary cruelty USofA. Hang there. Except not. They‚Äôre oppressed around world, then.

It‚Äôs almost like centuries exploitation dozen colonial powers causes worldwide patterns oppression. 

There‚Äôs genetic component everything, socioeconomic factors go way further. Access quality care, affordability, infrastructure, etc. going mean terms disease prognosis. protest Manhattan, walking avenues. Everyone mask. ‚ÄúThis study‚Äù

That first two words post Magnitude**S** means 1 order magnitude, smallest 2, 100x.  Uunless, apparently are, counting anything 1 plural. people haven‚Äôt taken serious probably never will. Never left Come Mississippi. bet percentage higher US 40k U.S. Postal Service bare stay afloat Congress saddle ridiculous pension payment obligations.  fault U.S. Congress president United States. That's exactly guy using 5G(ates) implant microchips humans track movements control actions thoughts behalf deep state would say. Blame China They've weird thing lately report number previous day, next day also updates it. simply cant operate 50% capacity.

Eh...

2 big things:

1. already paying rent level HVAC. labor rest utilities covered 50% capacity still better opening up.

2. living COVID world. WFH, A/B schedules bigger emphasis takeout likely result differing eating patterns. 3:00 dead zone? Maybe folks show early know gets full night. might still getting increased volume takeout orders. Maybe people show 9:00pm.

Now, said that, opening bars dumb shit. basically last entire thing antithesis social distancing. Thanks non condescending response seems hard get reddit days. Cheers. radical concept global powers interested self-preservation incentive accurately report actually happening. don‚Äôt know look America‚Äôs numbers, dead Chinese whistleblowers, monetary inability countries accurately test entirety populaces, believe what‚Äôs reported. opinion. ""Likely""? guarantee already led real deaths. lead many more. Yeah, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm sure

You trace dude wearing mask Walmart

Impressive Dang! Good one don‚Äôt even know... don‚Äôt want give wrong advice.

Call doctor ask advice. There's huge difference outdoors

Remember huge crowds Ozarks caused much consternation?

`No new COVID-19 cases Lake Ozarks crowds, Missouri health director 318 outbreaks China found transmission occurred out-of-doors masks huge (most protests high mask utilization)

`No cases coronavirus linked two Missouri hairstylists saw 140 clients last month symptomatic, county health officials said.`

`Both stylists worked Great Clips location Springfield. clients stylists wore face Jacksonville woman went bar June 6th 15 friends got one bar East Lansing response 85 baffles something like takes far time effort obtain take 3 seconds put fucking mask on. put reddit charge finding people don‚Äôt wear masks posted stupid shit freedoms. let die Guess time Saaaaame. govt must lying ass abroad. What's shitty right parents think covid US presidential election.... ask everyone tested positive went restaurants bars southern states?

Do idea fuck even arguing?

If one variable changes, variables stay relatively same, see huge change output, reasonably certain one variable responsible.

The variable changed lot cities protestors. output change. fact, cases still dropping Minnesota.

If need explain language 3rd grader, let know. I'll give shot. Yes no. biggest problem nursing home staff, without strict quarantine (which remotely realistic) Covid outbreaks. Rumors where? curious. Japan knew people would wear masks asked, importantly companies would demand people sick come work close proximity others use refusal reason fire reason cut benefits. area also meet lot fresh mainland China transplants way scoff state things here, like can't believe left China for... This.

Dafuq expecting? lmao America least See last line *Copyright 2020 NPR. see more, visit news sites license republish articles services NPR, Associated Press, on. No, definitely bad, mean Georgia going right direction, either. Gay bisexual men population affected HIV. Gay bisexual men accounted 69% HIV diagnoses United States 86% diagnoses among ""How many sexual partners last year?"" ""Have anal sex one person last year?""

Why get entire life story every person that's donating blood they're it? statistics clear, facts discriminatory, good policy fact based, is. Considering saw picture wedding today multiple people church, expect numbers go up! Oh, know people traveling Florida Michigan right now, headed back TN! Yay. sites. They're contact tracing tracking positive cases went not. entire reason? need see physiological one? think maybe looked at, unless want die needlessly. (Not trolling all, genuinely curious live country without mandatory masks lot ""but could possibly work!"" anti-mask sentiment.) 
What policy restaurants cafes wearing masks? take eat otherwise need on? Sysco sell masks? not, getting them? course. Genocide migrant laborers. Like US ü§î f gateway state? Whoever wrote seriously needs get checked concussion. Wow. desperately need rapid testing! Casino worker...are SEIU? so, talk union rep. explain Black Death lasted seven years. watch Japanese media, Jdramas/Anime character gets sick generally shown using face masks, people even wear fashion (in media social media tell)

I'm pretty sure wearing mask japan part culture young people told obese basically nothing worry about? think right word postponed, prevented. cure, hide flatten curve, area curve remains same. game delay, possible, make time possible cure. yes yes youre racist get people mask wearing, staying home, etc? What's hospitalization figures? testing thing... Don‚Äôt get it, people *tired*. SMH there's huge difference masked outdoors unmasked indoors.

orders magnitude difference risk.

`Both stylists worked Great Clips location Springfield. clients stylists wore face Jacksonville woman went bar June 6th 15 friends got one bar East Lansing response 85  great example racializing something actually multi-factorial. Idpol much fun people can't see way analyze information. done lockdown right actually ramped testing contact tracing process could actually reopening right second peak. Look Europe, South Korea, Canada, Australia. That‚Äôs result lockdown could much leadership (and citizens) country hadn‚Äôt dead set throwing progress garbage. article nothing protestors stood shoulder shoulder hours, sure shared 

people cannot march scream yell 12 hours straight summer. certainly marching, people frequently would walk around, get food, lay get rest, myriad activities. especially dodge police, many people constantly moving went many protests NYC. ones wearing masks goddamn cops. Everyone else complied eagerly accepted masks volunteers handing supplies every blocks. Protesters also social distanced vast majority marches whenever possible. I‚Äôd guess people followed guidelines since March, therefore low infection rate begin with. That‚Äôs happens you‚Äôre crowd empathetic people took time days carried risk police brutality march fucking long overdue social equality. billion dollars $1200 checks sent dead people despite many living people receiving it.

Yep, received payment wife's deceased grandfather passed away last year (she beneficiary, course sent way money sent super wealthy corporations making record profits years workers expense

This angered start. whole thing money grab people even need money. realize $2 trillion funds ""made available"" probably complicated understand, back envelope calculation money instead put ""basic income"" subsidy working (lower parts middle) class people affected, real quantities money per family (I think order $20k per family calculated, that's ignoring reduced payments people able still work amount income). would keep people satisfied, economy could generally function much better (no issues paying rent, etc). would come ""socialist.""

Topping off, wife small business started October last year. made profit yet, disqualified qualifying usable amount various stimulus monies made available.

The whole thing set hand money wealthy corporations fuck everyone else. strong, wouldn‚Äôt cases now. Countries like Vietnam Taiwan learned SARS trust China they‚Äôve gone two months without local case. One month 6^th Street bars began reopening chickens roosted. microcosm see Vegas' reopening, difference Vegas bar crowd carrying gift home every nook country. entire population city live in. 10% population Finland. tell restaurant open awhile (my place employment open almost month SD), employees seem lax cleaning procedure 2 weeks. one people truly follows procedure horrifies badly fallen priority most. 2022 merman could die people won‚Äôt wear masks, government woefully prepared this, negligently prepared this, healthcare system miserable taking care citizens properly, economy working small percentage people living here.

I hope pulls through. nothing lose telling supervisor and/or HR comfortable taking temps. Ask reassigned something else. 

Give employer chance accommodate you. agree, employers seem care - really, probably not. Everyone wants ""back normal"" months away fighting uphill battle denial. Ohio cases rising doubt suddenly stop. 

Take care stand ground. right ceded positive values (compassion, respect, curiosity, fairness, integrity, consistency, etc) left. display values decry ""leftist virture signalling"". wouldn‚Äôt surprised, coworkers friends swear got inexplicably sick around later months last year There‚Äôs lot ways look this. One it‚Äôs highly possible someone know it, either mild case misdiagnosed. Getting test hasn‚Äôt easy pandemic, especially first.

Another way look locked early enough keep spread getting control area, kept loved ones safe disease. Look places got control... Bodies stored freezer trucks trucked neighboring towns crematoriums can‚Äôt keep deaths.

In case, it‚Äôs little self centered say ‚Äúwell, since don‚Äôt know anyone it, must bad.‚Äù Maybe grateful. original comment all. chose respond own.

And responded response irrelevant people besides sub original comment prompted numerous remarks I‚Äôve seen them.

Which related response you. would expand position bring know may hard, please try self centered.

Do know conversations work? post recipe fried green tomatoes comment, ask ""What said,"" self-centered?

It seems like difficult time opinions countered. every opportunity respond way contributed discussion instead decided ignore sake ad hominem. Depending source, haven‚Äôt reached quite yet (because get different data). Worldmeters.info crossed milestone. say something appease stupid. like schools fall. enforce strict cleaning guidelines. Bullshit. misted spray applied stupid way. Idiot fr, clearly bad idea Hope best prepare worst. feels like needs repeated. often history people laugh statistics possibility long term effects came diseases like this? 

Like.. viruses potential really damage long term. Like, get mono unlucky might get complication form cancer autoimmune disease. People often forget things arent black white strike...it deadly.  idiots say human race got wearing masks etc.

Humans today's health advice medical professionals science. internet human races downfall every idiot thinks Google answer means expert. live someone who‚Äôs risk. understand. quit second job second job put risk roommate risk. lockdown didn‚Äôt shit really. bought everyone time load sanitizer masks ventilators.... important. don‚Äôt believe another lockdown solution. need protect vulnerable. Unlike first lockdown totally fucked nursing home patients Wasn‚Äôt already widely accepted Japan wear masks public? seem good hygiene down. imagine helps.

Americans need told wash hands cover mouth coughing like it‚Äôs all-new inconvenient chore. went bar yesterday friend's birthday felt worried, nobody continuously wearing mask unless bar ordering drink. social distancing all. literally another night lol want go wanted good friend, I'm super anxious hour half spent bar cause literally nobody following kind guidelines 

We fucked. Ah yes, right back March then. Let‚Äôs play giant fucking guessing game especially area continues explode. 

A certain big orange jackass really wasn‚Äôt kidding said ‚ÄúSlow testing!‚Äù he? 100% calling right now, it‚Äôs awful decision backfire hard Austin‚Äôs face virus particles look like langoliers article photo. Yeah fuck blm chinese person, feel somewhat indirectly responsible deaths. RIP. work major university/teaching hospital Orange County. float pool, sent designated Covid Tele Unit lot recently many nurses gotten sick staffing super short. 5 straight shifts, least 2 rapids called 1-2 ICU transfers per day 5 days worked there. basically trading patients ICU bed freed up. ICU capacity, patients flighted out. Really odd. Vitamin levels seem predict severity extent, people nursing homes real risk reason.

I suspect they'll find stack sub-strains swarming around well. think they've identified 3 ? may well more.... Interesting. like cut jib. course, would need assist people whose livelihoods business, concession. pandemic, obviously going many job opportunities help people transition. like passionate ideas, compassion, plan. wouldn't, perhaps, want run president? Ahahajajajajja course, know tomorrow's gonna bring. Money lives apparently 30s old Good point.

Also - really concerned preserving rights? people say they're concerned rights, they're usually actually concerned denying people rights. Yeah fucking obscenity tipped based income really coming light 

-vet bartender/waitron ""That‚Äôs sad way looking things also misguided, look people affected previous pandemics see we‚Äôve learned past use knowledge fight one.""

ok.

""It‚Äôs reduce services, mandated government people getting sick weren‚Äôt enough staff."" 

Yes 2 weeks ilness back saddle. services reduced people ill? Big deal. lockdown 2 weeks come on.

""Pandemics past brought place massive societal changes amount people died ill. claim spanish flu brought end WWI people sick fight. long range view (of like 100s years) might seem like good things, ground, living it, it‚Äôs awful.""

Spanish flu? sorry way fair comparison. Spanish flu threat far severe.

""These measures place take away civil liberties""

They however limit civil liberties indefinitely completely unacceptable half society. care intended, road hell paved good intentions. subjugated indefinite civil liberty repression miracle vaccination shows up. accept it. follow orwellian rules indefinitely. Throw jail want, want live normal life.

""but protect you"" 

I sorry prefer state act mom dad nanny. need protection threat insignificant. also going ban alcohol need protection? like risk, keeps life fun dull grey bland mess days inevitably die. let's face it, 80 years worms eating remainder eyes sockets. ban cars? Far dangerous covid19 demographically speaking.

""The thing taking away civil liberties messages convinced act self interest put others harms way sake money.""

Money? Really? want live normal life without unnecessary protection marginal safety risk. saying conviction curbing limiting freedom frankly bit insulting. think stupid, easily misled nonsensical statements? Rephrasing liberty? want businesses sacrificed, people's livelyhoods destroyed global famine busy minor threat. ultimately big threat.

""Yours families lives health worth that""

I danger, life indeed worth that. joy get life worth small risk threatening me. family, scared death perpetual denial. pushing mere thought far away possible. live, obsessed maximum security maximal misery.

Can stop reframing? fall it, reasonably versed retoric argumentation theory. contributing discussion.

My parents adults denial mortality. updated went lives caring every risk might get them. would you? prefer literal black mirror episode.
Or adult thing cower threats? prefer saddle up.

Even grandmother gets miserable societal dystopia.

I prefer virus entire family everyone know.
We scared minor risks enjoy lives. go fun one day die. Life minimizing risk making rational risk benefit analysis adhering extremely low risk tolerance state.

If parents die covid?

Terrible, less terrible getting eventually yes everyone let's honest, vaccination take long.

Atleast got enjoy lives ended casket die alone hospital shielded everyone love.

I want free. social distancing never goes away please tell hang myself. Let repeat that: society actually indefinite would rather kill myself. much hate it. understand much happiness utility family derived off? much us wake morning feel day could easily robbed us without incurring loss.

Because people easily scared death, sacrifice people's hapiness utility ease maximum safety feeling safety.

I sorry blunt cynical miserable new normal. battling suicidal thoughts healthy young adult enjoying life vigor before. thoughts stopped country slowly throwing hysteria realizing worth all.  hope helps. Hey I‚Äôm glad get vote groaner. I'm fucking amazed dine all. 

NY take since march started street side tables. 

If there's anybody outdoor dining LA. year round good weather. Thread count certainly equal better. High thread count cotton fabrics electrostatic charge shown better filtration..fit important there.

When described fit, much non-scientifcally likening home fit test actual fit tests. great, sorry. :P talking mask allow air outside part. something along lines fit may perfect intake super strained come far (oh hi social distancing!). super bullshit ad hoc here, we're talking difference ... cloth sealing face (in large face case, actually surprising large mask deflation inbreaths vs me) vs gigantic gaps sides chin (fuck weak chin) leading significant/distant inward mask leakage vs minimal/very close leakage. worries Thanks dumb guys always number 1. üôÑüò≠ freedums! NYC here, many protestors wore masks. real spike all. mind sharing age health? Many, many millions deaths. EASILY.

Even suspect true numbers overall cases &amp; deaths 10x what's officially stated. already suicides workers trapped without pay cruise ships. stress must unbearable. Probably others that‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen reported. (Except doctors jumping windows Russia. /s) guess ...masks. States opened vocal anti mask people. believe mask doesn‚Äôt help open get spikes. Protests states strong support masks likely saw lesser impact find hard believe none. NYC everyone, except lot cops, masks protests. Obviously see color, reason there's police they're white women data yet. Says article impacts unclear best thing could happen US Trump catch covid. followers would finally see gravity situation. small sacrifice would save thousands lives. I'd believe seeing husband's coworkers going lot sending snaps eating/ drinking know now. Me, husband 9 month old daughter . protests must continue! Looks like comment aged really badly hanging hats this? way keep economy open keep spread down. Even Dick Cheney pro mask. plenty red/blue wedge issues; pick one those. Thanks. Take care. hospital recently Texas I'm even sure proper PPE. looked lime doctors nurses wearing multiple mask. ""They wooly mammoth skeletons jigsawed together"" heard. Oh pinpoint you. Check back Tucker Carlsons show. first time started talking economic damage need reopen. Right there. day reversed position virus serious 65. say age experience severe illness. There‚Äôs much don‚Äôt know Id rather say don‚Äôt know terror March virus made way Europe, India, America; considered bailing cozy little multimillion dollar bunkers. give month start retesting everyone again. wait see _those_ numbers. missed this, provide link check out? good see nobody buying shit narrative Reddit pushing. make common sense. bday plan sounds amazing. Thanks good head shoulders. race it? Guidelines laws. Nah movies popular TV shows Reddit hates lol, they‚Äòve U.S too, mostly school travel, impression rather simple. Plus us easy understand, still ridiculous wearing mask become political thing. meant there‚Äôs chance get job back finding different job things starting open up. lot benefited financially unemployment funds. really like 24% us. Everyone else board. Terrible. major retailer foodstuffs (HEB) reversed protocols 3 weeks ago. longer requiring masks. HEB that, everyone said fuckkkkkittt. People business look HEB guidance.

They allowed strip clubs bars reopen. Countless bars cited cause cases. club used work 10 people get it. closed 2 weeks going reopen thank God closed bars again. 

Our local BDSM community dealing couple event hosts insisting hosting parties. Saying ""we temp checks require masks, remove inside"" totally fucking useless. Thank God cancelled one event quadrupled hard many people asked to. us educated warned them, many us illnesses make us risk felt like big fuck cancelled. People arguing able kinky shit pandemic right. fucking stupid. 

Many people gas stations, stores, restaurants dining in, wearing masks. 

The amount people dining obscene. go San Antonio reddit, see pages people listing restaurants cases. Mainly areas median income one adult enough buy fancy house gated community, fancy car two. Rich people need olive garden evidently. 

There's also massive spike college age kids going bars. 

We seen spike areas population older, multigenerational households.

I live area adults 28 40, 65+. Youngish middle class homeowners elderly. want fucking survive. 

So wearing masks happening shit, staying home either. Oh yeah, seen recent articles churches/choirs mass spreader events lot early ones. funerals/the choir practice Seattle/etc. Singing seems really bad. SARS MERS fatality rates much higher. H1N1 probably closer comparison. goal never stop deaths. goal, plenty causes fight would far productive. Straw man fallacy. never claimed infections.

I said significant spike cases.

And DEFINITELY even close primary cause 47,000+ new cases mostly Southern states yesterday.

Learn read. know what's hard advising protests (for obvious reasons) giving guidelines protest safely.

And yet, opinion comes now. opinion 'anti-lockdown' protests going beaches? decried sub many news outlets irresponsible dangerous. *I'm cancer patient*, actual fuck moron thinking? know stranger internet never meet real life. extremely angry reading started crying little bit. hope grandma gets better. screenshot it, link screenshot. always knew could Florida! terrified now? last three months things gotten better. terror March? governors best could. Reich Wing Nut media decided early turn another culture war bear lot responsibility people taking seriously enough. current administration well republican leadership house senate states got line held responsible state country now. Sadly Idiocracy taken hold I‚Äôm afraid saving country itself. friend lives outside San Antonio keeps posting FB it‚Äôs big hoax hospitals aren‚Äôt filled. Posting pictures n he‚Äôs happy everywhere goes doesn‚Äôt require masks. 
We‚Äôre trouble... Idiotizing numbers would eventually decrease. always increase decreasing. one lib florida another, offer alligator claw stick, scratch back with. Maybe use hands arms, encourage people stay fuck away us. :) 2.3M 1.5M media trying sell ""going protests spread COVID-19"" extremely insulting common sense intelligence.

Floyd died 1 month ago (on May 25th). Protest going since then. Before, doctors said would take minimum two weeks see effects self-isolation failed isolation.

Guess what? Protests = failed isolation RECORD SETTING cases/deaths we're seeing today time-appropriate exposures 1 month ago. keep reading kind sentence multiple platforms breaks damn heart time person saying message. I'm 25 job parents. Idk keep staying inside wearing mask go public. Im scared. Fathers last birthday. don‚Äôt know say system then, it‚Äôs utter joke. Hey. I‚Äôve sick since early January. Counted Covid didn‚Äôt think could last long. ENT specialist. There‚Äôs soreness nose/throat area, headaches, tiredness. sounds like severe symptoms think sounds similar yours? Meaning certain portion clients gonna richer other? Get better. liberal psychotropic drugs They're even going farce checking temperature hotel resorts. worried buy thermometer gift store wait get disney springs (the glorified mall) coming contact everyone bus. No.
There treatment real condition, it. disabling. Massive group gatherings = spread COVID. That‚Äôs it. can‚Äôt argue that. Protest aren‚Äôt exempt. realize restaurant owners aren‚Äôt wealthy right? 

Comparing big oil companies absolutely ludicrous That's incredibly kind. Thank you. weeks ago. would felt terrible making friends go (we usually dinner, drinks), one get super sick, pass someone love that's older, person die. 

I hope good birthday! baked cake too, turned disgusting, hey, least kill anyone.  sad milestone world. afraid anywhere near end. They‚Äôre work page? Trump, ""is challenge?"" Oh damn. Yep. 5 different antibiotics. reading FB comments San Antonio news release today's numbers.  hope slow down.  overwhelming majority feel strongly real threat.  enlightening depressing. peer reviewed scientific evidence get sick recover long-term immunity? answer wrong.

The ""whistleblower"" doctor talking eye doctor. see increased deaths discover anything. saw internal documents, told friends, friends leaked it. friends went police station, signed NDA, left without incident. arrested fired. suggest American doctors leak hospital's internal documents see still keep job. America big. Even IF, that‚Äôs big if, lockdowns work. I‚Äôm saying isolation doesn‚Äôt help contain disease. think it‚Äôs delaying inevitable bad seasonal illness. Even states rules insane. Chicago far different worlds get yet blanketed rules. 

Those poorer Countries following ours, Europe, chinas lead it‚Äôs going kill millions kids... virus kills majority old people. kids life worth elderly. Yooyer probably better mask hurts significantly shrinks/inflates apparent significant leaks. Wet us bad. neck woods summer, humidity insanely high (Montreal), change masks accordingly. seriously know shit sure act according knowledge I'm house, alongside curbside pickup wherever possible staying fuck home part. Sure, Canada day celebrations weekend/week. cancelled. Bars, restaurants, etc open, I'm still staying fuck away. I've picking functional last 4 years I've getting US Government. I'm getting lot comments support you, Brawndo man. leg race, hate much leave? basically saying, zero imagination, need see dead bodies order follow rules. Yeah. talk old people disease, enough 65 succumbing well. 65 types still working grandma mom dad too. mean?? overnight nursing home $12.50/hour? got CFS/ME shingles. left completely unable work basic daily functioning like cooking meals. shit joke... It‚Äôs ‚Äúsurging‚Äù Atlanta. get transplant? fucking sorry. Genuinely, words situation. horrifying I'm disgusted one deal with. facing kind choice. know studies, 1 HIV+ pt I've seen covid well go work lose apartment wat form permanent lung damage ignoring cities huge jumps.

if protests primary cause increase cases running rampant Seattle, NYC, DC, Philly flat.

So clearly something else play. bigger likely accurate conclusion big crowds helpful COVID prevention, making point protests looks politically-motivated also people crowding together without masks bars, restaurants house parties/gatherings. No, far it. terrible name creates confusion, suffered years under-funding, widely accepted reputable medical circles -- NIH, JAMA, Stanford, Harvard, etc, etc real neuroendocrine Dr. Fauci-equivalent NIH branch deals CFS began sounding alarm back March concerns COVID-19 appreciably grow numbers CFS patient population. sad stuff. That's still early. effects BLM COVID still couple weeks away Luckily large gathering. What's funny I'm getting lot comments like defending Camacho one defending actual president. üòÇ valid example among countless others. Makes heart hurt. Viruses joke. got shingles 30. I'm 31 doctors pretty sure got CFS/ME shingles, I'm honestly disabled. can't work. barely leave bed make meals clean. cases COVID month wear mask, I'm gonna risk fucking around virus. Uhh Canada, fuck?? Talking shit US poorly handling this, left STRIP CLUBS OPEN??? Even state Petri dishes closed. Murica, home ""Fuck You, got mine"" mindset. Good job Italy! wish ancestors never left you. Woah, I'm experiencing allergy/sinus symptoms, get tested? they're testing /s read somewhere that, China, traced lot cases back one restaurant viral droplets circulated air conditioner. even people theoretically maintaining distance, wouldn‚Äôt mattered. doubt it. know coming, believe age range lower deadly, feel like we've learned treat virus last months. Glad still share story. learned February whole cruise ship got infected sharing air. Nature paper March. 3 months prepare learning NE, throw away I‚Äôm sorry hear grandma, wondering wore mask? Chicago coronavirus cases young people grow noticeably recent weeks

The problem many cohorts make ""young people."" people irresponsibly partying, packing bars beaches going spring break? Also ""young people"" part. making 100k year server. guess I‚Äôll easily find another industry pay fine dining serving experience... Shh...don't tell Alex Brenson...he's convinced Arizona double counting patients drop (now error) proof that. There‚Äôs definitive list isn‚Äôt compliance. it‚Äôs restaurant takeout delivery 3 page social distancing protocol called Appendix posted entrance. required since April 15th. don‚Äôt they‚Äôve either reopened, started offering dine-in, they‚Äôre clueless (usually latter).

If they‚Äôre dine-in replaced Appendix Appendix I. 7 pages. they‚Äôve posted together one stack touch see pages, think it‚Äôs important. 7 pages spread see them, it‚Äôs least minor indicator think it‚Äôs worth wall/window space. also sign telling customers stay home sick, wear masks, keep 6 feet apart, wash hands, socialize they‚Äôre done eating. obvious signs include: servers wear face shields addition cloth face coverings, soda fountains taken service operated employees, tables spaced provide proper spacing guests different tables (there specific layouts, 6 feet general rule), people removing dirty dishes tables wearing gloves, capacity 60% (50% bars), NOTHING pre-set tables customers sat (if are, ask new ones). you‚Äôve started eating none cups/utensils refilled. given new glass time. means refilling water glasses pitcher, absolutely refill dirty glass fountain. requirements, would readily apparent public.

You‚Äôre really going able tell they‚Äôre compliant learning rules going person see. you‚Äôre ordering delivery, good luck.

Additionally, see businesses compliance PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell us. go investigate complaint give 24 hours comply. don‚Äôt comply next day, office hearing higher up, go third time they‚Äôre still compliant get closed 7 days. vast majority restaurants comply rather get closed down, goal.

You file complaints here: type complaint select COVID-19 related. Glad hear still us, agreed it‚Äôs shit disease. Really hit home parents entered room full PPE gear. around 15 time; feeling pretty much invincible. humbling. Protect yourselves, wear mask. Imagine afraid mortality allow affect day day life dramatically cripple world economy. ""May never fully recover."" That's load BS. Humanity civilization package deal. always recover long humans. Humans like flu always flu season. Can't get rid even tried. Unless literally destroyed planet course. Jesus wept, people see world absolutes...

No, enough people course life, month two still sociable without proximity people. know, like lock-down something. port-o-potties scattered along road handwashing stations halfway line. Went past Wednesday supportive care anyway. dying covid doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt severely maim you. Loss lung function. Neurological damage. What? like Fourth July every night neighborhood since Memorial day. public health US fuckin laughable... powerful country world one least prepared healthcare systems pandemic. Pathetic I‚Äôm trying get sick.  10% gross. church went growing reminded us times 10% earned taxes.  poor payroll taxes largest share tax burden, gross vs net make big difference. Hold on, *again*? open right now?? FFS. blame protests, somehow.  Everybody causes progress

Current politics proves that's false. entropy argument saying since we're moving we're progressing nonsense. active participants progress. Work make things better, work believed 100 billion humans ever lived

And I've done work make lives better millions. opened early little precautions, friend working security casino jokes terrified. $127 million regardless results? Seems like quite gamble. things likes common? depends work. 

it's clear difference transmission door indoor masked vs maskless. respiratory transmitted disease. 

If Trump held outdoor rally masks might actually considered much safer instead indoors. Typical 2-14 days, average 6 days.

13 minute mark  Dr John Campbell everyday. casinos...

Durant second isint article says That's nice say, countries like Japan South Korea massively better controls situations far compliant populations, spiked soon talked opening up. Even northern Europe, controlled virus much harder much tighter much longer they're opening countries things control. 

It's easy see examples around world see absolutely awful Ontario Quebec are. also easy see exactly bad US currently feel secure. big takeaway -- better US lagging behind world virus control good management -- hope people paying attention. 

This comes research economists health professionals said reopen sure close again, Ford saying open close -- experts smarter politicians advising thing, thing make people happy reckless wrong ""best"" stay in, staying friends. Straw man fallacy. never claimed infections.


and yet asked question 4 times refused answer

i simply said caused infections, took issue I‚Äôm pretty much half way agreeing you...

The videos definitely fake due political propaganda, also believe many, many covid deaths actually happened. Whether personally seen not, feel like lot lives lost. However, may correct videos.

In conclusion, believe ask funeral home operator New York overwhelmed early stages pandemic, majority would say yes. videos fake lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Amazing people spend lives poor never thought go job executive team. wonder doesn‚Äôt occur them.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Reality often disappointing. want numbers go down. want wrong. never life doomed. laughing February thought friend silly telling us start taking seriously. People know died this. scared people love people people love needlessly die. 

I watching every single day hoping numbers drop friends eating good time laugh me. Make end joke! would love wrong. talking mean attacked twitter. morning mean 2am. nothing politics specific dynamics virus transmits.

This even matter nuance. outdoors wearing mask, rate transmission much lower. could even argue indoors wearing mask makes huge difference. There's reason SK, Japan, Taiwan low cases despite countries heavily use mass transit undergo severe lockdowns. 

South Korea even continued filming shows music videos done indoors. Mask usage fundamentally works. China literally building hospitals ground zero welding people homes. probably thought world wouldnt listen showed us instead still ignored them. Holy shit. bruhhh hell wants go Disney time? ICU modeling? people also restaurant employees washing hands using bathroom? People antimask protest downtown Houston today, make I‚Äôm gonna go limb say lockdowns imposed CCP *not* made good faith; control. Well that‚Äôs half battle right there! :) Yes [notoriously rural town Los Angeles, Everything political. People tend call political anything agree with. 

Maybe want say every body tries put spin agendas.

Also, protests political nature. I‚Äôm line cook work smack dab middle downtown LA. gotta say, still don‚Äôt exactly feel safe despite getting temperature taken door, wearing mask, washing hands every time change gloves sanitizing station every 30 minutes. feel like reopened soon. downvoted ? don‚Äôt get , make valid point flawed thinking. You‚Äôre comparing deaths virus deaths wars. point definitely taken serious wouldn‚Äôt make sense compare something like heart disease cancer kills 600k year? You‚Äôre gonna way. Enjoy music. subreddit leftist agenda. surprise something like posted Everyone wore masks China, still... Florida added 9,500 NEW CASES yesterday &amp; Oregon hitting high marks new cases- yet media focused five new cases believed could link house party there!!!

They seem think five cases representative 5,000-10,000 media trying hard blame new cases people ignoring lockdown rules, show maybe 1% new cases due parties reopened bars. respect idealism. maybe almost used such. It‚Äôs way entirety human history. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything personally navigate best ability. IKR. Sheesh. Thank Mean that's kinda whole things work. options would think available? People talking problem someone else. weird. spoken anyone seems think personal threat them.

That, plague could care less about, whosever good lungs air circulation plague find spreads goals, requirements A- Fiji. trying encourage it. overload healthcare systems killing people would otherwise dead, including pneumonia-related deaths count likely lead overcounting.

I agree overloaded ICUs result higher death rates illnesses, that's definitely bad thing counted result pandemic. People afraid seek medical care, unable obtain care means deaths, would consider ""overcounting"". people dead could've contained disease earlier. would think so. Sadly family east west Texas, isn‚Äôt remotely alarming friends. still think Trump Abbott great, it‚Äôs law close churches, 5G, Bill Gates, blah blah blah. people use every excuse book connect Trump.

You people desperate virus Walking Dead situation actually pathetic. 

Yeah serious, yeah may long term damage. needs said. need go hypotheticals act like every person gets virus destined bedridden rest lives. park center downtown used every single day.

What demographics getting infected?

What percent asymptomatic? Mild symptoms? Serious symptoms?

But no, get none worthless articles, videos, ‚Äúreports‚Äù except case counts context ominous words thrown good measure. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating mainstream news outlets provide nothing case counts context. clear agenda push, simpleton news reports like ‚ÄúCase counts rise AZ nothing! OMG! Get easy clicks. mind boggling everyone sub still circle jerks doom gloom one another rising case counts. manlet. People acting business usual.. little careful many about.

Because probably know full it, else equivocating?

Give false line reasoning. true. backing whatsoever, offered nothing value discussion vague statements handily dressed like average person's viewpoint purpose nothing muddying waters.

Delete account go back whatever firm hired tell failed. got wicked headaches spinal tap - nothing compared meningitis headaches. started dex right around spinal tap, traded one two totally different experiences. 

There nothing evil spinal tap headache. strong basic headache came movement, long stayed bed watching TV big deal. Ate door dash bed. Caffeine helped. Took power naps. keep head heart level, myself.

The meningitis headaches sinister. felt like major arteries head neck choked would pop, blood going shoot ears like fire hydrant. blood pain headache. Trying sit walk made heart pound head would fishbowl like going faint. felt like running time stroke something terrible, came awful sense metabolic poisoning impending doom. Plus hallucinations, numbness, tons weird neuro issues.

I felt 0/10 fear life spinal tap headache 10/10 meningitis headache.

One headache one Satan twisting knives arteries. opposite mask. know ignorant, myopic egocentric mentality come back bite ass infection becomes bad? Economically, shooting foot long term. Oh right, ignorant, myopic, egocentric thought hard deep. Cause many cases. Awesome! I‚Äôm similar position. work construction want better/easier job. thinking software development type, trying figure type schooling best. many people seem care. numbers insane, within span 6 months. know it‚Äôs really like 8 months since it‚Äôs traced back early December possibly even November 6 months global knowledge. Either way, less year, still first wave ways vaccine. None North Korea 

They best...clearly I'm Georgia able get tested without showing symptoms within hour finding family member saw tested positive. call local clinic told come get tested. reap sow, morons. Got viral meningitis 7 months ago due West Nile Virus. 44 best shape life. 3 months went away, return month later. know going through, frustrating constantly dizzy, off-balance, etc doctors shrug say ""it probably go away"" ""come back 3 months see me"", etc. Dude need fixed, like now. talking India. many stupidity US. cases 500k. near low. sister threw party last week. Group texted invitations whole family. Promised would ""socially distanced"" jus close family friends. called asked going come. said, ""hell no"" laughed. tell fool throwing party. need dick. knew would stop her.

So week later, sister, mother, cousin sick virus. father, aunt, another cousin waiting test results. sister wracked guilt I'm kind worried sanity.

The anger thought would feel scenario sunk yet. feel numbness prospect might lose family members next couple weeks. stupid party. viral load plays role too. read study said likely case asymptomatic people body able kill infected cells spread, still test positive contagious. important note: seeing today happened five seven days ago average due lag exposure symptoms aka incubation rate. whatever today won‚Äôt stop growth week probably two.  I'm stalin wanting people go back work? Greed kills, look America, imploding, designed Chinese know ignorant, stupid, greedy immature American public lauging. 100s thousands Americans perish. win America, laughing stock. one sympathy. worse that. 

They openly admit lied need masks general population wanted preserve stock healthcare workers.

 I'm blown away people dining indoors bar hopping. 

That freaking crazy.  Maybe get people comply orders others contact virus.  Yeah totally incompetent. least there's agree on. problem people obsessed trying control every aspect lives react worst ways something know anything about. Especially fear it. Without backflow presenter bidet could become filled backflow sewer water bidet would splash backside sewer water bowl. think Bill Gates. Gotta blame Chyna warning US again. Appreciate reply.... rational expectation warning. I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt source claim ‚Äújailed everyone‚Äù
So it‚Äôs misinformation Look Mr. Blissful Ignorance here. I'll 0.000000000002 ms. üòÑ I'm thinking reduced hours finding different gig winter/until treatment. I'm really conflicted going back.

Is shop good masking distancing least? I'm 33 currently working retail. Really liking I'm reading here. agree. But, restructuring health care would first priority. Another factor things bad US get mentioned much way providing easy/affordable access preventative health care. Americans get sick COVID, **really** get sick many died it. mention many hospitals (at least beginning) would turn away people ""weren't sick enough"" went home died.

This biggest embarrassment. Lack basic income close second. works? positive, new cases started downtrending bit here's hoping sustains. Lmao hilarious. live vegas place atm. Plus bars ain‚Äôt fun it‚Äôs 5 people 3 bar stools apart. Nah, probably thinking Rudy, jerky guy Newark-- stays 21st Shaw Street, bodega Cook Liquor. He's always nefarious shit like described. dick 4th grade, too. Fuckin' Rudy... Pathetic children post scared death waiting vaccine isn‚Äôt coming time soon. 

The death rate 80 .26 

Less normal flu season. 


The media tools scared death, meanwhile 360 million people 

Most us feeding families. must luxury privilege gaming day. Well guess God effective governor preventing spread anyone know average age death? Can‚Äôt seem find reliable figure. Ditto. life already shit thanks several chronic illnesses, adding anything would break me. Dying would preferable. realize cases greyed otherwise highlighted symptom onset. know case numbers yet give time symptoms set people get tested choose so.

Literally day pandemic fewest numbers new cases today yesterday onset date -- look trends ago get accurate data. best, last week leveled week before, worst keep growing. Username checks out. Looks like upsyndrome. Pft. LA County? I've seen many live Phase 2 already going 100% capacity US 22nd tests per capita 7th among countries done 1 million+ tests. 

Every country South America done less 60% testing per capita US. Every country Africa (except Mauritius) done less 50% per capita testing US.

Personally think roll testing disaster current state testing much better. Even disagree think testing US still bad place, that's 1.6 billion people living countries testing much worse.

India another 1.4 billion people, done 6% per capita testing US. make 4.25% world‚Äôs population 25% deaths COVID-19. staggering, sad, infuriating. last time leader sacrificed millions sake economy Soviet Union Stalin. suggested calling them. I‚Äôve worried put ventilator ever get virus I‚Äôm quite skinny extended periods ventilator treatments kill weak people, significantly reduces person‚Äôs body fat muscle mass (I don‚Äôt much either ventilation could apparently dangerous me). Knowing risk, mitigate chance dying virus extended ventilator treatment right now? I‚Äôve careful possible, wish could stuff like going gym bolster body‚Äôs health, besides careful anything specific avoid dying get coronavirus? used look like ED drug website: funny think ""explain"" things people. Yes, reopening bars, restaurants, churches cause uptick cases.

But fuck people still trying say protests fine. cannot claim acknowledge severity coronavirus still maintaining protests notably worsen case/death count. partied bar went church choir practice, family reunion, surprise B Day party, or...
End day need testing, limit saw shit coming mile away stopped going gym end february. 

a week state reopening cancelled membership don‚Äôt plan getting another one least next year, even probably won‚Äôt till spring summer. tell New York, mom took antibody test got regular test well Sunday got results back next day. makes way easier since I'm sure people quarantine test positive. Except kills responsible people too. got sent check? masks 100%. regional mayors followed governor‚Äôs moves even anticipated them. shut within week. well-coordinated effort across state. Yeah. means me. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible MAGA supporter racist either actively support Florida man‚Äôs blatant racism ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care support based economy/etc‚Äù racist too. He's wrong means expert biomedical field, talked people field worked biomedical field vaccines (PhDs) basically said getting vaccine 2 years would extraordinary achievement. can't really speak countries, definitely think US one best infrastructures make happen used properly. entire thing farce, city even running. plan opening already settled day one. need campus North Virginia close military government stuff, need campus NYC thats center advertising industry. played game try get best deal could couldn‚Äôt get started moving without deal. need held hostage bastards take give nothing back. Iron lung  Also unfortunate earth flat. would definitely ones fell sides :/ people children also interesting Japan advised, forced, suspending business operations reduce weekly office work many sectors April, May business complied voluntarily

Also news media tended focus didnt comply complainers rather alternatives businesses adapt sluggish business don‚Äôt know answer question, guarantee chapter high school history book one day. wish. sounds exciting. cheapskates. say bitching Facebook making tiktoks. 5 percent death rate Thanks!   Local officials cheap That's true. think can't present solution problem say anything. confirm Corpus. Generally go 1x per week groceries. I've taken little head-counts we've stayed consistent half masked, half not, last 3 months. obvs I'd prefer % heading up, least we're slacking worse south. realize it, unfortunately higher priority containing this. also critical get aid GOP administration fight tooth nail avoid.  explains much right now. pandemic!? Wtf. masks. social enforcement masking strong here. it‚Äôs worth, real reason changing stuff reason call ‚Äúnovel‚Äù coronavirus. Novel means new they‚Äôre learning go along. 

It‚Äôs process mistakes. actually great estimate much higher: roughly .4% fatality 500k dead, it‚Äôs 125 million infected already, give take. Great! hope keeps up! Probably, I‚Äôm doctor(kind wish went med school) based I‚Äôm hearing lot clotting. Hardly noticed town (which 100 miles Houston). People mad bars closing wondering school look like couple months Thank God! Happily joking?

Uh no, going check week. 

Relax. people asymptomatic get lung damage. seem necessarily true 50% people getting lung damage. China great job controlling infection rate got going, hold China example. took really long time admit problem whole situation could avoided wet markets think. Plus China massive human rights problems. long term societal costs populations pursuing herd immunity going colossal. imagine political party deliberately caused long-term disability 6% population... roommate fled Florida cases started exploding NYC back March. going life usual, irresponsibly, eating restaurants, partying friends, roommate stayed inside past 3 months finally feeling comfortable interacting people again.

Today texted us COVID‚Äî decided coming back NYC Wednesday BOUGHT FLIGHT. can't make shit up. Help me? That's
...shit. idk say. That's fucked up? people legitimately cannot make decision. people live paycheck paycheck need work live. Yeah. Good luck million-person slum India pretty much definition poor sanitation, ability social distance, access PPE?

Idk, tell me, u/Butt_Expert. are. fix diet, like probiotics ""prebiotics"" happy little guys like eat. One day, kid not, likely able get poop transplant happier person. actually C. Difficil infections, future positive, many things living impossible tell what-all ones need ratio. definitely lot start. bet there's subreddit lol reopen crew moved lockdown goalposts ""the people little lockdown, treat"" though? Bruh

How see HUGE gulf ""killing someone"" ""treating someone respect""?

Just cop *kill* somebody mean ruin somebody's life. sounds like requirements medical professionals working close contact patients day long.

Not that's bad thing non medical professionals. seems like rest us going lives main point mask contain much infection wearer possible. Limiting spread people surfaces would need disenfected. 

Making steps still need take effective, less prone failure due human error.

Like shower curtain. may old, ratty, leaking little, using still keeps bathroom getting soaked.

And long continue follow rules, Stay 6ft others, clean disenfect surfaces regularly, wash sanitize hands, touch faces, limit exposure large gatherings, stay home possible. masks become first step containing germs, last step defending others germs. Damn guess covid doesn‚Äôt spread people protest huh? leaders..? Maybe desantis national guard compel people visiting public beach spend $20 means asymptomatic people continue walk around, spreading virus, simply know better. Countries test people symptoms end worse, countries test everybody.  Actually, merger US Airways... everything political. Science political unless tainted such, spun benefit one group. Protests OK police reform, OK shelter home. studies large groups unmasked people crowded together spread disease, spread disease, period. want ways political reasons. Man soul.

He‚Äôs looking favor 1% politically powerful crucial assisting reelection. he‚Äôs throwing hail marry trying boot 20 million people ACA buddies get massive tax breaks &amp; incentives. they‚Äôll support Donnie win 2020. Texas Florida getting press? Isn‚Äôt LA getting decimated right now? Florida ""Hold beer"" Much appreciated! Oh see. optimistic kill people. Wow right. read hundreds articles day news don‚Äôt recall single one rank-and-file soldier refusing ordered. back doctors? ‚Äúblinding chest lung pain‚Äù would thinking clot asthma.

Not medical, inhalers longer average redditor alive. antibodies don‚Äôt last long... god fear mongering sub annoying sometimes. suppressed Like people thought Utah had? oh true Pretty soon flying North Dakota something. dumb enough go area lots community spread bars open. Bits cheese fingernails, meat oils fingertips, spreading one order another... Yuck. hope true. 3 month old who‚Äôs going second round vaccines couple weeks people killed cops white, think dead whites enjoyed interaction cops? I‚Äôm asking, preaching Facebook wear masks really work? That‚Äôs last place I‚Äôd preach. amazing people still think taking temperatures going prevent spread. ‚ÄúI sure humans‚Äù 

What kind education teenage gone x1000. Can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs people applauding this. 60% state [lives paycheck sounds like accomplish sending sick people work. Glad son still you. Cannot imagine losing baby boy. Btw, friends growing deaf due early childhood meningitis. (I‚Äôm deaf myself, clue why.) horrifying disease. certainly not. studies come last two weeks showing thing. A-types likely hospitalized; O-types less likely. Countries don‚Äôt need import cases. It‚Äôs smarter let Americans travel. Right. also 150,000 people die everyday. number, I'm certain people would go insane empathize death and, I'd argue worse, suffering, everyone world. Yeah, cave manager large club rock, so...problem solved. We‚Äôre going Phase 2 Monday Washington DC, suspect wife won‚Äôt dining anytime soon. *Maybe* ever get phase 4, perhaps occasionally (outside dining only) phase 3.

But suspect we‚Äôll take-out next 6-9 months. Since 1776 -_- NYC reporting 800 deaths days April. Florida, almost triple population, reported 24 yesterday.

Goddammit it, people post worst worst here.

what don‚Äôt post side information.

there doctors said don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs covid don‚Äôt ever follow test ct scans cold flu patients. also said damage won‚Äôt permanent.

i‚Äôm covid denier, 99% sub fear mongering.

just keep part avoid it, reading everyday good. 

you might get covid, stress could give hypertension stress related illnesses. purposely suppressed coronavirus news depend much tourism. waited till last second close one first ones reopen.  virus control UK. 

Spain, Italy, Greece etc come regret allowing covid infected idiots country. late March.

I'm 100% cause I'm still struggling lower lung pain fatigue mostly gone. lose taste smell, different. Metallic everything. Even saliva. That's sign sinus infection general also significant covid issue. Respect opinion yeah disagree one. Heart disease also largely preventable stopped pumping foods full corn syrup grease selling 48 oz. sodas. Cancers likewise skin care like sunscreen smoking. Definitely fair say there‚Äôs unpreventable cases cancer heart disease think argument applies coronavirus prevent much, point someone going die unfortunately. Yea mean...required not, me, good nitrile gloves must. Never understood guys preferred wear gloves. Shit's nasty. others. You‚Äôre right. can‚Äôt keep people locked months years.

But far see preventive measures. New York Jersey got asses kicked badly apparently pretty effective test/trace system, rest states fuck all. looking data today, soon read \~10,000 infections recorded today FL thanks this. could read graphic data, highest # infected recorded around 8,000 day, must've read wrong. 

So, pretty much overtaking NYC's top recorded infection rate lock down. extrapolation, infection rate (and thus eventual death rate), higher Manhattan probably last longer go significantly shelter place order entire state. anyone extrapolating casualty rate this? rationalized it...

There's problem right there. rationalize *at all*. 

A rational person accepts scientists working good mankind (most are), there's vast scientific consensus something (such dinosaurs), consensus likely true.

However, one must always open finding new evidence either confirms disproves past theories, accept new findings shown accurate. Please take time familiarize rules sub, particularly rule 1. bit close wishing harm another user. Oh like North Korea then? feel like need place get thoughts real quick. know, one things really depresses compare response crisis response 9/11. next weeks that, weren‚Äôt black white, gay straight anything else. Americans, united help country heal. never time felt proud country response 9/11. 

The response disaster nothing short disgusting. people outright refusing even bare minimum help fellow citizens getting ill dying, complaining rights, etc. yet nearly hundred times people died due COVID 9/11. That‚Äôs staggering number. 

What changed? country become polarized, hateful, selfish? nature tragedy makes much harder people empathize unify? Well, I'll  Indian buddy said village taking seriously letting people homes food delivered directly door en masse. different regionally like US universal? really say that, unequivocally true. Younger people serious complications it‚Äôs even remotely comparable 60+ group Yup. trillions stimulus money could've UBI'd us good while. Rapid onset Dunning-Kruger due celebrity status. Happens lot folks. Musk, Rogan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terence Howard, etc. Sounds like want post cant handle elective surgeries banned again. main reason people wearing masks mixed messaging government sending. press conferences everyone wearing mask, something like people take seriously. Better yet, could local government pass emergency laws enforce mask wearing public, either. absolutely fault federal local governments. Yeah stupid. friend got tested smoked someone turned covid. symptoms still zero symptoms tested caution, came positive. needs emphasized majority American voters vote current POTUS. I‚Äôm too, doctor thinking upping dosage though, albuterlol inhaler, beta blocker well blood thinner( got clots active infection). It‚Äôs def challenge, even seeing go it, won‚Äôt stop fighting wearing masks, it‚Äôs ridiculous! makes mad sad see wouldn‚Äôt wish disease anyone! still don‚Äôt know long immunity lasts, don‚Äôt know effects us long term. noticed fort desoto today. (I spot launch within 15 feet anyone launch super early) whenever I'm driving traffic usually backed up. Someone said GPS said it'd 2 hours traffic go 4 miles weeks ago. pulled right away usually wait get road. also one hottest days remember even kayak lasted 2hr usually 4 7 depending time year.   weird conversation. went criticizing Abbott closing state saying mask work, saying he's taking iodine virus, ignored first two times mentioned vitamin D. mentioned knowing two people died grom said would ruin forth July plans. mentioned leaving restaurant many people inside. thought ""don't think bars would crazy packed fourth?"" like annoyed everything instead afraid. Thanks different vibe here. It‚Äôs really strange whole ‚ÄúHoustonStrong‚Äù mentality, zero sense coming together this. feels lot like riding Harvey - know there‚Äôs really bad shit happening outside people dying, yet you‚Äôre safely chillin‚Äô home, fixated news trying drink stress away.

I left complex first time today since Monday curbside grocery pickup. thought things might better - lots people wearing masks around complex elevator, drove past restaurants quite busy today. Apparently nightclubs still staying open saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù complete bullshit. 

I feel quite hopeless. Controlling can, sad frustrated angry see people disregarding other‚Äôs well being. Cases growing faster news report. A- STILL get dirty looks wear masks stores although seems majority starting catch on/abide. People drove attend protests. know several people drove Northern Cal Portland protests. Exactly beach problem distance? possible? parties bats restaurants? 

I understand another comment Miami Beach restaurants bars along beach. beaches like that?  It‚Äôs impossible wear mask sanitize hands touching people? It‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs literally job. also still working. work ICU people sick others won‚Äôt take precautions. course go work, maybe don‚Äôt go Tj maxx everyday?

Take look [provisional death counts provide data caveat takes several weeks count deaths, look week ending 4/18/20 example since long ago enough data fairly accurate.

There 74,839 deaths 138% expected deaths, based average number deaths week 2017-19. means 20.6k ""extra"" deaths 16,350 Covid-19 deaths. That's gap 4,250 deaths.

If right deaths counted due COVID necessarily I'd expect opposite effect, COVID-19 deaths excess deaths. Preach it. I‚Äôm dumb shit I‚Äôve home three months straight. Oh boo fucking hoo sounds like saying untested unreported deaths skew numbers much reliable even massive sample size. right? comparison different locking properly makes things.

The main reason interesting track effects increasing testing. double tests positive rate drops half, cases remain actually need increase testing, already catching cases.

It‚Äôs straw man argument. It‚Äôs literally discussion about. really heard CFR-denominator problem yet? Everyone talking since Feb...

The ""cases"" numbers almost certainly lower real number people dealt virus. asymptomatic cases never tested, lighter-symptom people never tested, people wanted tests get, false negatives / bad swab technique, real ""risk ratio"" ought much bigger number denominator.... i.e., lower final result.

(Also deaths truly Covid19 possibly well, especially global stats / countries like Brazil could lot uncounted deaths, believe less undercount... Deathly ill people likely get tested lightly-symptomatic people.)

Now, depending ask, ""case undercount"" could 2x, 10x, 100x. CFR ratio comes 5% death actual tested-case numbers, correspond real fatality ratios 2.5%, 0.5%, 0.05%. call IFR (incidence fatality rate), number takes account probable real cases tested/proven cases.

Note: lot incidence numbers come corners political bias (those want re-open economies want portray fatality rate low / less dangerous, want claim cases wayyy undercounted).

So measure many people actually infection swab-test count probably undercount? ""antibody studies"" come in.

Here's one real death-rate test seems believable me: [In early May, NYC seems 20% antibody rate (number people Covid That's 1.7 million population. time, NYC 18,574 deaths. So... real death rate (the Incidence Fatality Rate) would roughly 18k / 1.7m... roughly 1%...

In Iceland disease necessarily less deadly rest Europe, one countries tested massively. [""the country aggressively testing virus‚Äîon per-capita basis, highest rate denominator actually real sampling population, undercount represented ill... That's got 0.5% CFR... IFR CFR probably diverge much all.

There [other anti-body show similar sub-1% fatality.

TL;DR... cannot use Case Fatality Rates (deaths cases) derived main data trackers covid cases, estimate many people would die everyone got it. use denominator studies actually try determine real incidence Sars-Cov-2 population... results far point around half percent one percent. **Affiliation:** University Cincinnati, Operations, Business Analytics, Information Systems

""Event-study analyses provide strong evidence net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent hypothesis non-protesters‚Äô behavior substantially affected urban protests."" Yup. Also, U.S. msm NOTHING get across. continue focus restaurants beaches, one outdoors low risk, ignoring offices places business way likely inhale viral particles.

In fact, U.S. scientists much concerned ""right' surface contamination proof airborne spread accompanied perfect studies 40 signed petition paper removed PNAS showing well masks work airborne spread. splitting hairs helping. merely adds confusion warns making ""unproven claims"". 

Meanwhile, South Korea made plenty inferences based common sense study alone, MONTHS click through, ""perfect study prove causation"" 97 cases almost entirely confined one side 11th floor call center Seoul highrise. spite 1,000 people using mixed use commercial residential building's common areas like lobby elevator right alongside infected 11th floor, three 97 work 11th floor. 79 infected sat section sharing common areas center employees side floor.

heh heh... Dumb fucker. Alt right piece shit. Thailand would call universal healthcare America. would pay practically zero government hospital bills. 

Based experience taking care financially aunt serious leukemia like illness. need blood transfusions every months went ICU two times. course year, pay like $200 max.

There Thai private hospitals would charge Thai fortune hospital bills definitely cheap option. Like, got mono couple years ago I'm still ""back normal"" knocked good four months. I'm surprised news all! Straight dictionary-

What human nature? throwing terms without defining them. cant find video watched somebody explain experiment, ppl dont care truth, want ‚Äúfacts‚Äù support opinion, bring something saying hey right covid fake, wud like told so, bring something source says fake, watch defiant saying info incorrect something, feel like ppl lost causes would ""total number deaths"" sole relevant factor, disease brings high rates nasty long-term effects, like diabetes, lung devastation, chronic fatigue, renal failure others? 

It's virus *really* want get even die it. going add massive burden long-term systemic healthcare needs. Yes. like covid. Suing help. Striking will. Cool story bro. actually a-hole then. Thanks pointing out! It‚Äôs still virus. different races humans. We‚Äôre still human.

There 5+ different species coronavirus cause common cold. That‚Äôs part common cold vaccine challenging. lyin ass That's sexist term. Better watch they'll take woke card  agree this.

Democracy good, everything else bad.

We good, therefore atrocities commit good.

Those people bad, therefore whatever evil. Dexamethasone probably saved life. pain much better since starting, finally sleep normally again. Steroids brought worst cognitive effects, too. 

I'll probably bed watching cartoons weeks though. shit would take vaccine made 4 months takes YEARS make vaccines? airborne hiv. mentioned month ago. got voted. That's one highlights paper. imposition curfew cities fewer people wanting go protest, strong ""stay home"" attitudes among residents. words, cities protests, people likely stay indoors helped mitigate possible resurgence cases. let's give people idiots. mean, really go way actively discourage someone trying make sure best info COVID gets out?

A utility porter Caesars Entertainment died testing positive COVID-19, family says contracted work.

Don‚Äôt forget tons heart attacks strokes happening secondary covid due damage heart high risk blood clots.

Your point invalid detracts conversation. Yes. course live college town, favorite bar fills capacity big game nights. It‚Äôs literally standing room only, shoulder shoulder, like front row concert. 
I know aren‚Äôt *over* capacity, championship game nights fire department hits every downtown bar head count. 

Normally busy ‚Äúnah it‚Äôs crowded I‚Äôll come back later‚Äù Friday night less half that. 

Bar capacity way way restaurants, it‚Äôs fire safety only. How‚Äôs everyone holding there? happened last 30 years U.S. universities, U.S. financial firms, U.S. government. Already  joke.

I already explained. Try reading slowly  Yep. universal healthcare. conversation things. nope it‚Äôs wearing face mask. literal bare minimum can‚Äôt it. dad moron. Read completely fucked kidneys, taking breaths still hurts I‚Äôm still 93% o2 sat.

I still havent gone bar restaurant. Im playing safe know sure surges, dining outdoors open month,so im pretty certain led spimk. Fortunately, governor taking seriously people around well. Amazing accomplished competent governor ( whos made mistakes) aware population. cities take notes! Maybe small percentage, survive call martyrs. equally effective..... one look think DeSantis isn‚Äôt blame Yeah average age death 80. Oh no, communities manage survive this?        
Oh... actually dangerous preventable diseases present cause much horrific numerous tragic deaths society long live? Oh fuck those, lol, barely get upvotes posting these! No, article describes. many times need say it??? masks lower amount virus particles floating freely air coming blowholes. community protection measure. protect others learn virus could spreading it.

If worried catching Covid virus particles getting eyes, wear fucking swim goggles too!!! Masks bare minimum. Yeah get that's want get tested twice like 90 days apart? telling test blood comes twice ensure HIV? 

Count that's case - want blood red cross tested properly. way could deceptive illegal aliens excluded count. trace resident back say NY count there.....it is. odd many vehemently denying runaway virus virology lab Wuhan published research developing SARS/HIV chimaeric virus. Fuck off. No. reporting cycle think 11-11 get another update tomorrow.

But tomorrow huge update. mention it‚Äôs weekend weekend reporting low side since beginning. I‚Äôd guess next days even worse terms new cases. nice actually seen proof surge would know real picture even worse. know still probably bad, bad could been. We'll reliable data kids go back school American here, super disappointing here, especially since I'm one top three states covid numbers (Florida) 
I work restaurant following rules keeping capacity completely booked reservations last night even one walk-in lucky get sit 30 minutes next reservation. 
I like job working, sad see people care go regardless. also offer Uber eats doordash delivery people coming make sad. 
And there's bar next door serves minimal food stay open ONE gets food there, every night see people drinks walking around masks food. 
I go work go home now. they're thinking critically. get intelligence critical thinking mixed up. told story children, told story true someone respected taken face value entire life. Even accept now. Sweden's decision making based virus little information severe was. feel comfortable living Sweden. another pandemic kills 5% population? Knowing country going try would scary me. 

Even country trying failing would least make feel better government's approach citizen's wellbeing essentially throwing towel fight begun. Exactly. Sweden acting like countries come lockdown doomed resurgence, hasn‚Äôt what‚Äôs observed part. Countries resurgences (actual ones, dozen cases day China Australia getting managing) usually ones opened back still ongoing widespread community transmission like US Iran did. exception I‚Äôm aware Israel, daily case counts single digits reached 621 cases yesterday. 

Besides public health experts become increasingly optimistic possibility getting safe, effective vaccine distributed early 2021 maybe even late 2020. battle may long Sweden thinks. might be, also might half over. don‚Äôt need purist stay safe. huge difference going bar picnic park. also even good news... many people wearing masks Virus surging like is...that would terrible. symptoms allergic rhinitis, symptoms seasonal cold flu, essentially identical

I watch symptoms like hawk, plus flu knocks colds make mucousy. chronic, year-around allergies get postnasal drip nasal congestion, plus heavy sneezing itching there's ton pollen air. Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre asymptomatic...? Maybe traditional ‚Äúoutward‚Äù symptoms. that‚Äôs still symptom. Irrelevant fact way guaranteeing vaccine one strain would effective strain.

My point.  That's stupid response. saying ""Either take huge risk getting covid, get paid"". kind stupid mindset caseload never really dropped US, currently spiking Serious question: Swiss nightclub look like? picture head movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, even though France, 80s. That‚Äôs image Swiss nightclub. Lots mirrors, white pants. Big hair. could wrong... believed survive gain level immunity, get harder harder wipe out. think work, see countless studies conducted. However, working 8 hours day people room, even wearing mask help you.

This guess least. yes, and? large death spikes would unclear global data. fact, robust data would suggest wouldn‚Äôt anywhere near early pandemic Lmao course fucking did. Tyvm info. appreciate it. Hopefully still case, statement days old now.

I feel beds surge capacity. hospitals make capacity give people beds, might capacity care monitor beds equally. 

The quality care go quite bit get surge capacity. huge problem NYC keep monitoring every patient people coded necessarily see major signs.

Luckily lot changed learned treat patients. think see situation prepared. reference, NY moment 940 people hospital Netherlands 1% positivity rate. comparison. Hmm sorry , outside US think guys rich, fat dumb. least that's stereotype know. generalisation wrong. Still doubt general consensus Americans thought smart intelligent I'm surprised ""never do"" 7%. lot people proud never wear mask *ever* owns libs whatever. yesterdays numbers Florida. report day behind believe. uncle used like that. Unfortunately didn‚Äôt get help died. young understand Phase 1 ‚Äúdo kill worse virus‚Äù. Phase 3 trials evaluate efficacy. Collect coins. Need much know. I'm Florida.

We actually report day behind.

You're going see today's actual numbers tomorrow said wait. There's lot day left. Begs question manufactured wuhan like chimeric virus properties SARS HIV.. Ummm.... first time?! realise COVID killing people Italy ~160 years! Sorry mate, lost... view hospitalization county dashboard(s).

Also monitor beds ICU capacity top control view hospital beds vs ICU vs county vs per hospital, etc. False negatives HIV test occur. Thats danger.

False negatives also common early infection, hence waiting period.

vote blue think he's saying science might fall victim politics. Outside factors like listed (rush protect economy, bias poor, anti-Chinese sentiment, etc.) could used hijack scientific method push agenda. Look masks, science certain moldy potato brought life radioactive suntan lotion basically called question using clout push new, inaccurate scientific narrative. Science politics good pair. seeing everywhere... statistically hiding start new spike declining tail another one somewhere else. might accurate US responding whole, aren't, response regional, hiding spike across south merging statistics Northeast brought outbreak control, misinforms.

I'm starting lose faith I'm optimistic person. large faction people refuse wear masks, number go personal crusade make others wear masks. Mostly premise Gov trying control us, tyranny, overblown, whatever else peddled.

In eyes perfectly clear mask use common sense fully adopted, US continue struggle....badly. person simple, painless small job do. Wear fookin mask stop slobbering breathing people. That's it. That's needs done. divisive line sand mask use continues battleground sides digging deeper instead working towards important goal. sickening. want normal life back dammit hate wearing mask. every single day moral civil duty part solution problem. 

This pandemic engraved history devastating costly event modern times US made exponentially worse people refused care refused wear $1 mask part solution. God help us all. either part problem part solution. absolutely nothing help start looking mirror things getting rapidly worse getting much better. 502,537 dead people disagree too. keep reminding #NotAllSwedes fortunate one reasons concerned lovely Swedish friends quite critical Sweden's strategy (one making serious plans leave Denmark even). *man* harassment abuse I've gotten Swedish Troll Herd greatly darkened opinion least sector Swedish society, probably good. 

As someone used debate climate denialists online, attack twisty rhetorical patterns eerily similar. equally un-endearing. removed comment, wow ashamed. said people reporting context factually hide that. part problem. went isle palms weekend mom talked going rest family. beach disaster county park. Shoulder shoulder people, stayed condo. felt irresponsible go one seems care. need stop going non-essential high risk places immediately. walk park fine, drink bar not.

I could agree more. 19th 20th roommate went out. even drink, social person looking girlfriend. started symptoms Monday 22nd went home early work day. know allergies maybe something else. gets worse, sick. Wednesday night decided going self quarantine, likely COVID-19. called boss Thursday morning happening house. Thursday get tested clinic. told us three five business days get results. access clinic rapid test. tested second clinic, results positive COVID-19. let boss know positive. get call back employer's HR person telling ""Stay home reevaluate next week.""

I home since Wednesday night stayed mostly room. symptoms feel like matter time get it. taking temperature 7:00 7:00 PM. reading higher 98.1 F. sucks. Sure argument based conspiracy theory zero actual science simpler say people stupid..well, are. Leadership exist US. 

Our nation led someone demands believe hoax wearing mask defiance / traitorous toward him.

Truly, deplorable. Yes, President United States claims thing virus. Thus attitude germ theory denial.  bailout money get help too. Yes correlates people don‚Äôt care helping society. way prove people can‚Äôt care society. I'm glad job. Unfortunately lot teachers bare minimum collect paycheck kids learned absolutely nothing. kind self reporting worst kind data collection. course everyone going say wear mask don‚Äôt want ‚Äúthat guy girl‚Äù part problem. kind results ask people recall food intake near accurate told truth they‚Äôd answer overweight issues place want ask speak manager. I‚Äôm Miami tell vast majority people wearing masks indoors, wrongly noses peeking out. Ok know that's measured, MN trending poorly. 

After 7 days averaging 350, MN's last 2 days 493 417. 

Let's wait bit sound alarm. think lesson world learn us sit ass nothing lockdown, won‚Äôt work.

But bust ass lockdown everything get key infrastructure running, work. Reddit phds told deaths trending downwards, happened? got joke made serious reply back. big city

It twice entire population city live second that! Remote learning brought set challenges. Like you, put many hours regular classroom (if more!) Yet problem wearing pants lol right fundamental misunderstanding major difference protesting systematic killing certain races occurred country going bars restaurants bored staying home. Cuz guess what? Protesters going bars restaurants reopen now. that's important right now. get takeout hang friends zoom. protests made point - captured attention nation forced arrests officers case changes police departments. everyone going bars restaurants country besides spreading coronavirus putting low income servers risk contracting virus? I'm American adult counted? Maybe news theres 120k deaths pandemic thing thats impacting us right now. 

Why need punish everyone kill others instead wearing mask selfish, ignorant Idgaf attitude main reasons. common trope, many people know actually *know* flu?

I've known one person last year. Zero people 10 years that.

Either people know lucky vaccines, engage high risk behaviors likely get infected, bad cases flu rare. Could elaborate? ... people know this? it, like 50% recovered individuals neurological problems, permanent scarring lungs injuries well? Masks meant prevent wearer spreading it, meant prevent wearer contracting it. everyone wears masks public places, fewer people get virus people positive know yet mask preventing spreading it. It‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs big deal, save lives. part. potential customer, fucking mind go sit room bunch people wearing masks 
 
You described GOP base. Exactly. teachers selfish. they're scared work quit. Imagine doctors, nurses, cops firefighters said work safe. 3% might cases worth trouble. Together methods. like ""3% reduction useless."" Depending situation, might be.

not really. one viralparticle enter given person. ie billions viral particles would-be new infectees.

it matter much inhale (say) 9700 10000 viral particles - still get sick.

the sad fact viruses - need clearing virtually order dent transmission. virus - viral load *may* play part acute severity - want get even asymptomatically still quite possible long term effects lie dormant years eg brainstem eg like herpes zoster (smallpox). sars2 already shown invade brain, colon, kidneys etc. ACE2 receptor hijacks gain cell entry found nowhere body testes. means next decade could bring fertility crisis - men! 

short answer UV/ roof filters never, ever close sufficient comes meaningfully combatting viruses community wrote thing first post. repeated times lol.

Europe take incredibly hard extreme measures.

It‚Äôs like entity trying effectively spread coronavirus- could write piece good conscience? People die. 

And what‚Äôs deal title? protest marginal tax rate it‚Äôs gonna get infected blm fine? 

We scientifically realistic want keep people safe politically active. People post stories like want cases surge protests youth behind much it, think movement time take much pressure lose steam. Fewer people show people start realizing coronavirus apolitical infect possible humans regardless social cause. 

We don‚Äôt want this, presumably, make safer protest habits ‚Äî stop obvious lie keeps popping exclusively recklessly, shortsightedly, leftist sites- demonizing actual progressives discipline time. needs mandatory antibody testing children across country schools open up. fair POTUS prevent dying Covid. think okay go out? stay houses forever vaccine maybe doesn‚Äôt come get spread out? 

The truth coronavirus exists now. It‚Äôs going disappear suddenly disappear stop spreading like flu disease. feeling countries staying locked forever going even worse second wave. article gave heartattack.

Then read paper saw critically ill patients, closer Post Viral Syndrome HIV.

The actual journal didnt even mention HIV.

Wow. article incredibly misleading, title comments.

What yalls smoking. want some. History shows governments history violating human rights. Like slavery. what's point? DeSanchez said would backfire. I'll wait hopefully I'll get kt.. trust vaccines trust bill gates. kind want make sure specific vaccine safe take it. Dude y‚Äôall need lockdown Yes Houston multiple days protests. wonder year, ever, America accomplish great feat. Well done, Italians! 1 many, kicking ass! wear one last year? POTUS refuses wear one VP can‚Äôt even utter word mask. Also people wrongly believe purpose mask. Thanks clearing me, little twisted. not, second wave underway start seeing daily infections rise. Unless evidence contrary, outrage lifting lockdown wholly unjustified. numbers add up. Working population America 155 million. claiming 50 million baseline number significant bump long lines saying minimum 1 3 lost jobs possibly every person America high end. think numbers bunk. Oxford English institution frontliner vaccine race. directly government institution like CDC 

And even weakened strain virus, designer strand RNA, see causing many complications, October timeline seems plausible. Wrong-o. lied to. evidence even seriously credible argumentation masks work protect wearer. obviously fallacious proposition face it, given health care workers already infected. complete, full-throated, bald-faced lie put masks work. patently obvious prevarication.

We argue motives justifications day long--that's politics for, try avoid that--but there's question kind ""masks protect public"" intentional, deadly, lie*.* 

When contemplating facility people power lie reason whatsoever, obtain full complicity press so, one must never forget weapons mass destruction found Iraq. agree pretty much everything here. don‚Äôt understand everyone thinks US ‚Äúthird world nation‚Äù though. couple aspects, it‚Äôs pretty insane comparison. Well, sorry hit way. many people make claims India without going there. thought one them. is. really, really is. \*shudder\* businesses caused many stay home curfew times Yeah definitely ‚Äúchillaxing‚Äù teacher! you‚Äôve walked week someone else‚Äôs shoes, don‚Äôt speak it. Digital learning challenge within itself. definitely put many, hours, regular classroom setting. Yes unfortunately unions makes public schools country shit. testing it. Otherwise could give vaccines since already created ones smaller tests work. reason it‚Äôs going least another six months proper testing. 

It‚Äôs scientists call politicians. Lame get it? guarantee number mutations increase and/or increase greater rate? Yes no. Serious question obviously well-informed respondents itr:

If kids can‚Äôt go school parents must go work, how? ADA needs put statement send fliers businesses post store doors supported fined $5000.

And stores need follow through. store take name ID everyone using stupid cards report them. even make something normal work. Asian countries wearing face-masks (especially feel sick) default. Nobody bats eye wear one there.

When wear mask western countries (Europe, America) get weird looks would get labeled bit crazy (in non pandemic times). Everyone uncomfortable joking around masks made mandatory, simply option wear one people got used it.

I promise you, said ""masks help"" enforce rules maybe one twenty would wear one shopping. that's optimistic. sister died vent FL last week. fucking pissed home state. Like screaming pillow mad. MANY PEOPLE FUCKING STUPID SELFISH? fuck's sake, wear mask maybe postpone bar crawl haircut little longer FUCKING KILL PEOPLE COMMUNITY? forgotten thing, too... getting fired insurance rates went employer expensive insure. 

We need single payer. Man, thought summer would temporary reprieve pandemic, feels worse point spring IMO, least U.S. least spring, people taking least somewhat seriously, still nice enough outside go walks sit deck.

Now, 50% people longer taking seriously varying degrees ignorance, we're unacceptably high plateau new cases, region country setting really hot humid summer nice days. Sitting front AC weeks end, nowhere go pretty awful.

At least fall looking lot hopeful decent shot ending pandemic vaccine new treatments. worry matter time hopes get dashed too. people definitely reject forever.  Hopefully enough people dont, reach immunity maybe eradicate it. second wave 1918 pandemic much deadly first. first wave resembled typical flu epidemics; risk sick elderly, younger, healthier people recovered easily. October 1918 month highest fatality rate whole pandemic.[41]. 

This timeline 1918 flu. first wave normal. second wave referring cytokine storm happened. know joke, bit lame.. lol collective bargaining 100 alex? union support = open schools. Considering that, statistically, US worse ever been, States things inside open re-opening? 

Seems like much country hard Italy style lockdown. understanding thinking remaining open maskless people delaying (with significant human cost) goal life normal. need effective everybody, needs effective enough bring transmission probability end infection chains reach many people. biggest advantage vaccine herd immunity.  That‚Äôs literally refusing work unless demands means cool.. laughing Darwin think isn‚Äôt well known yet. would involve protesting fighting rights pandemic that's dangerous! Much easier blame fellow citizens like true American! sounds like favor flooding country antibody tests prove 70%+ population immunity? (let's assume actually get long-lasting immunity) correct, could go ahead open country. correct, guess hospitals Arizona Texas full right implementing overflow plans... Ah, okay. part India live in? experience living metropolitan rural area? anecdotes share? curious. We're well truly screwed Sunday numbers. Usually Sunday Monday significantly lower days. Crazy. Im pretty sure theyre already used wearings masks time Japan. Oh please would actually expected. science showing mask use alone large effect stopping virus. article science based reason wear mask? Politics matter comes pandemic contrary popular belief here. lots mirrors white pants? Well, course *does* impinge freedom sense would entirely free whatever want, can't see benefit everyone, including themselves, deserve (ok, my) contempt. I'm UK, counterpart masks situation US could Brexit. continually heard people saying good reasons voting Brexit every person ever saw giving opinion able present flimsiest horseshit. rational objectors wearing masks (or supporting Brexit) seem extremely thin ground. first sentence (and title!) article goes want Severe cases COVID-19 cause lasting damage lungs may necessitate surgery even organ transplants. stupid idea. happening. Hospitals already preparing AZ. Cases still rising. 

People wear masks stay home much possible. themselves, healthcare workers, going busy coming weeks... Exactly. Raw case numbers tell part story. people desperate claim Florida worse NY peak. nonsense. Glad European days. Although handled perfectly everywhere overall response OK since initial shockwave. Even good single nation examples. Whenever go out, idiot bias people taking coronavirus seriously staying inside. possible 80% people see outside wearing masks time 80% country wearing masks whenever go outside.

The US attack small minority anti maskers idiots much worse damage country looters rioters did. anti maskers beaten jailed. Fuck off. They're happy teach online. Yeah I‚Äôm Columbiana County area Ohio, hardly anyone following guidelines here. Thank like places, actually got hit people know real

Regardless point stands studies indicated much higher death rate CDC says dopamine hits upvotes get encourages people fearmonger hopes getting gilded.

What pathetic, sad life people must have. Using partial statistics like reach objective conclusions always lead factual results. different anti-masks proponents arguing certain states like New York New Jersey skyrocketed cases masks became mandated, therefore masks harmful. 

But experts agree masks help agree gathering large crowds harmful. Thank positive contribution. Take care. low counts contact trace contain outbreaks without destroy people's livelihood. That's winning society isn‚Äôt educating public wear masks job CDC/government instead lying effectiveness?

Also, people wear masks shown also better social distancing don‚Äôt agree ‚Äòfalse sense security‚Äô, entitlement ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô seems like much bigger issue Americans good, right? seem testing much here, rather calling flu. background studies like last ones went pretty standard, nice. would hate deadly virus inconvenience glasses. means indulge yourself. American, blame either Great news! let‚Äôs grow hair good cause teachers/faculty one thing. Another aspect people don‚Äôt seem concerned kids passing virus school, kids go home family. give parent, sibling, grandparent, etc. gets hit real hard it? still virus going crazy. Maybe US try social distancing instead hiding behind shitty math say death rate lower 1% Please feel free message time need someone talk to. understand lonely be. Much love. Unfortunately that's correct term them, look south Korean, Taiwan, Vietnam south east asia..masks contact tracing. 

Never closed, yet ""patriots"" want masks everything open. Florida, Texas rest south showing happens simple things needed.

Viruses care rights. Especially given much already know virus amiright asked it. I‚Äôm compassionate creature natural selection work. People stupid don‚Äôt live long lives.

Tell peeps prominent positions, likely opposite, might prove good thing. Link posted? Show civil? post right post claimed civil, get lying now? Shameful. really awesome. Wish could pinned everyone visiting thread. 7% population Karen's US. whatever male equivalent is.

I notice improvement went grocery shopping Friday given state finally mandated masks public enclosed spaces. sure enough leaving one middle aged woman looking moderately affluent wanders without mask. agree you. I'm antivaxxer means, fully vaccinated advocate regularly. 

It normally takes years develop test vaccines, ensure they're effective also without unintended dangerous side effects outweigh good. US tries push new vaccine short term optics feel rigorously vetted, I'm sitting data points exist. I‚Äôm doubting u 9% terribly high. That‚Äôs worrying. That‚Äôs EXTREMELY rare US. People area coastal NC bragging Facebook, posting pictures themselves, SC. beaches bars closed, SC‚Äôs open. would drive day. Even say NC strict, would spend money SC. going months.

I'm glad literally understand hospitals work. phrase ""Houston problem"" taken new meaning. 0.21% New Yorkers died coronavirus. sure getting 0.3% from.

And regardless results, Reddit said need peer reviewed study draw conclusions. Yet don‚Äôt need peer reviewed study claim? I‚Äôm confused, need peer reviewed studies not? overthinking downvoted anyone different opinion? thought known already? Like taxes immune system makes people susceptible illnesses, people also get pneumonia lot live Italy, believe numbers trustworthy.  Also, vast majority people respecting lockdown (which strict), everyone wearing masks everywhere.  logical number going down, little possibility virus spread last weeks/months. one time peer review. I‚Äôm 31 got really sick recurring issues 20-21 ish. issues never linked EBV I‚Äôm unsure it‚Äôs something past reactivated time not. definitely look Facebook group, it‚Äôd nice know I‚Äôm alone possibly find outside support.

It‚Äôs virus, it‚Äôs month. it, they‚Äôre fine! I‚Äôm sure probably heard too. It‚Äôs disheartening. wish luck, thank letting know fb group. Months? Doesn‚Äôt seem justice legit. That‚Äôs amount time human pregnancy... would almost year earlier documented cases etc For-profit blood banks that. Red Cross too. proven assertion. counter argument, present common cold.

Not hood comparison whatsoever, covid deadly, common cold not. sars-cov-2 single virus spike protein mutations. Common cold multiple types completely different viruses. There‚Äôs never huge funding regular cold vaccinations, it‚Äôs complex issue little benefit, opposite sars-cov-2. hey don‚Äôt take word it, listen familiar name: virus induces immune response, overwhelming majority people recover. fact body capable spontaneously clearing virus tells that, least conceptual standpoint, stimulate body vaccine induce similar response. although guarantee, think clearly likely not.

Yes. will. like experts say: mutations likely major impact. Possible. Unlikely. SARS much easier get control? killed quickly, leading less people getting infected.

There‚Äôs still SARS outbreaks today. virus doesn‚Äôt spread well 1.

Subs like tend draw people love cater extremes karma. Yes, coronavirus bad change world fucking zombie apocalypse people like make comments like ""OMG like airborne AIDS!"" such.

It's what's bad social media general. dopamine hits upvotes get encourages people fearmonger hopes getting gilded. work food service like pulling teeth get people much speak hear behind plexiglass partition. None come wearing masks anymore. They'll bring way allowed sit together refuse broken smaller groups. placed signs tables far enough apart social distancing people ripping ""Don't sit here"" signs. 45 year old children throwing tantrum. given way virus develops human body, ""total deaths"" metric runs month behind stats.

 Three things. Deaths track confirmed infections start US pandemic enough tests time idea widespread virus truly Northeast.

Deaths probably tracking infections correctly many southern states accused fiddling stats reporting many probable Covid19 deaths plain pneumonia. Also, although epidemic getting worse many states still nowhere near levels reached NYS.

Lastly, understanding treatment Covid likely improved good deal past months, mortality dropped somewhat.  Thanks nothing mr Useless. Thanks this. True this. Orlando yesterday people waited six hours get tested. ain't symptomatic ain't waiting long 90 degree weather. want know too! I'm curious lot US ppl seems those.

Even parks open limited capacity, making nearly enough cover costs. panic mode guys, life yes life dangerous, deal it.

Naturally, I'm alarmist promotes proactive, rather reactive approach. Ain't perfect. let respond agreeing points....yes life worth living....yes get dangerous....but no.....

-there's difference rational vs. irrational/smart vs. ignorant approaches
-there's difference dealing dangerous situation either making worse, nothing all, playing small part collective effort help out

If tell folks deal it....they deal smarter way. ignorant way. They'll lose ignorance really quick loved one lost Covid, reality hits. *""Out sight, mind""*....not acceptable.

Yeah, let's hope vacation season cause significant new outbreaks (the country open internal travel foreign tourism selected European countries - depending current infection rate). Luckily, places tourism heavy, created special testing stations, free citizens foreigners alike. Bigger cities already easy access tests everyone without symptoms (booking online). This, along extensive contact tracing, hopefully keep numbers low. Fingers crossed. 

For unaware: masks never required (outside selected workplaces health care), Denmark among first (European) countries go lockdown still confirmed cases. Lockdown pretty extensive allowed time testing accumulate PPE etc. effective mitigating spread.

I liked much company reacted crisis General. Homeoffice since mid march...

There ways safely. impossible. definition works perfectly well.

Your definition easily counter-exampled numerous countries. also counter-exampled statement citizens allowed certain See even faced objective facts refuse admit wrong.

You explaining think argument correct, stating think argument argument based notion rights granted taken away government. aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôve explained multiple time.

You explain *why* case rights granted government still exist. have, again, simply stated think still exist.

If rights granted, they? floating around sky? rights concrete object grab to?

I've pointed appears rights exist Britain. stated do. certainly appears though don't.

I'm asking, think rights apparently present still Come know anything philosophy know question can‚Äôt answered Reddit comment.

I'm asking define terms. think that's reasonable request. idea reasonable question controversial.

Anyone downvoted really take break Reddit becoming problem barrier discourse. Well government took foot brake ago Never said ppl give antibiotics virus, literally said post cv infections understand bacterial infections take place given lung state post cv infections. wearing mask loved ones. random person. right thing still selfish reasons. mutually exclusive Red Cross notoriously bad charity runs high admin costs. one them. people didn‚Äôt believe it. told wife. said said beginning March. 

COVID uses AIDS attack tactics. It‚Äôs airborne like FLU. sticks like GONORRHEA. interesting things like HERPES. Hits like PNEUMONIA. damage organs like major disease.

I warned lot people look now. Whatever disease is, f****** serious. need take precautions best possible. nasty feeling 5-10 years, we‚Äôll COVID man made. basically keys contain virus: stable message, early fast testing, social distancing, mass population wear masks, contact tracing. 

This article said USA failed all! Step 1 understand what‚Äôs going United States would separate northeast south.

So yeah definitely used whataboutism, 

Maybe I‚Äôll stop using logical fallacies do? can't get cancer sitting next someone cancer. 120k+ deaths lockdowns, masks, social distancing, etc. would much much higher Thanks NYC pretty good mask wearing social distancing. 

We‚Äôve shit. Definitely case checking user name would helped üòâ Yep, think Florida Florida‚Äôd recovery. Looking total deaths worthless measuring current size outbreak.

Every news story I‚Äôve seen use Facebook photo illustration. many people protesting, lot engaged general stupidity. Partying, hanging friends, going around without masks. Many businesses also reopened without proper protection employees. Meh, depends quality thread count .cloth Meanwhile USA... depends. live north east Florida plenty secluded beaches nearby literally parking lot beach, maybe one outside shower things rinse sand.

How long think medical scientists conduct studies? pandemic US approximately 5 months dude, I'm sure know future. 

For now, there's PLENTY evidence shows cases long-term complications covid. Yes, know this. Mississippi removed Praxis requirements alternate route. summer state colleges producing thousands alternate route teachers.

The question ""why mass testing like everyone else"". answer simply ""mass testing impossible nobody else either"". Lol ok thanks. bet people ""don't believe COVID"" also believe god. comment huge dinner make sense America knows virus opening up?

Suing probably help too. well lot seem get even simplest paper masks, would probably think much less use n95s, great deal protecting others droplets. many anti-mask people think n95 wearing useless that's selfish thinking. basically even that's crappy masks wearing, long people wear would still work, different way. Also, seeing hospitals spiking surging headlines states 25 days death rate stayed 1k 18 days. I'm simply questioning type patients hospitals. would think would seen spike now. know like 3 4 sparklers back yard pail water put in- parents said don‚Äôt touch hot put pail go out. dumb brain said nah I‚Äôm gonna grab them! burnt crap little hand. Thankfully I‚Äôm 4 anymore understand danger without personally affect believing it‚Äôs real. live Eastern new Mexico maybe see 2-5 people store wearing mask even though made mandatory. I've work Texas town hours away maybe little less half people wearing masks state opened stuff back up. I'm usually person wearing mask. I‚Äôm Texas teacher one big city districts TX barely get funded basic school supplies, way get enough funding PPE. Yup. New York locked weeks reached 10k new cases per day. FL deep outbreak could muster closing bars? God help people, leaders spineless. way spreads time ever around. single case spread many fast new clusters pop races again. new clusters everything 2nd shut contact tracing can't work easily spread virus. 
Example China shuts Bejing. 

This going hard one. People like crowds going happy. Umm courage? 

China operates whole different level USA. Yeah, welding people‚Äôs doors shut don‚Äôt go good containing virus, shit wouldn‚Äôt fly USA you‚Äôre pro science concerned safety period rushed. Pro science means pro data driven results decision making. vaccine process drastically accelerated potentially undermine process making sure it‚Äôs safe. super pro vaccines, come family doctors scientists, patent attorney works directly scientists. problem don‚Äôt trust Established long-existing vaccines production methods, it‚Äôs several documented cases new, rushed, sloppy productions totally bad outcomes - Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome 1976, live polio polio vaccine (Cutter Incident) even contamination rushed pharmaceutical production across many med types. concerns doesn‚Äôt mean WONT take vaccine, won‚Äôt clamoring get front line find rushed GMP check something. 

Extra wrinkle: woman childbearing age looking family soon (but old enough dont want wait decade), there‚Äôs literally way scientists checked whether safe pregnant women, somehow impacts fertility gamete fetus health, etc. making vaccine faster make babies, way ability tests.  Sorry, misunderstood original context. number 85 now.

[Harper's remains closed COVID cases climb least mention people infect along way! past number months think Stand. fairly liberal buddy mine recently told cooperate contact tracers want government tracking him. 

The government trying get people, rather help people problem society. Even perception, people afraid government. people need better, might call United States, that's accurate anymore. America 6 weeks react full knowledge bad was. America actively decided deliberately make bad possible. China blamed maybe first 10-20 thousand deaths US. Everything fault. seeing irrefutable evidence warmer temperatures effect whatsoever virus, anything makes worse since people indoors avoid heat. Myrtle Beach still open? 80% = all, most, some. many actually ""all""? 10% 80%? bet someone wore mask one single time months ago would indicate part ""all, most, some"" group.

If 80% actually wore masks cared, country COVID hell-hole moment. asigntomatic? government said masks dont work. wear time, must work? it? relatively young person who‚Äôs mom passed away lengthy battle chronic conditions, I‚Äôm grateful day got spend her. I‚Äôm sure kids feel way :) Yes, basic science. Explained well, five years understand it. also right track first, TJ clusters fucked up.  rule makes ineligible? stay home go bar know disease likely spread.

I agree whole #StayHome message extremely disingenuous term ""reopening."" many people acted like whole world stopped bars restaurants shut down, pathetic. Hang on, massive protests cause increase part? owners bar everything could customers morons. believe would nearly enough, would big improvement status quo. course, ""Last month wore mask went Costco"" loophole technically ""some time"", worn one

I think Florida NYC levels, given population density, doubt ever be. said, think fair shun one flawed stat pointing another. Well, problem they‚Äôre thinking months, antibodies gone, along immunity. saw comments remote education coronavirus. educator fellow Mississippian, many districts don‚Äôt funding ensure remote learning quality every student equal opportunity access means remote learning. district, simply cannot provide laptops every student don‚Äôt funds, therefore option send home packets. effective?

Ok, fair... that's small trend forming... could random (hope so) Agreed. 

It attempted even youngest kids although I‚Äôm sure would impossible still clearly enough 80s image latch onto perhaps. know lot people live Switzerland absolute dorks, wouldn‚Äôt surprised dark sub-culture around sex dominance humiliations!

I hoping article would define worst case scenario not. followed hyperlinked text not, also. thought donnie said, ""If die, die."" think US government making vaccine though. top vaccine right Oxford, England. interesting see graphs every continent nextto other. never realized Europe place far serious initial outbreak contained overal Americ\*cough cough cough\* people still think fake believe catch it. gov Florida‚Äôs well. benjamins.

Ok, Karen Yep AEw testing constant basis world champion sitting home, *might* caught wife. 

They're better least. seeing country adhering ""safety guidelines"" quickly becomes futile effort bars.

Bars need closed time being. horrible idea open. Good Michiganders brightest. Lol, course history. Face masks Asian countries gained popularity early 20th century pandemic influenza wiped around 20-40 million people (India lost 5% population back then).

A years later Great Kanto Earthquake 1923 put lot smoke air masks came again.

And 1934 second large flu pandemic cemented use masks.

It trial fire, ""their culture much responsible that's wearing masks"". takes large enough event right forcing people use masks. soon get used idea new pandemic rolls around see put one (even longer mandatory).

It's getting rid stigma, make normal thing. nobody cares wear mask people automatically get responsible. Coughing/sneezing lot? Put mask! True Yes, group stable across 4 weeks. sure mean food delivery comment, isn‚Äôt gonna food delivered. But, can‚Äôt control people outside camp time white people shit restaurant place people put things mouth mask thing prevents happening. I'm entirely unsurprised people wearing mask restaurant takeaway risk scale one ten, restaurants six virus exposure. allowed open region attained containment effective contact tracing precisely impossible masks effectively used mitigation strategy restaurant situation. People comply, repetitively touch them, compromise function. Human rights keep people dying.

The US well enough wasnt kidding said become fashionable walk around suits look like spaceX spacesuit full face helmet good air filter back. 

This never goes away unless transmission becomes impossible. honestly mixed response. Many say good. Others say bad. never get consensus US. I, personally, know enough opinion...just hear news read online...I live 1000 miles (1600km) away area country. ""I wear one stores mandatory mask policy anywhere else."" Please look US (CA, AZ, NV, TX, NC, SC, FL), Israel, Portugal, Czechia. true many irresponsible citizens. real failure one leadership. starts top, many offenders would change tune overnight orange buffoon changed his. could predicted elect unqualified, mentally-ill reality television star lead, get hot garbage leadership? live Vancouver I‚Äôd say maybe 50% people wear masks. people wear inside stores buildings transit- hardly anyone wears outside. really don‚Äôt need you‚Äôre walking around, go inside somewhere it‚Äôs best wear one. that's 7% death rate. Good know. absurd. think China shouldn‚Äôt shut down? problem waited much long, didn‚Äôt shut down.

I live NYC even lockdown hospitals overwhelmed grim 2 months. lockdown. 

You‚Äôre also mistaken people would keep living normal without lockdown. doubt many people New York would going eat drink taking mass transit sending kids school midst outbreak- lockdown not. unconstitutional whack moles. run grocery store safe ways. absolutely cannot run school safely without many compromises there's point even trying. misread headline briefly considered one two punch involved defunding virus. Maybe stop paying virus it‚Äôll go away! wild elected president promised travel ban brown people reason make white people uncomfortable.

And pussies midwest we'll end subject (legitimate) travel bans ourselves. Oh definitely. saying judging CDC decisions made way less science NEW virus entirely fair. think time made call based knew then, transfer touched masks surfaces likely risky vector, too. 

It lying telling truth based know time.

And masks risky: even people can't actually wear masks correctly. see every day, many times day. Noses out, touching front cloth .ask touching door handle...

But know right, ""freedom entitlement"" definitely screwing Americans. That, lack Federal coordination consistency (idiocy entitlement?). I'm glad live state shit together. Still can't get PPE would like feel safer going back teaching August. Still worry testing shortage returning cases region spike. 

America's response virus competent response would expected life. Thank God state elected someone sane, echoes brain week national catchphrase: ""united stand, divided fall."" understand? zero reason wear mask, beliefs apply virus. monster. He'd almost paid phone off. People afraid online learning work many kids solution worst behaved kids disturb everyone.

During pandemic, elementary kids go back maximum 12. vaccine trial already showing positive results. fast tracking much data clinical trials done, would distributing today. probably see general distribution year. China done 91 millions tests pay extra great education, lol. teach monkey sign, would baby gravy worth much! üòÇ keeping staff cost high turnover, horrible PR come employees dying could make money short term logic, Africans aren‚Äôt race Africa many different countries people from? Asians aren‚Äôt race either? Racist double standards. lockdown quarantine necessary evils. tools fight.

If vaccine like decapitation strike enemy HQ, quarantine/lockdown like evacuating protecting production facilities populations. Vietnamese strict lockdown procedures here, even agonizing period quasi lockdown. Noxone complains it... well, complain much.

Yet, report rise suicidal tendencies. Hell, morale even better. idea submission removed because

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* I‚Äôm city bus driver Florida. Yesterday counted 70 people transfer center. 45 actual center, 30 people group vacant lot next door. 4 people wearing masks. communities drive see minimal mask wearing, lot groups 10-20 more. 

My company authorized us start passengers wear masks bus (no mask, ride) June 15th. It‚Äôs getting better, it‚Äôs struggle. American I'm done wearing pants. OK clearly headline fuckered here, I‚Äôm still pretty confused. mean practical standpoint? I‚Äôm hearing it‚Äôs good HIV drugs may work. I‚Äôm also hearing common many illness, fact nothing like HIV. regions open cross borders movement other. Like EU opening Sweden penalty box. Maybe Canada NE USA could join EU block Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, Japan etc

Russia, southern US, Sweden Brazil YOLO block. takes one person going bar weekend fuck rest you. Yup. traffic Conway cranking week fourth coming. work stop people emitting particles. nearly effective filtering incoming ones. Virus particles also go eyeballs. reopens? Europe reopend weeks ago already... swear God nothing makes livid people that, aside maybe people noses hanging out.

How stupid be?? paleontology assistant Covid? dont care US. ars allowed enter EU long dont country control.

Im still sorry people.

The POTUS idiot, US gov incompetent.

But doesnt change fact chinese gov tried hide tje virus first place. Probably told government Arguing close friend thinks become another seasonal flu cause coronaviruses related flu ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Poor kids get fucked, course, horrible, world-changing plagues often hit poorer harder. That's argument following sound public health policies. Troll. *wasnt encouraged go protest That's viruses work, like all. Thanks Bring third year med students baby! Problem solved. agree. shocking people throw like matter older people die. 

When pressed that, claim care say something like, ""then take precautions"" though monolithic old people live island somewhere isolated everyone else. 

It's discouraging people can't make incredibly small effort would take end thing. article 14 years ago. ARC policies changed. sell blood. charge hospitals storage safe transport. going laugh you. second thought tend agree. think warp-speed vaccine rush US politically motivated. Especially vaccine comes week election day. Vietnam Also week ago last checked, already 15,000 deaths supposedly Alzheimer's/dementia, beyond we'd expect given months past 5 years. one comes goes camp duringbthe 4 weeks one can't get it. 
But one bad food delivery worker over. Dont bother telling facts. It‚Äôs nice teachers union something like this, front line workers? I‚Äôm sure grocery store clerks would rather exclusively pick delivery. doctors would rather telephone appointments.

So, feel sympathy teachers, working public facing position part job. It‚Äôs hard support still expecting many thousands others go back normal duties. Yep checked stuff too. follows trash subreddits too. laughing scared?  one person talked interacted laughed. feel scared reaction. say strict quarantine, don‚Äôt mean stay home. things I‚Äôm sure rest world would agree with. Forcibly removing family members, massive surveillance aspects life, temperature checks everywhere. Removed facility positive. It‚Äôs effective also well beyond governments could get away with. Must nice leadership takes regardless election cycle. He‚Äôs calling stupid actually admitted known fabrication total example politics undermining science- said manipulate human behavior disocurage mask hoarding. isn‚Äôt science. That‚Äôs politics preventing dissemination science Yes, painful coughs experienced 58 years. Literally felt like razor blades coughing weeks. Constant urge cough, like hair something refused dislodge.

 Here's hoping immunity now... loved ones get it. seriously concerned ask doctor rather reddit, imo 30 seconds enough pose serious risk circumstances. already difficult spread virus outside, let alone short time, also add likelihood children virus particular time, also low. Everything say true, change fact there's deadly pandemic going around, worth teacher's life make kid arithmetic sub-optimal circumstances 9 months. low counts good surveillance + isolation spend time lockdown you‚Äôre preventing infections spreading via quarantining individuals. Gee police near might money deploy sniffer dogs bus station impoverished area. loss society be. truly get busted pretty drugs. February thought federal government going nothing everyone cower homes 18 months. 
Now know federal government going nothing evens cowers homes 18 months, least states going try. 

I agree prediction quite easy then. definitely completely makeable. It‚Äôs disappointing position ‚Äúif don‚Äôt understand position, people stupid.‚Äù

I stand original response - don‚Äôt understand someone‚Äôs view seek understand better. seems correct, really relevant comparison?

The interesting counterfactual would ‚Äúwhat would different Trump told everyone wear masks?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat CDC told people wear masks Feb?‚Äù 

Telling people something, demanding do, leader says ‚Äúdo want, I‚Äôm going to‚Äù, recipe getting people rowing boat direction. fantastic movie. rewatched months ago. American race matter say. risk children spreading virus appears low, makes feel better. mean, living immunocompromised person leaving house all, probably wear mask always get tested periodically. scenario, might ease mind get tested. don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre going see revolts parties involved clusters cases districts open followed another closure.

This pandemic burning hotter ever US. states well can‚Äôt let guards states COVID inferno exporting cases. We‚Äôre already careening towards another lockdown many states - people don‚Äôt get yet. 

There‚Äôs way resume person learning kind traditional fashion circumstances. solutions unpopular, doesn‚Äôt make solutions. College fall probably bring incredible explosion covid. one bar Michigan 85 cases. Imagine school going Michigan State throw 50 bars frat parties dorm parties. going real shitshow. Chinese people's mind: Chinese supermarket town used open Christmas, Thanksgiving, even CNY half days, closed three month. think different mindset. Whenever used say everyone would downvote me. ""Only medical professionals need n95 masks"". Well there's reason need n95s - lot effective. Safety measures apply medical workers applies everyday people too.

By way there's also p100 respirators even better n95. I‚Äôm going argue. guy reading publications, emails frontlines, interviewing doctors researchers, etc every day 5 months. wrong apologizes posts links sources, hear saying actually go read ‚Äúproof‚Äù. Yes. heard number deaths gone total number infected cases gone younger people (20 30 year olds) getting virus spreading it. schools kind money. fact states cutting education balance budgets does, spreads easily air-conditioned buildings. care Karen Doug. care owner restaurant losing livelihood investment. Raises hand I‚Äôm fan short, yet point title is. could effect U.S. decades. 

Like WWII devistated Europe Asia, left U.S. relatively unscathed.

What happens world sees Europe safe, avoids U.S. like plague manage get act together. Hope enjoy becoming vegetarian then. may like it, kinds places way millions people fed reliably. waste reduced? Absolutely. try make cleaner humane animals? Hell yes. Judy getting rid places would ensure millions die. Florida even test much one day? I'm gonna point countries 1% population. people, harder unify them. 

We compared China Russia, that's pretty much it. 

Comparing us Denmark Finland bullshit. saying well all, people forgetting big America is. us West Coast there. Weekend numbers, too. There‚Äôs good chance spread virus among dozens people river. They're already 10,000+ today SupPOsEd eaT MaSK On?!???1!?1??! (is word?)

Yes, that's right word. 


If longer word, like ""destitute"", English speakers would say ""more destitute"" rather ""destituter"". Okay, tested some. ever approved clinical use humans? nitpick sake public safety:

I agree said. summer outside distances, safe. mask needed. 

Winter might different situation. fuck traveling area? 

Jesus fuck people retarded. American agree decision. American I‚Äôm sad. Get place Fox viewers opportunities make lot money get sick. 

Fox worried sued study. Fox's attitude shows know culpable. hope lose! Whoever making rules Michigan prioritizing money lives.

Politicians badgered restaurant owners guess? even good economic perspective. It'll blow even worse. mainly think families + people relationships allowed meet (with quarantine requirement). Exactly. Bunch people see baseless post Facebook decide live lives it. Thanks that. whole world wondering you, American, thinking. there's lot shouldn't. actually European country fine, yank wanting come see family/friends stay. account? Mine? Nope. typical guy thoughts. Yes Amateurs talk strategy generals talk logistics Got link study bub? They're liars üíÄ doubt it. I'm hardline atheist realist advanced degree humanity-based science. 

I respect science scientific method, that's evidence shows, that's evidence shows. litterly suffering got it?! Damm dude hope feel better soon Rochester, NY.

We locked 4 days earlier NYC back March. We've first region enter phase, far we've continued curb stomp virus. 

Indoor dining started two weeks ago, may see spike. Even do- think we'd manage it, possibly revert back outdoor dining. Best case- we're able stay phase four foreseeable future. Fingers crossed! Great ""news"" everyone, fox. Look did! killing viewers. Italian style lockdown USA would kill people virus.  would crash USA's world's economy. literally worse virus  Thanks Captain obvious ""only 7%"" good news here? That's fucked Probably yea Yes, USA coordinated response COVID federal local level. Can't solve everything money. isn‚Äôt purely political. know I‚Äôm arguing bot, comes Fox News politics science inextricably mixed. design. think people need start resigning idea Trump going face repercussions leaves office. Americans rehabilitate George W Bush, Trump 100% rehabilitated well It‚Äôs difficult position business owner. Shut two weeks open week again. another reason indoor dining **during explosive growth we‚Äôve yet seen Florida** doesn‚Äôt make whole lotta sense. 

Because mismanagement epidemic restaurant industry Florida utterly destroyed along thousands thousands livelihoods. say Trump office time vaccine available, remembered he'd still tell people vaccines kill anyway. Yesterday working told man shopping young daughter, seemingly mother, ‚ÄúSir, need cover nose mouth.‚Äù said something busy ignored kept cutting cheese (cheese monger Whole Foods). looked briefly see nose said, ‚Äúmouth nose!‚Äù like, ‚Äúthe law states need cover mouth only. nose‚Äù eyes rolled away got back head, called store manager right front came down. time got family moved on. manager spoke, boss came said guy said medical condition. Wow condition manifested quickly. didn‚Äôt mention me. luckily mother daughter masks saw them. 

If you‚Äôre one people, why? guys realize we‚Äôve working shit months. don‚Äôt want fight you. want health considered. wear mask EVERY DAY day (even breaks we‚Äôre eating). 20 minutes shop AC? Suck adjust like have. heard instacart grocery delivery services?! 1) ""Safety guidelines"" oftentimes conflicting confusing depending whether referring guidelines bar, city, county, state, CDC, etc. 

2) Clearly, evidenced photo, guidelines also mean nothing they're set, customers following them. could've well place, unenforced unenforceable, outbreak would potentially obvious outcome. guys think lockdown good idea? I‚Äôm uneducated I‚Äôd like somebody could explain perspective flawed. perspective would impossible prevent spread Corona due people deciding rights infringed upon, unless people forcibly locked houses. Also, would Corona go away people weren‚Äôt contracting while? seems like unless vaccine developed lockdown doomed end massive spike cases Masks essential help stop huge outbreaks happening now. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs crucial
at moment. really don‚Äôt get people pack bars restaurants still pandemic going on.

It's also infuriating local authorities allowing indoor dining places. ""we need reopen economy"" something üôÑ fuck paywall.

TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) ‚Äî five hours shoveling rocks family‚Äôs backyard, Jimmy Flores, 30, met close friends bars Old Town Scottsdale Saturday night June.

‚ÄúThis bar super packed. kind concerned like, man, everyone‚Äôs tight, limited cups. people sharing drinks, weird,‚Äù said Flores, also shared drinks friends night.

The next day, Flores said body sore going bed, shrugged tired working drinking. Then, Flores woke middle night temperature 103 degrees.

‚ÄúI texted buddy said, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm getting flu.‚Ä≤ goes, ‚ÄòThat scary too,‚Äò‚Äù Flores told Arizona Republic.

After testing positive COVID-19 week June 8, Flores said Maricopa County Department Public Health employees able trace new coronavirus bar north Scottsdale. Flores said department asked share name bar.

He admitted June 15 Banner Baywood Medical Center COVID-19 pneumonia experiencing body aches, nasal congestion, fatigue, headaches, chills, sweating, shortness breath, symptoms, according Flores.

Flores one thousands confirmed new COVID-19 cases month since Gov. Doug Ducey lifted stay-at-home order Arizona. Face masks became mandatory across Maricopa County within last week help slow spread virus.

Once hospital, doctors used oxygen tank assist Flores‚Äô breathing gave mixture antibiotics corticosteroid treatment.

Flores also learn coughing technique lay stomach help breathing.

No visitors allowed hospital admitted went days without able eat full meal get full night‚Äôs rest, Flores said.

His friend, 41, also tested positive COVID-19, hospitalized, Flores said.

Since contracting virus, Flores started posting updates journey Facebook page raise awareness. initial post shared 2,000 times.

‚ÄúWhen initial post went viral, got lot people kind like, ‚ÄòDid boost post? pushing narrative?‚Äô ‚Äù Flores said.

‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt meant political. supposed ... saying, ‚ÄôHey, didn‚Äôt take seriously. like you. didn‚Äôt think gonna get COVID. didn‚Äôt believe COVID didn‚Äôt know anyone got it. ... got worst possible way.‚Äù

Flores said visited public places pandemic secluded bar contracted virus from, ‚Äúbut biggest thing sharing drinks ... hate anyways, never done that,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt wearing mask, still giving people hugs.‚Äù

After week hospital, Flores discharged home Monday, breathing still challenge taking multiple medications, said recent Facebook post.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely going very, very, very, protective-gear kind guy sure,‚Äù Flores said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going extremely careful, think I‚Äôm kind making mission educate people tell story.‚Äù

His friends family also created GoFundMe page help cover medical costs. Flores said insurance help costs, receive hospital bill another week. ‚ÄúI really care people going take seriously really hurts,‚Äù Flores said. fuck taken at? Cause sure shit anywhere near true am. Ebola 90% mortality rate

Covid 19 5%.

Just factor magnitude biggie. think worst case scenario is
- Hundreds thousands dead, 30000 month vaccine widely available (400,000-750,000)
- Millions long term respiratory issues trillions future health care obligations survivors
- 18 months 25 percent unemployment
- potential financial crisis due trillions recent debt generated economic value, potential collapse dollar money/a place stay would fly back EU tomorrow. (Am dual national.)

I'd rather risk trip stay US things seem increasingly going bad worse. I'm super vaxer, I'm going take initially. Regular vaccines hands safest, easiest, cheapest thing protect health, way meticulously researched, developed, tested process years, months. way hell I'm injecting anything developed Donnie's Operation Warp Speed. I'm going continue stay ass home, wear mask, wash hands I've worn fingers away, take regular flu vaccine August. say Trump office time vaccine available, remembered he'd still tell people vaccines kill anyway. People truly don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about. Businesses required provide reasonable accommodations (such allowing customer use face shield looser mask/scarf instead), required accommodation could threaten health safety others (such wearing mask). Ah, okay. Understood. Thanks. better definition, please point me. **This HATE ACCOUNT ... either bot someone influenced controlled bot.** agree. think people far removed average teenager younger capable of. still kids. responsible. Classes stand front lecture thing anymore. 

Anything online going take 20% longer 50% less effective.

Keep mind push hard distance learning. opinion one reasons lockdown slowing economy time learn severity virus (such potential long term effects, mortality rate) finding adequate ways treat it. I‚Äôm indefinite shutdown, makes sense completely overwhelm medical system even know we‚Äôre we‚Äôre dealing with. It‚Äôs poorly understood novel virus we‚Äôre facing lots unknowns potential risks we‚Äôre careful. Reading stuff like reminds read *The Rise Fall Roman Empire* got part ignorant Christian took basically reveled ignorance, superstition, anti-multiculturalism, cheering great works pagans crumbled around them. Fuck America doomed. read infection rates shooting I'd venture say employees malls gyms can't afford nanny. mind blown nonchalant attitude many community. Something wrong us wearing masks slow spread looked like problem don‚Äôt get started shameful ‚Äúleadership‚Äù Scottsdale. embarrassed. Wut? 

Keep hyperbole arguments spreading false information. Keep moving goalposts, it‚Äôs great mental health. Keep taking selfish attitude towards everything. Keep thinking FAIR. Keep thinking cultured everyone else feeding superiority complex People don‚Äôt ware masks don‚Äôt answer polls. could find another article reporting study im sure source information comes backed science Deaths per million yesterday: US 1.58, Italy 0.135 Could asked guests wear masks since opening? Sure, see wouldn‚Äôt want turn anyone away resorts strip not.

Get section rope simple DIY arm-over-arm, find empty parking lot push/pull car, load wheelbarrow move that, even logs simple DIY. 

Powerlifters weightlifters luck without gym specific equipment. Strongmen fine anything long it‚Äôs heavy. Indoors least. politicians want restaurants open it'll ""reopen economy"" something üôÑ assume vaccine come United States? Here's news article Sunday: control improving :) Corona hoax. disagree. But, people will. live idea land. tons people avoid tested afterwards, avoid getting fired kids dying street. human nature protect oneself family. perhaps childrens starving death goal? perhaps working sick reigniting Pandemic goal? Jetblue requires people wear masks. Middle seats blocked. overbooking flights. Thank Jetblue. Damn right I‚Äôm going selfish. It‚Äôs health health medically fragile special education students. teachers get paid worth risk. Ideally also find system teachers less risk volunteer go back in-person teaching teachers reason worry teach kids decide go back type thing. It'll tough balance strike impossible. Itll require everyone act selflessly hard achieve would ideal. claiming there's 99% survival rate. 

Fucking idiots. Even that's right, want 1% people know die. That's way funerals I'd like go year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entitled, whatever need essential.‚Äù really is. Reddit developed poor reputation tolerating promoting climate change denial, evolution denial, germ denial. hear they're changing soon though, cracking bit.  instant? lied then, know atent lying now? America Trump viewed third world nation. meant MAGA? wish people would start thinking outside box things like this. international embarrassment. Good job Italy! I‚Äôm American quite honestly, don‚Äôt think Covid issue due government anymore. Covid issue US citizens people making poor decisions. data science available anyone read understand. People making political issue since election year. 

In reality, economic issue. White collar positions work home. Blue collar positions work place. 

What idiots don‚Äôt realize, wise up, kids sitting home day online learning impossible go work. people saying send kids back school fall without masks. 

Its shit show many different opinions matter government says does, people going upset. 

Just FYI, beginning. I‚Äôve said sub I‚Äôll say again. Closures failed businesses future states. already rioting looting major cities. matter wins November, going ugly. 

What people realize, large group law abiding citizens storing ammo, guns supplies. American people, ‚Äúsilent ones‚Äù straighten shit out. ‚Äúsilent ones ‚Äú consist white, black, brown citizens. blame them. American. 4th July weekend entered chat room. IQ thing, I'm pretty sure people slums know details viruses. however listen authorities need to. Yeah, numerous things like testing, tracing, rent, unemployment, etc.

It 5 months, hearing masks? understand needed? pulling trump calling easy things garner easy support ignoring deeper issues? 100% shopping. never I'm exercising I'm social distanced everyone. big thank selfish assholes couldn‚Äôt wear mask stay put miserable homes allowing see family Poland. 

I‚Äôm tired first attitude country. We‚Äôre also winter Australia.. we‚Äôre seeing anywhere near 20x cases warmer months... Yes ... maybe correct definition credible baseless. make political hay anti-vaxx, it. ""I trust Chinese vaccine neither patriots let's buy American #freedom"" legal state passed point giving fuck. almost 50k cases 5 days? No, test blood, testing 100% perfect, want avoid desperate people high risks (e.g. intravenous drug users) lie order sell blood. US daily cases still rising, Italy's daily cases dropping lot. take long US overtake them. Deaths follow later. It'll another 2-4 weeks people start die. Thanks info! I‚Äôm sorry hear can‚Äôt go home yet, hopefully family staying safe able see soon way knowing many billionaires private disaster bunkers...or governments like Russia China. 

It takes one. Shit, thought vietnamese. /S think that‚Äôs haven‚Äôt received checks. Supposedly they‚Äôve prioritized poorer Americans.... may interested, here's American girl recorded experience Wuhan since January.  Lol Start preparing, unless there's vaccine there's hope hell. There's control many people actively care. Yeah, live central PA (could college town in), we're worried student return uni- what's going classrooms, happen outside affect us. seen swiss girlfriend four months looks like anytime soon :( People highly infectious 2-5 days start showing symptoms: period pre-symptomatic people appear asymptomatic perfectly capable getting others sick without even knowing it. 
If want refer data, least make sure present whole case rather cherry-picked tidbits suit narrative. Thanks reply, appreciate information asked everyone wore mask public, ""80% said yes"" , determined lie Covid care. Unless elderly taking careful measures younger people, result fewer deaths before. That‚Äôs hope anyway. Eh? expect rich families pay better grades. Really way explain W, Trump, others seriously braindead don‚Äôt *need* lift weights specifically ‚Äúoptimum level health‚Äù. Lifting weights building muscle health specifically. Sure, healthy initially, certain point quickly becomes muscle.  Breaking news!!!! Trump decided make new Europe Mexico pay Wait, thought *we* ones allowed travel bans?? There's always 'sickout'. Outbreaks Germany. Problems Croatia. Sooner later fire find dry tinder. spelled American way wrong. That's people sub want nothing stay home apocalypse indefinitely give uninteresting life purpose. negativity sickening. obviously sustainable thing. think taken moderate approach first thing. Leave things open change protocols practices safely

I agree, people crowding doctor's offices dentist's offices. Without contact tracing cases, could say people getting infected? Even so, enough evidence elective surgeries, dental offices, essentials available causing spikes cases. evidence that, lot places, schools causing outbreaks. many businesses, essential essential, facts side chose ignore them.

What's essential causes spikes? Indoor dining, indoor bars, enclosed spaces people encouraged crowd. places, unless run 25% capacity, reopened. im sure could enough force ‚ÄúLet kill patrons!‚Äù one Bar owner heard said.   see you‚Äôre saying US new cases daily Brazil summer They're really committed. shock, they're treating everyone like they've always treated low income people, disabled people, immigrants, POC. Business usual. shocked, I'm sorry. really difficult deal with, new, got even blatant it. Based what!? start believing China, country tried hiding virus, say?

How quickly everyone forgives forgets! don‚Äôt know big deal is, cases nearly 11% since yesterday, beaten CoVID19 again!

Probably I‚Äôm American. I‚Äôm angry, I‚Äôm depressed. angry. honestly think it‚Äôs simple. taking preventive measures ensure employees stay healthy. 

If business doesn‚Äôt income, eventually able continue paying wages. think they‚Äôre least trying make work. It‚Äôs like Adelson, private citizen inject money publicly traded company. business needs able cover expenses least. have-died-in-self-isolation-at-homes American don‚Äôt even passport Tbh OSHA doesn‚Äôt really exist protect workers safety, it‚Äôs protect companies liability. NIOSH organization actually scientific research supposed inform OSHA regulations. reality, OSHA doesn‚Äôt usually play nice NIOSH scientific findings. OSHA politicized department compared NIOSH. Cool. new Strawman combined Ad Hominem assumption political message.

These data inherently historical, essentially unreplicated experiment. asked something like ‚Äústatistical principle‚Äù driving conclusions I‚Äôm telling ‚Äústatistics‚Äù don‚Äôt apply instance want claim 2x difference telling lot underlying mechanism driving apparent difference. Whether two numbers like actually different complicated question. null hypothesis not. Given understand system, hesitant assume country better country B difference magnitude.

Please note, never used term ‚Äústatistically insignificant‚Äù, adding confusion here. whole point data perform statistical test draw strong conclusion from. mandate really going much us want wear are, going continue to. People rebel mandates, way US. Prepare make plans God-fucking-dammit, man. never said crucial, idea about.

I want know ignoring everying else dire importance.

Why sitting around talking masks much needs done? NE better mainly people wearing masks. LA huh? Still short way go 0 huge improvement i. Last three months. However, us, clue done last three months. transatlantic flight issue. family member actually returned Europe yesterday (legal papers sign) said total 46 people plane seats 220.

On US connecting flights every single seat full... turn phone sideways looking :-) cursory glance, closure member states EU external borders behalf EU MS seems possible. straight easy way would result major showdown.

However, issue hand sound complicated. coordinated EU level resulting recommendations coming there, controversial. Afaik, new legislation really required. least Schengen states could also decide multilateraly inbetween necessary. Looks like greed politics remove ICU data projections. Go play lego No, American dumb. Euro smart. Mirror submitted article: http://archive.is/WXq2o guess humorous response witty statement bound seen another knee jerk ‚ÄòMurica response. 

But enjoy extra U humor makes feel better people colonized Lockdowns useless aren‚Äôt using time ramp contact tracing, implementing detailed open plans, generally controlled way manage outbreaks. 

Some states didn‚Äôt. also found steroid greatly reduces death rate critical patients wasn‚Äôt total waste. 

I think lockdowns maybe useful couple states including mine actually detailed plans opening city. states? No. prolonged inevitable. 

Even mandating mask wearing enforcing could prevent much death. Lockdowns aren‚Äôt worth while. subjective course, fan humans (with exceptions). Seriously? takeaway rant? cares greatest jesus. figure speech. point america became friggen superpower economics military (if care stupid metrics dont measure happiness) school district took survey 57% 1/3rd.  giving parents choice person remote. Oh cool fine! Good luck collecting fine. Polio spread 138 countries 30 days.

Welcome Pandemic Houston here. It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôd say leave bill hicks I‚Äôve hospital days, COVID. Per protocol given test first arrived. get tested leave? Obviously everyone wearing PPE, I‚Äôm bit anxious I‚Äôve contact many people. reports happening recently (I mean patients without COVID infected healthcare workers).
Also, soon infected get positive result? I‚Äôm getting tested want get done right away. imagine isolate away family waiting results.. that‚Äôs going fun four year old already mess I‚Äôm home :( live Germany Italy opened borders weeks ago. Coronavirus numbers low countries. Travel resume responsible countries. Well, eventually we‚Äôre going figure something else out, then. Whether vaccine, treatments, whatever. really cannot see continued shutdowns years years viable solution. I'm surprised research even time make comment. I'm impressed. hospitalizations continued fall today ones keep deleting. know don‚Äôt actually get deleted right? guy idiot they‚Äôre following infection trajectory would expect country run idiots. See US details Really dude? Everything besides first paragraph
Is rails? know it‚Äôs way realize snidely dismissive virus MANY people truly that. fear fellow man, loneliness, lack positivity towards future poverty. 

Mental Illness substance abuse ALREADY epidemics. Ask anyone involved lockdowns lack social contact EXASPERATE problems.

I‚Äôm saying brother isn‚Äôt cut dry. Also hoping reasonable conversation thread deteriorate insults Coronavirus intuitively felt ICU saturation, normal Beijing Wuhan, mother Beijing finished IUC surgery testing nucleic acids.

What believe matter. Keep saying bro, could months beginning nightmare ends  make sense. virus make brain dead beginning Trump's precidency, wanted build wall keep everyone out. end presidency, world wants keep out. Oh no, even close. feverish feeling pretty unwell month, exhaustion brain fog. like Americant even alive, stop taking credit. Right, we're right back question, much immunity long It‚Äôs required live deaths US low today compared number cases (so far)? Yes, quickly heading situation enough medical supplies beds. bought time learning disease, designating surge sites stockpiling gear. That's terrifying.

Next week we're nurses critical care experience take heavy patient loads ICU. There's choice. fully expect quit. Source? UK let anyone in.

Next time I'll drive car Calais, take train UK I'll take 10 refugees camps, pretty sure get it. yeah, concept ""freedom"" today morphed pure selfishness. ""you freedom, long freedom definition freedom"" local walmart, screen employees ‚Äúrequire masks‚Äù. 90% wear masks nose, I‚Äôve seen several move chin want talk. Even grocery pickup, attendant hooked ears chin bringing groceries out. think never people go public much, much people concerned/compliant enough wear mask. lockdowns intended flatten curve. method proven work however half assed it. yes virus would go away people quarentined. Two three weeks really serious quarentine would significantly reduced virus' ability transmit replicate. live imperfect world virus able find hosts lockdowns ended seems like everyone forgot pandemic, hence current upswing curve. Right disturbing trajectory.

This person, unfortunately, familiar rantings current occupant 1600 Pennsylvania. No, Melania. hate virus, hate country/people take seriously. 

Had Texans remained cautious mindful, brought second spike, couple mightve spared.

This important impress upon others ""safe/not risk/not worried""(such myself!) virus still careful mindful - you, *everyone*. China doors wide ass open! Come bring endangered species soup you! bioengineer DNA turn Man-Bats üòÖ Per million us less deaths UK France Italy Spain, state Europe done much better false. Europe fast pass? shame, one richest societies history world. right, many parents terrible choices ahead.  make legal businesses ban people Retirement homes, hospitals, restaurants vaccine (once becomes readily available course). Masks required even effective hiking. would never let facts get way impotent rage, would you? know sort trails hiking, cannot imagine wearing face mask hiking local trails summer weather. Good God. Hahaha... great comment.

Must hit nerve there, eh? That's I'm thinking well. virus, countered way China's, becomes like sort guerrilla virus, makes sense. can't get rid completely, pop again, different places.

I guess nations strict (such China) hoping vaccine without major side-effects market long now. that's fair, hope way turns right one, eradicate virus completely vaccine impossible. could less done remote island nation New Zealand, majority country possible that. bridge still available too? There's much shit streets Paris even anymore ntm China Russia much attractive locations. fact interstate travel allowed makes way dangerous opinion. sucks New Yorkers who, tell, followed guidelines well see good idea us Europeans. still dealing crisis possibility different wave. That's uneducated two cents. Maybe trump getting Mexico pay wall along. Got Mexico. They‚Äôre allowing Americans travel there. It‚Äôs self-quarantine. It‚Äôs imposed quarantine.  welcome beliefs Sadly head big fedora would like fez me. Orange power!! What's reasoning? Make sure showing class time? It‚Äôs right decision, honestly matter right now?

People shouldn‚Äôt traveling. it?

Covid us likely years come enough population go heard immunity activated starts around 70%.

Scientists knew beginning heard much flattening curve objective get hospitals ready keep numbers making critical situation.

Yet people still doomsday mode.

It interesting people eager shit USA, silent sweden plans closing anything would impact country much, primary schools restaurants... stating recommendations.

It interesting plan paying higher number deaths per capita USA... 

but lets pretend need fill water. Oh well, big boy now. shouldn‚Äôt argue history degree America failing, ladies gentlemen. Hawaii low death count, imagine yuppies flying vacation dooming island live shithole country. Y‚Äôall might want build walls. ""After officer placed Administrative Leave, investigated found wrong doing. officer feared life, forced shoot suspect 32 times. wss heroically reloading pistol, suspect, could described aggressively gasping air, startled officer even forced unload second magazine. thanm service. #ThinBlueLine"" leaders country, using science medical professionals drive actions, instead whatever *gestures wildly america*.

They signed lead failed this. definitely problem politicians.

Americans also blame, politicians too. Based today‚Äôs shopping trip 3 different stores, call bullshit. 

And mask wearing 100% mandatory compliance. you‚Äôre one very, can‚Äôt wear mask need curbside pickup, delivery, online purchase, friend/family member shop you. 

We could squashed thing Americans right thing...after exhaust possibilities everyday. getting vitamin D. love outdoors anyway. frankly good time me. almost airplanes sky smogging blue. build wall nothing corona, don‚Äôt want Americans anymore. /joke, sorry Bet doesnt go Anderson Cooper again. maybe learn difference refugee immigrant. Covid actually stays away people knows they're together protest. That's literally zero cases associated protests, never be. Shh america bashing allowed sir.  We're smarter this! ones never clearly live TX, AZ, CA, FL. Americans enter UK? Average teacher salary state almost $80k/year. jobs pay much less 12 months work. Like fact that‚Äôs death rate low extremely low young people. 

That statistics. 

More 130 K Americans died 3 many EU countries also worse US.

This wrong idea talking about.

Some countries got hit beginning time prepare. good considering cirsumstances.

Sweden crap like Containing means nothing lock people forever.

If knew anything, wold aware lockdowns eased months ago.

It's funny 3 months lockdowns liften success, still know that. 90 days managed misunderstand fully see well goes.

Yeah go smack head wall, maybe works great! Yep Also testing delays. Many states still using tests take 2 7 days return instead widely available rapid tests. NYC still using slow one. states counting presumptive diagnoses not. data sucks around. mean fact we're argue climbing hospitalizations cases shows US learned nothing NY. Well, that's unfortunate cannot demand people risk lives kid can't learn online. know whole bunch scientists involved (at Ox &amp; Moderna), know ethical enough lodge protests things rushed.

Whether get media access another thing, everything ha e heard far positive USA part thing like Europe, every country (states USA) rules. Florida one current hotspots looked fine 2 months shut like described around time holiday days later protests started, many people stopped following mask wearing social distancing guidelines. Around time bars allowed open limited capacity (I think 25%), restaurants allowed increase capacity (I think 50%), people allowed get hair cuts limitations reduced figure exactly caused cases increase much. Bars can't sell alcohol anymore Florida since looks like big cause areas added fines increased wearing mask. see next weeks helped enough restrictions needed again. Another big issue week another holiday coming could cause spike more. Oh no, I'm big proponent masks! Wear wear well. good vibes think suggesting dual citizenship would mean parents rich enough well traveled enough meet despite different countries. ???? onus plaintiff prove employer caused contract corona, died corona... 6 bruh??? thought basic tort law taught every university... whole Latin America big trouble save maybe couple exceptions, Africa prety much getting started. minority countries ones ok. right answer. American passport, agree you. makes sad many Americans (ones personally know means travel. understand means I‚Äôm talking them) don‚Äôt care traveling countries, don‚Äôt care learning cultures languages especially don‚Äôt care anything concerning countries don‚Äôt effect them. love traveling, never means fairly recently. 100% agree decision ban us, man, I‚Äôm really bummed. I‚Äôve gotten see much world yet I‚Äôm getting older. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get much chance now. Europe, saved!! period supposed go inside quotation marks way. they're actually Alaskans actually need travel Canada, come try re-enter country. Please add well! That‚Äôs kind level smart though isn‚Äôt it? Could specific industry they‚Äôre in? Like magic, poof, gone away Point remains politically incorrect group protests, COVID rampant national threat. group cause media sympathetic with, sudden correlations difficult prove theory relativity. Lol thinly veiled envy America makes look pathetic honest question, bad idea place hundreds/thousands patients single area, permanent walls dividing them? aware reasons. Call everything crime get criminals. Add tons racism America. math 30% estimate? ""old serological data"" I'm quoting, show 15-20% infection rate population, data less month old. Assuming climbed full 5% since then, hasn't, daily numbers remain lowest country, lets assume ridiculous increase anyways, 20-25%. take high end estimate 25%, current confirmed rate death, we're looking 1%.

*BUT,* account COVID-19 deaths accurately attributed virus. there's way know certain many deaths went uncounted, even something small 15% increase, would bring IFR 1.2%. I'm sure know. Oh snap, point phone's auto-correct, good job big brain. 

Also kind creepy turd regularly deletes comment history lmao. American, fully understand support decision. We've done shit job containment. eyes. Americans going stay America loool.
Good move. Ahh yes third world nation shut world economy nursing home got covid. read sub actively, you‚Äôll find people complain mask wearing NYC. don‚Äôt believe say it, data proves every time.  Oh dear. masks contribute China's success, know. Damn, Native American sad, we're stuck Europe's religious weirdos. I‚Äôm sorry man. Love hurt sometimes Suit yourself.
China 1.4 billion people. Beijing 22 million.
Even Beijing severely affected, still 1.378 billion people living normal lives.
If that's ""doesn't work"" you, I've got nothing say. general, I'd agree trail absolutely packed foliage thick even heavy rain outside trail trickle. Theres less airflow youd expect Im arguing here. listening doctors instead politician.  american, i'll honest, dont passport wont going europe anyways. bother family small town hour train London. hope they‚Äôre safe never seem concerned. Yeah, free universal healthcare, standard unemployment benefit can't possibly make worse here. FFS! way early even figure out? protests started 3-4 weeks ago? Oh never said excused it. live Japan think bullshit policy too. Really hoping Canada doesn‚Äôt open boarder Unfortunately, massive fractures society big fill. sounds terrible, one hand, I‚Äôm glad virus exposed nearly glaring faults. other, depresses continuing ignore said faults hubris. past point return nation really sad.

Apparently, job catching downvotes damn good it. hope find peace whatever makes angry. implants.../s

I going hesitate get it. 98 yo grandma older parents protect. Finds Chef Boyardee said something racially insensitive ages ago...Time rip memorial boyz! don‚Äôt understand.

I've seen enough comments Reddit great misunderstanding epidemiology viral transmission.

A lot people making incorrect conclusion state's ICUs EDs never overrun extent NYC's was, COVID really bad. They're failing realize EDs/ICUs remained empty states made conscious effort shut residents stayed home. fiancee middle school teacher schools planning going full steam ahead in-person instruction August. fully expects back distance learning September. simply fool-proof way prevent spreading school environment, they're already petri dish even without pandemic. Wrong. lack nuance, like typical Reddit. work cases. 

The problem nature job industry, way machinery laid built set highly infective pandemic mind. Many industrial work production lines based around coveryor velts, employ thousands people not. People keep forgetting realizing that. 

You cannot job without close quarters. would rebuild new factories brand new layouts attempt move heavy machine around literally bolted ground. Also, honest, people work may highest education may biological/viorological awareness take situation seriously needed 24/7, slip up. Fuck, even space associated factory floor, like cafeterias tight. factories rolling lunches one lunch time period per day, one person shift could pass someone else different shift touch wrong surface something get cleaned properly. thousands people per shift, fuck ups happen. Plainly out, industries shielded Covid equally. Period. That's real world. way assure current factory format would shut down. Either good long enough major changes could take weeks months done right. That's weeks months without any, highly affected food production. 

Look, hardworking people job, doctors. also slip too, aware biology. 

You give PPE want, always vector infection. like saying, *""How come protective measures used Greco Wrestling seem stoping Covid spread among wrestlers? get it? Fuck coaches!*"" problem lack PPE, problem people wrestling. 

It easy assume shit know generalize Man always trying fuck little guy, do, sure meat processing factories that, always. productive oversimplify shit dumb levels can. 

Source: Spent time working office meat packaging plant know score. Well, there's COVID brain, there's straight-up retarded. extreme delay testing could explain it. month ago, could get test within 24 hours reason all, charge, get results three days tops. Now? checked can‚Äôt get test county two weeks, take ten days get back. tests people first got sick 2-3 weeks ago. said, would expect hospitalizations go up, especially cases booming, doesn‚Äôt seem happening. week ago 225-250 per day, it‚Äôs like 100-150 per day. Deaths increasing, much. 

I‚Äôll add new hospitalization numbers hard find, local news reports them. get Tampa Bay Times almost always includes number daily update article. Newspapers Miami Orlando report numbers must getting somewhere. doesn‚Äôt show net change though, new hospitalizations. 

Florida much better idea many people covid places March April. NYS, example, recording similar case numbers higher testing percentage. agreed could easily multiply numbers 10-20 April, don‚Äôt think say now. Maybe like 5-10? 

The mask order seems kicked red neck town ass. They‚Äôre complying. hopefully helps bit. 

They‚Äôre going shut state option table. *comes first solitaire* problem people *medically* can't get vaccine, rely herd immunity majority population vaccinated. going end situation going vaccinated school, jobs probably going require (they surely want financial toll shut quarantine someone tests positive), they're going make medical exceptions onerous, like multiple doctors sign-off, fair rare people require it, otherwise shitty people fake ""the ADA says wear mask"" cards abuse it, like try abuse every tiny little win people actually NEED ADA spend years court trying achieve. I'M BITTER ANYTHING!!

jk extremely bitter. That‚Äôs crazy. European leaders children üòÇ missing point here. Anerica bad, bad administration woefully performed face global pandemic. 1 one, moving stuck here. Job opportunities crap compared though.

Don‚Äôt forget initial point lockdowns make sure hospitals ready. COVID damaging lungs symptom deeply disturbs little people seem care died. Maybe it‚Äôs many reckon it‚Äôs massive tragedy seems trampled fuckheads can‚Äôt even bothered wear mask explain better could. This. Thank responding. Comment tries imply people problem white people. ""My black people take responsibility this"". cannot believe upvoted. 

Ignorant/careless stupid people come colors indeed see colors wearing ant wearing mask.

Let's turn race issue Smart. Can't blame 'em literally described situation last detail. guess it‚Äôs comfort knowing others situation. math little rusty think horrible curve telling there's federal seatbelt law? Might add disband OSHA federal safety programs then. Sad but, fuck, deserve it. I‚Äôm pissed I‚Äôd planned buy wedding clothes India (they‚Äôll probably ban us too, understandably) fall!! 

I wish non-mask wearers would realize world doesn‚Äôt revolve around them. rest us plans, too! we‚Äôre cancelling staying home much possible. sooner shit solved, sooner go back lives - can‚Äôt decide it‚Äôs fucking bc want haircut! Less ethnical reason mindset reason. collectivism east (where Viet Nam part of). ""the greater good"".

And no, round people put camps. simply give returnee people free housing, free food free testing 2 weeks quarantine. make sure infect anyone larger community. 

Meanwhile, west, individualism, cynical way ""my right higher life"". least west sufficiently rich remedy money research healthcare. 

Anyway, European countries seriously want fight pandemic, consider model Viet Nam. Maybe tweaking bit (say home quarantine regular check up, used South Korea, believe). Quarantine like cost effective containing spread. Plottwist: Scientist use inactivated coronavirus shell deliver targeted cancer therapy. open schools, we'll get riots economic disaster. Seems like impossible open back up. Distance learning failure kids, parents need get back work anyway. thing best control spread. I'd look Taiwan best follow. know it'll hard, try get kids wear little masks wash hands. Plastic dividers desks.

Note, Taiwan never business shutdown. closed schools 2 weeks, opened back up.

The first reason done testing: need get testing par, yesterday, cannot matter much costs. need real leadership get testing right, we'll never manage this. But... But... *FREEDOM*??!?!? It‚Äôs good thing Texas Arizona virus control then. [Oh thank can‚Äôt figure side you‚Äôre referring played. played me? anti-mask camp corona virus real camp? fake conspiracy virus not? 

And think ‚Äúwake fuck sheeple‚Äù mentality contributing strongly make people know believe trust anymore. turn make shit comfort ourselves. wish people would knock fuck vague conspiracy accusations. It‚Äôs helpful. can't go narrative here, allowed. southeastern/coastal states... it‚Äôs shit show. bot level jargon. said saying countries also eat wild animals changing narrative talking something else also BLM. 

Time exists things change time passes. means China faced happened before, different to, US faced. US information advanced notice unlike China, time passed China shared info, yet still US made total mess everything. one worst infected countries world that's China. countries information much better job containing virus listened WHO. Blaming China helps Trump idiotic narcissists thought knew better epidemiologists avoid responsibility dead people. 

I'm also flattered think I'm one political elite lol ‚ÄúAntibody levels also dropped far quickly people never showed symptoms, 40 per cent detectable antibodies eight weeks recovery, compared 13 per cent symptomatic patients.‚Äú I‚Äôm honestly AMAZED took long virus explode Brazil. place fuckkkeddd. honestly wouldn‚Äôt surprised take crown, already leading coronavirus cases. found missing Chinese doctors yet? can‚Äôt let American Virus country. 

Some right wing Euro politician probably Austria Germany. üôÉüôÉüôÉ 10,682! Holy shit. 80% people old sacramento wear mask inside outside stores. Maybe build wall? make USA pay it! also Karens wanted Karen front Eiffel Tower. cousin going college Germany, currently USA came back home state Christmas, able go back Germany college no? commenting see reply. gives one. ever? Yeah, trust Trump. Lol like, tell throat post nasal drip gets going. Oh one edgy 13 year olds. Nice. Pathetic. still controversial Sweden, official position government efficient outside healthcare facilities. almost noone using here. get it. friend Florida healthcare worker already exhausted peak. talk almost daily hear positive news. necessary people wore face mask. Many densely populated East Asian cities never luxury lockdown extensive social distancing, able avoid massive outbreaks... key really **wear face mask**. testing yields positive cases. That‚Äôs one major factor. Also, I‚Äôm thinking hospitals getting better treatment. Hospitalizations significantly California last weeks, deaths haven‚Äôt seen near bump. yeah get can't come back Canada try, ignored fine, arrested. yeah, I'm ok it. expells idiot country. worry. We're angry enough us. American, free nipple. good want shit open. They‚Äôre grouos think excuse worn welcome.

there uptick now. now, next week latest. significantly higher yesterday, day every day that. You‚Äôre saying developed better treatments overnight?  Fucken finally. American, gonna fucken die anyways lmfao cause shitty president important things do. Give dark side force, knob. think Americans behaved much worse towards Indians China towards Uyghurs. Worldometer officially reports 10,000 now... fact say utterly unacceptable. lessons learned, formidable action taken prepare rest country watched NYC get pummeled March. Oh. know that. What's difference? know that, union, fired cause CA. I'm going first one get it, get eventually. Tennessee. I‚Äôd say 20% wear here, that‚Äôs pushing it. went grocery store last week one mask except employees. one cashiers around neck... develop lung damage strong enough immune response prevent secondary infection, definition ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù person gets lung damage COVID weren‚Äôt actually asymptomatic. hope Australia follows suit. Yeah, popcorn ready: hardly wait impotent raging.

Anything EU Lincoln Project (or anybody else) cause huge stroke fine me. 21000 cases today 90 deaths, every day today like 250-350 deaths per 21000 cases it‚Äôs weird Okay.. Okay. Could Frosty baked potato please. comments thread absolutely reek privilege. grocery store clerks quit jobs live trust funds?

People can‚Äôt afford stop working. People can‚Äôt afford stay home. keep going jobs exposing risk people like you, luxury so, stay home groceries delivered. Dang Kevin. job starting October EU country government far it‚Äôs still happening according despite ban guy charge keeps saying everything control one position power wants contradict him.

He made global pandemic referendum him. hope hell people hold accountable done America. Nah, Trump use money bribe us closer election. Count it. anything bad idea. Stay home next 20 years never anything all. masks don‚Äôt really protect wearer, takes one infected person wearing mask spread people are. go shop anyone isn‚Äôt wearing mask properly, you‚Äôre risk. would write paper letter. Paper correspondence harder ignore, believe must make record received correspondence constituents. Re-mail federal senator/rep. also. Also, call visit district's congressional representative (if offices open). staff usually available take phone calls. congressman's office couple miles live. Good luck! Chinese? Fuck Europe. Let's go dissolve NATO let Putin know shit stop them. us live reasonably sane aware worried now. We're serious, serious trouble here, chilling many Americans seem oblivious it. way get out, would. churches open bars?

Someone's logic False. 80 per cent wearing mask unless mandayed law. Actually yes.. no. since borders EU, Portugal allow Americans, Spain would close borders Portugal. domestic European tourism important

Also.. even recommendation.. agreed EU states. 


So no. imagine fraternity sorority membership go way semester. large number students join make friends guaranteed party weekend. parties aren‚Äôt happening, would people join? I‚Äôve seen far many articles people saying didn‚Äôt take seriously close family member caught it. 

Or screenshots two facebook posts, one saying it‚Äôs hoax whatever, followed saying they‚Äôve diagnosed treat nobody exist, checkmate ! teachers family; they're often last find district decides they're expected suck whatever district decides students' best interests. messed say least. picture article says all. big sign ""Please wear mask line!"" course still one line wearing mask. people particular stupid seems US countries numbers high. lmao. ok good sir. Rectally? heard that.

Phils looking good moment, sadly. Picture might change, course, I'm resigned another 4-6 months this. LIBERAL Doctor‚Äôs plea. 

You‚Äôll never hear Dr. Spaceman telling ask science. medicine. really anything all. vaccines yet since tested speak. reason takes long. Even rushed, what's worst could happen? get covids effects toned style.  100%! üò∑ offshoot technology stops Covid testing it? outside.

It really seems like difference outside vs. inside massive.

You entire groups friends getting infected restaurants bars cases linked protests. patient, friend,wea  Nope. Arizona reached milestone today. One percent population infected (or recovered). 

Let spell little better. Sometime March 30th, Arizona got 1,000th case. 

Despite social distancing time, Arizona doubled 6 times 3 months. 

If doubles (5 or) 6 times, (one third or) two thirds Arizona infected. 

Positive cases doubling every 12 days, Arizona reports 63,600 active cases. 

Without intervention (and depending definition ""swamped"" is), Arizona swamped 36 - 60 days... halfway (from 1,000). think you‚Äôll fine. friend mine runs company branch UK place there. He‚Äôs American he‚Äôs right now, think that‚Äôll exception, actual European citizens hopefully totally acceptable. Thanks insider assessment. guess we'll see. Yeah, think they're going redraw plans cancel season entirely. Good call. Thank let re-phrase, biggest change lifestyle implement controls like SK. 

The worst thing happen minor inconveniences experienced SK citizen Actually really terrible, governor told stop reporting figure makes look bad answer obviously approved clinical use. one reasons whole world nervous relying mRNA vaccine novel technology save us. 

It certainly worrisome people weigh risks novel technology vaccine, evidence efficacy, COVID infection think next 6-8 hours.

if get stuck pm people drawn - almost addicted - generating state trouble. rhis point think members US political parties fulfill criteria. See? enough people infected already problem starts diminish.

We stop fighting powerful majestic thing let take natural course. people listened doctors scientists instead politicians

In Sweden politicians listen state epidemiologist, exactly reason mess. I'm not.

People also know ad hominems are, must say fantastic job them. Yes, skip it. Keep mind Netherlands like size two New Jerseys, like distance Denver Pueblo Colorado. 

There's lot interstate traveling, traveling going big cities smaller ones, whether commute work visit friends family. instead one two big cities affected, 50 state capitols smaller cities state spreading disease people want take precautions keep others safe. pity poor Americans can't afford go holiday. Angling future chances people 25 dying en masse horrific virus? feel like matter time them. Good Gen Z. RIP type read it. TL;DR: TMC stopped reporting ICU capacity governor got mad told stop Guarantee black people did.

And yet, still blaming white people. Ironic. People acting like online learning unacceptable education standpoint idiots.

No, effective person/hands learning. really? Think wouldve happened 30 years ago, 100 years ago, places without technology make remote learning option.

Whats that? Timmy hard time listening teacher zoom gets distracted easily? go back 1900 timmy go dislodge gears factory machines. Thats hands on.

Global health crisis luxury option continue education people complain ""wasted time"". Drives nuts Nope. entire world. Mostly US, UK English speaking countries. 

I follow world news several languages. Sime worst reporting UK. entirely focused ‚Äôdraconian measures supress freedom‚Äô paid little attention virus itself. simply interested know ho much new surge expect any.

I political interest protests that.

In reality close minded people anything agree inflicting freedom. Lgbt rights, abortions, immigration, masks, etc. LOT outdoor parties NYC lately nobody wears mask. High season various summertime celebrations. day day people mostly responsible though. still dodge daily weirdos spitting car windows walk/bike past me, that. People hugging, hanging beach, normal things like covid never happened. 

I've seen couple graduations, 1 retirement party, lots babies stores mask. One even crawling floor grocery store. I've seen 1 child 10 mask. I'm seeing people every day I'm playing pokemon go car. 

But yeah, got point. I've gone going store every day two weeks. boyfriend 90 percent shopping. Well logic would apply every state densely populated city mass protests. Seeing doesn‚Äôt, statistics aren‚Äôt backing suggestion. guess longer bars allow full capacity, safer people feel, people go weeks go public full capacity there‚Äôs pandemic. 

Now I‚Äôm anti-opening least. think it‚Äôs good think should. also think restrictions enforced. Like 50% capacity whatever state implements. ignorance affects safety. Done. won't. feeling tried fail. 

And fail, going impact single parents two-income reliant households? hope right losing biggly. People thought going lose biggly last time Near Sancerre, heartland France. Americans. 


But discussion business, students others. one allowed. [CBS News poll: 48% [CENSORED PARTY] use Donald Trump's guidance deciding whether wear It‚Äôs confusing anyone haha! Trust man people help you. I‚Äôve known guys went decades without help got treated mostly back normal now.

I PM‚Äôed say ""and shit"" I'm solely talking bodyweight-only exercise. still plenty things do, buy pull bars, many ground exercises, etc, etc.

Obviously gym machines specifically built optimize lot stuff, absolutely healthy ever without gyms. Let's wait see... face coverings become norm amid coronavirus pandemic, Japanese startup Donut Robotics developed internet-connected ‚Äúsmart mask‚Äù transmit messages translate Japanese eight languages.

It's $40 av makes neat affordable.

Excellent interesting article, OP. reason man re-elected. took title away NY. Florida#1 Nobody saying CCP good, *definitely* better response US government.

Yes, agree tests per capita tell full picture. However difference using capacity capacity.

It's definitely possible right countries ""need"" many tests (though testing never hurts) point might. Iceland could apparently ramp testing, think many countries South America, Africa, etc... would issues so.

Additionally, countries need testing capability right now. Brazil 45% positive rate, Peru 17%, Chile 25%, Bolivia 43%, Egypt 47%. big one getting Xanax Klonopin. Studies show direct link benzos Alzheimer's. felt like beginning knew someone upper area stadium caught measles people field, data simply could tell sure COVID like measles not, high enough risk matters. Also unclear Spanish Flu contagious Pneumonia. 

However see quickly spread occurred areas trying different solutions (by using excess death rates, imperfect testing numbers). Elementary schools outdoor gatherings creating spread seen Italy New York.  Hyperspreading events occurred confined spaces, we've found plenty them. We've also found crowded outdoor events. 

If loose beach gatherings protests causing spread, meeting one person outdoors 6 foot distance, going slipstream another person orders magnitude less likely, like getting pregnant pill condom. zero problem individuals mitigating potential risk, wearing masks exercising alone single person visit outdoors home distance eating food separate plates.  level comfort Spanish Flu level threat spreading like measles. also feel 99% certain data shows level care would result transmission rate less 1, virus would cease exist everyone behavior. Young people like going bars restaurants since places reopened Arizona around May 8. seen surge since two weeks ago. June 14. May 29 protests start Phoenix, May 31 Scottsdale gets looted.

Most news organizations like, ""News trust!"" Fox News like ""All news sources evil liars!"" Yeah know well we're going stay steady. Everyone running around town like corona exist. I'm hoping best expecting worst. zero clue person even is, guess I'm touch. see event even allowed happen. stupid stupid ""It completely unenforceable, people going finance reelection!"" Even better. Surgical masks prevent people spreading virus, protect 100% getting it.

And added that, many people use masks properly. even supposed eat drink regular mask without removing - impossible.

Wow. problem is.. one flipping shit. said china hiding number it.. protest.. finding out.. ok, lying.. like now.. move on.. think people. people currently protesting facemask mandate I'm at. third world Don‚Äôt blame all. haven‚Äôt done anything stop spread virus, fact actively oppose anything would mitigate harm. Honestly, point going something worsening epidemic right?

... right? many items chart connected items? 

I'm going make version chart put random shit bubbles:

Conspiracy theory? real conspiracy attack psychologically cause damage possible. been.

Here, start journey: massive campaign launched Facebook. Remember posts spread everywhere couple weeks ago wearing mask dangerous you‚Äôre breathing carbon dioxide? ones spread Facebook finally deleted? Yeah. Campaign #2 US.

Watch ‚ÄúThe Great Hack‚Äù Netflix. It‚Äôs type campaigns running. Why? extremely effective. Psychological warfare serious. it‚Äôs stemming may even serious. I‚Äôll let put two two together understand against.

Please. Get educated ‚Äî media. reported several false narratives spread bots Twitter campaigns crying loud. Batmen batwomen everywhere. data cell immunity asymptomatics?

Kinda like Ireland's attitude UK WW2: want UK win also mind taking pasting. fact personal 'freedom' important well-being fellow man shows type person are. too. clearly politics science year US. leader golfs 1$ per litre 4$ per gallon roughly. Well, see, European countries mostly leaders willing able lead, citizens willing follow common sense protections good country.

The USA course greedy, cowardly, dishonest, uncaring leadership bunch little brats can't see beyond noses.  people looking foward vacationing Europe? Europeans probably stuck American's selfishness/stupidity? noted EU set restrictions national borders. individual nations set entry/exit restrictions. EU provides recommendations country enter.

For example, Greece Portugal (more dependent tourism) considered allowing American tourists enter. Hilarious. Every qualified teacher know currently working expressed happy position need work right now. They're either retired staying home young kids. None want go back. Teaching unskilled profession thousands people able step vacated position like service industry. requires higher education certifications. Teachers power here.

Not bad really compared many US states. Reminds parks rec guy uses bail put turn movie dome porn place lol see that. China India hold 80% medicine import. hooked opoids. Majority countries animosity towards US, people general, towards war producing foreign politics. humble opinion deer falls, wolves ready. Let's hope avoid civil war, start. apply Americans tourism? friends keep saying testing = cases new cases young people good news everything great. live USA now, Chef restaurant owner 52 years much understand situation. Shamelessly must say, Mother visited US carried tip table pulled every time pay bill. never understood never able explain her, figure 20% + done... Oh! well... gov. can't care enough keep us safe, completely within reason countries keep people safe *from us**.* Stellar rebuke. Really insightful. Still side-stepped question I‚Äôm changed man you. Testing flag positive already positive though. always race condition getting infected next test.

If containment strategy flat work, get flare ups. Personally I'm scared teacher friends. (37 * 5) kids day, five days week, questionable distancing mask wearing. way kids washing hands enough.

We ""have"" open parents need state funded daycare, sure. Without local containment opening schools probably work, testing not. hurts us try open we're ready. think large regions back mandatory lockdown next two weeks. flatten curve before, whenever lockdowns put place, you‚Äôll see continued growth 2-3 weeks afterward require another 2-6 weeks get spread back control. Right every day lockdowns delayed problems 4 weeks get exponentially bigger. Unfortunately political isn‚Äôt yet what‚Äôs right, materialize shortly. Yeah makes sick too. #yanggang concerned that, word-for-word quote. excuse concert. Numbers put out? look actions instead think numbers believable sense.

It's gonna like August 

And bad part ICU FOLKS Stay long time say party inciting encouraging riots? know. one does. data ~6months. Let's optimistic take real toll CNS, definitely possibility. death numbers increase reasonable period hospitalization? Really? thought asymptomatics would still get positive test? American here. Half us disappointed half Trump rally orgies without masks ""freedom"". Wait, could virus essentially cancel brain evolution?? Must consider human intelligence thought due evolutionary changes front line vs others primates Well, maybe worse thought.

We can‚Äôt let virus used means quash public sentiment reduce liberty whole.

As trust you, let's apply science get US collapsing industrial climate cultural decline (Green New Deal). Indeed, ask healthcare workers *they* think growing number cases. Bloody EU regulations July 1st? Americans focused children return school working home. five people care surely disappointed. warehouse constantly tests positive haven‚Äôt closed single day. It‚Äôs mandatory show up. Elementary school toughest solve for.... germy kids, least capable following distance hygiene standards.... also least likely succeed distance learning. part Mississippi. mandatory Oxford. Jackson area pretty good compliance. sure are, definitely lot people wearing masks Mississippi (even alone cars). American living Europe, hate lucky feel. Gotta keep people shithole countries out. washington post said it...must true. Korea Japan rising again, tbf. sure others. mean Pro-COVID alliance  Fucking dumpster. Fuck you. I'm trying immigrate Canada whole shitshow really put question when/if I'll able time next years. Express Entry invites paused indefinitely people already Canada IIRC. It‚Äôs quotes Trump, yeah, it‚Äôs pretty laughable. Similar trend NY. That‚Äôs left anyway.... hehe üòú That's going stop Trump tweeting something like ""I'VE BANNED EUROPE!"" Sorry hear dude. I‚Äôve long distance/international relationships. It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôll pass eventually. maybe meet another country. That‚Äôs fun vaca. I‚Äôve done Mexico border open everything except tourism, people prevented crossing people tourist visas. ‚Äúclosed border‚Äù bunch political posturing. vote rapists. gone back March states take extreme measures educate people instead turning thing political mess. district polling parents.

At least getting courtesy. 

We've received 2 emails Superintendent District plans. single survey, however, gone poll parents think, survey sent Teachers. Board making decisions without input. can‚Äôt talk p*litics propaganda cool?

Shit sub. Shit mods. Shit Reddit. I‚Äôm also type person doesn‚Äôt give shit douchebags like think. 
 
I wear mask everywhere go, glad choice don‚Äôt government checking every day. lived Canada next year wouldn‚Äôt want us either right now, damn sad still haven‚Äôt made back won‚Äôt awhile. could really use good poutine. :( Exactly!

The fucking mental gymnastics ass hats takes justify selfish frightening. It‚Äôs alright. Sometimes forget another human end, especially age bots. entire situation worrisome. either route take going lasting effects multiple generations (think newborns don‚Äôt die reduced lung capacity positive infection). still don‚Äôt know long term effects could even asymptomatic carries. 2 year old son absolutely afraid future going grow in. little guy absolutely wants run around say hi everyone. think doesn‚Äôt break heart can‚Äôt let interact people? can‚Äôt even trust fellow community bare minimum protect family...so going it? Protect family. sucks idk man alternative? 

It comes communication. sorely lacked throughout thing jump. Lack transparency mask laws. Lax guidelines weren‚Äôt even followed. neglected human element course going suffer these. that‚Äôs sense community comes hold up. Instead fighting things. care mental health well being, let‚Äôs honest other. Mental health already neglected society this. wanted get back way society before. doesn‚Äôt exactly instill greatest confidence even want return way things were. regardless. you‚Äôre America live one hotspots hope remain safe healthy. I'm surprised. didn't, pretty much every flight would people getting sick large numbers. thread made morning sad... think know wont open july either. looking forward escaping cesspool Florida becoming months. First summer almost 30 years wont get visit cabin. accurate. I'd leave US US passport enter EU Portuguese. Makes security much easier, especially EU side Thank god. Close tax loopholes corporations, increase tax rates highest brackets, defund disgustingly bloated, jingoistic military sudden it‚Äôs possible. 

American elected officials, large, little special interest shills don‚Äôt give shit people supposedly represent. I‚Äôm well aware it‚Äôs government directly. aware corporations us least indirectly controlling government. well 1%sticking fingers everywhere. well try believe bills heart right place entire process corrupted point companies rushing appease smiling orange god. whatever, want take chance unknown side effects guest. turn rage zombie we‚Äôll put too. Good luck! live NYC incredible every state going through, nothing, literal months prep time. Much better need need fair enough EU countries wear masks much better adherence social distance. Also data 2 3 weeks old. We'll see what's happening fortnight. escalated ~~quickly~~ usually does. American, good population dumb care conspiracy theories. people still allowed go Florida across state lines like nothing happening...lets say fuck leave safe state areas go sitting home sucks, nothing else bring back areas.
What wrong people!!!?!? go one damn year without vacation!! Well...Brazil US 2 things common...politicians care elected actually jobs. surprise Brazil blocked travel US. American, Americans allowed America Good. American wants go Europe √ñh y√´s br√µth√´r g√≥√≤d t√∏ sƒìe yo√º Eventually, sick workforce work force all.

That's thought keeps night. find them? think I‚Äôll keep health family mind first. mention health teachers families mind. become teachers risk lives like healthcare workers. We'll see. start knowing week Texas headlines changed almost 25 days, spike deaths yet. Nationally 1k cases 18 days Offiicial: None us going first place. fast, PM thinking same. Uh sir live Midwest states less less cases 4 weeks row everyone know willingly wear masks. suggest shut whore mouth work us US military stationed europe lmao Wait like forever? long virus like. barred seeing friends Romania forever :( Summary:

 

* city records two imported cases India
* 71 infections among international arrivals reported past eight days, mostly returning Pakistan willingly responded comment, willingly gave information, bitched it. victim complex laughable. Yeah, I‚Äôm quite surprised European countries let us think appallingly we‚Äôve handled situation. American oh well R-0? April 7th 5.7 according CDC...but can't find updated R-0... Texas currently adding 7000 cases per day, historically 1 20 ew cases die weeks professional sports going currently, even US. live? could call round pass regards... I‚Äôm also far left panhandle I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve seen maybe 15 mask wearing people total since al started. It‚Äôs crazy people refuse something simple makes real difference.. shrug *want every state cant fucking countries ? 

Jfc FL DOH state report FL 8500. Pretty sure counted Miami dade twice world. China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia shown us contain really resume kind normalcy. worry Europe go way US headed see this. That's low man. Black people currently living time treated fairly even people sometimes. Damn, first year go Europe coronavirus. talking Trump suffering we‚Äôre currently undergoing direct result right wing fear monger anger it‚Äôs turned into. Would totally expect may severe geo political ramifications Europe. Maybe reduction American military assistance? can‚Äôt imagine trump take well. isn‚Äôt value judgement btw possible outcome. hate politicians could done knew would helped 100 years ago, might given couple years holding hands. seen went Sheriff‚Äôs Office! I‚Äôm convinced thing forehead thermometers tell risk heat exhaustion/heat stroke. weird, man. Almost universally mammals, regardless size, number neck bones.

The exceptions I'm aware sloths, manatees, Ivanka Trump. Good. Cruises polluting anyway. That's thinking it. I‚Äôm Fox getting sued it‚Äôs deserve. question would sued for? probably stay closed 2022. German, same. I'm glad happened EU, once, show balls. individualistic ideology driving force America since 1800's. Unfortunately mentality become detriment evolving society. Use common sense. actually banning Americans Shhhhh.... tell that. That's tell they're American. Oh noooooo... He's got whole damn bird head point would chance. Yea it‚Äôs insane, I‚Äôm surprised. COVID started predicted wouldn‚Äôt enforce quarantine. People would arms forced stay inside Well, wall wall. 'Karen's popping'? Karen popping what? NEED get one accord view virus. come plan, goal. Want know even worse? fact completely over-the-top, drowning sarcasm conspiracy theory post taken sincere. let anyone borders? Globally isnt even remotely over. hope Canada doesnt let foreigners theres vaccine. Freedom spit.

FTFY I'm kind curious Canada follow suit. opened boarders US months now, seems likely continue. Can't that. cleaned scum anything left Guess branch government controls ports/airports. He‚Äôd still dirty definition ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù person gets lung damage COVID weren‚Äôt actually asymptomatic. 

That's wrong. ""Asymptomatic"" means person feel unwell. Signs symptoms abnormalities indicate potential medical condition. Whereas symptom subjective, is, apparent patient (for example back pain fatigue), sign objective evidence disease observed others (for example skin rash lump). 

 

The lung damage talked article ""sign""... objective abnormality observed others. abnormalities signs symptoms - racing heart patient feel doctor measure, abnormalities one - headache patient feels, doctor can't measure, lung damage doctor measure, patient can't feel.

""Asymptomatic"" simply means patient complaining feeling unwell, even disease actually causing damage. obviously thinking yourself, failed understand entire corona situation. Despite rather big news soon 4 months. Good Worldometer list serious critical condition patients. watch drop 2% 1% remain month. April 16 4%. moves I'll start thinking we're going see NYC like deaths. US huge rise critical condition patients number would changed Trump administration involved production and/or distribution vaccine, gonna long wait available anyway. like testing, elite get first testbed masses. suspect deaths also underreported, may know actual number deaths due Covid-19 states years ""Failure comply restrictions could lead $750,000 fines imprisonment six months"" Vaccinate bats stop viruses source Oh father CABG 2013. Im sorry you‚Äôre going that, it‚Äôs brutal. Kind ironic since virus strain ravaging US came Europe. guess they‚Äôre afraid we‚Äôll give back new hospitalization numbers match case numbers.

With numbers far today Arizona's 7 day average new cases 3074-on June 16th 7 day average 1543 doubled 12 days.

Your hospitalization numbers match, June 15th 160 7 day average June 27th 327, doubled 12 days also. ""What know cannot harm me"" it‚Äôs shipment relationship :( never thought I'd hear someone begrudging teacher meager salary work hard enough. Holy shit. American. Thank you. apologize leadership decided give hope don‚Äôt unwillingly cause second wave you. Genuine question, FUCK would choose live America option living Europe? brave EU flipped shit it. I'm Belgian remember newspapers going narrative there's proof necessary etc. got quiet week later report came showed impact EU travel US significant. course, would rather US get it‚Äôs shit together contain option future. 

This entire situation could prevented. flu

Came china. What? could've still originated China regardless eventually got US. That's ok I'm poor European vacation. BUILD. THAT. HEDGE. BUDDY! ""when"" awfully optimistic. Tampa Bay Times article came (it usually lags results bit ton information specific area) 29 deaths today highest ever recorded Sunday Monday (the weekend dip). today‚Äôs article. there‚Äôs encouraging sign, it‚Äôs last week recorded 250 new hospitalizations days number going down. probably getting dicked   Europe well either. countries Reff well Eh, live Houston whole ‚ÄúHouston Strong‚Äù mentality came Harvey.. still seeing people morons taking things seriously. Hah exact attitude got America mess Ok deal border security.

Every nation ppl things they're told they're allowed do. can't fix stupid. clear, people mindset stupid. Yep sad true. way treated Doctor Acton shameful.  According CDC flu season usually early October March generally December February.

This exact amount time flu season amount people even vaccines.

Why treated way? legitimate question. heart omg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ include US military billions dollars spent propping european economies last 70 years? every right kick us out, puts bell cat? County Department Public Health employees able trace new coronavirus bar north Scottsdale. Flores said department asked share name bar.

Because last thing want people know could exposed take precautions.

Granted they're bar they're probably taking precautions, better nothing. Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying, recommended self quarantine. let plane without checks whatsoever related.  MA, schools require masks grade 2 Fall. already see moms posting ‚Äúmy son get wearing one easily, asthma‚Äù.  backwards. think people america following CDC guidelines give shit. also think understand economic repercussions, either. sucks, understand. outside looking America shit show. pawns. American new mistake move away England Yeah probably right. meant quick ""lol look guy wearing mask"" kinda thing.

To honest know guy like talking about. I'm kinda tempted tell people like real Patriots wearing masks, Patriots would want save 33k lives October.  Congress refused donors stock portfolio suffering us meat bags staying home.

We reopened profit, save businesses. Congress could save businesses. Take meds, individual schizophrenia. usa contains virus opens borders Europeans. Likely summer. sure! Many many others don‚Äôt though. Incredibly disheartening  lookout narcolepsy (not necessarily cataplexy). Nah dirt cheap Oklahoma Texas weeks ago. getting gas like $1.15 VG.no Norwegian tabloid mention it, least first pages,so yeah...  well, well,well,
how turntables It‚Äôs going simple end Trunpbisnt office. people agendas money fuel plenty corrupt pieces shit willing bidding money. Yeah think people (including myself) see confirmation whatever want see minimize don't. I'll try experiment. really sell us, meander around loneliness. hang around avocados millennial women, near wine Gen X, pharmaceutical counter boomers. Every night shuffle back storage behind store share pickup lines cry sleep. Welp glad got European vacations way last year. Talk timing American, I'm fucking pissed taken seriously enough Flights expensive, dirt cheap vacation Europe... Oh piss off, live Texas taking things seriously get go. idiots everywhere taking seriously there‚Äôs reason deserve suffer. They‚Äôre thing: people don‚Äôt understand god damn thing public health basic medical science. agree part. believe caring society could outcome conscious effort. also believe conscious effort consists people knowing limits focusing empathy group. Along encouraging others find group.
It's similar complex living creatures work - one cell part liver, another part heart. try become one another, combined create something bigger. try make organization one big cluster? call cancerous tumor. think analogy fits. Yeah. people trying get police funds reappropriated that. already plenty money, thats issue. redirecting funds America corpocracy. Caring individuals consideration. continues trend referring - administrators hospitals getting lots panicked coverage saying they‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs hard process national news mounting ‚Äúhospital crises‚Äù light individual hospitals saying publicly ‚Äúno, we‚Äôre actually fine.‚Äù Very. point system creates value equity, value society. 

Taxation policy billionaires get wealthy education sees cut cut. ""May Have""

I'm honestly surprised. Seemed like ""Definitely"". Obviously done Miami. went dinghy dock throw trash boardwalk packed, boat ramp packed, maybe say 3 masks worn correctly.
It's people intelligence understand endangering everyone. God Forbid say something them, get bowed like guard dog. Idiots lot them. Except absolutely essential functions society require people move about, full - total absolute - lockdown isn‚Äôt possible. I‚Äôm arguing half asses US, I‚Äôm saying hypothetical scenario make go away isn‚Äôt really feasible complex system requires certain amount human movement (think food). Canada Northern border? Americans allowed come celebrate Day? vaccine flu yet numbers still exist. way long flu season 7 months long. wall. hedge. 3 gorges giving dude, stop getting information china taiwanese tabloids. BTW, anyone else see recent report said virus originate Wuhan.. instead say came Europe.. maybe tRump correct, once, saying 'China centric'.. even half! 22 percent vote! fucking electoral college system trash allowed president. find hilarious awesome I'm quite sure lot ""anti-mask Americans"" thought gonna summer vacay back motherland. official info yet?

American passport America 9 months. Would apply I've allowed country? It‚Äôs understandable. Anyone outside looking Americans handing concerned.

Also, nurses, doctors, firefighters generally paid proportionately risk. I'd walk teacher asked go work normal fall.

Yeah that‚Äôs real thing stumbled onto. need leader protect myself? child.

Kind guessing need leader lot, based quality thinking.  Fox News certainly didn‚Äôt hell, major networks also participating activity February March. dual citizen around time nyc went lockdown flew France problem. I‚Äôve ever since lol Watch neanderthals bring day WWII... Im recording ma'am people look stare I‚Äôm wearing mask, would give middle finger.

Probably I‚Äôm family tho lol get anyone surprised this. Absolutely international leisure travel honestly happening right now, period. thing Covid ""under control"" also open borders. It‚Äôs literally impossible end spread without vaccine people getting it, best stall enough keep hospitals open like rich parent. large percentage parents luxury sending kids school. least want starve. fear? People want it, get it. People want to. people get vaccinated feel compulsion make choose to, get vaccinated? Theoretically, vaccinated vaccines work, matter everyone else not. idea everyone forcing people free seems bit off. Reported MSNBC, goes politicians science already one group.

I'm gonna try heading portugal august gambling possibility cartao de cididao enough get since us passport essentially useless. Hong Kong Sunday reported two imported coronavirus cases, involving people coming India. 
  latest patients 12-year-old girl, asymptomatic, 38-year-old man fallen ill. came Hong Kong India Saturday. 
  local cases reported. locally-transmitted case 15 days now. 
  total number confirmed Covid-19 cases Hong Kong stood 1,199. 
  Centre Health Protection says coronavirus situation remains ""severe"". 
  spokesman urged members public avoid non-essential travel outside Hong Kong. Yup I‚Äôm high transmission area. I‚Äôve quarantine since March 14. make one grocery run week early week day morning. I‚Äôve disinfecting everything following health guidelines. alas there‚Äôs dumb asses running around wearing masks social distancing going parties keep breaking records new cases. almost makes want cry think much. miss friends family. miss restaurants shopping. many others like following health guidelines, FINALLY able get back living lives. 

Spoiler alert: Probably till there‚Äôs vaccine even anti-vaxxers fuck us too. didnt travel ban people brown. stupid. ban country's ties terrorists get fact staright. document someone got plane, vs. airport, way airport, etc?

Anybody getting plane getting exposed part entire process, easy confirm like someone left home last two weeks go bar. ridiculous wrong. someone typing California right now. run errands yesterday. Stores let without mask, people follow social distancing much allow hold door open them. Restaurants follow strict mask policies, provide sanitizer entrance, exit, bathrooms, etc... Stores allow small number people many lines get store. People lines clump crowd, keep distance. 

Stop spreading shitty misinformation. great many infectious pathogens cause chronic fatigue syndrome, including joint muscle pain, neurological symptoms, 10% cases. seems much longer list potential symptoms COVID-19.

It's expected severe cases risk 'sequelae'. big question many mild asymptomatic cases develop long term health problems. Speaking American: Good. None disease that's around 6 months, reddit phds pulling ass GOD INVENTED BREATHING. INTERFERE GOD'S WORK? 

/s, except something like actually said Florida local town hall meeting. follow Wuhan closely?  anywhere China?  Talk them. dress question ‚Äúif family member sick..‚Äù shows profound lack understanding happening. temperature checks everywhere. go walk...temperature check. run total surveillance using cell phones. would shocked acceptable surveillance. answer question, 95% cases, would want home it‚Äôs asymptotic light case small % require hospitalization. 

I‚Äôm asking realize China things would never want live. times like allows expedient things. seriously doubt want country things Apparently Florida MAJOR lags reporting. 

I know though. 

It's also lagging indicator. Throw fact actually testing younger cases, may really show time. question gives wide range mask wearing first group.

""Most time"" means 51%.

100 people room could wear mask time could still average 49 without mask. True true. live Minneapolis Mayor made mandatory‚Äù wear masks basically public place running errands yesterday literally got Thanked 3 different employees wearing mask. clearly, there‚Äôs handful us respecting ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù part. Yes weird luchador masks prevent getting tan face. insane masks treated huge issue. like hell people thinking?! longer let people wear masks harder people break mind set. China, Taiwan, New Zealand, Europe either done finishing fight COVID-19 US still deciding whether make masks mandatory. would want go Edmonton? nothing you! Obviously novel emerging threat, point time pretty much everyone 'dismissing' sense. question information relying disregarding various points time.

And course everyone needs take given threat seriously next. People within government public health orgs obviously need take threat seriously long general public does, etc.

What evidence people views evolved anti-Trump sentiment? canadian living NYC friends core whattapps group living UK, Australia, Kenya Beirut time... experienced timing alarm pretty consistent across board week lead time europe Australia bc closer initial hotspots. Why? American. evidence sometimes, pays skeptical RESEARCH (even doctor says otherwise). Lots people take doctors say gospel it‚Äôs mostly deserved people think ill-informed doctors that‚Äôs sad tbh. I'd love hear European politician say they've closed border shithole countries. :) would also someone would likely wealthy travels lot, generally okay trump economics alone

I thought poor, uneducated people like Trump? Reuter‚Äôs good trump dick sucker ... San Jose testing asymptomatic people. want test? go get one. every day, enough _if wanted to_ go get tested. told capacity longer problem here.

The responsible among us use resource e.g. keep relatives safer (re-test maybe exposure + 1 week, take care relatives after).

I see put dent community spread preventative. think assign community contact tracers, ... like week half infected? Good luck. family certainly it.

So testing help schools? Maybe get like daily + results available almost instantly, get swabbed way school. know whether we'll August. popular opinion, distance learning failure. would even go far say disenfranchises vulnerable students. might well keep schools closed extended summer. Unless study politicized. links apparently contact tracers dont even ask came protest feel bad man. rational people like 'believe' maxim survival fittest, build use weapons crush others arent fit you.

a purely rational person ultimately boring person. abusing harassment occurring.

however protesters didnt keep distances. masks dont stop spread.  shorten effective range forward direction spread time ( people next breathing side mask vented air).

and restaurants far larger distancing requirements protestors themselves.

So competing factors work. mention churches nah? Well, guess point Tell ""official advice"" is.

Because they've told us lockdowns over. Funny describe super vaxer, say take regular flu vaccine, etc, nobody asks living. point people discussion trying make point trust early, rushed vaccines ""it's Oxford, bro, trustworthy"" ""I know scientists work seem honest"", reality really Oxford + AstraZeneca + kinds government pressure, sudden people need see diploma.  Sure, put sarcasm pretty thick. core point still stands: Karen Johnson Nebraska‚Äôs world revolves around shopping Walmart going soccer games, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt affected this. make sound like it‚Äôs going holiday Mediterranean. ‚ÄúInternational business‚Äù isn‚Äôt fancy suits first class flights.

I‚Äôve spending lot time cats trying think it. It‚Äôs like society forgotten care fellow humans seems likely vaccine ready market 2021.

Well done trump. yourself, first tweet.  Yeah helping.

Our idiot mayor must ready crap right now. one situations there's winning.

Nobody cares unless family hospital bed. residents Europe. 


No business travel allow.. donating blood 20 years told could accept blood anymore time spent Europe back 80s.
Mad cow say. polling backwards.

80% never wear mask

7% do. Perhaps Trump said Covid-19 would [fade referring memory? [Not Zombieland feature Garland, commenting looked way apocalypse. felony. Lol. teachers. comedian? rules' continued existence homophobic. think numbers matter. 

In terms test positivity rates, Brazil 45% positive rate, Peru 17%, Chile 25%, Bolivia 43%, Egypt 47%. countries serious testing problems.

In terms India specifically, situation better US far so, yes lower test positive rate. However take look figure 1 here: test positivity rate appears climbing pretty steadily 4% six weeks ago 6.3% recently. That's pretty clear sign testing keeping much spreading, concerning. I‚Äôm situation (except I‚Äôm Europe he‚Äôs US) I‚Äôm sure lots us. really hurts see people causing unnecessary suffering can‚Äôt put staying home wearing mask while. selfishness unreal. american, see us third world country. Struggling leadership, court system, health care, production, environment. wasteful lot. Bullets bombs spread droplets cannot multiplied spread previously contact munitions. many birthday parties graduation parties near me. passed baseball game yesterday.

Texas Medical Center deleting ICU date let everyone know bad gotten there. yes . even truckers union come say cities didnt keep streets clear truckers unions would simply stop driving essentials cities since several truckers approached protesters blocking highways dragged cabs beaten.

Fuck yes, theres long way go friend. # 1% right things. Take current deaths, confirmed probable, calculate serological data 60 days ago. That‚Äôs whole lot mental gymnastics avoid saying ‚Äúyou right math wrong‚Äù even **IFR isn‚Äôt close 2%. It‚Äôs barely 1% 1.07% math 30% estimate? ‚Äúold serological data‚Äù I‚Äôm quoting, show 15-20% infection rate population, data less month old.

It‚Äôs[OVER 2 months bud. **Cuomo announced test results Thursday April 23.** aware current day June 28th right? 

By April 27th additional testing come showing [24.7% people New York City tested positive coronavirus antibodies lets assume ridiculous increase anyways,

Lol well don‚Äôt choice considering already passed number. assume 25% want I‚Äôm gonna think you‚Äôre crazy would literally mean almost zero new cases day since April 27th there‚Äôs +100k cases state since then. Would pretty crazy none NYC lol. 

24.7% two months ago... additional 5.3% Completely plausible they‚Äôre 30% two months later. Exponential growth that. Especially packed state like NY. ever take high end estimate 25%, current confirmed rate death, we‚Äôre looking 1%.

Except know past 25%... even current confirmed deaths **impossibly low antibody prevalence like 25%.** IFR NYC of: 

Confirmed deaths: 17,800

Cases: 2,100,000

IFR: 0.85 1%. 

If add every probable death it‚Äôs 1.07%. didn‚Äôt account COVID-19 deaths haven‚Äôt accurately attributed virus. there‚Äôs way know certain many deaths went uncounted, even something small 15% increase, would bring IFR 1.2%.

**The hospitals literally this,

That‚Äôs there‚Äôs confirmed vs probable deaths NYCs covid page. 

17,800 confirmed 

4,670 probable**

yes, *some* people getting missed degree cases getting missed. ratio even close. CDC estimates 20m cases US there‚Äôs 2.5m confirmations difference 8x.

Mixed messages top bottom. Don‚Äôt forget new residents fresh medical school starting July 1st  inevitable. Asian cultures miraculously, course history, developed differently own.

You said ""miraculously"", bullshit. ""developed differently"" exactly cases like COVID-19, learned previous pandemics. hopefully Europe learns getting contact face masks. ‚ÄúI've already trod dangerous ground. We're dangerous ground right now, secrets lies. practically define us. 

When truth offends, lie lie longer remember even there, still there. Every lie tell incurs debt truth. Sooner later, debt paid. 

That RBMK reactor core explodes. Lies.‚Äù - Valery Legasov, HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù Either capacity made somehow places like gymnasium's, schools, empty malls military constructed tents people start dying ambulances, road sides, parking lots etc...

Alternatively could start denying ICU beds old, people already sick (cancer etc). ration care think best chance survival. Grandma dies hallway row people waiting die warehouse. True would also better compare individual regions Italy (Lombardy terrifying 0.16% death rate, even higher provices therein could compare US counties). dishomogeneous Italy US. Outdoor transmission significantly lower indoors, community transmission lowest months.

Its highly unlikely Bournemouth make much impact protests didn't. Uk... considered legally EU transition period ends 2021. Good job!

Actually already know be.

however think overall learned less hazard seemed day one wen seemed like measles.

Well, sometimes do, asked put mask social distance like got assigned 12 Labors Hercules something. best. think way count number people walking store with/without mask bk you? everyone neighborhood wearing masks!

March 21: Statewide shut down

May 5th: Peak number cases (2530)

May 5-25: Plateau

May 25th cases began rapidly decline

June 13th plateau 700 cases per day.


**In words**
We saw *only increases* 6 weeks shutdown.

We *plateaued* 3-4wks

Finally case count manageable level *after 11-12 weeks.*

So 3 month journey get level felt like could open indoor dining bars, 25% capacity weekend. 

This nightmare.

If anything like us, take 3 months shut everything right three months.

I suppose US dollars, meat cheese quite bit expensive Canada. right totally $10 USD; though thousand almost anything quite financial commitment. I'm saying I'm advocating it, I'm saying gun nuts anti mask would like shirts said that.

I personally super guns - husband any, done much shooting anything nerf gun water gun, around lot gun nuts seen type shirts like.

Not every person likes guns US like this, lot people attend gun shows (like craft fairs guns) would enjoy shirt said something like that. would actually it, like intimidate people brag guns. aren't, pretend people freak out. Agree. Difficult since 'novel'. Wish could known rate transmission outdoors. always wear mask, people spatial awareness. find 3 feet without masks outdoors safe, would big relief. Fuck guy. OMG. Send em brig still rules place?

6ft, masks, etc? virus mutated. get wrong think England drag devolved nations arent careful control spread. 

I think Scotland NI handled far better well ROI. How‚Äôs Al Fresco LA working ya?

Also also run white man. someone traveled FL OH, laughable. would put number 5%. Seriously. Hey genius, three weeks ago 50% occupancy. 

If it‚Äôs grown 20% fast, it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable expect grow another 10%


900 beds isn‚Äôt lot getting almost 8,000 cases week. took second got made ""law"" current understanding COVID strike part body blood flows - words, literally anywhere. it‚Äôs either fuck fuck everyone else. Yeah makes sense. problem is, know people reported asymptomatic (85% 291 employees) actually develop symptoms within 2-3 days testing. feel like never see media follow cases. So, could well 85% truly asymptomatic, 85% could developed symptoms days testing.... percentage between. list excluded medications, many meds list. 

I think main list: go donate, give quiz asks taking excluded medications. really depends area. Indoor bars bad thing right now, bars started reopening you‚Äôre seeing packed, huge crowds them. *now* people safe responsible it, personally wouldn‚Äôt won‚Äôt going bar right feel area‚Äôs hotspot people actually follow guidelines allowed open restricted capacity. kills reopen most, feel like actually could‚Äôve success areas treated like pandemic free Believe not, sit-down dining food source. US given 80 million funding Oxford+AstraZenaca vaccine effort. Even though others contributed more, guarantee Trump try call *his* vaccine still freely living outside jail comes out.\\

Edit: forgot add source: Pushing people wear masks really helping. hit hard, real them. people pretending world vacation immune faith/chance/resilience mostly denial strikes close home. I'm Canada family friend nearly die respirator used run marathons sister's family caught tested lack testing knew source was. numbers low even rational friends mine going vacations summer half people wearing masks. We're going surge weeks sure... know people died pneumonia corona? professor I‚Äôd concerned basically reckless students would ones returning campus in-person classes, matter careful are, that‚Äôs population you‚Äôll dealing with. friends education adjuncts (overworked, underpaid, shit job security etc) particularly disturbed ‚Äúplans.‚Äù Please note again, making decisions putting personally harms way, guarantee it. forgetting include GA state group. breaking records consecutive days cases, today hit 2k see us similar worse trajectory Florida. Think it‚Äôs gonna take make school happen tho. going enforce mask wearing? happens kids don‚Äôt it? social distance 30 kids small classroom? Cafeteria? Hallways? grocery stores social distance. Doctors keep room person they‚Äôre checking on. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, understand argument honestly feel awful people front lines. there‚Äôs big difference public facing position one cannot social distance. Schools cannot social distance.

Edit: format issue I‚Äôm referring ‚Äústudy‚Äù concluded saturated fats cause heart disease. Almost entirely fabricated 0 controls. Mass gatherings spread though, many police officers involved protests tested positive That‚Äôs scary. Kentucky well. far, many non-mask wearers community kind respectful, too. I've nod smile see mask go way give six feet space. Yesterday gentleman wearing mask saw mask, smiled, stepped far back let leave aisle store came in. 

There lot scientific literacy dont necessarily think people bad people wearing masks, especially CDC originally telling everybody wear them. I'm grateful people considerate giving people space. even said, probably half shoppers saw yesterday store mask on. People other's faces making things political far community, thank God. mostly good people even ""get it"" - know people worried polite stay away. Back March virus getting serious US, right leaning coworkers repeating things Fox News was. 

When raised concerns virus told:

""You're letting media overhype scare you.""

""The flu deadly!"" 

""It'll gone summer.""

""It's liberal media conspiracy.""

etc. 

They watch Fox News, talking points ones using Feb early March. true im pretty sure entire 7% live Kentucky. see maybe 1 10 people wearing mask here. Backfire exactly how? point. least go back, reclaim correct. That‚Äôs grown ups do. Unlike Trump Soo...the ports closed? mean, rolling back would help. shit closed down, can't go. 

Keeping schools closed would help too. Agreed. It‚Äôs still taking anywhere 3 days week get results back SC. know least dozen businesses waited close got confirmation positive result employee. God knows many people infected within week. think ton people willing close business know confirmed case, can‚Äôt justify loss money waiting results. testing turn around 1 2 days would cut ton this. thing think of, conspiracists thought there‚Äôd secret plan 1% Illuminati whatever bring population million, right. Nothing answer justify governors short sighted villainous.

Edit; I‚Äôm obviously joking. actions crazy 2020, not. Anything possible. mask start Completely agree. I'm disagreeing ""huge"" difference blood type. docs explained me, research negligible best, mild worst. Many studies areas populations similar bloodtypes skewed results making ""A"" types significant. Real question: restaurant dining complete absolute nightmare toddler? small children pulled us habit dining out, freaking sick walking toddler around front restaurant looking rocks something waiting husband text food there. first also super sensitive overstimulation, even baby, stop habit Sunday brunches. 

I‚Äôd like bestow unsolicited advice magic IKEA high chair. It‚Äôs like $20, one molded piece, drag sucker outside attack hose meals. Oh way I've said: virus stop infecting people runs fresh meat infect.  

Then, USA invulnerable NZ remain hole. Houston problem what's rationale people's desire tested?!? seems really stupid, good way turn false positive positive. really upside. symptoms, assume it. get severe, go hospital. would nice testing ubiquitous, part national reopening strategy, right testing gets nothing potentially exposing others. dumb, stupid, dumb? 

Are you? come from? I'm sure would rudely ask that. Would care clarify?

I guess never heard this:

 

To clear, say that's actually happening now. said past. don‚Äôt buy it, ain‚Äôt anti vaxxer it, ban independent newspapers? ban non state controlled media? ban foreign journalists m? Yep. That‚Äôs problem. Government power never gives power seeks reduce it. Anything used combat virus would abused coming years Sorry going current figures, R rate 0.5-0.8 factory break daily figures ~20-30 cases &lt;5 deaths.

I‚Äôm SHOCKED, tell you! Absolutely SHOCKED! They‚Äôll force casinos enforce safety regulations. union pays health insurance. good job never reducing R0 &lt;1, OK know people answer kind question honestly, require negative HIV test within past x months first-time donors? test small amount donated blood HIV, worrying assume doesn't. thought different sub entirely unfortunate DeSantis require masks even _more unfortunate_ taking steps increase mask use.

Unless Gov.

Makes wonder overloaded hospitals.

How think *most* people get information. Could mask wearing population careful going first place, hence morons care way likely seen public. Maybe reinstate old walls. End-game wanted elections, governors want good trump books, childish name-calling, insults drama twitter.

Unfortunately many Americans believe this. People wear masks, true. government lifting restrictions letting businesses open, even though we‚Äôre setting records new cases deaths every day.

Gotta say, big part we‚Äôre poorly, due people. fact see lot wearing masks, doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs shit ton people ignoring what‚Äôs happening. Also good point.

Cool animation Wonder worse information misinformation? know mean imply Tennessee putting misinformation virus. Also good point. Would like go protests since ive back work ive time says one summer? going anywhere herd immunity. Viruses small enough get though nearly anything mainstream, including N95, masks protect others much protect wearer. That's probably bc got hit pretty hard people take seriously parts country. CA steadily increasing, seen big outbreak here, many complacent people think virus big deal. Something tells even outside pandemic people like assholes hospitality workers. 5dfox10112 points ¬∑ 1 hour agoWhere live?ReplyGive AwardshareReportSave

Not really, live epicenter NYC almost deaths 70+ let's pretend disease targeting young It‚Äôs American attitude think people deserve this. Especially high number. Taking trip South Dakota right now, difficult see even one person mask gas stations Georgia MAGA country, course it‚Äôs going cases. president would leader governors would look team guidance.

Instead Trump nothing governors knew own. pandemic team. tests PPE. support received wasn‚Äôt there. states needed ventilators Kushner said ‚Äúthose yours‚Äù 

So think states like WA NY best could do. anti-vaxxers misappropriate data points present false narrative argue demonstrably safe efficacious vaccines.. fault facts illogically present evidence unsupported conclusion, assume person concerned single, abnormally accelerated, abnormally pressured process, somehow process properly conducted. 

Climate change deniers idiots saying ""hurr durr snowing guess global warming ain't real"" look stupid say ""oh brr snowing"" jump throat climate change denier.

I work industry fuck's sake. people calling anti-vaxxers making LOL.

The US thalidomide tragedy stuck guns rigorous safety efficacy testing (actually one woman resisted pressure approve drug lacked sufficient evidence safety). anti-medicine? pro safety efficacy studies compromised face market demand drug treat prevent XXXX Thank much this! Take care well. someone blue area seen little mask wearing outside grocery stores gas stations require it. assure party line problem. 0 masks others last 2 times went night. Mask work Yeah nyc probably half wear street, inside transit much higher. overall pretty good. 1) Don‚Äôt So, tens, hundreds thousands people involved deep conspiracy poison you? ADHD that's reading like unless subject 100% engrossed in. People want know much risk others long quarantine (14 days potentially less something else). also want prepared case disease gets worse much stress things like oxygen levels. also plenty health risks recover (mostly blood clot pneumonia related) knowing virus rule things out. Another reason least got tested sick wanted know likely would pick virus recover (assuming degree immunity would make free help others get sick virus). Lol. Hang on. telling never seen West Wing? 

Only joking btw. get program . . . press needs Gov't much needs press. quote anything. They're allowed spin messages. That's all.

About 6 people nation's press back winning horse... think decisions made? obviously want better America well. natural embarrassed terrible also natural want improve. don‚Äôt understand moving goalposts is. Obviously using IQ proxy intelligence original comment, that‚Äôs IRRELEVANT actual point. You‚Äôre honing something doesn‚Äôt matter, don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre stupid realize that. 

It would like said vaccines cause autism, responded saying ‚ÄúActually, that‚Äôs false. affect.‚Äù responded saying ‚Äúactually, affect wrong word there.

Look data...most deaths 60. USA. CDC table Majority 60. Possibly done done now. made partisan issue, easy get people mantra ""it's flu"".

BUT, we'll see comes Pence telling people Texas wear masks even wearing one solid chunk day. Either they've woken real is, they've seen writing wall support base eroding quickly. I've already seen ""I feel betrayed"" posts though. It‚Äôs reflecting weekend numbers, someone explained brilliantly recently. Numbers always day behind, Sunday‚Äôs numbers reflect Saturday‚Äôs cases. Monday‚Äôs number reflect Sunday‚Äôs cases, less testing general done weekends hence see dip Sunday (for Saturday‚Äôs testing) Monday often lower (as reflect‚Äôs Sunday‚Äôs testing) :) pay subscription. It‚Äôs much. study dumb. stopped collecting data June 20. Average time cases show data 3-4 weeks. Major protests occurred starting around June 1-3 (major Houston protest 60,000 June 3). means data shouldn‚Äôt reflect protests around June 21-23 earliest. omitted relevant data... ohhhh okay

sorry french rusty skimmed article lol wear I‚Äôm forced Ok. Thank you. accurate.

This typical antivax argument. Stay fuck home. No. things debate social contract.

Yes are.

See, able debate this, means debate.

Facts logic lol Way go Florida!! Good wearing masks social distancing.

The mayor Jaws right, summer vacationers important livelihood. 

Now leave mask home start licking random door handles, trust it‚Äôs safe. Genuine question - *should* go credible information virus? Obviously wear masks quarantine getting fever hint cough, beyond that?

Is COVID linked inflammatory diseases, bloodclotting? incubation period 2-14 days took much longer reach US? possible side effects persist getting COVID? anti-bodies disappearing 2 months, happen diseases?

WHO lied, originally told wear masks. We're 3 months pandemic know start. I'm looking CDC's website every question ""We know"". know side effects, know people start becoming contagious (i.e. virus shedding). Active cases\*, found huge clusters asymptomatic people industrial areas last two weeks, odds lot pre-symptomatic. Tbh good. pandemic need friends like that. *had* friend went cross country drive last month wanted/could job moment.

Texted asking could hang husband I. said sure... quarantine others 14 days. Otherwise tough cookies.

Another friend flying/driving (can't confirm which) state visit. Mutual friend asked husband still 'isolating' ask wanna hang out.

Yeah no. Mutual friend back work factory job knows long I'm damn sure hanging someone may damn plane.

Seriously wtf people. take wash summer 2020 call fucking day. union shop, simple. blame him.  Look mess he'll inheriting left.

We're getting party started. get shot decide make decision cut arm cauterize it.

Now, less crowded go Walmart! sure is, I'm thinking people working school. people, including employees, improperly wear mask- purpose - nose count mask wearers?

It's absolutely infuriating. Yeah 70% cover mouths nostrils. Cheers. 120 thousand million. Scientist here. hundreds studies dating back 95 years feficacy masks. studies widely available online.

Isrealis think need nuclear weapons defend tyranny.

That whataboutism, I'm calling anyone hypocrite bringing point. fact can't identify means know definition either counter-example whataboutism.

It means arguing bad faith, beginning started calling unintelligent.

That's fine. want learn people's viewpoints philosophy's, free live ignorance. friend's husband pilot. schedule one month working away home 24/7, one month work home 24/7.

It's people without antibodies risk. already vulnerable due age preexisting conditions risk, favour protecting them. see stupidity limit. Cynical strategy, blame young people vote high rates. Everyone federal level responded wrong first months. Period.

/s Nobody wears one great. Deaths cases still declining. 

The dutch CDC even said dont even fucking work wear one? think idiot 17 million people. Desantis even reelection year, really even much lose taking stricter action. People get 2022. title misstates studies conclusions.

the study actually said spread protests liekly counteracted increased number peopel stayinghome houses reports violence unrest protests.

so protests affect spread two ways increased protests decreased stayed home scared.


for discussion actual conclusions study see discussion 4th July Saturday. 

The rise cases we‚Äôre seeing due combination reopening fast, Memorial Day, enforcement social distancing, reduced occupancy, masks.

I hope don‚Äôt see record numbers week 2 4th, point don‚Äôt know expect them. ended buying cute ones another redditor linked to. ones ugly black/red flannel. Excited upgrade!

Deaths steadily declining. way handled absolutely abhorrent. shining example countries, especially less ‚Äúfree‚Äù countries, use mock democracy.

China lying numbers. Even bet it‚Äôs like 10k death, 120k+ rising like ours. It‚Äôs China fault! Ok, lied beginning, many chances control virus, do? Coronavirus thread without smug Canadian including opinion. help entire article train wreck. curve nightmare fact young kids getting testing great sign either. means asymptomatic, must feel bad enough get test. 

I wonder average bad feel, especially comparison colds flus viruses they've past. Yes. Yesterday hit 21000 cases roughly 250 deaths. Today 21000 cases 90. Agreed, open. first answer better testing. Dammit supposed flee?  now, clear thing little dangerous common flue. believe it, look numbers. 

The way media handles it, would give whole different( scary) impression. agree use common sense, Stay safe, think grandparents, exaggregate blow things proportion.

 healthy imune system, worry. bias level evidence coming China.

The claim ""no link"" epistemologically unsound begin with, tells automatically inherently study done properly, coming proper conclusions. people ‚Äúforcing shitty situation‚Äù millions parents need kids school go work. Staying home indefinitely simply option lot families. kids aren‚Äôt school informal daycares, thus exposed even kids risk, home alone. border checks states though? I‚Äôm informed do. it‚Äôs possible people move freely one state next can‚Äôt make individual policies states. live almost 90% people wearing masks? Tennessee, see 30% mask usage. Letter editor June 15th. 

This didn‚Äôt age well lol nice one guys Seems red state county thing. I'm democratic city western NY everyone wears mask. people live red, rural areas seem poo poo idea wearing mask. Luckily social pressure wear one makes so, find odd pretty much along party lines whether people think wearing mask priority. right wing friends seem think kind badge honor put risk. get it... really hard spend energy complaining wearing one takes put forget it. unsustainable. 

These numbers increasing frightening rate.

How long Florida starts reaching New York death numbers? going individual states essentially destroyed every month so?

Ten thousand cases day single state going lead thousands deaths overall. European leaving Europe, honestly relief. Hope see soon though, it'd mean taken care shit. Maybe put children cages send adults back across border...they'll stop that. short term memory become impaired , sometimes hard focus , significant dosages. Memory like muscle , grow use atrophy without Take look Google state-specific cases. rep/dem color denomination essentially predicts curve you. New York actually poster child things properly. don‚Äôt like near people gets fence infected secret service, 5D chess move mean traveling may contribute spread virus.

Yeah, ""safer"" now, safer safe. Key tidbits:

- ‚Äúshort-lived levels antibodies asymptomatic infections study suggest can't rely herd immunity induced long enough period time impact....That means may need wait vaccine induces stronger, longer-lived response many natural infections‚Äù

- ‚Äúpeople without symptoms shed virus longer people symptoms ""shocking"" suggests need worry transmission asymptomatic people.‚Äù

""Until vaccine, think clear recommendations everybody wears masks."" Canadian, cool good. Europe like Cuba now. finally hit wall can't anymore trump realize ability travel countries barred completely.

Those types likely hate ""Yurop"" anyway, thinking kind socialist hellscape. Theorectically supposed use US passport enter country citizen even normal times.

Yeah, funny I've traveled Austria (my country citizenship) passport, I've yelled US immigration officers upon returning.  
 
And, yeah, I'm living China that's still negotiated. flights available, prices still hyperinflated. good 6 weeks really want get there, anyway.

Good luck employer starts requiring work Thank literally person gave sensible answer Part might also challenge getting education remote learning. dug npr article read couple months ago noted nearly *half* public school students survey attended *single* remote class. early on, really hope things improved. 

If think article, though, alot families choice actually in-person education education. Remote online education might end acting accelerate performance differences kids economically stable households everyone else. Kids houses parents resources flexibility help kids year online classes pull ahead. households see kids go backwards (since time class, even summer breaks, tends see kids lose skills knowledge). 

If decide remote schooling necessary, also clear going pretty much nuke age grade correlation nearly every kid need tested assigning kids grades classes following year. Seriously. set get March, didn‚Äôt happen obvious reasons. set get fall, looks like that‚Äôs going happen either. I‚Äôve always fallback country really needed leave US, borders closed us right now, too.

Fuck. reactivates it‚Äôs once. involved study, added surprising antibody levels fell months infection. said that's normal, since energy intensive body maintain antibodies ""a little bit surprising,"" said, fact 40 per cent people asymptomatic infections detectable antibodies Gupta said, people immunity coronaviruses cause common colds months, may also case coronavirus causes hand, said, ""antibodies whole components immune system play role, memory cells. remember pathogen begin releasing antibodies encounter again, hard detect, Gupta said.

How dim hopes herd immunity? sounds like antibody testing undercounting previous infections, potentially vastly. teach, Trump university?

Let's blame America 2008 financial crisis, H1N1, Spanish flu killed 17 million. blame game pathetic useless. normal circumstances, EU countries would reluctantly admit Americans historic economic reasons.

But, there's also internal EU politics going here. EU coordinate approach third-country visitors order restore free travel trade internally, keep EU borders 27 members open. current US government can't trusted. players vaccine game. Everyone keeps citing Oxford attempt make things sound trustworthy, telling [Oxford AstraZeneca working together, funded US UK say level trust AstraZeneca, US UK governments particular (who f\*cked whole thing lied us) very, low. probably does, also got nervous census.

‚ÄúWhy matters: Azar's rhetoric stands stark contrast President Trump Vice President Mike Pence, claimed press briefing Friday U.S. ""flattened curve"" much surge new cases attributable increase testing.‚Äù

Our two leaders completely blatantly lying public start. MOUNTAINS 100% real factual data (and data) completely dismisses statements. either A) tell public truth abandon campaign/economy push B) replacements, see today next several weeks normal reality knows long.

They claim continue claim great curve flat... TX, AZ, FL, CA, etc. spiking hospitalizations like crazy. Every chart produced shows spike hospitalizations, regardless testing.

Then anti-mask folks defy logic science, masks salvation truly flatten curve hotspots around US.

The path gaining control simple. It‚Äôs proven. Gov large percentage people follow it.

This inevitably lead collapse US healthcare system, strain resources, cost untold lives directly indirectly, destroy economy many areas around US year right actions taken. don‚Äôt forget stock market... think it‚Äôs far death spiral make March look like tiny dip.

It‚Äôs going happen unless something big happens... lost popular vote 3 million people. electoral system broken. Nah stupidity callous disregard others lives. song dance every time. ""Oh cases testing, hospitalizations need watch"" followed ""hospitalizations dont matter deaths need watch"" finally ""100,000 dead? old people dont matter"" rinse repeat. grandfather final weeks, tied bed prevent ripping IVs oxygen tubes. still gives nightmares months later, wish worst enemies any. Fair. give rat's ass lame article says might happen people speak question whether actually anything stop everyone eventually contracting virus.

The virus running rampant. continue run rampant whether ""let"" not. 

It may fail understand nature United States. USA like New Zealand. single country, especially purposes health regulations. Rather, 48+2 contiguous states open free travel commerce them. Considerations (also sheer magnitude population) makes circumstance wholly incomparable NZ experience.

Seriously, Kiwi nothing intelligent say regarding state affairs USA.  much easier relatively homogeneous people isolated island. definitely stay there. tricky part states needed unified response. Without state borders closed, one state diligent another negligent completely undermines whatever progress made.

Unfortunately, America proactive things. citizens changing daily lives unless crisis literally face impacting lives. mindset ingrained citizens caught us pandemic. Also time everyone UI reduced state's regular pay rate unsustainable people. 20+ million people together looking jobs. would bet 20k+ Saturday. think there's still room grow, sadly. Andrew Yang really interesting point this. said can't find data that's know things really fucked. Yeah, guess specified would Trump holds press conference makes Tweet telling governors take shit seriously. loyalty federal government man charge. matter White House officials say, sycophants follow Trump, made stance clear. mean pretty much sums Taylor‚Äôs view, underlying problem lack national testing strategy funding availability tests personal protective equipment still completely resolved, said, hasn‚Äôt enough research determine right frequency testing Carolina‚Äôs decision recommend universal testing rather mandate it, Taylor said, reflects uncertainties. Wait, water bottles bottled water?   Man, girl fire. decision issue won‚Äôt come debate. take weapons

So ideologue. 

You impervious reason willing murder people differences opinion. prefer violence conversation.

This position patently un-American anti-democratic. guess that's modern right ya.

Got it. Trump formed COVID-19 task Force CNN said overreacting. Fox, get facts straight. bout Alicia keys tho Hmmm well mine came dictionary. win again

No I‚Äôm put fair amount stock ability determine right wrong. 


So logical fallacies whataboutisms those. really hard time accepting fact someone doesn‚Äôt think intelligent tho huh Idk Indiana going around 500 cases per day average may early April 350-450 day dropping like rock. peaked briefly 614 mid April, seems pretty steady since jumping 300-500ish. 

Also Wisconsin 539 cases yesterday highest since since June 1 (which low 140). peaked 733 end may seems back upward trend last two weeks. 

The Midwest overall relatively unaffected far. cases around Chicago. March-May nearly US Covid cases N.Y. region. it‚Äôs much spread across country, going steadily outside northeast. kind don‚Äôt see point question. passing buck individual restaurants police puts ones good job enforcing rules market disadvantage jerks want wear masks act like toddlers faced rules go less responsible places... federal state governments stepped made wearing masks punishable offense (fines like) puts businesses equal footing. move 2000 miles across country earlier month----it unavoidable set motion COVID ramped up. either move homeless jobless (as accepted new jobs across country, notified landlord ending lease, notified current jobs intentions, already signed lease new place across country). 


All say: sometimes necessary. tried safe could, please assume everyone traveling frivolous reasons. RemindMe! 6 months  hospital network?  bad far think clearly much stronger argument could made falls 10th amendment. 

But what's reason national covid policy? superior state state approach deal situation exists ground, rather one size fits approach? Facebook finally noticed advertisers,
but Fox gets free pass. Shh might scare shoppers. Got keep economy going. F indeed can't lie polls dude, rules first half, gonna lie. Well done! Thats frustrating. FWIW, think unreasonable baby. Ok, absolutely insane. lockdown then?  man fuck WHO... offense, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going get buried downvotes saying this: belief represents number one problem US pandemic thus far: think know better doctors scientists.

The expedited nature vaccine celebrated, reviled. reason wary. Yes, expedited, still undergoing full Phase I, II, III clinical trials. Yes (but all!) running trials parallel, there‚Äôs thorough vetting happening scientific medical community.

And yes, trusting expedited every bit nutty nonsensical 5G anti-vaxxer nuts.

And you‚Äôll inevitably help spread virus selfishly refusing vaccine.

I find every bit wrong refusing wear mask. isn‚Äôt personal decision affects you. responsibility community vaccinate help prevent spread SARS-CoV-2! basically wear mask unless you‚Äôre area nobody else is. die. That's ENTIRE PURPOSE ""flattening curve"" 4 months people still get it.

They look total case count curve say ""it's flattening!"" supposed look hospitalizations curve, least active cases curve.

You want peak stay healthcare capacity. Total cases helpful number. Yeezy/Kim 2020  needs health care anyways? missed that. ayy yigh yigh... could 16 40 days then. wow, terrible. I'm sorry. hope make this. body deserves pain forced upon people. feel really stressed too, promise you, hear you. Upvotes upvotes, people like upset you. absolutely control it. 18-44 huge age range. lot people getting sick forced back work. Well,you see...if supporting blm trash, there‚Äôs way spread virus. Stop racist. /s transmit family I'm sorry, comment little bit lovely also fucking dystopian, jfc? fuck wrong country...

I'm gonna hold little hope heart two make through. like really know haha like kids susceptible anything? read much children getting honestly know Masks aren‚Äôt mandatory outdoors UK believe it‚Äôs lot less loaded issue there. Many states US require leave apartment believe   I'll wait years Death Expertise pretty good book. never understood people saying young people getting virus optimistic sign. 

They take virus back home parents grandparents, ar higher risk becoming critically ill. 25.46%-28.97% death rate, similar SARS. running numbers actual data real projections based real data, virus deadly. It‚Äôs sophisticated virus attacks human body many different areas. high replication virus body causes virus overload shed host. virus also rapidly adapts environment hence different mortality rates infection rates however rates accurate affected limitations testing, interpretation data, perception virus itself. Cochran reviews pretty big undertakings, takeaway still don‚Äôt know. Nothing human nature act ways preserve lives. That's saying ever, responding wrong person. No)  Cool opinion, bro.

Prove it.

And, people reason beliefs reason time. Religious people become atheists every day.

Just becaus can't reasoned fantasy world beliefs mean people can't. Americans selfish sacrifice anything anyone. ""I get mine, fuck you"" basically country's motto. man im sorry hear it. Fucking virus......self isolate tell boss whats keep doc speed dial case man.... Strikes send great message teachers lose pay strike. New York here. really hope figure out. district large urban come plan yet. usually kind immunity rates requires aggressive vaccination, like happened small pox. Umm say, ‚Äúall businesses...‚Äù Pass onto recent studies offer indirect evidence universal mask use, even worn people feeling healthy. One study, published late May BMJ Global Health, looked people households Beijing one person confirmed COVID-19. time, explains study co-author Raina MacIntyre, research already showing majority transmission virus happening inside households, China already culture mask wearing. ***The study found households everyone wearing face mask indoors precaution knew anyone lived sick, risk transmission cut want talk anymore scary. relative law (well two) many risk factors including age mild cases.

Odd stuff. Whoa! Shut Sorry. go that.

I‚Äôm sure downvoted though. simply curious. thought extra 600 runs 31st July (or whatever last payout week is). Economically, August &amp; September going look...interesting say least. places not, people still taking asymptotic cases account. Larger gatherings people still bad idea. tho. 

Yesterday's number area 300 something.

The article updated today - claim one sentence yesterday part update silly. Escape planet quarantine Jersey City this.  
They already made ~3 block stretch pedestrian-only street ‚Äúrestaurant row‚Äù atmosphere it‚Äôs successful years. 
Now reopening they‚Äôre temporarily blocking even street, things like taking half 2-way street make 1-way. 
Pretty much every downtown restaurant requested getting bunch nice spaced-out tables outside summer. United breaks guitars faces without discrimination. I‚Äôm lucky people (at least expressive ones) circle also pro-mask still post. week, test positivity rate 14% US special snowflakes population. mean lot. isn‚Äôt wrestling, show. It‚Äôs ridiculous would expose getting COVID almost died year ago. Yes people chronic conditions may immune second wave we'll even immune compromised. bakery refuse create made order cake equates making statement cake. freedom speech allows refuse service. 

Just require Jewish Person bake swastika cake gay person make anti-gay cake, cannot force person create work art makes statement disagree with.

So, thing slightest. However, business refuse service non protected reason, business within rights refuse service wearing mask, regardless state federal laws regarding mask requirements. derail comment, fellow bespectacled one, want know shaving cream hack really helped keep glasses fogging up! Gotcha. Well enjoy day. I'm heading out.  tip, trolling microaggressions privilege stopped trendy like 2 years ago local Walmart good representation America whole, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre looking 25% less wear masks... interesting husband lost bunch excess weight people started treating us though we'd lost *too* much, even though, numbers, actually enough. suspect that's course covid able mild rather hospitalized, however, feel fortunate. (I'd lost 100 pounds course year couple years prior.) Initially, desire keep playing college, television exploded, became entirely money Fuck dude, I'm sorry. Lifting life me, struggled like crazy lockdown, can't imagine must going right now. 

Hopefully able recover soon, crossing fingers long term damage bad. ORMC near capacity according employees. That's bad way looking it, honest. Personally, I'm fine paying people's health care regardless stupid were. I'm comfortable taxpayers dollars go hospitals help save patients would car accident drunk driving, absolutely fine giving non-mask wearers treatment COVID. Shh... mentality every kid mean even beyond covid sick people could work wore masks illness spread pretty minimal. Oh it‚Äôs like entire week absolute drunken mess. It‚Äôs going literal coronavirus breeding ground. patently false cherry-pick cities show want show, likewise, someone look Miami, Houston state protests led explosion cases.

It change fact protesting without masks (like many doing) irresponsible AF claimed safe. result years false logic country freedom means whatever damage want others. Exactly There's plenty person can't Zoom. Trust me, attempted ""distance learning"" spring Kindergartener wonderful teacher spring, disaster. loves actual in-person school; distance learning daily battle *hated* pushed back every step way. really struggled stay engaged Zooms, particular- almost did, could see screen.

So please lecture people ""no difference"" in-person remote learning young children unless actually attempted it. Kindergarten parents district, especially kids need IEPs, really struggled it, ultimately kids learned little last three months.   it‚Äôs outfits nearly everyone wearing mask, yeah. 

Indoors, without masks, doesn‚Äôt matter call it. It‚Äôs high risk. Opening bars seems pretty insane even masks +/-30% truly deplorable trash. JAMA YouTube interview one US leading infectious disease specialists said study news videos videos 25% people weren‚Äôt wearing correctly. It‚Äôs widely said multiple agencies isn‚Äôt distinction mayors telling contract tracers ask people protests way back February, yeah facts bad right? something never hear anyone mention protestors young people already home isolation months beforehand. seems likely protestors simply werent infected begin course wont big spike. expected get downvotes without substantial engagement satire it, trying bait would gone lot harder normal them, wear masks public pandemic times Crowded closely together...screaming lungs out...with masks site. honestly would shocked rally somehow *wasn‚Äôt* super spreading event. Imagine angry tweets comes lol Oh boy, country fucked right now. 15 years data SARS, long-term health damage survived ""mild"" cases, terrifying. needs pandemic response team? r/unexpectedseinfeld It‚Äôs 9000! Studies shown people chronic symptoms wide range viruses, although differences coronaviruses H1N1 agree happened 1918 pandemic sadly relevant.

This article talks Wait genuinely thought Gates working virus??

I think really people stupid.

God damn. r/politicalcompassmemes represent  Whats preparty parking lot like these? Im assuming one? racist statues erected favor pro-slavery leaders hundred years lost civil war right slaves. Wow! dumbest comment day. lot. new happen virus. majority people experience long-lasting health issues, normal medical tests. lead lifetime medical gaslighting, especially woman. really sad many people experiencing time, hope people raising voice time highlight issue medicine take seriously. waiters wearing masks protect patrons. Masks little protect wearer. server feel like I‚Äôm getting fucked right people fun beach vacation pretend like nothing‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs even texas. live Sacramento, California older people wearing masks 20-30 years old bar goers refuse wear mask data? trust science, no? definition ""recovered"" survived 3 weeks past diagnosis. No. health nut, ate organic, ran, lifted, yoga. Healthy body fat %. smoking drinking.

I think understand fully makes people risk yet.

Oddly, family member mine multiple risk factors super mild case (thank god).

I really thought get it, would quickly. year last two sick days work. Almost 1% infected US. million go. people fucking understand math science Yeah, I'm speaking I've witnessed personally clear impact coronavirus depends way many factors definitively point one single thing say ""this problem!"" guess I'm thinking lot differences observe real life versus people describing states online, try figure contributing factors might be, work together. 

So think plausible places protestors mask up, we'll see spikes. area, protestors mask up, see much increase. Therefore, bit reductive blame current spikes entirely protests clearly account real differences regions. 

At rate, protests rare small events compared many people pass busy bars restaurants hours every day week cities reopened. protest visible unusual large gathering people provides convenient target, thousands people go restaurants/bars/stores regular basis, still expect spikes driven reopening protests. 

I used live Southwest totally get saying summer weather! Again, that's probably major factor MA's current downward trajectory - people readily wear masks outdoors implement unpleasantly hot. always carry multiple masks go change every hour so, even would unfeasible soaked fifteen minutes, haha. wonder countries SE Asia like Vietnam Thailand handling things, given they're tropical places still low COVID numbers. Maybe looking help figuring response southern US?

I find interesting analyze speculate causes COVID responses vary dramatically place place. kind annoying people go ""protests it"" that's reductionist view deeply complex scenario. hope loved ones stay safe possible really hope political leaders make correct decisions things become even apocalyptic :( Interesting. videos saw made look like locked up. Uh what? I'm pretty sure riots due wide-spread abuse injustice. agree obvious, however, personally find annoying people say Coronavirus Coronaviruses before, Coronavirus outbreaks like SARS MERS. I've heard current virus called Wuhan Acute Respiratory Syndrome (WARS), that's name virus illness cause SARS-CoV-2, feel WARS would better way explain situation without people straight calling Coronavirus.
Hell, could even give funny cool name like SARS II: Return Bat shit like that. I've 5 measles shots. Still immune.... original response removed allegedly political I'll say could've fully behind protests looked [like Somebody told me

The virus gonna roll me

I ain't sharpest tool shed

So went bar

And got shot vod

ka drank ICU bed masks Americans. every nation culture moment. humanity general. Hello there, name City Houston, Floyd buried. We‚Äôre, uh, well whole Covid thing. ICUs operating capacity. "" fact, scientists suspect virus causes respiratory failure death damage lungs damage brainstem, command centre ensures continue breathe even unconscious. ""

OMG fuck virus think it‚Äôs regional thing tbh. I‚Äôm New York, gen z ofc, grand majority people know age taking pretty seriously bummer one hand, good know feelin way. ü§úü§õ one could predicted think don‚Äôt know yet. feel need point lot people went protests likely lying it. Earlier month, several viral social media posts telling people tell doctors protesting supposedly could denied health insurance done bar sales alcohol 50% vs food sales, can't patrons consume premises. knowledge, liquor licenses allow patrons bring alcoholic beverages bar. exponential growth isn‚Äôt usually ~ 10 days numbers double measures aren‚Äôt put place stop spread? They‚Äôre already screwed next weeks want get handle thing they‚Äôve got taking things way seriously. They‚Äôre reaching NY‚Äôs record case daily totals came *after* NY locked down, meanwhile Florida runs full steam ahead. Data point? Like surging young people? giving morons platform? 100 people. speaking one. saw video idiots husband berating Black officers weeks ago. equals shit. equals shit. anyone giving voice? understand. could get 100 people protest ANYTHING. 1000, maybe newsworthy? Definitely ‚ÄúA‚Äù effort though. Woah impressive made NYC numbers looks small max hit like 6k criteria state make list positive test rate higher 10 per 100,000 residents higher 10% test positivity rate seven-day rolling average.

Tbf, think states cooking numbers already. I‚Äôm feeling cynical. far know church like cult. bad argument... say virus wasn‚Äôt spread mass gathering kind shameful. course spread protest. Get it. Color sad Houston. work spa today slow. ten clients. Hopefully boss closes soon PPP loan ending choose close instead forced close affect business ability negotiate landlord? don‚Äôt need sensationalize 

Oh 2020, course need sensationalize everything. Exactly, also specific paid sick leave legislation passed March New York. individual fired - guarantee payment (unless employee mandated travel employee work purposes). infringe employees federal rights FMLA Ninja culture! gotta think morbidity too, mortality. wont matter many scientist say u half population refuses listen em..... key problem.. seeing that.

Yes absolutely are. difference mainstream media focusing areas... maple syrup damn good! Yeah! Lets family gathering!!!! great! We'll BBQ, laugh, hug, gather around table. going much fun!!!!  Current estimates somewhere .25% 1.25%

So wrong? matter either us think.

It matters prove. articles dont suggest problem. believe ppl would twist information already mindset. getting situation control, nice see Canada looking around see help others. That's global leaders do. I'm proud admit I'm also little bit jealous. remember pride used feel believed lived country. joke‚Äôs you! increase many friends head back TN! 


Yay. Inadequate like disastrous. Haha, STDs condoms. think that?! Genius. Pure genius. We're 20.1% Arizona people still keep telling tests = cases. Fuck state. stock market economy they're waving hands hoping it'll work out

I feel like that‚Äôs schools‚Äô reopening plan. 

As teacher buy Clorox wipes best times. pretty much doubt we‚Äôll provided many cleaning supplies. Total normal, non-hysterical response.  Man, coronavirus video game, gamers would toxic amount lag (in numbers)! They're last ditch effort keep folding. financials wreck, took loan chance paying back, barring miracle done next summer, possibly even Christmas.

But feel sorry ALL. company spent better part last decade buying back stocks instead building rainy day saved last bailout way back ancient year 2012. Btw bought back prices $30-40 per share, spending $12.4 BILLION total. AAL currently trading little $12 share, meaning greedy fucks, idiocy they've thrown away 8 billion value could using right instead death rattle loans they've taking out. problem chart tracks data period us lockdown. also assumes growing number young people die going kill grandma. also show many need medical care many healthcare workers infect kill process.

Yes, people die time. vaccine treatment Measles Polio Smallpox Typhoid Malaria one began running rampant across world, would shrug say ""eh, people die!"" get car wreck next week can't get icu bed full covid patients, shrug say ""eh, people die!""? 

He mandate wearing masks. should. Thank you. well. even remember wrote lmao.
But get deserve. main cause spike, would seeing exact spike happening every city protest. seeing that. fine big don‚Äôt think that, really really screw get high. Maybe ignored occupancy rules, didn‚Äôt enforce mask distancing must multiple complaints? Idk, doesn‚Äôt say article I‚Äôll see dig deets us Someone needs tell FOX news!!! fake news. tell everyone!!!

How explain health officials New York going way *not ask* infected people attended protests?

I want hear logical argument one. Seattle checking in. didn‚Äôt even think factor ordering takeout. Looks like it‚Äôs back cooking me. said many state residents aren‚Äôt social distancing wearing masks, they‚Äôre still coming together large social gatherings.

What happened staying home help healthcare workers? Mama Mia! advantages authoritarian, one able enforce lockdowns quarantines.

So what, 20,000 new cases 72 hours? Jesus christ. Sure, I‚Äôll give though I‚Äôm sure pool parties bar positives Michigan younger people. data still supports argument, yours. Better leave public health experts. made comment another post wife reservations campground 4th (reserved beginning year) told family canceled due spike cases.

And we're immediately outcasts. supposedly 'living fear' now. complete lack understanding astounding really creating tension within family, sadly. hermits freaking whatever fuck need INFECT OTHERS. includes quarantine fine. That's things work. Go NEED cancel unnecessary trips. Great hear..yes, great time people lose wait. ultimate motivation. feel like Ashley would much better name Karen stereotype.  Karen's normal hardworking gals book. Ashley's though ... yikes.  Chesters. I‚Äôm 100% behind message protests. said, way mass gatherings thousands people neighboring communities come together chant together least partially responsible surge cases. I‚Äôm sure parties, bars, restaurants too, claiming protests haven‚Äôt helped spread virus naive. What's over/under many days hit 20,000 day?

One good thing, went Publix everyone 2 wearing masks. brother went Walmart said 8/10 wearing masks. Seminole County. muh $$$$$$$$$$$$$ means use brains analyze information given us blindly agree things

You explain me. death rate .26% .3% NYC died it? really. US government warrants allow government buy companies stock next years. 

I rather implying government could take regulatory action demonstrated airlines' current measures inadequate prevent spread. know anyone personally it? That‚Äôs I‚Äôm asking. it‚Äôs deadly awful easy catch disease that‚Äôs ever known man, know anyone who‚Äôs know anyone knows anyone else who‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs would like know - anyone affect someone know personally? central theme everlasting spoof take sample size group Americans overweight Find articles studies showing protests increasing cases, post instead bitching. would go aganst sense biological denial preffered flavour reality. 

I half expect downvoted hell stating obvious fact. 
I liberal can't reconcile hypocrisy damning 5G crowd morons putting others danger, somehow making delusional magical virological exceptions BLM. 

Reality work way. Neither action done groups smart. you, whoever reads feels intense desire downvote, remember, nobody, downvote me, can't downvote reality.  Forreal? fucking dumbass bet people Texas feel pathetic now. happens fucking losers cant wear mask cause hur dur freedoms. Americans dumb dirt swear shit. exponential growth play combined nobody anything. like early days, growing speed. contrast early days, better testing. American dream contorted wealth. richest. many people seen argue lower taxes rich ""For get rich."" I've seen many times...

The American dream find true happiness, people need billionaires that. please behave sufficient data SARS indicate sufferers hit lasting illness short-term infection. ""vast majority"" hyperbolic; people think that. need acknowledge long-term risks infection lead to. yeah probably NYC maybe testing 1/3 symptomatic cases peak though best apples apples comparison. way plan dining anytime soon. seems irresponsible. also se Michigan bars restaurants packed.  know people afford nanny‚Äôs? Malls gyms. real though, Trump handled whole pandemic like he‚Äôs Team Virus. Failing respond federal level, refusing wear mask (which turned whole thing political issue), phasing press conferences focused virus favor focusing economy, egging ‚Äúreopen‚Äù movement. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs actively trying bad job possible. Fair point. believe doubling every 10 days trend states like NY back March. looked Florida‚Äôs numbers they‚Äôre blowing away üòê good trust one chooses chin strap every sure protests biggest factor. New Jersey NY seen spike cases again. Hope rest world closes travel from/to US then. Yes. read comments constant refrain refuse ""live fear."" Wearing masks makes feel afraid. virus makes feel afraid coping mechanism completely deny problem all. Young people likely go bars restaurants without mask. 

Literally hard data back up. comes night Asymptomatic isn‚Äôt exclusive protestors, far aware would constant % total case population, regardless underlying connection protestor demographics. 

So difference variable two anecdotes specific protests use masks. don‚Äôt disagree large group gatherings ideal community spread, disagree root cause spikes. many simple/fundamental individual actions could help hinder community spread occurring everyday, vast larger portion population participated protests. regional ‚Äúoutlook‚Äù subsequent ‚Äúfollow through‚Äù much larger impact sustained spikes sustained declines group events. everyone took serious respected health peers neighbors would able go lives much closer approximation ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù instead purely reactionary statistical trend quantifiable 2-3 weeks actual occurrence. Super duper. We‚Äôre seeing rapid rise cases 18-34 age group. first thing thought protestors. beachgoers. jailed everyone, sure, also put entire city millions people quarantine let anyone out.

Good luck trying US. hand sanitisers chemical disinfectants cause cancer? Going shops walking around city really irritating nose eyes days - everywhere people mass spraying disinfectants. smell nature outside totally replaced smell inside hospital ward. literally hurts throat eyes, disinfectant aerosols everywhere. that. 20.5% Florida's population 65 years older. yet people pushing masks snowflakes  probably allowed people within 6 feet, big no-no.  either learn easy way hard way. Unfortunately, many people country choose former. Cognitive dissonance --- similar many thread two Tesla employees let go refusing return work personally blaming Elon Musk decision.

Trump never took serious, Fauci did. There's another example lack unity.

No one wants admit CDC's school guidelines realistic (if any) classrooms. Trust me, feel frustration; I've heard nothing daughter's daycare.

Seriously, need stop whole either-or mask bullshit. Masks effective reducing rates infection, excuse whatever want, whenever want. California, first stay-at-home order United States spring, allowed businesses reopen weeks ago state felt virus control. seems changing: California reported highest single-day total week announced 5,600 new cases Friday.

True, lot blame rests public they're supposed doing. I'm sure author placing blame leaders (Leaders Failed Control Virus). Oh boy, getting tired good news lately problem Mexican government doesnt care citizens, never have. someone gets sick either die, come america treatment. Hence sudden massive spike boarders. 

China releases deadly virus (accidental otherwise). Radio silence.

Latin america decimated covid. Radio silence. 

Trump tweets likes frosted flakes. 24 fucking 7 media coverage. 

At point acknowledge news media isnt actually news anymore MSNBC basically presitgeous TMZ? Impatient petulant adulation acting like entitled selfish children. Masks difference. Starting Monday mandating mask. hopefully help spread. They‚Äôre several sandwiches short picnic. absolutely clue masks become political issue US. Yep. decades something new comes again.

Not shouldn‚Äôt lock coronavirus. Obviously should. context key. Check data, past weeks saturday highest number day, lowest day typically Monday. think see 15k sometime late next week thing scared still scared *keep moving forward*. crisis pass, like every health crisis history, 100 times worse, Spanish flu instance. take time, vision athlete you, stick it, whatever takes achieve vision. Hang it'll soon. let doubts win you, accomplish anything, let control you, control them. depends are. states never opened bars recently allowed limited indoor seating restaurants. Massive protests month didn‚Äôt help either. LA cases rising.  taking tests? charge? people can't afford testing able get one free? Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure Nevada Gov pressured opening quickly too. original plan casinos/clubs opening last. are! Casinos clubs fully opened! even possible dine-in safe employees? customers can't eat masks on. Theatres.. forgot theatres. Indiana reported hundreds cases today. week lifting restrictions. businesses open full capacity... Please cite sources that.

The symptoms hypothermia due lowering body's core temperature effects body brain. nothing viruses, let alone ones carry around inside activate get hypothermia.

That really scares shit reason. fight brainwashing.

you this! mean cool least terms NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB none planning fans year next year. insurance Trump administration way; trying hard eliminate pre-existing condition protections ACA. So: good luck ever getting health insurance again, every American gets COVID. It‚Äôs definitely won‚Äôt. intern sheet graphing paper could plot points. I‚Äôm fully aware virus dangerous variety reasons, outside age preexisting conditions.

It‚Äôs important understand context case-by-case situations, however feel troll. either zero empathy give damn anybody themselves. Nothing say get person like that.

I'm sorry plight. put impossible position fair anybody. wish system supported teachers more. obscene much put 'for kids'. martyr; without covid, teachers deserve better. I‚Äôm 25, elder middle millennial? wear masks time even restaurants bathroom. Honestly playing around, replace first group people whatever want. People go bars. Partygoers. care - point protesting pretty important there's *any* reason outdoor gathering pandemic can't imagine better reason fighting street executions. Yeah, opposition completely side science, math, basic facts logic. try quarantine well.

So ideal situation 100 people wanting travel, 70 go ""fuck it, much hassle"" 20 self-quarantine gigantic dicks. 2/3 total population default (which would appallingly low, seems possible), would improvement 23 people already. bad. read worldwide 10 million confirmed cases 500,000 deaths. That's 5% death rate. either massively undercounting confirmed cases 1% number low. I'm health expert since know virus complexity immune system, saying probably anything. There's hypothesis makes covid cases severe mild, conclusion immune system goes much, causing blood clot. maybe ""slower still functional"" immune system (again, health expert here) actually good virus 10 million (recorded) cases. That's 5% death rate recorded cases, likely much much lower- knows? Sorry I'm Barcelona disagree. lived life even 1 5 way much. Maybe touristic neighbourhood? Mine seems relatively back normal, obviously less revenue going ahead. That's especially scary people job never return to. family friend mine, dad firefighter tested positive. Fortunately dad fine told self quarantine home 14 days. mom 2 children living house told need tested don‚Äôt need quarantine themselves. government combating deadly virus outbreak ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù Americans. 

The time flattening curve bought needless death sacrifice shutdown squandered. government supposed get act together time....but nothing, back seeing record high cases death count. change people become numb. sure upset government‚Äôs ridiculous level incompetence it‚Äôs abject failure. Kids get virus anywhere near much adults (maybe 8 times less). top that, far less infectious adults (maybe 10 times less). two facts related need multiply numbers together (chance get virus \* chance infect others) work odds getting virus (80 times less adults). World wide incredibly school hot spots (I read all) children infect children.

So children comorbidities (comorbidities includes obesity) safe houses. cannot remember seeing one article non-obese child without comorbidities dying.

So, worst spot schools teachers staff rooms. Stay there.

But kids safe.

I hope makes feel better. regular weekday, possible find spot crowded. 

On Memorial Day weekend, possible. Every square meter beach crowd people. 

On July 4 weekend, possible. likely crowded Memorial Day.

But, said, beach larger part problem. restrooms, shops, bars, restaurants, indoor places transmission seems common. 

They (and will) crowded, too. Sweden ranks 20 daily tests per 1K, since didn‚Äôt bother look graph.   long-term care facilities reported nearly 6,800 fewer residents testing positive COVID-19 nearly 1,400 fewer deaths among residents Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine released publicly June 23.    
  health officials say discrepancies reflect underreporting long-term care facilities required submit COVID-19 infection data daily state since last last month. described everyone local council... guess pretty easy control virus outbreak worry petty issues like people's human rights certainly millions dead now. let‚Äôs realistic here...if putting mask hard uncomfortable, people aren‚Äôt exercising switching healthy diet. concerned dying would wearing mask. Same, ended arthritis 18 seems like outdoor things little terms spred.

There articles time ONE home parties, wedding, church meetings bar night yielding tens infected, big outdoor events seem that.

Seems 200 people inside bar worse 20.000 outdoors.

It's weird looks like that. Ahh protests okay. Jammed together thousands screaming yelling getting tear gassed. Subsequently coughing sneezing everyone. Everyone wearing masks (or bandanas) incorrectly.

But nobody allowed go beach. That‚Äôs selfish irresponsible. point, join chorus others declare ""should taken seriously"" hospital bed. Well, that's risk take shut large portion country. 
Also, referring something loss jobs shutdown, delusional. shutdown caused far damage virus will. protesters wore masks outside appears much safer wrt spread. aren‚Äôt really sure we‚Äôll coming back air. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I‚Äôm denying it‚Äôs tragic, blessedly mild pandemic. live Unicoi county, population less 18k. We've grand total 52 cases, recovered. week ago, one wore mask here, except employees required employers.

Today, half customers grocery store wearing masks, ones refused find avoided stared at. fairly sure mask wearers beginning pandemic. dare suggest middle aged white population subjected wearing masks like common thug woman!

Everyone knows wearing mask way getting slowly suffocate rip innocent confederate monuments. 

Even true, old people, inferm, homeless, poor people, anyone spit yelling manager die.

&amp;#x200B;

Youre hero though, working Dennys 2.75 hour get pancakes plague. wonder food.

You can't eat food mask on. I'm protesting I'm probably drinking eating snacks constantly. party am. Wearing face shield + mask better mask itself. Must've 50 cent Corona night  shit. seeing much younger average age per patient.

But still passively watching control. strategy herd immunity youth infection, say so.

Or going try contain using distancing, masks, testing tracing, let‚Äôs say then. 

I don‚Äôt need CDC recap Worldometers data.

And spoiler alert - deaths going 1000 day 2 weeks starts leaking back 50 population. Sure, 60,000 people crammed together like sardines won‚Äôt ever transmit virus. think go less risk as, even without vaccine, advances treatments made. They're already made. things might change long-term living like years years, unless encountered virus killing, like, 20-30% people got it. think big part difference voluntarily helping others forced it. people like told do. NYC drastically different demographic whole population. median age actually 3 years younger median age US death rate slightly lower wild logical comment appears. Florida testing groundwork increased testing established. Hence higher reported cases. 

Hospitalizations deaths per case lower Florida number reasons. airline serious person banned future flights.

Also, can't law enforcement notified, land passenger spend time them, potentially missing connecting flight pickup, even ultimately released. jesus man hurt kid. everything okay man matter bro Get used headline Florida. like I'm surprised. state run morons swear. sack shit could better job. Canada needs fix problems deaths seniors' homes. hope allocating money too. pushing gun bans bullshit draconian laws

A lot did, nobody right gives chance anymore, predecessors ""[tried] push AWB, magazine capacity bans, ban cosmetic features like last time stronger background checks proposed"". Yeah, don‚Äôt know comment getting downvoted, that‚Äôs Reddit ya! Google ""Shaun King"" get feel leading dialogue add ""Jesus"" search get feel look specific situation further. personally know feel situation, want throw biased sources there. good expression outrage, make TIMING good first response shut bars. remember seeing whole bunch people partying streets Daytona Beach bars open weeks ago. also protests gatherings place. would seem likely vectors transmission.  


I think bars likely place virus spread. know local strip clubs open gangbuster business, there's zero social distancing going on.  


The last time businesses shut down, bars restaurants first. think they've worded there's alcohol served indoors, even meals. unless there's outdoor seating, restaurants essentially lost bar income---for limited dine-in capacity. Although went friend shortly things reopened place packed. suspect dine-in next go, since restaurants already experience takeout delivery.  


I work dentistry. There's way keep us open shutting us last time. virus around, busy dental office sure seems like effective way spread it.  Stock market well gauge well everything else going.

üòÇüòÇüòÇ Agree first statement.

Second statement flawed. CDC said death rate .26% entire population infected people. you‚Äôre taking subset total population (NYC) saying death rate doesn‚Äôt match death rate whole population... that‚Äôs statistics works.

Don‚Äôt get upset, saying you‚Äôre wrong saying logic flawed. medical experts? want move Canada badly. hate :( idiot coworker first person saw work department 6/15 months social isolation Livingston county. mask, gets real close me. Thanks that. couple days ago tells daughter friends fucking idiots hang work bar, get tested. says like big fucking deal. 

If sounds like description yourself, FUCK YOU! executive order specific paid benefits legislation passed state level March. ADA require employer offer paid leave. executive order also override paid sick leave CARES Act. 

The executive order forcing employer pay employee, quarantine choice employee made, normally required state benefits. Yeah, special, let get away stuff like that. example, heard one guy claimed people loved much could shoot people middle Fifth Avenue get away it.

Nightmarish visions like plagued Ms. Victory hospitalization spring severe respiratory failure caused coronavirus. made agitated one night, pulled ventilator breathing tube; another time, fell chair landed floor intensive care unit.

‚ÄúIt real, scared,‚Äù said Ms. Victory, 31, back home Franklin, Tenn.

To startling degree, many coronavirus patients reporting similar experiences. Called hospital delirium, phenomenon previously seen mostly subset older patients, already dementia, recent years, hospitals adopted measures reduce it.

‚ÄúAll erased Covid,‚Äù said Dr. E. Wesley Ely, co-director Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction Survivorship Center Vanderbilt University Nashville Veteran‚Äôs Administration Hospital, whose team developed guidelines hospitals minimize delirium.

Now, condition bedeviling coronavirus patients ages previous cognitive impairment. Reports hospitals researchers suggest two-thirds three-quarters coronavirus patients I.C.U.‚Äôs experienced various ways. ‚Äúhyperactive delirium,‚Äù paranoid hallucinations agitation; ‚Äúhypoactive delirium,‚Äù internalized visions confusion cause patients become withdrawn incommunicative; both.

The experiences aren‚Äôt terrifying disorienting. Delirium detrimental consequences long lifts, extending hospital stays, slowing recovery increasing people‚Äôs risk developing depression post-traumatic stress. Previously healthy older patients delirium develop dementia sooner otherwise would die earlier, researchers found.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs increased risk temporary even permanent cognitive deficits,‚Äù said Dr. Lawrence Kaplan, director consultation liaison psychiatry University California, San Francisco Medical Center. ‚ÄúIt actually devastating people realize.‚Äù

The ingredients delirium pervasive pandemic. include long stints ventilators, heavy sedatives poor sleep. factors: patients mostly immobile, occasionally restrained keep accidentally disconnecting tubes, receive minimal social interaction families can‚Äôt visit medical providers wear face-obscuring protective gear spend limited time patients‚Äô rooms.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like perfect storm generate delirium, really, really is,‚Äù said Dr. Sharon Inouye, leading delirium expert founded Hospital Elder Life Program, guidelines helped significantly decrease delirium among older patients. program Dr. Ely‚Äôs devised recommendations reducing delirium pandemic.

The virus body‚Äôs response may also generate neurological effects, ‚Äúflipping people delirium state,‚Äù said Dr. Sajan Patel, assistant professor University California, San Francisco.

The oxygen depletion inflammation many seriously ill coronavirus patients experience affect brain organs besides lungs. Kidney liver failure lead buildup delirium-promoting medications. patients develop small blood clots don‚Äôt cause strokes spur subtle circulation disruption might trigger cognitive problems delirium, Dr. Inouye said.

‚ÄúI paranoiac phase thought sort conspiracy me,‚Äù said.

When first placed ventilator, doctors used lighter sedative, propofol, dialed hours could awake know ‚Äî ‚Äúregimen try avoid delirium,‚Äù said Dr. Daniel Burkhardt, anesthesiologist intensivist treated him.

But Mr. Temko‚Äôs respiratory failure worsened. blood pressure plummeted, condition propofol intensifies. allow ventilator completely breathe him, doctors chemically paralyzed, required heavier sedatives prevent trauma conscious unable move.

So Mr. Temko‚Äôs sedation switched midazolam, benzodiazepine, fentanyl, opioid ‚Äî drugs exacerbate delirium.

After two weeks, sedative-weaning process began, delirium-related quandaries emerged. Mr. Temko began experiencing pain anxiety, compelling doctors balance treating conditions using medications worsen delirium, said.

The repeated nursing visits Mr. Temko needed interrupted sleep-wake cycle, he‚Äôd often take daytime naps become sleepless agitated night, said Jason Bloomer, I.C.U. nurse.

At home, wife kept phone pillow could hear via nurse‚Äôs tablet. ‚ÄúHe would wake confused anxious he‚Äôd start getting worked ventilator couldn‚Äôt work,‚Äù said Mrs. Temko, would reassure him, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, breathe.‚Äù

His hallucinations included rotating human head. ‚ÄúEvery time came around, someone put nail it, could see person still alive,‚Äù said.

He imagined wristwatch (which actually home) stolen man turned catheter. man played recording Ben Bernanke, former Federal Reserve chair, told Mr. Temko recognized name, ‚Äú‚ÄòYou know much, you‚Äôre leaving hospital.‚Äô‚Äù

When Mr. Bloomer asked ‚ÄúDo feel safe?,‚Äù Mr. Temko shook head mouthed around breathing tube: ‚Äú‚ÄòHelp me.‚Äô‚Äù

Later, became despairing. ‚ÄúI know wanted live die,‚Äù said.

He met Dr. Kaplan, psychiatrist, recognized symptoms delirium, partly Mr. Temko bungled tests like naming months backward counting 100 sevens. ‚ÄúHe could get 100 93,‚Äù Dr. Kaplan said, adding, ‚ÄúThe cardinal sin delirium always impaired attention.‚Äù

Dr. Kaplan prescribed Seroquel, said helps perceptual disturbances anxiety.

Mr. Temko said another turning point came Mr. Bloomer said months hard work, recovery likely.

An optimistic cognitive sign, said Dr. Kaplan, Mr. Temko describe delirium much detail could several weeks ago.

Some coronavirus patients develop delirium even relatively short I.C.U. stints.

Anatolio Jos√© Rios, 57, intubated four days Massachusetts General Hospital didn‚Äôt receive highly delirium-inducing sedatives. Still, sedation lifted, heard booms, saw flashes light people praying him.

‚ÄúOh God, scary,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd opened eyes, saw doctors, nurses praying dream.‚Äù realize hetero people get HIV too, right? test blood goes hospitals clinics. please tell monogamous gay couple could possible get infected people they're sleeping other?

A blanket ban entire group people wrong. purpose screen sexualy promiscuous people, ban hetero people fit criteria. use bankruptcy now? So, examine trial data? seems short sighted. Citizenship? know mate, hand om silver platter. Another example people ignore facts like Yes, good you. It‚Äôs truly one two facts know work. Distance masks. plenty time hang out, gets control. alone, iso since March. people dying 70. Young people put whole lives hold people lived life already. course young victims...sadly always is. Older people get sicker nearly illnesses that's way is. hope find therapy's help...but whole generations young people going lock years. still scary data shows young people fine. long term argument...we also know long term side effects rushed vaccine. Probably need collect dozen more, even hundreds, get point across young people that, even run good chance surviving it, still run dangerous risk getting kicked ass thing. 100 degrees almost 100% humidity. Believe want please stay home

Feels lethal outside live recruit medical students things bad. Charlotte? What's funny live red parts state complying bit better Long island sprinkled arent part ha e elderly dont want risk already existing methods simpler effective. What‚Äôs people? can‚Äôt socially distance keeping society partly open? works parts world. goes far beyond mere racism. Pretty much every country migrant labor major disease vector, there's little initiative current economic system deal humane way. xenophobic responses even helping spread virus forces already mobile population mobile. reminds north caucasus turned shitshow (now-unemployed) migrant youth went back rural villages contracting covid Moscow Rostov. also echoes sentiments forum months ago places like California looking direct assistance homeless undocumented people.

People humanity even self-interest. Live Honduras, law mask. fine, jail time, and/or community service. Funny say people helping.

My first year house didn‚Äôt snowblower got absolutely dumped one night. next day shoveling driveway gonna take hours.

A passing plow truck beeped me, waved aside plowed it. Driver never even rolled window thanks. backed drove way.

Dude saved 3 hours hard work day. Sooo, ""young people's"" fault huh? Sundays especially, there‚Äôs always dip cases. fact it‚Äôs still 8.5k very, bad sign. 

Monday‚Äôs numbers usually light well since reflect Sunday‚Äôs testing. I‚Äôm willing bet it‚Äôll 5 figures Tuesday don‚Äôt get Abbott. He‚Äôs re-election he? Like hate desantis Ducey least political reasons they‚Äôre doing?

Does Abbott wanna run President something? police budget?!!!!! That's one way get numbers suppose. Welcome back European Union! death counts continue drop US. narrative total disaster false. Something gives feeling many universities opening physically US academic year starts again... Protests happened time. There's reason Chicago WA would surge month behind.

Also call surge yet. WA maybe 700-800 new cases compared states pushing well thousands. Wow red cross northeast Florida, well no.blood Washington help workers places much, people later exposed covid continued spread. Lol provide evidence. Listen carefully..

FuuuuuCK them. really think would moron think mass protests didn‚Äôt contribute spread Covid. way re-openings people observing social distancing also contributing spread. Look numbers California. fucking shit. tell watches fox news based actions/how talk virus. Random internet stranger's plea : "" stop going info/news personalities entire worldview ."" Keep what? They're ignoring safety practices restaurants bars letting everyone whatever want. Long term side effects concern here. Efficacy concern. like every state. power numbers, cant fire teachers. Unfortunately teachers Texas passive reason. still cant Apparently 7% frequent Circle K near house. ppl like cult. can't slightest dissenting opinion course do. ""Anonymous insider Downing street"" spin talk ""nothing"". they'll run story filled maybe might. 


Like I've said, there's single article referencing mixed messages month. Whatever crap press decide run official advice coming government, write readers want hear. guarantee there's mixed messages coming tomorrow. makes sense then! think go hike, would bring mask case ended somehow close strangers, least area, probably need it. Thanks posting - great article anyone actually read article. says kids families posative test kids. GDI. want know worst case scenario looks like. society look like. Sanitation great rich parts lol hope one day we'll able see COVID Trump turning point wake-up call better. clearly need large changes within system, system led partisanship would impossible pass amendments needed. companies manufacturing vaccines masses testing time? That's fine. us want live, reject it, we'll get sooner. hospitals didn‚Äôt want get rid paying customers. required herd immunity percent?

I seen estimates 20-80%. stage current knowledge virus, that's moment *estimates*.

Also, herd immunity switch gets 66% whatever virus gives stops infecting people. level immunity community slow somewhat.  One would think social distancing would possible courtroom Exactly. I'd love nothing give blood telling I'd lie sleeping husband I've 13 years actually sex 3 months?

What pisses makes least sense cannot HIV reasons. test BLOOD anyways. Testing gay blood cost money. anything found HIV could least inform people know yet, potentially saving lives keeping people safe. 

But instead they're stuck backwards ass time. LIBERATE Yet people surprise us time unfortunately. Personally, I'd shocked everyone chose wear mask sake humanity...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è one hating NYTimes's overly pessimistic worst case-scenario reporting?

Feel free consume ü¶ä News want ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù news stories second coming Turbo Economy American Greatness think people old enough users remember /u/unidan Fauci admitted lied masks incredibly obvious lie anyone took 30 seconds really think 

 day reading news 2 top headlines something like.

""Doctors dying mask shortages""

And

""Masks help protect public virus""

That's one example. bringing back astronaut diapers? Completely agree. Vitamin super important staying healthy virus research UV effectively stopping virus becoming transmitable (although that‚Äôs fully confirmed/researched yet) microbes sand water.

We expect much government leaders levels, also step part social contract register choices voting. think couldn‚Äôt wrong. even broken clock right twice day. lived body that‚Äôs affected chronic ailments chronic pain last decade life, assure still don‚Äôt want die shit! Yea, it‚Äôs sucks. yea, it‚Äôs living healthy body. could trade body new one, would heartbeat. wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ‚Äúalmost worse dying‚Äù...and I‚Äôd like think husband 20 years kids mother around love raise last 10 years would agree well!

Your comment really insulting millions us *already living private prisons call bodies*. crabs. Also, Vancouver public health advises patrons skip shrimp cocktail breakfast buffet A+ many % lasting issues? think around 10%. answer CV STD not, I‚Äôll think lifetime gaslighting. begs question giving remdesivir patients get-go might beneficial offering severe cases only?

Supply cost. 

Rutgers' Carrier said expects Gilead set remdesivir price somewhere $10 $4,500 ICER estimated. company charged $1,000 per pill Sovaldi, cure hepatitis C. HIV drug Truvada cost $22,000 per year. 

The company‚Äôs bolstering supply aim treat 1 million patients end year. 

As April 2020, enough remdesivir 140,000 treatment courses expect 500,000 courses October 2020 

Also, worth noting super new drug barely approved use anything. Right looks like side effects profile bad, giving drugs everyone regardless specific risks generally common approach. yeah that's pretty accurate Same, donated month half ago. Obviously risk involved felt least could staying home months. could see donating time everyone that‚Äôs ok. Two things true  satisfied, especially considering present administration's cavalier attitude toward anything approaching reality. relieved I'm forced economic necessity get mix face-mask deniers. And, since I'm south Louisiana, they're much majority around here. Bullshit, got nothing human rights. people know behave nasty shitty disease running rampant. Shame lot don't. close family member almost die colon infection caused many covid shits. 

The epithelial cells colon intestines constantly open let covid-infected diarrhea flow body, dozens times day lets bacteria pathogens infect GI tract easily, I‚Äôd imagine. ...how would feel cost you, parents, siblings, friends? isnt cut dry. People machines. Thought end March.
Right I'm 3 different puffers month long course steroids 

The chest pain still bad enough bring tears eyes.

Fuck people unwillingness take shit seriously. spend lot time Thailand every year, lot Thai friends (who live overseas.) really access websites really need access truth, unless last 3 months they've dropped ball? regularly research Thailand in-country Europe. 
I worry friends there, Thai people general. shame education system, government/junta controls stone wall Thainess, actually never change. next riot/coup probably year away. 'normal' country?! You‚Äôre downvoted didn‚Äôt source all. provide source No, really don't. joke gods gave CFS (and disabilities) take world (not literally, figuratively). 

I huge go getter CFS like death sentence. days almost depressing stay alive can't make meat suit match brain energy. Thankfully team doctors found combo drugs make functional rarely depressed like beginning. wrong drastically changing question. Yes, track use evidence encourage people lower risk. We've collectively done horrible job making people aware risks COVID-19. widespread misunderstanding mild case looks like example that.

But article helping people sick. Let's jump victim blaming implying careless. Plenty people taking reasonable precautions still catching this.

Since used AIDS example akin saying we're going help pushing safer sex campaign. That's great avoid future victims takes focus treating hurting today. reason many people ADD, ADHD high functioning autism significantly higher chance growing clinical depression. 

They know something wrong can't understand finally gathered courage confide loved ones it, met dismissals.

Species- Coronavirus Exactly. started thought ER going flooded. Instead, numbers went *down* people issues weren‚Äôt coming ER. Less accidents, people *were* ill less eager seek treatment hospital fear virus. 

In area, trend over. ER hopping right now. Neat, thanks! likely get car accident way restaurant. PA, 4-5% positive weeks now, hope stay there, may seeing small rise, % positive still &lt;5%. Yup part game. Sometimes hit Homer sometimes strike out. zero evidence man made...  Ah, yes, travel ban. We're familiar those. world respect us yet? Asking friend. Yes, assuming class size 200+ Brazil list. Yup, removed icu capacity projections, changed icu capacity alert level red yellow despite numbers getting much worse increasing rate. pretty much guarantee hospital management telling data guys tone make look bad. Descrimination!! need bash US Americans, brothers ok, get act together vote right man next time. impossible ""now"", possible Feb even March. US whole lack determination fight seriously.

The central/federal gov enjoys calling ""just flu"" gives coordination plans, even make states competing supplies. Individual state govs incapable pushing programs, telling people danger virus.

The less say people, better.

Hell, I'd even say US, whole, never seriously fought it. Individual states? Sure, NY well (compared US), whole country? terrible show there. Probably like trump Tulsa rally. outskirts empty, people cluster together one spot. Actually quarantine authority asked churches practicing rather tough measures secondary infections worship services churches normal~big scale months ( although covid-19 patients turned attended services. )

Since May, clusters concentrated small-sized churches bible study groups formed members churches. 

This time, group activity ( outing choir practice ) within big church caused outbreak. health authority fortold introduce new measures targetting activities. Probably reason hate wearing one, sucks sucks even summer. always wear one public put 20 feet entrance soon step outside goes flying off. 

Then people like mom boss, they'll wear told sends anxiety roof need break every calm down. case boss needs bring 2nd shirt switch lunch he'll sweat lot anxious. defund police movement movement abolish police. movement take away massive cash influx goes police things need, like military grade weapons tanks, move money social workers social services would improve community. social workers go along police would definitely goal defund police. like city budgets, majority entire budget goes police dept, many essential services sidelined. making sure everyone gets fair share budget properly job, getting rid police. Here, mask :P Tell plane yesterday good 25% wearing.

I took plane 1 month ago. one ones wearing mask. Droplets fall ground faster humid air, fuse together faster (more droplets means chance collision), makes heavy enough fall quicker dry air. yes, humid air better comes airborne part, downside also results surfaces getting contaminated faster (although fomite transmission appears rare SARS-CoV-2). Important keep mind effect necessarily mean lower transmission substantially risk factors still issue (numerous hot humid cities suffered terrifying outbreaks, like Manaus Guayaquil). 
 
Meat processing plants hotspots dry, cool air (which allows virus stay alive linger longer), loud machinery (which means people need shout make heard), people working close vicinity other. air refreshed recycled (which case Germany's largest meat plant outbreak), adds huge new security risk - point air may become contaminated even heavy-duty mask may still serious risk filling many hours-long shift. Boston suburbs I‚Äôm happy say people wearing masks public, families see restaurants wearing masks soon sit down, disappointing.

Also people wear masks never bother cover nose, remove talking. would technically part 80% poll, masks aren‚Äôt preventing anything. specifically said terms testing mortality rates. mention anything containment. going happen. States broke president senate think pandemic ban ppl decided allow full capacity airplanes. tools fight yes, necessary evils way people could choose, applied.

Again needed - disagree that. use simile evacuating protecting production facilities, like abandoning them. saving population, go back facilities ruined, long gone.

And again, that's way must be. Human lives matter facilities. think people underestimate long-term effects it, disagree idea calling victory.

The victory would victory know we'd - i.e. virus allowed start spreading begin with. freak accident did, matter believe started wet market something conspiratorial, could absolutely avoided. would true victory. I've got nothing weed users weed legalization, ... basically confirming boomer parents used say, smoking weed makes dumber? Genuine question, troling anything. eyes say people lied. Last heard, Bill Gates billionaire Humidity help packed bars trying keep humidity out. great white calling cops black patrons. moment risk getting place burn down. Ireland part Schengen zone? bet put negatives. I've got credit cards... maybe buy shitload gold credit cards hide woods years... Yes I'm long distance relationship truly sucks. also come heavily hit state fucking pissed Americans can't follow basic rules social distancing wearing masks. always knew Americans care freedom others selfishness displayed last months upsetting. can't imagine tired healthcare professionals are. Outraged American Karen demands speak EU's supervisor! (COUGH) (COUGH) school delivering food houses need them. I‚Äôm optimistic well, think get treatment soon, whole world working ‚Äútogether‚Äù might‚Äôve gotten one sooner everybody tried downplaying saying ‚ÄúIt‚ÄôS FlU‚Äù cool, Trump still reopened U.S. either, despite everyone telling whole thing Faux News Flu.

I know letting whole travel tourism industry suffer. think much workers hotels would love job laid off. International visitors could quarantine fabulous resorts. Washington DC hotel need beg taxpayers break lease. Countries can't deny entry citizens. might quarantine arriving. vaccines work using dead weakened versions virus create antibodies fight virus.

No, least virus. Many vaccines using chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine. 

Please educate start spouting utter nonsense like this. What's current active cases? 9 deaths? Idk that‚Äôs OD low Hmmmm, wearing mask drive through. think that. little silly, since way .00001% chance dying whenever get car, cross street, eat something could choke on, use stove... list goes on. Living general comes risks. I‚Äôm saying go risk COVID, let‚Äôs pretend living risk-free possible. I'm fan, right. nationwide mask mandate would help ton. 'teeth' behind said mandate. Sure. That‚Äôs AZ kept re-electing Sheriff Joe! Lol. couldn‚Äôt pay enough move family back there. aren‚Äôt rising degree new cases that‚Äôs including lag deaths conjunction hospitalization rates. think germany reacted best.

Not even close. want see proper, informed response looks like, see Taiwan Vietnam. Pretty much everybody else racked large numbers preventable deaths proper funding, could easily create COVID-specific infusion centers.

It's strange quickly people throw idea latched onto unimportant part; compared dialysis. 

Just use types places model. whole idea bad, can't *literally* place dialysis (and even know true). Worst case scenario virus mutates dead turn zombies. Bravo lovely womanüéâüíú incredibly American think entire planet creating coronavirus hoax don‚Äôt like president. It‚Äôs weird. virus everywhere. Well, everywhere island near India natives kill anyone shows bodies never get found. still. entire planet created hoax get back America? find far fetched. schools wouldn‚Äôt buying supplied state federal stockpiles Europeans abroad still allowed EU citizens, might 14 day quarantine. lump ""all"", ""most"" ""some"" one category? teachers well educated enough know wearing masks important. me, can't come soon enough. saw one halfwit talking friend, wearing masks, pulled nose talk louder friend went separate stairwell. yeah thanks tip, kid I‚Äôll first say actually surprised amount people actually complying county‚Äôs (Maricopa) mask policy. gives slightest hope next two hellish weeks, might start see progress.

Ducey strangely silent past couple days, besides twitter posts ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safer stay home‚Äù. wonder he‚Äôs going toe line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm encouraging people responsible‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre screwed anyway‚Äù. won‚Äôt find now, CCP‚Äôs Internet army deep cleaned. Liberal media reporting protests actually helping bring covid19 numbers down. Good luck convincing people already packing bars stay home. renew embassy people right believe:

1. world flat
2. moon landing faked
3. vaccines cause autism
4. 5G causes corona
5. masks kill people

There's likely Venn diagram show crossover, it'll look like Russian nesting doll. Lots people hate do, hate peers work toxic environments. Truly pathetic miserable way live lives.

No wonder third world taking jobs. take pride working American European companies. Can't exceptions like bars restaurants work. Kicking people calling cops really bright thing moment. Ah yes, could go wrong yet another alternative medicine solid evidence support choosing continue paying wages closure keeping petri dishes closed choice? risk lives gratuities prematurely government allowed it? still need control ppl. 

Ppl aren‚Äôt bright much self restrain also seen measles virus COVID world breaker. attacks 2 planes. Spiritual Physical. planes taking pounding right now. helps body person affirms every day prayer, meditation, positive thoughts actions. virus mutate, again, even infectious form. Thankfully technology defeat it. I'm certain sooner later. What‚Äôs argument? say downvote? arguments ""bars, one dangerous spreaders"" like shit, Bars meant social distancing. ppl understand that? vaccines work using dead weakened versions virus create antibodies fight virus. people getting antibodies permanently defeat Covid, get vaccine. friend Europe posted weeks ago social media stating numbers US weren‚Äôt bad we‚Äôre huge country. Obviously argued stating untrue, compared numbers per capita country much less. wonder thinks wouldn‚Äôt even allowed country state making international news numbers? Snake oil *cries South Carolina* got pneumonia younger, took probably 6mo fully recover, may permanent you, may take bit longer 6mo damage severe. Yes, brother law works American company ( Canada) he's California twice pandemic. comes back Canada quarantine government checks daily.

He said gets California nobody gives shit. article linked indicates ""Freedom Breathe Agency"" already shut FB group Wix website. maybe trend stop really revs Reminds February way people acting Makes cry. nurse arranged room could together...what amazing person! We're talking reopening borders Schengen area already working banning travelers China ban here. Yes. list ones stop right worst case scenario crisis, made worse vacuum political leadership, threatening overwhelm hospitals spread control. Canadian border closed July non essential travel.  never said respons wasnt good.
Eventough think germany reacted best.

And downplaying, tried hide thing propaganda rolling want show world chinese gov save us all.

Im glad gov sent tyvek back january china Im also glad refused help march wanted organise propaganda show. thanks. Absolutely agree there. constant sinus issues, colds, bronchitis etc years. Would always gamble woke feeling like crap every morning. 
Started taking Vitamin levels low made difference. Crazy one small deficiency plays huge rule proper immune functioning. biggest difference ACTUALLY shut here. didn‚Äôt go except pick grocery order 6 weeks- every 2 week trip. probably mid April started ordering food delivery again. still ridden bus gone anywhere except grocery store pharmacy- wasn‚Äôt end May actually felt comfortable enough go inside store. like 10-20 cases day still I‚Äôm still go inside mall restaurant eat, though opened dine like 2 weeks ago. mean guys took like 3 weeks- blew it. It‚Äôs enough time. I‚Äôm American living Vancouver feel fucking fortunate country shit together thing. glad family back home takes seriously. defund police. guys fucking idiot yea, much true... totally fair, hoards fucking morons thought would good idea go retarded, much blame. Even then, indoors without mask bad idea.

Go outdoors can. proud job Minneapolis doing. Ever since March norm everyone public wearing mask. it‚Äôs mandated while. look like fucking psycho aren‚Äôt wearing one. However travel hour town it‚Äôs exact opposite. Sigh. relatively easy tweak known virus add genes viruses create kinda Frankenstein virus might want, virus different enough creating lab would incredibly unlikely. like instead taking parts another car fix car, build half car scratch without knowing completely car works everything right. Yeah, I'm one trust vaccine right away. I'm one ""dumbos"" I'm anti-vaxx whatever else, I'm sure vaccine gonna fresh new, especially isolate hard chance infected anyways (Quarantined well know) means least 7% US population stupid... opportunistic Pelosi. She‚Äôs moron. Individual states handing mandates wear masks dumb ass said something. needs shut up. US pretty self-sufficient economical trade continue, even Corona quarantine rules. think US sould concerned hospitals major cities running full right now. Fuck.... Everyone wear mask. China smarten next time new diseases. Governments countries, put us flow risk...it always high risk! Kind point ok Living ventilator far inconvenient fogged glasses. Anyone know applies American students/workers? got offered job Europe friend mine got accepted grad school there... Makes sense. ""But heat kills virus"". degradation international debasement America continues Oh, totally right. way many decades. really biting ass moment. Yeah course mileage may vary area area.

Where am, mask compliance entering business REQUIRES upwards 99%. line work dealing store vendors. I‚Äôve talked get customer two week starts argument - that‚Äôs amongst hundreds weekly customers.

On hand, I‚Äôve places really lax it, even telling customers worry it. case, many customers don‚Äôt wear it. I‚Äôve seen behavior personal time outdoor dining we‚Äôve done ‚Äî places direct policy verbally tell patrons seating get widespread compliance, places shitty little piece paper wall don‚Äôt say loud don‚Äôt. (I think we‚Äôre done outdoor dining way. many stupid, selfish people there.) ‚Äúlife-long effects‚Äù stuff completely ridiculous considering virus maybe 7 months old. Like? getting data? wouldn‚Äôt put much stock anecdotes. person likes travel, fuck. love people don‚Äôt slightest bit research. literally hasn‚Äôt changed entire time yet still continually see question asked. Luckily me, masks mandatory work. company also provides masks, gloves, disinfectant. get temperature checked entering facility. claim sent home caught without wearing seen happen yet. think virus control then? don't. Gilead developing inhaled version used proxy CV?

This unintelligible. Please re-phrase way normal person understand it. try arguing natural immunity possible vaccine going lead immunity.

Can show anyone arguing this?  clear already heard argument still disagree it.

I see value wasting time.

Some people bad ideas matter convincing are. Like people refuse wear masks. feel like nose thing quite bad... know studies, calmly breathing nose cannot possibly expel many droplets talking know amount coronavirus exposure impacts severe symptoms are. i'd prefer people cover mouth nose, would rather people leave nose wear mask, i'm seeing even often.

there also people medical conditions restrict breathing, make hard wear mask top (that's places mask requirements usually medical exemptions). feel like covering mouth would improvement that's people do. obviously people noses conditions like this, important remember medical conditions like always obvious observer. sure who's downvoting you. Americans inspired Hitler ridiculous Eugenics bullshit. nearly wrong side ww2. nazis ww3 what's going indicator. That's trump lying masks scary me. 

If get reject simple truth, they'll believe lie tell. quite overused wrong context right. like Karen became boomer was. Karen really (apologies term) entitled c*** wants speak manager. used instead woman camera. see ignoring science well. 20 years highly u likely severely sick people risk never leave house vaccine. It‚Äôs hard protect  100 degrees outside live gave blood would pretty much guarantee would pass out. True. might weird thing say I‚Äôm kinda relieved find someone optimistic treatments sub. got attacked earlier talking vaccine candidates. How's policy affect people dual U.S./E.U. citizenship currently U.S.? theme parks reopen. Good hear! seems like rollout take long enough you‚Äôll get let others try first either way Yes truth, Ive completely forgot them. (which compliment, news them)

Both countries common dont trust chinese gov.

In western world still think germany reacted best. Florida hit peak yet, that's people saying things. *desperate*? No. seem desperate want turn political issue. terms pooled versus individual testing, merely implementation detail.  mass *testing* without mass *tests*. Nah Muricans welcome Sweden. Broke back car accident decades ago.  qualify plate, especially since days barely stand.  also know I'm much need others, thus refuse get one (maybe I'm elderly, currently 50).  bother SoCal every handicap spot almost always taken. wish police would check make sure expired, fake, person assigned car. guess started cracking down, would ton violations. again, lot doctors blindly issue. wonder includes forces NATO realize can‚Äôt randomly hire people teachers right? least states need 4 year degree certified. fairly substantial background check, husband double masters still go back school take additional 45 units pass series specialized tests get teaching certification. Testing positive means infect others sick yet, that, know, want happen want contain outbreak. Stuff elementary fucking fungus gnat knows that. wonder there's time frame policy? mask. Freedom speech. Damn, there's quite things could've possibly done instead right now. would he? strip technically part LV anyone want visit USA rate? put surge capacity equation red yellow? reopen nightclubs all? People never going responsible, even countries follow rules. grandpa fly back Europe cant fly alone anymore old 22 days ago...  Try wearing mask working public 13 hours day. ‚Äúthe rona‚Äù local business terminated many jobs, essential folks like left long hour shifts trying protect dumb citizens.

Wear mask say? Try one day, 13 hours. public. vice.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please try arguing natural immunity possible vaccine going lead immunity. Well alright. love much fellow Citizen. Keep cute. garbage headline. DIDN‚ÄôT follow safety guidelines one wearing masks social distancing. Idiotic comment. Everyone knows virus came China. closing question exactly question need asking across board. new reality we're living in, we're forced adjust. strategizing new models best practices sharing ideas/methods large. Lack leadership effective communication really hurting us. passed right legislation. assumes people agree data accurate COVID analyzed scientifically. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve learned can‚Äôt conversation family members fundamentally believe underlying data manipulated (undercounted, overcounted, collected improperly, more) fit agenda. collection, believe statistical analysis done incorrectly.

If can‚Äôt use data common starting point, can‚Äôt possibly discuss situation reach conclusion. absolutely idea - keep family home mask rarely go essentials. Yes labs people majoring music, things hard virtually. know girl switched online university labs. Apparently, mail kits lab work.  Meanwhile Brazil four-digit daily deaths American, DA MASKS INFRINGING MAH FREEDOMS, WONT WEAR THEM!

/s  doesn‚Äôt spread outside. Ask experts said protests. Sure do. deny entrance don‚Äôt stand 6 feet apart. tested 5 million people,

Well, know cling opinions without reading. 

The article linked (and plethora multiple reporting agencies around globe) city official announced Tuesday city completed 9.9 million tests May 14 June 1. tested previously included, virtually everyone age five city 11 million people tested, said Li Lanjuan, member National Health Commission expert team. 

Obviously, average, tested 1/19'th population every day. 1/200 population, stated. want fucking mask mandate. want Congress fucking job. Unless planning trip back Europe American friends, really affect THOUSANDS HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE knew magical filtration, doctors nursing staff wear masks! take prayer hospitals, would fine now. /s Whyyyyy what's logic? Yeah guy rails. almost like constantly redirecting conversation..  Weird..... makes feel better, believe actions individual citizens far important actions governments environment. .00001% chance worth it? greater chance dying car accident, getting shot killed, falling dying, stuck killed car, choking food, sun stroke, getting electrocuted, dying bee sting. flu even way deadlier that. really pointless afraid odds. sure. largely intellectual exercise. matter AZ NY 1/4 NY. bad. Lol think going France Thanksgiving, sorry. thats hospitals overwhelmed Thank God. Otherwise plenty ignorant US travelers looking take vacation despite risks everyone bring virus back across pond. people refusing wear mask secondary issue.  idiots STILL believe COVID fake/hoax/conspiracy/etc. wear mask, violation freedom protecting anyone anything.  protect COVID, well, flu can't wear mask flu. wonder someone knows metal poisoning identify that. Maybe exposed toxic chemicals fumes virus. sounds horrific, can't believe try trace whatever was. I'm sure understand mean.

I interpret many ways.  Why?

And how? Canada border's closed general traffic keeps getting extended. is. novel virus mortality rate under.1% asymptomic extremely minor vast majority contract it. else would call it? /r/im14andthisisdeep country? 

Go India still get strong class system, restaurants servers, in-house help. 

Sure coincidence?  Probably due boarder closed. state? general area? dont mind always seemed like mid late 2000's TNA thought real competition fell towards 2010's. think even tried compete Monday Night Raw failed miserably. guess somebody owes lockdown protesters apology?

Exactly point - media &amp; certain political activists want SHUT vast swaths retail businesses, church gatherings, and, course, political rallies. Extremely cases traced gatherings - exceedingly serious cases &amp; deaths. Almost half deaths due directly WILLFUL decisions put known infected &amp; contagious spreaders &amp; superspreaders closed &amp; sealed nursinghomes. comment removed using word ""c n e r v v e s"" entirely neutral way, God I'm sick subs modding

But trying say, agree you, I'm real confused certain marketers grabbed opportunity sales already. expected see certain inflammatory political positions masks back March, I've seen 0 far. I'm pretty confused it. read article? aren‚Äôt refusing work. want people take 100% online option 2 day school option worked out.
No say wouldn‚Äôt work. school district set options. 99%? Well, uh, good luck, guess. I‚Äôm probably going venturing then, considering could years away, you. coworker went North Carolina last week said exact thing. Someone even went said yeah keep germs one wearing mask I'm looking Universal Health Care road trip US citizens getting summer testing station. Jesus... Somehow 90% people see 7%... Wuhan less 1/100 china's population. Yeah, tech exist. determine patient zeros diseases time. that's usually contact tracing full fledged pandemic even announced. Makes sense. want publicly state hospital missing equipment - could used future disputes bills. Right. Business interests public right now, contrary war. AiRbOrNe AiDs !@! bar enforce rules bar follow them. I‚Äôve found time day matters. Interesting yeah never knew why. remember things really really dire seemed like everyone right thing. 

I‚Äôm glad things getting better, news heart breaking. shifts liability get you. I'm pro vaccine well. think I'm lining try half baked, full steam ahead vaccine cooked government sadly mistaken. already see Trump saying...... ""try it, got lose"". Sorry thanks. Side point: every public school US switch 4-day week planning reopen. I‚Äôm sorry hear that... hope goes away time. :( feel like areas/states trouble shutdown locally. Isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs happening Texas? Technically UK temporary coronavirus prevention measures, well weird things like going round neighnours house quickie. remember going ""look that, absurd!"" videos drones flying around telling people wear masks surfaced. know what, right. still little creepy, necessary. Yes, national shortage teachers totally allow schools fire rehire teachers willy nilly. Also, tenure longer exists guess. taking funds originally intended police use, spend salaries organisation thousands upon thousands social workers? Please tempt 2020 like that. would claustrophobia autism put greater risk coronavirus? I've read article concluded Wuhan quarantining right decision time given known.

The information hand these: 
 
1) SARS-like pneumonia-like illness
2) spread person person highly contagious 
3) substantial proportion patients severe symptoms requiring dedicated medical attention

(2) + (3) meant without measure control spread, virus would quickly collapse health system region even country. especially scary less one week Chinese New Year (a US equivalent would combining Christmas Thanksgiving making last week).

And turned mild COVID patients among contagious, virtually nothing else could done substantially stem spread, finding hundreds couple thousands people mild symptoms peak flu season metropolis 14 million would probably required proper sorcery kind. Sure do. Commerce Clause justify anything days. Ebola mortality rate 50%. Covid 19 0.4 - 1.2%. Yeah no. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* *As polarized*?

He's talking players staff teams alternative LOL. continue taking advantage system others. issues anyone getting unemployment right now. Hell, wish got didn‚Äôt exposed job don‚Äôt get option. 

My complaint strictly fairness yeah yeah know life isn‚Äôt fair that. complain. I'm curious solely due jobs income, feel risk worth it. concern fast flu spreads, even colds, school environment. feel like disaster making. I'm hoping gets control, faith right now. No. worst case scenario happens hospitals overwhelmed.

But didn't? 7% must live community üôÑ Huh, somehow missed Trumps election promise ban travel brown people, link? Yeah seems pretty close CRISPR works. 

And hey im person going make mandatory. even person says wrong get it. 

Im saying institution developing outside american federal government, OPs anti gov concerns dont hold weight Nope. pity us. distance.  people want go catch disease, causes economic collapse. 

it's denying human behavior say ""well, people fine catching virus."" might well saying airlines would fine people sprouted wings helped move plane air save fuel costs. know, everything uncertain right now. Whoa whoa, asking wayyy much Drove parents place SC take care something summer home dad battles cancer.

Local, popular restaurant closed day staff tested positive. reopened packed day later. window open wall house window. think sinking submarine Please check math: town, estimated 10% population coronavirus (asymptomatic spreaders). 

So go risky interaction random stranger (e.g. shared elevator) 10% risk person coronavirus.

Assume 1% chance viral transmission risky encounter. Assume 1 risky encounter per day.

So day 0.1% chance getting coronavirus 99.9% chance I'll fine.

If every day 3 months (90 days) 1 risky encounter day, I'll a:

0.999^90 *100% = ~91% chance getting virus 3 months 9% chance getting virus.

If I'm high risk group 50% chance something bad happening 4.5% chance something bad happening within 3 months.

Over next 365 days, works 30% chance getting coronavirus 15% something bad I'm high risk.

 I'm low risk (1% chance something bad) 0.3% chance next year something bad happens.

So I'm vulnerable group isolate stay home.

If I'm low risk, ""ok"" try avoid people know high risk group assuming isolation compliance vulnerable group.

Finally, ""1% risk viral transmission per risky encounter"" guess assuming parties wearing cloth masks elevator. assume go improper mask usage/lack social distancing healthcare workers wearing proper procedural masks. zilch wearing properly fitted N-95 mask.

Percent Risk (R) days n encounters per day:
Let P prevalence virus community

What? even think CDC power require masks. get. I'm sure least us even qualify essential workers way hell priority get vaccine, whole 'I get vaccine right away rushed' thing stupid. vaccine come October population probably getting near end year/start next year. saying virus slowly mutating. Well, let's see that's gonna work out. live Florida panhandle one takes seriously here. wear mask go (which super rare) infuriating one grocery store wearing one. Traffic normal/heavy. amount people believe ""plandemic"" liberal plot undermine Trump shocking. Yup. used one people saw someone walking around mask pandemic thought weird. everyone wears mask, even notice masks anymore. see people without masks I'm like oh fuck? watch news? looong way trailer park Europe scooter accessible. Yep. weeks. talking anti-vaxxer moms? religious extremists? That's big check. fell asleep car block drive through? anyone know allows transit EU airports Americans? always look away never even see needle. Easy solution. :) opening Wednesday? Yeah agree. Impossible protests lead 0 new cases. also vital understand activities less risky continue reopen resume normal life safer way.

Just saying hunker home never leave 6-18 months silly. one listen, especially areas open others.

Much better say outdoors risk far less. go out, take precautions general safe. Indoors worry. Open windows, wear masks indoors, significantly reduce capacity offices/malls/restaurants etc.

Its politics IMO. data shown protests lead lot virus spread, I'd first say means happening anymore. happen seem main reason new outbreaks. Otherwise big cities east coast would new outbreaks too. I'm discouraged comments saying practical do. many ways accomplish good treatment. No. It‚Äôs airborne HIVola. fair anyone definitively traced infections back restaurant? I've seen bars, family gatherings restaurants lowered capacity spaced patrons. Don‚Äôt ask sub anything. Nobody critical thinking skills understanding virus. Yup.

Think summer particular. Let's say UV light kills virus fast (which one potential explanations proposed transmission outside seems less dangerous inside).

If helps virus spread less, good. let pandemic spread without trying shut many measures possible, new COVID-positive person roll dice every time gather park, protest, etc.... 

Maybe person whose infection new random mutation beats sunlight.

We know could happen, but, *absolutely*, herd-immunity plan rolling dice dozens others millions times to. Yep keep posting garbage, keep deleted.

You literally helping people die spreading shit. doctors probably ‚Äúsuicided‚Äù mysteriously we‚Äôre back square 1 major corporations take trillions relief funds. Sharing glassware.... gross way countries proved works dangerous proving work right now?

Seriously, actual shutdown way get things control. never mentioned mortality rate, looking genetic makeup. didn‚Äôt think thread mortality rate, understood it‚Äôs similarity hiv. Covid-19 immune system similar. Let‚Äôs see 12 months 10 years long term is. read statistics seem ridiculous, plainly 80% people wearing masks.

Some numbers people want wear mask, sometimes wear mask, successfully pressured society wear mask. people answer wear mask even though lot time end not. WANT to, people around dicks certainly would. don't, psychology peer pressure (the wrong direction).

However, bigger reason seems correlation people mask compliant people go much. would answer ""all time"" wearing mask, rarely find place need wear one. Besides work, wear mask time personal desk, go twice week (otherwise working home), inside exactly ONE business (a doctor's office) since 2nd week March. wore mask entire time, 100% compliant, contribute see Lowe's Target Kroger Office Depot whatever... I'm going places. contribute perception wearing mask.

(And yes, know lucky career situation basically hide pretty successfully grand majority time. applies everybody... anybody ultra cautious going extent possible situation, contributing see stores whatever, extent possible given personal situation. )

Anyway, that's 80% comes from. likely close, people wise. representative actual population stores public spaces malls whatever, disproportionate amount people wear masks all/most time go places unless absolutely to. world isn‚Äôt even laughing us anymore. genuinely terrified us. It‚Äôs beyond embarrassing point. Totally done! year virus burn vanish Earth like SARS. ""there's nothing back up.""

Except everything know spreads. agree. place criticizes dear leader reliable source.

What commission likely 'recommend' coordinated border approach member states themselves. Border issues responsibiities member states. 

What confuses little is: Afaik, EU officially decided yet. always, EU matters convoluted mess squabbles. I've read, disagreement countries put recommended list phases.

Portugal example apparently insisted including Brazil Phase 2 everyone else wanted it. Greece meanwhile included lots countries except 9 get tourism back online indicated may move unilaterally.

But since EU mostly free-travel area due Schengen agreement, people agreed need coordinated approach since setting different border policies Schengen countries outsiders would little pointless would prompt countries pull intra-Schengen borders....again.

Which would defeat entire 'reopening' operation. \*Sigh\* remember reading something months ago someone compared Covid similarities HIV sars.

Literally second paragraph smh. De'Santis signed order day lockdown specified hundreds exceptions. Like WWE. Part issue proper testing let alone contact tracing scale started 4 fucking months ago!! one shocked. Nobody wears Texas senile old fart right man last year? would 3 days week kids home?

Schools would better finding new solutions instead trying go back old model We‚Äôre shithole country No, basis like... looking string thousands numbers saying ""Look! find several US telephone area codes here!!"" not, know, significant therefore science worthy conclusion. still believe China's numbers Thanks explaining difference, that's relief least.

It's nothing. let's hope best, heavily depends clubs reopening (since stadiums concerts simply happen) tourism, we've got huge testing coverage enough whole reopening. would've seen second wave already.

While seem like poll could false data, also impossible gather solely experience percentage people entire state wears masks coverage time constraints.  
Flipping around, 80% people US 262,400,000 wearing masks go out, could also counting people go outside either young, classes online, summer break without knowing do. well plethora things. 
While true statistic cover every single person united states, possible took data survey either online in-person populated state(s) scaled rest country. Pretty much. That‚Äôs bit relief.

What - one could still true - turns people Covid lung damage affects rest lives? Cause pulled shit together needed get past first wave virus. US, Brazil, havent done that.

Are Italian? explaining you? think America it‚Äôs death drive. Well maybe poll takes account large areas like New York...where mask use us widespread...and less populous areas may mask deniers given less weight?

There really good solution I've heard yet. massive downsides. 

Unless confirmed kids spread (doesn't make sense know) see open safely places.

Unlike Wuhan January-March, policy seemed deeply flawed even ordinary people, many friends, health care workers, public health experts spoke Chinese social media, government fortunately finally listened closed loopholes.
It appears Beijing loopholes, response fast testing high.
Medical experts expect able boost new boost 0 within 2 weeks.
I go three days Dragon Boat Festival holiday except buy groceries see daughter month, small part Beijing's fight coronavirus.
I also hope U.S. get coronavirus control sooner rather later, U.S. government's policies look like idiots. Yes. Isolating US Putin's plan ever since got peepee tape. continent Africa?

First thing get economy back. economy heavily dependent consumerism, costs money consume. Like older likely money spend, afraid Covid. re-opening help people money stay away. thing make older people money feel safe go back spend money. way get rates down, death rate, hospitalization rate, infection rate. thing ANYBODY wear mask, wash......... know drill.

Many Asian countries great comes mask use. mostly large cities. see lot rural areas.
The reason obvious. Social distancing easy cities like Beijing Tokyo (try taking public transportation Tokyo keep 1 distance everyone). makes great sense effective way protect others.

But US people feel important wear mask walking dog early morning nobody around 500m radius. whole point. situations, social distancing possible, masks great. belief US social distancing bullshit one wear masks time, incredible stupid likely costing many lives.

Define ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù gun laws. explain something like 15rd 9mm handgun insane? Ruger Mini 14 insane? isn‚Äôt insane?

I‚Äôll wait definitions actually debate: happened day America founded self-centred twats. Generations trait condensing reinforcing itself. mean pretty much told masks didn‚Äôt work.

Then told work, leaders openly discouraging people wear them. making big deal Tulsa rally, way hell protest cause spreads. new north opens, increase like rest. Hell, saw videos people crowded areas wearing masks. Disney open Japan yet (will open soon though). Although masks precautions likely prevent epicenter, actually tested yet considering China small number cases now. Hahaha. guys sub hell bent upvoting anything aligns vision world gone shit. nothing cold. Seriously. Everyone overreacted barely anyone died. Go smell roses. say true, less health care much able wfh living multi generational households. See: SF Bay Area vs LA Easter beautiful time. thinking thing weak ass people! went much life even big shifts life bother keep pushing, survive, gotta stay alive! Hard places ridiculously hot, rainy. Also places winter. I've completely turned away WWE. Selfish leadership Important addition: fans attended shows &amp; talent utilized cheer events allowed wear masks. don't. ask students wear masks syllabus, university like that, stay campus everything online.

They fire want. done crap. Naw, perfectly. Expect news article title editor offers next days lol What‚Äôs wrong that? Outdoor spaces minimal transmission. Good decision! really best deal subs. Correct. Trump holier Jesus. Kiss toes. Could be? Well, yeah, think that's exactly is. kind gatherings? Look see greatest case growth (e.g. Florida, Texas, Arizona) also people's attitudes towards wearing masks well stages economic re-opening. work city government managing construction projects densely packed urban streets. rule 100' less anyone including crew residents mask, lol say always wear already. God forbid ask anyone comes put one on. Besides, wore mask office well required provided cloth straps.


It's soooo great city ""cares"" public, employees, er mean ""servants"".


But hey put thank sign office fence last Tuesday. 3 months working 50 hrs week office site entire pandemic. Idk wanna know sign cost, would rather spent 1 bottle water us ffs. walked front line, took DEEEEEEP STRONG BREATH Huffed, Puffed, BLEEEEEW masks off! Everyone immediately looked healthier clapped! supposed explain everyone losing mind? Personally think everyone crazy virus people paying attention whatever. Facebook silo'd people become echo chambers ignorant judge medical training learned everything Internet television wants make personal medical decisions free Americans... become police state like former Soviet block counties 1950‚Äôs 1960‚Äôs. likely millions infected official numbers Laws don‚Äôt usually get police people *how* contract disease. example, lot discrimination gay men AIDS 80s 90s, less others contracted AIDS transfusions. It‚Äôs day wife away. one gone bars? open then? 

Why laws rules all? you‚Äôre going open bars, might well let people drive drunk injure someone, sit back let take personal responsibility. 

Other governors true leaders. gave factual information, enforced safety measures, took advice professionals states steady declining. 

DeSantis said community spread, kids weren‚Äôt effected, took away hospital data, changes numbers around it‚Äôs hard track, said everything fine told people go help economy. reason people actually believed him. reopened early save 10 cents. spend $10,000 fix it.  People protesting wore masks part. sitting inside crowded bar masks hours. Pandemics end two ways: 1. Medically 2. Socially

In medical ending, something changes treat prevent disease medical technology allows us get kind control virus. Sometimes vaccine, sometimes improved treatment, better testing, better contact tracing. virus either eradicated becomes endemic, simply another part vast array viruses serious overwhelming whatever reason. 

But tied medical ending also social ending pandemic. regular existence social beings living large-scale global societies requires accept certain level risk. drive work accept risk car crashes, shower accept could slip fall, etc. normal, non-pandemic times accept there's risk disease internalize risk weigh respond it. Oftentimes risk assessments happen unconsciously, especially West live relatively comfortable lives free intense daily risks like disease (dengue, malaria, etc.). pandemic, risk calculation gets thrown whack new variable equation. moment, many us understand risk others simply much greater acceptable amount baseline risk. change. Eventually either shift risk coronavirus presents, medical ending, shift understanding baseline. 

In likelihood, things happen extent, understand two endings related (dialectically, forgive philosophical jargon lol). Eventually something medical level change, virus could mutate less deadly, develop kind resistance (not necessarily immunity, longer totally novel experience immune systems), develop better ways treating severe mild cases (we already way these, seems). lower risk something line new baseline risk allowance. Covid-19 probably never go away, like h1n1 never really went away 1919. integrates experience existence like things, threats boons alike, been. missed part says able buy guns whenever want. use argument buy gun 3am Christmas morning? Russia Belarus numbers find hard believe. Actually want blame anyone blame china honestly sound like you‚Äôre grasping straws. ‚Äústreet executions‚Äù going decades.

No, zero reason insisting push middle pandemic. number deaths even decreasing years, yet suddenly protests necessary?

Public outrage injustice gets worse injustice gets worse. pandemic time flaws world get laid bare pretty well, war depression anything. Again, change never come ""good"" time - always come things worst. get together outdoors? Hey-i‚Äôm career counselor tech industry lot students feel transitioning new career field pandemic.

But crux question. Let‚Äôs assume there‚Äôs vaccine, let‚Äôs assume like flu cold viruses can‚Äôt develop ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù.... can‚Äôt imagine - humans - ok intermittent lockdowns forever. point say fuck face risk like face cold flu viruses. buy nice car, expect immediately crash pull lot? accept may get nicks dings time goes use common sense maintenance, you‚Äôll able extract reasonable amount value investment gets totaled dies?

America put huge investment actions irresponsible states rendered 
that investment worthless. dumbass friend went Miami vacation past week. asked afraid virus still rampant, said worth risk ""I guess"" 

Today asked he's okay, said he's leaving today. sent testing resources back home city Depends city. more, others less.

All tiny compared number people going bars restaurants. every single study shows virus actually spreading.

That's amazing thing. We're four months in, we've 2.5 million cases US, half MILLION people dead around world, 125k dead US, Americans still going, ""it's flu."" 

At worst, WORST, seasonal flu kills 100k entire flu season. 1.25x half time. average flu season, usual number deaths like 62k. we're 2x half time. twice killed 6% cases influenza. Now, yes, think 10x cases COVID realize, makes number much better (in terms deaths cases), going numbers now, MUCH WORSE.

And let's say 10x affected people. 25 million versus 2.5. 125k dead 25 million cases. Ok. Let's compare flu ""it's flu"" crowd. CDC estimating 39 million - 58 million flu cases latest flu season. 25k-62k deaths. 43-68% cases 2x-5x number deaths.

We're yet ""...oh."" We've got long way go get ""...oh."" paddle hill through, ""it's hoax!"" ""it's flu!"" ""let's catch get with,"" (which I'll admit, think said I'd happy 2.5 months ago, knew it. read retracted that). what's worse, people refuse learn. We'll never get ""...oh."" lot us there. rest screaming ""mah freedums"" ""5G!"" ""Bill Gates going inject tracker!""

Revoking citizenship typically countries try block nationals returning home.

Of course removing citizenship blocking entry national still retains citizenship.

Under international law, country cannot ban nationals returning home way arbituary. i.e. cannot block random personal reason. Note *'arbituary'*. international law, country block nationals returning home valid reason (like global pandemic) applied evenly. applies nationals. fair.

For domestic side; varies country country. Many countries means, right, domestically ban reentry citizens.

It's rare happens, happen. example Samoa blocked 8 people returning 4 months ago. mean put good news. however friends areas hard hit riots ad protests fact scared leave homes month get food probably really good thing. especially since things opening month corona imposed restrictions people heading toward grocery stores replenish. Absolutely. Anyone thinking celebs rich people can't pay way around delusional. masks. total shutdown opening gradually region region basis, ramped testing point anyone anywhere get test even symptoms, ramped contact tracing, continues emphasize working home whenever possible. also daily briefings without break like 110 days, easy understand analysis current situation, explanations science, rationales executive orders, reasoning behind phased reopening. think easier populace compliant restrictions actually leader leader. set tone people followed. Damn dude, asking genocide Americans simultaneously stating Americans created it. ever studied history? That‚Äôs tell them. Unfortunately I‚Äôm roommates two choice stay avoid contact them. Cases going state (Oregon) I‚Äôve running personal campaign trying get take seriously. looks like majority starting listen I‚Äôm telling things heat up. What‚Äôs even worse they‚Äôre college graduates paid thousands goto school, yet took long take seriously. shop worked small mom pop operation. 12 welders going anodized aluminum without active ventilation. Painters without respirators, standard PPE protocol. hot shop cnc machines would usually evaporate 5 gallons cutting fluid/coolant shift. doubt kind exposure records. I'm fortune teller anything,

But something tells answer no. actively fucks memory, ability understand things. think accurate say makes dumber, definitely makes forgetful. I‚Äôve saying getting downvoted pessimistic. 

Plain simple, USA fucked greedy selfish power it‚Äôs GG now. 

A whole new world events happen... probably worse.. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs delusional suggestion way based reality! fault can‚Äôt follow it‚Äù. You‚Äôre naive idiot business discussing things like this, you‚Äôre clearly touch. insane story (and mine) prevelent Lyme. spent year going doctor doctor told depressed anxious. one point doctors said needed put psych ward.... one pulled heads asses tested Lyme. 

Whatever going CDC outdated tests data Lyme feel intentional especially waves new modern data Lyme.

Have tried treating Lyme?  Spain's response good overall, feel like falling apart. inlaws house today 1.5 miles nearest beach, every street packed cars. walking getting taxis back cars vehicle access restricted. america third world country? easy. early studies said treatment may effective. Media/Trump people took fact, never properly verified.

In science, get preliminary results, results fact replicate results. hydrochloroquine never properly replicated. Thank gosh. planned visiting family EU summer. majority? Absolutely not. However grew affluent educated area also conservative. Ultimately believe extremely limited scientific literacy country really demonstrates that. Lol ok dude, hate Cuomo much (and he‚Äôs governor) Cuomo‚Äôs ineptitude didn‚Äôt lead 100,000+ nursing home deaths. Stop hyperbolic reasonable discussion. 

Total COVID deaths tells bad outbreak *was*, bad outbreak *currently is.* Florida 2000 new confirmed cases daily, New York 300, who‚Äôs worse shape exact moment time? New York outbreak, bad, corrected course got it. Florida, Arizona, Texas, many states watched New York shit bed see content letting happen now. fact probably dangerous novel pandemic virus see lifetime, acting like it‚Äôs cold. turning 1930s. booking tramp steamer soon enough.

Why allowed gloat not?? fair comrade. give views youtube? Yeah, believe experienced probably norm. I‚Äôm Philly don‚Äôt see anyone wearing them. I‚Äôve spoken live NJ, theyre compliant well. rest country idiots. Please poop beach. made right? Except wrong, Georgia open restaurants two weeks ago ALOT bars open. Even ones open allowed 35% capacity ton regulations. Depends when. Assumptions made argument, assumed visit would fully dime, school program, family back home sending trip, responsibility left behind like job family. vacation Europe luxury get experience, anr admit jealous self. Downvote want F-U teachers unions. teacher saw union protect physically abusive teacher beat students classroom. tried report advised 'let go'. seeing students leave classroom bleeding bruised picked phone called police. 

Teachers union swooped protected teacher kept job. inner city parents care. told crossed union lines would find without job. union also told would 'find something' aka blackmail tow line. business friendly version would compulsory licencing. mean, whatever say then, it‚Äôs stupid Europe fewer cases us. *gunshots intensify* Similar US, federal government doesn‚Äôt give shit. State governments step act, better, worse. case new here, ressit mods pretty PC, trump detractors. area, would say actually pretty accurate number. Wish luck, hopefully you‚Äôll able go!

I don‚Äôt think last presidents going back including Nixon many scandals Trump alone. Bat-Men mean.  think fine long curve flattening sounds like karen central contacts people live work them. 

We call tell quarantine get tested themselves; there‚Äôs enough lag incubation contacts don‚Äôt symptoms yet call them, would gone get tested quarantined hadn‚Äôt called. helps keep people home possible incubation period (and get letter work, even don‚Äôt symptoms test results). 

That said, cases contact tracers keep with, eventually defeat purpose, we‚Äôre two weeks behind, takes week get test results, original patient probably time call. okay county April May, go back tomorrow I‚Äôve seen numbers, we‚Äôre quickly approaching point becomes fruitless. :/

That said, gather data symptoms, mass gatherings they‚Äôve attended, onset dates, long run, information still helpful studying spread, even don‚Äôt directly stop new cases happening. every country significantly reduced case numbers issue essential workers. It‚Äôs clear countries protected better US did, also followed science-based reopening protocols. new case graphs show pretty clearly states trouble following protocols, trouble protecting essential workers poor compliance public.

You‚Äôre 100% responsible yourself. don‚Äôt blame , it‚Äôs logical thing do. USA states already doubling cases every three days. Tx Fl new cases day, case numbers huge week, death count seen growing 14 days, due usual, predictable, time lag stupid behaviors, mortal results them. see point agree it.

I guess best thing would continue remote instruction periodic testing. numbers go stay down, think returning school. Yeah basically Afghanistan now. many no-go zones. cucked HARD. completely ignore children raped, scared virus kill 49 years lol Yep! true. Sigh, please live illusion yourself. I‚Äôve NYC twice past three months, recently one weeks ago 80% midtown Manhattan masked. incredible. walking street biking without them, otherwise almost everyone masked. suspect stores it‚Äôs close 100% mask wearing. , I'm not, suffer million health issues anyway everybody attributes ""anxiety"" despite red ring leg 7 years ago.

I likely bankrupted future I'm dependent. news past couple days. New York Times thought worth publishing... Look statistics work instead asking random people. Lmao every country gonna try keep us  anyone could praising China / CCP letting virus escape joke. CCP gets rich people die across globe. awesome! Great job CCP! sure.

Jalisco one mandated use masks. Here‚Äôs thing, quarantine ‚Äúended‚Äù June 1st. Since we‚Äôve using traffic light system, red pretty much quarantine again, yellow reduced occupancy mask use, green normal. whole country started red, states going yellow people caring less less. cases spiked month, would‚Äôve thought?

As cases surge country people ask ‚Äúcould done something prevent this?‚Äù Ok cool, keep fun. well family, dream traveling abroad well beyond finances, alright. 

If manage well dual citizenship, im assuming European countries. one Ireland, never many family members less off. Let's open worms. younger adult ties lease ever freely travel, guess upper class. representive people US deal with. thisis interesting theory protests may triggered overall spikes.

while protesters went everyone else (most population) stayed home scared violence went much Although evidence outdoors reduces transmission ultimate goal eliminate infection.
I'm jumping trying helpful feel narrative reduced transmission gives people excuse risky behavior.
Just like warm temps killing C-19 south buying it. fact many americans think pray way safety part problem Thanks Yep, politics mods *Bringing whole crew*

Especially international travel limited. long though? want one obnoxious tourists, packed places like would freak out. wanted explore, starting Oma's hometown, Mannheim, Germany. Question: report new confirmed cases, people currently including people take antibody test stating one point? greed referring greed wage slaves. another clue: economy set way huge universal threat like covid comes along, many participants system choose health starvation? Comrade, 5 European countries worse USA per capita!

Your bias obvious, need careful want influence people! important? uncle used go university really close Canada, told weekends roommates would stay night Canada drink I‚Äôve often wondered jurisdictions behaviour like might reasonably fall fraud. concealment important facts, intentional misrepresentation, victim may incurred loss health health expenditure, perpetrator received presumed monetary political benefit choosing perpetrate fraud. 

I really don‚Äôt legal background anything wild idea. Eventually stay-at-home orders need issued, number deaths increasing... Slowest fucking window I've ever heard of. lot less people infect helping learn lot indoor dining starts think. Right; it‚Äôs possible though. Still, hospitalizations rising now, deaths rise bit that. Yeah people praising Europe order shit US far perfect guys seem think Going get antibody test Wednesday questions! (Sorry anxiety shows):

1. accurate they? I‚Äôm going LabCorp heard 99.9% good. also heard mixed things well.

2. bad hurt? haven‚Äôt given blood while. Sort forget it‚Äôs bad not. someone speak this? Thanks! could've use brain like person did. many americans ignorant good things bad things US.

This argument falls apart physically spent time there, fucking hated never wanted step foot again. Europe sucks, every country sucks different reason, still suck. don't, lot symptoms ehler danlos syndrome, often hand hand hypermobiliy risk sounding super liberal elitist really think majority Americans voted Trump capable reading understanding scientific journal? late, America chance due pure negligence. virus run course now. Agreed. supposed visiting friends Germany soon, many dumb fucks country care themselves. Well least you‚Äôre partially self aware stupid sound guess I'm hyperindividualist.

I still wear mask ask others to. Ironic. Healthcare ‚Äúfree‚Äù ANYWHERE Planet. 

Europeans PAY healthcare taxes call ‚ÄúFREE Healthcare‚Äù.

There indication virus anything like AIDS. horrible US police attacks peaceful protesters. Please answer OP! actual doctor no. Dr. Oz maybe. One forefront pandemic? Absolutely not. Smart choice. Hold world, start normalcy process November. people wearing mask lockdown lifted. [feb 21: says window closing poor minority students left behind ""issue""? American Pediatrics Association states schools open person.

 know anyone personally whose died? dont understand term really means. always percentage percentage affects fast new person carrying disease spread population.

if roads central point open one immunity spread fastest. percentage roads radiating point blocked disease spreads less quickly. think blocked roads people immunity prior infection vaccine explains importance. COVID far list when, live community exponential spread, chances getting high? argument impulsive guess, you‚Äôre watching what‚Äôs happening TX, FL AZ, know situation dire. That's 40% Americans give shit coronavirus sub, seeing contents sane among us. Summer camps still come also Europe‚Äôs concern different America‚Äôs concern. asking deaths went much overnight, long term. think taking action based available data entirely possible. That's life, work have, know, course correct later new information becomes available.

Personally, way data collected COVID varied, many confounding variables, many political angles globally, say nothing US, I'm sure useful *comparing* data nations/states/cities is. messy. bigly like magic me, 50% posts sub, reposts posts obvious things? travel ban pretty obvious already underway awhile, news-worthy all. Yeah, made comment cuz another one pretty funny. Protest data? think he's expert; said, he's huge public figure draws attention. 

Maybe that's it. random PhD working vaccine giving opinion draw many clicks sadly seeing ""Bill Gates"" headlines.

But that's America. celebrities mores trustworthy actual physicians scientists. reference something? better mask ventilator. doubt ones grandstand refuse enter drs office told put mask. Thank fuck Swede tell masks important thing. mask help don‚Äôt adhere social distancing. Fill subway train people wearing masks you‚Äôve achieved nothing. turned situation around without almost anyone wearing masks. Social distancing 101. supposed Ireland Monday night Hella Mega tour. üò¢ Lol Japan China 100% aren‚Äôt reporting actual number cases, guess I‚Äôd say countries fudging numbers too. Thankfully virus isn‚Äôt really problem unless you‚Äôre old fat, it‚Äôs annoying work involves international travel. seems silent wall place already. It‚Äôs direction talked about. FUCK MAH RIGHTS

/s Gonna post response posted earlier: reasons: First, treatment getting better. Second, early people without fever advised get tested many people mild symptoms didn‚Äôt think went normal routines. Third, safeguards become norm reducing amount virus people exposed to. Fourth, people risk fatal outcomes protected protecting themselves. Fifth, prolonged indoor exposure risk reduced significantly working home, cancelling large events, etc. Thank that. I‚Äôm scared. okay messaging you? could use reassuring voice life right now. friend starting understand real threat is? Nothing find outside EU reference company‚Äôs claims.

I'm always baffled amazing ignorance Westerners. Stand graves 125,000 dead Americans tell ""great"" country handled covid well.

While civilised world moving forward opening up, we're cringing embarrassment USA.  Come TURKEY Can't Americans fly one approved countries (assuming also ban Americans) fly anywhere Europe? Closing bars restricting dine-in restaurants solution. It‚Äôs reactive response problem well hand... it‚Äôs necessary one. 

Texas closed bars 2nd time. hit hit ICU base capacity greater Houston Governor ordered reduction elective procedures free ICU space. (A necessary step). However quickly got called reducing hospital‚Äôs revenue stream nothing bars restaurants.. largest contributing factors reason ICU capacity reached first place. 

So no. move on. pretending happening anyone thinking it‚Äôs issue bars dine-in restaurants operate, even meet policy guidelines (which unrealistic). Even establishments cross Ts dot Is, pretending patrons perfect rule abiding individuals willful ignorance, regardless age. day one, don‚Äôt trust others seemed best guide follow.

If drive beach, it‚Äôs PACKED, it‚Äôs make adult decision go home. you‚Äôre immersed you‚Äôd surprised quickly learn new language Same... seen family (Lithuania) year, three planned flights canceled. Probably see another year.

MILFs hate it!

Find hot arrogant assholes area new Seems pretty much inevitable actually based US Brazil's attitude. 9500+ cases one day!? spitting others mouth what!? rights infringe someone elses rights. like freedom speech yelling bomb plane illegal putting others risk. Asian culture different western / European culture though. far willing obey authority there's never vaccine? Japan shutdown. Based message i'm guessing teens. Consider young one:  Left Right losing games. Find way form unique opinion outside 2 options. Trump Biden shit options follow. logic ""choosing lesser 2 evils"" hold up. airline permanently ban them

IMO would work. airlines banded together held others bans. possible, find unlikely. notify law enforcement, unruly passenger?

Sure could. passenger caused actual disturbance expect would. However reality we're talking person taking mask putting back on. flight attendant telling ""Sir, need wearing mask land."" passenger saying ""Well I'm wearing stupid mask.""

I find unlikely flight attendants would push much air. would want conflict. real option ban. 

The flight attendant could carry landed disembarked inform authorities happened. could work. find extremely unlikely though. 

Here guess why: family EU would like visit right now. so, however would need quarantine 14 days land. Cases USA, live, charts. much would like make trip cannot risk anyone else's health unnecessary travel! going. one flying too. airlines already losing money.  restaurants bars people flying either 
extremely pressing reasons assholes care anyone themselves. 

Same restaurants/bars recently reopened, disastrously, many states airlines want money. care much someone wearing mask. care revenue.  mask policies window dressing cover liability someone gets COVID flight attempts sue them. win. airline took every measure could. person got sick able prove contracted virus.

The airline got money. death. happens PLAYER gets Covid complications. Imagine happens Giannis Zion Luka catch bug either can't play lose huge part effectiveness? Total insanity reopen. think one ever teach? Get ignorant fuckwit. work hair salon heart surgeon tell boss masks worthless. argue someone supposed know better? Since said boss feels vindicated belief. also got pulled conversation bon fire another woman railed niece nurse said pointless. want stay home go around people. Hmm, might want get covid antibody test. Hope get buddy. Actually hadn‚Äôt thought it, article argues due fear protests people wouldn‚Äôt normally done actually stayed home, weren‚Äôt getting birthday party whatever would normally gone offsetting increases protests. difference Curacao start proceedings full independence tomorrow Netherlands let go. Hong Kong? chance. FFS people ignorant fuck. Make mandatory incur fine every time don‚Äôt. asinine statement ever read. shows complete lack responsibility really blame situation. Sadly, type attitude killing people. idiots would listened health officials middle pandemic thrown damn party first place, none would happened. one would sick. one would died. think that's launched it. seem think flu virus virus year year not. probably moron saw party public birthday...Lot's tourists, masks, distancing... making strangers wHat? love turned around cars new york. Oh worm turned Jesus mate, better true. waves virus. way mitigate dead lock like standing garden hose, stepping off. Rinse repeat - like that. It‚Äôs time payback. fake death make MIL know ‚Äúkilled‚Äù you. dinosaurs created Chinese lab know it!

Oh, issue looking every angle things. saying take seriously may frustrated afraid inaction/counterproductive action around real life.

Thanks appreciate it. too. far I‚Äôve done phone/Zoom appearances. bigger concern long office tries make come in. courts social distancing inside.. office? Less so. Serious talk. one restaurant town guy really food particular....  said there's point open right HAH! appear criminal charges already.

Covid illness that, recovered, leaves lifelong ailments difficulties.  provided parachute. hope make requirement wash hands using bathroom. way patriots proudly proclaim refuse wash hands using bathroom. right /r/coronavirus doomers, however, evidence suggests risk spread virus large gatherings people far smaller tried pretend was.

FTFY Depends. unions threaten employees families, slash tires, break windows, etc. Union reps supposed go bat employees whether they‚Äôre union member not, actually throw bus agree management pretty cut dried cases employee mistreated pulling stops protect union member matter egregious infractions. That‚Äôs union experience, I‚Äôve read much worse. ~ I‚Äôm less worried food packaging. 

 I‚Äôm worried servers, shouldn‚Äôt table service right now. I‚Äôm American, emigrated decade ago. I‚Äôve noticed shift normally intelligent friends lately. ones board lockdown. think people broken. can‚Äôt handle more. want take trips planned long ago. want plan flights next year. 

Nobody wants accept going YEARS things get even close normal. It‚Äôs going long vaccine developed, ever is. Motherfucker please: Yeah shitty situation, where, frankly, protesting covid might worse outcome shitty outcomes. Bruh, would left let serve 30 days since servers. Damn even covid respects blm.

You need parties there. I'm saying challenges. are. Even older kids.

But there's challenges education anyway. perfectly satisfied before? wasn't. 

But choices today. Remote learning vs rolling dice health. recently 8 year old die area. many children's deaths person learning worth? 

Another problem kids going much better online environment. kids going lose go back. 

It's going hard. Hard lots people. safest option we've got. get kid back suffer something long term die disease? politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jared-kushner-combat-coronavirus-facebook-127941 president thinks letting virus run rampant kill voters opposing party. comparison Chinese facilities good, raises question India preparing 10x casualty count Wuhan. unstated answer Indians caused situation become 10x worse due citizen failure comply lockdown, government failure make lockdown work. is, India's government people done better job, none would necessary all.

Younger people majority infected, true, article *also* says 40% Southerns Obese comorbidities negate age argument, article CDC director even said US healthy nations shouldn‚Äôt assume surge fine.

On wider argument number deaths: yes numbers going down, going slowly nations, stabilised week. Last week first week 2 months new cases previous week. know, death count lag couple weeks.

This article tries put lipstick pig. 

Further, research emerging everywhere quite long term issues coming survivors this, celebrating people getting sick. 

And lastly, article basically said need continue everything possible get sick. 

The headline dangerous misinforming public saying getting COVID still fuck up, even don‚Äôt die. wrong. testing, positivity would increasing. Arizona day week 20%. Mhmm.

the point he's saying protesters prosecuted responsible thing 38.693 new cases 1.109 deaths, think biggest numbers we've saturday Florida needs close back  Nah. issue virus take huge leaps larger gatherings, compared smaller ones. moves slowly people don‚Äôt go large events. There‚Äôs literally nothing contend here. see people panicing told virus. interesting study, take grain salt.

Reported btw harassment. Headline 2021: America's failed response Covid19, experts worry worst yet come... issue US saying great nation.

To say greatest 250 years existed, laughable best.

We nations lasted near millennia, foundation modern thought, mathematics, science, philosophy...

There comparison. US many hundreds years get infancy potentially become one greatest nations.

And question:  (Valid whole EU) always baffled amazing ignorance Westerners.

I'm baffled chinese people always believe us party! haha, use get rich. never actually got diagnosis. gave up, even though I've weird health issues ever since. diagnosed anxiety disorders instead.

Thing is, doxycycline another condition years ago think made difference. still vitiligo spot ring was. Haha copy pasta? 

Maybe stop relying consuming? system clearly doesn‚Äôt work. Nothing going wake people though. Congratulations; self-proclaimed ""greatest country earth"" better poverty-stricken third world nations.

Keep setting bar high. Zero surge? What‚Äôre talking about? We‚Äôve surging AZ CA 2 weeks upon time...  impossible see anything conclusive time. People staying inside, outside, people wearing masks probably reduced bad could been. see people counted now.

What dint see counted yet asymptomatic mildly symptomatic people got covid protests go doctor get tested.

These people show indirectly pass covid loved ones get sick get tested analysts study numbers well.

There tons people falling symptomatic category protestors young. yet know later asymptomatic folks people spread covid counted, numbers outweigh numbers stayed home covid.

Looking tightly packed protesters compared number residents living areas protests held, would say way, way people attending protests people staying indoors them.

The protestors playing Russian roulette people's lives nothing certain right now. turns blank gets fired, still mean right choice playing Russian roulette all. Ehh seems pretty obvious city trail LA places packed. anger seems misplaced. Yes, yes are. Go pack move somewhere else prove easy current climate. answer ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt need to‚Äù fuck zero business telling people situation aren‚Äôt in. Yes remember spike comes spread others. That's another week newly infected never even attended rally another spread around. evidence contrary would love see Sadly not. Oh, yes, *please* take us *leader*... Things relatively similar next year. promise. mean point, cases rise people social distance wear masks more. hope current understanding virus affects children correct byproduct assuming disease manifestation would same.

Because would profoundly bad busy focusing double lung interstitial pneumonia completely ignored virus behaves children.  Here‚Äôs sobering thought-

If bird flu evolves consistent human human transmission, guarantee people go back ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù.

In case, though, they‚Äôd realize that‚Äôs dumb excuse week tops. Ok again, average American job entire starstoshpere exist within nearest schools district Amazon distubtion hub. People US travel like Europe Asia. probably explains surging cases young people didn‚Äôt stay home went protests. Now, cases applied protests, fact 2-3 weeks seeing surges young people leads believe contraCted Protests.

agreed. fit data. Crap, I‚Äôve feeling lot persistent fatigue lately compared normal. don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve infected tho. Maybe get tested. shut shit down. Everyone else follow suit cuz happen anywhere else opening up. Oh wait.....that makes much sense....ü§î Windows closed. Board see 6 months Definitely poke poke article. make study cross contamination like touching face? washing hands Ask/look idiot top. That's how. Electricity? car? Factory production? weekend? Atomic energy? ymca dance? Exactly, need stop dividing eachother though us them. We're sinking ship, either work together we're food fishes think that's true. horrible view I've heard let run rampant, bad, there's nothing anyway.

How propose get ""one accord?"" Protests help us Sadly amount evidence change minds loved one becoming seriously ill Covid19, whimper ‚Äòthis real‚Äô ; it‚Äôs really getting hard want wish Ill ignorantly endanger lives now.  least wore masks, think closed high risk places relatively sooner US. keep things open.

Why defensive? Herd immunity might achieved 43% population becomes immune coronavirus, mathematicians University Nottingham University Stockholm wrote article Science.

So mathematicians running numbers infectious disease writers caution estimates interpreted way showing population differences affect herd immunity, rather providing precise prediction.

And mathematicians caution also noted computer model works idea people catch virus immunity ‚Äúan extended period time,‚Äù that‚Äôs case models It‚Äôs certain people catch coronavirus become immune it, become immune, long lasts. Recent research small group participants indicated people who‚Äôve tested positive, especially don‚Äôt show symptoms, may lose antibodies couple months.

And warnings read mathematician article's author.

I seen actual experts infectious disease predict low number. read experts caution herd immunity might possible without vaccine. Second this, foh staff place im makes double salary works less hours. work back house, need get life together. even need lock everyone up. need kind, calm, safe. it. 

South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand managed. hey, let's put aside island nations (obviously pretty great advantage) Asian nations may different cultural aspects.

Canada around 500 new daily cases, less 10% Florida reporting almost twice population. Keep mind chases tied old folks homes longer term care facility.

In province 5 million people currently 22 people hospital, 5 ICU. 10 new cases today.

We go restaurants, breweries, get haircuts, go gym, go movies etc. appropriate distancing safety measures course.

Turns follow public health recommendations dick. Same. It‚Äôs pretty blatant Well...so much Easter disappearance. Yup, could years premature deaths drawn time. crass.

Yes, point desire behave humans behave push us accept low risk covid death pushes us accept low risk flu death accidental death. course, come kind shift risk death serious suffering side equation too, right coronavirus looms much larger threat flu car wreck afforded additional attention. also new factor, gets focused much result (much like people much concerned terrorism planes car ride airport, one newer, flashier, attention grabbing). eventually get kind medical help, either body's natural response (even without long-term neutralizing immunity*) new medical breakthroughs (even without vaccine!). allows us let guard speak. dystopian scenario live lives constant fear pathogen simply fantasy.

*I feel like also clarify bit immunity. seem impression immunity on/off switch, really much sliding scale. Even bodies can't form life-long, close it, immunity virus, like smallpox measles, form kind resistance. resistance could look like body able turn virus cold bug recognizing attacking faster, something else like that. even without vaccine medical treatment beneficial mutation, even absolute immunity impossible, virus trend towards less dangerous becomes endemic human population.

""the virus spread outside"" argument started used people want explain protesters dispersed, told practice social distancing. actually saw one Joe Biden's people say Trump rally reckless protests thousands people shoulder-to-shoulder major cities wasn't.  


Of course virus spread people jammed space close quarters. matter they're next dome open stadium, close close. athletes risk----but tested stepping foot court, field, pitch. spectators can't.  


The ""virus spread outside"" means outside avoid within close distance people, OK. That's found kind overreach Florida closed parks, including bike trails middle nowhere. What‚Äôs 0.2% 50 million? answer I‚Äôll many people died. please, stop. Americans proven stupidity last 4 months. get it.

Yeah, true. watched youtuber coverage riots several days. daytime protests good deal masks, starting 10pm, masks maybe 50%, masks chins. Shouting slogans mask usage go together well.

- people wear mask closed spaces like shops, malls, offices
- people sanitize hands wherever go spread whatever purpose
- people keep distance interacting socially. Ideally 6ft, even 4ft drastically better really close.
- shops malls offices limit number people inside given time everyone comfortably keep distance.

Combine agressive contact tracing new cluster appears basic plan return less normal. total lockdown basically panic switch prevent mass casualties healthcare system collapse can't, should, used long term. Yes. But, also, people need punished following rules. whats consensus incrediblly low death rates singapore qatar?

But isn‚Äôt false. It‚Äôs cherry picking. It‚Äôs looking data making correlations. I‚Äôm cherry picking data. keep pointing data form states tested protesters. infection rate remains same. doesn‚Äôt explain increases across US we‚Äôre seeing. 

Again, anyone show data proof contributed rise cases, welcome it. far, one has. Including you. currently doesn‚Äôt exist. 

Have good night medical study. Nope, sorry. state hiding data like OP claims. talking about? 


Did ""Open up"" protests contribute spread?

Did Lake Ozarks mess turn super spreading event?

It's politics. Transmission outside tends low. matter - likely cause much spread. went McDonald‚Äôs made obese, McDonald‚Äôs would banned Oh don‚Äôt believe natural rights?

I believe fairy tales, god, antiquated philosophical beliefs. thank you. dare critizice protests held, racist comment /s 100% correct. able get insurance soon, COVID pre-existing condition able use deny coverage. would say *if* data continues suggest protests major factor, interesting tease why.

Instead posting cryptic conspiracy messages tell us you‚Äôre talking link articles offenses? Poor Renee Young &amp; others infected looting burning cop cars?

But legally open carrying instead?

Lol, OK house? Yeah cause users reddit trusted Stanford, Oxford, WHO, CDC. taking thought experiment further: ‚Äúsmart thing‚Äù rest life always best option?

Have ever eaten unhealthy meal, drank alcohol? That‚Äôs smart, it?

If never develop vaccine treatment COVID, never build herd immunity, would *smart* socially distance forever. would *best* thing do? point risk COVID outweighed risk live socialize freely? 

It‚Äôs tough question ask, important one. can‚Äôt everyone go home... even wear mask? even touch everyone everything? moment forward, shall refer glasses ""the devil's spectacles"" Oh hey, thing heard probable back March. like taking batteries fire alarms. article posted /r/coronavirus subreddit earlier:

I understand reasons tiptoe around reason failed get control nation, definitely 600 pound non-human primate room. Keep looking, people licking shit frequent may know.......... country implying? would think country ....hmmmm days, wish old. feel old already. true. Can‚Äôt shoot virus. Well, desired effect. get saying think need nuance saying need authoritarian leadership, cuz sounds like want US democracy (cough, oligarchy). mean needs centralized response decisions made executed efficiently, right? think doable would make sense ""normal"" buildings, really expensive important places. I'm also guessing would expensive. Oh don‚Äôt believe natural rights???

Well probably aren‚Äôt gonna get much anywhere. basic ideas philosophies different. But... word 'American' company. kept people home"" without measurable evidence argument bad faith.

Actually measured it. article:

*The researchers used cell-phone tracking data Safegraph see percentage population leave home big cities protests, compared cities didn‚Äôt protests.*

*The results clearly linked increase stay-at-home behavior civil unrest. Curfews played part behavior completely account it.* Florida changed anything light numbers? example, Texas closed bars limited restaurant capacity. actual fuck? know re-election year?? say that? Ohio department health data already available here: hiding anything, contrary misleading title. Karen it. can? doubt.i don‚Äôt think anyone nukes. I‚Äôd expect lot coming near future certain areas states Right. people die instead. suffer lingering effects rest lives. makes anecdotal evidence stronger others? Foot drop affect anyone who‚Äôs bedridden long time. hospital adequately staffed shouldn‚Äôt happen. means probably one around notice body‚Äôs positioning enough give foot boot make sure foot plantar flexed position then. put shoes person bed also get foot plantar flexion.

The thing happen hands. several states across US planning administering bar exam next month... convention centers... 1,000+ people... two day exam, eight hours day... can't believe indoor dining catastrophe changed state supreme court's minds.

as recent graduate take bar exam, I'm terrified health family, can't believe I'm faced ultimatum ""take exam become lawyer worried health."" Also me, personally, no, think better keep social distancing, minor social interaction there, me, going pub overweight lives, matter what, however know 90% people disagree, hey opinions, they're fine. (This talking endless, never ending, lockdown scenario) one countries large gatherings banned? Right, weeks, basically pre-covid unrestricted. no. He‚Äôs putting fans first. /s get benefit without house them. see absolute win. Lol believing humans born inherent rights free antiquated.

Yeah I‚Äôd rather antiquated bootlicker Looks like biggest problem Florida approach Floridians prioritized public health containing virus might happened. may late, but, damn, getting real close. I'd bet money reason Mnuchin disclose publicly bailout money went went Ponzi Scheme firms over-leveraged CLOs true 2008 fashion. sudden alt right isn‚Äôt mad protests anymore? thats actually good point better leader could made states open prematurely funding.

Without health confidence, economy Always liked delta keep liking delta bring several good points, however last couple lines made laugh. Sorry it‚Äôs truth. hope worth it. Honest question, people outside U.S. really clueless American culture actually is? pandemic response totally predictable, gone different major issue U.S. since least Iraq war. confused? trying spread parents

Here best way that:

- Stay home unless absolutely necessary 

- go out, wear mask, stay 6 ft minimum people, get get asap 

- Wash hands touching surface didn‚Äôt personally disinfect outside home environment. Vigorous washing 20 seconds warm water include fingers fingernails

- go make sure wipe items brought back Clorox and/or leave garage 3-14 days depending material. Strip clothes directly washing machine take shower immediately getting home. 25% United States. times utter idiot charge... agree. us part anti-intellectual movement need rise shut dumb fucks politicians push bullshit.

Hi all, anyone know quickly you‚Äôll start feeling covid symptoms? soon exposure, quickly you‚Äôll go feeling healthy feeling sick. mom (a nurse recently around covid-positive patient) feeling fine last night suddenly started feeling sick. went completely normal extreme aching pain less 12 hours. typical covid? arrested leaving court without case resolved. 

No shit need give 14 days experienced symptoms yet (which already have). 10 days recommendation (with three straight days fever without fever reducer) people experienced symptoms. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get happened me, doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù Arizona going euthanize people like Italy?

Is Plan Plan B? really like Swedish strategy sustainable is. Deaths back normal, icu levels decreasing life essentially goes changes. give people space, wash hands often pure instinct on. 

Sure save lives costs honorable absolutism can't truly argued living uncertainty government quarantine say 600 000 people like Germany contrasted something really changed since March Reading put funk. Probably days. Sorry deal that. Sorry I'm rude type news get upvotes good news almost upvotes.

Many point recent Black Lives Matter protests, brought hundreds thousands people streets together. asked specifically protests, director L.A. county health department, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, repeatedly said feels **the spike correlates closely general reopening people getting going back work.**

I'm sorry though personal situation. made need express concerns family: honest tell really feeling. escalated guilty Finally, decrease military! Yeah, keep censoring ideas like. Fuck you, fatty.

We're going open discussion whether want not. problem people going decide point view want find pay expert back up. obviously there's lot money rich would favor opening back ""taking burden poor sending back work"" die.

I find ""lockdowns put much burden poor"" argument 100% unconvincing. Lockdowns put burden wealthy. working puts burden (deaths) poor. way looks right thusly: yes, opinion :::::

This virus eradicated. vaccine effective strain, virus mutate come back year year, meaning year year looking different vaccines, like flu vaccines, thats troubling part.

The troubling part whether infection rate stays high is. so, expect infections, deaths, also say shit go dormant all.....

Meanwhile, infected may immune, long different strain yet seen, meanwhile got dealing long term health effects virus.....

and virus comes again, again, again....

The survivors may wind vulnerable result regardless age, end fodder next wave, on......until? Well, either physically adapts survive/overcome other....

Nature may finally found superior virus cull human species predecessor AIDS, primarily transmitted sexual intercourse - himdering act procreation.

Pretty dark shit, yes. I‚Äôm hoping get better news virus next months ie : it‚Äôs deadly anymore, it‚Äôs actually dying like said, controlled humankind like flu prevent many deaths witnessed thus far serious ass vaccine work.....

We shall see. Right though, well....terrified current turn events. 

Its like watching movie Jaws. shoot barrel shark keep afloat catch it, shark manages take barrell water it, left foiled...and surprised....and horrorified.... he‚Äôs full shit. KC pretty high rate infection rn. live MO look numbers every day. Seems like there's bit morality projection here. indoor space unmasked people close-ish proximity banned. I'm wrong though. live next large college &amp; tourist city. local student bar opened early June something like three days, closed back down. Last week, 150 new cases got traced directly back three days bar open. 

Probably whole load co-inhabitant spread going people past weeks. really starting show -- county put 1,000 new cases today; ten times pace growth at. Neighboring counties seeing multiplicative increase. You're*

Also, please tell /s sounds dumb I'm even going waste time reading article. Press 'X' doubt results representative, tests done material people came contact health system.

I would ask people US dying countries. beat you. tests = zero cases

deaths = 100  Yeah bullshit, experience. EVERYBODY WEARS MASKS

Do hate freedom? Basic surgical masks China (which vast majority masks made) effective virus way effective fabric ideal accessory everyone wearing masks. Someone gave birth Yeah hospital Covid wasnt ventilator. talked friends day sick, seemed like would survive. next morning died suddenly hospital believed stroke type death bc progress made able get make calls. Seemed relatively good spirits too. 

The fucked thing made much worse died day father laws funeral (teeny service whatever arrangements) also got Covid. husband two kids high school level loss timing brutal. husband way town arrangements dad got news wife passed. viral load low enough big problem solid contact tracing place. Wear mask lot COVID deniers keep missing point. current infected **will** infect vulnerable population people flood hospitals.

Remember Hospital ship Comfort New York? might see Florida within two weeks. Laughs Floridian Please, sir, may more? airborne \*\*\*'s. Part testing. getting 30K cases barely tests likely well 100K day. let‚Äôs totally ignore non-existent test rates Africa South Asia. Whatever floats boat. Infinite stupidity selfishness. words That's seeing people. that's case that's wed since would much cheaper driving seeing people. life meaningful life life meaningful important. feel minimize life many others endangered. Take care. I'm sorry family going this. &lt;3 draw conclusion data link? birthday plans sound like dream tbh Yea, wish studies. wear masks running, get passed lot cyclists. wish would also wear masks I'm sorry realize educated people Johns Hopkins. truly walking amongst giants here. Good day sir, please let great intellect offended. Serious question. masked costumers even work restaurant? wear seated, ordering etc, remove eating put back on? really bit security theater ?

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW think dine eating form good idea right now. ever googled ""how cook burger"" ? seem dedicated making others vote someone responsible large amount death suffering.

That you.

I never suggested anyone vote anyone. Everyone else did. agenda. I'm trying convert anyone. That's doing. Vote. Don't. give fuck.

You trying accuse like you. Based objective fact, either understand situation, agenda.

Based analysis, probably both! like nightmare deja vu. We're starting back Westchester again. Freedom taxes pay healthcare pays corporations make billions. 

Also don‚Äôt want go emergency clinic bankrupt you. don‚Äôt want call police emergency beat even kill you. need buy guns protect guns laying around people‚Äôs houses. Free testing. Anyone anywhere insurance required. 18 sort ID. 
Went Wednesday 6 hour wait 4th needs cancelled. Completely. Stay home America. Based what? why? making sense. saying DoD favoring Bill Gates Amazon? so, why? saying Bill Gates sway DoD? Like what?

Facts, let's hear facts.   Try r/misinformation r/pseudoscience upvotes. Confirmed cases. Based CDC said, probably around 25 million. clear definitive proof? Weird. pinpoint date March 2005 came flu. recovered week two later went depression bet of, panic attacks couple years following. also remarked people haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúhappy‚Äù since March 2005. parents emigrated Vietnam.

I'm high risk think catch it, I'd rather safe sorry. I'm fortunate enough able work home, thank you. Getting certain fast food item really gives sense normal helps fight depression. Hopefully deaths continually stay low trends even lower. Also waiting Dr. Fauci give public firm answer, said last briefing probably 10x infections. firm answer much calming public, coupled death rate keeps trending lower, least FL go process like strict shut contain virus, basically impossible stage. I'm still cautiously optimistic stage since data cases surge point hopeful situation.

I wonder task force give guidelines reopening base death rate going forward. go 0.9 0.8% confirmed cases, mandatory mask order entering businesses. reopening continue. number people type 1 diabetics COVID destroyed pancreas hope get well.

I went college guy diagnosed MS. Enfeebled him, made shell was. never gave up. Kept pushing, putting one foot front other. two years treatments god knows much adversity, he‚Äôs turned around. Last year finally got back running marathons, supposed whole lot COVID.

Keep stick ice good things happen. Probably less NY. Estimates infected testing showed lower testing volume March. prefer fog glasses thank much Journalism failing us almost badly elected officials. Spit proven good gold standard. Can't wait see, people react 2-3 people world suffer side effects. (because always some) 
""See, told vaccines bad"" Recycled air get sick airplane. air run hospital grade filters whole volume replaced outside every 3 minutes. Plus there's tons movement, like breezy day outdoors. danger plane person next perhaps behind you. That's it. Something happening us.

So, COVID-19 becomes zombie infecting cells like HIV Smallpox.

And hijack immune system like HIV.

And COVID-19 like cancer highjacks grows unchecked bodies like malignancy. 

It cause nerve damage, brain damage, lung damage, kidney damage, alter blood/vascular system.

Consequently people often pulled mask *off* order talk. Physical distancing also difficult.

Right, remember, surgical cloth type masks protect others protect you. believe need \*at least\* N95 rated masks really chance catch it. Yeah. People want ""one reason"" growth that's simple, easy explain gives many something blame shame. many also obvious political agendas blame.

Reality is, much complex picture rise cases probably linked overall behavior changes Memorial Day weekend. Yes, protests visible change behavior, likely there's lot wider variety things people gone back daily lives:

* wearing mask good example overall behavior increases spread.
* friends indoors social calls/parties often (without mask) probable overall behavior shift.
* Going public places/businesses indoors often (without masks) probable overall behavior shift.

All things large populations cause large amounts cases. protests cause cases? Yes, A) Considering mask compliance, B) Considering outdoors, overall risk protests still low compared larger population shifts behavior. TLDR: protests big visible, rest population consequential. even need ask question may borderline mentally retarded. Anyone two brain cells run together saw coming mile away. confirm. That's *why* moved here, generally speaking. lived CA make money tech entertainment; enjoyed house bought 25 years ago quadrupled value; got tired CA state income tax. 

So! Sell CA house, keep most/all gains selling house tax-free, move TX pay cash buy still-affordable house outright (probably bigger, probably amenities). either work remotely CA company hired them; start business; go semi-retirement want.

Maybe miss friends, beach food. sure like tax-free half-million more. hell, DFW Trader Joes N now, bad. O:-) Embarrassing understatement say least absolutely fucking ridiculous. would great mod would like weigh discussing centralized health authority would good idea relates current system government purely political. shit exist vacuum - there's context needs placed. mean housing really expensive here. I‚Äôd rather better government regulations make things affordable, never happen.

So honestly, make past pandemic, might get great deal house next 2 years. Deaths take anywhere 2 weeks month start match infection curve. think mean parents believe covid conspiracy election. guess parents said thing. Good luck &amp; wish best! :D someone send Dr Brix Dr Fauci masks 'I'm stupid. printed next White House press conference, Pence Trump want pretend 6ft rules masks somehow interfere rights assemble free speech. Im saying anything wrong. Im saying country works poorly people live getting pretty fed it. told every direction kinds fine tunings need, stuff like working healthcare system, reasonable wages, living accommodations dont eat 3/4ths wages, completely table. Combine response virus turning ‚Äúgo work maybe die dont eat, lucky enough job oh well‚Äù, dont know expect people do. expect take lying down, think should. Circle return 100% normal get vaccine There's another serious parallel risk. pre-occupation/overwhelm/destruction health care system U.S. even when/if exponential increase infection goes down, DUE steadily-increasing pool medically compromised/handicapped 'survivors'. 

I've seen figures high 40% healthy people recover long term issues. True, beginning, looks pretty scary point. Especially since, point, Chief Executing convince us, probably himself, COVID magically vanish.

So, already over-burden medical centers seeing people long-term illnesses foreseeable future. MONEY keep open going come from? individual Americans gong pay it?

Clearly, need (SAFELY) get streets DEMAND government take seriously. already LATE?? know, ELSE going do? watch numbers go exponentially every day? Wait breakdown food chain/law order?  give Covid-19 ideas pls also secured manufacturing facilities US, India Brazil.

Another deal Japan way. Physical health fine. Mental health poor, likely triggered shingles early age. medical conditions aside chiari malformation mostly asymptomatic time. NY peaked like 11k cases day. took three months get numbers mask compliant state. would guess takes longer newly effected states get numbers down. they'll worse effected even lower peak numbers compared ny. point is: fucking travel states. cannot legally bar it, hit sorts consequences do. zerohedge.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Respectfully,
Not Ashley Smith Re-opening protests rural towns flouting mask usage social distancing...  tests per capita? getting data from? shows otherwise. saying wrong googled this. Let start saying fully agree premise sub support sub itself. 


 know I'll get downvotes this, I'm really getting sick spamming hell every post. comments even real low effort say much link sub something like ""agree"" link. 

There way promote sub tactfully spamming. chose latter. money truly fungible, used bailout funds share buybacks bailed out. We‚Äôre fuuuuuucked went give blood. thermal head scan enter. wanted remove mask take temp tongue sitting 1-2 feet someone apparently day strangers indoors. walked out. See vax redcross. Also, employees social distance other, one taking blood right next donor nose exposed. Maybe big deal some, me, I'm going test good deed goes unpunished. I‚Äôm Upstate NY although county 200 people die didn‚Äôt leave houses 8 weeks starting March even started going get haircuts things again...

For think 2-3 week event...in State (and NY state huge rural area) semi lockdown months yet. Perhaps ACE2 receptor, people conditions ACE2 receptors much numerous others. That‚Äôs matter pinion. called drinking home 

That's did. quite fun that's life testing people JFC That's interesting question first time people pissed cops killing unarmed black man. first time history millions people able march protest killings consistent basis without eventually go back work. think thousands people walking near one another, outside, significant portion wear masks contributing current spike? Undoubtedly. contributing. big contribution speculated about, probably actually known decade study fact. think different, equally important scenario one complete lack Federal leadership resulted series events millions people work due global pandemic resulting catastrophic death toll within country seen last 100 years. country dumpster fire. protests cause fire. symptom it. work medical field. treat cause. symptom. government ignored cause, active participant it. Newsom needs roll back state's reopening GOOD. spend 8 weeks mostly home, mentally going shit, neighbors, etc. end dying hospitals overrun COVID anyway! constitutional rights. 

/s  classic tactic. Point finger, blame other. ran list. First Chinese. virus took root communities, Hispanic workers fault. Now, millennials. This. even know everything virus yet, know long term effects all, yet people want wear mask, something sooooo simple do. I'd rather family think I'm crazy going mall parties end sick, dead, tons medical debt. 9,585 new cases
THATS NUMBERWANG, LET'S ROTATE BOARD life/health like shingles? I‚Äôve got friends vacationing Florida Michigan, plus saw pictures wedding happened today bunch people church. showing it, spending money saving. 2 months they're evicted starving, sure remind grasshopper ant. Good. you‚Äôre afraid, don‚Äôt go. That‚Äôs Yep. Personality disorders shades. people grow motivated. ...you thought couldn‚Äôt cross state lines? feel bad. 

Anybody blames happened fool. Unfortunately think stupid along. It‚Äôs getting louder. Hmm, connective tissue disorder, damage autonomic nervous system... ehlers danlos syndrome? POTS girls dysautonomia support group used go ehlers danlos. That's learned it. weird long term effects coronavirus sooo much common POTS ehlers danlos, since seem like would completely unrelated. Temperature weirdness, extreme fatigue, dizziness, tachycardia, feeling drunk, brain fog, muscle pain... would never associate respiratory illness. autonomic nervous system takes even light beating, hell breaks loose. wish best, little zebra friend. confirm this. People restaurant job keep disappearing weeks coming back looking like shit. won‚Äôt show one day management acts like idea why. almost done degree honestly contemplating taking extra loans cover rent last couple semesters instead working high exposure rest pandemic serve guy fries. 

Also: ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù returned work, except openly racist given current events. It‚Äôs even worse before. axe!

Mother's Day party. horrible passed away. least time post warning family gatherings. Sad. sad. Add Madison WI list airports? There's much focus airlines, think much spreading taking place standing security lines, ticket lines, around baggage carousels. mention tram/train/bus takes terminal, Don‚Äôt forget churches / choirs unless martial law declared; that's gonna choice made also. I'm hoping bloodshed, things turn really ugly. Damn near every major city US major protests. HORSESHIT I‚Äôd say clients hope before. I‚Äôm also thinking vary demographically. never made statement never defended that. making argument claims never made.

My original comment all. chose respond own. people besides sub original comment prompted numerous remarks I‚Äôve seen them. know may hard, please try self centered.  Ok. want white people die basically? mean, I‚Äôm sure else interpret word salad.

You need take break Reddit, friend. stress good you. I‚Äôm sarcastic. Driving home downtown Miami beach 10pm absolutely packed people good time. wearing masks many weren‚Äôt, people ghosting cars doors open. Girls drunk twerking everywhere it‚Äôs like normal summer miami. going get bad Well really little column little column B.

There people callous happens anyone themselves. can't fix that. 

You also people believe ""God"" protect faithful something. can't fix stupid either.

We rolled together pandemic. next months going lots fun. course effect. think places low effect, places large effect. Probably depends dense many people actually wearing mask. places I'm sure better others. Also NYC they've already gone shit, places like going effected much. 
And anyone truly believes effect pro open everything outdoors back up. Parades, concerts, sports, food festivals, Disney, everything. long mask usage density protests 100 percent it. Kind late protests riots going weeks. urge alligators go vegan. urge laws physics cease. think that's less true couple months ago. mention died result ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù became world pandemic. Due protests... sad really hope population ignorant Americans remove them. SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë1 also killed 9% tested positive. 50% 60 older.

It quite different SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2. Mid 1770s possible? possible got many results back day tests performed? Upstate we're still told labs taking long time give results, hence numbers rising recovering quickly. Clinton County's ""probable"" category mess includes pending tests positive antibody results. report additions new confirmed positives, they're already recovered.... numbers make sense. Anyway, get point, Clinton County's Health Dept posted Facebook page: ""Some labs taking particularly long time report results. something control over, sometimes affect cases reported you, soon see individuals moved recovered category.""


Does mean labs reporting county right away labs processing tests right away? Either way, believe tests given yesterday processed reported correct agencies. Something reported correctly, know what. people want rationalize justify every action personally favor. want admit actions, even well intentioned, adverse consequences, makes difficult/ complicated rationalize support pre- existing preference. people like changing beliefs. dismiss new facts evidence create tension nuance. watching rioters Hollywood Last night

People US huge issue putting cloth mouth, good luck injecting something don‚Äôt understand. death levels increase infection rates, funerals longer allowed.

This makes sense.

Doing things Sweden plus making tests plus made lockdown get numbers way less sustanable Sweden doing.

There parameter could make sustainable. 

Doing lockdown FREES ressources. makes possible open stuff, let people move around freely, let people go normally hospital without fear infected, makes countries open borders etc. sustainable. reporting many early? Happily understanding Western Australia ""lock down"" heavily enforce physical distancing combined test, trace isolate hotel quarantine.

Last case community spread April 23. Borders remain closed economy fully open restrictions.

Ask Anders Tegnell Sweden's economy many people die every day? News in: AIDS cancer spallpox leprosy flu. Great Job Italy! NYC seeing 8k+ cases Florida 40k+ cases US new norm. ever going get first wave? Lol. Total selfishness. Whats current hospitalizion data? Florida stats this? Score 3 natural selection.. shocked someone common sense schools reopening, finally. Americans Westerners want accept fact risks equal. ""hurr durr people protest, can't can't go bar?"" bar *indoors*, numbskull, plus wear mask drink time? ReOPen protests cause spikes, would protest people actually taking precautions cause any? People going beaches, cause huge spikes either. no, people testing positive spike, that's nature virus there's vaccine. people, people countries actually put work in, say ""We learn live virus,"" that's mean. mean live cases constantly rising every day huge amounts deaths, Americans addicted struggle.

They're addicted struggling yet Americans--the institutions, corporations, people--are lazy, swear Christ, want try anything that's new different days. want adapt that's country falling apart continue falling apart. falling apart fine without pandemic, although people want admit it, SARS II accelerated everything. Yeah. wasn‚Äôt BLM protest Houston (was one? don‚Äôt know specifically) filled ICU beds. wasn‚Äôt compassion solidarity Florida peaking. Arizona.  Key distancing yourself.

Since nobody likes guy spreading plague whatever, sick supposed stay home, state takes care wage.

Clinical trials though may needed. there's people left? US practice social distancing? 
Just look Reddit. many threads importance social distancing compared importance wearing masks? many shops restaurants reject people observe social distancing compared wearing masks?

All scientists agree works lockdowns, social distancing masks. order. lockdowns option, focus social distancing. situations social distancing possible, use mask.
That order Europe, Australia Asia focusing works. virus spreading spiking, contrary dropping even though schools, restaurants, gyms, shops etc. open month. 

What US do? Ignores list except number 3 expect get result. shit spread virus increase. surprise all, American reaction masks give desired effect, focus even masks. add beds.

But can‚Äôt add doctors nurses... Looks like I'll drain bank account another 4 months... effective teachers. vaccine population skeptical safety much larger vulnerability risk

I mean normally vaccines. got hepatitis vaccines pocket. administration lied protective masks conserve supply. know lie fail mention serious health effects vaccine fits public health initiative? know mask debacle can't trust public health authorities. tell see wearing masks coming send sidewalk. masks work?

By way, Facebook proof. Bet going show stuff anti-mask Facebook group.
You honestly sound like person refuses wear masks stores. southeast Florida tell saw live meeting area tv week healthcare official announced empty icu beds locally. Last heard, statewide 25% hospitals beds empty- that‚Äôs much, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going get worse week next. Hopefully closure bars help, it‚Äôs bizarre many people living life acting like nothing even happening. god forbid put mask faces! UK wear mask wearing minimal there‚Äôs association spread spikes large outside gatherings / protests / packed beaches / raves etc

It appears outside means risk spreading vastly reduced. two different proposed plans per article. One refunds everything, 4k (8k couple) different, travel America one refunds half. Also one option ""some.""

So required wear mask doctor Costco never required... touch head scans total shit.

I also remember one instance people leave notes car parked handicap spots. would see tag looked normal got car, would assume abusing leave nasty-grams taking handicap spot ""doesn't need it."" 

And course also nobody believes symptoms general. first big attack, lot symptoms doctors brushed attributed getting older. Going North Central Florida feels like opposite. would great time invent antibiotics make fortune think we're past turning around soon.

This type disaster one society least equipped deal with. 
We decide attend outdoor family get together week ago would late siblings 50th. Brought chairs, food, masks, gloves ourselves. Someone belittled wearing mask, claiming ‚Äòeveryone‚Äôs going get it, what‚Äôs big deal?‚Äô. 
The unfortunate thing we‚Äôre team fed us vs mentality. I‚Äôm angry guy telling I‚Äôm stupid wearing mask, I‚Äôm sad become political issue. 
It‚Äôs hard watch disaster unfold try remind do. wear mask gloves take care family ask elderly neighbors help anything. You‚Äôre right thing too, keep up. Counter productive would mean made things worse.

Someone else's mask first line defense. catch Covid19, came someone else's lungs.

Currently many people without masks, 100% unfiltered inhaled exhaled. mask better nothing.

But filtration. barrier slows, traps, deflects air moisture exhaled. 

Low filtration leaks, majority exhaled breath slowed deflected face (warm mask), glasses (foggy glasses), hair clothes, still way better coughing spewing unfiltered unblocked everything everyone public. Swedenbros past months decisively changed opinion country worse. natural progression. I'm pretty sure idiots currently refusing wear masks nothing military scientists invented internet 40 years ago. Meanwhile America... ""Daddy, restaurants?"" unrelated question you. keep seeing posts medical personnel about, like said, ""code,"" people ""coded."" mean? chances stupid half America anything anyone else altruism? googolplex one.

B.S!‚Äù spread virus effected many factors. 
Social distancing 1m indoors wind similar factors effect wearing N95 mask right next infected person.

I think safe say observing social distance 10-20 outdoors next water, even sea breeze, lowers risks considerably compared standing 1 infected person indoors. Agreed. Tomorrow could 5-7k. Tuesday's reported numbers might one breaks 10k *meant* slip puddle. Hihihi... forget mention tactics already people died... end.. period... more...

Everyone sick = one show work = business grind hault.

Total Bill far $0 lots mutations limited number rhinovirus species, like lots mutations limited number coronavirus species. litterally exactly thing. Every fucking restaurant takeout, including places nice never allowed takeouts doggy bags. ass?  Agreed, kind need decide whether want 100% safety 90%+. I'm ok 6 feet without mask people trust take Covid seriously. I'm youngish low affected area. realize still risk, I'm ok that. I'd understand others aren't. Look now. horrific. People, please wear masks. 

Please care fellow human. Wedgy world giving coronavirus fatigue etc. flu, times. first time knocked couple months second time less severe. really struck said ‚Äúesp. you‚Äôre woman‚Äù nobody took symptoms seriously. It‚Äôs like anything really it‚Äôd nice believed. understand coronavirus cause cytokine storm putting immune system overdrive, simultaneously cause depletion immune cells. way properly trace even get infected. asymptomatic, since protestors young, likely affected enough suspicious. carry home circles homes, spreads someone high risk.

That works, poor tracing can't account it. mean claim children... behave? kind role model set? casino owners profits :( typical response I'm going argue against.

They full force. want us fight other. trying attack US make citizens hate already do. might wrong sometimes think someone paid foreign influencer important remain vigilant. can't let stupid trolls unravel have.  using tests dead people. That's case Delhi least. .00001% chance worth you? kinda pointless cuz odds lot worse still. face kind risk every day getting car? long would put life hold .00001% chance dying? Anxiety one ‚Äúreal‚Äù feelings is. Especially describe able get full breath. take year college actually thought dying, even though like 40 tests everything imaginable came back negative.

Can‚Äôt even imagine feeling would symptoms COVID, potentially deadly disease going around exact symptoms. 

I think there‚Äôs going somewhat mental health crisis next years, people continue breathing difficulties thinking it‚Äôs long term COVID symptoms. addition actually long term COVID symptoms. Bunch cockwomble coneheads.... Maybe put state-of-the-art sports facility hold America likes windows closed. ever tried reason school aged kid? literally comes back original point, people stupid. 

Science matters now, people dying something could prevented. give fuck mild inconvenience, want wear mask to. go ahead stay ass home watch news. 

I'm tired never ending pandemic people stupid put aside idiotic rhetoric show slightest bit giving fuck people. dont care america, live europe. country able control virus.

Everybody knows american gov incompetent POTUS idiot.

But doesnt change fact china tried hide virus first place. think guy recorded exactly why... understand saying. countries get again. 
Either stay permanent home quarantine end getting again

Italy immune now. Someone crosses border spreads again. Maybe I'm naive, read something like ""Oregon 130 ICU beds available,"" mentally substitute ""Oregon handle additional 130 ICU patients."" words, 130 ICU beds available staffed, drugs available, power hospital, etc.

And actually serious question: wrong? mean 130 beds unoccupied various ICU departments throughout Oregon, might functionally usable? think poll lot liars, may also likely see people wearing masks public people wear masks staying home often too.

I bet there's high correlation wearing mask whenever go going often. Personal experience- I‚Äôve never healthy since started taking vitamin (severe deficiency lab test) Worked ED nurse 20 years, plenty time ‚Äúexpose‚Äù immune system lots bugs. Used get upper respiratory infections, sore throats, sinus issues, cold sx regular, like least 1-2x per month winter. 

Since corrected vitamin I‚Äôve sick avg 2-3 times entire fall/winter. Little downside taking it, it‚Äôs cheap. think might issue ask PCP check Vit level Evangelicals US believe vaccine leave ""mark beast""- literal mark people must show order buy sell goods. also anti-maskers screeching required wear mask stores, claim masks ""mark beast"". take book Revelations, prophesies Bible end days. adios pantalones! casinos gambling employees life.

Jesus I‚Äôm one. don‚Äôt trust fast tracked vaccine.  Italy end pandemic, US middle it. look forward change leadership come November hold. Wearing mask restaurant weird. Oh god, never thought way. Makes awful sort sense. Korea

South Korea, much like Japan, Taiwan, Sweden, technically never lockdown instead opted less draconian methods, highly successful.

I sure USA quick recover bad situation social distancing masks.

We long lockdown introduced masks social distancing trend good worked quite well. back normal (limited capacity bars, clubs still close .... ) still almost normal life numbers good till now.

It fun, sure worked know that. know masks work now. Maybe better USA use lesson learned New York Europe close everything weeks reopen masks social distancing mandatory. quickest way economy recover least planning. 

What spend weeks mandatory masks discover number stay still high? first try method.

Personally go outside join protest. pregnant would unsafe me. fully support anyone protested masks. 

I know white woman think right tell black people wait little longer rights... little longer. know seeing loved ones gunned streets little patient please figure pandemic. Nope. 

 least US history continually requiring asking much patience Black people. got even know word patience quite sick they've expected deal with.

Also, talk youth behind mean youth? lots generations involved protests. Although many might twenties early thirties grown adults know add know risks. 

At point think movement mobilized moving towards figuring change laws institutions although people still protesting really think shifted. far people meeting super large gatherings might past phase little while. is, another person killed questionable way. 

Anyway, cautious could totally think movement valid one ven spread. tomorrow caught Corona virus due spread say one doctors went protests would angry. worthy cause cannot say life worth minorities fighting lives.

But argument stool infectious it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs reason primary way detecting virus NP swab stool sample. 

I‚Äôll listen infectious disease experts I‚Äôve worked 10 years Reddit med students.

Just read something book internet regurgitate Reddit doesn‚Äôt make smart. makes look like asshole.

Dipende dal nucleo familiare tipo 200-250 fissi pi√π un tot per ogni membro sopra al 3 Haha, wish could say crazy, us. embarrassed this.

Interacting clients, one one, close proximity easily hour time. 

After work, time mask another 2-3 hours helping elderly woman share property that's 5 day work schedule. everyday.

The people deal pain-in-the-ass wearing mask gets while, faster stop.  Instead getting pissed angry people refusing wear them, clearly do, maybe direct anger ones don't, ensuring we'll wearing masks lot longer needed to. experience, people masks urban areas rural ones. I‚Äôd estimate 20% wear masks urban areas 10% rural areas (just I‚Äôve seen firsthand). Yep. Hopefully get competent people eventually Texan, regretfully agree. Many friends loved ones misled proudly irresponsible. like stuck panic room, except danger. Protect Rona finishes making point... pray household. went Home Depot SFV two days ago get supplies Covid-inspired handywork, know, stuff I‚Äôve meaning fix years always pushed off. people wearing masks 20% people weren‚Äôt even enough make store unsafe environment. Many workers couldn‚Äôt bothered wear masks either. People don‚Äôt appreciate infectious that, we‚Äôre totally fucked.

Whenever possibility virus GM comes gets shunned almost immediately like voted. American works travel. travel (at least leisure) allowed EU, July 1 open, places good control covid. US list.

We're going find happens outbreak goes mostly unmitigated densely populated areas. still peak tail like outbreaks high peak gets bit frightening think guess understand meant True dat. Certain factions US heavily politicized science. is, turn, causing massive rise deaths denying dismissing science scientist seen merely patriotic, ""cool"". ^this 2020 version asking toast bread line. sorry free flight interrupted deaths long term illnesses millions people

Typical selfish American polishing turd. whole ""democratic"" system US needs complete do-over.

Get rid Electoral College, remove requirement voter registration, find another solution first-past-the-post, let convicts keep voting rights. Prisoners able vote prison. become political Drumph think big deal. downplays virus showing concern puts ""the side"" US incredibly polarized right now. I‚Äôve seen small undercurrent people saying black men wearing light blue masks somehow make look threatening police

Granted probably one worst excuses I‚Äôve heard wearing mask far (seriously light blue mask connotation whatsoever) people believe that's response, even bother it? 

It in-depth see cumulative number hospitalized patients rising 150-200 every day weeks now. wrong. Businesses everywhere like manufacturing stopped least month sobs SC.... Ah, yes. 

Why we, population 320 million, unite like New Zealand, population 5 million?

It truly boggles mind could possibly fail unify. Deaths reported Sundays always low. put things prospective, AZ's deaths counts past 6 Sundays were: 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, respectively. significant increase sure. Texas embarrassing. Showing world run xxxxxx‚Äôs percentage restaurant owners better. 

Profits People - That‚Äôs Texas way. It‚Äôs goFundme racket ever saw one. Guy denies covid, get sick, goes hospital, family post goFundme, come home, rinse repeat. German friends don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs huge deal either (this SoCal). accustomed visiting family Germany times year...should definitely wake call. honestly believe too. Americans fat, dumb, entitled Quick defect, distract. seeing see Sir, Wendy‚Äôs. pretty sure that's begin Ok many 80% wearing mask correctly? see many people wear mouth, take talk people. see lot chin masks well. you‚Äôre young healthy it. don‚Äôt sneeze grandmas soon. cause large breakouts, could hundreds thousands. small number people brought USA didn‚Äôt die, look death pyramid them. Hahahahahaha Better first sick, yes. Better sick? No. Hemochromatosis. surprised numbers. travelled outside Ft. Wayne, since March. observation fewer 20% people see supermarket, etc wear masks. also berated twice past two weeks wearing one - Uber driver Avis car rental. Well unless you‚Äôre at-risk group elderly, won‚Äôt first get it. roll hospital workers, military, vulnerable first. answer question Chinese.

Do want mass infection, 10 weeks enforced confinement everyone home?

In fact everyone knows unforced closures useless, long 10% get out, remaining 90% wasted.

In Wuhan, close 100% people community closed doors, necessities life, medicine purchased community workers, 20 community workers responsible 200,000 people related matters, many people work overtime every day 6-8 hours.

I know community worker registered admitted cases community, grandfather enter hospital worse condition, friend finally found bed got friend shout social media.

Wuhan's closure first step ensure spread areas large scale, mandatory closure community, mandatory masks, mandatory private cars road, temperature testing places, necessities life, medicine community centralized procurement, mandatory centralized isolation confirmed patients, suspected patients, patients fever rule possibility infection close contacts confirmed patients, establishment 2,000-person field hospital, requisition sports stadiums build 50,000 people admit patients minor illnesses, series measures break chain transmission.

Wuhan able turn new zero nowhere, look Italy, worst can't force people stay homes, fine people forcing way public areas, that's Italy accumulated 230,000 cases well.

The people Wuhan made huge sacrifices economy, Beijing well, Xinfadi market destroyed hundreds thousands tons vegetables meat, merchants scream social media sites knew safety many people, including families.

Your definition victory matter opinion alone. thing many months ago. 

Not surprised &amp; frankly don‚Äôt really care much. monetary lubricant exchange, liquidity, siphoned easily afford faucets hoses. Wall Street pump. Yes, amazing. mean someone 40, unplanned hospital visit high chance lead long term medical issues. sure people would think would different.

And worse, effective treatments. thing needs remembered acknowledged.

If worried exposure, go damn restaurant all. Canada allowing that? It‚Äôs America‚Äôs problem land route Alaska goes Canada. US citizens want go 48 Alaska find way, Canada. Correct! isnt skeptical good thing?

This interesting question, surface, course is. But, then, skeptical about, grounds? sceptical leading scientists field, trained in, feels wrong you, watched Youtube video? much. scepticism, different kind religion. worshipping ignorance, scepticism. many people get scientists sceptical critical other. all.  agree parts like that. lot South absolutely like that.  idea indoor dining safe right delusion.

Free housing, free food, free utilities, free testings. isn‚Äôt, areas positions aren‚Äôt competitive Good point. Probably glee pity. seriously ignorant questions covid meat processing facilities. 

are covid cases introduced workers, arrival (is possible?) contaminated meat?

im assuming meat cold plants.  virus get transported live meat makes way around facility?

in normal cold/flu season dozens workers fall ill yearly? Can't stop signal, Mal. small percentage totally honest Went little drive last night (no stops). fireworks stores across SC border **jam packed**. Vehicles grass, lines door, zero distancing. Crappy little bar never busy all, beyond capacity. way testing catch what's coming. worst case scenario happens hospitals overwhelmed.

Worst case would include things like essential workers going work either sick afraid getting infected.

What happens country essential workers go work? I'm European, relate that. Many people afraid government well. Guaranteed it'll get pushback. venn diagram anti-vaxx anti mask overlap probably think. South Carolinian here. Reverse numbers would us! Send help! No, worthless information. means nothing. Ignore vaccine news unless it‚Äôs phase 3 results I‚Äôm terrified us I‚Äôm New Jersey.

Maybe gf‚Äôs country something like too? I'm going continue arguing beautiful Sunday. hope less ppl die. Sorry fit narrative. good Thanks. genuinely appreciate sympathy. willfull ignorance really tough fathom. still see today (Actually looked days ago) . 20 articles main page, one Covid related, stuffed middle list, briefly mentioning Florida uptick cases. info states record new cases, commentary might occurring. / cue family rich white Karens screeching learning So, it‚Äôs unnatural understand need sacrifice little one‚Äôs convenience preserve lives collective populace?

That actually sounds like someone listening nature would do. 

What seeing America nurtured attitude self-service entitlement, coupled systemic under-education deep misunderstanding science works.

It‚Äôs nature NGAF fellow human. LDR 8 years without meeting... yeah Quite bad yes Sorry sued endangering citizens? Username checks flu. Yeah, sure this. Good thought definitely seems like projecting want answer be.

With 330 million people 90 million people there's still 240 million possible candidates. 

You could right speaking absolutes really supported data yet. qualms saying that's opinion though. ‚ÄúMay have?‚Äù know like 10 Fox fanatics personally hoax get Biden elected. EU, Europe. even saying people definitely wear masks point? Last checked still 'do feel' mode. Dude, advocating protect pedos. pedo.

Please go away. I'm blocking you. worth anyone else's time. amended assessment, said Swedish contagion rates fact ‚Äústable.‚Äù linked high number cases increase testing. 

Yeah no... that's said. said number cases reported higher due increased testing ""but important thing note"" number positive tests remaining stable, suggesting many people infected previous testing regime exposing.

In words, way know rate infection changed time, note much higher previously suggested. Yep. mean look what‚Äôs already happened coronavirus - swine flu, mad cow disease... It‚Äôd solid start sure. Again, fortunate much bring job, sales seldom reflect much take (I‚Äôve day made sales even), lot regulars consider family. said- that‚Äôs I‚Äôm sick job going back school too. quarantine many regulars mine (one particular struck nerve 85-year-old regular mine who‚Äôs RESPIRATOR) asking reopen I‚Äôve I‚Äôve safe entire time, I‚Äôm DONE ever, every tip get people know thinking pay friend.

For it‚Äôs money anymore, I‚Äôm looking anything health benefits lower pay point. speaking terms lot servers would leave industry weren‚Äôt tip system place. Especially considering servers take lot cash don‚Äôt report. Netherlands practically nobody wears mask outside public transport required healthcare professionals. 

Here Reddit sometimes get feeling people think masks important seeing relatively good virus now, apparently they're small part solution. feed crocodile? girlfriend Hungaria (where lives) Vienna, [she got needed send photo everyday cops come round 2 3 times day. agree principle reddit best place facts. American I'll say this. fiance' stay away people, wear masks. CONSTANTLY battle people ( mean like legit almost leading fist fights ) get people back fu** up! one people need travel ALSO fall CATEGORY. ZERO pity. brought upon us all. 

Stop breathing unknown peoples necks. They‚Äôre still coming in. Claiming travelling Alaska vacationing instead. Never said intellectually superior ?

But ahead twist words like everything else internet. Go ahead, know i‚Äôm illusion mind. helps come terms yourself, go ahead perceive something never said. That‚Äôs fair invade Canada would need ban travel Peru country letting 99% people out? They're playing long game. die Covid, they'll retake Texas California.

Biden rape someone? U.S. major country cases still skyrocketing like this. No, all.

You attracted children, pedo. Go away. Technically Canada still allowing dual citizens recently.  I‚Äôve completely lost track days. fuck ton labs don‚Äôt report weekends general. Well probably see backlog Tuesday slightly accurate. week going pretty telling terms deaths look like new surges. Surely investigation one bring down! :: Picture Nelson pointing America:: ""Ha-ha""... Congrats, many people arent dont want be. America continent. Educate yourself. make permanent?  obvious? prove residency and/or employment status order allowed across border.  state everything control near zero risk. wear masks appropriate follow governors recommendations, health department deemed acceptable. 

No need cunt it.  saw car Nevada plates Victoria day... Depends eventual vaccine. Two three styles using decades old delivery platforms. They've proven safe. new antigen payload. passing initial trials fairly certain safe.

There whole new vaccine delivery method also tested...I signing one Day 1.

I hope tried tested ones ones win people feel confident getting it. Fourty-three nine-elevens four months. haven‚Äôt....in Minnesota they‚Äôve gone up. Go Hong Kong üá≠üá∞  immunity transient non-existent think would seen thousands cases person got mild case, tested positive, severe case recovering testing positive. thousands cases antibodies detected patient later got sick, I‚Äôm ready get country. divided racially, politically, even turn fucking virus political argument. I‚Äôm getting soon afford to. 100% wear - Boston Even .00001% chance death isn‚Äôt worth it, opinion. severe heart condition requires pacemaker. odds worse. less it‚Äôs spread, less chance dying. 

But guess since don‚Äôt care me....well, ain‚Äôt shit stay home much possible. non-selfish responsible American, say is: ‚ÄúAs should.‚Äù Yeah. There's moderation. feel like us already knew that, need shown yet again... Deaths growing exponentially Italy United States months now. would mean might well it. 

Bullshit. still 20% safer, regardless live day day life. There'd chance simply cannot catch it, 20% reduction capable spreading you. 20% able spread anybody else, fewer non-immune others able spread you. R0 would significantly decline. safer. Unemployment would drop. win-win, exclusionary better vaccine appearing. Cool. Thanks dick Americans want nothing trump. comments getting removed political. idea why. see reply comment history. get downvoted well comment dumb shit medical terminology, symptom patient feel notice themself. article better preventing spread Covid-19 , article Covid19 deniers use proof masks useless. roofers take insane risks shit roofers. USA think OSHA created reason. kid's school bus packed 70 kids. way things going go back way were. Yep, study pass bullshit test. Awhile ago, crowds much smaller one protesting lock downs outside. Granted, age demographics different many wearing masks, think \~70 cases traced states alone. BLM protests significantly people carried course weeks. number people wearing masks, still lot people not: ""no link."" Sure, whatever say. No. say thing happen guns mean skeletal framework place gun owner doesn‚Äôt violate someone else‚Äôs rights.

And always nukes, goddamn. Everytime. embarrassing testing anyone awhile. they‚Äôre running tests guess go back testing symptomatic people I'm concerned UK (ok, Boris Johnson) decide sucking Trump therefore letting people USA important keeping virus here. Thank pointing useful information. 

You mentioned numbers ‚Äúescalating quickly‚Äù taking look death #‚Äôs day, I‚Äôm seeing mild spike early June compared large spike see cases time frame, - would imply death rate remaining relatively constant even decreasing it‚Äôs probably mostly younger people becoming infected. scenario true hospitalization rate well.

What‚Äôs concerning see hospital bed usage. steady increase AZ since April, seems moderate increase 5-10 percent bed usage spike. end , able hold ICU capacity keep death rate stable even decreasing even reopen, case counts even much issue? keeping eye these. work employees would cover nose, mouth mask. I've seen far many employees stores ""wearing"" masks. Sure spent lot energy arguing lol. It‚Äôs open fucking forum mate, didn‚Äôt respond all. could easily block me. Same, Upstate South Carolina. random twitter post isn‚Äôt proof fool.
It‚Äôs 6 feet that‚Äôs preferred distance stay prevent getting close contracting disease spreading it. 
What exactly mean ‚Äútelevision doctors?‚Äù I‚Äôm following safety guidelines don‚Äôt want get deadly virus.
There‚Äôs ‚Äúcure covid‚Äù
But vaccines probably available year. best thing social distance wear mask stay safe. non-selfish responsible American, say ‚ÄúAs should.‚Äù social pressure wear mask places ridiculous.

[i got downvoted talked (though maybe people like saying US like countries people poop street). 

i think people really idea like conservative area. many people respect masks either wear them, wear infrequently, wear take talk people. wondering thing. see positive outweigh must also see negative handling biggest crisis America seen since Great Depression. Bexar County almost 1000 cases yesterday. Everyone talks Houston dallas Austin going drowning soon one cares Interesting, thanks. US playing Whac-a-Mole failing.  person replied specifically referenced Millenials Boomers everyone else ""others."" thought would self-explanatory talking Zoomers mentioned barely able vote... need expound Millennials since already covered previously. pretty hard hide fuckup American proportions. end year racked hundreds thousands completely preventable deaths utter negligence administration stupidity among general population. everything needed contain it, didn't. China obvious things.

Only Brazil done worse US, that's mostly seem dead set beating high score. I'm talking face shields like hood. idiocy one illnesses? 
 
That's masks work. rather take chance killing worker(s) end life long disabilities Karen Chad double cheeseburger? mean, unless staff n95 masks, eye protection, anything else really prevents infection. would okay that.
  Honestly, understand people need money, better way. Even protect staff, customers wide open. Maybe outdoor dining might alleviate it, rare cases might get infection. Dine though sounds like nightmare.  Yeah, agree you. hope strength fact international effort, competition breed robust criticism end result best possible. US declares vaccine safe country does, it‚Äôs pretty clear bias vice versa.


On subject safety, vaccine 100% safe... it‚Äôs significantly safe virus it‚Äôs still worth considering, me. would rather best 2 options even one isn‚Äôt perfect. Actually sars2 test accuracy pretty good, antibody testing needs improvement. Testing live virus give false negatives (say poor sampling technique).

Whether virus escaped prisoner lab great conspiracy theories immaterial getting world free disease.

Skimmed hammer dance sure trying say now. don‚Äôt think people lied poll, fibbed maybe, definitely wasn‚Äôt seen opportunity taken mask eye rollers. take home packet comment valid. know teachers great packets (for internet students) extended learning, critical reading/thinking skills, taught new vocabulary, yelled much work vice versa enough work. Looking back, teachers/students/parents best could, others may taken advantage situation. could tell plenty positive negative stories lol. 

The diy thing. majority students sleeping 11:00 turning assigned work well night. one going anywhere. Typical meetings, parties, going places, entertainment canceled. People stuff home. Everyones‚Äô schedules off. absolutely way we‚Äôll end pandemic vaccine fall. Assuming get several good vaccines past phase 3 trials September like we‚Äôre hoping, still likely take year distribute world.

Vulnerable people, Frontline medical workers, first responders, military government officials, essential workers get vaccine first. Oh, celebrities rich people. Stop spreading lies, definitely happen. banned You‚Äôre like... cool. hope applied cares act assistance college 

That could 6000 grand assistance free Tenerife, Treblinka, Tom Arnold adults it. expect kids it? vaccine/treatments fall? chance.

Fall/winter horrific. Red cross indeed sell blood. It‚Äôs good many people infected? Incorrect. I'm familiar publishing industry thing probably something similar happened within wrestling industry earlier week right glorious whenever comes around Maybe read link instead mashing caps lock. still possible protests may caused increase spread virus among attended protests, according report. 

Also reason isnt spike everywhere people stayed inside protests riots curfews- findings suggest direct decrease social distancing among subset population participating protests offset increasing social distancing behavior among others may choose shelter-at-home circumvent public places protests underway,"" report reads. 

Also- California, 35% confirmed cases recorded past two weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom said news conference Monday. decision point. US enough get virus control. coming back bite them... bigger issue sue bar. would sue shit them. Obviously follow guidelines. Yes, chose go 60 people got Rona pretty obvious business operating outside bounds health depts guidelines allowed it. Yeah... would discussion we're having.

Your country blasting daily new cases record every week lmao.

And that's *reduced* testing. Good god knows bad *actually* is. not? thought issues last election, too. 

I could well wrong though. Well right, personally kinda include Vietnam, plus there's million include list sadly long Seeing +/- 20% food US imported (seafood almost 80% imported), import goods Europe sell (including pharmaceuticals), Europe even hit top 10 places get foreign aid, fair say need Europe need us. Mask Black King Bar magically repel 100% magical virus.

Well goes non-existent travel plans. says theyre making exceptions deemed essential employees.

I'd assume surplus deaths maybe quarter they're published? genuinely take years? things more... thanks proving point I‚Äôll getting nothing additional value moving Europe.

(Looking forward brash misinformed response) seems lot conflicting information/data spread kids. Asking legit questions troll? Yikes ridiculous idea. Ummm no, US country weirdly controversial. Plenty countries way better mask usage US. Look video Beijing, notice anything every person it? 
China mask wearing part general everyday culture years. lots countries require mask usage due pandemic. Lmaooo. Obviously not.

Here's excerpt another recent article coronavirus symptoms typically resolve two three weeks, estimated 1 10 experience prolonged symptoms, Dr. Helen Salisbury University Oxford wrote British Medical Journal previously ran 5k three times week feel breathless single flight stairs, cough incessantly exhausted return work, fear may never regain previous health real,‚Äù wrote.

Too many people think long die covid, nothing worry about. favorite, ""I'm young healthy, one bad cold hurt me"". whole lot evidence significant percentage people mild cases, even asymptomatic, long term and/or irreparable damage.

There's one doctor, specializes scuba diving certifications safety professional divers. found quite number healthy, active divers examined who, covid, lung damage looks like permanent, prevent diving permanently.

The reason found specialization, need lung scans diving certifications. Otherwise, would gone undocumented. Imagine people overwhelmed medical systems treated mild covid, feeling exhausted flight stairs, doctors tell ""some people take longer recover"".

It take years even reasonable estimate extent damage done covid. are, US lead Morons parade . Shingles great example, almost everyone chicken pox kid.

No telling covid might recovered people immune system weakens Dude, dinosaurs. think birds are? easily hit 1M without course correction. US could easily add another 150-300k deaths, since we‚Äôre apparently hell bent recreating NYC Florida, Arizona, Texas, etc Also come stats. care less 100% cases U.S. I'm concerned fear mongering happens country pretty much others. ""Fear people think way do. Fear virus killing people, may never recover. Fear self driving cars robots take over. Fear police they'll shoot you."" going stop nonsense?

The states entering crisis BIG states. large populations vulnerable populations. FL AZ largest populations elderly.  NY got lots coverage due efforts Governor total number people involved. FL zoomed them. prediction lose half 75+ population attitudes going change. going change lot things. see two months.

Burying dead may bar financial protections NY, going somewhere work won‚Äôt. Mass transit safe wear full face n100 respirator. saw like two months ago facebook page. laughed ass hard. shit stand trial, people harassing small business access big fat lawyers. social distancing outside pointless then?

If hundreds thousands people chanting side side didn‚Äôt cause spike, tell people social distance outside? common cold form one three species rhinovirus mutated 160 different human viruses.

Where getting terrible information? common cold composed Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, Influenza Viruses Adenoviruses. Safe far clinical trials, still long long way go. Florida hospital here.

We beautiful, elegant, really good COVID-19 plan. worked extremely well since March hospital feeling extremely proud good exposure rates survival rates were. plan allowed us good safe hospital employees patients.

We COVID-19 floor elevator. created multiple waiting rooms grouping illness separately trauma (a separate space high risk factors). social distancing measures waiting rooms prevented people doubling up. first floor bathrooms became single use bathrooms ticketing system. even modified cafeteria processes focusing prepared food needs reheated case virus lingers. COVID care teams separate staff rooms case unknowingly infected. 

We partnered staff level expertise advised things like cleaning schedules, cafeteria, waiting room process, etc. 

This week, surged much, quickly COVID-19 plan becoming obsolete. 

Our COVID-19 floor running space. We're going need start creating wings non COVID floors we're going need increase COVID teams. illness waiting room full.

We're actively trying tape bed space hallways, conference rooms, etc. needed early next week. 

We anticipated PPE stockpile would make August rationing would need start. PPE deliveries still shorter orders requested. never changed. Even reopened, still competing hospitals supplies. never chance build stockpile. sad part is, conversation would make cry didn‚Äôt laugh. I‚Äôm sick would want put sick elderly?

Asking humans stop physically-close social interaction months midst global pandemic doable reasonable. 

Asking humans stop physically close social interaction forever, well that‚Äôs interesting social experiment. personally think say way, accept risk is, many risks. new fact make dangerous even new. opposite - shows new way attack it. Whoosh Dr. Michael Osterholm involved study footage -- 20% mask-wearers that.

Source: would love 80% people around wore masks. would great improvement. I‚Äôm that. Cuomo done well since mid April initial fuck ups March heinous. De Blasio waited way long take seriously apparently plan place handle infectious outbreak. Shutting week earlier would prevented tens thousands deaths.

Uruguayan allowed. goes honeymoon plans already postponed wedding union strike fund? Shit, I'd donate go fund teachers fighting what's right. Good. need stop spreading virus everywhere. Good. exterminated too? Americans genocide. This. Everyone banned traveling EU this. travel countries allowed, Americans still banned. seem work well since country still outbreaks. Masks situations social distancing cannot maintained indoors viral load build time. Wearing mask beach bike path pretty meaningless unless crowded (in case leaving would better) planning stopping close conversations strangers (don't that).

I mean, would rather people wear masks often enough, fine wanna wear outdoors. much. someone American Euro passport, don‚Äôt care. Yes, enough risk getting sick. Imagine getting US, getting virus, insane cost hospital stay. Fuck that! doesn‚Äôt, ya see reddit, don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt know you. assumption makes ass bud. Idc think believe in. Also it‚Äôs hard tell anything person comment. Hey know human anus stretch 7 inches taking permanent damage? people America refuse wear masks stop spread people would never travel outside country begin with. ruin us enjoy people, places, culture outside borders. maybe sort emergency response benefit.

You mean socialism? *GASP!* favorite someone suggested inject bleach smoke UV light. less tests equals less cases. Jesus warn mask.... agree. 50% (due protesters young) people become infected asymptomatic, would never necessarily go get tested feel symptoms slowly spreading it... WALMARTS VIOLATIN MUH CON....CONSTI.....CONSTIPATION?.... CIVIL RIGHTS MAKING WEAR MASK Well compared developed nations is. Comment police downvoted oblivion even equally accurate. Yes. least partially aware that. Though, public health collective benefit whole State well individual, find entirely strange. 

I‚Äôm sorry write appears metaphorical viruses work decades, avarice, division, hubris, ignorance, suchlike. Covid perhaps easily addressed virus. Though, felt somewhat depressed I‚Äôm choosing think good somehow must come this. know Americans capable much more, trust crisis something better come. world looks America best, crosses fingers luck. I'd sources information know, government arrest reporters.

My government one run tangerine man may spiking convention probably make numbers spike more. great news Europeans! Same.

Also develop symptoms around 5-8 days, 2 weeks certainly stretch. also sure infectious first days viral load low.

That counter balanced high test positive rate suggesting testing, delay test results introducing lag.

Ultimately overall theme remains same, even tight lockdown would continue go number days first. closing bars hardly tight lockdown.

Hopefully enough stabilize spread social pressure reversed well. Wear mask often people without start feeling like selfish assholes. may accidental double counting numbers get allocated county level. Either way, +10k/day far away. Already has..  Asymptomatic extensive lung damage

Maybe I'd sources information know, government arrest reporters.  Ask former employer copy medical exposure file dates employed there. 

Under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1020, employees legal representatives given access information help detect, treat, prevent occupational disease right opportunity learn: 1) employee exposed job, 2) level exposure, 3) health consequences exposure(s). 

The standard establishes rights access basic information employees, legal representatives, OSHA. right access even former employee longer works company.

The standard defines paragraph (c) exposure medical records might contain. minimum, exposure records describe toxic substances harmful physical agents could exposed. records might include monitoring records showing levels exposure. medical records contain items medical questionnaires, results medical examinations laboratory tests performed connection job, first aid records, on-the-job medical complaints.

Your employer former employer required maintain medical exposure records created specific periods time. Paragraph (d) 1910.1020 requires employers keep exposure records 30 years. Paragraph (d) also requires employers keep medical records exposed employee long employed, plus 30 years. 

If questions ask information request, message directly. (I‚Äôm OSHA Outreach Trainer also served committee write standards OSHA.)

Things definitely start going back normal next year First, there‚Äôs quite people picture alone without masks. even wearing nose (defeating large part purpose). Second, outside many wearing masks, social distancing piece it‚Äôs - ignoring entirely.

I wish would stop excusing behavior fits particular narrative others. Personally think assholes regardless cause. immune cells

Don't lot people already know 'T cells"" are?

If guess pretty soon know.  Yeah know big hate Hillary, knew ""no Hillary"" vote there, I'm still worried reelection. Even pandemic personally know people planning voting him. I'm sure Biden win Oh come on. I'm speaking hypothetically data misinformation. I'm speaking directly CITY. believe? Maybe 10 people died? Maybe 20? Regardless, better 800 day. say 12k+ people currently hospitalized state... almost 1k added every day.

Since didnt read comment icu beds full, surge capacity 877 more. heard huge numbers people left city. population less half. Doesn‚Äôt change IQ strongly hereditary.

Are fucking stupid? original comment says ""Doesn‚Äôt change IQ strongly hereditary."" Clearly care.

Poor administration described folks enable unsafe working conditions pandemic. live red City southern California, shockingly almost everyone wearing masks flew Gatwick people pretty wonderful airport, traveled Oxford, people became friendly outright rude. Maybe location issue. 


I travelled Oxford loved Alice Wonderland, Lord Rings, Harry Potter.

That's coming china. weekend bad news tsunami. comes back home fly back Maybe money grow trees unemployment last forever. 

Wear masks limit capacity best point. people gonna get virus sooner later. It‚Äôs like deja vu. able prepare 4 months? Nothing. new cycle headlines back then. Lock downs, Ventilators PPE needed, 2000 dying per day, bodies stored trucks. AstraZeneca isn‚Äôt developing vaccine. They‚Äôre producing distributing would agree this, also cases per capita. state like vermont 400 cases/day different new york, allows comparison across board. No. looking windows. 100% true all.

Right talking first batch vaccines kind flu shot, meant immunize mitigate. think people Wales estimate much better comparison England. 

England 18x population scale figures accordingly deaths infections different.

England 160,000 infections.
Wales 15062 x18=271116.  folks refuse masks cry freedumb, thankfully live small towns aren‚Äôt worldly they‚Äôre much threat. fucks sake, Arizona opened month ago. takes couple week diagnosis. Lines nicely Phoenix protests looting.

Stop lying. Party science.  mocking fact d**m set thinks vaccine going come make everything better like Disney movie. impossible make effective vaccine 3 6 months, mention mass distribute it. normal people able go Walgreens CVS get vaccine want travel abroad, doubtful.

And statistical analysis major drug company Chicago. job reporting vaccines, especially flu vaccine. know ridiculous. lying people this, happened since March.

And yes, think panickers selfish. certain neuroses germs, fine. resent put life hold it. force well.

Most people comply laws.

Most people comply suggestions. live near nc/S.C. boarder, aside family, see 100 percent non-compliance unless working employer requires it. see statue wearing one, that. don‚Äôt written anywhere? think flu big deal.

there fairly large variance total number cases. I‚Äôm disappointed.

Am American. Same. Bar failed two things according picture --

Close waiting areas ask customers wait cars call table ready.

Require six feet separation parties groups different tables bar Seems like would easy thing quantify since enter customs way Canada leave checkpoint way Alaska. compare two numbers see discrepancy. Manslaughter charge hit testing capacity, percent positive won‚Äôt change unless restrict testing showing higher level symptoms. sad. I‚Äôm America I‚Äôve taking covid seriously start. Traveling new places entire purpose life won‚Äôt able leave country knows long. I‚Äôm embarrassed fellow Americans, ruined rest us. death numbers stable doesn‚Äôt seem right. bet there‚Äôs something funky going there. I‚Äôve monitoring available hospital capacity numbers seem like BS remained stable week despite increasing cases recently increased 24 35% available. aren‚Äôt best control spread.

How school closings lead riots exactly? I'll mission grift grift story First love good conversation thank you. make valid points. $40 ~165% price increase. That's pretty outrageous

I agree said much Im sure 30% would cover cost definitely closer accurate number still increase would factor non less some. primary problem service fee/tipping models deceitful

I disagree. long posted restaurant menu, deceitful auto-grat 8 tops higher. deceitful service fee delivery drivers pizza chains Administration service fee pay every month bill apartment. ""service fees"" lots different parts Sell $1,000, keep $100, add hourly ( 7.25*6) = $143 six hour shift. That's almost $24/hour! I've offered engineering jobs lower rate that. 

Totally agree thats lot. clarified servers would see increase hourly wage rather stay decreased rate pay tipped employees Im trying add cost restaurants. head thinking $1,000 sales 6 hour shift = $100+2.13/hourly pretty decent normal, decently busy night shift normal chain restaurant. 6 hour shift pretty common closing shift. 4-10 maybe another half hour closing duties. know happy OCharleys worked 4-5 nights week walked tipped $8.98)

Are telling server makes $8.98 hourly tips?? Wow... thats really really good. also I'm sure cost living way higher KY. increasing menu price would achieve financial result, it?

Easy answer yes, obviously point achieve thing Im sure buying public whole would view this. places advertise cheap easy. people want higher prices across board flat service fee? answered opinion discussing pizza chain service fee &amp; saw that.

Also, places work want upsell. Sell top shelf drink, sell dessert, sell bottle wine versus glass, bucket beer versus one, add shrooms onions bacon burger, etc etc, service fee actually helps entice staff par menu, specials, etc... 
If want come phone take 15% go home people always do, fine, know come really hustle push sell *know* see profit store also sees profit, bar/busser/kitchen need work harder business restaurant, see increased wage time like servers do. 

Totally flat disagree comes kitchen staff. give ya busser, point see going either way. bussed, made decent hourly would usually get minimum tip servers. usually found servers want roll silverware charge $20 it. people hate rolling silverware, lol.

But kitchen staff way get tips (again, exceptions rule, Mom&amp;Pop places, customer specifically asked tip kitchen, etc)
But, I'm serving Im working money. Kitchen staff work different rate always get hourly usually decent pay. Also, worked kitchen 3-4 hours dinner service tons prep hour close filtering cooking oil, cleaning, prep tmrw whatever. never felt like deserved tip out. never deal guest. Again, bar/busser/kitchen need work harder business restaurant, see increased wage time like servers do. 

Ha, unless kitchen staff prepared take pay cut days arent busy. give take. get easy Monday know going get whipped Friday. Hourly pay increase/decrease business hourly kitchen get bonus place full, sure felt motivated hustle faster.

True degree also goes back thought bad employees weeded out. make $10/hr busser night fuck busy get stand walk get high (Ive personally never got stoned bussing,lol) OK making $10/ hr busy. common jobs. lady working counter UPS store make less depending whether 4 customers today 100. 

Good chat. Thanks insight. knows answer though suspect never change though. know downvoted.

I agree you. Americans die, extra profits rich quietly set sacrifice commons. America, land greed, selfishness, cruelty. tried follow rules, none customers chose to. close again. Basically proves bars cannot reopened, people follow rules. Early new cases playing catch up. time testing capacity place seeing growth much earlier.

It took month Irans second wave translate increases deaths deaths bad first wave. Galactic point. Despite accounts, main Reddit coronavirus sub serves excellent news-aggregator.

As American, that‚Äôs see everything. people know anti vaccine worries autism. ""concerned"" effective. even 1% effective minimizes risk I'm getting damn thing. think they're mostly afraid getting shots need excuse. never leave US government increases test capacity.
""Less tests equals less cases"" big brain move right there. /s I‚Äôm also healthcare hospital. don‚Äôt really feel influx inpatients cases coming hospital lockdown today would stop rise new cases per day 2 weeks. guess Florida already peak testing capacity, new confirmed cases across nation could easily exceed 55,000 per day less 10 days, many unable tested. lockdowns need start new cases per day increase 10% week, new cases per day 400% want make list bad country is?

From slaughter American Indians United States use humans human experimentation, could also list long list.

But think ""democratically elected"" president could nothing get re-elected, yes ""nothing"", watch Americans die.

Such system. excellent system.

""It used said great thing American system could keep system running even let pig White House, I'm kind convinced.""

""-but pigs add problem."" American currently living Switzerland (but unfortunately moving back states little month), I‚Äôve asked ‚Äúhow got in‚Äù recently. 
Have also asked (which quite ‚Äúforward‚Äù Swiss) thought government, president* Covid response. Putin's wet dream. Europe still opening July 1st  That's worst case scenario.

And I'm asking case fatality rating.

I'm talking worst case scenario. literally thing fear corona giving someone won‚Äôt recover. i‚Äôm young (mostly lol) healthy, fine get many people won‚Äôt be. don‚Äôt understand people completely selfish. know answer that. course would protest rationing. ‚ÄúNo government tell nothing.‚Äù reason studying first place?! mean, I‚Äôm American wouldn‚Äôt let in. Yes material shirt gives rash. Gonna use third country hub, expensive take forever, unless every single country bars flights USA, still possible. Sorry, we're going need confiscate bid high enough. Interesting graph really starkly illustrates questionable China's reported case numbers must be. 1/5th world's population barely blip graph shit fined filing lawsuit charged money back fees it. Chicago relatively successful managing pandemic date. role major air hub keeps risk things going badly wrong.  instance, says 1,048 flights per week Houston (emerging hotspot) Chicago. think likely number pre-pandemic. - even 90% fewer flights - would plenty people arriving one country's current problem areas. flights Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Carolinas, etc, etc.

I camped farm Indiana since February would love drive back apartment Chicago head beach. - unless less isolate apartment would feel far, far dangerous. Plus, large reason going city eat out, go bars, etc.

I cannot imagine Americans ever fortitude essentially cut areas outbreaks (like China Wuhan Italy Bergamo), let alone taking Vietnamese approach stopping intercity movement completely figured (an apparently successful) way manage pandemic. Vietnam land border China, 90 million people near healthcare resources richer countries, reports zero COVID19 fatalities.

F-35‚Äôs. know, batshit insane ranting I've heard anti-mask crowds public forums could good way get .45 ACP buried someone's chest. get frustration people sound completely unhinged looking take someone. need go Alaska air travel. need drive Canada via Banff Jasper. entitled bunch. 7% must store today. Nobody seems mentioning add: also locking seniors immune suppressed citizens better were. Good. Teach jackasses lesson. I‚Äôm getting plane fourteen hours bunch Americans anyway. mean, still resurgence large enough cause lockdowns, it'd foolish think things can't happen even countries cases way down.

Now, theorize, imagine we'll see quite number outbreaks due people different countries meeting various vacation spots. world's international country let guard yet. Stay home a/c on?  indifferent race-baiting shit

Trump race baiting?

That's fuckin' cute. just...drive another state get plane case though. People shouting AMEN constantly. said lot really weird shit people.  Yeah can't follow basic instructions cool got world showcase Epcot Florida.



/s thread awesome You‚Äôre saying 5% death rate...that‚Äôs even close accurate That's sub does. always have. One article released fits narrative, run it. quoted referenced time time again. article inkling good news potential good news gets dragged. 

It long ago people losing Kawasaki like disease children. People going terrible kids much trouble cancel school nuts. I'm parent took news seriously, sub losing it, good way.

Also, notice way mention vaccine often met someone saying ""we may never one"" ""the oxford vaccine distributed everyone (insert amount time here)."" true, bad thing. Distribution start somewhere. 


The bottom line sub EXTREMELY pessimistic. likely never change. I'm boat. Dont disappointed us, angry let leaders know. Shame action. We've tried logic reason didnt work dying faster ever. Sorry, DC supply chain jargon. Distribution Center. :-) Yeah optimistic people think change anyone's minds? They've embracing wrong shit years. Ppl may real medical conditions mask exempt like vaccine exempt people. happened really quickly Mississippi April 4 flip-flop CDC. Masks started showing seemed cascade. want self-conscious wearing mask feeling like pariah mine broke store. Others talk said same: ""I wear mask want asshole."" way Japan handled awful too. many people unable return homes, families, businesses whatever else passport different country. Denying permanent residents left bad taste everyone's mouth. see governments world immature nice. CDC ones told us wear masks, lol. Spain here. comparison, 46m population, maxed around 9000 per day. double Floridas population. Right? midwest actually second-best region country northeast.

But anything put people like, guess. Like half assed american plans, talked talk lack competency work ethic walk walk. national authorities talked things like testing every nursing home student, testing random sample 12,000 americans get gauge prevalency, etc. follow . We're testing all, totally normal!  Trump rushes something election, I‚Äôd suspicious too. People reporting outright lying. percent people see wearing store? You‚Äôre ‚Äúdoomer‚Äù realistic. whole reason even second wave begin lot people don‚Äôt discipline social distance. record scientists claim still first wave virus. privileged entitled society want way time anything makes us uncomfortable ignore. 

There‚Äôs difference hopefully optimistic ignorantly-positive. I‚Äôm business owner, student, social individual mid twenties, trust people can‚Äôt wait return normality. I‚Äôm given exact news every day everyone given, judging aggressive statistics virus it‚Äôs point indisputable fact aren‚Äôt done virus yet. donated blood 7 days announced this. I'll wait awhile donate find out. surprised. even little bit That's good sign boring personality. There's much dude. Learn new skill, find new hobby, watch old movies seen before, start television series. There's much do, cant find interest anything, that's you. Dumb animals dumb things. Shocking. seems us parents keep kids home keep home parents choice send kids school like normal could reduced capacity make feasible schools actually implement enforce safety measures. best everyone. Definitely keeping kid home option year. German: popcorn phase ended spring. people know hoping Americans stop voting Trump. time current ""opponent"" Biden joke. Bernie still running, thought, America would join us first world nation November. I'm at, too.

I see articles exploring wonder inevitable without radical intervention. saying ""i DoNt tRuSt tEh GuBbErMiNt"" means I'm critical thinker. Summary:

 

* Neighbours complained body posed risk others
* Local authorities used earth mover transport body really shouldn‚Äôt seen controversial all. USA didn‚Äôt allow Europeans country cases high either. banning flights America protect rest world infected us? responsible thing do? American, keep trash side ocean. awe,,,, that's sweet. working together times like calling putting masks 'political problem'. &lt;3 need pee eventually Lol google Austin protests. vast majority mask on. every major city‚Äôs protest. lacked masks. Plus, masks even less effective people yelling.

This pure propaganda. either means social distancing outside completely pointless people lying regards protests playing part convenient covid spikes 2 weeks later. morons dont entire apparatus nation's top health intelligence experts briefing every day.  tragic comment lmao  LOL don‚Äôt even know national teacher shortage l, qualified weigh subject. physical guides, tape floors **sidewalks** signage walls ensure customers remain least six feet apart lines. article says experts believe child got virus  Uh spoiler alert please? Thank Mr. Spock. following elections I'm American, judging little see reddit think likely gets re-elected. hope guys get rid him, though, get President mental age older eight. Man, much hurt evangelicals putting world mistake veiled political commentary Nero apocalypse prophecy? sounds like got WMDs there... feeling quirky might check out. Perhaps poll anyone Trump rallies. makes wonder level spreading Pakistan. report UK couple days ago showed significant number infections originated Pakistan, HK adds that. American, especially shouldn‚Äôt allow trump. idea ban travel America? I‚Äôm American living UK, allowed date? holiday booked late July... worry keeping way. one school expects come person won‚Äôt allow online classes me. GuLp think confusing tests. live virus tests ones 30% false negative (but nearly zero false positive) rate. antibody tests like 99% accurate. seen big difference rates based test manufacturer. feel you, guys, sounds ridiculous... went America well treated. Talking average American, average, common situations. I‚Äôm sick sheep criticise without knowing you. numbers far today Arizona's 7 day average 3074-on June 16th 7 day average 1543 doubled 12 days. got terminated week ago job offered employment early March. received job offer, better company, 2 days terminated. short, there‚Äôs TON job openings right every field. I‚Äôm sure wanted find something different field, could. It‚Äôs worth risking health (again) company seems care well employees IMO. Meth. he's done both. Summary:

 

* Sharon Dai CAPA Centre Aviation says authorities slow coming agreements
* Subhas Menon Association Asia-Pacific Airlines says travel restrictions need relaxed quarantine measures lifted political day one Trump's ridiculous travel ban China. Chinese people allowed travel US, repatriated Americans China could, without quarantine checks whatsoever. Cuz, know, there's way 'muricans could get sick cHiNeSe virus right? worst case US would imagine, pretty. 

We're coming hurricane season ignoring pandemic. quiet, rate healthcare systems communities may left desperately fighting both. 

There already massive unrest. There's already riots. 

People unemployed, underemployed, broke. There's looming eviction crisis. 

I know state food supply chain. seems fine now, happens may show later. 

It's really bad mix. Letting pandemic run control failed lockdown massive civil unrest just... pretty picture. would say average Texan recall seeing news huge numbers deaths New York, still remember Jade Helm us banned hate sub kid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è know spreading Florida things getting bad residents (even seniors) seem Lol, trump literally saying absolute authority ban people shtihole countries since 2016 ""drugs violence something, idk"" power conduct screening international travelers pandemic????? Trying reading fucking book dude. imo smart person stays date research opinions whole teams world class doctors/medical researchers almost qualified researchers speak subject.

If people listen one staff name recognition works me. course. Also students people registered address Europe enter. Americans traveling China instructed quarantine 14 days. government wasn‚Äôt anything enforce it. goes listed countries think EMTs getting hazard pay right now? They've always made less teachers. grocery store employees? hazard pay ended. teachers feel entitled? Preach bother, worn pants button 4 months. Used wear suit 5 days week. fishy all. data guys blew whistle, mangement cover up. hey, China hides information, would never! feel exact way. want take it? Fine, means could get sooner.

Does feel kind shitty that's thought process, honestly gives relief solid chance getting sooner. American, makes sense. I‚Äôm actually DFW. there? movie like 15 years oldü§£ Good post. ‚Äúeveryone going get it‚Äù crowd lying. Agreed. try put mask whenever see server approaching well. 

The reason I've gone restaurant far chaperone parents think masks overreaction. Fortunately good judgy stare behave me, there's accounting behavior I'm there. They're learning wonders mobile pay week. Trump put wall high none us get mindset kid, learning disability, probably get little effective education next year, repeat grade 2021-22.

I think that's probably realistic. may something like en masse. Damn! can‚Äôt afford anyways lol. But, wanted go Euro Itchy Scratchy Land! imo smart person stays date research opinions whole teams world class doctors/medical researchers almost qualified researchers speak subject. European can't stop wondering US masochistic envy somewhere .. no, self isolation.

Stupid Americans, always mixing things /s 650 000 people die respiratory diseases linked seasonal flu new estimates published today, 291,000 646,000 people worldwide die seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses Kills 646,000 People Worldwide Year: European, miss :-) EU: 'Merica, Fuck No! can't give hard data (I'm sure hard find them), someone travelled lot Europe, tourists Europe itself.

Tourism currently fucked anyways, regardless Americans travelling not.  	2,617,847	cases US 128,243 deaths

128,243/2,617,847 = 4.899% Gotcha. 
I‚Äôm going get few.
Thx u Good God. ramblings absolutely unintelligible. Ah yes another political nut thread. love 100k deaths signicant reeducation camps. support reeducation camps related topic thread. insecure twit. Hence history. life, nobody. Europe wack anywhere, think America got it‚Äôs racism I'm day 4 self-isolation return US. check ups yet. Temperature taken Heathrow.

Cheers, mate. finally? internal borders closed months open 1st July. Shutdown crazy risky thing do.

It's least craziest least riskiest thing do. That‚Äôs good idea. think closed leader exactly people want though. elected people. people‚Äôs fault much his. Makes sense. Tried read article, first set ""hindering progress"" ads Hey, good luck stay safe. show going combative. would use caution someone comes showing one cards. also would tell likely wear mask anywhere following cdc guidelines. want less ""control"" stores end needing security protect staff people continue comply simply wearing mask. counterproductive. passports taken, burnt cinder, catapulted quarantine Moonbase Alpha. need start ""Keep Hockey Canada"" campaign. Using brain taking proper actions myself. Yeah need someone tell do. think people like can‚Äôt think problem. familiar difference cash equity? I‚Äôm pretty angry neighbours fucking stupid got bed absolute moron didn‚Äôt see shit show coming. November going YUGE deal. Get man office. mention knife attacks going lately. surprised tend sort medieval thick cloth light armor modern addition well filtered sealed air helmet. see ""good news""? horrible. 7% never wearing mask. 80% including ""sometimes"". ugh. havent spoken words months but... wait couple weeks Coronavirus subdivision 3 Gorges discussed here. genetic test common form EDS (hypermobile type III) various theories is. yeah, could least rule others Coupled cells immune system cross reactive viruses, like coronaviruses. one could immune response that‚Äôs fighting COVIDs coronavirus without producing materials found current response body COVID. Antibodies, antigens. Wow. realized talking fucking pedophile.

Kindly go away, dude. Kindly crawl whole die. Sounds familiar. SA? Thank God rest world America's bullshit. American state that‚Äôs EXTREMELY careful observant regulations, fuck y‚Äôall. You‚Äôre disgrace. Good. rest us. broke house put pictures family. Wear mask, american. 7% selfish jerks. me. kids family. Key taken hospital. aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs isolation center. sick go hospital.  that‚Äôs you, good you. doubt speak sizable majorities western country Fewer nursing home outbreaks better clinical care. Definitely get worse hospitals become overwhelmed like they‚Äôre looking might. Yeaaaah U.S. handling virus much worse. I‚Äôm trying imply it‚Äôs everywhere every chain &amp; every mom pop restaurant go see anyway, right? Cause stay home fly pandemic, right? somewhat agree take. Everyone focusing babysitting part school ignoring education essential. online schooling increase disparities working internet parents commit time energy hold children accountable. tons research summer break sets back child's knowledge. imagine kid classroom March 2020 September 2021. I've plans emigrate end 2021 since well pandemic, ironically large part get away incompetency. sucks. did. California lots testing capability now, deaths hospitalized dropped 25%. Hospitals ready stocked PPE. Canadians need app report American license plates direct route Alaska.

 Really made fly there. Repatriation flights free cheap citizens taking would like speak ur boss anyone know applies people transit? I‚Äôve stuck US since global lockdowns started can‚Äôt get back home nonstop flight. I'm familiar magnitude rise Japan, people still immunity cases going inevitable things open. necessarily represent failure, long testing/tracking infrastructure remains robust rate increase kept low enough avoid strain healthcare system. load option? decent wage you‚Äôre used making $30-$50 hour find great place serve at? That‚Äôs issue tip system know, fortunate get PTO benefits bartending gig. far optimistic I, hospital worker, would would build surge field hospitals, times war natural disaster. means beds tents stadiums convention centers throughout nation.

I believe inevitable although think we're going see disproportionate impacts barring radical congressional intervention necessary late winter early worst possible scenario.

This worst case scenario. important thing remember available beds spread evenly throughout state. hospitals population centers almost full, lot empty beds rural areas. means start shifting patients around free beds needed presents whole host serious problems.

My country thing April hit peak, even shifting patients Germany (thanks that, btw). kind problems present? local media presented moves patients rural hospitals quite matter-of-factly. It‚Äôs also possible testing testing low-to-no symptom people, versus NY testing mostly seriously sick people. much don‚Äôt know. slow? It‚Äôs terrible Texas could avoided road. aren‚Äôt even publishing ICU information now. Source? can't find one...including JHU CDC. Brooklyn NY.
She got sick took primary care doctor could refill meds.
This second week October. couldn‚Äôt fight thought cold flu. taking counter stuff home remedies.
She refused go doctor.
I called 11/13 completely disoriented wanted go back bed despite 3 hrs. got took urgent care. fluid lungs, low oxygen level high heart rate.
 initially took refill script oxygen level 98. urgent care 75. 
Urgent care sent Ambulette emergency room. 8 days couldn‚Äôt figure improve breathing affecting lungs. 
Looking back definitely Covid19. Well shit, escalated quickly Anheiser Busch contributes more. McDonalds contributes more. Ford/Chevy/Dodge contribute more. 
I‚Äôll continue live life without fear. get it, I‚Äôll stay home, would got flu/mono/strep. want. strange way saying things lol Bavarian support action however mean Trump can't come over. Lol! think problem school provides child care working parents. jobs let said parents work four day week.

I dont good answer. Shall build memorial? humans number neck bones

Thanks, i'm going thinking weeks now. I‚Äôm angry America - mostly trump Bidens age least 16 that's bonus Yes mention, eating outside generally better experience. Serotonin levels probably way you‚Äôre sitting outside 70 80¬∫ weather. Well, I'm seeing 1/2 people grocery store wearing them, polls really mean hell lot, frankly. That's nice- want see obscene rates childhood poverty child abuse, keep schools closed. think like Rob DeSantas guy. Prior ER getting 1/2 patient testing positive Covid. it‚Äôs 5/6 day. 

But also discharge lot well. come get stabilized sent home look that, thank you!  mean, frequently see groups younger people partying outside masks, people supermarkets, waiting rooms etc wear masks noses....The calm going stay people give shit. lot serious incompetence roll that. Unfortunately lot information heavily suppressed can't even bring happened here. research want, I'm interested spending evening roasted reddit. think could go wrong harvest en masse vaccine monkey kidney cells?  2 things 1. cost rapid tests 2. amount stock already purchased regular tests.  wont throw inventory away, doctors likely get little something monetarily use certain tests. That's big pharma you. town I‚Äôm like 1% 

I‚Äôm 1% They're basically hoping first batch vaccines ""flu shot"" bridge us ""real"" vaccine road. feeling October pushed deadline election November. agree. He's done horrible job. listened Fauci people blame failure. he's poster child increase cases lately. Exactly like condom, gun. Yeah everyone cleaned everywhere can‚Äôt even find respirator work. everyone needs p100 Stock market hit time highs see college campuses reopen safely fall. Campuses reopen rigorous guidelines students probably adhere weeks, unless rules vigorously enforced be, adherence rules eventually break massive outbreak follow. teaching, I'd 400 students shoulder shoulder lecture hall. dorms jammed. Normal flu generally rips campus every year like clockwork. can't imagine fall person reopening disaster. Conversely, experts say US could Covid-free 2045. Unemployment benefits set end couple weeks, house senate swapping vacation schedules, states starting close - economic plan place... aren‚Äôt ingredients economic collapse like we‚Äôve never seen before? missing something? bout toddlers? Everytime I've seen toddlers stores without masks parents letting touch anything I‚Äôm side world (currently) control one laughing. Dumbfounded politicians saying doing. Extremely worried citizens. laughing. 

In early press conference leader (and use term lightly) said ‚Äúthe entire world watching us, impressed‚Äù. Suffice say got first part statement right second part couldn‚Äôt truth. want get tested want possibly infect anyone. best thing self isolate Yes. did. first step dealing crisis.

Instead taking step 2, proclaimed ""job done"" reopened. That's hubris. setup effective testing--not even close. put kids school two weeks pulling back out. checks consist temperature checks door, indicates fevers symptomatic person (and spreading) time.

If blood tests, person could exhibit antibodies yet, could false negative, could even contract immediately tested know next test. Blood tests still immediate US.

We know anything virus. planet, existence, around six months. ridiculous think know does, interacts, long-term effects. Every day learn something new--we learned multiple means infect cells, may lead lifelong infections, asymptomatic carriers may retain antibodies. three new revelations discovered past three days.

I sit university's IRB every time someone mentions risk/benefit calculation point that, since know risks, can't calculate relative benefits. One try rationalize jumping roof pool, pool's depth unknown foolish calculation. anymore asked would control us, said ‚Äúthey take guts put vacuum tubes belly, make control center move muscles like puppet‚Äù since control muscles hope make exercise, lockdown made squishy described certified teacher‚Äôs assistants exist, special education.

EDIT: NY, run (restrictive) special ed rooms 6:1:12 (6 assistants, 1 teacher, 12 students). vary less supportive (e.g; 4:1:8, 2:1:10). Shit ton people died. comment fucking stupid considering much state suffered March, April. Trump thought rhetoric would able compete virus. Obviously, didn‚Äôt happen still, day, can‚Äôt accept it. IDK. We're quite point per capita. FL TX seeing 2-4 times rate are. 

At least we're waiting get do... Something. Yes, go get science usually get it, Facebook. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool doubt doubt doubt IMHE also said we'd cap 60k deaths tho Here‚Äôs GitHub file deaths NYC. Today 2 confirmed 9 I‚Äôm Texas, Supreme Court said reason expand mail-in voting. üôÑ mean decent pandemic plan, got tossed. Let's see says 2 weeks. Random:

I read South African voice, like dude District 9. learn MISTAKES. governments around world fucked senior care. Canada 80% deaths long-term care. Opened fast looking take responsibility. Good ol' Conservative playbook work. Always find scapegoat. Yeah freakin way 80% truthful. go Walmart Im Literally person wearing mask employees. Orange County San Diego county still open. desperate call aa agree. least Australia govt. welfare people lost jobs result iso. can't possibly. I've seen Arizona already. appendix burst need emergency surgery. Quick, someone get Donald Trump! ABOARD AMERICAN PROPAGANDA TRUCK. Fucking terrifying shit. ever cocaine psychosis, know deal. resign. events.

To young again. beginning long journey human stupidity. 

The good news people really evolving ways would hope. new 1%. 

The question whether use powers good future.

Spoiler: won't.!&lt; I'd say numbers accurate area...but California mandated mask use. county opened mask law place I'd say 10% people stores wore masks person workplace wore mask. honestly can't imagine numbers accurate anywhere else unless ""some time"" means bought mask, tried decided want continue  long hospital system able handle it. whole point. hide indefinitely. Plus vast majority people wear masks outside. vasculitis.

From read, many people COVID primarily attacks blood vessels. happened Italy?

No. Maybe lives New York. large percentage United states total deaths crazy think 12% subset deaths happened there. seatbelts then. look around people evolved backwards.

Higher standards living, people get comfortable, complacency, many physical threats survival. Maybe great evolution. oh fuck them, right? mean, cares die. Haha, cause cruise ships proved safe. kidding aside, special quarantine boats spend two weeks on, forty days... record numbers new cases daily, DeSantis still can't something provide unified rules entire state. Beaches open places closed others, mask wearing required places others. total mess there's one plan state. guy needs stop playing politics worry lives live state. 

I feel bad know live work there, 'essential workers' dealing public. So, hyperindividualist, want whole community wear mask everyone's benefit? ü§î FoxNews setting national policy quite time. Trump political experience, little patience nuances public service. people wearing masks probably bother poll... Must polled Texas. I‚Äôd say 1% wear mask. 99% wear gun cowboy hat said, common sense important research do.

Personal bias something consider, varies depends asking. Visiting r/T_D asking Mexicans good people probably leave biased answer, sure.

But asking Americans dual citizenship allowed travel Europe, post Americans banned travelling Europe due coronavirus, sub *about* Coronavirus perfectly reasonable thing do. 

It's context, question asked appropriate. even got honest, correct answer, knows answer question.

It case ""reddit biased"", large varied place, everything relevant somewhere. ""Don't research reddit"" great stance have, blanket statement, appropriate every circumstance. vaccine ever approved use previous forms coronavirus. Shouldn‚Äôt hard, photos attendees floating around Really? worked '90s, new state asked teachers unions. said Arizona right work state, told union, union power (not sure one). union help teachers, great. hope something protect teachers, students, staff. communication leadership different think would possible. bunker boy would wear m+a+g+a mask told people needed save ameeican lives think would beena different story. Yup. Whether it‚Äôs mandated not, make like Nike Funny hearing talk it. description ‚Äúyounger people‚Äù driving people 25 40. basically people possibly working capable finding time means go long vacations, bar hopping, etc. Also, continuing call ‚Äúyounger people,‚Äù respect nursing home residents devastated, kind gives impression they‚Äôre trying blame kids, full grown adults making poor decisions that‚Äôs contributing spread. personally, I've come one month. possible side effects could take longer manifest that, I'm balancing cautiousness need immunity. one month, starting see reports significant problems norm (obviously anything cause rare reactions whatever, mean statistically significant increase adverse reactions we'd normally expect vaccine).

I plan continue quarantining month. fully believe vaccines one needs around unvaccinated ass I'm waiting out.

But want make sure cause immediate serious reactions la 1976, first batch flawed way due sloppy QC.

I'll probably line Batch 2, certain extent, there's risks matter choice make here. man congestive bias. them, us admit discuss like grown ass adults. Others throw around insults divert instead practicing introspection. Try sometime, you‚Äôll better person it. fact triggered kind proves point strawman Joe comment. Apparently not. ü§≠ Ok, getting warmer, caused virus spread humans? I'm med school lot people levels (students, professors, doctors) said would hold vaccine adequate safety data available similar vaccines.  Agree shit situation. feel business owners going fail lives lost due virus. There's good answer point Seriously, nothing piss someone turn walk away. want someone yell theure big boys now, big boys get wumen.. parks opened? think Kings Island yet. lol people downvoting me. stake this, I'd like see goes 2 months ago, people talked India completely unaffected Covid. September seems far away. explosion cases July 4th coming up... July going long month. Maybe August page ready really take pandemic seriously. Oh, know that. Idk, don‚Äôt underestimate get way ego.

The existence someone like Fauci makes Trump deeply insecure; can‚Äôt handle someone smarter is, let alone much much much smarter Tomorrows *media* headlines. Right. That's same. talking pot. never crossed mind many might want wrong? is, typically, culturally-learned belief. Well. Considering everything coming possible permanent effects regular young healthy people, also yourself. people Texas changed behavior recent days due rise cases? 

I drove local mall near live Austin see many people there.

No. No, learned shit. Place pretty damned full many masks parking lot. weak man is. like daddy Donald. think joking like getting wreck wearing seatbelt refuse pay bills right thing. close stuff won‚Äôt come. places spiking responsible like New York. rocket science fact way beat virus simple. Wear fucking mask that‚Äôs Here‚Äôs plan 1/3 strike, 1/3 sue rest y‚Äôall catch covid n probably die. valved 3M n95 masks woodworking put hand near valve exhale, feel air movement.

I bought stop glasses fogging up, work great. This, unfortunately, main way stop virus. north-central PA mask-wearers minority. Typically I‚Äôm one store one besides staff (and I‚Äôve seen plenty without). husband frequents gun shops nobody ever wears there, busy hell (sales 80% time last year - source: store owner). I'll take well, may issues getting there... Swede living America double banned. Agree, wholeheartedly, someone ‚Äúhidden‚Äù disability. confronted using handicap badge (and use absolutely necessary). questioned possible work. never ok. explain non medical professional disabilities.

It infuriates people using ADA policy wear mask, fraudulently. I‚Äôve seen comments local news feeds...it‚Äôs quite sad flippant.

Personally, feel, environment, grocery delivery, curbside pickup etc reasonable accommodations, wear mask.

My state finally went mandatory face masks (thank goodness), husband said (he goes often), people simply complying. former homeschooler‚Äîyou SPOT ON. institutionalized education great parents unable current circumstances life situations health reasons, etc. able, natural process. 
Sure, kids drive FREAKING BONKERS day long, but....they YOURS! :) 
The idea NEED institutions education, part industrialized nations. needed people STOP producing (and produce corporations) needed separate people idea even could produce themselves. Believe not, dirt space, produce food, educate children, work family. Modern society makes seem strange, humans survived point, institutionalized education ‚Äúrecently‚Äù, terms existence, become part society. Sure enjoy many luxuries modern life, survive this, kids‚Äîthey better equipped (less bitter) ever be! short 12 16 week immunity span correct Wear mask. mix local. I've talked lot parents' neighbors truly believe either A) entire pandemic fake, B) stop testing, virus go away.

The beaches packed tourists, also know locals continuing life normal. I'm often one wearing mask anywhere.

I also NY plates told (/yelled at) virus around brought ""northern liberals"". First need stop needless death Fox News cancer society last two decades. Realistically, gets bad, live 4 hrs Canadian border. Hoping gay grant us refugee status...lol.... Yup. public hears health minister top officials hospital's preparing plans decide lives (likely) dies people likely take seriously.

Unfortunately go afternoon kooks mask less, go high compliance. Yeah, far removed. Sorry, man. neither lot older generation. live, restaurants packed full 50+ year olds. septuagenarian charge executive branch done way damage ""younger people"" could. I‚Äôd put blame Kemp, CDC  wonder long test results take around there. Georgia, cases skyrocketing delay getting results back notable, people told 2-4 days taking like 7-10 days.

Maybe test results returned timely manner people would less tempted things like this. least, they'd less time things like this. OP symtoms Covid.

Thought fucked life. Barely left bed, much brain fog. bizzare.

Took 6 weeks, feel mostly better now. covid symtoms notice. dealing benzodiazapine withdrawl stopped right covid cognitive issues is... another leauge worse. Looks like Georgia‚Äôa got serious case exponential growth sacrifice shutdown turned sacrifice opening, damn fine job continuing sacrifice asses economy........fucking hell..... devastating see misled public been. everything else going country COVID single greatest threat we‚Äôve seen many years huge amount people blowing off, part they‚Äôve told it‚Äôs big deal. Fucking idiots

Typical Lake Travis kids lmao new flag South baby covering ears yelling ""wha wha no!"" frigid breezy meat packing plants. key ingredients allowing droplets move around wide range people. Additionally know louder voices accelerate far droplets move without conditions, meat packing plants loud, workers loud communicate other.

Here's You‚Äôd right thinking that. argument lockdown/no lockdown irrelevant. ship sailed gone. masks statistically reduce spread huge rates efficiency! wish people would comply Texas evangelicals first line reelect Abott Lt Dan, even Dan said elderly sacrifice Mammon. well dine studies show 0,6-1,6 really hope didn‚Äôt make 14 day quarantine upon arrival. honestly know, could eaisly sure someone would figured already Lol that's happened.. that's vaccine. changed it. \*gets up\* 
\*picks baseball bat way door\* 
\*Sounds smashing furniture breaking glass room\* 
\*walks back calmly sits down, tossing broken bat aside\*

I feel better wardrobe's broken. Haha ‚Äúthe left‚Äù ...okay. vast majority protestors wore masks outside, crowded bars crying wear mask. They‚Äôve done contact tracing studies protests showed little spread came - opposed southern states people pretending disease doesn‚Äôt exist insurance companies refuse pay COVID medical bills people refused wear mask.

I know joking let's reward bloodsucking middle-men another technicality they'll abuse deny people healthcare. actual title article.

Gov. McMaster: South Carolina enough hospital beds despite surge COVID-19 patients

900 COVID hospitalizations small percentage beds available near critical level.

Downvoted dishonest fear inducing title. 

Sounds like they're trying avoid panic. panic would get people act. Good luck that... Think good idea put cages separated parents. Even Asylum migrants included. think know point I'm making intentionally obtuse. truly hope country find way  almost like ""protests lead spikes!"" people wanted narrative turns wrong can't accept that. come? want to. asking. 7% Americans live stores me. says kid using zero logic. RemindME! 1 week. idea much testing goes blood cleared blood bank? screen Hep B HIV. I'm trans, wanted give blood transitioned, allowed. second gender marker changed, ban mysteriously went away. different note weird two pictures woman bathing suit tag line "" woman turns heads""? Like normal Australian article? CAD special, print infinity leveraging real estate market.

The print money higher GDP goes. I'll believe Ms. Pelosi serious funds enforcement, includes authorization fines jail time, see it. words. Yes news watch comrade? logic makes perfect sense. Arizona reopens May 8, bars restaurants may 13. starts two weeks ago. That‚Äôs nearly 1.5 months ago. May 29, protests AZ CA start. Two weeks later, June 14, surges kick states. surge younger population. 

So take 1.5 months see surge two weeks Similar situation well. I'm bartender local Tampa restaurant handful confirmed cases shut down. Also, fuck management/the owners trying ban us talking ""speading fear workplace."" flag positive already positive containment strategy flat work, get flare ""have"" open parents need state funded daycare, sure. local containment opening schools probably work, testing not. hurts us try open we're ready.

Containment I'm talking about.

1. Test
2. Trace
3. Isolate

I elevate importance testing, that's need demand government.

I'll ignore mass behaviors second.

There tracing isolating happen naturally. think people get positive test result, already ok job staying home, telling people they've spent lot time with. people already ok job staying home. could improved, getting masses perfect behaviors insanely difficult. way cheaper get testing right, help comparison. I'm saying testing cheap easy, improving 2 &amp; 3 harder.

Once get testing right, discuss improve next stages.

About behaviors masses:

Probably easiest things wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands.    I'll stop go next steps, people go crazy. Man ever seen 28days later? Anyway moon landing actually filmed California. I‚Äôm saying didn‚Äôt go moon, absolutely flew there. problem space suit big fit lander hatch. turned around came back. That‚Äôs birds got replaced drones. Also shot jfk. gonna tell everyone gay conversation fema camps Walmart. know they‚Äôre connected massive underground tunnel network.

Agreed, don‚Äôt think super spreaders, R0 2 child child, child adult problem kids go back school think sure are. problem people critical age group sometimes still work (we 30s husband sure works ppl well 60) kids/grandkids come house think that‚Äôs lot issue comes in. careful know limited control husband comes contact work. It‚Äôs hard, can, wish everyone did! Probably. There's hope Texas. Abbot expressed regret reopening quickly seeing error ways wrote moments ago.

Let's get global pandemic first, may well end far less consumerism going forward. Flatten curve turned delay curve else do? confirmed covid least spreading. experience UK people stay side normal protests going on?

I mean hazard zones friends terrified leave apartments month drivers dragged cars beaten blocks live. Daggum whippersnappers. Can't control 'em, golly. even mean? 

Someone asking legit question makes malicious actor? they‚Äôre stupid?

You realize sole purpose sub get information coronavirus? Yeah! Bring from.....where? Nobody right MIND would set foot current dumpster fire. People listen public health officials. 1300 said risk protesting worth it. houston, 60K+ protesters standing shoulder shoulder, large outbreak. attended Mass past two weeks close contact Uma√±a asked monitor health consider tested virus.

Meaning still service I've seeing VA. Northern VA, specifically. state mandate I've never seen anyone giving store employees, certainly enforcing it, much trouble. (Although even masks mandated whole state, would say 50% mask wearing going on, particularly residents neighborhood.) someone whose flown recently, shown symptoms still get tested? Even feel weren‚Äôt exposed, increase risk? Let explain something. States closing bars, restaurants bars. Sooooo people sit bars food day. Literally nothing changed. bars food liscense get around various liquor laws. hole walls selling Lipton cup soup called restaurant. understand people. Like, think filling hospitals?  [It's shame long term effects COVID-19 real.](http://globalnews.ca/news/7111094/coronavirus-scientists-health-problems/) Even valid strategy ignore fact willing let 16 million Americans die (taken current mortality rate US), dangerous let virus run rampant like mutates viruses do, suddenly herd immunity ain't looking good virus changes enough reinfect people. Seriously, non-scientific viewpoints like fucking dangerous spreading around like exactly reason country position in. different definition asymptomatic something 

their death rate 1.8%.... almost every symptomatic person died? wearing properly? I've seen nanny adults mask chin nose Look, get wrong.

To me, signs point lab-made virus (and guess: released accidentally).

And ""signs"" mean: similarity RaTG13 ... unlikeliness pangolin/bat cross contamination wild ... furin site insertion.

I think HIV sequence similarities proven (or, said, *significant*) things mentioned. I'm sorry assassinating world leader clearly talking mortality rate. Correct I'm wrong, in't [only one human (smallpox) that's successfully eradicated? Even diseases like scarlet fever bubonic plague still exist, though the've become rare. early March retired virologist spoke company, said, ‚Äúyou wearing masks.‚Äù I'm MS, see 99% mask usage. BUT, I've personally inside stores refuse entry mask. wife part job, reported closer 30% like you. said pretty much nobody Kroger stores around seem wear them. I'm mixed response myself. pretty outgoing person. I've BECOME real introvert COVID times...and I'm starting like it. I'm concerned looking forward reintroducing social activities safe. also agree lockdown. things absolute killers can‚Äôt stand see people life unemployed something simple like mask wearing. 

Good talk! Stay safe Thank Why? friend teaches Europe teachers wearing masks students arent required. MO since early May students went back. cut number cases isnt same, school district went back case rate similar FFX (if trends stay same) going back September. week FFX 7 day rolling average 50 cases/day county 1.2 million.

The one comment one union rep waiting vaccine absurd face. could never vaccine.  Thank Funny mention that. bad flu season kills 650k worldwide. would stop him?

And, clear, Congress seem interested mounting opposition.

How many politicians advocating safe remote solution voting? one voting rights activists really making case alternative format voting right now.

And worth pointing Dems make money, private business, Trump power. They'd lose fundraising won.

So I'm convinced trying win. makes sense. It‚Äôs scary makes sense. Thank responding. do? That‚Äôs interesting

As example, read China reports someone virus test positive symptoms.

The idiosyncrasies make apples apples comparisons difficult 

Cheers Please provide data back dubious assertions. Especially reference data shows young people fine

We long-term data available. Please provide data reference examine it. take Floridians demand recall vote? top vaccine every year certainly issue.

It is. Adenovirus vaccines development 30 years, vaccine went market rabies vaccine use animals. 2-dose lifetime limit also precludes annual top use case. best AZ vaccine stopgap better vaccine drawback adenovirus-vectored vaccines, general, one get maximum two doses lifetime; immune system could generate neutralising antibodies attack vector, said Dr Kathryn Edwards, professor paediatrics, Division Infectious Diseases, Vanderbilt University School Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. Perhaps different type vector could used second injection, first virologist noted. Even using different vaccine technology, like DNA plasmid vaccine, booster shot could considered, Curiel said. Exactly got ""Hillary leads 97-3 polls"" lol would assume everywhere southeast anecdotally say literally every summer camp area summer camps North Carolina well  happen use antivax arguments REALLY provax. Sure. Right Here‚Äôs one many articles little protests contributed rising numbers: may suck students (though, must keep mind, good others, like disabled students ones get anxiety public). however great world health grateful kids give typical college experience save lives. It‚Äôs tough say many city leaders instructed contract tracers ask anyone who‚Äôs tested positive COVID-19 whether recently attended demonstration. there‚Äôs really good data this.

Yes people going kids fall /s So, the:

""Winter mean COVID-19 transmission summer"" people now?  Oh agreed. absolutely confident eventually developed safe effective coronavirus vaccine. However little faith government (and small begin eroded tremendously,) absolute faith eventually productive grind science technological advancement. science way this. job refuse participate spread disease buy scientific machine time.

That confidence mean need confident safety evaluation process pressure accelerate beyond normal pacing might undermined, overseen agency already rushed making incorrect decision dearth evidence exists.

We totally get vaccine. totally rushing push one 6 months. still might ""the one"". also carries risks NORMAL vaccine development timeline would caught. 

I'm anti-vaxx anti-science acknowledging that. right, making point protesters SPECIFICALLY protesting wearing mask. Masks give people false sense security. see already protesters. keep claiming outside wearing masks, fine. widespread study shows cloth facemasks work better social distancing.

In reality, best way avoid spreading coronavirus social distancing. mask required. bread butter social distancing. required report abuses see proper authorities also held liable. report directly child care services supervisor police... union. still summer camp? disagree intentionally malicious. underestimate sheer scope Trump's narcissism. views everything purely terms affects particular moment. emotional development two-year-old, attention span match.

Like toddler, Trump fixates getting whatever make feel good right now. main thing makes feel good flattery. Trump needs believe always smartest one room. fragile ego can't handle idea Fauci, doctor, knows better him. damaged infantile brain can't comprehend virus could come nowhere wreck latest reality show.

So tries pretend nothing. Pretend magically go away. orders everyone around pretend things. none works, throws tantrums.

It 100% Trump's best interest listen Fauci. broken, childish, self-obsessed mind cannot grasp that. rollout healthcare professionals vulnerable populations. aware size scope phase 3 trials? likely months everyone keeps pretending dangerous. There‚Äôs European strain virus......even Chinese afraid it‚Äôs suspected strain responsible uptick China good answer stay home, business owners better long run customers still ground. Yeah. see Missouri sure. Gosh darn millennials! First take chili‚Äôs! eat avocado toast! HR director told ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt Italy‚Äù raised concerns her.

Now acts confused don‚Äôt say hello her. Anyone understand deaths surging despite increased cases? enough time passed yet? US safety trials Oxford

As long trial satisfies FDA standards isn‚Äôt true. Given large US market is, phase 3 trials countries often targeted FDA‚Äôs standards routinely approved use US. US UK governments funding Oxford vaccine lol real leader however would leading example, supplying adequate care/funding/supplies, prioritizing effective intervention, utilizing resources make easier us sending mixed messages us, like older people, still believe government acts good faith. sure, that‚Äôs problem he‚Äôs making lot worse needs be. whole world closed lulz?

Maybe look beyond US centric media realize *whole globe* locked down. importantly look beyond empathy human beings. 

So bars beaches get closed *one summer* sudden it‚Äôs *years* ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúentire lives‚Äù hold?

News flash: *everyone* thing. *all* sacrificed. You‚Äôre anyone else you‚Äôre ‚Äúyoung‚Äù.

God forbid sacrifice anything anyone else, amirite? go again. use 12 week lockdown nationally ramp mask production? need surgical N95 damp environments vs. construction N95. Deaths lagging indicator. Next couple weeks going good intend first injected vaccine, think something average person need worry about. 200 million people US billions world, enough vaccine go around while. 

It take months get enough vaccine make difference infection rate. example adherence guidelines priest still got it. cathedral required face masks worn attendees staff masses, addition maintaining social distancing.  part, grandchild? Hi, need guidance do.

I currently live TN (North Nashville) newborn. Husband deploying soon 2 months. family lives Wyoming checked county see 4 people remain active virus. looked RT.live saw Wyoming higher Rt value TN. husbands family, wear mask leave home except work, believe virus serious news makes be. planning go Wyoming duration husband‚Äôs deployment, feel I‚Äôd safer Wyoming cases one lowest country, nervous Rt value. still go Wyoming stay TN?

(We would driving staying camper travel portion would buy food use public restrooms) child oversight smaller groups schools daycares essential workers harder phase lockdown. Honestly, either. woman childbearing age 

As woman childbearing age, pretty low priority list. would think even opportunity get vaccine immediately? assumption privilege appalling. vaccine go health care workers vulnerable populations FIRST. wait rest us. Reasons why: (1) authoritarian governments wanting case numbers look bad (also applies extent US); (2) lack testing, (3) lack hospital access, period. Working hard....thanks I'm fortunate enough working, got problem forfeiting check allowed work get bigger chunk. considered, working without reduced hours eligible. Sucks cause like money others need right now. Amen. couple stores foraging food week didn‚Äôt see single douchebag. It‚Äôs become natural thing point, think people northeast smarter collective whole, understand inconvenience get us finish line much faster unable reconcile effect versus personal feelings. Vaccines take years develop perfect, one obviously rushed economic purposes... clear daylight Jaafar! seeing error ways

The errors sees ones influence much campaign funding gets reelection. It‚Äôs quite hard base wants everything stay open, base also risk. close, base calls weak, stay open base dies.

Hmmmmh yup at. famous rapper named Scarface says he's dialysis 3 months COVID.

 family Maine spent summers kid decades know ""from away"" mentality lol. coasts smothered trophy homes though. Well like think, bet Except everyone long term effects. may one unlucky ones trying convince doctors take complaints seriously peers back partying. point trading stop, literally won't. Anything US trade that's extent cheap migrant labor has. Traveling may heavily restricted that's it. midwest? Excuse me, lot midwest *not* problem. hotpot activity south nearer coasts. Same! lifelong NYC area resident (and living Manhattan) i'll say get bad rap. Yes cold way sidewalk, like put it, fell sidewalk would six people five seconds help up. see humanity neighbors choice look eye eye. Hard times amplify this. Seeing people different going thing. think missing less dense parts country. Goddammit. want live life travel, I'm perfectly fine abiding bio-hazard/contagion quarantine instructions tested tested+ help ensure international travel conducted safely. Fucking border laws insane, we're supposed inalienable right freedom movement. feel unjustly discriminated against, I'm one yahoos running around without mask. I'm trying, can't help rest world lost collective mind. disheartening say it, people reject vaccine let darwinism thing. 

Despite impending financial burden society survive might better off. understanding, even without complete immunity immune system definitely adapts extent. really don‚Äôt think people going get bad again. Black Americans accounted 42% HIV diagnoses 13% population. 

But stop donating that's discrimination. Exactly like anti-gay discrimination American Red Cross perpetuates. Deaths take three weeks. Compare cases deaths now. guess shouldn‚Äôt scared post main sub since posted much less followed sub yesterday ... however general readers sub consider information ultra mainstream sources finally NY Times started reporting eventually admit synthetic chimera virus escaped accidentally lab.

New Hampshire, need wear seat belt. penalty fly windshield die get bad enough accident. shamed coming

The responsibility churches adapt, expect good sense Christians. thing can't regulate still causing spikes people hosting large private events property spread like wildfire too.

True, point get community spread point incidences like negligible. Canadian Government agreed exempt ""in national interest"", long teams league present plan compensating controls quarantine. 7% lot... Yes told apply visa everything even though embassies closed currently issuing visas. Yeah maybe government something that... We're going find happens outbreak goes mostly unmitigated densely populated areas.

We already known Lombardy Italy.

It means loads people die. Arizona, Texas, Florida. governors Ohio, Michigan, Illinois good work. exceptions rule  method seems sound though. picked cities large protests early synthetic experimental group used cities large-scale protests synthetic control group. protests superspreading events, able see peak daily cases one mean incubation time happened.

There several issues study. Firstly, retrospective study always worse prospective study. also stands falls mathematical model used. I'm qualified check could well hot garbage. mathematical model also model, replicate reality certain extent. example, people travel cities, even pandemic. far see, way account that.

I think good chance protests mild spreading events. pleasantly surprised see many people wearing masks least trying keep distance. fact happened outside probably helped curb spread well. Still, protest large event thousands people. alone makes unlikely spread virus protests. Well, thought apt reply absolute bullshit, absolute bullshit statement.

Now, quiet put pacifier back in.  mindset hinges Herd Immunity, garbage concept applied people. look history see now:
1. 28% American population despite around 2 years 3 waves. 
2. Polio Measles plagued humanity decades mostly eradicated vaccines, despite infectious Spanish Flu COVID-19.
3. hard pressed convince rational person 60%-70% Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand get virus. Human behavior belief mathematical models, leads real outcomes.
4. Sweden's economy open productive hard lockdowns, flattened reduced. stay way people feel confident virus control. debatable that's better longterm strategy.
5. People get virus early guinea pigs. ""data"" epidemiologists follow. 1-2 years, vaccine not, much better idea treatments work doesn't. survival rate increase complication rate drop time learn more. argued people South younger, mistakes made Northeast save vulnerable population devastating outcomes learned (i.e. using certain steroids ventilators treatment). Fuck awful country American works home....what pants speak of? Craziness, airports extremely good screening here. analogy even work. like ""I dropped lit match living room, fault dumped gas room"". Shocking  Imagine unprepared would things run wild three months ago without lockdown part confused about?

Congress represent people. lead them. president's job. West valley I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs minimum 20% people given situation aren‚Äôt wearing mask. businesses strictly enforcing social distancing guidelines. People still don‚Äôt se,e understand virus transmitted infectious is. We‚Äôre fucked we‚Äôve fucked two weeks now. It‚Äôs late put genie back bottle. federal government refused provide fiscal aid states forced reopen despite data clearly suggesting early. Probably best. even uncommon story anymore? clusterfuck uptick... European lives Boston, New England come EU flight block stop travel diseased south? People clearly taking serious... Good tbh. No, federal seat belt law. Nice try.

OSHA deals commerce, empowered federal government interstate commerce clause. 

Any brain busters? dont forget claymore. feel like state would 60% none time, except go haircut it‚Äôs mandated salons barbers reopened must require masks. 

So wore mask last month got first post-COVID haircut, answered ‚Äúsome times.‚Äù Nice. makes proud European. Finally showing spine. Blood shelf life 8 weeks. even hold 90 days. Wow. utterly totally predictable. 

It‚Äôs sad. Guy see dad die taking seriously. :-(

I fear way it‚Äôs going go US till virus finally gone. 

Maybe enough heart felt messages finally sunk people start taking proper precautions. problem long keep infected zombies ""Trump virus"" - needs become term. Whenever someone mentions Gates conspiracy, think Mission Impossible II galls report matter fact attitude. NY catastrophe, Florida cataclysmic. sad aged badly. started careful overnight? Yes yes, Oxford, blah blah. sub telling Oxford + AstraZeneca, funded UK, US, CEPI, Gavi, Oxford itself. mean shit, Johnson &amp; Johnson lied us years baby powder. going trust brand new mRNA vaccine?

[Here's (partial) real list bet susceptible government influence cases government providing funding.

* Moderna, funded US gov
* CanSino, funded (probably?) Chinese government
* Inovio, funded US government CEPI
* BioNTech / Pfizer, self funded??
* Oxford / AstraZeneca, funded UK, US, CEPI, Gavi
* Novavax, funded US gov CEPI
* Merck, funded US gov
* Johnson &amp; Johnson, funded US gov
* Sanofi / GlaxoSmithKline, funded US gov

How much trust Pfizer, AstraZenaca, Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline operating Operation Warp Speed? f\*ck something up, they'll get immunity government they'll set pathetic fund paying pennies class action lawsuits. means nobody going homes document abuse mandatory reporters aren‚Äôt seeing usual charges regular basis. bullshit. store enter 30% compliance best heard over. truly far gone. schools reopen person classes fall it‚Äôs going even worse disaster see now. Side-stepped question.... yeah, use passport flyling.

source: dual citizen this. I'd think would want post immediately inform people may want get tested guess point easier wait symptoms testing supplies getting maxed out. Agree 100%. going proxy states figure live alongside CV. guess like everyone else gut instinct says things get dicey manage deal ok healthcare settings. 

It's pretty mind boggling think current surge could exponentially smaller everyone wore fookin $1 mask. no. Apprently mask use badge political affiliation politics important human suffering lives. Ny/NJ/CT requiring mandatory 2 week quarantine people coming high risk states know else problem? Dying coronavirus. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôd much rather collectively confront mental health problems created temporary isolation fight bigger social safety nets risk low- income populations wave away virus ‚Äúlittle cough‚Äù. life death situation many imo, things listed ‚Äúdestabilizing‚Äù much better options burying family members. Thanks. sounds absolutely stupid. would border guard flag said went Alaska never got border crossing? Somebody‚Äôs got first use vaccine part large group confirm safety effectiveness general public.

Might well - kids, won‚Äôt get pregnant, health insurance vaccine undiscovered rare side effects. Older old, reasonably healthy aside couple covid risk factors like weight blood type.

I work public place 1.2 million visitors per year. I‚Äôm willing take risk new vaccine haven‚Äôt already caught then. Nursing homes careful since know deadly virus exists kills age group don‚Äôt even know say could wrong.

Working Americans voted overwhelmingly safety nets, 2016 biggest divide history. You‚Äôll allowed student visa long program still meeting person. Start process get FBI background check apostille Secretary State operating slow, they‚Äôve processing mine 4 weeks (usually takes 4 days). What? It‚Äôs always funny someone speaks ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù it‚Äôs one place people easily described. 

Sure I‚Äôve read states/cities fairing various attitudes masks. However Bay Area/San Francisco almost everyone outside wearing mask, folks stayed home, people mostly trust local government, etc. cases continue low. Long-standing treaty. Also, guaranteed part original agreement US pay almost entire cost original construction Alaska Highway passes Canada, Canada essentially got free major roadway connecting Yukon Northern BC southern BC Alberta. Welcome third film Snake Plissken trilogy, *Escape US*. more.to immunity antibodies. body keep antibodies every possible infection forever would absurdly inefficient. body memory cells trigger production antibodies needed. interesting. good know. 

We European cruise booked we‚Äôve since cancelled, REALLY can‚Äôt go. saying we're going put 4.5k patients nursing homes lose knowledge gained 6 months virus treatment? happened overnight. rate deaths significantly yesterday every day it. wonder ""chance death serious injury"" statistics skewed changes behavior due C19, least short term... I‚Äôm pissed. Listen, misinformation bad time like this. think warrants little rough language 6 months pandemic people adequate free time look actual facts statistics put scientists experts. It‚Äôs willful ignorance. never will. Presymptomatic asymptomatic. Asymptomatic people may never room show symptoms. According people likely spread virus, since shedding. depends part. Westchester County (with lot people pre-COVID commuted NYC daily work)? Mask wearing taken seriously.

Go north/west Capital Region lot stores talk good talk masks required enter zero enforcement wearing in, require masks (despite executive order people must wear masks public).

They see immune lower risk ""we're spread NYC""... pin totally DeBlasio large sense things need open long done safely. 

There still going plenty offices people coming 100% need can't see Cuomo DeBlasio interfering private business force I‚Äôm fine that, I‚Äôm worried passing husband daughter inside house. ‚ÄúI responsible burning 35% body. It‚Äôs responsibility compensate 65% that‚Äôs left.‚Äù

Do know stupid sound? Lucky t-cells seem long lasting then. Americans demanded government treated well large &amp; small businesses would chance. 

The stimulus passed joke. due twisted political landscape called socialism help fellow man stimulus keep capitalism afloat.

Newsflash, nobody going buy anything many tens thousands new cases day. Tourism effectively dead country, we're quickly losing world standing. world going move without us we're fighting amongst scraps. We‚Äôll secure barn door horses exited I‚Äôm fully board - like complain sometimes... Lol cares. One problems shortage masks. March store N95 dust masks surgical masks sold out. People resigned without unless fabricated home, believe me, many guys handy making anything fabric. Even today, go Walmart, 'no masks yet, maybe next week', CVS, 'sorry, sold out'. 

By state federal governments priority making sure everyone masks.  Every store walk stack masks right hand sanitizer station.

At beginning WWII every citizen England issued gas mask. safety masks here, IMO. Swapping spit social distancing. may rise cases, think part due overall testing well. Correct I'm wrong, think last week 10k+ tests done week day. (In May, Washington 5k-6k day cases ranged 200-300) So, increase 50% test probably something this. endgame. people barely think day future. sub reminds futurology subreddit. useful hosting interesting information, always went overstate worst possible outcome.

If guess intellectual friends may thinking ... 

1) risks on-par life specific virus -- 80% population.  
It's 10X less deadly originally assumed. We've learned lot since March.

2) say ""there specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit."" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director WHO. 

Some say purpose avoid PPE shortages, that's part it, say ""we recommend"" went said ""no evidence."" assume either ""lied,"" told truth caving public pressure, wrong incompetent. 

I get contradictory information - petri dish images (with Bacteria Covid). truthfully, someone poured literature, 0 studies prove size benefit masks similar viruses impacting outcomes population. also studies potential harm people underlying conditions, millions.

There several studies (as well logic) shows masks reduce droplets &amp; aerosol particles 40-95% depending mask type, need 1 virion, small 40 nanometers get infected. even reducing 90% particles may enough meaningfully impact transmission rates.

There really two studies closet thing I've found -- comprehensive one showed \~10% impact transmission, undetermined delays guess moral story ... rational minds disagree masks even whether social distancing worth depending age/context. Whether someone inconsiderate around someone else uncomfortable, another story. I'd evaluate one within context vs. using broad brush one. bad I'm considering wearing mask public permanently. fact bad I'm wearing respirator fear immune. Delta fantastic airline family. Definitely worth every penny extra, normally much extra. estimates bit suspect. NY outbreak least fatality rate estimated 1%. rate know least 5% infected need hospitalization hospitals get overrun many people might die.

### ABSTRACT

### Background

Cutaneous manifestations COVID‚Äê19 disease yet fully described.

### Objectives

To describe cutaneous manifestations COVID‚Äê19 disease hospitalized patients.

### Methods

We examined cutaneous manifestations 210 hospitalized patients.

### Results

Cutaneous findings observed COVID‚Äê19 infection 52 patients. Lesions may classified erythematous scaly rash (32.7%), maculopapular rash (23%), urticarial lesions (13.5%), petechial purpuric rash (7.7%), necrosis (7.7%), enanthema apthous stomatitis (5.8%), vesicular rash (5.8%), pernio (1.9%) pruritus (1.9%). Cutaneous manifestations observed statistically significantly certain age groups: patients 55 64 65 74‚Äâyears age complained cutaneous manifestations age groups. gender, significant difference male female patients terms cutaneus findings. relationship comorbidity dermatological finding status statistically significant. relationship increases linearly according comorbidities. According statistical results patients hospitalized intensive care unit higher risk cutaneous findings due COVID‚Äê19 infection.

### Conclusions

With study may highlight importance overlooked dermatological findings patients hospitalized. Japan also version CDC lie masks.  Three card Monte. factor young employees working restaurants.

The math simple: employee spends 40 hours week working restaurant 40 times likely infected restaurant patron visits 1 hour week. Found pro-China puppet. Fuck Chinese government. That‚Äôs works. all. They‚Äôre different strains. logic humans gorillas they‚Äôre apes already seeing people get disease once. means natural antibodies might enough keep safe. protesters smart, tearing George Washington statues? also want tear Abe Lincoln Jesus Christ statues ‚Äúmuh racist‚Äù. Outdoor bars opened 2 weeks ago. Go river North, gold coast, Lincoln Park, etc. Packed masks. Says random guy internet. experience area law? Holy shit.. sub turned typical reddit propaganda sub now? entire state 25% hospital beds they're still hitting record highs cases. denial mind. saying cause major surge. know 40x said, British intelligence noted much. 185,360 likely deaths 3,339,000 infections.

But got control aren‚Äôt let happen again.

They know bad taking gravely seriously attacking, ignoring, new infections.

Meanwhile America probably right 180,000 deaths include excess pneumonia cases, 20,000,000-30,000,000 cases based serology studies.

I know death rates don‚Äôt match up, ton unknown got sick died.

But know governments around world now, it‚Äôs telling see lengths China willing go. Clearly minor wish were. Government machine broke. Time scrap get new one. #eattherich Really sucks living right using DALYs, make sense people passed grade school I'm nursing student working senior home glasses fog terribly, hard anything! especially hard touching face time adjust them! Yesterday, went eye doc gave best advice! Take top mask turn towards nose, turn downwards bit like making upside J little hook inside. bend metal bit make seal per normal. works really well paper masks! Sensationalizing virus like yelling kid get street truck comes speeding toward him/her. Sometimes it‚Äôs necessary. sooner stop equating poverty stupidity (like article does) better. dont need money fight virus- need people act selflessly- US never able respond effectively. Everything bigger Texas death rate won‚Äôt exactly everywhere New York likely outlier terms fatality. 

Someone said best elsewhere thread - New York got slammed hard fast, result New York essentially testing ground lot treatments protocols, well tragically finding (early intubation, etc). 

We know New York going worst it, knowledge going help fatality rate. 

This virus serious, every death tragedy. also extremely important hospitals get overwhelmed NY, doubt negatively affects fatality rate.

But can‚Äôt point New York proof virus higher fatality rate likely does, it‚Äôs fair comparison. end day, ensuing decades research likely going conclude New York outlier fatality rates complicated set circumstances. workers go back Starbucks get lattes.

You: 1

Strawman: 0 That‚Äôs lot autoimmune disorders work well. Basically pretty high percentage people living immune system Joker Killing Joke. Well, guess name try line reasoning next cop pulls seat belt see goes. can't force take safety precaution. people's kids, man. went mom's either day. say lawn stayed porch wore masks. ""Here possible reasons: "" greed, ignorance, political corruption, religious zealots, willful misinformation, sociopathy. forever, good treatment I‚Äôm taking Florida bar exam end July. room 1500 people. Masks required, temperature checks, we‚Äôll social distancing much can. I‚Äôm little worried (obviously). best masks wear 8 hours? protections take? Canadians obsessed ""freedumb"" love man. would require able pass high school business class, course happen. 

Hell, even MagaMasks would sell great, would ""I WEAR MASK LIBBY MONSTER"" masks.  lot areas never really onboard begin with. That's kinda problem  state informed masks mandatory Fall. One teachers replied union email proudly proclaiming won‚Äôt wear mask governor dictator. September gonna blast Also best methods (contact tracing) would never really work USA due obsession privacy, people lie sick avoid unknown phone calls. I‚Äôll explain it:


The death rate increases variables age/health/hospital capacity. Also, math wrong, it‚Äôs 0.21% NYC died. 

Serology tests indicate 25% NYC gotten virus *as April*. certainly increased now, 40%, 50%, 60%? don‚Äôt know. 

Sooooo, virus ravaged city already killed lot high risk residents. rest NYC gets virus, overall death rate could close 0.26% since lot high risk population already died. Mcmahon got last laugh aka Owen Hart. Consider checking status here: also FAQs. Perhaps check status old new address see one shows delivered. would weigh whether completely collapsed healthcare system massively reduced lifespan worth it. Saying ‚Äúwe would accept risk‚Äù easy, accepting hospitals constantly hopelessly overrun take kid burst appendix people dying Medicare age lot harder ‚Äòaccept‚Äô. looters saw youtube wore masks t-shirts around face people videotaping. don‚Äôt want get caught. lol black folks treated cops? problem false news. People made believe dont care people dont wear mask. Well Garuntee people comenting feeling proud selves clue proper way wear mask. mention things one needs make wearing mask make sense. asked many people claim educated none able answer correctly. 

1.How often change mask.
2. take mask dispose it.
3. wash hands using mask.

If cant answer without looking like people wearing precious mask make feel better. Masks sick. hasnt changed. started treating everyone like sick. Wearing mask life style choice. stop trying force life style choices others treat like dont care people dont wear one. probably handful things could considered caring people. Better 0 evidence protests cause sounds right honestly. can‚Äôt find articles outside one agree I‚Äôve gotta think that‚Äôs result multiple violations live arizona awesome. happened Singapore/Wuhan? late start using masks? Something else?

Singapore initially really low caseload, something clearly pwnt them. /s .................................. Sure thing, buddy.  technically headache neurological problem skipping morning cup joe cause neurological problems. far, hospitalizations increasing lot slower cases are. deaths even slower that.

It's incredibly reasonable assertion say ""the outbreaks seen southern southwestern US expected less severe per case ones Northeast March April."" data supports it, would expect given much medical knowledge improved last three months. 


Now, issue is, \*it's lot death outbreak all.\* would option areas without lot general fucknuttery. also believe death rate lower 1%, never argued I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre bringing ‚Äúim gunna nut right heeeeerrrrrreeeeee‚Äù deaths decreasing now. Also important remember recently we've seen cases start increasing again. Since deaths lag weeks may mean could see deaths rise July/August leader idiot think Florida Oklahoma would listening smarter president? would still opened state controls decisions government. 1 guy Scottsdale = 3k cases day. Youre totally right keep listening CNN ignoring medical experts watch see number viewpoints relation HCQ may possible treatment also preventitive drug treatment. None viewpoints conclusive, none claim either. 

Dr William O'Neill studying HCQ Remdesiver - sees HCQ much beneficial, jumping concrete conclusions, because, says; going lot smarter end summer, would say eveyone is, hold powder.

Maybe whole push Remdesiver purely money driven. There's certainly increasing pile evidence / anectodal suggest that. maybe, rush find answers fast, missing opportunity discover truth - whether malice mistake, result same. ...and meaningful lockdown use masks. Sorry sound aggressive, seems pretty bad.

So union member want? Then, what's point one? engagement within union abysmal bribes thrown leaders? covid tho happen virus state never ceases surprise me. Come Southern CA. Bars!? north/SF Bay Area still bars, in-restaurant dining, haircuts, gyms. south? :( That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù. Pandemic seasonal influenza different beasts least cooking kills SARS-2, right? Oof, viral meningitis 20 years ago. still remember headache inability stop throwing up. spinal tap pleasant either. case cleared pretty quickly though; 3 days hospital 1.5 weeks resting home. Good! business disobey social distancing need fined shutdown. Maybe vaccine comes, try rebuild business. Serves right. sounds fucking awful we're cool hundreds thousands needless deaths. Wow. Meanwhile US we've almost totally unfettered travel open across 50 states (well least 48 contiguous). People lazy. Pandemic perfect excuse level cooking skills. 

Unless I'm going somewhere really nice totally different style cooking, usually find worth go out. also finished clinical trial ya Actually prior protest, broke gate fucking governors mansion. 

One arrest made teargas rubber bullets. 

Also allowed open carry without cited. Seems like vast majority non-mask wearers area either teenagers/early 20s 65. agree notion understatement time significantly dangerous overstatement. One time lady kid barf one bowls casually handed handle. People go sick dont care spread staff. Good. hope severe violators put business. sorry employees, consequences. People get another job, people cannot get another life. Nearly 100! read article it‚Äôs talking hospitalized patients say take 7 days per however many days spent hospital recover. Patients extensive lung scarring never get back 100%, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs high b percent people?

The actual quote ‚Äúthe fear never getting better real‚Äù talking patients frustrated long recovery taking, it‚Äôs saying aren‚Äôt ever getting better, topic title takes woe context. phone unfortunately sluggish mobile check real numbers.

This interesting. need look further. I'm sure bunch deaths people covid actually die No, include asymptomatic cases. CDC ‚Äúbest estimate‚Äù cases symptoms 0.4% Thanks, attorney..but crim law going bar study memory. agree attorney could argue first amendment, also agree wouldn‚Äôt viable argument. I‚Äôve seen lot baseless claims get courtroom door. five states make difference. People northeast arent going change live based happens texas sure friend's credit score impacted care less he's foreigner. transaction US fly-in, stay wife's relatives, go hospital delivery, apply passport etc. point transactions credit score play role. Unless course plans start living US point renting applying loan pretty good life back home. Every civilized country took care citizens without second thought. U.S. government worried pockets idea terrifies (if get sick it), bad idea. governors would likely panic suddenly healthcare workers. New York paying nurses - around 40K/month point travel help? say Corona made believer man, praise lord! 20 bucks cdc running mainframe adhoc pos system 80s. sorry loss, friend!

Each every day see children‚Äôs smiling faces, even days they‚Äôre grouchy pains ass, motivate push little bit more. I‚Äôve days bad didn‚Äôt kids here, honestly don‚Äôt know would motivation keep pushing through. don‚Äôt want children ever feel ‚Äúheld them‚Äù feel weight burden...that‚Äôs it. greatest joy present every moment children‚Äôs lives long able! greatest motivation!

I believe mother looking great pride love, appreciation ways showed love support here. Hugs you. I'm arguing schools stay closed. nuanced ""more testing"", suggestion look drastic separation ""school usual masks"" daily testing looking like option August. might tell want hear! Truth. already happened times know started, like started notice somethin wrong know hard time getting people go seminary generally clergy really old really young - mostly older I've seen (traditional Catholic family). last rights important Catholics priests even they're danger. lot criticism comes Catholicism doubt resolve. Look case trajectory EU versus US. That's absurd consider opening schools without masking. Mostly time lag diagnosis death. contributions from: relevant hospitals continuing provide decent care (maybe much longer . . .), improved hospital management severe cases yet respirator, cases skewing somewhat younger, minor effects under-reporting COVID deaths respiratory distress/in hospital, . . .  
It would nice know whether there's better management new outbreaks nursing home. seen evidence. point, effect vulnerable people already died, that's likely \~50% people already expose. know someone already mentioned this, really piece shit. thought experiment: 

Bars social places. Drinking. Talking. Etc. 

Now wearing masks proven effective not. 

But drinking (or eating) requires removal mask. 

Bars also noisy. People tend lean shout din. Probably 
since one drinking, removed said mask. 

Also, drinking (alcohol) tends lower inhibitions therefore judgement. 

All said, explain mechanics bar coronavirus exist time? sounds profoundly dangerous. I'm familiar FDAs clinical trials process, releasing something public use early scary. bars clubs aren‚Äôt allowed open final phase... along high capacity venues. Hell, casinos fully open bars can. anyone thinks bar among first things reopen beyond people would call great job.... I'm sure get idea Seven Country Study fabricated. study involved scientists worldwide. doubt involved huge conspiracy deceive public. observational cohort study. going control like clinical trial. Countries chosen wide range dietary intakes. compared different diets health outcomes. results study informed promotion Mediterranean diet, low saturated fat. ethics problem American science. Keep updated please! think he'll risk shutting down. health advisor got death threats. knows save face out. reverses position starts shuttin again, every gun owning Trumper storm Columbus. DeWine right thing first time around, can't see again. Imported pop - that's fact.

Further, doubt imported (unless ""imported"" Wuhan) abroad. China complete lockdown soon virus spread Europe. claim spread via salmon Norway whatever absurd. isn't, hell wrong hygenical routines country, spread like allowed happen even complete lockdown know what's play?

As well-populated countries hard 100% contain sort virus, proof virus [reached even first confirmed even exist Chinese government - seriously doubt initial Wuhan containment/quarantine managed stop spred within China. would trust claim example New Zealand, would absolutely trust claim Chinese government. last decades they've worked hard stifling free speech (Gui Minhai prime example) they've worked stifling virus spread last months, claim virus imported - foolish trust claim blindly. Trumps Travel Ban! YOLO rise reopening. pretty easy see protests happened everywhere, seeing spikes states opened earlier. fact know virus develop EXACTLY reason need stop now, rather pray blindly it'll mutate something benign. realise viruses mutate infectious variants survive? guess what, claiming best let nature take course idiotic reason pandemics like occur regularly measures taken (vaccination) prevent infection first place. course know certain global outcome event, unprecedented. ludicrous condemn lives evidence making public health effort impact. i'm sure willing give life something could done it. FrEeDoM FiRsT MenDmAnt.... didnt know that. thanks. Same. ""You can't trust anything media says.""

Ok, well anything anyone posts Facebook? ::Two thumbs up:: Soros pay people wear masks bet you‚Äôd need $100/month Lol, Americans clearly wanted him, would gotten elected otherwise?

That‚Äôs roll eyes someone says ‚Äúonly 0.05% population died‚Äù. Defunding education making ""ivory tower elites universities"" enemy help either. Ah, word leftist then? That's really sad Kentucky, people wearing masks part smiled nodded store, gave lots extra space. Even though wearing masks, seemed understand worried getting sick respected that. One man even waited bit leave aisle could pass without getting close avoid making uncomfortable. would hate receiving kind open hostility describing. see kind people unkind people here. Everyone voted also blame. Protests him. told truth would cause irreparable harm political party serve propaganda tool for.

Okay lot unpack comment, I'm gonna respond part Applebee's stay business pick 3 $40 meal $5 bottle bud enticing pick 3 $14.99 $2.75 bottles bud mean may outrageous think folks would still willing come cheaper price bill say 15% service fee tip. 

$15 $40 ~165% price increase. That's pretty outrageous really productive consider conversation. would fully expect anywhere makes kind increase go business, TBH, good riddance Applebee's. cost would need go 30% cover expected loss tipped income, could easily change 3/$20 $3.50 beers without changing profit margins, IMO sounds like fine deal anywhere US. 

However, primary problem service fee/tipping models deceitful. People come see low advertised price! that's actually cost, reality need fork another 15-30%, easy end spending expected. Yes, customer *should* account ordering, damn easy forget looking menu, restaurant industry absolutely knows this, uses advantage. restaurants 20-30 servers night. go $2.13/hr pay, lets say federal minimum wage whatever fucking ridiculously low wage, state $7.25, adding lot added cost store. prices higher even little, staff full minimum wage workers offense anyone making minimum wage saying get pay come play here. Serving fucking easy anyone never done bet pressed make weekend shift Sunday brunch almighty entitled church crowd comes rolling in. keep good staff pay hourly stay means keep adding price.

I've busser, I've worked kitchen, I've served tables. know industry well. easy people jerks. Removing customers ability hang tip head dance would go loooong way reduce toxicity.

Beyond that, scenarios discussing, servers would suddenly dropped minimum wage. would still earn 10-15% (or more?) sales. 

Example: Sell $1,000, keep $100, add hourly ( 7.25*6) = $143 six hour shift. That's almost $24/hour! I've offered engineering jobs lower rate that. 

I'm Colorado minimum (and tipped) wage lot better federal. Here, tipped min wage fixed $3.02 minimum wage currently $12/hour (making tipped $8.98) tied CPI, increases annually. still thriving restaurant industry, despite wages *much* higher federal. frankly, knowing possible higher service wages, think places stuck past adapt reason add flat percentage service fee trying find alternative tipping culture, still passing cost customer way stay business, reasonable competitive without adding extra cost bottom line. Customers feel like tip would gripe added 15% felt still getting good value meal decent service think us expect normal sit restaurant.

I see argument use idea transitioning, cannot support final goal. understand many customers LIKE able use tip bargaining chip, increasing menu price would achieve financial result, it? Especially enact regulation around this, one place use old model keep competitive advantage. percentage goes server imo. Bussers, kitchen staff already tied higher hourly salary rate restaurants, bussers may tipped server wants expected. bussers making minimum wage interact guest often. Kitchen staff never get tipped unless server feels like it. stance within scenario. start chopping 15% fee smaller percentages server guys going make whole lot. Selling $1,000 night good shift one server normal priced place. Thats $100 great dinner shift imo. take $70-$80 gonna enough good serving staff.

It's stance money coming tips/service fee/commision related busy restaurant is, much employee interacts customers. bar/busser/kitchen need work harder business restaurant, see increased wage time like servers do. 

I earned tipped wage received percent sales busser, system always made appreciate busy days knew going walk away more. get bonus place full, sure felt motivated hustle faster. see causing many complications

I could accept answer masks expensive use everyday.

That's true. saying us Vegas people vote her. Deaths naturally lagging indicator due course illness. Median time death showing symptoms something like 22 days add onto another 4-7 days actually make way hands AZDHS reporting.

Like things, see people loud obnoxious.
 
I saw huge groups people drinking BBQ acting like corona thing. masks, distancing, responsibility all.
 
But even though everyone saw idiot wearing masks, hard see real percentages, since everyone quarantining staying inside - can't see them.
 

I pondering bit driving.  seems way works.  irresponsible selfish fucks, partying up, get sick, reason they'll survive hospital capacity them, specifically people followed rules stayed safe would've also rather fun acting like idiots.
 
such life, guess. SPED teachers professors incredibly important students parents need them. Auto mod got upset saying really think comment general suffice say think terrible person touch generally unpleasant. changing narrative?

A lot cases connected religious gathering. way back Fabruary, Shincheonji Church infected thousands people South Korea.

Religions also created mass spread Iran France.

The lower deaths probably doctors got better treating covid patients.

Neverhtheless, deaths rise steeply US Deaths lag new cases 2 weeks. takes time sick die.

In case health system gets overwhelmed, real possibility Florida, Texas, Arizona, deaths rise lots more. 

There benefits better treatments, cannot treat sick. would love know one antibody studies. stopped entirely. Georgia door door look forward to. Trump says hes tons testing. Maybe includes antibody. Idk. Cold, Wet, properly sanitizing. No, reason offering shoes shirts. would stop that. Especially mean thread/sub. Come now, google it. Look worldometer numbers. Check CDC.

Deaths per million: US 387, Italy 575. already back March. keep up. saying vaccine unlikely threaten violence? Bill, people stupid even reject actual reality. Agreed counts..point Idk notion irresponsible ones relatives Europe... Ironic since Europe infected U.S. first place likely many Covid deaths.

Or indirectly related. Maybe hospitals different canada, US kind shit show areas entire hospitals devoted covid told avoid ER unless absolutely due covid risk. personally went without medical care things normally would due covid (I might need finger broken reseat it, great), imagine others done similar. 

Very often people heart attacks think indigestion something, entirely possible thought instead stay home due covid died instead. feeling lot deaths people avoided care whether fear catching virus, thought hospitals incapable helping time, whatever was. NYC lot extra deaths well explain testing negative covid, one best explanations come people get care hospitals swamped died home something like heart attack.

Then real question becomes: count people died indirectly due covid? would lived covid existing, covid kill even catch it? Many would argue yes. that‚Äôs late already. 9000 cases became symptomatic infections 1-2 weeks ago. number higher week even shutdown. like trying squeeze many elective procedures possible list certain seats. hard do. greed Political processes take time. particular, 27 involved parties. course, one looks reporting including US list countries never table. took time deciding short list (the lists dictated numbers longer) figuring handle China. Okay no. It‚Äôs state state. several failing states giving country shameful name right now. 

HOWEVER, 

No. Half states (NY, PA, CT, MASS,VERMONT, etc etc pretty detailed opening phases plans. New cases (mostly) opening planned pretty thoroughly. Masks mandated stages officers hired police social distancing. good plans, I‚Äôm sorry live south tho. Man fucking blows. right thing do, fuck I'm disappointed fellow citizens. I'm long distance relationship, meant see May obviously happen know we'll see other. might go year seeing that's unimaginable me. told channeling Bill Hicks: alternate route wasn‚Äôt MS can‚Äôt speak qualifications state, historically surprise me. husband product Madison schools. personal preference friends products Madison schools work veteran teachers M.Ed‚Äôs must popular veteran teachers. Well, AMD fact slowly make dangerous practices safe.

Fast slow matter someone getting stabbed heart. result end.

Some things cannot safely reopened things control matter hard pretend safely. could year everything 'steady'. No, authority pass legislation.

The authority regarding masks lies states. really debate matter. Sad friend wants travel completely understand Europe needs this. Majority Americans stupid-a fellow American please show proof statements? difficult time singling better man?

It *possible,* still unlikely, may small subset people become chronically infected, like Hepatitis B. think people really long clearance viral debris actively infected. said chose unemployment. same? Lol Honestly, could care less candidate folks choose represent you, American affects indirectly. 
To fair, vote somewhere center Dutch political spectrum, would probably classified somewhere left Lenin American. policy gets enacted currently policy driving country steep cliff. Like not, global economy affects rest us, we're going need quarantine country next year so. honest one family members infected, would rather got discovered right away put designated location proper medical care, undergo half-ass self-quarantine family members infect everyone near them. Hi nice meet youÔøº I'm surprised people small island communities paranoid end scale. Sounds like one bigger tourist destinations like Wilmington? Either way obnoxious. let children die hunger

You know obliged give money right? saying like asking feed every poor child, something attempting anyway attempts eradicate poverty. Also, license useless Anyway- versions things like MS Word, Excel available. know.

At first funny watching what's happening America.

But I'm starting get worried guys. Donors much power back Definitely worth renewing soon. lot passports, even take photo home now. icu short staffed daily need nurses go covid units. Went today, saw alarming number people wearing ""mouth"" masks. think nose overrated COVID condition. Hi friends. I‚Äôm going get face shield go along mask, since I‚Äôm safe possible traveling soon move leased room. recommendations sturdy one? Lots options amazon, rather buy something falls apart. Thanks. hope you‚Äôre right! I‚Äôll need look more. would make sense anyways, totally board banning tourism travel Really? poll like completely wrong. wish true. Yeah call bull. go ANYWHERE I‚Äôm seeing like 25% mask wearing.

Course, I‚Äôm North Florida, soooo Vietnam 100% closed foreigners unless you‚Äôre diplomat. case okay spend month quarantine military hospital go ahead. try leave normal IV catheters get irritated days. would new IV time infuse, need nurse that. never said take away! agree you. would hippocrate say given past history junkie myself. need harm reduction approach rather that, drugs. Wow...well guess won‚Äôt allow foreign citizens either here. Good day ya. even sure say this... think looks reside. double check. It‚Äôs small vocal group, even experts anything medicine related.

Calling dozen random scientists ‚Äúmany Swedish medical experts‚Äù really stretching truth. Great PR Las Vegas. Casinos closed right now. go. Period. put people's lives risk. Stay home. mean, we‚Äôre still banning even though way fewer cases us no, reciprocating completely unsurprising Kevin? favorite someone suggested inject bleach smoke UV light

What happened tried comrade? officially sound stupid. Covid 19 again, far list life threatening issues Black people.
Pork Chops bourbon far dire. Weirdo. chooses billionaire include word metro so, again, I'm sure derived everything beyond expressly stated. Three Gorges real danger, think front page?

You mean like Coronavirus? made public information? I'd say that's different traveling low risk country high risk country endangers you, going high risk country low risk country endangers everyone country visiting.

Of course, go one way go other. would support mandatory quarantine upon return low risk country case. Actually I'd support replacing travel bans mandatory quarantine, paid traveler necessary. would also discourage travel unimportant reasons. certainly Arizona it. one states somehow managed surpass 'Rona-'Zona? Arizona maybe us mean it‚Äôs good idea. People stay home protests got violent. Arizona states curfews. 

This probably explains surging cases young people didn‚Äôt stay home went protests. Now, cases applied protests, fact 2-3 weeks seeing surges young people leads believe contraCted from
Protests. Explain AZ, Texas, Florida compared northern states. I'd put onus government here. Plenty countries handled competently even get point discussing mask truthers. People always going ignorant selfish, that's constant, really expect better institution that's supposedly protecting us. Perfectly said. live AZ governor decided reopen, salons, barbershops, restaurants, bars, gyms, casinos, malls movie theaters allowed open within space week, starting 5/8. governor called ""slow, phased reopening"". Truly baffling.
People rushed back anywhere open, behaved though nothing ever happened everything normal again. friends went 2 restaurants day around week first opened up. guess found necessary make lost time, something. I'm sure people support restaurants continuing curbside pickup, delivery. No, ""experience"" eating out, consequences damned. 
Now we're predictably surging, badly, hospitals struggling. places still open, aside businesses made responsible decision close again. would give award one give. assuming would take one front runners (Oxford, moderna) find way call US. mean many people understand ACA Obamacare thing. I've also heard people think Trump personally sent checks take much. Realistically seeing symptoms severe enough protests majority tested, count first/2nd gen infections. However, go seed infections elsewhere severe. know guy SF tested positive got GF, got roommate went protested. He's 3rd gen infection. Channel 4 really good show called smuggled people literally smuggle people UK really easily straight border patrol. Lmao hospital capacity, capacity expand it, mean doing! Winning virus defined hospitals overflowing. intentional. 

Looking you, Florida. Muh freedumbs No, forever. thought outside Please add too, situation Europe/S. America would definitely also gotten rid federal oversight forward enforcement. *puts big ass mirror* Fat lot good lights now, huh? American trusts Chinese government owned media? Yikes. get used it. horribly phobic IVF (shit ons needles), even inject myself, thanks reminder need get shot fridge. agree trigger mechanism cosentyx autoinjector fucking sucks?

There tons resources overcoming phobias, would strongly encourage look them, downright easier world injections less traumatic. [Incredible podcast PI3-kinase cancer (amongst general Spain remote workers. all, spend money without taking jobs.

I havent looked paper yet idea true interesting point.

I many friends left apartments since riots looting protests started areas people get pulled cars beaten. Fuck crazy person. Learn type. Right can't even take seriously. careful. it‚Äôs rushed Europe risks. Remember thalidomide? Europe allowed it, FDA said no. tests equals less cases"" big brain

Is true comrade? mean 'Police States America'? far 'United', trust me. every day absolutely living hell CFS. predict new Onion article ""\`No way prevent this\` says nation regularly happens"" Putin happy EU reopen 18 countries, US amongst them? Oh no, Putin won! benifits COVID's effects international travel, played right hands! Americans using ""Alaska loophole"". We've Americans getting fined Banff. Saying travelling Alaska obviously (they supposed follow specific  ""He also chooses billionaire""


Nvm this, however. Azim Premji billionaire too. Texan here. whole family pissed wife, kid stayed home go step-neices graduation party/bbq throwdown relatives allllll major metro areas. said ""disappointed missed large gathering family."" proud Trumpers. Nevermind fact two-person food truck anyone gets COVID, we're shut would likely go under. Yeah, I'm selfish... Bars also loud, means people going either speak loudly, get closer someone heard. Speaking loudly going put particulates air.  great people can‚Äôt handle invited party anymore. Fairfax County insanely high COVID cases compared rest State. blame them. hover around maybe 200 cases county Fairfax 13,000. Arlington Alexandria bad. heard lots people walking around proud without masks social distancing all. 

SO glad left area. flu season 13 weeks. Could imagine flu season never let Spring continued summer? mean, works too. people paid work could given duties, works fine me. stay put miserable homes

If home miserable, understandable want stay in?

Also said family Poland Polish passport well American one allowed entry Europe Polish passport ""but masks useless virus hoax"" daily running average positive cases Houston/Harris County past week 250 per day testing positive, supposed huge outbreak? county 4 million people 250 much fact many say average 300-350 per day previous weeks. Yup currently living Tennessee moment. stopped smoking 10 years ago realized still feel high. anything. North Carolina general always travesty depends visa.

Also European states issuing extensions visas permits didn‚Äôt read respond actual comment. relating anything said. really worth it. One mom's friend also thought exist 3 weeks ago. said regular virus less serious flu know anyone gotten it. Last weekend daughter went Vegas cousin ER 3 times week. mom hospital yesterday get xrays lungs confirmed positive well. Literally 5 people house infected now. 

She called mom crying last night begging take care wear mask anywhere goes serious. least admitted wrong said karma stupid (her words).

I hope make quick safe recovery part thinks kind people pushing serious saying oh yeah bad like week good nothing fear. epidemiologists one country got wrong, reason discredit doctors scientists. Nearly EU countries appear handled better US, even Sweden. don‚Äôt really care mask using, though know definitely factor effectiveness.

What care showing anyone know become complacent wearing mask outside hanging friends/family. ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù (no one sick within days) get together hangout, outside distancing six feet without mask two, maye three feet.

But everyone different levels coping this. I‚Äôll stay inside except groceries.  seriously asking that?

Of course I'd happy wrong here, still want know. Annndd is. call idiot? would also like say differs store store heavily. Jewel close Illinois can't stand going single person tries best social distance seen people mask walk in. go Jewel 30 minutes away 90% compliance; everyone wearing mask everyone social distancing best ability. ""but masks useless virus hoax"" tried include R-word post reply auto mod removed lol See conclusory statements, i'm asking tell comment anti-science ""science relies rigorously collected data political pressure GO FASTER"" risks undermining process.

I'm pro science, means i'm anti-shitty science. many ANDAs worked on? many FDA approval processes guided pharmaceutical companies thru?

you're attacking asked i'm anti science came back ""you anti science"".

i'm willing change mind face contrary evidence. skepticism absence data part scientific process. 

You're throwing aroudn lot ad hominem attacks without single argument support. Muted. Good title. Im thrilled it, still remember narcolepsy side effect swine flu vaccine,

Many seem forget vaccine something give healthy people, vaccine COVID-19 prob become rushed vaccine human history. Close everywhere reported deaths. unreal. showing grief taking things seriously president. anything all. Yeah. New York locked 3k cases day. peaked 3 weeks later 11 k Hmm interesting agree. One main reasons want start year person actively teach use tools less overwhelming kids switch online. can‚Äôt imagine difficulty elementary teacher parent right now.  Yea still get runny nose every awhile. learn cause I'm getting enough sleep. Like 5-6h Yeah, admit stores I've (meaning... grocery store every 2-3 weeks, Target once, Living Spaces once) really good masks inside. grocery store one two people around neck something, everywhere else even people walking around making sure they're worn properly. go. I've saying months. Risk outdoor spread reduced, proximity still effect, people packing close together rivers, without masks on.

A majority protesters around country wearing masks.  ideal time third party voter, mostly lot us would like able continue vote all.

I'm sure get tired seems like hyperbole, things seem awfully bad scary right now. 

(I know vote B*rnie primaries.) Sigh...no :(. people greater NY area sacrificed months time try protect country limiting spread going watch sheer horror major urban centers go without leadership shut everything. big question one media seems asking Trump administration China beats US Europe vaccine? virus still raging US October data reviewed independent scientists countries, would Trump block China? post removed, shared sentiments US citizen no, we‚Äôve got Powder (Pence), boy wonder, (Kushner), tRump. Sometimes get hear Fauci.

It often sounds like Fauci thrown well can't climb out.........Hyelp!, Hyelp! gonna kill :( Lol. people. So. Damn. Dumb. Lots myths, old research misunderstandings gets thrown around upvoted, person asking question easy telling quality answer garbage. Oftentimes person replying eloquent language gets upvoted past person failing grasp orthography still correct. 

What find particularly egregious people strong opinion example US handling virus disguise answer came office authority subject. love community (some parts of) reddit, wary getting answers strangers might heavily invested karma score confusing strong convictions beliefs factually right. Fearing churches next. Given relatively rebellious nature many Americans, may prudent go beyond lockdowns. Restrictions upon Social Media would probably quite effective reducing flow misinformation dampening protests, albeit pretty extreme measure. Stop dramatic. None disagreement. talk hours without saying anything sitting hoping human beings get sick die get one internet stranger? I‚Äôd like see pics. telescope viewing area roof sounds awesome. DM want share them. tell people get vaccines, etc., agreeing majority medical consensus

Sure, general medical consensus well tested, well vetted, well researched vaccines. argue medical consensus YET things brand new, ongoing, cutting-edge research, especially given much yet peer tell people trust nations like U.S. U.K

Have living rock past 4 months? way mean historically trust worthy--that's different topic different time. current management, given explicit, documented, blatant lies pandemic science behind it, coupled Warp Speed pressure, skepticism called for. doctor understand that, like D.O. know drinking milk good bones.

You keep referencing flood, ignore part Noah warned everyone coming offered literal lifeboat god's behest. chose join him. reminded story everytime see idiot refuse wear mask. 

I understand full hate something believe imaginary, obviously fairly ignorant of. hate Muslims too? Buddhists? Flying Spaghetti Monster? seems pretty plain hate understand. hope conquer whatever demons troubling you. all. 80 % restaurants bars enforcing can't blame wife, prefer coast well. Grandpa liked place back '60s retired, handed till became mine spring. time keep way should, let go someone cherish it. BARS OPEN PANDEMIC?!?! Yeah, understand people wear masks outdoors. wanted provide report saw.

Although say beaches absolutely crowded, fyi anyone wondering. seemed much packed years' past, assume people spending less time restaurants, bars, shops, etc. time beach.  China? like US since early 90s. Possibly report also posits protests resulted increased isolation broadly cities. words, people likely stay indoors protests occurred. Oh fur sure.

If people don‚Äôt take sickness seriously DEF ain‚Äôt taking solution seriously. wording post makes seem like current covid spikes attributed ppl staying home. That‚Äôs ridiculous face. 

What paper saying, protests (and presumably looting) going outside, contributed vast majority others continue stay home.

In words, protests going on, ppl would‚Äôve wearing masks going bars.

FWIW: multiple protests Chicago 99% ppl wearing masks. That's real hoser would say. I‚Äôm studying go data analytics sports. Specifically baseball basketball. 

I think that‚Äôs worries though. think it‚Äôs matter get vaccine. never big events like sports again? scares dude! 100% wearer Colorado. go out, see like 20% wearing. It‚Äôs shocking many don‚Äôt wear anything. study based lies, least Colorado  unfortunately subreddit doesnt allow change headline make point would have. think precisely regional local window closing depending happens next. Seems like we're different scenarios. Big bumps drops like New York, big hills steady increases like California, straight psychopathic responses like Florida TexasÔøºÔøºÔøº Yes agree one party politicians consistently spouting misinformation generally told people listen doctors experts? mean? Big hospitalization surge deaths trending down. think we‚Äôre supposed say it‚Äôs protests now.

Just god‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt mention bars. know calling people fallacies ""bot level jargon"", thanks teaching something new.

You completely lost context conversation push political agenda. *agree* US terrible response, absolutely affect *caused* outbreak. 
 
Also never called member political elite; arrive conclusion? said members political elite use whataboutism, *not* people use whataboutism members political elite. trolling? way someone like disconnected reality. Absolutely,however deception exclusive specific political ideology. live West Coast governor, State Health Department local County Health District chose let certain businesses owned wealthy farmers families run important agriculture businesses continue operate without requirements workers, despite knowing virus spread contact certain types essential businesses, made masks mandatory everywhere well social distancing except businesses. nothing, virus spread family contact nursing homes, family community. required masks, social distancing barriers businesses June 3rd, knew businesses spreading point late March/early April. Since one county see massive infections, many deaths framed problem issue people wearing masks led huge problems region exponentially delayed people able work, etc. thing gets said real issue, know public would flip came light. I‚Äôm necessarily saying American greatest. fact countries negativity. good point USA tending overstate it‚Äôs importance. Dark twist: Human race wiped planet - Easter Eve, 2026. Donald fans, always pointing obvious. Thanks suggestion! one. specialist see mentioned passing once, like ""well, *really* want to, could sleep study"", I'm making fatigue I'm young healthy looking... Really happy one best MS centers state 10 minutes away house, keep going there. ask next time go. Well, that's still problem. can't put teachers death kid. Nope. dodged bullet one... even then, remember reason heard were, fact, tested. contact tracing system kicked made sure contain possible spread infection. still local transmission.

It let guard down, found guard good enough, plugged hole it.

Unlike Sweden, guard plug holes in... Isn‚Äôt problem risk staff families students attending well? Like student gets it, infects ten classmates two teachers carry back families community large? Opening schools real concern don‚Äôt think parents understand it‚Äôs protecting teachers (which important), entire community/their neighborhoods. 

Not mention flu season upon us top Covid. Let's hear free healthcare.  ::crickets:: They'll undoubtedly banned future entry. Canada strict entry. Mate, use vodka AK47. Bleach exist. forest fires south. Guess what? We‚Äôre going get anyway. It‚Äôs politics, it‚Äôs common sense. everyone going survive it. family coronavirus, masks wouldn‚Äôt saved them, Trump acting different wouldn‚Äôt saved them. virus left China Wuhan multiple vectors infected world. take precautions, slow eventual spread entire world. Absolutely! Trust me, felt way ages ago. stay lane, bud. Freedumb hell can't people stay home stay safe? care kill people. That's guess well... apply colleges too? Asking friend dumbest thing I‚Äôve read man, especially since minorities getting hit harder.  agree we're anything close best control spread. starts testing, we're even that.

Closed schools mean parents unable work. would lose jobs. already lots factors pushing unemployment up. Unemployment bad economy lead riots. Happens world. live GOP heavy suburb Detroit. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 5-10% people wearing masks employees. It‚Äôs honestly infuriating. guess GOP feel like best beat dems dying first. don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm still working library shifts Health Department... death rate start going soon? Lets see. remind feature here? I‚Äôll take it! billionaires bad. think maybe problem related early reopening state south according rules?

Like 2 weeks good trend stuff. Yeah, work lol.

and anyway, beaches probably safest place crown terms COVID. government intending, right now, simultaneously, open pubs nationwide locking Leicester . . . week . . .

And blaming public who've cooped weeks told, categorically, beaches open? Yuppers, tell certain BLM protests spread covid. However gatherings people whose ideas disagree definitely do. best.

But guess best good enough.

Cause are

Back before.

Seems nothin' ever changes

We're back strangers.

Wondering ought stay

Or head door. crossed El Paso month ago, person time. not. want spread virus. agree remember Rand Paul doctor. enough ""listen doctors"" bc people treat doctors like politicians side ones agree working covid vaccine covid thing? Wow! Magicians well scientists. wonder statistics mask usage US even ‚Äúwell behaved‚Äù areas like NYC.

I see tons people wearing masks nose, mention many wear masks get pass store entrance checkpoint promptly pull chin. count ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing mask!‚Äù? what? 5G towers come we‚Äôre gonna get scanned? We‚Äôre gonna get temperatured? kids going get temperatured wear masks?? insane?!? 

Those recent town hall meetings would highest form comedy weren‚Äôt real life You‚Äôre gonna notice people ordinary. minority almost always that, you‚Äôre gonna notice more. FL, AZ, TX, NV take pick. narrative decided them. think always lead headlines? guidance anywhere U.S. reduce volume music bars reduce expulsion droplets caused talking loudly? Also makes other's face hear? I've heard UK guidance. Lt. Gov say ""get die economy"" BULLSHIT! went outside today.  God science really belong sentence, though. Logically, can't.

I never ever job could push back task ""not hired for"" literally every job description magic ""and duties assigned"" makes completely open ended. Sucks, recourse liking tasks given job finding new job. 

Why rejecting applications people trying job? know details applicant, know details that. Same. live apocalypse I'm least going look cool!

I'm maker, went DIY route. Honestly really like masks, might keep using occasionally fashion, without filter breathing's easier, even over. Look, daily double! Fox argued court law entertainment news. also argued responsible viewers actions. think won. sucessfully sued. nobody knows they're talking about, means idea talking about! means everyone else know they're talking about!

As someone moved Europe, truly understand what's terrible welfare net, least Boston heard anyone moan taxes much (well, besides fact seem pay poor states hoist Trump us via voting), everyone would fine welfare state.

It's broke-ass states vote welfare improvements universal welfare.

Assuming protests spread virus around, likely would fewer people initially, seeing clusters protests another 5-12 days. think protests likely spread start new clusters, going basically popping time re-opening cases, we're basically going see massive massive spike next week likely combination both. NY protests little uptick masks, outdoors everyone moving. Let's see occupy city hall goes. made realize many people problem ‚Äúauthority figures‚Äù

As person thinks ""Trump rally (At least related legitimate election though.)"" ""BLM protest-Rioting"" dangerous, tired deeply- political opinion rooted article like this. allowed indoor seating Ontario yet. probably while. Maybe fall cools down, hopefully second wave happen. positivity rate states protests still flat, others not. Look New York, Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, Connecticut. Large protests, positivity rate flat. Regardless contact tracers asking question, expect places protests increased positivity and/or case volume. family friend's father passed. lives America, father lived home country Europe along rest family (she married American became citizen many years ago, family husband children), absolutely devastated can't see family attend sort ceremony goodbye father.

Grieving time sucks (I lost grandpa COVID couple weeks ago), least within 6 feet family see sit masks. can't imagine family friend going right now. knows she'll able see family again. Same, bro. 

Guess probably going back college yet made plan masks yet Yeah things get worse, might become common. ...ok get baked potato cheese go?

And police plan warning everyone anyway.   Greed? hear ya. didn‚Äôt visit family many months fear. also read stories younger healthy people dying scare bit! funds coming from? ‚Äúmilitarization‚Äù police terms equipment isn‚Äôt big drain funds.

The answer lies far better training, doesn‚Äôt come defunding. Without downvoted... treating flu way? Even vaccine CDC report 650,000 people die flu every year. 

Why wearing masks stop spread? people required go get doctor's note staying home? people pressured required work even flu putting everyone else jeopardy? flu downplayed much deadly?

Every time ask get downvoted oblivion I'm starting think they're trying suppress idea, way treat flu hoping coronavirus get swept carpet people go back work matter negative impact is.

I think need treat flu season treated coronavirus. Maybe make masks normalized stigma wearing one go away. Personal health needs taken seriously. Watch, they‚Äôre going spin good America reduces overseas spending puts $ American economy American, fucking good. Eh? far go better trails? I'm new LA new hiking. went restaurant VA Beach saw restaurant staff wearing masks gloves. see food runner expo person change gloves. touched screen, swept floor proceeded grab handful fries fry basket place 3 different trays gloves. nothing else, what‚Äôs going get people sick. laughed shed tear reading buck stops Trump Cuomo. Got it. I'm sorry thought bthis america Illegally buying votes pizza? Pizzagate real.  Valid worry. too. However, way I'm waiting 3 4 5 years see long term ramifications are.

In thinking delaying, there's probably significant difference (regarding knowing vaccine people long term, anything) taking late 2020 mid 2021, feel like wait mid 2021. tally today husband grocery store. 9 masks, 15 masks. count employees.. r/COVID19_support around world right? international conspiracy.

Shame you. I‚Äôll try clarify. seems sub discuss COVID, yeah, I‚Äôm posting see others thoughts experiences are.

As far family concerned, one week believe it‚Äôs over-counted states get funding feds based infection numbers. But, next week believe we‚Äôre undercounting national embarrassment high numbers. That‚Äôs 2 many different narratives make week week, opinion swinging wildly. It‚Äôs consistent.

To top off, ‚Äúthey took statistics college know can‚Äôt use data generalize infection rates across America‚Äù...based statement alone, they‚Äôve shut whole field epidemiology.

Of course data isn‚Äôt 100% accurate, never is.  But, error bars exist, trend lines accurate enough make decisions on, data useful. whole fields study help improve decision making presence uncertainty.

If we‚Äôre going debate whether it‚Äôs possible make decisions data have, experience shown conversation can‚Äôt constructively go further. Europe banned everyone March 15.

Herd immunity refers cattle.

Only 28% American population infected Spanish Flu despite around 2 years 3 waves. long time less 2/3rds ever got virus. given year, intervention, masks lockdowns, estimated 10%-30% contract seasonal flu.

Herd immunity total myth. American care. Plenty beauty states. Awesome. result government responsible takes pandemic seriously timeline based two week idea people getting sick symptoms showing. feel like people afford cabin another country would mildly inconvenienced $1200 CDN. honest think it‚Äôs pretty childish need mommy get shot.

Well shit ton people dying getting infected, tell that's bad, healthcare gets fucked up, people freak out, panic, panic, overall, we'd fucked. said, time proper strategy, herd immunity could achieved (that immunity works hope works, studies still inconclusive that), course caring people likely die virus.

Even many still stupid proud understand they‚Äôve duped. Reddit mentality:
5 guys take precautions outside, hanging one location one home: MASSIVE INFECTION RISK
Hundreds thousand people gathered barely distance one another marching across entire city stopping eat multiple locals: spreading infection toally fine. probably stock ventilators. weird question would handle moving across country? planning move CA (can't put move school.)

From airport, think makes sense directly go apartment start unpacking first go hotel, spend first night there, move apartment second night 24 hours flight?

just trying figure best way infect I'd high school students stay one class room whole day rotate teachers. Test class week keep windows doors open. Fuck heating bill. This.

Trump said quiet parts loud long appalling anyone could ever vote him. Like fact that‚Äôs death rate low extremely low young people. Yes many EU countries also worse US.

The problem politicians. problem I. American people.

We take example anthropogenic climate change. 9 10 climate scientists believe real. always 1 10 thinks society alarmist. Every single American already inherent bias use latter group confirm bias.

American people drilled kindergarten individual liberty importance else. badly dealing pandemic result societal obsession personal freedom. Americans like told do. nothing it. protesters outside masks lessens danger. agree protests could responsible spread, believe basis serious understand possible sickness would outweighed outrage. Also, president telling everyone virus hoax lot Americans putting faith failing take measures protect others Welp, seems two found new COVID partner, congrats! everything heard regional thing sure. stopped trade Mexico US would go hyper inflation supply shortages. applaud trump banned Europeans back mid-March? Theres soooo many people noses sticking :/ huge difference case count 1%-2% 20x-50x off. extremes actual case count somewhere middle that. Americans like currently living countries actually trying control virus. Stupid Trump babies ruin shit us. Thanks lot, dumb asses.  American Midwesterner I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good. Literally infected place world worst day record.

School starts Mid-August districts.  mine, 43% parents sending kids campus instead using Remote Learning option.  think Sept optimistic. get governors mandating masks everywhere allowing restaurants open dine-in?! mean, can't wear mask eating restaurant. worried public transmission, close restaurants requiring masks?

I mean understand dollars know small businesses struggling, become obvious bars, followed dine-in restaurants, top causes covid-19 spread. Sorry I‚Äôm new reading medical studies. page section details findings peer reviews study? Reminds [classic Simpsons clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCdX_KQloTk&amp;t=0m26s) can‚Äôt speak behalf website, one first ones linked searched google. 

I looking back float trips suppose white people floating people color. definitely demographics every time I‚Äôve floated younger free time. It‚Äôs due getting older make time types trips since live Houston. Way many people traveling leisurely going vacation. left state back March, needed get back lease almost I‚Äôm moving home over. I‚Äôm driving 20+ hours back next weekend. Arms yeah. Thais happens people pretend coronovirus real. People damn dumb. ppl thick lol flu!!11elf /s first hand full symptoms loss taste smell, taste metal, high like disembodied feeling, runny nose, generally yuck feelings, scratchy throat something like double pink eye. 

Unfortunately tested negative day 4. 

My symptoms progressed mostly neurological, delirium, confusion, inability think concentrate, rapid heart rate low heart rate, heart palpitations, blurry vision floating sensation. High blood pressure stage 3. day 19 dry cough still comes goes. It‚Äôs 43 days. 

These symptoms come waves feeling better reoccurring. 

Loss taste smell occurred 3 waves, levels severity. 

Doctor said probably nasty virus, couldn‚Äôt connect symptoms anything. 
 
I continue pink eye, blurry vision, hoarse voice, HR issues, currently prickly skin cold sensations. 
 
But maybe random virus picked wearing mask social distancing...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm sorry loss. don‚Äôt friends, let alone friends India. Lambs slaughter that. lol don‚Äôt know even testing point. Like even point point gonna anything? Yep. many ambulances paramedics coming city nearby states help out, nearly enough ambulances own. 

The stress hearing endless sirens first 2 months straight, tapering towards third month. literally one sounds heard outside.. since city entirely shut one venturing essential workers, odd person getting groceries. sounds sirens, real. 

It‚Äôs heart breaking watching what‚Äôs happening now. want repeat months ever again. friends family state never really understood going city, hadn‚Äôt affected extreme here, brushed ‚Äúthe price living big city‚Äù. scared even then. didn‚Äôt heed warnings then, surely won‚Äôt now, possibly, maybe it‚Äôs late. 

The sirens tho, knowing people inside ambulances, death best prolonged suffering, almost surely meant them.. it‚Äôs hard pill swallow. me, likened sound death despair. before, sound hope, treatment would ultimately receive hospital would succeed- would get help needed timely fashion, live see another day. months, much. 

And it‚Äôs ringing someone else‚Äôs head hear, which, wish upon anyone. wish whole saw happened NYC, prevented happening anywhere else, obviously case, breaks heart. reason they're suddenly necessary people finally time protest things important. work 6 days per week daylight hours hard protest injustice. port storm. pass half million dead 10 million total cases people barely bat eyelid. Craziness. Aka minorities Believe cali, story circulated national tv people refuse wear masks, purposely power shop *hoping someone says something scream yell*
These people going way extra unsafe,to justify anger Facebook faux news filled with. lord denial dude.

No I'm not, clearly are. NBA cancel season test results, tells something. Something drastic happen NBA season fully canceled think SIGNED PAPER, means nothing stop it? lol wat. season even STARTING let alone finishing.

What? No. point. NBA coaches vocally said really want participate, fine. Besides, lot teams Orlando 3 full months so, since NBA teams eliminated early NBA season/playoffs. tells older coaches trust NBA's safety protocols Orlando bubble spoke it. NBA season definitely start. NBA season finished different question, NBA season definitely start. NBA NBPA (National Basketball Players Association) finalizing deal restart 2019-2020 NBA season COVID-19 test results released says lot lol totally misspelled Kudlow. Sounds like boss, im fine dining waiter Montreal, wait problem solved. Restaurant dining rooms clearly disease vector. Skeleton crew operative phrase :) cannot infect already dead! Covid-19 novel coronavirus. probably unknowns there‚Äôs knowns. young absolutely don‚Äôt want become sick coronavirus. don‚Äôt know implications disease. face uncertainty, keep eyes open mouth shut. keep cards close chest. cut losses. take lime make lime juice sell falsely advertising lemonade. survive. youngest age bracket millennial :) Tempting. worth 14 days quarantine return journey. Lol nba wants finish season Florida? Even paying 10 percent 22000 dollars much end patient pay medication honestly. 20 percent discount means youre going crippling debt slightly less crippling debt quick assume I'm American. Tbf: thought well. US ban European tourists awhile back March? mean can't really complain banned first we're letting virus run rampant. wonder folks are. Grocery store - people except employees wearing masks. one including employees restaurant wearing masks except older man. Walked away without even walking couple feet in. survey district. I‚Äôm Missouri, state rising numbers bad Florida/Arizona/Texas.. yet. It‚Äôs district substantial disadvantaged population means. 76% parents wanted kids back school, 20% undecided 3% would send kids back. school district far said opening reduced capacity, doubt masks required either. guess I‚Äôm 3% unless something changes. Everywhere multiple days protest. That‚Äôs study about. Even places multiple days protest see protest-related covid infections. poorly worded Whereas Australians New Zealanders Western cultures? Texas recovery refusing wear mask üôÑ. 

Masks political statement. That‚Äôs insane. Masks improving community health faster get back normalcy sooner. essentially moron too, fiance EU understand we're banned, heart hurting. Good god get Hilary.

Are going talking rest life? Trump: http://imgur.com/gallery/HZ4YKrs part country local area 49% positive cases Hispanic population part don‚Äôt social distance wear masks. drive park multiple groups least 30 people hanging out. stupidity knows bounds honestly unless people power royally fuck up, going end bloody uphill battle actual lasting change happens. Yeah, get it‚Äôs definitely harder social distance due density, said China, Japan, etc. 

I‚Äôm honestly familiar Indian government social net place society like. remember seeing stuff years ago said investing creating better net citizens don‚Äôt know looks like. Hopefully whatever pays now. far know, they‚Äôve kind lockdown awhile depending location. 

I‚Äôm hoping things don‚Äôt get bad least buy months learn virus deal it. sure one confusing weird anecdotal percentage facts.
Please try engage debate uses flimsy nonsense basis. Yeah 2 days ago. next day implemented wardens far spread out, enjoy posting old things ?? Okay acknowledged incorrect former assumption, makes immediately want change subjects start talking something else. difficult take step back reexamine biases immediately going another offensive. 

Thanks opinion biggest threat Black American lives centuries today systemic racism. good one. Sounds like bars become 501c3 least rent building ""church loud rave music"" Well you‚Äôre actually take information healthy understanding media literate couple points 

-case numbers irrelevant. Hospital numbers deaths matter. states experiencing high hospitalizations deaths general trending downwards due restrictions better treatments. disease deadly statistically begin with. Everybody seems forgotten simple steroid used reduce deaths much third. That‚Äôs huge. 

-secondly, modified MERS vaccine beginning stage three trials relatively soon. Could available mass production around December. That‚Äôs right around flu season BEGINS. Ironic never aim administration Oh yeah I'm feeling better already. horrible runny/itchy nose. symptoms subsided 90%. 

Totally corona lol. Thank god. Thats almost full dollar Northern Ohio live graduated. 100% chance bar going comply social distancing guidelines. make way much money college kids don‚Äôt care. line street weekends 3 hour wait. Inside bars masks packed shoulder shoulder.  Aww darn, gonna spend stimulus check trip Pari√© see Effil Tower eat snailz. Oh well. Say la vi But... even noon there? mean they‚Äôre lying. least neighborhood Brooklyn, 20-30% wear masks point. Mind you, outside seems make much difference. haven‚Äôt inside another building since March 11th idea stores, assume it‚Äôs gotta much higher percentage. photos taken apartment window yesterday past weekend. constantly hundreds people congregating outside maybe one two wearing masks. I'm hipster. care gross fatty-fruit not. Point also reduce infection rate, less risk reopening. guess use EU PASSPORT. Obama seemed like great step forward America, took *at least* 2 steps back afterwards did. America falling apart structurally way failed states have. It‚Äôs starting higher point. Fuck willful blindness. Honestly I‚Äôm okay 1, 2 MAYBE 3 years. I‚Äôm worried lasting forever.

One thing gives hope among things human species extremely smart. world adjust, life get better, etc. want life something worth living right feel like I‚Äôm wasting time studying school. 

I feel like things become senseless. feel like I‚Äôll never get love (sports) back. know people boat makes feel worse! do? wonder Americans would get entire world banned us entering country really earn trust we're allowed back in. There's LOT need get house order. would want go Europe? God bless America else. Lmao nothing subreddit scares me. time I‚Äôll take covid19 post seriously it‚Äôs posted /r/Covid19 **Our European visitors important us.**

**So please fuck yourself.**

\- American media. Im OT working hospital comment scared Turned 550 month + 7500$ insurance would cover 80% causes side affects year later, trials arent even going last another 6 months, Oxford may done end year, even sooner, that's enough time see long term affects. Higher viral load could case many healthcare workers provided service without PPE. Americans disregard expert opinions anyways

Worse yet Americans cherry pick ""experts"" (that actually experts) ""believe"". mix blind faith, willful ignorance, tribalism fucking scary. gloating face coronavirus, think position discuss anything me. Yep. Never really met yet, year. gonna meat multiple times backfired. finally good plan meet Florida April. Covid happened sucks went shopping pensioner who's nearly 90 wore one shocked saw 2 3 people one, fucker following arrows get round people waved real attempt distancing. I'm sure gonna lead can't good. Shut fuck sides bullshit. Correct nobody evidence work strains.

Wait vaccine. may see mutations specifically addressing vaccine. Yeah, hot right now, right... maybe go Ireland. think riding hard long man... Masks also protect wearer. Even basic surgical masks helping healthcare workers areas higher viral count typical Walmart would have. Exactly, factor $1200 trip costs. Go wherever want, hold piece paper saying already fined, they're likely fine twice.

Like story girl dated rich guy whatever. like ""you can't park allowed"" he's like ""it's allowed, costs $200"". Fines cost want. Incoming tweet Europeans allowed United States stop spread horrible plague European Hotspots thought Abbot didnt believe virus isnt going hurt anyone? simp lol reminds woman cut hole mask complained mask hot. Ah shoot sorry, makes sense! 

I'm Phoenix, Arizona (USA) People taking covid seriously Mexico government (who controls travel). *They* fucked. that's sad, can't help want help. Yeah.... country highest GDP (by far) one higher standards living 3rd world country. Things country different worse since Obama/Bush/Clinton charge. 

The guys asshole, let's act like tough here. offends people, says mean things, genuinely good person. issues (as every country) we're still regarded powerful country one of, wealthiest one (GDP per capita). Trump mean ignore statistics. guarantee people hate Trump never country actually 3rd world problems. Midwest anything coasts. Starts Ohio ends California. sounds like got celiac disease/fibro/CFS, weird blend depending Dr saw gave going interesting essentially handed Biden election. highly doubt moderates vote Trump debacle, recent polling seems confirm Biden massive lead. mention people coming woodwork vote Trump, virus would guarantee biggest democrat turnout time. course COVID19 complicates bit, still think people clamoring vote election given chance get Trump office.

After 2016 take grain salt, anything still happen. I'm surprised would go route painting public heath emergency left wing hoax always high likelihood backfiring (what's happening right southern red states). 

The people run network stupid manner people commonly think are, know they're order make tons money keep base line. can't understand angle thought this, expected outcome was. find hard believe actually truly believed virus hoax, seemed like angle drum controversy.

There's doubt portion viewers upset loved one gets sick dies COVID19, realize led astray network early months pandemic. agree! one's ignoring there's pandemic going deserves everything get. Putting others risk want go beach day trip somewhere ridiculous, ‚Äômuh freedom‚Äô crap causing people die. disappointing see :( burn it? thing is, went poorly, could blame Fauci supporters would eat up. pandemic response intentionally malicious. North Carolina agrees, shares bbq sidesteps 6 feet away well. Mm. refer germs microbes - general terms *necessarily* include viruses. lots products antimicrobial claims lately, unless specifically mentions viruses, never bother see there's 3rd party testing. look though. Maybe legit. could still go (dual citizenship), would quarantine two weeks arrive employer requires two weeks quarantine return US. It‚Äôs feasible something like that. American, give Nelson ‚ÄúHA-HA!‚Äù Education professors uncanny ability know nothing education. Sorry close. Afghanistan first country starting A.  LA - entire country aligning things Idaho. swear, even half people wear masks.

Today went back phase 3 (bars closed again) spike new cases got critical. People knew it, last weekend got hear lot idiots partying like it‚Äôs spring break, maskless drunk. 

Can‚Äôt wait see new case statistics two weeks! actual carnie barker would huge step up. Huge. Covid FAR list threats black people's lives. sure getting info. progress always uphill  make better comments glory party! Comrade, try harder. Europeans residents Europe go Europe (tho difficult find flights) Remember, Azar lawyer political appointee contributed disaster slow initial response. health professional. Sadly, people message needs delivered mock Europe say absolutely never wanted go Europe first place, allow fuel martyr complex still educate, done online.

Anything else sentencing teachers death.

I'd rather smart kids adapt teachers safe coddle ones likely going issue anyway. mean covid least worries... full blown war cartels. It‚Äôs dangerous fucking Afghanistan there. place mess. thing exponential spread it‚Äôs stopped, could actually achieve herd immunity pretty quickly point.

It‚Äôs worth letting get point means 50% people need hospital bed would turned away. saw Trump coining Keep America great. could make sman easy campaign ad, current pictures trucks full corona dead, protesters manhandled cops Trump playing golf. Europeans perpetrated way genocides? I.e. Hitler, Stalin, Conquistadors? got six fig job. dumb rock barely graduated shit tier state school. Ffs. one immigrate Germany?

My last insurance plan got public sector job 550$ month kid I. 20% copay, plus X amount deductible. Annual pocket like 7500$ things insurance would cover anything. 7500 wasn‚Äôt including monthly premium. phase 4 phase 3 success ready production? Thanks inputs, much knowledge this. makes Trump look bad. That's it. That's is. want orange football team lose. reasons: First, treatment getting better. Second, early people without fever advised get tested many people mild symptoms didn‚Äôt think went normal routines. Third, safeguards become norm reducing amount virus people exposed to. Fourth, people risk fatal outcomes protected protecting themselves. Fifth, prolonged indoor exposure risk reduced significantly working home, cancelling large events, etc. seen number Americans respecting restrictions? No, would make sense. would like ‚ÄùI going Alaska‚Äù Canada. Also Texas. relatives come CA, stay week, multiple family get togethers. nobody sick it‚Äôs pure luck point, would likely still fully isolating choice. Extra nervous I‚Äôm pregnant. Minneapolis seen steady decrease number new cases protestors tested 1% positive, far national average. Putin‚Äôs aim along Well let‚Äôs take Second World War example. Without United States, Japan would‚Äôve taken pacific, best allies would hope stalemate Please lie non indians Let's meet halfway ca Chump virus? Europe build Wall Atlanta order keep covid-bastard americans away! Make Europe great again!!!! Nah rich gonna let masses test hide gated communities ""work"" home country quarantine citizens, country needs quarantined. signs point way around. Like banned forever ? God damn I‚Äôm mad didn‚Äôt get fuck shit storm thought everyone already agreed can't eradicate virus like this

China rest East Asia disagreed. strategy used western countries ""flatten curve"". healthcare system centric approach assumed long healthcare system overwelmed, good job. Meanwhile China East Asia much stricter goal eradicating virus cutting mechanism spread. hate Online classes.... can‚Äôt teach ugly show true colors say right want silenced? show us process one favor tyrannical rule dictator silences dissidents. allowed Canada either. 

Not big loss compared Europe. Canada even tough letting people move states broken law. already pretty strict. much less half. I'll become angry if/when US gov starts applying pressure Canada agree open border again. seem keen act though everything control, desire participate charade. may become tough Canadian leadership US decides make painful (e.g. tariffs), hold ground. I'd hope so! I'm sure injecting anything veins kushner mixed together Trump's medicine cabinet. probably adderall bleach.  r/woosh Crime time low major cities. american feel offended handling virus terribly cant blame Misleading article. countries European *Union*. loss tourism revenue countries' gain. Dude take chill pill, don‚Äôt wanna France country, want go UK regardless amenities European countries give them. Thus got granted illegal status don‚Äôt wanna register. Either educate stay snowflake, Good absolutely ridiculous article. else California, specifically LA county, still complete lockdown *a lot* protests, seeing large uptick cases? agree you-and problem states pulling Sweden much interstate travel US, everyone pay mistakes states‚Äô (lack of) leadership. would variation contact tracing even associate American point.

I born choice, stayed choice either. Lmaooo guy , got trump slave Fair treatment cities took seriously came minimal cases. Yes. 

It fair treatment. 100%. Majority works together, problems fixed. 

If don‚Äôt think majority take accountability responsibility, leave move. fair, majority south Florida locals take seriously.

it's 100s thousands karens vacation fuck daily lives up. help state level leadership also EDS developed chronic fatigue syndrome contracting H1N1 flu. want get COVID well. don‚Äôt think people understand delicate balance autonomic system is. (I surely didn‚Äôt previously.) isnt logical. emotional.

This might deathblow Europe's already stagnant economy. office job pandemic. got laid beginning pandemic. unemployed scared.

I turned offers wanted come office pick work laptop. told leaving house anything. Eventually, found employer said fedex work laptop want you.

I recommend stick firm standards. compromise health health family.

Some thoughts.

1. kids school system offering online education. believe need teachers. probably market online teachers. probably marketed casual employment - meaning expectation hire following school year.
2. wife gotten tutoring work high school kids. Basically happy school's online instruction getting outside tutoring probably would otherwise sought out.
3. enrolled kid online reading supplemental program. thing long COVID-19 imagine demand going roof. Consequently need teachers. go r/FloridaMan r/FloridaWoman Ah, alt.

You seem defending pedophilia also. 

Blocked, pedo can, however, check temperature, think enforcing quarantine ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù, least keep track him/her contact tracing. Unfortunately, stay away ones right next coast. Temescal Canyon, lot ones right PCH (Solstice, etc.) beautiful, crowded. go, recommend early morning and/or week. (We got 9-ish yesterday still way busy.) Coast-wise, recommend heading inland going ones middle Santa Monica Mountains. lot Backbone Trail still beautiful mountain/ocean views, lot fewer people.

If looking something mountain-y, try avoid Hollywood Hills. Again, lot people looking IG pictures actual recreation. Griffith Park good, big enough place less-crowded trails.

The trails north Pasadena, Montclair, etc. pretty nice, tend ""we're going mountain looking city.""

I keep going! LA abundance really wonderful hikes. hate people. Europe country. Believe not, different rules laws.  see anyone could ever safely ride public transport again.  ""didnt believe"" oxygen started breathing. also deadly polio longshot. They're empirically credible allegations Brett Kavanaugh upset about. Nobody Europe blames anyone travel bans point. It‚Äôs personal never was, necessary. don‚Äôt want keep people away also don‚Äôt want people die. pissed much reply twice?

I proving counterpoint US many people know always see Americans smart, can-do attitude, confident.

No, everyone sees US like that. Europeans know pretty bad opinion Americans. recently, last 20 years. donated weeks ago, would able tell? American broke even go Europe rn almost literally nothing useful those. Abd course managed pointlessly rude European closure communicating reason except piss people (which smart course, base loves posses anyone) sound mad hell guy mean sure take dip USA third largest country tourism wise. guarantee large percentage still go on. I'm pro-mask pro-vax, Trump triumphantly unveils American vaccine election, international vaccine efforts ready...I lot questions.

Trump's lied many things since started, take word vaccine safe effective. 

An ""October surprise"" vaccine would vetted country, least major NGO like Gates Foundation.

IMO, Trump U.S. government agencies headed Trump appointees credible topic.  What‚Äôs wrong post? ones haven‚Äôt done anything need get ass therapy shit, graveyard like others like couldn‚Äôt control themselves. say ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù awful lot. never refer friend usually means something like ‚Äúlisten little shit‚Äù. agree language, but

""China may responsible degree every death?""

The U.S. may responsible degree every AIDS death Trump tiny hands, long arms. seem know lot science little corruption.  Lmaooo kid , got nothing else say insults . Saltyyyy kidddd Every single restaurant tell following guidelines. owners want you. They're telling truth.

 damn cash card ready payment! tmc.edu updated notice saying missing data published later today. 

Whether intentional omission part not, good job everyone making fuss. hoping gets refund planned trip Paris September wasn‚Äôt going get plane anyhow. bastard Goddammit, never going get see Germany. last five years I've saving effort take wife Germany Christmastime visit markets, general touristy stuff, renew vows. We've never chance travel before, wanted surprise. got good paying new job three years ago, finally January enough money savings seriously consider putting plan action--I researching hotels flights, convinced wife DuoLingo German (under guise helping us better understand show Dark) fucking goddamn piece shit virus hit government's ineptitude responding fucked foreseeable future. Motherfucker. Oh well, DuoLingo still fun. Prost allerseits. UK far deaths per capita US? Lmao Ah, suggesting Putin happy can‚Äôt travel Europe makes prisoner mind. I‚Äôm live one everybody, stay back? Ya still hard get vaccines right (cf. dengue) afaik there's never vaccine coronavirus Asian countries know (source: living there, waiting get back), exception Cambodia stringent conditions. anyone knows different, please respond, I'd sure like know. mean he's already got bunker living in, good wall? want mass infection, 10 weeks enforced confinement everyone home?

It even work, still outbreaks china now. cost one granny worlds respect! COVID-19 latent intracellular pathogen elicits NF-kB driven cellular immune response. response cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced inside cells order kill pathogens. response also aberrantly activated absence infection. becomes chronic, cell damage death occur, leading disease.

ROS produced metalloenzymes. However, NF-kB activation 'two way street', inasmuch excessive production ROS normal functioning enzymes, upregulate NF-kB, potential become vicious circle.

The main sites within cells ROS production takes place mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membrane. Many environmental chemicals, including air pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrcarbons, benzene metal oxides, processed inside cells iron dependent cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes receptors nuclear membrane. results production ROS, upregulating NF-kB.

CYP polymorphisms particularly implicated this, logical assume produce ROS, although evidence lacking. Living areas high air pollution means NF-kB already upregulated population, additional upregulation COVID-19 likely become dangerous. sounds like got got. got mine Amazon 3 left stock beginning people realized serious was. full face masks interchangeable 3m fititngs $100 $30 got quick. 

I also got last n95 shop mask Harbor Freight.

back shopping also went Home Depot. shocked shelf n95 shop masks stocked employee said chinese people buying shelves fast could put send relatives China. shocked twice. realized handling items likely handled likely carriers new disease time since many might come back chinese new year usa also realized bad going get.

a week later everyone everything. guy says got sick within hours bar means already sick went infected people. Phase 1-3 trials for. also, many vaccines time tested delivery methods. sister/brother law waiting (Canada), annual Spain trip happen. Thanks goodness privilege invoked yet again. üôÑüôÑüôÑ Hey least Tom Arnold excellent True Lies I'd say heavily depends are. love large city go grocery store, nearly 100% people wearing masks. happened small town couple hours away, mask usage 50% best. Sure, think worth remembering lots essential workers working public whole time without extra pay. many get 2 months year pension either. Cant wait hear trumpets say would lie something easily fact checked?  American currently living Canada, keep Americans out! let crazies get Canada too! Ya thoughts exactly Reasonably unbiased analysis drugs effects media, coronavirus patients, others need drug. Yep, sides.

The left ignored COVID protests right protests wel stupidly around NOOO SHIT. FUCKIN SHITTING NUTS.

NO FUCKIN WAY. virus spreading air conditioning systems. one safe restaurant bar. Unless install better purification systems schools office buildings safe either. always choices dipshit. time fucking throw asshat another win fucking woke. Deaths starting climb (again) nationally

There fewer deaths past week prior. Nice fun. booked honeymoon November 2k inclusive 12 days. prices imploded virus broke out. thing flights. Yeah nothing w fact female skeletor opponent Introduced low-paid workers get sick leave compensation, go work sick. Lmao Thats true. city Jalisco April see single person without mask on. given single chance tested renounce citizenship. want live anymore. feel like deja vu doesn‚Äôt Hey. group us Karen's. mask wearing Kevin attempting decent human shitstorm 2020 take offense that. says lot went entire tirade made uninformed inferences political stances based single question asked you. yes way get out, would. 
 
liar ask get statistics? wasn‚Äôt asked. I‚Äôm sure anyone know anyone reading wasn‚Äôt asked either ‚Äúpewresearch‚Äù. Stop lies. ""Oh noes!""

- European families normal circumstances, EU countries would reluctantly admit Americans historic economic reasons.

But, there's also internal EU politics going here. EU coordinate approach third-country visitors order restore free travel trade internally, keep EU borders 27 members open.

You can't Americans travel ""open"" Spain, border restrictions travel ""closed"" France. people fighting wearing masks either don‚Äôt money desire leave precious America anyways.. Bad news: Americans lying. one tell straight face 80% people encounter wearing masks. F summer vacations

No surprise though funny first time read this, definitely funny 12th time. well thing is, foreigners come US, higher chance getting infected. Like would anyone want that? number weekend, good luck Florida, sure miss you... surprised fuck üò≠ Woah!!! Dont know there's VIRUS going around??? Ugh,,, HELLO?????? Coronavirus????? Ring bell?????!?!?!?!?!? like rapist vs rapist. underplay however like candidates pieces shit. Well least one laughing America anymore!

/s wear mask moving people‚Äôs stuff U Haul trucks, excuse people wear regular basis. I‚Äôll admit me. I‚Äôm completely disturbed see exact thing happening here. think public health data could sway preventative measures/decision making sacrosanct. Fudging numbers ensures suffering death. should‚Äôve known would happen here. I‚Äôve seen it. Change needs happen. Implementing mask mandate statewide would pretty simple thing would stopped lot spread virus. governor still refuses this. really pathetic Americans engaged divisive rhetoric. Meanwhile, weeks crisis started EU, EU countries quickly got squabbles showed solidarity. Whether like not, New Yorkers, traveling Canada, Europe, anywhere else long epidemics still rage South California. Deaths typically peak Monday Tuesday it‚Äôs better compare seven day average. Also there‚Äôs lot testing done recent cases younger. Isnt expected illnesses? never bounced right back 100% simple stomach bug.. Yes changed ignorance bailout Sunday. ZAP. TASER TASER!! Masks even debate secondary schools. points people make masks little children. learning go already concluded get leave permanently damaged. done fits doomsday fantasy.

This nearly bad want be. world wont end. Hundreds millions wont die. much Europe depends American tourist dollars? would guess hits tourist nations really hard American I‚Äôm bummed partner need get hell dumpster fire. bad news you. would disagree. Percent positive still go community transmission still rising curve undiagnosed Mexico starting wish they'd paid wall. US media, usual, already decided narrative. question whether anyone get useful education mess. actually learn anything via distance learning? learn anything going school days week?

*If* going learn much circumstances see lot risk little reward.

I mindset kid, learning disability, probably get little effective education next year, repeat grade 2021-22. China currently drying fresh water supplies multiple countries crops? ""Not legally binding list..."" mean?? official? 

Also whose say able fly England travel countries there? I‚Äôm saying pay attention trends. 

[deaths trending downwards conjunction hospitalizations love science much troubled process makes science rigorous objective might undercut panic desperation politics fear. I‚Äôm pro puppies. doesn‚Äôt mean pro puppy mill.

So many logical fallacies someone claims ""pro science"". I'm talking 3 Gorges dam potentially giving out, cause collapse China, 400 million people affected, economic damage would devastating China worldwide. point become legal matter Honest question, worldometer showing 10,000 new cases today? People starting realize argue trash like waste time.

Pointing laughing works much better shut trashcans up. Good time dual citizenship Fucking title gore - Americans aren‚Äôt banned Europe, **travellers US won‚Äôt allowed in,** that‚Äôs big difference. People find workaround, like always do. That's like wearing condom balls. Even worse today Sunday testing cycle normally results reduced cases Sunday. suspect numbers catastrophic Tuesday. can‚Äôt social distance, respirator mandated, cloth procedure mask.  $1 /litre gallon many first 60 people catch virus US actually died? Probably none. many lives would saved prevented catching spreading it? Tens thousands minimum. Link work. threaten good time, officer. No, like remind done there. Okay üëå! Liberals Hell yeah official? see sources thing read earlier week, ""unlikely"". Expect eat proper croissant time soon someone's butthurt they're little job ain't cutting see. lol.

If someone told April May would happen, would confidently said no, saw went still dealing NYC trump personally developed vaccine, they'd everything convince ppl take Goodness knows fucking threads conspiracy connect ramshackle mind. way poor Americans solve problems, vote something fat, old retarded that's menu take ass European. I‚Äôm sorry live besides incompotence stupidity personified wait corporate profits take even bigger beating, maybe, maybe, govt start caring virus.

Its like civil rights act 64'. govt ""give"" people rights right thing do. No, corporations big business knew losing money making enough. reason suddenly soulless corporations pro BLM/LGBTQ that. Problem people wearing masks also people answering polls...

NYC:

Population: 8,400,000

Infection rates higher 25% that‚Äôs pretty old serological data. Let‚Äôs go 30% (2,520,000 lowest possible estimate) meaning IFR 0.87... **not even 1% anywhere close 2% that‚Äôs sure. **

NY Whole:

Deaths: 31,105 5.82

Population: 19,400,000

Assuming 30% (5,820,00 infections) get IFR 0.5% even anywhere close 2%. letter called Gov. Greg Abbott‚Äôs order ‚Äúirresponsible shameful‚Äù.

Ohhhhh irony. contradicted yourself.

But thanks incorrect judgement making feel even worse situation. everyone wearing mask mentioned? real. Pretty irresponsible Europe. American living Europe, fuck. Canada That's locked hard, wore masks. complicated. time pay inactions. Though I'm sure right try blame left this. country handled virus like shit. Sure looks like it.

[Texas Medical Center leadership looks assuage ICU capacity fears amid COVID-19 new cases eclipsing capabilities, staff supplies meet demand community,‚Äù said Dr. David Callender, president CEO Memorial Hermann Health pinch, bring place ICU beds limited-time basis,‚Äù Boom press conference came shortly Gov.

This wish apps connected larger database used public places employees tracking amount people visit shop business. Instead in/out, add option ‚Äúin(mask worn properly/in(improper mask)/in(no mask)/out/good fucking riddance‚Äù 3-4 months we‚Äôve gone averaging well 2000 deaths day 600. It‚Äôs unlikely get anywhere near 2000 per day mark projections I‚Äôve seen say 180k-200k October 1. wide margin error. 

Sorry detracting important series cutesy little jokes. also (entirely) accurate. There's thing called Congress. go Washington DC create laws people represent. I'm thinking it...I think Pelosi one people. live NYC myself! I'm praying stay social distancing wearing face mask PROPERLY long time keep everyone safe. started phase 2 past Monday medical suggestion antibodies disappear within two three months. HOWEVER, people misunderstanding means. Antibodies always disappear within time frame MEAN immune. medical experts believe even antibodies dissipated, body recognizes virus able reproduce antibodies quickly chances one getting sick degree low. wonder long last, assume vaccine? 

Only that's takes US get cases control. Americans started wearing masks states continue shutting risky activities like bars states cases exploding could happen then. EU going re-evaluate every 2 weeks. local Reddit don‚Äôt know non-Asian country able contain virus without lockdowns. It‚Äôs highly contagious. It‚Äôs contained Sweden curve hasn‚Äôt flattened. people actually dumb Make two.

Drunk driving accidents

Family violence - Shootings, Physical fights

Fireworks accidents See Italy, France, Spain UK examples sn overloaded Healthcare system affects death rates. Holy shit. AMSTERDAM EMPTY FIRST TIME YEARS!!!!! Show many doctors missing? full denial makes sense 100k deaths US. Keep going Yeah you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve using worldometer said 10k seeing 8k. I‚Äôm scientist. you? Krueger

I really hate arrogance seems come days. yeah, Maine folks small islands (understandably, feel) quite resistant tourists getting boat all. leading lot community stress though, even local folks island summer houses considered ""from away"" welcome. dilemma. good point, although it‚Äôs one area Germany meatpacking plant outbreak. Overall German cases still way compared pre-lockdown. Apart business trips, ones would travel ones take safety precautions. think everyone quarantine wear masks another year two even thinking traveling. Trump. Around White House. good thing 7% gotten corona pandemic start die out. Sir, 72, I'm cancer survivor, hypertension, COPD. top President Trump's moral philosophy would like die freaking economy re-elected, kill people like myself. 

So able understand say literally much time left, I'm going waste commenting unscientific ideas. problem! guy basically saying, needs put finger socket feel shock, else believe electrity exists. people attitudes like this, going take longer get Covid-19 control.

Yes, entirely predictable people would exist (and large numbers), _primarily_ failure government/leadership measures mask wearing mandated law. Isn‚Äôt closer 7x 9/11 death toll mistaken words Trump perfectly describes everyone else currently views you:

SAD. hysteria surge will. sure. I'm willing bet lot us *incredibly* offended hear this. 

We ourselves, guys. thought according Reddit Americans wanted escape Mexico now. Ha. Ha. key phrase ""made appropriate authorities."" ruling cited *upheld* lockdown order, argued states proper authorities matter.

The author article admits Supreme Court might strike federal pandemic response laws unconstitutional, despite insisting be. fails understand almost definition, constitution Supreme court says is. Supreme Court already indicated stand issue. ""It's good black moon"" First testing.
Then data dump.
Then brown people.
Then kids.
Then tests again.

Seems like need fresh spin. Well kinda paid highway connects Alaska United States, better cut land access, especially considering would break treaty signed. last desk pop? Insurance companies pay paying $80,000 per patient health care costs Hep C patients. it‚Äôs $60,000 cost savings per patient. 

A recent analysis reported Medicaid alone saved 7.7 BILLION dollars due coast offsets curative Hep C drugs. mention private insurance Medicare. I‚Äôm New Mexico, we‚Äôve 11k total cases. 1M people located Albuquerque/Santa Fe metropolitan area, areas recorded 2,400 cases. 

It‚Äôs hard wear damn mask. need start checking covid vs protests/riots since month since first ones.

can make list cities first riots started first mass gatherings marches? cities similar time frames all.

then start looking covid case alignment any.

I know mobile protesters going city city know least well. lol like they're going listen doctor I'm loose end ""essential worker"". I'll trying push way top list healthcare workers senior citizens taken care (politicians wait line). ask Portuguese authorities. cares, left shithole  4 months old news ? fee that. live large apartment complex (300-400 units) gave woman piece mind last week jogging around building mask passing people/exits within 2 feet breathing heavily. looked look I‚Äôm ‚Äúone them‚Äù. SoCal. government WELDED BARS ONTO DOORS homes apartments force people stay inside.

Yes.. That's less cases got control quickly... irony post picture guy without mask make America great hat. Russia likes help things along like malicious gossip. I‚Äôm even European I‚Äôm happy clarify, difference degree, type. US never got numbers far first peak - sense, they‚Äôve constantly (in different parts US) last 3-4 months.

Our curve looks like this: __/\ less, though end still bit higher beginning. US‚Äôs _/^^^ it‚Äôs starting tick again. rights important. Martial law coming! Open eyes, stay informed! /s"
