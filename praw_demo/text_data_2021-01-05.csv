 Mar 24, 2020 Bill Gates says *we can't* restart *economy* soon simply “ignore *pile bodies* corner”. 

Cant find Cuban Quote, basically thing. americans poverty leads obesity fast food cheapest option

Canada doesnt huge corn syrup lobbies either. Something like 1 5 adults Texas probation parole.

Sorry pencil out. Running quick math:

* 2020 Census numbers peg [the population Texas [Census QuickFacts indicates 25.5% state's pop minors. Therefore 74.5% adults, 21,873,765

* [this Prison Legal News seems legit, fairly timely (last February) indicates 482,000 Texans parole probation. 

That works 2.2% Texas adults -- nowhere close ""1 5"" 20 percent. Sorry, squire thank you! stay safe Classic Texas. *Posse Comitatus Act,* Congress authorize exceptions President decent amount discretion too.

The original idea end Army involvement state governments, suppressing KKK enforcing end slavery. That's Dixiecrats wanted Army's power domestic politics curbed, could get around enforcing white supremacy local police departments.

But northerners (who, remember, much late age steam) interested election 1876. *fiercely* contested incredibly close. Democrats used paramilitary wings, Republicans ran incredibly boring candidate attack campaign calling Democrats rebels. 

So boring centrist party liberal name-calling openly racist right-wing party fight standstill. compromise boring Republican (Hayes) would president, would stand Army let Democrats whatever pleased South. 

(Which basically low-grade terrorism reestablishing aparthood.)

But summer economic left wing - labor unions - took initiative throw huge protests probably closest America ever general strike.

(Imagine antifa's black bloc backbone dudes shovel coal lay steel living.)

*Nobody* money power wanted that. imagining something Paris Commune. Hayes called Army one last big hurrah.

By way, West Virginia's militiamen refused shoot strikers. Good refusing unlawful order.

Congress worried Hayes might finally found testicular fortitude, parties passed Posse Comitatus Act rein in.

So yeah. Congress actually telling President ""no,"" burly syndicalist Catholic railworkers, liberal Republicans white-pride Democrats. America changed lot since military kicked domestic peacekeeping.

It probably best, crazy historical context. Well actually no, government specifically said construction could continue, huge number construction companies made decision shut government happy about. Shared air without mask makes people si k, yes.

And: bad hand hygiene + mouth contact! vaccine give 100% immunity expecting disappointed. emergency meeting eject china space, remove world?  Maybe people love doom...or maybe really tough year lot us we're expecting worst. 

I'm tired seeing comments imply anyone enjoying shit. People scared. rightly so. not? We’ve 0 cases live since May. masks ever needed social distancing relaxed June. back normal 6 months Got Jackma'ed remember obsessed doomsday apocalypse shows remember one said disease likely kill human race. 

I thought ‘pfft disease yeah right. It’s gonna super volcano aliens’ 

......God spite Really? heard that. Can't looting/rioting. Wonder contributing factors. monoclonal antibody treatments hardly used Wow read seeing message.

Incredible. hope jurors bystanders sue damages

&amp;#x200B;

Its reckless court Ok. concede first point. misinterpretation part. also believe 87k cases almost certainly low, think necessarily due intentional misreporting, rather lack testing. think situation back probably worse said be. whispers things far worse, although think anything conclusive come out. That's however something pretty easy China hide. However, think situation right worse they're letting on. removed significant amount restrictions. Heck even foreigners confirm large crowds gathering New Years parties. pandemic control, simply cannot hide immense number cases deaths would result. live Orange County (neighboring county LA) we're bad. 

I'm living nightmare. Today hospital called told us needed prioritize patients grandmother. They're gonna let die dont resources spare, I'm crushed. I've crying hours can't believe come this. everything told do. Stayed home, distanced, went necessary, yet still got COVID.

People, please wear damn mask stay home. remember reading early admitting airborne transmission would force government provide better protection health workers claimed airborne. probably someone's musings topic. Texas? Ya care trampling people's rights long state prisons stay full execution chair stays warm. time elevator since started surgery. Apparently tried talk letting take stairs. lockdown effect currently Southern California. going on, though maybe 1/3 people follow all. 1/3 follow 100%. latter believe ""one"" social function ""one"" family gathering. 

Somehow (trump) virus became politicized. interesting sad see many people deny covid even exists, point arguing healthcare workers even sick disease. denial strong. 

Yes, local federal government odds many different policies blanket policies. US colleges open spring? I’m college student I’m worried campus town. think? First rule fight club: never admit starting coronavirus. mean, create stricter laws stfu???  Sounds great, cares teens, couple 30 somethings young kids get die. outliers Bob street wants haircut again. 

And yea, hospital workers wont get it, way higher work load, heart attacks slip cracks big deal. 

The group benefits rushing open businesses, gotten aid people... 

I get it, sucks, long time. think going ""open up"" go back ""normal"" mistaken. Things arent ever going rushing doesnt anything put people risk. idea there.

Not saying it’s wrong using 89 year old donor may best example could’ve used. Teachers, retail workers, etc.  

We treating correctly Hell, Jefferson County alone almost many people jail right trials completed per year entire state. Something like 1 5 adults Texas probation parole. system corrupt, force guilty pleas anyone even accused crime. ""Plead guilty I'll make sure get maximum sentence trial!"" common. Fuck Texas criminal justice system. I'm scared :( hospitals completely different floors menis wealthy patients. None surprise anyone. Fuck ccp Based what? fact turned away misplaced paperwork? I'm sure that's convenient excuse China never lies

Had COVID-01 happened instead COVID-19, I'd wager would frame America war... enemy might microscopic, enemy invaded shores nonetheless, healthcare workers front lines. would enough galvanize population, supporting things like mask usage social distancing. december 20 ~91.5k deaths total Sweden. normal year means around 90k. 2017-2018 closer 92k.

Around 255 people die every day december baseline. Even add highest number reported covid deaths per day **on top** (255+80=335) use last 10 days end 95k year total. 

Not quite hellish scenario many others describing earlier 2020, conformished brainwashed.

You April. Wonder gets stock options. shut early fucking shit load people (over 9 times many). dumb feels like I'm getting dumb reading drivel wrote. Shut fuck forever dumbshit. dumb almost want schools open kids end dumb. don’t think so, honestly see people think that. schools open parts state data really good - cases. 

I mean look California - everything fucked. earlier success (meaning overwhelmed hospitals summer) made people think real, bad, spend money make sacrifices. think writers Good Place could get away this. answered question. 1.3m drop bucket, need far vaccinated slow spread keep hospitals swamped. simple. literally parroting responses.

New York accused precious tiers slowing things down. Florida wide open healthcare workers anyone 65 moving quicker.  Reminds joke.

Person hospital: happen die?

Nurse: get bed ready next patient. oxygen supply failed, nothing COULD done.

This first time person hospital died, first time people died COVID. person hospital dies time everyone stop working. fact, person dies hospital there's still lot do. spread rural idiots remember Stanford saying true numbers closer 8x what's reported. Agreed, labor day major holiday start fall know meant say, making joke fact could read land area per square mile would meaningless metric (same population per capita) Interestingly, car accident deaths gone US despite fewer miles driven. Trusting authorities part it, also need authorities know doing.

Might stupidest thing he's said president. need isolate last close contact 21 days ago. 1-5 allergic reactions per 10000 cases Penicillin 100,000 looks pretty good me! can.  That’s science works, there’s 100% guarantee anything, vaccine best thing got rn Ive got question trouble understanding rules say. near family member 1 day fairly close quarters, last time together 21 days ago, tested positive today (I believe tested yesterday, possibly Sunday showing symptoms Saturday). far enough back would exposed, isolate? Damn, dude. That's crazy. suppose max social security retire though, that's something? either. barely follow studies. positive covid test came information test stating may positive. That's understandable, understand doctors experts always get second opinion receiving treatment *(assuming 70% population)* freaks hear doctor could wrong, science pan out. Scientists like bunch kids trying solve puzzle. There's naturally gonna inconsistencies, hiccups disagreements determination relentless. Stay safe! anyone give insight rapid nasal antigen test? I’ve heard doesn’t go far back PCR, mean it’s nostril? I’m trying say SII agreed concession rate 200 ₹ per dose (compared 1000 ₹ ) GoI wants even cheaper. comply regulations? way. Would work? Yeah, would probably fine.

Definitely better dying zero oxygen. doesn’t, lot people US don’t realize first vaccine approved wasn’t actually funded OWS.  Still better source China curious thoughts resident home chooses get vaccinated. go back forth topic interested discussion. see point trying make, residents nursing home vaccinated, shouldn’t protected? staff chooses get vaccinated wears PPE patients, change thinking? resident chooses get vaccinated, asked leave facility? live Ireland got answer Google. live there.

lol unreasonable assumption. Medical gases codes really strict.  More...welcome SoCal :( appreciate experience. Side effects *can* happen, seizure one *very rare* side effects happen DTAP vaccine. husband consult doctor vaccinating COVID vaccine.

The risk serious side effects COVID vaccine *far far* less risk *death* (let alone serious illness) COVID. rate Western world acquiring transmitting SARS-CoV-2, extremely unlikely able avoid infection indefinitely without vaccination. urge please reconsider stance consult doctor concerns vaccination. husband cannot vaccinate vaccinating make safer. Boris literally said TV would could... also Gov website. 

The entire country matter teir could mix least Christmas day. Nobody knows future, think we'll see numerous new variants coming weeks months. Variants may many mutations British variant. obviously cannot vaccine resistance barely started vaccinating, tens millions infected millions vaccinated partial immunity, would surprising hosts virus mutates evades vaccine.

I worry combination low-efficacy vaccine together 1-shot vaccination strategy new variants could result limited immunity numerous hosts, virus may evade vaccine. Nope, flu immunity lasts lifetime, known current viruses immunity lasts six 24 months.

Measles infection leads life long immunity. confirmed DEATHS, even close death! amount people got Covid, vaccinated, would least 75000k dead people. (15mil vaccinated, 0.5%ifr- low estimate people given vaccine high-risk individuals, like 200k-500k saved lives) Target 100 million shots, 50 million people. clear whether holiday bump actually caused lessening restrictions.

Cases still half November peak. would unusual see another peak magnitude. state seen curve like close time.  children can’t provide immoral. Yes, possible patients may died time coincidence due hospital running lout oxygen, however, first time hospital Egypt countries, poor heath services, run oxygen. Even UK US heard hospitals running low. plausible died due lack oxygen.

Here's Yes we've got 12 times population, we've got considerably 12 times number cases...

A lot people said NZ's approach simply work started. - over-reacting, would much impact country, impossible control spread etc.

It's true we're bigger connected NZ are. maybe strategy worked quite well there. we'd courage take similar approach, would almost certainly worked *vastly* better debacle we've got now. teenager gets weakened arteries Covid dies stroke 50s, Covid get credit? vaccines forever. 

Also, now, long lasting vaccine Corona virus. Crazy it, apparently we're taking seriously comparison US. Moses: one plague. way old people talk, believe Wendy's building set fire equal least one 9/11. There's pandemic. People dying. 

A study UK showed teachers 300% likely get covid general population. 

In person school recommended community spread control. Even person there's way real teaching works (no cooperative learning, labs, paper even recommended, places atrocious class sizes can't spread out, teachers wear lots ppe safe, etc etc, ""business usual"")

Sorry sorry teachers value LIFE risk restrictions person learning. little opinion piece nothing convince otherwise. angry anti union guy mouthing frankly that's worthless. 100x? long run talking? Like 500 years? frustrating long-term study disease requires patients ten years ago.

We really wait find long immunity lasts, long aftereffects last. Plenty nurses? sure that? Everywhere desperately needs deal surge right now. FDA regulations prevent advertised prevent spread proven. people already forgot China actively major international investigation find source/origin Covid? Like, news. 

Also, year. Like WTF. moderators remove ""Good News"" flair then?  opposed China news? 🤣🤣🤣 even better, internet! seen cheap vaccine us compared western countries? 
This why, scale India vaccinate along state healthcare system compared developed countries poses much harder challenge. 
Have faith country. Lol even bother reading? really take time actually read post commenting. 🤣 likely due British diplomats, given broke lorry drivers Europe stopped getting lorry cabins. Antarctica zero COVID deaths. awful hate country much.”

Amazing. Captain Hindsight Nope I’d call justice. people ready call people ones haven’t got it. Better 4 million people get super correct order 30 million people get timeframe Maybe normal keep patients attached monitors they've passed coincidence died short timeframe. healthcare, absolutely everywhere. know healthcare held higher standard things information readily available thrown everyone's faces prevent spread ignore it. reality western society created generations people taught ""win"" others special. Everyone thinks know better, everyone thinks happen them, everyone thinks exception, everyone thinks minor inconvenience big deal. easy get mad rich fucks like guy let's honest rich poor living like exception rules.

Our whole society built people, that's we're go pandemic hard way instead success places like Taiwan.

Even province, we're poor + low population lucky barely affected pandemic (1-2 cases per days, often 0) happened? Everyone traveled holidays held New Years parties, 30+ cases yesterday today, blow probably hundreds day next week.

This pandemic really made lose respect way millions people choose live. lot people would've previously considered imagine success entrepreneurs people engaged building better life themselves, etc see today unable follow basic rules see people need things attention time. People unable settle follow simple rules months year putting vain wants forefront even put others' lives risk explained second part comment read it. lot people without jobs soon would guess.  upvote downvote buttons make echo chamber effect even worse. Posts reflect worldview sub rise top presented authoritative, posts reflect different worldview get silenced. Eventually, people get downvoted time leave sub set own, effect happens reverse.

And also manipulated deliberate misinformation purposes. example, posts sub paint China bad light sometimes get dozens downvotes within hour posted, ensuring they're less visible. move people capitol. rest use? Get f---- make clear statement meant descriptive, normative. entirely possible actually mutated somewhere else. We've fucked load things UK, lot sequencing work outbreaks everything, could well spotted rather came here.

A lot sequencing outbreaks Ebola Sars done Looks like know vaccines work. Vaccines *do* stop spread inducing herd immunity. little research vaccines work. Vaccines stop vaccinated person getting ill. vaccinated person immunity, therefore spread virus. dog's rabies vaccine protect him, protects anyone might get bitten him. actually believe experts know that? medical epidemiological degrees didn't. take 0.2% population short run, could see 10 even 100x long run. Obviously perfect getting complete extinction, quite reasonable score virus doesn’t someone actively evolving symptoms. choice choose work somewhere involve close contact risk portion population. April 8th December 17th. Odds favor reinfection. Additionally, individual symptomatic times. compare political systems determining lockdown restrictions, though. primary concern article, yes?  No, correct. *solely* saving lives US citizens. I, US citizen, willing sacrifice family someone country illegally live. restrictions likely last least another month two. assume you’re able get approved it’s matter securing flight going paperwork quarantine schedule. Unfortunately, say many died. hospital claimed oxygen shortage 4 died, 4. Personal anecdote; 

I work near restaurant people (including officers) eating inside every morning. day Christmas Eve absolutely packed. far gyms, even supposed closed, ignoring orders. live Northern California area. Even job booked. 

After left first lockdown California, never really went back on. see plenty people months. even personally know people never stopped mingling households.

From see social media LA area people never stopped partying mass amounts. sure going though, factors, ect. Anyway, started good nothing actually enforced, one gives shit; it’s smoke mirrors. report things, one comes. least experience. Time move somewhere freedom valued then. May suggest Venezuela? perhaps Yemen?

As happens, I'm climate scientist. Shall go likely mechanism death children? tell age give likely cause. Fuck everything humanity done freedom last 50 years.

You c-a-n-n-o-t run physical reality. Atlantic bubble. Vietnam definitely another level testing quarantine enforcement are. we're tightest North America tight without revolt right wing nut jobs. restrictions strict enough prevented unrestricted community transmission big deal sitting American powder keg. Yeah 3 months ago. Millions gone back normal Wonder real reason snowbird neighbours heading next week. far discovered case us traveler. It’s here.  livestream ICUs really. vaccinated everyone age 65 (which soon) deaths double, triple, whatever. Remember, close 0 risk death someone healthy age 65 barring form undiagnosed health issue. steady line graph. Industry Information says enough vaccine mass inoculations domestically, including 100 million doses ahead Lunar New Year. 
 China also agreed provide vaccines large number countries, remains unclear exports handled. 
 

Hope decent quality vaccine, like western ones. moved Florida California late September it’s astonishing differently they’re handling compared end results know, purely hypothetical based virus extremely hazardous younger age group. point certain point might preferable individual risk small chance death. Lmao agreed, t4 phages look like little space craft landing moon. Bitcoin king yeah countries booked/bought ~20-80% charges 3 pharmaceutical companies, often options more. 
Pfizer seems bit overwhelmed now... 
But vaccines got approval too, another mRNA based one soon 2 traditional antigen based vaccines introduced markets. It'll fall vaccine unless something catastrophic happens unlikely. definitely feel whole “mind fog” thing, super depressed, sleeping, genuinely feel plain dumber since infection back August.

It’s really hard decipher much actual effect virus, much amplified depression stress quarantine. actually good news, considering TURTLE LIKE PACE vaccination rollout US extremely frustrating. I’m fucking ready get damn thing already. No. her-bay. Well targeted hard lockdowns work island works.

I know practice pick ""a side"" scream, absurd think people would actually want learn something come here. worse parts things like forced VAT floor - eventually forced 20% VAT across EU, restrictions ""state aid"" can't nationalise companies (but already nationalised/subsidised like France/Germany fine!), Eurozone rollout, etc. - taking economic control away member nations.

It's like run benefit German businessmen. focus that, rather building floor working conditions across EU, i.e. Ireland paid sick leave still, bailouts forced Spain disallow self-certification sick leave, disaster pandemic, etc.

It 100% fatal, could impurity worse? Australia learned First Aid classes “triage” “reverse triage”.  Different countries may different terminology also. 

As u/Scrub_Kincaid said, it’s bad situation normal triage swapped combat/reverse triage.

It means don’t enough resources treat everyone, prioritise save treatment, likely die. worst cases may get morphine treatment reverse triage, ie left die. Guess didn’t read article. successful using vaccine doses, seems like mostly high priority people got them. mentioned article, hardest part paper work. grab random people street, need record details make sure get second dose later appropriate timing. countries already. UK ""just"" retaliating.   everyone close border non needed travel Ok ok need rub in. least wait us Americans free fall It’s like Office episode Micheal Scott explains complicated system marking emails important important ones marked caps titles. prioritised “the government” health authorities Stop tier system begin series mass vaccinations nationwide. Seriously, it’s much better idea tiered system people even eligible don’t want get it. say let’s cut bullshit let everyone wants fucking vaccine able get soon possible. think anti-mask movement nothing increased infection rates? Yeah, given USA capitalist, sounds like capitalist arrangements me,

No idea commentor felt throw communism there, vaccine manufacturers say need take 2 doses. really tryna go whats recommended new vaccine? thanks ill follow instructions writtencom box. would say even deny airport access I'm fucking news anchor TV. I'm daily discussion thread reddit. comments absurd learn humans emotions. real answer here. Everything done protect general public half-assed. Canada actually banked believe 3 different vaccines. even logistics deploy vaccine planet wide certainly daunting task. corona shy wont get smaller rooms tragedy! 
It's shame government tries hide happened there. definitely make good argument EUA better case. Calling faffing shitting whatever good argument though, makes sound like someone know he's talking venting ranting. ordered many, received them. issue Pfizer cannot manufacture quick enough demand. Mainly due complexity manufacture process compared Astrazeneca vaccine read article, understand - nowhere article say apply visa. article clearly states China knew happening, agreed it, refusing issue visas 

follow simple logic indicates least suspicious - actually basic acting like hold key information 'they even apply' ffs... Even true, could issued one let they... Fool currently worst outbreak country, I’ve read CovidActNow’s metrics cases per 100k. Lol even cases didn’t they? majority states Australia seen little community transmission COVID since May What? Regulate travel? I, Section 8, Clause 3 US [The Congress shall Power] regulate Commerce foreign Nations, among several States, Indian Tribes; Might something African strain. implement though?

Spain needs within 72 hours test time, that's hard fulfill many places give results time frame (i.e. time perfectly).

So practice essentially closing borders circumstances. Brexit changes top, might best plan right now. I’m Brit living Singapore, gutted go home see family (haven’t able leave island year) happy I’m living shit show. one form another lockdown year so, whilst hiccup start worker dorms everything almost back normal. 

As someone else mentioned willingness local population follow rules what’s made achievable. fuck heads U.K. big parties wearing masks/seeing people shouldn’t ruined whole country. It’s spreading, let’s real. Nobody surprised variant faster spreading US. guarantee hundreds thousands people already moment America. Failures every level leadership allows get control, mention lack empathy denialism amongst large percentage population.  implementing surge response develop ambulance receiving spaces hospitals. intended climate-controlled spaces EMS offload patients. 
 
So, holding areas limited care: 
 medical officer duty 24/7 help consult terms identifying critical patients getting hospital quickly possible 
 
So people die holding area stead ambulance. *really* solve problem, moves one place other. 

The findings prompted urgent reminder researchers: Getting flu shot protect infection may also reduce risk serious complications.

Researchers first study found flu increase odds stroke almost 40 percent -- added risk remains full year. prefer something little bit noise. research station Antarctica shouldn’t really count. lol. 

seriously, always going outliers pandemic, given enough time even win covid lottery. fair, GDP figures far slightly better rest West. Fully agree. sub rock hard permanent lockdowns isolation though prepare downvoted. 

The damage caused lockdowns unfairly put lowest risk people - collectively society decided we’re ok destroying education socialization skills critical time kids lives. 

“But want kill grandma” “education worthless they’re dead!!1” - fuck off. Cases never zero. Life zero risk. cannot keep destroying peoples lives businesses forever least idiot supporting brain drain poorer countries order compensate failures prepare richer countries. conditional market approvals made less stringent middle _emergency_. can't hide behind ""bureaucracy"" ""how process works"" EU disastrously behind vaccination fire sides it. better faster. I'm seriously shocked little people expect governments institutions. I've said before, delays (worldwide, EU especially bad offender) shitting incredible work scientists done.  Pretty self evident idiot commenting, guess upside self isolation social distancing childishly insult strangers without worry getting punched teeth lol Hopefully agree within Rule 8. think it’s helpful share information viral infections health impacts beyond acute symptoms.

Hoping boosts understanding already studies suggesting virus raise risk severe long-term conditions. poor man look money all... 

The virus free... There's probably individual nurses vaccinated people France. 39-year old care home worker Brabant become first person Netherlands vaccinated coronavirus. Sanna Elkadiri given vaccination mass vaccination centre Veghel  


Good luck, Netherlands. could speed process. anyone realize utterly insane is? Population density (LA county alone 10 million people, entire metro area more), multigenerational households (3-4 generations) crammed 1970s style ranches housing expensive, people don’t care guidelines police reinforcing said guidelines, mistaken belief family okay/safe. 

Oh CA fewer ICU beds per capita many states. people household getting sick sick people due sheer population density bad, bad time there. China confirmed human human locked wuhan. waiting evidence took longest time. colonial hangover that's way it. like 60 people, right?

So proud information, wrote article said 444% can’t find one, probable taken changed. also wasn’t scientific study community statistics analysis cases. Didn’t realize comment would blow up. emergency use allowance practices US UK stringent EU conditional market approvals practices.

I understand frustrating, really need know least tiny bit process works make real criticism. really get government take control hospitals.

Right serious problem there. One hospital crowded, another not...

You clearly need use whole healthcare system 1 organism right now, like done Europe, without taking account owns hospitals insurances. unified system save lifes.

Also sending people regions states really needed right without taking account insurances hospitals ownership. Either ambulance, planes.

Medicalized hotels non icu patients transformation ICU rest beds hospital possible. That's lot money, government better prepare huge budget save people.


Also making masks mandatory everytime outside home, enforcing hard lockdowns, making hand washing mandatory entrance exit every businesses, lot police enforce lockdown appropriately.

Maybe paying people 80% salary can't work, like Europe, would also help enforce lockdown. Scientists political offices?

Impossible! Don’t know downvoted implying anything all. seems atleast Latinos tend live family members others. normal house hold could like mom dad 3 kids grandma grandpa. Apocalyptic images. Right Stock market oddly continue climb long stimulus money goes due inflation... actually make stimulus receivers poor long run, unfortunately. continue rise everything gets wide open again. always crashes, combination unprecedented money printing rapid recovery actually perfect recipe rocketing markets.

Source: idea, shit I've read maybe buddy told me, can't remember Dead people pay taxes, course government care. Imagine using word communist argument without irony. get paid isolate? Even US I'm contact traced close contact coworker, would paid stay home isolate. live lifestyle literally zero close contacts outside work. groceries delivered large quantities month, actual contact human. course China won’t let anyone in! anyone surprised allowed they’d probably never seen again. country hungry world domination nuts! take eye ball preoccupied Covid. Blatantly true. Mixing jabs done national emergencies supply low. reasonable percentage vaccinated also received second vaccine.

Keep pushing agenda though deaths plummet. 

That depends spread virus. twice many people catch virus, care home residents among them, still means ICU usage deaths rise. Believe not, heard people say mask leaky, could end ""trapping virus"", thus concentrating closer nose mouth, that's wear masks.

Yeah, I'm sure healthcare workers wearing trying get sick. smdh. needed sacrifice freedom extensive contact tracing. learned countries success like South Korea. country dealt anything like living memory it. OK that's fair enough then. see would Pfizer vaccine. 

Thx link. man tested positive traveled abroad currently isolating home, DPH said statement. Contract tracing done close contact man tested variant well. 

So already spreading communities. second dose exactly de frist? Didnt Canadá like 300% population vaccines? Free enterprise Israel wants territories people. 2.2% year September. Mostly due international tourism shut down. Linda easy 5 million people island really hate happening bad cannot divide land. want live one side don't, seems best defense get vaccines quickly possible,

That late. current exponential growth see UK, solution hard lockdown. best info seen Xenophobic how? ex pats know able get back level 2/3/4 lockdown. would prefer come holiday spread virus country thanks much Ah yeah, irrelevant nitpicking defusing real subject article.

Serbia together Montenegro last stage negotiations join EU. also expect vaccines EU, already purchased small number doses Pfizer evil ruskies paying pocket. is, right thing do, European countries arent EU start solving problems fiercely EU loyal politicians stop talking glorious day future EU accession solve things Macedonia went humiliating step changing name national identity order start EU accession process new hurdles thrown way. Albanian accession process also delayed way beyond reasonable would theoretically take entire generation two countries join, assuming ever happen.

Nobody, neither here, article, wrote former yoguslavian countries emphasis supposed extreme poverty.

Bit topic corrections made Oh man, definitely try tell republicans. 🤯 easy say now, hindsight 20 20 vaccine also protect new strain? think careful crab mentality going here. teachers nonessential retail closed right now. There's nothing particularly special either group.

Your argument basically boils ""why group people get 'x' get 'x'"". better response look try advocate nonessential retail like better working conditions, take away better working conditions another group. control borders. response can't much better worst performing nation.

Saying can't done wrong. New South Wales, Australia land border European country yet states controlled borders borders shut. Even though vast majority intrastate trade done road Australia.

Not able close border failure EU, something can't done. see kind people every often everyone else pretty quick sort out.

A weird one going around among tinfoil hat people recently government building 5G towers spy brainwaves! 😬 COVID October literally like cold, serious symptoms also Asthma. thing made go get tested loss smell. really weird cause never before. Nice. keep freezers failing. Several European countries even higher death rate per capita. UK strain show true power weeks though. Expect 2-3k deaths/day 7-day rolling average.

!RemindMe 4 weeks Oh yes, dabbled beers husband went higher shelf! I’m fine health care first. Particularly actually treating covid patients. problem 60 different groups that. Frontline healthcare age needs happen. Plot twist, France never existed, joke run English since 1066. Trump can't anything neither Biden. president United States reach micromanage every single hospital, clinic, pharmacy country distributes vaccine understand IFR kids COVID literally lower flu right? Also, grade schools drivers, merely correlate community spread 

Then teachers 333% prevalence rates? LOL Vindictive gutter dwelling comment: want someone get sick, call douche obsessed facebook page .  making things worse, better hateful closed-minded approach life. That’s point, isn’t research show long term side effects vaccine hasn’t around long enough. Still wear mask receiving vaccine. want thank NZ, Australia would never got collective shit together folks showing us way first 🙏 Yes unfortunately funeral middle one lockdowns (not covid related), tell many family friends attend.

Getting low numbers makes controllable going back normal means going come back. need control borders implement effective contact tracing come lockdown. That’s 1/17 infected *right moment*. New York’s 20% worst areas total infections something like 2 3 months...

With R0 1 lag time 7 days puts vast majority population infected time NY took get 20%. Don’t forget even lockdown doesn’t stop instantly like NY Wuhan, people newly infected today bringing home spreading families still getting *at least* 1-2 rounds exponential growth extremely stringent measures already taken today. happened méxico too, authorities investigating person released news, responsables failure happens vaccinated someone currently Covid? pandemic also terrible effect mental health, forced people spend even time online echo chambers extremist thinking completely control.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* NY number COVID point. number currently COVID. I'm still struggling put together. gets slammed virus extremely complicated.

A lot places experienced major surge last spring (NY, MA, CT, NJ, etc...) comparatively well, despite lax restrictions CA winter. However, could explain better behavior/attitudes. Nowhere experienced nearly large surge summer, places experienced medium surge summer (FL, TX, etc...) rising now, much slower CA. places experienced major surge Fall (ND, SD, IL, etc...) quickly dropping cases, again, despite less strict restrictions CA.

It makes wonder much immunity playing role. Obviously we're herd immunity anywhere. might ""restriction-adjusted"" herd immunity places hit hard though, takes significantly less restriction keep pandemic control places like NY, MA, NJ (and SD, ND, IL, MI, LA, etc...) slightly less restriction places like FL, TX, AZ, etc... tons restriction CA.

I'm saying we're herd immunity all. open completely, obviously we'll major surges. However, almost predict course pandemic winter depending particular region's history pandemic.

Major surge spring: Small surge winter (NJ, NY, MA, CT, etc...)

Medium surge summer: Surge winter, slower accelerating CA (FL, TX, etc...) 

Major surge Fall: Hospitalizations falling (ND, SD, IL, etc...)

CA one place has, now, avoided major surge. feel like coincidence levees finally broke winter, wound particularly intense.

It seems like way deal virus like early *intense* intervention. Either eliminate essentially bound surge eventually. people lose social distance, imagine we'll catastrophic events waiting, especially areas largely avoided virus far. vaccines can't come quick enough. Yes, culturally mandate survive.  Nut. Or, encounter South African variant. think he's updating prediction regularly track daily averages (to clear, that's good thing - pointing previous predictions us per day now) No. We've started yesterday. surprise all. money buy many things. Measly vaccine big deal considering Pfizer said still sitting vaccine supply state close exhausting supply. ideal, big deal. health care first mistake. already protected gear. inflow hospitals needs stopped that's mostly 60+ israel smartly first. COVID-19 evangelist 

""I'm super spreader. I'm covid evangelist"" Semi-correct: mean deaths.

 deadly (this particular variant) individual yes, deadly society whole, people it,so people die it.

Deaths UK already 30% week ago.

And account ""secondary deaths"" medical issues due overloaded hospitals etc. mean 1/17 (a number extrapolated assumption city reporting) still 6% population infected. 94% still viable get infected, unlike New York estimated 20+% infected. Duh also really well (five cases nationwide yesterday). Exactly! instance: *we hobbits.*  Yeah. pattern seems like crushing pretty hard. Keeping low crushing multiple times even harder.  many possibilities. lot consider comparing countries’ Covid response: population, death rate, density, average age, comorbidities, government response effort. list goes on. It’s difficult pin reasonable confidence all, US isn’t great. country amazing.. tell family couldn’t go funeral cousin, like sister, there’s 150 people going. It’s also area unbelievable amounts cases.... Go USA. /s grown ass adults going act like children give em spongebob bandaid fucking lollipop shot No, separate evolution. share one major mutation, N501Y, otherwise different. appear transmissible.  Yeah, that's plan is. say wants schools open right now. really wish lived New Zealand. anti maskers drive crazy Wonder new variants might raise concern subunit vaccines like Novovax compared ""full spike"" vaccines. Shhh! Don’t give ideas! happen United States numerous places. Egypt apparently Hilarious required reading. Oh yeah. gave up. Even family members. I’m done. It’s kids. Fuck rest. I’m done. Australian state New South Wales better model. initial hard lockdown get initial outbreak control opening back contract tracing control outbreaks. NSW opened June 10 ish new cases day; Completely eliminated community spread virus; Got reinfected July Victorian response fell apart; Eliminated community spread November without going back lockdown. NSW currently dealing new outbreak due hotel quarantine leak back single digit infections per day.

NSW's response kept economy going people able live lives mostly would have. NZ's response effective repeatedly locking destroy business confidence long term. all. used shortest reasonable time period could complete trials quickly possible.  agree 100%. Fauci we’re busy fighting proud boys. course is. government ""first"" discovers virus, already spread everywhere. Israel isn’t sending vaccines Jordan, Egypt, Iran either. Well darn sucks huh Well really talking healthcare workers elderly.  NY probably healthcare workers total number people living ND.  point still stands. easier vaccinate less people.  BTW hospitals ND going distributed state wish could lose bad right I'm chill. selectively quoted source support unsupportable conclusion. We're making progress, let's ok? sit back month see verdict (and Fauci's) support sticking ""the science"" (supposed science) 28 day inter dose delay. I'm predicting Fauci's (and your) position widely discredited. please feel free get back ""I told so"". think worse you. think worse keep attempting win argument posting walls text nothing new them. ""Intuitive thinkers"" vs ""analytical thinkers"" 

Intuitive thinkers trust gut, go instinct, etc. Analytical thinkers trust data expert input. Yeah really understand teach people.

Need qualified people vaccinate? Teach pay well. see would issue. ""US would reached 55,721""

Your math seems off... think supposed around 6000. Maybe don’t want people die needlessly vaccinations rolled out.

I finally realizing discernment completely non-existent people think binary terms. year information virus, still get comments like “ guys want world locked forever.” rude ask people grow up? saying. scary movies. *denies study massive list self admitted anecdotes*

Bro When's next phase coronavirus vaccine? type 2 diabetes qualify get sooner? year ago hospital due double pneumonia respiratory distress syndrome 3 weeks medically induced coma 4 days. Im fully healed it. month Corona virus started. qualify get vaccine sooner? Also work dog kennel, considered essential workers? deal clients travel country outside county drop pick pets. qualify sooner? Im 35 way. wild important lessons learn encapsulated silly little stories like that. 11 hours first Moderna shot. arm really sore, hurts like hell move around. Luckily I’m still able duties job without much trouble, especially since asked jab non-dominant arm. side effects I’m experiencing fatigue mild headache, neither gotten worse past 4-5 hours so. Pretty much going expected far! think we'd need everyone get vaccine stop pandemic? believe US leaving Iraq good? Didn’t Europe sign new trade deal China? Like, seems like world isn’t much despite reported feelings China. Biden likely follow suit. idea we're per day. states report weekly.  thaw come. Seriously. Might get ugly though. think things 85 90% normal summer.

Between good portion population getting vaccinated seasonal drops infections think start seeing low amounts deaths hospitalizations. Pro Life folk weird. agree, silly. phase 3 even governments going thing? 

If we're going start experimenting doses scheduling, without worrying affecting effectiveness, started taking vaccine candidates last summer soon proven safe generate antibodies. waited months see effectiveness specific regiment, throw window? Never complain money going basic research, ignorance beginning knowledge. already see somewhat people’s word choice. People don’t say “we need temporarily restrict operations business emergency”, rather “you right operate business could put someone risk”. 

I think there’s big difference statement implies, latter statement could used many situations former. i'm confused - mean people teeth problems diet? 

i'm talking grow weird angles, impacted, close together, one way higher teeth, etc. basically lots stuff cause pain make harder actually use teeth, there's evolutionary advantage result individual's lifestyle. modern dentistry treat kinds issues also shows teeth integral survival. opinion wrong. Sometimes delaying strategy defense. Especially guilty. think they're called CCP. really going tank man video? Would love unbiased context it. I'm pharm tech got first dose day Christmas eve. get mine next week you. Arm felt like someone punched day, woke day getting shot mild fatigue. heard second shot make show little symptoms like that, I'll take getting covid since I'm higher risk. Good explanation. regularly-scheduled shots two lines: people appropriate tier appointments bunch people standby. I’d happy standby wait nearby parking lot 20 minutes away local provider long. sure is. Alex Trebek Sean Connery? Yes, yes is. hell time write book leading one nations powerful states crippling pandemic?  US plans follow science.... good 12 months late, better late never. Yes, but... probably impractical many companies concerned avoiding lawsuits unpleasant consequences taking stand people consider controversial personal matters. pay starvation wages provide benefits time off, one concern improving society.

Billy McFarland still trying promote FyreFest _after_ everybody saw FEMA tents. Remote learning become new normal probably.  sister’s kids go back tomorrow. schools shitty job remote learners, plus they’re saying high schoolers school get letter grades next semester, they’re remote get pass/fail  Yeah agree here. Perhaps give elderly (65+) extremely high risk age ""VIP line"" sorts enough vaccine confidently available general public. Ohio, also prioritizing teachers along groups, hopes safer person learning starting March 1st. think get March April, barring approval J&amp;J perhaps couple others, general public access reservation system. Keep mind limiting amount tiers specific groups people easiest way vaccinating Americans. Furthermore, efficient feasible, terms finances ethics. Although may see uniform decrease hospitalizations, every vaccine counts; matter arm elderly man, arm teenage grandson. Let's end confusing prioritizations move fuck forward.  imagine main problem 1.3M vaccinated wont get full immunization almost month (3 weeks Pfizer think 4 weeks AZ) 6 weeks seem irrational account small number people getting vaccinated also small number people actually getting immunization.

I could completely wrong lol. virus preview. Pfizer moderna approved 7 days results believe There’s dope pension Illinois keep it. vaccinate enough get need take 275 days Sounds good me. Oh, I'm sorry. Here's hoping everyone stays well. much. Good luck! Kind makes question politicians pushing shutdown. Additional context: peak, Israel vaccinating 150k people per day. issue 21 days approach since first vaccine administered (in 4 days), Israel must pivot giving second dose vaccine rate first dose given. first doses continue given, manpower must found give new first doses second doses returning patients.

The EMA require detailed information vaccine produced standards ensure vaccine produced high quality ect. also requires thorough inspection facilities. far I'm aware information provided Astrazeneca.

From Ingham County, precisely clear many hospital emergency workers declined vaccine. based survey among health department staff national surveys, appears 1 3 health workers declining coronavirus vaccine now, according Linda Vail, county's health officer. would shocked said this, given (basically) president...those guys traditionally start terms promising administration continue ongoing colossal fuckup Remember Trump [pointed New Zealand's whopping 9 cases proof poorly US containing it? virus spreads exponentially. Half-assed health measures produce quarter-assed results. 170 PCR confirmed covid-19 cases, split 8 162 vaccine placebo 3410 total cases suspected, unconfirmed covid-19, 1594 occurred vaccine group vs. 1816 placebo many suspected cases people false negative PCR test result, would dramatically decrease vaccine efficacy.

So he's suggesting ""many most"" PCR false negative quota?

Shouldn't mention Moderna 30 0 severe cases? Im sorry go something like that, must really awful. Hope get trough bad take, like can't learn adapt good strategies country. Even South Korea's CDC borrow elements USA's CDC combat outbreak.

If insist want non-island isolated countries examples ..

Vietnam(1,305 cases; 35 deaths)

Liberia (1,779 cases; 83 deaths)

Finland (37,218 cases; 576 deaths) still thing resources constrained. mean, yeah, it’s “made up,” it’s reason. need actually staff beds skilled workers nearly 24/7.

Unless literally arguing getting physical beds hospitals bottleneck lies? church speaker phone finaces best. None real faith, convincing people en masse. Modern US Christianity exactly old Vatican: greed. One county population greater 40 states. lockdowns without enforcement joke title wrong. drugs market help symptoms Ivermectin? first case COVID-19 diagnosed US January 20th. mandatory quarantines upon re-entry started day. Instead started “screening” airports basically temperature checks health questions everyone entering experienced. travel restriction Feb. 2 foreign nationals traveling Mainland China. mandatory quarantines testing upon arrival. I'm shooting think. can't make full herd immunity fall. want another spring/summer thrown away.

I still wear mask take basic precautions seeing friends family stops spring gets assuming things getting better worse. would hear dare vaccinate healthcare workers first, since ill afford lose them. mention daily risk high. 

Bright side, think get 65 older crowd next two weeks basically everywhere. hopefully short term issue. everyone... serious? Administering vaccine literally simple sticking needle someone’s arm. could train random person hour Ack, right, got stories mixed up.

In US kept going school. cure cash injections. Totally agree - healthcare workers don’t want - time move on. Shots need get arms. rich people cutting line make deployment faster purple need is? higher household income US mean money working families paid leave access affordable childcare. life translate fast food too. Movie theaters? going movie theaters this. theaters worry vaccine card.

I haven’t movie theater last three years guy farted right face got up.over Office President Elect reason. latest plan fight COVID. Increase federal leadership positions accelerate vaccinations. seems obvious, seen surge people receiving training administering vaccines.  think trying say this: Since supplier medically approved, would illegal use tanks / oxygen. problem, right? better dying. 

But something happen? impurity people die? Common sense would say: well theyre cut corners, lack alternatives. Legal stuff lawsuit would say: weeeelllll, see malpractice huge payouts. 

So would perhaps easier use lifesaving methods noone gets sued.

is morally ethically wrong? Yes! Definitely. 

Could see happening? yeah. Yeah, let’s keep workers run food system getting vaccinated. There’s way end badly. wife teacher students low-income. assumption wealthy parents hesitant send kids school incorrect. provinces following rules invade(moving low case counts)

Hey happened state Brazil. shut soon cases (up april-may), close airports main roads federal jurisdiction. People entire country came organize illegal parties we're pretty fucking screwed. seems plausible explanation. 2021 telling 2020...hold beer = ( People concerned vaccine skepticism, main thing that's putting people friend group rushing get doom gloom predictions news going change much.

A Pfizer board member news today saying we'll never cram 1000s people room ever again, talked post-9/11-style new normal. criminal so? Cause Death: Covid-19 wrong odds would disproportionately affect poor people disproportionately non-white. Unfortunately maintaining current socioeconomic paradigm greater importance million human chattels dying life expectancy significantly impacted. It’s always good expert opinion, shit. soon discovered, reasonable person expected already spread around globe. wonder many countries US embargo medical supplies. make great disease reservoir. Reminds bike meme general population sucks general blame politicians. Politicians suck well, extension citizenry. “Little Jimmy reportedly going fail math test! Sell sell sell!!!” fact going people instead healthcare workers yes would problem. 

But doubt that’s case. Hospital doses need. healthcare workers refusing take it. Every vial extra doses must used timely fashion. one get end wasted. 

So rich guy wants drop money hospitals account get vaccine it’s wasted see problems. 

Hospitals country huge financial issues. run funds even worse off. 

Our hospital hundred doses sitting around nurses refusing take it. End day need rich people vaccinated like need poor people vaccinated. Instead sitting vaccine nothing get people vaccinated! Excess mortality averaged something like 10% mid March end April, spike 21% mid August, gradual rise mid October. doom gloom feeling today. lack vaccinations, anti vaxxers, SA variant feels like never going away. can't live like much longer. virus turned life upside want get back track. want see friends family again. Please tell actually go away. know disappear overnight anything seriously can't another year let alone 5 months point.  It’s definitely widespread rate places finding new strain(like 8 total entire country) suggest driving surge cases. Even though US sequences 0.5% cases would enough see new strain cause surge.

I think it’s easier blame new boogeyman rather behavior. It’s Newsom, whole country failing use vaccine timely manner. 21M know COVID, we'll end vaccinating top much ever know COVID.

And forcing COVID back line (I'm passing judgment decision, please take task this), even 21M confirmed cases going among early rounds vaccination. billionaires iirc Dudecati? Abducting refugee children parents border putting cages pretty hateful. 

You mean policy set place Obama ? check Worldometer projections tells cases definetly go March matter wear masks, restrictions lifted unrelated vaccine rollout.

Why? cases seemingly naturally going then? someone explain? think Wuhan microscopes tracking pandemic last year? listen science...I'm pretty good tracking across different media stories. pandemic first time I've this. ~~Here’s one one meant agree. Federal response sucked mean... that’s pretty typical LA, pandemic It’s California, problem around country plans prioritize higher risk groups look good paper failing reality.  Well, feel fair, argue case Judge Covid. I'm sure they'll reconsider. case able link research easily. I'd love see it. sad I'm pretty sure already known. Meat workers amazon packing staff work around confirmed people virus political opportunity crush opponenents spread fake unscientific news

Tell democrats. goes ways. Yesterday someone got quite upvotes saying mRNA vaccines use years. Um, what? Fuck GOP horse rode on.  


The best analogy think like drunk driver who's managed cause accident others killed, though analogy may injured, drunk driver trying help allocation/direction EMT's medical assistance. FUCK THAT. 


P.S. Fully expect comment get deleted 'political' use *fricken' actual title* 'GOP'. American exceptionalism. I'd say degree Oxford Cambridge. Elite universities global recognition. Oxford degree value US, Harvard degree value England Sweden. makes NZ unique college degrees exactly same? Source? one true source data article linked. “sources” merely sliced diced number trial suit whatever wanted. would even want teacher right now? matter healthcare private state, expensive free, hospitals full Covid patients (and doctors nurses ill) trouble. Yet people see this. ton costs could fall ""stitch time saves nine"", replacement human capital.

A restaurant tends pretty tight margins, people feel safe going out, even small percentage them, business able sustain itself. little bit cash keeps business going government soon gone percentage people comes back, business goes government spent money little benefit.

Many folks reliant government medical services, especially danger major complications, person goes hospital weeks, many thousands dollars(many) bills resources government pay for... cost hell lot people home.

and yes, even ill workforce shuts place month rolling basis cause massive problems. It’s strange.

Whenever restrictions loosened, cases go up. What’s going on?? So, people listen follow? 24 hours first Moderna shot side effect remaining sore arm. headache, chills, fatigue yesterday, although headache subside bed. Feeling fine today though. Every step way pandemic, happy talk bullshitters 100% base. Fully agree. part. government needs “guide” us apparently people can’t figure touching people dirty hands sharing spit pandemic good idea. 

People want sacrifices magical fix “the government” Sure agree. type approach top messaging they're probably would associated action well. 

But end day truth we'll never know 🤷‍♂️ read whole article...not cherry pick. human immunity too. meds.

And caused pandemic beat Trump left call China get release virus get nations hoax Sleepy J could get elected way Nancy Pelosi could deem medically unfit way Kamala Harris(who even grow America!) could become president. said government sucks. agree you. handled better. we're going see civil litigation pick pieces dust years come. NY happened quickly nobody even knew care ration. death rate high. know much treat issues improve outcomes. overwhelmed areas NY kind specific buffer. NY complete lockdown nothing confused quiet regions stayed quiet. think even medical help unaffected states basically states drowning. re-educated. makes wonder much time money we’d save westerners started wearing masks felt sick... couldn’t wrong. 
Plenty diseases infective days leading symptom development. Welcome reddit 50% users american therefore everything brought back comparison that. like leave guess Why? can’t even answer know sure, unlikely vaccinated people transmit virus, much point wearing mask.

*But* also seems unlikely stores going ask front door employees check individual people's vaccination cards we're probably going blanket rules asking everyone wear masks foreseeable future otherwise everyone claim vaccinated whether actually not. Funny, reading first comment thought ""This sure sounds like district fiance teaching last year.""

Sure enough, exurbs Houston. yeehaw.

What's worse district gives distance learners self-guided material, actual district teachers. I'm sure lessons workload actual teachers, students essential deterred taking healthy precautions risk falling behind. model vaccine distributed based personal wealth, risk contribution society. believe wealth accurate measure person's potential contribution so, would anyone bother becoming nurse first responder? 

Throwing money bloated unsustainable business model charity sidestepping rules created ensure first responders protected noble. open appointments expanding people eligible receive it.  count enlightened redditors took undergrad biology classes think know scientists. China indeed wanted cooperate visa would cleared spot. He’s scrappy one. also pointless compare without weighting factors like age comorbidity. Ah thank you. Experts believe vaccinated people express protective IgA mucous membranes, allowing virus replicate shed mucous membranes. equals population happy spreaders idea brewing (and disseminating) virus nose respiratory tract. Someone tell FDA MHRA follow well established science, evidently best found blog, backed decisions respectively. New Zealand truly inspiring country. can't wait visit someday nightmare over. UK mutation UK week eh? Well suppose thing happened America lol. much stupid BS keep track last year smh Keep mind businesses also put lots shields extraordinary cleaning measures. Every cart gets cleaned go grocery store target. happened before, wonder percentage flu transmission cart door handles. read article even person cut paste article, would know freezer malfunctioned. weren’t planning many shots short time frame (2 hours). It’s actually great logistics able move quickly enough use them. Unless access full report link provides zero information March 2019 virus contagious haha, attempting argue circulating 10 months throughout world finally picked China? maybe false-positive/contamination?? Shock awe. Fuck America Grown ups aware governments crystal ball predict future exactle.

You're taking government statements like 5 year old takes statements parents. 

Like tell kid going beach Saturday, cancel rains, kid goes ""BUT PROMISED WAAA WAAA."" wonderful carried yellow book past 5 years. travelled Australia, America, Europe Africa going leaving asked show yellow book vaccines. sound scary sound great currently checked vaccines need travel doubt different! did. people care trying. people don't, well care. No, really. don’t long term safety studies new flu vaccine year. platform technology used, it’s adapted years circulating strains. 

Same could done mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Modena) presumably viral vector ones (AZ/J&amp;J). county Georgia suspended almost court proceedings months end. know several people currently Divorce Limbo cases got put hold also know someone whose adoption case got put hold. believe amount ""lost paperwork"" keep reading people middle legal proceedings Covid hit arr trying start things back up. mess. hate rich fucks. maybe instead fighting them. open it? Got $10,000 donate fund pay ppls rent? Want vaccine?

Pay 10k per shot  Ah yes, peaceful region prior 2001. I'm sorry, hope Grandma pulls &lt;3 course Texas. treat COVID like little cough here. disaster. Cue racists hoped American Indians killed genocide.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* country outside us means shit Americans E484 already demonstrated neutralized polyclonal antibodies. get idea aren’t following cdc protocols US schools? states aren’t mandating masks least. 

U.K. masking 12 hybrid. read protocols online. Teachers weren’t even required wear them. gave vaccine back November it’s deep state secret point think /u/ExCivilian trolling. Sue state failing provide education, state funds education. blame you, hard self destructible here. sense, he's right. last thing need kids lock force nothing internet means public expression. hand already interact online without pandemic. tips balance here, kids social, physiological even learning disabilities benefiting without structures public schooling provides. know makes kids susceptible actions id call domestic terrorism others would label socially inadequate, awkward insane. 

As teachers, state takes legal liability. believe teachers continue show there's true table meeting school sitting one side along teachers side sits state attorney generals state reps. problem can't solved negotiating bottom. Since can't talk politics, president decency term try fix education problem implemented sticker system rewarded schools higher testing. schools highest test scores states mostly small, suburban middle class school districts. schools need resources bigger public schools well testing. failed reform put place way back reasoning beyond lack resources teachers, help. issue political. teachers risk life political decision, forced this. 

States allow schools decide want handle pandemic, students teachers able leads strike CBA, it. district decision give in. They're lucky teachers protesting pay should, mean c'mon barely that. Chile surge cases (with light lockdowns places strict lockdown places, mandatory mask usage everywhere outside household etc etc) middle summer, without crazy temperatures southern US AC common. suppose covid gets easier manage summer definitely seasonal That’s I’m thinking. 
I’ve careful past year.  Damnit Texas! think general idea virus created better understand make vaccines them. used tool issue protocols keeping lab complete shit someone took home them.  one theories floating around. USA, every country world worse dealing covid are. /s  Order national fucking lockdown, stupid. conservative media couple weeks ago wasn’t picked mainstream media. It’s suspicious China publicly saying virus originate China. I’m sorry. us weeks March April. It’s haunting memory. Stay safe! Corruption? Straight Jail. imagine?!

""What's flavor month?""
""Let's see..... peanut butter!""
""Yaaaay!!"" Fauci said people probably weddings June July week ago. think May 30 close enough June within prediction. postponed mine May 1 fall, 100 people vaccine mass rollout April, May 1 seemed cusp. ok masks people joining remotely feel comfortable traveling? so, think ok. Current estimates 18 years vaccinate US population current speed. Damnit Texas! 3.27%... one knows low. Still bunch folks refusing it. would gladly take shot know post on? please wear face shield mask lot people hiding going feel skittish general public re-emerge world, regardless safe actually are

This depends lot guest list. know guests frothing mouth party lol. Ive multiple people tell theyd get tested wear hazmat suit said thats wanted. sewar guests excited are. fiance seem people skeptical happen. 

It also help many risk guests. Mostly grandmothers FMIL, vaccinated early spring. Everyone pretty fit, almost older family members actually covid already (And fine, thankfully - think odd people know covid 55+). 

Basically, count May. Think plan C, D, E (since B already!), also set deadlines pull trigger them. soft trigger early Feb, hard trigger early March, example. Also think dealbreakers ask venue make decisions (example: ok US wear masks, dgaf anyone else wear them). 

Happy help. like talking people boat. Reddit loves say ""just postpone!!"" really easy most. ESPECIALLY 9+ months. tells wars really bad. think there's way give exact odds.

It's greater zero astronomically high. hugged hundred people fiance's indoor funeral summer never caught virus; others got getting haircut front open window.  didn’t know better, I’d say China something hide. heard Surprise, no. Anger? Hell yeah! BayNews9 ran report said fake EventBrite queues people charging money vaccinations—watch smart Wow people suck. lower age anytime. Everyone knows thier age hardly barrier.

Look FL open 65 plus demand issue goes away ( people sleeping parking lots trying get it) reason wear mask outside im lazy. figure store mask walk different shops annoying... Ended December 31 ☹️ Makes wonder California hospital who’s freezer went alarm didn’t sound actually sabotage. barriers throw up, slower distribution going be. Personally think models likely overestimate many people got little people got interact didn’t. Overestimating many people already got COVID pretty huge.

Reinfections aren’t question though, don’t think they’re likeliest explanation yet.  like banana. Natural immunity vaccine immunity merge point. We’ll get faster think. Sorry work immune compromised vulnerable people obligation get vaccinated something common flu. want vaccines? Fine another career path. Yes. South African mutations previous lab evidence defeated antibodies.

The hope vaccine target virus. monoclonals not. want live are. [crying South Carolina] call ""a refusal"" necessarily, one time called jury duty happened eight half months pregnant due date day wanted court. number summons call ""had acceptable reason"" appear. So, called explained situation clerk promptly excused duty nice day. 12 years ago called again. Shhh... he’s listening. sounds like they're incompetent. National Guard Nurses know shit? assume regular jobs like National Guard full time gig right? think people understand mask wont 100% effective... seen minor inconvenience increase chance stopping spread particles. think debate masks settled SARS time around debate quarantines work economic impact closing country foreigners extended periods time...not masks/washing hands efficacy. Current vaccines won’t going anyone 16  *any kind school proactive agents spreading disease. ought plan remove people actively help kill patients healthcare jobs. doubt tell em know jurry nullification is. worry everyone cancelled subscription Fire them. Period. Put end unions. aren’t half likely contract spread Covid half likely present like contracted spread COVID. mean is, likely don’t react strongly (major respiratory, etc) it. I’ve prek teacher decade kids get all, back back like 1st/2nd grade. missed data spread that, within time frame got quietly spreading, data changes kids aren’t schools, looks like get less. Testing kids hell Midwest many many people beginning stayed home, can’t test, quarantine, made looks like less. lastly, data patterns look like country. might wrong, hope I’m wrong. can’t wait read years piece together missing long term data kids pandemic meanings / synonyms 'get around' 'evade', make sense context full quote

""The South Africa variant concerning right appear may obviate medical countermeasures, particularly antibody drugs,"" “transmission scientific journals, doesn’t look sensational MSM sources, numbers abysmal. 333% higher infection rate amongst educators. kids aren’t tested they’re asymptotic, it’s getting spread around somehow, right? I’m sorry bad guy, unless/until tests positive literally reason tell anyone anything. Virus, fragments, pcr detect fragments non viable virus, not? I’ve seen theorized here, seems pretty far fetched me. Bacteria develop strains resistant antibiotics, viruses unlikely able quickly mutate evade would otherwise successful immune response. 

I’m expert viruses though, would accept evidence contradicting still... day... 6th grade English teacher still follows around. Yes, sorry Ms. Fitzpatrick. remember this. here. definitely pop champagne lol say without consent. Plenty people willing this. Also plenty people even bother second dose, data collect anyway we're willing actually study rather sit hands people go unvaccinated. hanging doorways would dangerous Spring Fall.    means health facility health hazard. also commented questioning motive. Mostly second covid vaccine tampering article read. First pharmacist. that's whole career lifestyle throw away. Whatever motive is, sure money. think people need heard explaining actions. probably never make public ears. People right live to.

The constitution biblical text, amended, amended amended etc. Nothing closed people money. Blaming people pointless. egregious violations lockdown aka huge parties never shut down. None restrictions enforced. mean that, general, viruses kill host spread well. dead people rarely go parties, also means others likely careful around disease. efficient virus one negative impact all, encouraging host continue social interactions something like lethargy illness would prevent. 

Of course, mean impossible, strain deadly likely face additional hurdles spread compared less deadly counterpart. Given enough time, evolutionary pressure likely create cold ebola. idea first heard vaccine. worried rushed trials fast possible. However....then read vaccine works since bird flu, years ago. took that, made higher priority, vaccine today.

That really helped alleviate concerns have. getting vaccine soon allowed to. really hope prioritized others though since able work home fine. wholeheartedly believe everyone else, mean everyone else, deserves me. Hes worse. Says ass hair Hahaha brilliant ! thought urging Americans go Malaysia first. 

Covid rampant US, would suggest people come US? fair year seen HUGE increases criminal charges think joking 150m Americans want vaccinated (hence 150 days), there's many anti-vaxxers. already set goal 100 million 100 days something like surely plan behind it. WE'RE FUCKED, WAVE GOING MAKE PEOPLE EAT CHILDREN!!! also doesn’t go much important question: even he’s right gain-of-function experiments dangerous, different question one whether viral samples collected all. doesn’t offer many scientists saying shouldn’t, providing examples lab leaks collections.

I feel like that's authors main reasoning there, low standards lab's personal security attempted cover-up blame specific experiments. Spoken full rapist.  whole first part comment deleted knew wrong. literally showing wrong thats deleted it.

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt get myself. Nice. Love Alex... completely sealed suit self-contained air supply 100% effective. ""oh fine, wear mask""

*gets accident way store. chance witness pronounced dead scene still alive dying*

""oh that's meant said ICU beds full""

this big fear ICU maxed wife still insisted going non-important appointments. think limit 'when need it' Worker unavailability well known factor pandemic. U Minnesota, multiple conferences discussed movement H5N1 threaten society. 

It's passenger movers; truckers bring goods retail stores droves. what, folks? still ""half year"" ballpark vaccinate US people. I'm thankfully exempt jury duty. silver lining mental health issues\~ Ouch, I'm sorry hear that. know started it? survive financially? problem we’re together. took seriously life would lot better overall, sooner.

I’m sorry hear you’re hard time. sounds really tough. federalism American experiment clearly fails Wow several! Several. wonder many is. couple probably less “lot”.

Since theres 50 states, _several_ following cdc guidelines, implies _most_ are! Amazing works. 

Thus, point stands, (as us, since cant move suddenly) get wait non compliant medical staff. Yes states might differently, likely plan. like rich people get cut line, theres exceptions every rule pointing really doesnt discussion meaningful way. Sorry bud.

Not sure point comment was. Good luck, comrade! mentioned doggy style?? Reporting duty sir!! whole safety/efficacy testing start finish, though. IIRC Pfizer said could ~6 weeks need be. sent notice appear, never rescinded really careful issue warrant arrest never tell never come looking you. get pulled something minor officer finds gets you. really ridiculous. Though I'm surprised sent reason like want go rescind notice appear. may sent you, districts great stuff. 

&amp;nbsp;

For anyone else, hundreds ways get jury duty really want to. financially able health allows, get with. 

*btw interesting fact, live rural area make DA offices existence hell forcing jobs, often really want jury duty future cases. You’re bad guy, you’re idiot. It’s like switch turns you’re positive. It’s like you’re positive get test you’re positive get results. Exactly. nah, like ICE concentration camps Nevertheless, cut Alaska half, new half-Alaskas would still bigger Texas :p beat population size category, course. BC flu deaths? U.S. appears far more, per capita. ignorance stop??? Ever? Taiwan tracks phone location credit card purchases also enforces quarantine way. seems bit totalitarian side me. america adopts process, well.. remember finally got rid TSA plane hijacking threats went away? takes weeks body build immunities shots. weeks vaccination, good. want make sure others die, I'd probably wear mask yet vaccinated know should, ppl vaccinated, anti-maskers anti-vaxers think okay use lie wear masks. health care workers overwhelmed, administer vaccines now? ignorance denialism transcends stereotypes age gaps. age groups good not. 

I'm 25 get much narcolepsy live rural area tend restrict driving late night social activities heavily. I'm sure hell going risk getting Covid make disorder worse pass parents support impacted ability work live independently. 

It sucks. year since I've hug friend, seen movie, smoked hookah bar, many life's little pleasures. kind prisoner's dilemma everybody restricting way maybe things bad. Totally understand frustration seeing people acting big joke. gotcha point. complete utter societal breakdown drags end year. We're already seeing signs breakdown: people ""given up"" precautions. Psychologists sociologists long known ""social end"" pandemic would come long medical end. guess _institutions_ (bars, events, concerts, retail, etc), support jaded public, openly give finger local govs en masse dare enforce rules. state govs gonna do? dare use national guard especially lockdowns supremely unpopular. 

Of course, come screeching halt new mutation arises kills children young adults 10% rate, _fear_ motivate people complying again. surprising. got sick VA would test using satellite locations testing. Thing locations shut refused work VA pay bills get tested pocket. VA's number one priority always delay treatment hope vet dies expend money. Frustrated? Gov failed run full vax distribution process. killed thousands prospectively.

Worse, passive statement typically French. Where's triple team competition cooperation best plan? think beach front cafe waiting better weather. shame. Frustrated!! gaul. Also $3500 fine breaking quarantine, followed jail 2nd offense. They'd ones indoors without mask, Yes? 6ft scam.. fluid simulation show droplets travels way 6... Yet many people thought 6 ft safe without mask... Thanks CDC playing since day 1 keeps playing down. ask. Jeez. Bunny answer. Bunny america, means xan sue state millions right..? Yeah, read preprint day. really messed one up. **Coronavirus daily case rate race ethnicity:**

Latino: 1,696 coronavirus cases per 100,000 Latino residents

White: 636 coronavirus cases per 100,000 white residents 
Asian American: 519 coronavirus cases per 100,000 Asian American residents 


Why rate high among Latinos low AAs? warning world years drug resistant bacteria, world seems care yet  estimate least 1% people reading headline know ""UIrelief"" means unemployment money. Sanitization useless theater. virus spreads air, contact surfaces. courthouses old terrible air circulation. Plus jails often COVID hotspots, also problem. No, COVID evolve point vaccines ineffective would make dramatic changes spike protein would probably make bind less efficiently lung receptor. get black people Tuskagee Henrietta Lacks reasons skepticism, highly agree valid.

But it’s applicable scenario races getting vaccinated time science transparent, solidly backed well-published. It’s really frustrating honestly irksome see people, especially healthcare backgrounds, turn vaccine emotional reasons. High lethality inherently tends burn favorite position well. Sleeping streets better dying. tested positive dec 1st &amp; quarentined &amp; December 15th tested negative. brother positive, get now? ""carry it"" without showing symptoms time, pass others? 

( plan quarentining another 10-14 days.) Damn. never saw coming. Especially Florida. *votes self instead* dude, everytime think recovery nearing 100% even 90%, i'm knocked back ass. covid anniversary month way comment makes sense don’t value lives others. Trump zero say Illinois school district operate. blame national handing. particular policy local level. B117 finishing blow, _set up_: seeding tens millions additional cases, many opportunities virus mutate becomes inevitable mutation shape spike protein occurs vaccines rendered moot. think we'll end permanent state chasing tail since we've lost state capacity. can't tweak vaccines fast enough keep up, let alone distribute. concern misplaced though. worrying family send kids school, go work? backwards, bc schools open almost cases workplaces riddled cases. yet go work. paid stay home would little damage us assure huge harm done kids home.

Stop trying gotcha. Please also dont insult intelligence lack expertise. let greed voice. Government services privatized, vulture capitalists care immediate short-term profits. witnessing result 40 years privatization. Let's put way: HIGHLY doubtful thatpatient zero originate China, even proves case originate China, fact Chinese government \*actively\* suppressed information COVID citizens rest world, time denial many Wuhan's 12 million citizens quarantined - instead traveling freely (and naively) within without China led propagation virus worldwide pandemic. fact.

Until find patient zero, never find patient zero, CCP continue deny responsibility COVID pandemic time claim virus originated somewhere else. also fact. It’s like they’re going pay quarantined exposed jury duty either. Probably means masks hospitals 800k 8% people UAE total, citizens. speaking rats, rodents reservoir one sars-cov-2 mutations. guess whats never going away :( way comment makes sense disregard costs keeping schools closed. American wannabes. last checked india one world largest medical supply production though. loop: LA bad given CA restrictive lockdowns? *very* good fact gets repeated often, good reason. here's little bit nuance: virus lethal *still transmissible* long enough incubation time.

It's like setting cluster bomb inside body. Sure, detonate once, host body dies get spread. lay low week two, spread around armies yourself, *then* detonate bombs...why, detonate hard like, still succeed *transmission* part. Many schools kids stay classroom teachers move around period period. I'm pretty sure wildlife corals getting much needed rest fat Americans obnoxious Chinese. last check Ko Phi Phi blocked that. course. school held person teachers put pretty high vaccination priority. point able vaccinate teachers dramatical change calculus benefit person schooling vs increased risk spread within community causes.   15 low end. uncommon patients advanced lung disease need 60 liters/min more. walk around hospital high flow, 6 separate tanks. Yeah, we're gonna fucking get we? think CA rough now, R _1.18_. B.1.1.7 months, goes **1.3**. 

I extremely locked save bus ride outdoor gym times week. guarantee I'll pick b117 community get vaccine. Yes, CEO time valuable can't waste it. court system compel show up, time free them, gets wasted. Newsom.

Lockdowns thee none mee

Also london breed god forbid praising china reddit, people start marching pitchfork hands tie torch dogs marched together. Sadly, might drag poor unsuspecting soul them. Cover. Your. F’ing. Nose. guy picture... cause spread. Uneducated people... Well fair, Florida insane lol. live Oregon ha one talking locked decades. I’d playing Russian Roulette long infected signed away right ICU bed.

Personal choice wonderful thing long it’s truly personal affects one else. According doc main risk covid cytokine storm. would assume lung capacity reasonably normal, risk changed substantially. 

Get o2 monitor though, learn use it, normal various situations. close success story.

then election sabah happened.

fuck side ways right ? people willing go way pay donate money cut line get vaccine also likely skirt mandates restrictions already place protect people could expose others virus skirting restrictions exposes them. 

It sucks cut, person vaccinated 1/330,000,000 way closer end this. Literally older bible. **other** 3rd world countries

I like even mean I'm surprised Buncombe county there. I'd love know could get mine essential worker. vax got distributed already?  feds 2 weeks better plan. know current Admin paradad around, need vax, we'll get parade.

As 2, valid point. wonder consider environments. we've opened gyms, restaurants bars (in areas), big box stores, etc... schools areas. solution make schools higher priority. first thing close non-essential areas. Schools last list. We're basically living bad sci-fi movie plot. Hong Kong China controlled border crossing. seen rogue restaurants opening over, defying restrictions? seen one. rebels? everyone bragging stats easy live island u isolate world... like Great Britain isolated island xD Yeah reddit much better /s Meanwhile top health official skeptical masks lockdowns still calls shots. Fuck conspiracy theory bullshit False. defending China CCP, pointing rebuttal weak. read ""oh, guy OBVIOUSLY pro-China.""

And I'm tell wrong. I'm not. insist am, truth is, I'm simply pro-China. I'm pointing flaw weak rebuttal. Get better one. know I’m scientist, Doctor, going give appearance idiot - - I’m steroid user. years. pin shoulder, using basically needles. sanitize, draw (I’m pulling fluid much, much thicker), sanitize again, pin everything put away 3 minutes. 

I know there’s much bureaucracy paperwork hospital setting, they’re definitely going speed could even without sense emergency. 50% saw Pfizer (their briefing document FDA). remember Moderna said.  vaccine escaped BSL-4 laboratory


Nice sarcasm, think mean virus, vaccine. Oh absolutely understand. sarcastic first line Yeah thanks info several countries already overrun it. abbatoir workers greater risk. virus lives longer cold freezing conditions. Something keep mind. 100% mortality conservative estimate??? fuck cares Moderna makes billion dollars profit? literally saving millions lives trillions dollars. problem right vaccinating serious amount people. course would better vaccinate optimal people option vaccinate 1000 perfect people 20000 imperfect people, take 20000 time. Perfect enemy progress sit wait perfect groups people come thousands dying.

It wide open either, right max restrictions wasted. Makes sense, since virus cannot travel undocumented workers agricultural industry good, god-fearing Americans.

/s I'd say 60% Facebook friends anti-vaccine feed loaded whole bunch articles awful vaccine everything happen get it. try talk little bit use. understand concerns least research articles posting. 

On side note...one friends got vaccine developed Bels Palsy two days later. I'm still convinced caused vaccine freak little bit admit. No, outsource countries shitty one party communist state manipulating markets violating trade agreements. Why? want get sick die I’ll give someone else might die? stupid isn’t illegal. 

What good reporting going do? Meanwhile Oxford/AstraZeneca blocked several months least. Coincidence? informative. like teachers, good folks. 2021 great start... would take vaccine made China? 28th December highest daily deaths since April, 600: Hawaii 1/5 population New Zealand, yet ten times deaths. Oh yes, probably evil aliens invented covid spite us. Instead age, need people living certain population density. Probably protection, ones playing around need get way someone else. highly irresponsible, given hospitals becoming overwhelmed, refusal likely add problem too. people realize this. UK strain starting work magic well? hate say this, NYC messaging getting tested borderline insane. message basically, ""Get tested... keep getting tested... everyday... matter what."" 

The lines batshit crazy they're everywhere I'm like, ""is best way prevent spread? Putting strangers differing long lines people day day instead staying home can, masking up, distancing, waiting find exposed someone feel ill?"" 

Also, NYC lowest rate vaccine administration UNITED STATES. think Oklahoma bottom state 28.5% New York City 27% so. Add YouTube comments section list. can't watch Covid related video without load anti-vaxxers spreading conspiracy theories. cares? It’s stupid reward. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* respect that. taken calves 3 months stairs calves shots. think thats spell calves? Calfs? Muscles? know mean. ✔ tell people also believe Santa Claus might believe this. don’t know Reddit seems think “Just let stupid people get sick” viable public health strategy, don’t see Fauci signing onto anytime soon.

The higher percentage people get vaccine safer, think policies made goal mind. death numbers past ten years pretty revealing Slowing spread virus important. think people would let virus spread freely meant preventing society collapsing. thought id seen levels pandemic nope people keep surprising ok wot averages 25k chump change lot rich people, someone could die skip queue. could invent calculus! That's fair actually. death rate among general population exceedingly low. Based media reports immunity lasts anywhere 2 weeks forever. mean downvoted me? agreed said lol People dying Covid mid-flight. cruise industry wants continue right without herd immunity. Companies wont turn dollars infected. risk death extremely low. Saying ""it's extremely high"" leaves lot room there. resign position St. Joseph’s too. That's think happened
 
A city like LA still far reaching point. go route, worst days still come seems missed said; instance without test every reason believe got another sickness covid. they're looking awful. Seriously, post negative stuff sub. access internet means access information rest us. make choice get vaccinated, feel bad them, gets mine much sooner. No. mill chump change 2K number? 5K, 10K? read headline, read article. transmissible means:

1. people get sick.
2. people get hospitalized.
3. people die non-COVID causes due hospitals overwhelmed.
4. finally, people die COVID.

Yes, able deploy vaccine half population tomorrow, would fine. Unfortunately, that's timeline we're on. right want perfectly healthy rich person able skip queue potentially condemn someone actually needs vaccine chump change? So, groups received vaccines ""magically"" less contact COVID placebo groups? supposed last... know, forever? point getting fucking vaccine?

Isn't whole reason we're scared coronavirus specifically deadly single strain flu? Science...constantly discovering obvious. shit can't explained science. Without substantial vaccine rollout, warned, “cases, hospitalizations, I.C.U. admissions deaths 2021 may exceed 2020.”

I assume they're talking UK, wow. ??????

You covid positive test, still virus (obviously).

To get positive test covid-19 post-exposure (obviously).

But virus negative test result (not enough time since exposure). 

So said true. can’t elective surgeries keep afloat financially. Instead hospitals inundated Unprofitable Covid patients. Many hospitals close rural areas. downside profit medical industry, saving population help bottom line, problem. proves done quickly assuming resources etc get estimate infection numbers based seroprevalence data, what's methodology used determine deaths underreported 43%. say there's ""multiplying factors"" without going much detail. True far news reporting, new strain contagious lethal. however, contagious also leads deaths transmissible issue. long vaccine defeats virus fine. I'm Canada, idea talking 'rationing' healthcare. need statement ready time-wasters sign, puts end line. heartbreaking news. movie industry already getting fucked is. also get 2k stimulus? Thanks. People want things disease dumb risk almost noon existent. part stop spreading hysteria... Also used voice text phone proof read text, blow me.

Just Google search results doctors opinions... silenced narrative FOX CNN. said work medical manufacturers hospitals across nation get ""of record"" conversations everyday. thanks pairs like cancel culture they're afraid speak Rush losing livelyhood fucking scared.

If want disease... stay home. rest us live lives There’s good thread provides baseline “athletes heart damage covid” thing resurrected September reason. Plus clubs would money spectators go back forever, music industry would cease exist, doeses ready instantly would another Moderna situation? 67 veto override, no?

Two thirds constitution says. thought analysis far.

It's worth noting actual daily deaths figures 600 present - headline figure backlog reporting effect new year + weekend. OMG, anxiety feel far do. Peace love guys. Nothing do. I’m using Well, great effect economies isnt? Thats need tbh.

Biological warfare isnt legal anyway (geneva c.) would get country nuked time, either something like better dont all.

That said, doubt created used weapon. would China ban wet markets? vaccine escaped BSL-4 laboratory Wuhan, wet market. kinda did, unless manufactured Wuhan bio weapons lab. really feasible options covid’s origin story. Imagine World Cup fans.... Yeah, that's lame af. Also young population lowest obesity rate world (2.1%, exact). Could something low death rate? Nah, be. suspicious China publicly saying virus originate China.

Not really suspicious anyone follows China closely. even quite that, antibodies blood every infection ever times. going keep antibodies circulation [a following infection, antibody levels fall undetectable levels (but B-cells produce presence new covid infection). 

Maybe antibody test involved triggering B-cells produce antibodies (possibly presence vaccine), could work, I'm speculating. fuck's sake, Texas. hahaha you’ve following lead whole time, dill pickle. new material, weirdo? took L, wouldn’t life long conversation dweebiness Stop letting sociologists ethics committees decide lives dies make first-come-first-serve. 

We'd easily close 50 million vaccinated anyone could get them. enough herd immunity probably enough decrease infections definitely enough least flatline them. Also, less rich people spreading covid people work them. Thank Gaven Newsom this. dumbass broke COVID restrictions, mishandled fires, hurt small businesses. poured kerosene conspiracy fire encouraged people want comply COVID restrictions look happened. Trump lost get it. makes angry. feel angry heartbroken whole pandemic showing signs slowing. :( Fuck got mine. thinking I'd way offended constantly reading stories vaccines languishing storage. possible that, part, reason state bottom 5 cases schools closed... open summer closed winter months would great idea tho. im getting - like communicable disease mental illness. really can't come anything you. Holy shit 🤣. got lot new material now, welcome Awesome LOL’ing devastation lockdown causes others doubt privileged millennial sitting work home job helpful. hate break affected, give time. case anyone wondering...its summer South Africa South African strain well. long people vote standard corporate shills way. Vote progressive candidates take special interest money may see change. pretty good data [Socialstyrelsens review causes deaths january-june covid-19 deaths spike, deaths cancer circulatory diseases down, meaning one diagnose replaces another cases. time hardly blame people, governments local federal level want give people crumbs, can't expect anyone willingly stay lock without appropriate aid.

It spread among friends choice work. National guard Walgreens cvs become plot Stephen King's ""The Stand""? sorry loss 🙏 No, train disease outbreaks humanitarian crises general.

The thing plan commander chief deciding eliminate civilian pandemic plan ignore downplay remaining experts. startling headline Department Duh. give father law intramuscular testosterone- stuff thick cold honey. learned give IM injections. learned quick YouTube video old nurse's manual. 

It's truly pretty damn easy. wonder keep empty wing hospitals rich people like Dr Dre? friend's dad cancer last year, chemo whole nine yards still today going eat dinner public.  We've got clunky thing works really well isolating people called video, literally everybody different room listening evidence, reading files, etc.

Unless need smell somebody works great court, protects everyone. Holy shit everywhere stupid fucking opinions. realize bottom 5? shut earlier harder states. fucking stupid possibly be? ""Uh, duh, there's covid here, shut down??"" fucking imbecile. want pedantic, suppose equipment failure possibility. 99.999%. agree China playing good guy free fault. dispute pretty uncool countries banning entry. However, saying China covered pandemic hid information late stop true. Jesus. used practice county recognize judge. Republican worked many years ago. wonder denier. cannot recognize defense lawyer back head. shitshow Texas is. Things way control summer. spring lockdown helped fall came early October number infections rose quickly. 

Most likely fact people gather outside boosted virus, seems seasonal component. 

The real question long immunity lasts. lot people bother getting vaccine every year they'll glad take every 5-10 years. *your major part difference is, industrial use care motor oil compressor gets aerosolized gas. medical purposes, care that.  psych wards Chicago FULL.

Source (not doubt rather find stat fascinating) ""But officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo New York, said poor execution hospitals largely blame slow start. Mr. Cuomo, one, resisting calls start offering shots lower-priority groups yet.""

This guy forced nursing homes take [COVID patients, blamed residents started dying en masse.

He really needs start accepting responsibility work improve response state level. would happen proven China purposefully manufactured COVID? sad thing someone probably originated meme ironic in-joke. know little electronics *does* look like kind analog amplifier signal processing. kind f tracker, haha, laugh people know better.

Stop. Think. meming responsibly? guy bigger threat Brazil Trump United States? passed quest going left right Great! 5G? makes envy guy shows says asked impartial judge, automatically trust cops says automatically think cops liars get jury duty. Everyone knows rhet could stop they're business selling tickets turning away paying customers (even they're scalpers) best interest. need guard lol. criteria age, 70+ right now, 60+ starting next Wednesday, 50+ week later, forth. Send city hall pharmacy whatever every town, divided % relative population. matter residency etc. criteria simple age verification. Hell, buy sudafed beer...

Or even better, determine minimum age exhaust supply have, that's minimum age now. Give couple weeks old folks get fair opportunity, fcfs.

I'm pretty sure simply limiting 60+ would cut death rate half, probably enough that.

I got pretty good odds. I'll gladly wait every single 65+ whatever gotten it, older folks good odds all. 100% board flat age criteria. problem generation. distortion lines literally freezing.  Brewery open letting yeast thing bottling results: makes sense

Open bar sales room serve customers: makes much less sense  agree unlikely hit million US smash 400,000 deaths well end January. essentially inevitable point, deaths lag cases 3 weeks. Current 7 average deaths 2,700 daily cases decreasing. 500,000 end February within reals possibility. Actually double need two doses Apple recently switched MEMS resonators - tiny electromechanical timepieces - lot products they're little thinner quartz components.

This resulted unexpected problem. turns helium vented medical science equipment likes get stuck inside casing, throws mechanical properties *just enough* disable iPhones.

So important keep vigilant unexpected consequences.

Nobody's much self-assembly machines *that's* something exceedingly careful about.

Actually that's might good thing mRNA vaccines need cold storage. need cold storage nanoparticles last long room body temperature. Netanyahu called lockdown. Israel's senate (knesset) chose immediately be. Relatively hard. get walk around devices size r2d2 low level generation mass bigger deal. Time governors mandate masks outdoors, maybe? try something point. Hmm I’m guessing lab-leak “conspiracy”? What? Bars closed since March, now, outdoor dining even allowed. right tell people lose homes even stay home go outside job pays bills. Preach us homeless. Yep. Helicopters, sirens nonstop LA neighborhood too. problem vaccinating teachers still bring virus home partner, isn’t teacher part group prioritized get vaccine. children, would also risk. 

My school already told us plan rest academic year get guidance summer. Teachers front-line workers, martyrs, child care providers sake parent’s convenience. Put resources making distance learning equitable, stop paying expensive programs Khan Academy others refined process years, wear damn masks. Nurses aren’t immunologists. dumb you? Easy move goalposts, ""It's California, full Dems, fuck 'em, get shutting country."" See easy. /s 6k 24k employees healthcare system taken vaccine. work covid unit coworkers refused it. ones 50 taken part.

Goes show frontline workers really think covid. Seattle mills south downtown. we're asking god things anyway, ask *him* save us? Lots people Taiwan distrust government. criticism mostly government even careful. government allowing exceptions people quarantine 14 days entering country.



Anti-maskers political reasons. They're selfish assholes inconvenienced dare get loud it. jurors, judge, lawyers, bailiff, witnesses, etc, actually get covid trial?

The dumb thing didn’t delay trial 14 days positive test, guess didn’t active infection since one got sick. visited HK 1/19 last year friend already asking “why traveling now? buy masks?” Oblivious me: need mask? don’t wear mask shouldn’t allowed treatment hospital. Plain simple. Fucking idiots. article published yesterday data atleast 2 months old. know situation worse ever before, argument needs supported data recent. Joke's them...they're named...now they're chipped. #5GLife Local hospitals vaccinating entire staffs including hundreds administrators folk work non-essential parts business, even entirely separate buildings/blocks COVID. hospital's need make $$$ running elective procedures midst trump grocery store worker. hospital staff fact dealing COVID things - many important, many safely done site. That’s evolution works. First need mutation - someone happened enough reproductions - selection pressure come effect.  downvoted guesses gambles

Could refer literally anything. specific want something answered current stance something like - perhaps, seldom, special situations, virus might possibly suspended air, rare. Instead, totally 1M people day sneezing coughing other's faces. People love complain FIVE. There’s V word. Many people Maryland like him. IDK currently, precovid, approval ratings 70s parties, rare place. tune changed **we vaccines now** **going mass vaccinate teachers first 100 days**... AVM brain bleed cerebellum 10 years ago, AVM glued shut brain surgery clip aneurysms. brain problem fixed, I'm wondering would happen got this? Would worse not?!!? I've recovered stuff already, want go again. 

My coworkers seem blasé whole thing feel like bad guy I'm happy finally go back in-person work. Sigh. live India? would know hospitals nowhere near overrun, even though life largely back normal. cares numbers long healthcare system still functioning, there's need triage like we're seeing US. need freezers anyways store bodies *facepalm* agree math, problem 91MM know they've covid. agree case people diagnosed recovered covid probably high list. asymptotic cases, can't knock unless reliable antibody testing method. We’ve already tried Operation Derp Speed. Time new plan attack. downvoted vaccination teachers part plan, decided leave comment. stupid? sound dumb hell right now. Arguing labor laws barbaric. ashamed yourself. Elderly 65+ patient facing medical workers nursing home staff only

I've downvoted stance since basically 2/3 country essential category high priority all.  antibody test? Texas, really doesn’t surprise me. compulsion needed. China knows everyone is. comply, find arrest you. mind asking, Chiayi? Operation Derp Speed maybe issue way complex nuanced simplified solutions? Tiers efficacy ass, assumed Sweden bad reading (fake) news instead looking stats themselves, proud admit it. look honestly numbers politics applied see find countries did/did lock fared well/not well. 

People like yell loudly, seek numbers regurgitate fake news claim know everything help slightest. So...what Republicans saying along. yeah that's true, wish move 65+ though Keep dreaming, there's way going eradicated. Look new coronaviruses it, stick around good. wrong society feel need defend companies matter anti-life decisions make. need stop focusing money exception, global pandemic. Also bit premature congratulate them, let;s wait see well work first. reach minimal levels spread illness sure executive meetings Hawaii definitely worth bonuses. asinine people upvoting this. company actually helping end pandemic stoop level. Shows little people actually read upvote based title alone.. Hospital capacity stretch medical professionals protected getting sick. unlikely CDC chief right. CDC assumed large number truly asymptomatic individuals. data came along, projections appear off. initially thought 70% people asymptomatic. got revised 40% September. Latest data shows around 17-20%. sure spare doctors literally half subs posts “we don’t enough doctors” irrelevant.

Luckily you’re allowed whatever dumb baseless opinions want. aren’t charge jack shit doesn’t matter Incredibly well said fucking mind blowing economists/capitalists/politicians yet figured key economic success lies STRONG environmental social stewardship. people live fire/underwater, nobody afford go pandemic + jobless... business fail. economy fail. political career fail.

These sociopathic zombies realize LITERALLY get RICHER bothered make sure earth population thrive, everyone happy be.

I mean literally dutch living example this. Dutch East India Company 19th Century + Huge Oil profits 20th century meant lot profit short term Netherlands periods. Dutch do? country re-invested lot back country part kind savings fund benefits all, many individually wealthy dutch re-invested back families generations. Compound level economic decision making 100 years they're one stable, wealthy countries earth.

I really hope going inspires really angry economist write new economic manifesto countries/businesses listen to, actually cares stewardship. like happened 19th century industrial revolution happened happened 1930's first big stock market crash. angry economists times paved way better future handle business &amp; economics whole. everyone enjoyed better quality life it. whole world cared much stewardship New Zealand does, we'd beaten thing last July. also people saying would disappear easter last year. We've got people sides spectrum everywhere. strange people like starting react negatively bad news negative opinions criticisms government's handling virus. That’s personal decision. It’s like seasons totally backwards dude whoaaaa freedom earned sacrifices thanks fantastic fellow citizens public service workers, never forget it.

And competent Government. 

Many sacrifices made UK, scientists developed excellent vaccine record time, NHS working extremely hard. Sadly, cannot overcome incompetence lamentable Government, whose policy responses pandemic always little, late. need eradicate it. eventually mutate way vaccine longer effective we're right back start. approved Europe already? okay people try better ya know? even arent perfect? wish companies would once, exception, focus human kind billions. Yes, need make profit, need MUCH people dying hate say aren’t wrong. I’ve supported lot really let done late. RemindMe! 6 months places everyone wearing masks huge covid outbreaks instances can’t work Nope, flu immunity lasts lifetime, known current viruses immunity lasts six 24 months.

There's thing like generic respiratory virus they're like magically thus immune response different every different virus though always notice end results kind either stay sick probably die get better.

The way understand immune response look specific virus animal's immune system case obviously humans.

You can't cheat generalize though look family viruses closest genetic relative.

In case look closest generic relative wind seeing immunity based antibody response lasts 6 24 months 24-month Congress rare.

So anybody says there's going truly long-lasting immunity 10 plus years probably talking ass regardless use antidotal science back can't say unless years passed really prove it. Yes, hold breath 10, 15, 30 mins....

Just put mask keep distance. locked time everyone else March, hardly cases begin due remoteness. Los Angeles, famous Republican stronghold don’t get schools going back hybrid model cases hospitalization time, addition new variant that’s likely widespread. NZ terminate flights either. Tens thousands people arrived NZ lockdown continue arrive now. many arrivals March impossible put quarantine national lockdown used make whole country quarantine facility. arrivals dropped April lockdown eased new arrivals sent state quarantine facilities. politics. Gotta something report. hair chinny chin chin No. British studies shown likely kill standard variant, may even slightly *less* likely put hospital.

But infects people, deaths go up. Hell, could even less lethal deaths would *still* go infectiousness goes enough. fuck, death rates go want move grandparents Korea next year I’m sure dangerous flying days (from Toronto, Canada).

How risky would meet elderly people international flight? always trust guy say something important already obvious. Americans behaving way first wave slowing down.. 'may' :( difference nearly everyone masked BLM, literally one 

Also, guys leave rally today PACK bars hotel rooms, getting drunk, masks, breathing spitting other. real danger lies virus really takes off.  Friday highest numbers, expect around 30k then. Also many cases haven’t reported yet seems like vaccines less ""eradicate herd immunity"" like Measles ""protects immunized person severe disease"" like flu shot.

Either way going happen, everyone going get vaccine. country smaller big metro cities hard government control mean Dr. Knows-what-the-fuck-he's-talking-about? 


How many degrees medical field again? talking cousin? cells necessarily provide long term immunity, least protective immunity. cells activated, reinfection must occur level act infected cells. Also, detectable memory cell responses tend rather short lived virus. United States large-scale, nationwide system checking coronavirus genomes new mutations, including ones carried new variant. 1.4 million people test positive virus week, researchers genome sequencing — method definitively spot new variant — fewer 3,000 weekly samples. work done patchwork academic, state commercial laboratories. Technically lot two islands, go mate blind.. doesn’t care 😞 evidence New Zealand’s position right results policy change social behavior. could well due seasonality natural dynamics. 
Other countries hemispheres took similar approaches New Zealand. Results varied. Many countries comparatively little ended place NZ now, well. 
NZ’s policies dissimilar lots western countries, big PR campaign going politician, boast more.  That's got vilified. scamming insurance industry, poor. scamming poor he'd like ever pharma CEO. whole family? What. months country? confirmed positive times? immune system complex i
youd think least blunt effects second time Yes cause majority health care workers people 65 work. 99.8% reduction flu “random chance”? Since flu also spreads internationally less flu countries well COVID reduction measures also reduce flu countries aren’t. One person start outbreak. person wears mask washes hands instead eliminate thousands future cases. goes show misinformation targeted at. mean would reasonable citizen another western country care much american politics fellow countrymen become enemy? Unlikely there's reason believe that. 

When say immunity, probably mean type immune response sells better call immunity sounds like immune. Yeah, I’d interested exact method used determining much death underreported. isn’t reasonable think surveillance system accurate enough catch deaths, however point estimations I’ve seen put range undercount around 10-25%. study jacks 35% Nov 19.  There's part wishes Trump engaged inner dictator fantasies responded Covid martial law lockdown, reason see Left turning lockdowns reflexive opposition anything Trump wants. free U.S. citizens. Someone still paying it, though.  know many 21 cases history allergic reactions? Surely that’s important detail think people India reacting differently US.....These gatherings highest rate transmission - close proximity, inside, close friends/family sharing/touching many items/utensils, masks ALL, eating drinking around people yelling talking thus spreading droplets everyone eating drinking.... sudden spread due american culture action, necessarily new mutation. high increase cases surely though Carbon Monoxide flammable, regularly tested industrial supply Oxygen. mean... that's we've already doing, millions cases/mutation opportunities show it. not, back log New Years holiday, thats 

same exact thing happened immediately Xmas, drop deaths 26th - 28th huge spike couple days back ""normal"" ~ 2,500/day 

the highest 7 day moving average 2,700/day, number actually moves past 3,000 week really get ready hit F 1 week 2nd Pfizer dose, 2 weeks 2nd Moderna dose Yes, know. stupid think totalitarian government would better.

they better, that's thing

I'm disagreeing heart statement, submit totalitarian government either... totalitarian government allowed lot countries really get handle Covid. 

Look New Zealand. went full authoritarian/totalitarian months they're less OK now.

The U.S. Government free HIGHLY fractured (basically 50/50 split opinions) everything could make worse every step way.

I'm making argument losing rights free citizen though. I'm pointing facts. think US since least October. Possibly sooner.

My state's numbers nearly 10 fold around time. Pessimism fact enjoy sitting reddit, playing video games ordering funko pops amazon day. one talk person insane average redditor commenter snitching neighbors friend over.   founded, built country. 

Are one types think slavery existed? even better, greatfull? EU/US probably start thinking legislation would allow border closures countries/states

You'd tear entire USA start order make possibility. many places state borders largely indistinguishable. get mad businesses helping PPE machines. 

If factory makes air conditioners fans, I'm going start making ventilators might even get money resources. I'm going continue make money stay business.

If decide huge losses possible would go add employees unemployment line.

If government gave money necessary convert machines making ventilators could that. would also contract buy said ventilators. 

This entire point War Powers Act 1941. Hundreds businesses given money government make supplies WW2.  OWS huge success. Sure, bumps along way, funded 95% effective vaccine US vaccinated people country. Aldo Raines asks ""would take bet?"" become citizen bad ass country? Asking friend. immunity lasts 1-8 months, please point millions confirmed reinfections seeing right 87 million confirmed cases worldwide.

You millions reinfections. around 100,000 reinfections globally, far calculate true number reinfections. reason people even first infectious exposure event. first second exposure event would even rarer. Second off, certain percent people fail seroconvert generate antibodies virus. calculate around 7% average numerous serological studies recovered patients. So, going certain percent recovered patients reinfected would also need second infectious exposure event. that's line see data collected hospital surveys potentially reinfected individuals. 

As confirmation, virtually impossible vast majority patients reinfected due stored first sample. Additionally, also can't determine person reinfected homologous reinfection happens (like coronaviruses) samples would same. guarantee it. dont know things live, im one takes virus serious! mask due stores making people business usual. “Im states, southern”. big thing “im getting vaccine” ive heard everything “there’s chip it” going sterilize everyone ect! lost faith community nation matter. apathetic ignorant. concerned damn election trump prove theres fraud, unbelievable. yeah new variant likely spreading like wildfire, wouldn’t it? like actually anything country stop it. yes does, give vaccine everyone older 65, reopen economy death rates hospitalizations severely low considering age 65 getting effected. Reinfection still rare, unless gene sequenced, odds didn’t get reinfected.. also still show positive PCR tests months, even symptomless Media enemy. deaths related Christmas. Someone dying would caught virus early-mid December. Haha good one, Americans never stop talking NHS struggling get staff. simple virology. virus wants spread. ""goal,"" speak. virus kills host, i.e. deadly, spreads less, eventually end viral spread. Therefore virus mutations end contagious win out, contagious viruses tend less deadly. majority people getting vaccinated 65 far USA? think focus teachers two fold...first they're organized capable advocating way retail service industry workers not. Second, spend extended periods students (increasing likelyhood spreading infection) retail worker usually close proximity customer couple minutes. 

Also kids bad wearing masks, though could argued adults great either...and lot older teachers high risk groups. near someone holding breath make difference ? I've irrationally optimistic way long remember something like that. Enjoy gloom doom, hope make last long seem want to. Ok, DC used less half shots given supply currently issue. I've waiting since beginning year fly California visit girlfriend. point go ahead it? Getting tired waiting around. infected people close contacts moved state run quarantine facilities.

This would total non-starter USA. Nobody trusts government enough part right. Hawaii? third population isolated New Zealand. Yet, Hawaii 10x amount cases deaths. “Seasons make difference” blatantly false getting wish vaccines would given first. Instead people got vaccine 65. make death rates less 50 day USA old people get vaccinated. give fuck ""oh they're old"", give fuck getting vaccined first. profits going scientists engineers developed vaccine, shareholders nothing? Google author, get back me. Forgive trusting reporting coming Modiji's government.  stopped publishing daily numbers completely middle last year. 

Why pro China, may ask?

Look daily new cases China. said “fuck it” stopped publishing anything.  u/Liightman read article. American injustice system work. facts bullshit. please, keep licking windows! Exolution prefers genes pass along. act irony, censored. much free media. think point hero-worship veterans, categorize deaths important.

Of course point. point subset people US anti-mask, anti-lockdown, pro-“covid conspiracy”...

What give China credit intense lockdown realized public relations propaganda machine would unable contain serious growing pandemic. Proof people Wuhan knew Chinese government admitted made clear hundreds people - shown video able get Chinese-controlled Internet - shaking fists President Xi toured city massive deaths assure everyone ""everything OK'. day, China allowed outside authority audit many people died Wuhan, elsewhere, China COVID-19.

Admittedly, West (or parts it) derelict management COVID. many ignorant people - including among govern - West. fact. said, ALSO fact China locked Wuhan down, many, many 12million people traveled Europe's great capitals vacation business; also traveled within China near holiday. 

One large question remains. many Chinese citizens either died contracted COVID. Staying claim virus circulating months China finally admitted real, virtually deaths contracted cases reported outside Wuhan. epidemiologists repute find strange claim, way verify truth claim China let outside auditors.

Your anecdotal experience reflect norm. Sorry. asinine purported sentence above. really feel way? think minority think COVID isn’t real? Right, see see right europe easy mRNA vaccines rolled out... 

It's opposite smooth easy. Damn political talk day. 33 San Diego today. would even lower dipshits like can’t good things. literally capitalism works. Think better question knew going happen, didn’t prepare? study done earlier year basically studied half life virus various UV conditions, tried mimick various seasons. Winter simulated sunlight longest half life, summer shortest.  yet OP wants blame traditionally conservative areas. given insulin, told go watch online video inject properly.

Mind vaccine gets injected deeper muscle, still rocket surgery. last thing country needs brain damage. behavior looks like someone want POTUS. maybe ""Above law"" bullshit keeping banging drum. know Obama Hillary literally ran promise ending war terror right? Jumanji 2020. Hunger Games 2021. May odds ever favor. {{{waving District 13 aka FL}}} Might climate. People get exercise winter months. Americans lazier? guess.  part rich people get vaccine? means take year everyone vaccinated US. worrying someone works health care believes conspiracies like do. mean, despite evidence, despite statistical facts figures easily obtainable CDC, UK government, EU et al, still think COVID indiscriminate kills healthy young people easily sick 87 year olds. Sad Mostly government shit slow spread, tradition, people working forced punish breaking lock quarantine. Christmas spike almost entirely going two groups clashing. know you, think ever relationship people. they're selfish capable lying live life want live. I'm RN I'm stay home mom now. see see I'm angry. can't imagine shoes. mRNA vaccines really complex produce. Essentially nobody around world manufacturing capabilities ready. Completely new facilities would build would take many months years completed.

While vector based vaccines manufactured many places around world decades. That's Astrazeneca partner many around world mass produce. Also vector vaccines much much easier handel require extrem cooling chain 10x cheaper per dose.

These two main reasons people around world receive vector based vaccine. Yup, that’s said words person somewhere else. thought Fry's closed! :'( need open stadium fairground parking lots drive thru get vaccinated car, en masse. Similar tests. helang started blaming us rakyat.

Sigh. Fauci even supports schools reopening. visiting foreign country, getting visa first basic common sense. Depart without visa, want use international news grab visa? sounds like US. CA clinics offered $25,000 ""donations"" hill literally die on. anymore. Tier 2 teachers “dope” pension. Side note Healthcare never considered economic transaction societal need. People dying always worse economy (More money move less hands leading top getting everyone else suffers) that's also Healthcare system bullshit. 

COVID spread, dead infinitely worse economy anything else. takes freezer break help decent pace................ Yes, Desantis wants much tourism get. means getting country's rich come vaccine, he's it. Total tangent; thought great movie. People aren’t spreading covid outdoors. spread indoors, primarily work home. We’ve known beginning. Stop spreading unfounded fear. Stupid decision? must know majority experts said returning school better option. Didn’t Trump leave WHO?  Can’t sign room. asking Americans stay subject iraqi laws fair request? Genuine question, know nothing topic. likely back March. never symptom. know several people though. Plenty nurses replace take vaccine killing elderly. know, that’s sorta point nursing homes, keep elderly alive. Maybe lockdowns job, huh. Covid alert level system (from 1 4 depending severity response). memory, highest level funerals limited ten people lower levels relaxed 50. seeing way way 20-30 y/o infections lately
In area wonder reason. Faster spread vs before. don’t think much good evidence measures don’t create many problems solve.

Lots unintended consequences. Like people crammed trains UK escape lockdowns went effect. conversely, happened India tried avoid happening announced hard lockdown hours effective immediately, people rioting didn’t enough food last lockdown weren’t prepared lockdown. People died exhaustion trying walk hundreds miles get home food everything back.

I know somebody starved death direct result nursing home quarantine Canada.

In town food bank close rules (unintended consequence sure) liquor store head shop stayed open. (Alcoholics die going cold turkey, sure excuse head shop)

This short list unintended consequences “measures”. Then, gets 11. Well, given election yesterday guess we'll see. parties long History talking big shit. Democrats turn actually govern. expect they'll they've always done; raise taxes tiny bit show add enough loopholes billionaire donors actually pay new taxes. New majority leader going Schumer whose deep Wall Street even funny.  NZ rural farmland though, densely packed cities ones get covid think people hear fellow citizens would want this, fear eventually happen. gets in, could adapted slowly without people noticing.

To clarify, I'm huge fan free/affordable healthcare everyone country. India. Grocery store workers way higher risk information know viral old honest. Given kids super asymptomatic seems might well.. start slower hoped for, seems ramping up. Yep. one parent complain kid wasn’t getting enough work played video games day. kid handed single assignment semester, attended extra help sessions.  much body, choice. trying get China investigate since JANUARY 2020.  Yup, that's works. That's things work. Pool COVID = nightmare fuel me. true looks like trump got 20 million ""vaccine doses"" done then. wild reservoirs going come back haunt us decades.

Bats supposed great virus reservoirs. bats living roof grandfather's farmhouse. never killed anybody deadly disease. 

Wild animals living natural environment behave differently wild animals living crowded unsanitary cages. looks like may never pinpoint exact location SARS-CoV-2 jumped species barrier; however, doubt happened one wildlife farms sponsored Chinese government increase rural living standards. 

Mink may carry kinds pathogens, mean infect us live natural environment. Its. A. Fucking. Island. population like small us city. good you. Crap. hope they’re able fix algorithms right people power accidentally get vaccinated first. Every Canadians need reminded could always worse.  got furlough support. think 500quid check sufficient people worked pubs restaurants etc., you’re deluded. incompetence. Priority good idea working.

While think lot finger pointing towards Feds failures distribution overwrought (we need Feds set websites deploy national guard stick needles peoples' arms), bear responsibility states developing half assed plans complicated.

Both FDA (who paid way much attention slicing baloney thin possible respect ""deserved"" vaccine) OWS (who mandated state plan quickly devolved baloney slicing exercise) seriously fucked up. lots, you’re probably thinking resident protests Stanford. fair data could 2-3 days behind prediction 1/4 6 million may fair comparisons.

Not that, massive difference. dangerous international flight right now?

I want move grandparents Korea next months, I’d fly Toronto, Canada, I’m sure that’s good idea not. risky would be? would really weird Canadians stopped talking American Healthcare ... rate 11 per 1 million vaccinations, administering staff trained monitor respond reactions occur.

If history allergic reactions vaccines, reason avoid vaccination.

compare Trump rally 1% 

that huge difference Perhaps...  
...if use breath distance ASAP. stated Hawaii isolated NZ it’s not. what's density land area 60% mark? saying wrong, way prove facts wrong. could bit civilized well.

But thanks information! give people struggling politicians spend money themselves? Exactly. You’re reinforcing article’s getting at: US government manage pandemic well. true assuming infrastructure backup oxygen supply Uk 66 million people. Again. that’s India know.

Where from? consistently see people saying every kid majority kids get permanent heart damage Hoiw successful been? Perhaps writing local newspaper might help. I’m thinking meant population density. Nothing freakier recent spike negative reviews amazon scented candles smell. That’s really ignorant statement. Must awful hate country much. lot better majority country, that’s point. 

Minnesota 1 50 states one country. New Zealand one country. Sorry, forgot precede comment “Ackshually...” long meet requirements: ""Most people require testing decide around others; however, healthcare provider recommends testing, let know resume around others based test results.

Note recommendations **do not** apply persons severe COVID-19 severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised). "" seems like governments saw vaccines coming around holidays said, ""fuck it, wait next year get serious"". 

Now finally seem like things picking steam many sites opening public furious elected officials. 254 samples total? telling mRNA vaccines capable curing every single virus cured human body's natural immunity, effectively every virus exception HIV minor exceptions. we're fine. *Says close 100% masks-*

Cover image unmasked person.

Also, saw 7 unmasked people first 15 seconds... NZ‘s population actually concentrated five main urban areas. Auckland, density 2400 sq/mi; Wellington it’s 2300 sq/mi. Honolulu’s density 5791 sq/mi, definitely greater nowhere near magnitude you’re suggesting. 

You bringing quarantine protocol reinforces issue. US government ability tighten procedures ensure there’s reduced risk imported cases. NZ government did. Hawaii’s government not, evidently. What’s point you’re trying make mentioning this? Leave media help conspiracy theories doubt thing get us mess smh Ok, US President May BLM protests flare threatening destroy months NZ-style quarantine effort successfully keeping up. stop them, exactly?  give milligrams virus could infect thousands people. Pretty hard one persons viral load.  According US ranked 14th covid deaths per capita, behind lots countries much stricter restrictions (such Italy, Peru, UK, Spain). expected everwhere though eventually? people die covid, lot people would died soon, lack deaths coming months show decreased death rate. Death rate UK lower usual waves. Might more. states aren’t reporting every day letting know 2 friends still waiting results positive last summer.

The 2 positive results today, 1 ill get tested, lost taste/smell (don't think got test obvious it).

If 2 pending come back positive 3 definite reinfections. wait see. Seems states aren’t reporting quickly. California number several days LOL. essentially you’re echoing point, insulting me, you’ve got wrong person.
It pretty funny say ‘you’re correct, makes stupid’. People think rushed bc they're ignorant usually goes cut time around.  certain point akin pulling unconscious person burning car accident. supposed move trauma victims around? No, spine damaged might paralyze them, alternative *definitely* burning death, acceptable risk. people definitely going suffocate without medical oxygen, industrial oxygen starts look lot attractive. automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.

Almost everything else open either limited capacity and/or outdoors only.

Sorry, universally true. researchers representing WHO; therefore are, fact, WHO. Executive Committee supposed accompany researchers official audit? Please.

Bot accounts maybe? turn air volume every 15 minutes? No, not.  I’m going memory Week Virology podcast months ago, IRC turnover instead measured hours government buildings. So, it’s relevant. tests since start pandemic, really give idea current testing levels Interesting read, made think comment weeks Well due respect, nobody skip 10 days ahead

The often quoted 95% efficacy figure 7 days second dose exactly that. They've skipped first 7 days post second jab.

All need communicate public vaccine takes weeks take effect, really Finally, would submit stopping spread least important preventing serious disease.

If vaccinate vulnerable populations quickly less problem know vaccine stops infectious.

No don't. However, know 500 brits day dying disease, use first fact vaccinate many high risk groups possible reduce mortality numbers hospital alleviates majority pandemic.

The sort numbers UK looking population worth 90% deaths UK receiving dose 1 mid February. Imagine pedantic 

In terms country wide lock downs, days immediate do. Good god, Redditors annoying lmao Unless I’m misunderstanding mean, reason teachers risk interact many different students. work small school (not America we’re online anyway) average day probably contact least 100 different children.

Are ""other diseases"" describing highly infectious?

 mortality rate 30 extremely low, 

Did ever look hospitalization rates here. Sure living many end hospital one point another, 40 50 and.... think ""just old people"" look data again. 

Here fundamental question: many chambers gun empty get hold head every single morning? think right ask anyone else that? pushing ""opening things up"" exactly that, pushes risk people back world. 

The question, wont answer this: many dead people acceptable number? Looks like US (again) broken (it's own) record daily deaths. May well breach 4,000 end week. Incredible. 1% US population got covid19. that's China, number would 140 million people. even 140 million hospital beds entire world. Newfoundland?  Im originally myself. Currently South Korea travel regularly Vietnam.  really stretch compare two imaginable way No, lot foreign workers Court rooms venting tho. Hows relevant?.. Chinese side said actions anti-China

Oh no, must hurt. Nice job going way make speculative argument America worst... ""Italy UK deaths per capata?

It’s old people hospitalised. intention create divide biggest nemesis however... there's thing full protection one talking term real concept anyway, rendering debate moot.  Death suffering taken sight modern day society. happens hospitals care homes simply home. 

Add people (fortunately) never lived war, low child mortality good healtcare. witnessing dying death increasingly uncommon people.

This plays big part people find death numbers abstract move changing behaviour. came across facebook feed cause follow them. used work hospital, great place work! huge community cheers figuring way distribute vaccine rather letting waste!

Also, best damn hospital food ever lol. said immoral different amoral. able fearmonger Reddit comment maybe science behind 52% effective dosage isn’t good governments telling are. done conversation feel there’s nothing add.  think that's problem here. Part reason could orofecal transmission resulting benign intestinal form Covid. Dharavi slum Mumbai example much lower IFR compared Mumbai non-slum (by factor 4).

I remember reading paper showed Covid mortality higher communities access clean water. correlation still stood data waa adjusted confounding factors like age. mean undermine approaches elsewhere though brand 'medically amoral'.

That's fearmongering. would interesting SA strain turns mutation UK strain, rather independent mutation.

 would convenient medicine deal UK one higher chance effective SA one. 3-4 weeks reach ~80% immunity second dose given. already multiple (likely many) strains COVID. Isn’t possible reinfection occur catching different strain first time? I'm fucking tired shit. I've may may sore throat ever since finished semester December. I've inside ever since, I've missed snow came (and probably come NY winter again). mention runny nose comes disappears whenever decides to. I'm actually scared whatever last months. Madness think gone last 10 months still implemented. No, didn't. knesset gave citizens time prepare lockdown order create rush supermarkets. public health officials saying two vaccines like said, personal opinion case consequence me.

Fingers crossed gets vaccine soon dont think April/May Rational, logical things course. Lol doubt interest That's sad, hope pulls through. Well due respect, nobody skip 10 days ahead. need take account, especially epidemic currently raging UK. also probability false sense security. People may take risks jab, could offset probability vaccine causing immunity. 

Finally, would submit stopping spread least important preventing serious disease. problem know vaccine stops infectious. 

Sorry UK cavalier imo.  WHO. bunch researchers sent. matter what, need visa enter country. Wrong, they're going keep forever. Month five, nostalgic retrospective sampler That’s scientists medical trials keep telling this? Yeah I’m glad won’t getting half vaccine since tested.

We indebted guys Allied soldiers fought WWII, hope history look upon event amount significance future generations learn always stand science truth, freedom humanity. team showed China without visa. expect lol? course they're gonna get quarantined first, get documents sorted out, etc. WOW - please explain China blocked investigation... article states issued Visas, part need allow investigation happen. Therefore, issuing visas blocking investigation - really ignorant? want last line *don't* 10k. see could go wrong? understand what's happening. sort consensus I've heard professionals schools priority open likely super-spreading virus *BUT* schools open low levels community transmission (and factors like hospital capacity, capacity mitigation measures, etc.)

Of times, schools opening *now* community transmission levels all-time high?? Sure, second wave hitting Chicago bad as, say, LA, community transmission levels still significantly elevated months ago.  That’s coz China don’t want world find covid created lab dentists Spain lower rate infection general population peak pandemic. surprising, touch mouths time!

I don’t get talk much anymore. Almost like predicted almost year ago, problems like without proper lockdown, true. live ignored summons. DA isn’t prosecuting non-violent misdemeanors anyway. worth getting covid.  wouldn’t over. It’s way easy spread especially larger countries. soon reopen cases go up.

Second, droplet transmission large small respiratory droplets contain virus, would occur near infected person. Third, airborne transmission smaller droplets particles suspended air longer distances time droplet transmission.

## Abstract

Lasting immunity critical overcoming coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors drive development high titers anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies long antibodies persist remain unclear. objective comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort defined time points determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist identify clinical demographic factors correlate high titers. Using novel multiplex assay quantify IgG four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, found 98% COVID-19 convalescent subjects anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels decline three months symptom resolution (n=79). expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. demonstrated first time COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea low appetite, correlated consistently higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. results provide new insights development persistence anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. don’t look getting vaccine?

? used someone collecting nasal swab realizing someone symptoms two months testing positive? still say shedding? really great news... rest world.

Whereas south africa... look hope government eventually finds someone bribe contract buy vaccines them. probably 2023, given demand currently high.

But least data suggest we'll great then! I'm basing literally actual knowledge willing proven wrong. 
But far aware unlikely virus become simultaneously infectious lethal. believe chances lethality probably slightly lower, hell could significantly lower massive increase cases what's driving increase death. understand IFR kids COVID literally lower flu right? Also, grade schools drivers, merely correlate community spread. Ok claim ""New York alone expired doses people vaccinated"" evidence substantiate make up? Exactly. lack openness really comes back haunt here.  
 
They *may* vaccine that's fine, even surprised take lot effort get people trust it. think meant threat dissuade actionable...  need replaced. Simple that. Well people want get tested put quarantine. people werent selfish assholes issue would elimanted. 
I lucky still studying ( well kind of- online learning sucks) really go anywhere except basic shopping. want get almost certain would die thousands people dying would say otherwise. understand person reading unfiltered informed opinions topic without asking clarifying questions would apt believe 7% infections susceptible reinfection much likely die others (to unspecified degree)? without context words scary? research concerned individuals unless start see sort pattern emerge (which might coming soon mild/asymptomatic individuals lower titers).

And keep pushing possibly severity data don’t know best worst non issue. 

I think I’m frustrated that, layperson, look guidance get lot context facts disconnected reality. It’s job assuage fears, you’re commenting sub specialist believe it’s responsibility say “vaccines work continue work studying natural antibodies reinfection. Take grain salt document reinfections it’s see day.” UK lockdown, everything's still open,roads chocker,you still go pub get takeout! 

Car sales opposite work still selling cars,shit,even work,this called lockdown jack,come March we'll still shit show,, he'll open stuff up,and bang we're back square one,the UK going round circles.

He either shuts everything,and mean everything 2 Months,or says fuck it,and opens everything let us get it!! Eh, voting China every round. thee not. mistaken. Look data. way seal example NYC major European cities way NZ did.

You absolutely can. Look Melbourne did, sealed 3 months rest Australia went without restrictions.  Well states offer drivers licenses illegal immigrants that's specified real ID Japan even cases us nearly double population even elderly well. Shedding almost always used scientific literature indicate live virus. Thanks fixing that. Yes, America hard actual discussions lately. seems ask question questioning opposing someone’s narrative, opposite side seems get hostile quickly. I, personally, like ask questions try understand people say do. can’t learn change thinking attacked asking. don’t answer (obviously) still uncomfortable mandating vaccines. also assume don’t vaccinate reasons rather health reasons either A. Don’t enough information make comfortable vaccine B. Don’t believe information heard regards vaccine Covid thus see caring family. sure good idea that.

What isn’t good idea make top enforcements.

Catching early everything sure. don’t, doubling won’t fix it.

Check 27 times non-Covid excess deaths Covid deaths 45 age group. colossal fuck-up. would happen vaccinate everyone country. I'm saying every 20 year old first line. compassion elderly. relatives China won’t even take it, they’d take Pfizer blink eye due Christmas 3 days reach peak positive tests, 10 days peak death Ohhh, see mean. frustrating. think that's true, understand. Yeah, historically underestimated upper bounds potential Covid related deaths. think 2B reasonable bound top end plausible deaths unless thing mutates severely. media spits headlines repeats things without talking odds. 

I may find suitcase full cash tomorrow, who's say otherwise. probably not. long scalable. whole country half population NSW think low pop would make much easier manage financially distancing wise  New Zealand lockdown shut down. Europe awe flying everywhere thought banning planes exist. live England completely shut airports situation would different. Whenever Covid discussed always end asking everyone question China us seemingly can't respond. despicable regime everywhere like virus. Interesting media spend every minute writing ""fast food may kill tomorrow!"" 

There certainly enough deaths warrant headlines. Honest question: also look population density right? Keep hearing conflicting information this. Pretty sure work higher concern guess might reduce efficacy? Youre still talking \~1.8 billion people dying it. dont know % people long term effects like that. saying things like wearing mask flu season ""staying fuck home"" cold instead going work good idea even pandemic. nearly zero negative impact. 

What learn pandemic react early determined. need lock whole countries stop spread early. None would happened locked tracked early cases isolated them. two week shut hundred cases trends showed increase. way, would ""magically disappeared"". Ignoring experts said listening idiots like Trump Johnson got us now. single brain cell hold** love kiwis hope live forever sounds like you’re saying currently circulating antibodies protect actual infection. 

Essentially, yes. Circulating antibodies protective immunity. Without them, get level long lasting antibodies impossible. 

I never said this. Around 7% people seroconvert. produce antibodies virus. antibodies create severe infection.

This studies seem indicate. severe infection, body goes hyperinflammatory response. leads generation autoantibodies targeting self furthers hyperinflammatory there’s sure fire way protect someone severe COVID then, shape public policy? developing vaccines?

Most people hyperinflammatory response... people clear virus fine generate immune response. research concerned individuals unless start see sort pattern emerge (which might coming soon mild/asymptomatic individuals lower titers). 

As vaccine, induce hyperinflammatory response. produces targeted response RBD protective least severe disease. Whether protective spread determined. Yeah. distinguish Australian dollars American dollars. AKA freedom bux. covid 1 week ago virtually immune like would viruses worry new strand effecting antibodies virtually immune different strands currently ? said shed virus. didn’t say live dead. didn’t mention using assays determine infectivity. surprise. Ugh Brazil. born (living US) I’m ashamed they’re flat ignoring it. family members saying treat virus never existed first place wear mask you’re weirdo. county CA stopped reporting dashboard last 2 days - Santa Clara AZ early November. Bars open, packed one wearing masks. woman approach saying “we don’t wear masks here. don’t live fear.” Yes, one guy working plant taking bioreactor contents home whole lot likely go undetected whole biowarfare program. Lol - I’m gay - don’t deal women all. It’s great. rate high, must massively testing. able stay safe? BTW, retail workers unbox stock, bunch people room together. wear masks, can't always distance order work. Thank you. He’s totally fine time crazy. good 10 years though. know mother telling go simptoms chance incubating ye thanks many freezer malfunctions now? speed UK reach 100k deaths end January. Terrifying. Stay home folks may? may not? pointless article?  go see bro ""Have y'all trying reclassifying restaurants? sell bags potato chips $5 give em 'free' beer purchase. Works great Texas!""

:-/ Relative, person kids school. used ammonia inhalants smell, insane. news outlet made statement certainty. definitely feel dumber 2020, infected (that know of). No, don’t think data wrong. think lack ability present compelling way helps policy remind need middlemen science reporting. 

Nothing doctors scientists article say completely contradiction you’re saying, it’s address practical application data real world circumstances. 

For finding reinfections literally job. biases talk believe it’s common important. It’s see. 

For others, it’s part whole. 

So say “7% documented infections don’t develop antibodies means reinfection happens need prepare everything goes it” say “it’s likely 93% cases develop antibodies protected least 3 months”. mean, yes one functions. Kind hard exist society you’re obligated supervise child 24hrs day. it’s like sort safety net provide childcare. Western Australia mean? Reddit gives random awards free every days so, likely free award. need set cut-off dates groups. I'm high risk would drop everything go get would offer me. However, several groups line me. instituted cut-off dates (like healthcare workers want get January 15th, delay get line next group, starts certain date). maybe vaccines sitting there. 

But instead California state board nursing sending threatening letters nurses warning face penalties, including losing nursing license, vaccinate people federally recommended prioritization order. seems wrong.

It's people less compromised situations symptoms shed virus long stated cancer patient.

Shed virus... positive test. Shed virus. live virus. thing happened Mexico. One top health authorities went vacation last weekend seen beach restaurant. one telling people stay home, visit family definitely travel. claims visiting family one weekend. 

Unfortunately, President several politicians came support justify actions saying needed break. People support president political party same. feel really bad actually followed rules specially doctors break months.

Seriously, screw people. wipe customers.  plexiglass, would totally fine.
You could spot kids come need help, instead going desks, behind plexiglass. I'm scientist either, seems question - 

under-20s relatively likely catch new variant compared over-20s, vice versa. Over-20s likely catch original virus, compared under-20s. see things open shut causes that.

Study says (""VOC"" new variant)

""We observe small statistically significant shift towards 20s affected bythe VOC non-VOC variants (Figure 4), even controlling variation week region. However, earlier results, observation resolve mechanism might underlie differences. Differences age-distributions VOC andnon-VOC community cases may result overall increase transmissibility VOC(especially time lockdown force schools open), increasedsusceptibility 20s, apparent symptoms (and thus propensity seek testing)for VOC age range.""

I hope end scaring people taking things seriously. Especially may infected early pandemic original Wuhan strain rather something like D614G (as original reinfection data came scenario indicating may even less immunity mutant strains).

That's happy end life. keep pushing possibly severity data don’t know best worst non issue.

Because that's ""publicly"" available information confirmed cases indicates. Take hint there... Look reinfection N63, seasonal coronavirus targets ACE2. Higher titers reinfection often leading severe infection. sort ""self"" protection mechanism going here. think possibly happening antibodies generated may targeting self-virus complex (ACE2-Spike). good portion would eliminated body rather quickly could potentially target cardiomyocytes (that also express ACE2), essentially killing heart muscle. may survive. survive, second infection severe cardiac side things. eliminated, body may recognize future ACE2-Spike complexes ""self"" eliminate B cell chance respond infection. believe it’s responsibility say “vaccines work continue work studying natural antibodies reinfection.

I'll address holistically now: obviously self centered missed whole fucking point everything, like; last 11 months, everything. wait long thing still fairly new really seen side effects may immediately apparent. mean, places 9 months, appreciable amounts longer 8 months.

It's suspected post-polio (a disorder emerges couple decades later people polio child) caused damage motor neurons. Motor neurons motor cortex CNS (brain stem + spinal cord). COVID latches onto ACE2 receptors damages surrounding area--that's lose sense smell, olfactory support cells become damaged. damage produces puffy scar tissue go away. places ACE2 receptors highest concentration around organs (some others) CNS. could see something like post-polio come out?

Another thing I've thinking about, hinders pancreas' ability produce/release insulin, could see jump type 2 diabetes? They've received vaccine countries. Surprising many people understood yet. UK variant containable. database things currently hosted.

The problem lack genetic sequencing that's huge gap observation mitigation pandemic. information *is* conflicting results yet. reasons people think strain evades antibodies (structure, epidemic country origin, anecdotes medical worker reinfection) reasons vaccine immunity still work.

China refused send vaccine samples Canada testing. WTF wrong country??? Would rather 3000 1500 people die per day US? number cases drives restrictions

This case numbers directly correlate hospitalizations right now. vaccinated at-risk population, correlation broken.

It's shame many people making point ""great barrington"" people rightly criticized, arguing achieve ""focused protection"" environment significant community spread. hand, clearly correct vaccinating high risk groups achieve *real* ""focused protection"" makes community spread far less worrisome senior citizens people comorbidities.

Thankfully, least non-""great barrington"" people prominent voices public health community seem saying thing, making distinction imagined ""focused protection"" isolation elderly real ""focused protection"" vaccines. political leaders even cautious jurisdictions using language ""until vaccines widely available"" seems amount vaccination priority groups, *not* ""full herd immunity."" However, risk growing chorus ""yeah but's"" deaths hospitalizations die spring still there, worries bit. 50% effective? Ireland better. Still better EU. states update week.... downvotes? He's right.

Okay made prediction based new science gut feeling country finally listen him. literally says he's making prediction based new science. evidence want? science say? infectious UK variant that's probably US now. infectious virus mean people need Maybe fully truthful outset problem; obviously, we'll never know got dishonesty misleading opening salvo 

Trump said would end Easter, Facui said would not. Fauci right. beginning said it'll year we'll vaccine available everyone, right. said 200K people die virus 10K deaths (even believe that), right. said would worse second wave, right. 

Not sure forgot this. People probably prolonged lockdown given clear endgame clear win conditions.

You paying attention. way know reach point. New Zealand predetermined condition endgame, found cases virtually zero, lifted quarantine. Besides, highly doubt every American agree prolonged quarantine sake ""freedoms"". naive say. Doctor said test unreliable, especially long. What? passed correlating healthy obesity? healthy  mere 200 years later we’ve hit 7.7 billion.

Welp, goes economy America better EU tho. ... many front line medical staff working fields unrelated COVID, e.g. areas care, even less/non-essential services exist they're money makers hospital. point becomes stretch say ""everyone"" healthcare get shot before, e.g., grocery store workers can't work home, need show job face deranged anti-mask protesters...

But point debate priority much observe system complicated artificially slowing process really needs running much much quickly.

One issues called state fact capacity vaccinate hospital staff less week, plan away ensure proper coverage top folks getting exposed community, employee reaction needs take day need let that. 

My hope start vaccinating without considering that, flow vaccine starts consistently coming start vaccinating faster pace. many people know swim Clorox spray wipes clean everything

I agree. Pandemics hard stop. People imperfect don’t follow rules. learned last pandemics, failed implement time, quarantining usually work contexts. theory do, practice life messy.

You UK trying contain local outbreak super contagious mutation, people run trains get area, packing shoulder shoulder trains try avoid lockdown.

You town shut food bank leaving head shop liquor store open “essential”(because kill alcoholics go cold Turkey)

I know person starved death direct result imperfectly planned nursing home lockdown.

All well-intentioned unintended consequences.

The bottom way imperfect well, everyone comply, making judgement calls appropriate unique situation place time. remember summer cause cases go seasonal even though went pretty much everywhere summer Super Mega COVID-3000 74k cases reported Monday alone CA. Holy hell called jury duty Washington November. tried use Covid reasoning said everyone required masked times. 

I ecstatic called Friday find trials jury duty period cancelled. Normally love jury duty, right it. shots ready go, people prioritized right getting creating artificial bottleneck. Everyone says follow science drs psychologist saying kids lacking social interactions thats far detrimental well being

Don't worry. People agree potential detriment mental well-being important covid letting kids hang friends maskless. much longer results vaccine approved? 2-3 weeks? politician requested come back...

In area, county health agency saying straight ""we dunno we'll get doses, we'll put TV, newspaper website. vaccination day, it'll first come first served, pack lunch probably line 4 hours."" 

Which sounds less ideal, least honest. Presumably they'll clicker gadgets note many people line, hit (for example) 500 people day, decency tell anyone behind them, ""sorry we've run out, keep eyes peeled next one"" I'd rather membership Jelly Month Club.

Look quickly LA crumbling. First hospitals getting full, add massive amounts people sick, Amazon, Costco, mass transit system, others starting fall. soon may sanitation workers, fire/police. could get wild, especially shit headed toward proverbial fan. I've gotta honest, think way it. I'm loving priority tiers anymore. United States almost twenty million vaccines distributed right now. looking around 6% country received first dose instead 1.6%.

The tier system works well perfect world live perfect world. want see headlines pharmacies running vaccines, hospitals sitting certain people working decided want yet, nursing home residents school teachers dying inaction.

I'm warming idea complete abandonment career based prioritization favor semi open vaccination system. think reserve disproportionately high risk, like nursing homes serious comorbidities, small amount total vaccines, them. vaccines going whomever wants with. yet particular defendant awaiting trial year half.

That, me, equally ridiculous holding jury trial pandemic notifying anyone exposed covid trial. Yea right, course everything China fault. 

China knew Trump incompetent, releasing virus would cause much damage US. 

Therefore, purposely released virus city, Wuhan, putting country millions citizens risk, virus could hopefully spread US cause damage. 

Yea, sounds right. OMG, RvB series OG Xbox modded. days indeed! least vaccine. No. wouldn’t. ICU beds land full, would doctors nurses man beds hospital ships.

We say x many “beds” don’t mean beds, mean beds put patient provide care patient.

We beds staff man them. remember people making fun Vietnam locking entire province like dozen cases. many countries eat bill acting quickly strictly. That's good point. there's two bottlenecks there. know least 5.05 million shots went arms, certainly number right now. imagine, poster said true, there's probably vaccinations taking place speak Kansas get state tonight, result recorded national level until...Wednesday, January 13th.

Which really matter, annoying accurate picture. long result infections, matter. wear N95 11 hours straight would convince take trip would save life you’re either extremely callous person pathetically weak person, both. would problem what's happening healthcare/essential workers. thawed vaccines people rejected expected. people neighborhood scheduled next day home today. waste time mess organized rollout looking random arms jab. educated response. response someone thinks smart understand basic science.

The story Mary Mallon, [or Typhoid Mary purposely spread typhoid. Blame Trump investigated found wrongdoing. addition person said, article mentions work scientists studying viruses Coronavirus family (SARS MERS).

This possibly important takeaway people afraid vaccine development Chinese scientists published SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence internet Jan. 10, 2020, multiple vaccine programs started within days existing vaccine design methods could repurposed.

This vaccine effort *has* gone way faster previous one, large part able hit ground running. Scientists reinvent wheel design vaccine completely scratch.

The new mRNA vaccine technique makes easier faster make vaccine virus got genome sequence. Moderna already developing mRNA technique deal viruses -- list they've got development pipeline -- heard new coronavirus said ""hey, bet could use stuff this"". Kaiser recruiting participants Moderna's Phase II safety trials live (Seattle area) back March; far know trials technically still going on. (From read recruiting material, ""vaccine testing"" mostly consists getting shots waiting see happens. Moderna/Kaiser trials wanted monthly followup doctor's appointments 14 months IIRC.)

Other aspects things went fast include able throw ton money clinical trials, able recruit trial participants fairly easily, running separate phases trials pretty much parallel, #1 priority regulators review data. (A normal drug vaccine would wait line behind drugs FDA would reviewing, right?)

The high infection rate (particularly US) also silver lining speeding long Phase III efficacy trials took. drug manufacturers said ""we'll wait get X number infections participants look see whether real vaccines better placebo"" boy ever get X number infections real quick. took weeks instead months.

Now still possibility rare side effects problems. definition going catch one-in-a-million things might happen trials done 30,000 people; can't catch possible long-term effects something existed long-term. tested enough people catch common side effects long enough there's time catch usual big things.

Anybody who's afraid long-term issues vaccines needs consider long-term issues getting disease. We're learning pretty bad. Would people listen cancelled Christmas? Even lockdown compliance low compared March. people know primarily disease old obese reacting accordingly.

WTF yeah need vaccinate people go hospital isnt entire country. change fast... absolute chaos operative level :-( France even worse :-P Would lawsuits appropriate here? Facebook must true. expect highest standard journalistic integrity, scientific discourse rational thought news feed. think Vietnam believe results course, unfortunately maybe caught accusations face similarly located countries obscure test numbers test find like 20%+ positive cases. 

Thailand facing outbreak right now. also locked (though little later Vietnam). saw great success, testing infrastructure. believe things control, outbreak people trust numbers barely test anyone. 

They recently screened 3,800 workers proactively found 900 cases one day, added top daily figure 350 caught normal testing. happens, people assume lot rampant reported (but clearly bad overwhelm hospitals). Anecdotally also heard Thai family reports doctors told reclassify deaths non-Covid related beginning pandemic. 

Of course relevant Vietnam, explains people distinguish Southeast Asian nations may caught thought process underlying distrust. Yep people idiotic haters. China thanked first recognize virus sequence RNA, instead tops minds Reddit shit relentlessly. little credit given China going 6k cases day days less 10, best response world. Yes local Wuhan officials screwed response, got fired, heads CPC took over, happened? imagine it, lying ground, wheezing air finally paramedics walk door.
""Oh thank god!"" think.

Paramedics: ""Declare time death""
 
Wtf Well, free ambulances respond emergencies get people holding area. Better holding area limited care stuck home care. sure downvoted, would desirable traits proud achievements. deliberately funded staffed well enough do. Vietnam - island, high population density many areas, handled better almost everyone. deaths July 31st 35 total. normal last 12 months. Covaxin rolled onto younger age group, vaccines tested people 18 Covaxin administered 12 year olds. also easier store kept refrigerator instead special freezer.

It's classic vaccine injects dead virus like typical vaccines different Pfizer Moderna mRNA type. makers Covaxin says make effective variation mutation virus.

We hard data exact effectiveness drug they're phase 3 now/rolling emergency use India. think going give lot data March. strain seems hitting younger people harder?

None them. There’s really proof scientific evidence saying this. Sequencing tell us dropout pretty good. dropout would indicate either UK SA variant believe? least know upper bound uk variant since always return dropout result.

And .5 5... yeah know, hard believe given big deal made variant. love shills saying first need approve visa.

China currently approving visas foreign workers, English teachers etc. Yet telling one year later still approved visa investigators?

Yeah that's suspicious all... Yep, additionally, DOL took 2 months investigate employer following FFCRA. Btw, bill longer active (I believe 80 hours sick leave bill expired December 31) done investigation call late October early November. Repost old article. I'll grab popcorn see xenophobic nationalist say time. Demonstrated, least. vaccine still effective posted twitter link research paper link. guy immunologist. fair comparison would compare islands, like UK Japan etc sounds America... werid, management faciility begging travelers extend contracts. Meanwhile rich buy vaccine free reign given virus, virus are, mutations occur. huge virus pool USA concerning. Theres lot potential mutations, may infectious, even severe. Imagine mutation doubled mortality rate, worse. current policy reckless. slow rollout ""fairness"", literal Federal one less person get sick strain healthcare system; one less person might transmit 

Let transmit wealthy buddies.

it's regular people choice go work exact people need another bonus. pretty standard refer ruling country either name country name countrys capital. Given context hard understand meant. really quite clear effective are. Mainly work better given early course disease. also expensive need given IV infusion. time people hospitalized, already late monoclonal antibodies much effect. rich people best medical care receive Regeneron treatment early, suppose. read article BBC scientists denied entry China unable post link! know goes grain. good thing people knew it. rich powerful going shady route get vaccine must safe. 

A large portion vulnerable waiting aren’t convinced it’s safe take it. News like might change minds. need attention badly could try pleasant likeable instead deeply boring stupid.

But whatever works, guess. slow trying vaccinate adults currenr approvals 240 million people.

Yeah, vaccines still 2-shot last checked, 480 million shots 240 million. fuck would want call Elon Musk.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup. far enough list think reasonable get back normal risk lowers. I'm looking things true: hospitals comfortably within normal levels, high risk people thier chance get vaccinated, cases trending down. Horrific news.  Holy smokes. finish reading it. far upsetting

I'm sorry going American friends. horrifying. Stay extra extra safe I’m mid twenties. reason, it’s idiots never tried school didn’t make tertiary education seem think know better qualified scientists. What's source number? Everything I've seen says think first dose confers 50%ish immunity population (not individual, though individuals get population less tough go without vaccine) that's official yet. China create covid virus bat's wuhan institute viral lab infects hela humans cells 2015. That's fact proud wiki years, pandemic wiki  rewritten fair bit, deleted etc. see last update 10hrs ago. asking healthcare professionals - respond people say medically exempt wearing mask ? (usual response ive asked given patient would like mask) 


im perpetually stuck ""its immune system, dont go hospital get symptoms"" cant actually say France vaccinated like 500 persons far. guess passed number morning. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Great news. Hopefully rollout process accelerated slightly believe meant getting doses March/April Sweden leaning extra hard herd immunity thing.
It's proven masks work slow spread, fuck science guess. police Trump-suckers. enforce Covid restrictions mask mandates. 100%. 

Eleanor would get pretending nurse.

Tahani would get gift charity continue travel go gala dinners.

Chidi would spend hours deciding whether take one hand, unethical take vaccine someone higher statistical chance death covid, but, hand, take vaccine spread group elderly people? Argh, much - oh shit freezer long worthless now?

Pillboi would sneak Jason heard make high. guess Texas vaccines set expire need excellent news hopefully help speed vaccination process EU, desperately need right now. still curious going Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine. bad press conference like last time, since journalist would surely ask there. That's awful excuse literally nothing all. 

""Yeah like dad math teacher course better test""

""Ok study""

""No dad math teacher course study"" AZ we’re starting see deaths Thanksgiving gatherings numbers (we 253 reported yesterday). takes weeks covid contracted til person dies weeks state report death. deaths get reported every day us 2-3 weeks prior. We’re going really ugly Jan Feb. Probably hospitals money edge financial ruin point. Well mean corruption corruption. 


It type government tries control people. government violating civil rights human beings government somewhere corrupt. Someone making lot money keep fear alive. 


So fear good helping everyone? fear able afford Healthcare? fear pandemic? fear government actions? 


We can't let fear corruption win. can't let powerful people accept suffering cost business. No. need remember every human wants thing. live purpose. can't live why? help? let's make comfortable. Take care innocent people can't change position. 


Do purpose? feel life fulfilled meeting purpose well without worrying pay bills eat? People innately good corruption greed evil. 


Raise fucking standards treated government. supposed represent us right? Write local government im talking county city. top corrupt. Start smallest community can. Gain momentum drive home together. must help live content. 


'Dum vita est, spes est. Dum Spes est, amor est. Dum amor est, vita est.'

While us life, hope. hope, love. love, life. 

-kenkaniff23 Nope, goes narrative. Yeah, SARS 1 isolated essentially died humans wasn’t contagious. short incubation period obvious symptoms, contact tracing isolation could happen could spread. Thanks telling I’ve done. /s/ fact insufficient data right rule potential serious long term side effects. It’s unlikely according speculation researchers, people, that’s sufficient. That’s choice. like see actual data. I’m saying won’t get vaccine. probably will. I’m saying wait bit info. lot? often wonder number dead folks would 99% everyone agree shut month? 1 million? 2 million? 10? flu deadlier medicine advance today. Look picture 1918 compare hospital setting today. course death rates would higher back then. r/Woosh What's scary people stop following harsher restrictions ""because overreacted first time, bad, even fewer deaths usual ..."" there's allotted death quota gotta fulfill. Probably asymptomatic carrier never got identified.  - occupation first
 - high risk next
 - age location

not rocket science takes actual coherent policy see many US states lack know. sad. feel sorry them. animation, ok, great. protect them. go groceries ebry 2 weeks, that's it. 
I fed ignorance LA.  Sad news. think funny sound like idiot depth here: comparison flu jab around 50-60% effective Good luck half country saying can’t wait ignore politics again. America money problem. Everything dictated money; legal process, medical care, education, policing, nothing safe US' insatiable hunger money. Even they're going faster they're targeting right age group hospitalizations deaths decrease faster there. state like 80% vaccinations far gone people ages 18-45. That's going move needle comes actually preventing deaths guy username masks4all makes fun talk people laughing wearing mask. Wow. I've Magnolia quite times, surprised this. guess. go check latest fish story Fox, quote you, stay mad, lol. ""I right follow law gravity,"" said, plummeting imminent death. nurses Doctors Ok, normally get annoyed grammar police find condescending petty.

This found useful informative. Thanks. Damn, seems applying logic, thinking earnings.  
 
On serious note, also read EMT services struggling financially, expect huge revenue ROI 2020&amp;2021. 
 
Already April 2020 problems:  could introduce infrastructural islands within EU. something like happens again, close them. 'just' plan implement early enough future. approach might good/bad side effects well. proportion? 10% normal.

2.9 Million + 299k covid tax. Right Pepper. Impact Christmas New Years mixing yet fully realised data, hump intake cleared hospitals, can’t risk stacking way implement national level means support population hard lockdown. work. Let's look another way. Turkey commited number Genocides (an example would Pontos country) called numerous times. push lies defame country actual historical facts needs always adressed? Turkphobia case? 
P.S: Got nothing Turkish people, clear. giving example troll here. closed borders (apart Brits coming back foreigners going back home country), forced quarantine 14 days Brits coming back countries, implimented proper track+trace, came lockdown cases reached 0 would far better now.

Doesn't matter population greater denser government balls competency this. think government. city, government pretty strict people listen. nothing else without federal government country permission.

Important mention city business industrial city country second populated. city population New Zealand.

Population lot weight case so, good effort made New Zelelanders too. also upsides: island, amount people enter controlled screened. Many european countries simply opportunity. People work across border basically stroll border nobody bothering you. enough border police able check traffic, monitor/block anough them.

Also, Taiwans cross-border traffic mainland China, already country low rates corona Anecdotally, nurse know won’t get it, doctors pharmacists know already gotten it. I’m South Carolina. still convinced going late spring based that.

People complying woth hundreds thousands cases thousands deaths day. 

When numbers come down, pressure lift restrictions great ignore. CNN aren’t ones it, made Faustian bargain ratings Trump became President. It’s essentially info-tainment point, “news”. Schools also closed. seems like real headline ""Anime-jerking Trump-sucker fails farming karma"".  EU neoliberal establishment through. one hand, national government goes right wing deep end, keep checks foreign relations, trade, worker consumer rights. However also prevent left wing governments achieving socialist goals like said. personally favor EU tories, ultimately believed UK left EU Corbyns labour. gut bloke outstanding. Absolutely awe article posted multiple times . comments get bombarded anti chinese sentiment mods come clean out.

Have fun investigation. can't identifying UK strain originated 4 months ago; doubt find anything outbreak 15 months ago. I'd prefer Trump fiddled. fair, america too. idea. write watch CNN isolate ones silly. [It passed Save save people! coincidence? not? /s 2^6 =64, 2^7 =128, yeah 6 7 days. There's really good article illustrating exponential growth BS. US could lockdowns late January and, could shut borders anyone returning residents, could mandatory quarantines people entering country starting January. didn’t even mandatory quarantines people returning cruise ship outbreak. 

We could ramped PPE production government guarantees everyone could get N-95 masks surgical masks starting January.

We could population-wide testing tests offering beginning.

To say would island small population true. people want see guy waving teddy bear front face instead actual news, that’s they’re going show, right? many people still think Jacinda horrible job closed borders far late economy apparently tanking? Like wtf. Sure price livings gone South Island always going happen New zealand practices xenophobic border lockdowns travel restrictions. Brit scientists discover new variant, get blamed it

“The fuck do?” Jumping line bank account evil bullshit. people literally taking live-saving protection people need more, makes monsters. think find origin Wuhan, China. bending rules long pandemic vested interest reporting people want see. like fade obscurity state public health improves. new stories. Three literally islands. fourth one - and? 

Some basic logic you:

-A makes B easier;

-this mean that, absence A, B becomes impossible.

Also, comes covid disease spread general, really matters necessarily geographical isolation sense actual island. matters able functionally isolate yourself. island, especially remote one like New Zealand, absolutely extra advantage. I’ve thinking thing necessarily rich behind it. govt deferred bills made everyone stay home months would way better off. 

My thought since social security running money covid killing large percentages old folks, don’t care kicks road little til SS money. retire NZ? they're young healthy? hope mod take soon biggest problem infrastructure within hospital - enough piping route oxygen aground everywhere, pressure drop example. can't sensibly upgrade without closing wards, course can't they're overloaded. Ok **ALL** problems still Trump. fixed end month. Nothing makes think that. sure inferred that. posted link. See comments upthread. pace improve think will. Farm workers vaccine passport entry system vaccines aren’t yet available all? Agreed, thoughts add. think government totally flawed outdated better way run country. man never elected president first place.

That said, he's democratically removed power. I'm updating governments, non-US governments lack problems, President foreign influencers stop nothing keep power they're unable get 2nd term democracy US broken. 

Posters like /u/peppermint-kiss also remiss (or karma whores, perhaps plain ignorant) dismiss steps US taking update improve government. Examples would districting laws address gerrymandering, various changes improve voter registration access. big part last one extremely widespread mail-in ballot processing has, many cases, put permanent law. None supports ""incredibly broken"" rhetoric. 

If want pick issue US problems go back to, including Covid wildfire that's killing almost badly rates UK Italy, social policies producing US Gini coefficient would example far appropriate target. 

The ""one man"" question certain promoted damage this, start fire. 

I'd certainly hold feet fire Covid, one steps back looks what's happening around globe plainly obvious freer societies fewer mitigation options. going go badly US matter charge things normally benefit US free travel hundreds millions people. ""One man"" could used responded much effectively, rhetoric US system broken objectively falsified. tyrants better. anything say ongoing coronavirus pandemic whining media? Essential workers getting job. lot people don’t luxury sheltering home. Quick poll, many walk around proof citizenship wallet? Taiwan gold standard pandemic. approach here. previous experience SARS meant weren’t going make mistake twice! I’m doc got vaccinated 2 weeks ago. wait large group 15 min observation shot. Vietnam
Singapore
Taiwan
Hong Kong


Try really great apply job? wait case Oh, understand that. China physically huge country, contained hard lockdown one area. Eh, I'd say ""everyone 70"" going easier health care professionals quite busy right now. Nursing homes require dedicated personnel go site.

During final phases, considerably easier get shots arms concern schedule follow-up making sure particular profession. rich going get anyway. change nothing regard. see problem this, part problem. don’t think vested interest jiggling handle story long possible circles drain? Why? ‘...so humidity drops...’ bit misleading ambiguous. relative humidity measured indicated percent, absolute humidity given g/m^3 (grams per cubic meter). correct stating colder air hold less water vapor, ie absolute humidity lower. However relative humidity measure much water vapor air, current temperature, compared saturation value. relative humidity anything winter summer. layman think less humid air, relative humidity is, winter even fully saturated cold air, warmed indoor temperatures produce indoor relative humidity 20-40% depending climate.
In regards weather events, heavy snowfalls generally associated warm relatively moist air masses mixing colder polar air. Cold air masses simply can’t hold enough water vapor (absolute humidity) produce significant snowfall. See context article ""at current pace""

What makes think shitty pace ever improve? aren’t full lockdown talking about?! course has. People want know what's going on. surprising? ""unending"" competence response. mean what's reported sensational. many vulnerable people die meantime waiting make sure willing pay access shot? 

This vaccine people need lot people. 30% American deaths occur only
[1.6% population. Vaccinating everyone equally risk puts number deaths prevented week disappointingly low. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Looks like don’t hope Consistent harassment results ban. Apparently medical grade oxygen pure use industry. fear too. try remain hopeful. Without Oxford/AZ vaccine doubt vaccinate enough see noticeable difference summer Stay mad, lol agree it’s widespread already, Covid rampant area (suburban Pittsburgh) deniers swearing must new strain, seems like consequences would seen way acting strain summer actually winter.  

People shocked get together one person spread 8. people rejected virtually identical stories reported friends back NY March. live southern california GTFO...you so.

please spread disease hurt small businesses

lol fuck misspoke. 
It “take vaccine, don’t get Covid.” 
You still contract coronavirus causes it. terrible idea. vaccine available everybody, people allowed take risk catching virus choose get vaccine. Googled it, shit right. different. problem moment many EU countries vaccine numbers, getting there. Netherlands done zero, France 500 Greece logistical capacity 5000 day. matter one vaccine 50 vaccines unless sort shit shopping death wave. yet, recorded next excess mortality save moderate spike late December lower past seasonal flu spikes. probably means either restrictions prevented non-covid deaths, covid victims would likely died causes 2020 anyway. administer vaccines now

I'd take junkies point. [Me looking 50¢, take them. That's fantastic way start 2021! ""trickle vaccinations"" thing What's going Arizona California. Afaik much harsher restrictions Florida has. said long term safety testing would required escape mutation.

Hmm, believe responding another person, never claimed that. :) think obvious candidate someone sick real covid symptoms, stay home get care I’m still wearing mine required immunity second shot kicks (just first yesterday), however I’ll probably little lax comes taking precautions. Well, lot survivors going permanently less healthy, so... They're rude shock next decades expect. 1918 flu pandemic primarily affected people war young?

ah see comparing oranges apples. guess war sent world's young frontline infection runs rampant, would absolutely correct

read 1918 flu pandemic deadly 65. like people 65 spared, got sick died too. happen vaccines run out, chaos. think that's hospitals holding vaccinating quickly that's guess. would like mention EMA fuck themselves, also sure move approval date forward like Biontech Moderna. 

They said bullshit vaccines realized wasting time lol. “Stance detection system”?

Sounds rather Orwellian. biggest problem NYC reports data differently state reported data. Idk conflict varies drastically, state officially NYC area 6% range, whereas NYC says it’s around 9%. That’s drastic difference really impacts one would want take action. 

That said, New Yorker, despite thinking Cuomo fumbling second wave terribly, still support keeping kids schools. positivity rate cases tied schools low still, don’t see reason force children back remote learning it’s absolutely necessary transmission via schools becomes apparent issue. Since goal flatten curve vs. eliminate community transmission, schools really open. [Please read r/covid19's discussion Opinion piece fair amount misinformed comes bad Good news! Hope enough stocks article:

Is post-holiday surge? restrictions begin ease across Colorado, COVID-19 cases starting rise again. 

[Last week, state’s COVID-19 positivity 8.70%. week 10.97%. 7-day positivity rate last week 6.09%. week 8.06%. Nevermind conspiracy theorists, somebody needs stop comments Ivermectine legitimate cure! 

:D  see lots lawsuits future!! Haha American execptionalism again. told doctorate one group 8 would likely mean nothing you? work/study Australia. would expect purely American concept experience mean anything NZ? concept elite universities redundant NZ. Sure universities might perceived ""better"" particular major universities offer thing whole similar degrees different universities pretty much regarded same. would expect degree Harvard would perceived better degree university (other perhaps novelty Harvard perceived non Americans consumption American media making person stand bit more). Note: example completely theoretical.

But, would rather last line, get vaccine April proper place line, get vaccine May?


I believe exists dollar figure could charge want cut line would improve access all.

Now, turning practice another ball game. One think unsuccessful at. I'd liken ""Varsity Blues"" scandal. get pay ""front door"" fees would improve things all, they'd pay ""side door"" fees get someone scam one them. think people actually clicked article? oh cool iceland do? Australia's demands investigation are, part, blamed deterioration Australia-China relationship, China cutting billions dollars worth trade retaliation.

Seriously? need agree elect leaders willing put bullshit anymore. 

Thank god Australia balls. can't say much remaining world leaders. US politicians entirely morally bankrupt. I'm arguing, asking, know now? idea would happen are? good movie. Would love see covid-related remake. good news still enough cover EU. massviely failed buying vaccines. 

I hope get Oxford next least Biontech able produce man hope cage us entirety 2021 becuase entire population vaccinated. 

They lower restrictions soon vulnerable age group likely get hospitalized vaccinated. affect eldery population? understand cytokine storm happens? Ha ha ha, yes!!! thing surprise anyone haven’t heard sooner. I’d venture guess hospitals wealthy donors, execs board members

Even Bernie Sanders ""progressive"" pass primary. happens real American spirit brave break England. Amazing. curious, New Zealand anti vaxxer / anti masker / pandemic denier type people? Survey says /S Publicly flogged banned holding wealth kind. Clearly, can't trusted wield it. lose license, gun rights, voting rights, medical licence etc. proving I'm unfit hold privilege, wealth treated same? use wealth irresponsibility, danger detriment society, revoke PRIVILEGE? take away constitutional rights rarely ever wealth rights. federal government, president. Apparently one man band. Might well get rid entire government one person matters. isnt limb going on, well established science. slightly caricature picture capitalist medicine America. system within nation America shouldn’t capitalist healthcare, heeeeere mainly ""freedom"" people fighting it. parties cannot enforce rules without infringing freedom. Cannot China do. 

Have seen recent videos Anti-Mask protests LA? Vietnam create plan?

There denial human human, denial evidence true. Absence evidence mean evidence absence. American, super jelly said ""we"" referring people household. 

But yeah, bet man situation, would think special Lol found Italy earlier hahahah. We’ve got someone sneaking CCP. know people actually made changes Christmas celebrations (even family restricted celebrations COVID christmas). NYE, know way many people made parties houses. 


But proves control pandemic mostly hands people government. reasons reddit went specific witch hunt speak reddit users' cultural politics. r/conspiracy mindset believing ""catch bad guys"" la film noir heard several places running people willing take vaccine hospitals. point move next phase? Seems like shoveling thing whoever wants point since seems like everybody Germany covid deaths 34K year. Road accident deaths around 3K. Hot take American people put health wealth hands corporate still proud system baffles me. mind, two groups: common people ones try profit every penny people. Maybe can't change fact, celebrate put slaughterhouse. someone used work tv news, there’s way hospital lets camera crew film patients way. much risk exposing idenities. Even voices considered private health information could identify someone voice. Yeah, personally despise imbeciles prominently displayed front page world, stupidity, flinging shadow onto us least _trying_ spread it. succinct point.

Basically happening US, UK Japan (and host countries)

This virus political opportunity crush opponenents spread fake unscientific news Lol. Lest forget. huge gatherings, always bragging country zero cases. didn't. know I'm going say horrible, fact unfortunately.
If vaccines used, sick elderly die. remaining survivors stronger immune systems healthy. population whole healthier today. leaving natural selection unfortunately. exactly would happened 2000 years ago.
Again, fact, blam them, making observation. bad press conference like last time, since journalist would surely ask there.

Doesn't surprise they're suddenly longer interested transparency badly EU rollout seems going. unfortunate seem worrying political optics rather transparency saving lives. don’t think you’re wrong difficulty forcing contact tracing, least I’m didn’t even ask, put place measures let people try. opt app would better nothing. saying making elementary school (5-11 year old) kids go school share germs day remembering Covid19 existed sending back home learning kind mistake? China tried bury initial outbreak helped them. sure what’s wrong said. suck don’t choose one other. Gates completely right quote easy say billions dollars bank know pandemic hurt wallet. us, remaining 99% work live every month? going cover expenses? Another thing forgot mention Democrats Georgia probably another stimulus aid state/local governments ton money vaccine distribution! probably help lot California literally hell. Someone save them. single day thsi sub far read something terrible California too! Thats I'd love see covid-inspired remake. That's Central Texas.  also said this;

""But biggest priority vaccinate! Despite above, I'm confident current vaccines useful quite while. Reasons: (a) even worst mutations (ie, E484) erode neut activity sera, eliminate any, (b) current vaccines elicit strong immunity (c) evidence animals (&amp; humans 1st vaccine dose) modest immunity blunt disease, (d) natural immunity seasonal CoV provides homologous protection 3+ years even though evolve too."" Thanks spending time reading article, one else will. Headlines thing read reap updoots!!! Meanwhile way pay way vaccine priority list. It’s essentially punishment younger 50.

When you’re rich find alright, I'll trust opinion team epidemiologists wanted answer specific question analysis numbers provided vaccine manufacturer instead opinion random person Reddit wants use one analysis numbers source, matter much analysis makes clear made answer question Redditor asking. China released retrospective sample tests Wuhan last September, like Italy done Milan? No. easy claim China make data available, however absence evidence evidence absence. still questions, Good Housekeeping! Besides taking precautions stop disease spreading, seems like guy bit limb among colleagues. He's basically saying never tried use convalescent plasma ever consider delaying second dose vaccine. Obviously virologists think measures right call, even share level concern render vaccines impotent. say he's wrong, layperson trying follow experts think looks far consensus. like ""China suggests source coronavirus outbreak"".  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article way  county public health department (US) volunteer email contacted. expecting hear back. already doing?   first didn’t call China Virus, everyone says Britain covid-19 I'm shocked many people jumping conclusions without even reading information end link. know I'm supposed read as, ""yippee"" ""yipe"" 

Either way I'm ok predictable boring. I'm sure media intentionally omitting facts, think journalists many local news outlets horribly unqualified actually relay news. There's intellectual curiosity, often common sense. mostly ferry information comes spin machines (PR statements, police/fire departments, city hall, state houses, etc.) take sick pride challenging much they're sold: ""Just telling story.""

Thinking back classmates journalism majors, makes lot sense... also dont get  mature response That's plainly incorrect, many decisions that's taken correct line much Australia doing, many delayed, many questionable, mostly late. Australia position UK, population, absolutely way, even Australian leadership cases would contained. completely unrealistic. governments response poor many ways comparing somewhere completely different much smaller population much less travel virus reaching different times useless. Stupid bots removing comment guess ""nicer."" everyone get move cannot afford live somewhere. 
Figures packers fan. Can't argue stupid. 
Bye need send reeducation camps China. fucking kidding Find sportsball arena, set vaccination station.

Put call, anyone wants vaccine, come sportsball arena. Jab jab jab jab jab. Link STFU. Viruses want survive therefore need tradeoff transmission lethality, kills host quickly doesnt spread well lesser chance survival. Viruses typically evolve transmit kill slower however interconnected state world might change that.

Theoretically could already extremely lethal strain Covid localized geographic area killed host quickly wasnt able spread. That's basically playbook formed previous experience SARS epidemics. CDC estimated actual infection count around 91m people: 331m people US, 240m actually need vaccine. everyone needs achieve herd immunity. R0 highly debated thing right (mainly hard pin pandemic conditions), assuming something high 4.0 gives us ( 1 - 1 / 4.0 ) \* 240m = 180m vaccinations.

Assuming could start 1m/day today, we'll done Independence Day (seriously; 180 days today). Note take account natural infections, actually even less that.

We *really* need open flood gates. [I've tracking CDC they're 1m doses distributed per day. need get folks arms quickly possible slow spread eventually eradicate disease. totally possible significantly improved Spring almost normal Summer. anger remains (Not american citizens, country, american politicians news outlets)

Why think average American citizen different American politicians? democracy, politicians say things voters like hear. hear politician China good representation American people actually think. 

I would think Chinese people less naive United States now.  common. I’ve seen surgical masks worn (though didn’t venture hospital). mask usage high. Even outdoors, see around 60-70% people wear masks. helps it’s “cold” winter year, masks help keep warm wind face.  that’s tyranny! us serious medical conditions. lose job, lose health insurance need. None anything said, except maybe last two sentences. Taiwan Vietnam trust official news comes mainland China recognized importance severity threat extremely early. 18 million veterans America. That’s population many countries. can't get CA unless qualify yet

so....

what do?   saying possibility people taking vaccine getting immune response enough eliminate symptoms, thing studies look at, still leave amount virus active?

I think larger issue simply know happened people remained asymptomatic trials since included observational data access to. tested.

We know whether vaccinations enough eliminate symptoms. entirely plausible vaccine nothing them, going asymptomatic regardless, remained able spread it. claims based speculation rather observation.

The last part paraphrasing troubling entirely speculative. I'm growing tired Fauci's speculation, unfortunately. He's better scientists current behavior showing. He's allowing panic (and subsequent desire quell it) guide conversations.

When say expect vaccine work like vaccines regards coronaviridae important note coronavirus vaccines know approved humans would involve flu vaccines operate way I'm pointing out--they confer full immunity prevent transmission. think vaccine work like conclusion reach mine--we expect full immunity elimination transmission. work public health emergency response, here’s reasons didn’t call national guard assistance community testing first time: cost, used PPE due regulations, wouldn’t/couldn’t certain tasks, they’re trained record patient information, etc.

If you’re interested totally go detail issues make national guard unrealistic choice challenges conventional staffing. It’s complex topic many people expect. No. researched read could back Jan Feb 2020 prepare this. may misunderstood. I’m talking severe deadly competed - I’m talking sheer number people moving around compared time history. *which* countries record deaths lakhs? opposed wan, myriad, crore? It’s INSANE people advocating young “essential” (non-medical) workers get vaccinated elderly essential workers disproportionately minorities. 

Do know many black elderly people died goddamn virus? 

They woke pretzel logic. people show handle, ones turn away gonna pissed. raised hopes dashed them, wasted time boot.

We need stop treating Americans like children. explain people say look, guaranteed 500 doses, may able stretch 550. number 510. either wait leave. wait get vaccine today, give ticket go top line tomorrow. 

And regular dude internet, someone thinks vaccine distribution. Surely someone local government come something better. Thanks! wonder teachers high risk, research I’ve seen says kids half likely contract spread COVID? Or, I'm hoping, even fewer attend solidarity stupid decision CPS. Good luck firing literally half city's public school teachers finding replacements standards! would started. Look numbers Illinois, try make sense that.

No Thanksgiving bump, nothing. weird. Common folk wear surgical/medical mask only. now, N95 hospital taiwan. 
N95 better protection normal medical mask, necessary normal life land without local transmission. 
(Sadly record stop several days ago.) really hope pulls it.  Yes, part problem. Scarier sounding headlines get upvotes, hence clicks. predictions death counts I've seen especially frustrating since seems like consistently way off, still used determine new policies justify past policies. Mmm starting article comparing horror movie. Yes. Spicy, riveting journalism hahah see 40% defiance, know can't fired therefore worry losing jobs unless School Board starts making concessions tend reserve N95s pros. They’re available days it’s surgical masks general public. they’re worn enough people-high coverage key- they’ll help preventing onward spread. 

We’ve turned masks art form-you get boring blues greens via NHI card, sorts cute prints market; fluorescent new year fireworks print etc. hope said bar, beer hand, mask. first tragedy - losing control pandemic. second tragedy - vaccine rollout. Don’t know downvoted. don’t get dd214 out. Keep going. look skulls people made transition agriculture, bonkers, teeth every way, people stayed nomadic perfect chompers. Come California state mismanaged stockpile 1.4 Million doses mainly sitting warehouses. Less 400,000 administered. remember said thing 92. Let’s hope wrong time.  Spain something like making available employers. usually support naming shaming, wealthy people cut line named shamed. government told so? Nice beginning outbreak, concerns due shortages surgical masks uncertainty pandemic.
People basically wore whatever better fully exposed.
There lots videos online teaching people make masks CDC gave lots information regarding proper use reuse masks necessary.
The government helped lot ramping production rationing supplies. Nowadays get pack surgical masks 7-11's drugstores 5 pieces 1USD. Oh, surprise... Haha, love US 3 weeks first reported China, around time South Korea. taken. Seriously Trump still celebrating new trade deal China. Possibly, new vaccines approved would likely go faster can’t win... Well people go willingly donate one kidneys part liver. saves lives all!!!!!! insight declining it? absolutely baffles me. There's 2 members countries far China way China, visa yet approved Chinese government. think maybe travel restrictions due new strains virus 2 members get visa approved yet. However, far sensational clickbait headline ""block team"". Honestly huge amount responsibility lies Boris Johnson’s shoulders. 

The November lockdown called far earlier. Either September October. called 4 weeks ended three weeks everyone could run shops boost economy Christmas. 

And knew mutant strain that’s far contagious building momentum. figures going get higher higher now. 

The rules stricter. Mask usage enforced. I’m tired strict looking girlfriend seeing coughing people walking around supermarkets without masks. telling animal doctors places? Haha okay Even may two weeks work starts make impact. Yes, know, either. knows states tell feds, tell week. states know hospitals report. There's two lags built in. coverage different variants, almost one paying attention recently, makes wonder would reacting current surges know variants. assume would assume UK, South Africa, countries lost control COVID fatigue holidays. may still true. 

Expert commentary threading difficult needle, they're trying make people scared enough take precautions scared they'll conclude vaccines useless. good attitudes (take precautions vaccination, vaccine work) given expert track records last year I'm optimistic backfire well.

Worst-case scenario coverage new variants makes people *less* inclined take precautions decide vaccine work. 💖 Tell what? effective solution preventing wealthy/connected people jumping line?

No one saying good thing. going keep happening better focus getting distribution pipeline running efficiently. Even 800-2000 per day laughably inadequate. months. Imagine state vote national elections 2000 votes time?

It seems like everyone acting like vaccine complete surprise. sure could spun distribution locations months ago. want life back, take back much can. unpopular opinion sub point clear covid indeed fatal, small subset population. young, risks slim, even though risks. Yes, might transmit virus, that's live with. However asymptomatic transmission is, per science, much concern originally thought. Therefore might fair go suggest treat virus like other: symptoms, stay home quarantine. don't, live life.

This **not** advice I'd giving anyone 5-or-so months ago, point data upon data harms lockdowns harms covid. Lockdowns sustainable, covid deadliest virus earth, deadly some. Know who's risk stay away think exposed. Otherwise, take care mental health things make life worth living. Nobody possibly expected go living like much longer. fine yesterday, today nurse called say cyanotic struggling breathe. oxygen looking good. doctor think going survive long. Haha pardon friend? I’m confused mean can’t say originated testing.

Well, can't really say either. mean cares, mutation happen basically anywhere world. Lose home lose life. Super easy choice - lose home. buy another home road, can’t buy another life.  Ridiculous Need mass vaccinations keep social distancing 2021. depends dependent not. parents claim you, still get check! go IRS page fill form it, tax credit tax return. dependent parents, means pay majority expenses assumption parents pay food housing. parents claim dependent provide majority food housing, claiming dependent one.  Lmao think immunology virology communities would love hear able figure data we’re going forever pandemic social distancing heat death universe did. Hope feel generous enough share insights. anyone show waste hours time standby potential vaccine shot? 

Really? many friends little going lives? I’m sorry hear going this.

I 100% agree saying I’d say least 8 months now. It’s long-tail could completely disrupt healthcare health insurance... huge domino effect across literally industries people’s reduced ability work. I’ve read many cannot work longer, kids take care of. It’s sad.

Please take care yourself. Wishing absolute best. Ok saying possibility people taking vaccine getting immune response enough eliminate symptoms, thing studies look at, still leave amount virus active?

This possible/plausible guess goes know vaccines work. mRNA different way stimulating/educating immune system immune system still works.

If look comments Fauci others linked clear way think virus transmitted vaccination/immunization somehow present body attacked immune system. Covid new virus coronavirus completely unknown. Response vaccine similar coronaviruses reasonable assumption. different UK strain week two ago? Religion main reason people uneducated. everyone know tells fake stories forcibly indoctrinates young age, bound believe facts based entirely evidence. able believe fake people thousands years ago still understanding science, far compared masses zealots. head Operation Warp Speed expects AstraZeneca vaccine approved April US. wtf kinda logic this?? absolutely fucking matter. jesus. tell vulnerable people vaccinated right going die coming months covid. worse part don’t think eye storm yet. think see days 50-60,000 cases next week. untenable position in. Imagine living biggest rock... lol @ ya'll downvoting false though sensible policy.

It's typical Reddit double standards. election, Republican politicians favor opening schools (rightly) shit constantly site, Democrats favor thing, tune changed. cute. can't even store material properly, let alone allocate it. 

It's going long mass immunization starts. know better experts. Therefore, read primary source material vaccine trials themselves, listen statements reviewers submitted journal articles, read statements voting members FDA approved vaccine emergency use.

I interact social media no, pay attention posts social media benefit speaking experts directly...some share voting position university's IRB.

Whether understand well think irrelevant fact definitely understand better think do. Good job everyone! seems logical delivery NYC distribution NYC hospitals would easier anywhere else country, abysmal job it. 

I guess high hopes considering governor jerks every night amazing job done covid. Likely not. Vaccines induce broad immune response shouldn’t fully negated new strains.

Frankly, current speed vaccine rollout likely hinderance normalcy. longer covid spreads uncontrollably (especially transmissible variants), death potentially concerning mutations like Manaus thing all, whether South African strain (and strain responsible that) one. herd immunity threshold really ....things make shake head ....ummmmmm  wise?

did skip class taught Capitalism 101 ? good news vaccines help new variant sounds it? 

If race time countries declared war time measure force industry help manufacture vaccine manufacture it? 

We need war time rollout vaccines asap we'll chasing tails long time. Me, too. guys already wearing masks still acting stupid? Tots pears! Taiwan, example, tourism 5% GDP. GDP growth 2-3% (which somewhat typical), could get back previous economic size two years tourism industry ceases exist. Hello everyone, forgive silly question chances becoming infected indoor environment people masked? 
I getting car serviced dealership everyone wore masks wore incorrectly (with nose out). waited away everyone away precaution. would chance getting infected? I’m thinking low I’m paranoid getting Covid Wait, *the* Florida? Jesus Moderna measured 80-90% efficacy single dose sample size 2000. Pfizer probably way effective 52% one dose since number includes people infected within days getting first vaccine, case getting second dose irrelevant.

We're letting perfect enemy good. 95% efficacy great hospitals sitting doses even employees refusing get. conspiracy theory fodder. 

Any investigation, even starting one, going take years. journalists expect done deal not, must ""conspiracy"".

Even investigations start now, years anything released, even then, possible find nothing conclusive. Arrest man


...wait... 36 deaths day past week

i note worldometers.info reports 12 deaths/day latest 7-day moving average. Got called jury duty thankfully never got called in. Crazy Aww. I'm sorry guys. stepson grade 12 feel you. fun stuff senior year different nonexistent. *hugs* us old farts thinking disagree. Age based. Age based. Age based. There's reason can't qualifications without complicated ones currently exist. Taiwan higher per capita GDP US. Singapore. Third world ass. second story I've read COVID vaccine tampering. first pharmacist. gets me, someone dedicated life career, would risk everything act like this.

It seem like terrible act, but... Hear out.
I think people need platform speak explaining led making decisions. would interested hearing that, seem like motivations feuled greed. Unfortunately know major platform would allow thing. Maybe need get reddit like s/askreddit Well, comes China often China guilty proven innocent. China still guilty people really look evidence. fuck China China. Sweden reports deaths big lag, goes back time add them. doesnt report last 3-4 days, goes back report d-15 d-5, last 10days always missing.

Thats always seems flattened personally confirmed this. 
Do ; pick deaths 5 days ago, keep screenshot, recheck 10days. Can't Webex something? bonus check, I'm putting swimming pool! Maybe pampered US military fought harder put lives risk wars would’ve them? I'm thinking way are; rich behind it. know? would homo sapiens running cliff overpopulation control environmental destruction feedback loops *at time computers robots getting good enough make large swaths humanity ""redundant.""* strain US now. UK seeing kids sick snd hospitalized strain well.  

They need get vaccines going! Imagine cheering government suspending right trial jury state emergency. teachers? people come contact kids teachers. kids' relatives. Hmmm wonder 🤔 ""The South Africa variant concerning right appear may obviate medical countermeasures, **particularly antibody drugs**""

Still would like get Operation Warp Speed's director supply production distribution Ret. Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told host Shepard Smith Dec. 3 *everyone wants vaccine able get one June*. **Projections currently falling short, however. 17 million Covid doses distributed states, 4.8 million Americans received first shot according the Centers Disease Control Prevention.**

Look around, tell handle till June (at best) pace. Thanks link! I've hardily seen anyone wear KN95/N95 masks. people wear medical/surgical masks. Significant, yes, 100%. buckle seat belt still would upset deliberately rammed car it. Waiting india join competition... Auto-mod blocking [all sites reporting pretty good development Senior officials working White House coronavirus task force Operation Warp Speed pushing states begin handing excess COVID-19 vaccine doses whoever wants it, according four individuals familiar plan already motion, federal officials already talking states it. enacted, shift distribution could upend months debate strategizing get vaccine first. officials argue first-come, first-served approach may one ways ensure millions vaccine doses don’t expire shelf. far, 24 million doses allocated states, roughly 28 percent doses administered. virus mutate number ways, random however hypotheses explain various strategies viruses. predictable course however several hypotheses explaining selection virulence based pandemics past. Genetic mutation virus may random however selection tends follow trends. 

You may say parroting one theory explaining virulence spread based evolution selection. You’ve gotta think big catch big scandal. I've heard tales told Times... Sure, I’ll listen. Come closer get full signal wifi... damn wasnt 1,2 mil like 3 weeks ago? that's slow fuck Yeah no. wrong. friends kid almost died DKA waiting 20+ hours bed. Things ain’t fine. 
Wave1 highest peak Apr 17 98 per day. Wave2 peaked 76 per day Dec 18 .. heading ever since .. today 's 7-day moving avg 12 deaths per day.

source: I’m understanding level confidence here. cost system alone crazy. Plus would prevent contaminated air contaminating anyone got air return? would know it’s successful? would control be? clue many 30-person concerts would needed exposure infection. sounds like “trial” “let’s try see anyone gets sick. No? Well worked!” Seems like really great guy. always liked show. able to. There's large areas world looking well 2022 2023 get enough vaccine. there's escape mutation, production needs ramped *that* vaccine, parallel current/previous vaccines created large enough quantities disseminate world. would multi-year project *every time* there's escape mutation. CA appears worst terms covid cases hospital capacity currently. But, also consistently among strictest covid restrictions US. went wrong? OP, that's story says. story says ran visa issues; meaning ran immigration bureaucracy. 

If travelled countries require visa, even go regularly, often crapshoot whether get it; sometimes end waiting another country approval.

It looks like expecting granted special visa; seem case. constitute ""blocking access"". We’re f*cked isn’t case, huh? 🤣🤣😅😓 Meh, really hours. Moderna still refrigerated 30 days stable un-opened room temp 12 hours. I'm sure even special freezer broke, could've refrigerated it. doubtful, thought. right they'd closed months

Oh sure, talking Fore. think Texas shut DMV offices number weeks (but many) last spring well. Can't tweak people who've already vaccinated though, billions dollars many years fabricate disseminate vaccine...every time there's escape mutation. It’s definitely getting rough here. pretty different, use live fodder sometimes. think tier system necessary prevent mad rush chaos.

I feel like draft style lottery go get vaccine - birthday/SSN related lottery that's drawn week national TV paper distributed nationwide. prevent mad rush - number called schedule appointment go get vaccinated. Michigan Big-house set 2k shots per day - doubt could ramp capacity there. bet could MSU, CMU, Wayne State given medical schools large medical complexes area.  Fortunately jury duty kind suspended unofficially am. received notice selected serve, they’re bringing cases in, didn’t go. Apparently still counts served though, I’m good next time right. virus mutates fast able reproduce effectively.

But SARS-CoV-2 can't happen. There's already successful version stable infectious enough spread. point get better (so probably worse us), worse version die out. I've exposed covid handful times work, policy someone gets covid, choose tell everyone come back quarantined 2 weeks. director operation warp speed really care people outside China think. need make sure citizens think they're suspicion, allowing foreign investigators would tantamount admitting doubt world stage something relating virus origin connection Wuhan.

Not saying there's nothing find (there well might be), likely stuff going too. basically pointless. article literally says **may** obviate **some** drugs, stressing vaccinations response creates inference don’t obviate vaccines. Jesus, people love doom. mask protects everyone around you, everyone wearing mask, protected one individually respective masks. Dual shot, ten total visits including initial appointment. counting tens thousands already participated vaccine trials going since June.

This vaccine authorized months ago vulnerable patients. Would've saved quite lives. don’t disagree believe adjust vaccines necessary, article talking treatment covid patients certain antibody treatments may effective. people can't even get vaccine. almost like bragging point. telling afraid vaccine able get another year least? many americans care asian countries... mean shit americans ... Russia, say? aware Russian court system like U.S. one, even non-pandemic times main reason prevent spread. late 😕 like optimism, keep spreading love Thank nuanced take! Really appreciate it. 

My husband’s grandma actually got Moderna vaccine yesterday means she’ll fully vaccinated May, obviously, excitedly told husband, “oooh, means invite her!!!”. realized it’s physical aspect inoculated, fact lot people hiding going feel skittish general public re-emerge world, regardless safe actually are. I’m totally cool mask wearing, know won’t mask police drinks get going, people take masks really wants wearing masks outing pleasure. again, I’m pretty hopeful go long parents safely there. Thanks again.  medical experiment populace without informed consent wholly immoral. It’s also immoral vaccinate effectively. They’re going theater instead immunity make stuff open back up. I'm sure easier us learn Mandarin. one slaughtered Tiananmen, disgusted accusation enjoy violence. dare you.

This case media told us major story true. *That's* what's interesting.

Goebbels (Nazi Germany's propaganda chief) used talk Big Lie. said, ""If tell lie big enough keep repeating it, people eventually come believe it."" right.

Tiananmen one biggest stories '80s. lies come bigger?

Even now, bet thinking ""the Tiananmen Massacre must true -- one would tell lie big."" did. Adventist staff turned instead local community, 600 shots remaining... hospital staff blasted text employees letting people know anyone showed could shot. “We wanted make sure none goes waste,” Winiger said. 

Honestly first thought sounds suspicious... seems like perfect play whoever charge administering vaccines hospital wanted get vaccines personal connections -- others corruption jump line (and also praised response!). bet know reached family/friends/etc. first... admittedly evidence this, course, really would really easy verify based got vaccinated batch. start seeing cases freezers breaking, I'd definitely suspect shenanigans, assuming people actually care vaccination priority.

That said, maybe overall bad thing either long people getting vaccine, also clearly highlights failures vaccination rollout. Certainly current state vaccines sit around unused (thanks prescription vaccination priority) good thing either... someone already got Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine. Annoying pain 2 days injection site felt like arm got hit bat. way...yeah. different Full face respirator Viruses want anything. reproduce.  life lol. correct, possible lethal strains. usually tradeoff shedding virus virus persist reproduce needs new hosts.  getting nature vs nurture also big dogma biology however typically tradeoff.

Trashy disgusting! Wait, really PB club?! agree smarter. Call number, register get selection dates times 15 minute windows. Make cell phone number place get COVID Vaccine code show right place, right time show code get shot.

Putting people line pandemic pretty dumb. So... less Benghazi? Whoa, holup buddy. You’re playing fire criticizing teachers union. Shheeesh. Lot doom gloom thread. headline reads “may cause”. seen yet probably won’t. Vaccines hold. need vigilant bit longer. Stay home, mask can’t. tell - stop drinking life simple writing internet comment, pandemic would (or would never happened). Every change drug requires thorough testing make sure adverse effect population. Particularly, high-risk group who're susceptible pandemic. takes quite time results would rarely always success. taking consideration manufacturing distribution commenter pointed out.  Honestly expect anything else realize it’s theoretically possible one entity possible problem, right? LA hundreds thousands doses vaccine still sitting shelf.

Unbelievable. people family high risk cannot get vaccinated fuck bullshit attitude. That’s fuckers continue get away shit. shitty, pathetic apathy. Dang time prepare sense 1 million summer? isn’t game me, parents high risk one getting doses vaccine other. We’ve come terms it. Yes, side tries get jury favorable side. supported law side given preemptory strikes (not strikes cause). courts allowed qualified jurors, one would given preemptory strikes. statutorily granted. I’m going argue voir dire doesn’t suck. does. I’d happy pick whomever. guarantee made people blindly pick, cases would come back appeal we’d everything again. Ok last time went court shitty area. Also I’m gonna walk around cold winter court system wastes day. making sure understanding correctly. Thwack you. Lol nice spin 5 Oh god, he’s awful many levels. Thanks tip. Im already assuming 1% got already might swamped leading race vaccination? What’s daily injection? Basically: variant spreads like wildfire, latest surveillance figures scary hell. perhaps expect R +0.5 whatever, almost unstoppable.

Only good news lot increase young, mostly health effects. It'll move age brackets old fairly quickly, month (cross fingers) least one dose. thank heavens ""right work""! Imagine parents comorbidities. 

You could vaccinate one reserve second dose one, one get it.

Or could vaccinate two doses. 

Which choose? know lot people strong feelings one way another already done paramedics handle cardiac arrest, improved outcome transporting pt aystole, dangerous crew. guess engine commerce keep turning, matter many people die wheels... :( Antibody drugs vaccines think we’ve seen holidays whole many people family want see them, even people happy excuse smaller family gatherings going home laws

And someone points higher thanksgiving numbers: death rate increase rate change increase pre thanksgiving

Edit: house sort happy excuse see 12 people don’t particularly feel close besides tradition. much nicer time uncle grandfather. seen us well  Dick Cheney, you? thinking state legislatures governor could make changes judges.

Basically judges limit jurys jury selection procedurally cant change substantively  No, hear loud clear. saying unavoidable Australia position UK terms population would similar boat whilst saying Australia made decisions UK did, we'd similar boat UK.

The development second strain result failure suppress virus cause it.

You accept plenty measures UK taking taken yet claiming thing left martial law point. “Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned vaccinating Americans Covid critical ever, especially new South Africa variant appears inhibit antibody drugs.”

“Gottlieb cited experimental evidence Bloom Lab, explained 501.V2 appear partially escape prior immunity. means antibodies people produce get infected Covid, well antibody drugs, may quite effective.” Hey man, good job taking back though! easy. 🏆  prior experience SARS well familiar dealing bush meat.  yeah insurance pay it? 9 months plan best they've come with. finally. Yeah courts fucked media clearly framing California death spiral without objective basis it.

I’ve got international minutes phone plan relatives overseas.

You send private message.  Envy optimism PA weird state. guys swing heavily leadership mostly republican. Republicans PA also conservative, they're like Kentucky Alabama conservative. They're true Republicans believe core republican principles use Party science. True Republicans still believe science core values like business. guys blue id certainly believe almost online schooling, true Republicans understand business economy saying years election day needs federal holiday people voting they're missing money, people miss money they're spending economy thriving. applies this, babysitting hard find illegal places. Missing work kids money issue them. 

One thing admire dang republicans, know something. much I'm fan policies, admit they're way better implementing policies.


Otherside; Republicans repeating rhetoric online Covid disinformation worlds, especially middle America. likelihood outbreak might far worse. know political thread, issue political. virus stop teaching laws do. Mulder taught anything it’s trust one excellent movie!! depends jurisdiction. Sure, could change wanted to. That's informative thanks. asthma tests inhaler/peak flow meter doctor said asthma... never asthma life. 
I still use inhaler sometimes feel really bad help time...

I think shortness breath comes lunges throat... Basically want get big inspiration blocking throat (from trachea think) air coming (it's like long run cannot catch breath...)
And blocking end needing inspire air much still blocking time get breathless... vicious cercle.

I recap doctors breathing test said find anything probably refer throat specialist. related opinions 

I’m good boy sound like Florida Man Thank everything do. family high risk varying states lockdown since last March, soon got wind it. see you, appreciate you. plan would replacing people trained so. don’t have. don’t even enough nurses is. aren’t loads people lining jobs aren’t available 

You can’t fire people taking vaccine isn’t even fully approved FDA

And coming someone scheduled take it. I’m anti vax anything Why, wet market originated back open.  I'm sure could walk talk vendors. mean get softer waiting entire year investigating? still getting blocked. becomes norm everywhere, won’t dying people streets. Well, be, covid.

While don’t think it’s likely outcome there’s not-so-crazy risk proper breakdown society shit. grounds lawsuit? Negligence best, willful endangerment. ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

hey.

simply great? trying say? :\] 

you disappeared thought forgone whole last word thing say 350000 dead people would disagree you. percentages serious debilitating conditions course many months (""long covid"")? even die, could still completely destroy health change life, maybe entire remainder.

I certainly want risk stuck wheelchair, unable taste food smell anything... 6 months postponement, 1 year, excused jury duty. get either. Anxiety, guess. agree. Fuck Newsom Garcetti. mall thing pisses much. hell century city open?? 

Further, people meeting friends inside!! miles miles beaches, go picnic something instead!

Ugh city Oonga boonga savage  flu contagious COVID. existing antibodies disease like flu. Freedom free, WWII Americans rationing cards accepted sacrifice make welfare nation. time around asked wear mask social distance. something impacts individuals based choice. dumbass like catch it, carry it, spread innocent people essential areas like grocery store doctor's office. fucking problem. 

Even whole thing somehow big global hoax I'll sleep hell lot better night knowing made small sacrifices help fellow man instead kicking fuss mUh fReEdUmBs Every day feel like Ferrell's character Zoolander, situation continues deteriorate many people give shit

 France appealed antivaxxers. Patients consulted prior vaccination given time reflect decision. They're spending time talking bunch nonsense actually giving jab out.

This means doctors nurses may visit care home multiple times vaccinate people despite fact could done less day. never turned, team showed china without visas. Like wtf expect happen. left china without verifying documentation went through, specifically stated went hoped could sort got there. fucking amateur hour right now, understand basic Visa policies Texas also internet videogames. Imagine locked year nothing do. also applies random anecdotes covid symptoms basis research

We’ve lost many fundamental understandings capita, frequency win pandemic Ambulances transport corpses. 12 jurors required law? Federal law requires 6.

US, politics + election science went jaw wired shut haven’t called back. 10 years ago rumours flying every day ""THIS NURSE/DOCTOR/ETC GOT VACCINE DIED WEEK LATER!!!111"" feel like [this article Derek must broadcast entire world. important take 10 million people wave hand back forth upper arms, next two months would expect see 4,000 heart attacks. 4,000 strokes. 9,000 new diagnoses cancer. 14,000 ten million die, usual all-causes mortality. one would notice. That’s many people die get sick took ten million people gave new vaccine instead, there’s real danger heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, deaths attributed vaccine. mean, reach large enough population, literally going cases someone gets vaccine drops dead next day (just would didn’t get vaccine) mutants emerge they’ll evolve gradually

This part pure speculation.

That assumption going mess early last year since disproven rapid evolution multiple variants--some showing multiple mutations protein spike.

No one, even Fauci, predicted we'd rapid jumping species. take *years* often occurs *never*. COVID took months...*months.*

In case, write erased it. get impression interested constructive dialog.

The bottom line even Fauci stated back August harbinger things come. fully expects us pandemics, frequently, less moving forward.

You've said current pandemic somehow moving toward end experts indicating us we're even seeing end beginning. live interconnected world 1918 virus transmissible flu one took three years abate. We're year *one.* likely originated China, fact. fact idea patient zero. Anything beyond speculation. look glorious leader, got obviously learn shit. think expect much people... Yeah turns people don’t get dick hard old people dying. Sorry you’re psychopath iirc 65% elderly population. Moderna also loses efficiency elderly (90% instead general 95%). Pfizer shown consistent 95% elderly too.

But AZ used vaccinate (younger) frontline workers reserve others elderly. also less densely populated leader gave shit. It’s harder sounds,

Reading rest graf, yeah say know least 2 judges died covid several lawyers.

Damn, man. condolences Singapore one four countries ~50% higher GDP/capita US. Taiwan ~15% lower right next Germany. depends local restrictions. think places different rules vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people point. used current pres name verb...it fact verb.

Like, fuck?! people even fucking real!? *real* jobs!? Extremely small. Nearly experts agree schools think thats bad manager thought would good idea come work daughter got sick wife tested positive. left time wore mask. pray catch shit. Texas ass backwards comes people following simple instructions passing periods.

The hallways bigger problem.

Schools dont different times let students out. let everyone boom kids everywhere packed inside tight spaces.

Youd need different times passing periods reduce exposure. hallways arent always jam packed students

Low risk risk. That’s error logic. Fewer young people may die COVID, fewer may suffer long term damage, low number mean “zero” one knows holds short straw... someone always does.  Look shocked face... Oh, sustainable right. What's sustainable *us.* 

Today's (Jan 5th) vaccination update:

I hate it, since abhorrent working conditions going happen anyway, better local self sufficient.

I'm curious say full year. I'm assuming COVID January February last year, ever get confirmed? thought last year January obviously US tests yet. 

Also symptoms hampering quality life? assume national guard nurses already employed regular nurses anyway. Bahahahana.

Seriously fucked up. dont resources money deal shit “leaders” would rather watch us die instead taxing rich fund healthcare systems every first world country has. should. think spike protein they're targeting vaccine changing much. topic pondering while. wish break Reddit's rules hope comment/question ask that!

The question origin Virus clearly something would like investigate. two choices continually quoted world press either originated Wet Markets (animals) manufactured laboratory.

Even answer latter, mean released intentionally. question needs investigated authorities confident man-made laboratory.

Let's say WHO's investigation concluded virus originated laboratory. Whether released accidentally otherwise, **my question this.**

What would/could ""world"" result would,

1. Provide sufficient satisfaction countries affected, and
2. Limit likelihood ever happening again?

If powerful nation chose go path again, suspect answer questions would **NOTHING!** vaccinated go eat inside restaurant? I’ve pondering day, wish knew efficacy numbers: percentage transported patients would survived? 20%? 5%? that’s 20 people, 5, wouldn’t died normal times, they’re going now.

I don’t mind journalists calling shit right now, want cuomo style threats huge fines somehow certain vaccines get distributed wrong order.

And arent anywhere near close done this.


So yeah, lifetime thing. Presumably feels won’t sufficient. doesn’t address vaccinations article linked. fly here. last time called (two years ago) appear summons, guy tried everything possibly could weasel judge put ringer. think they'd tell anyone mentioned shirt they'd jail contempt wore anything like that.

Remember Trump said would give $10k UPS guy stopped kids burning flag?

He rewarding certain kind behavior. clearly worked, supporters really willing get violent protect see important. need thing, behavior encourages vaccination. maybe without violence.

I know big bad thing rich people scrambling get vaccine, especially caught like this. makes vaccination aspirational, increasing demand.

It's like potatoes France (seriously): Cherry picking stats science Screwed. Every day bad news. 2021 far shit I’m aware excused legitimate reasons. OP made sound like called said “nah ain’t coming in”. excusal approved never specified was. Yea, let’s thank banning wet markets SARS letting us get mess first place. /s

Not surprise post history pro-socialism pro Xi.

At beginning pandemic still allowed many people leave country.

Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam dealt best external virus wasn’t formed territories. Australia also done really well. haven’t community transmission 8 months. judgement, course, introverted love staying home - imagine somehow cure Covid nightly bar meet-ups friends-of-friends. That's extroverts feel lockdowns.

Exactly. Imagine stayed home whole life loved it, throughout 2020 spend every single day party strangers. dying end, too. consider almost anything get back normal. And? strive goal? vaccines rolling proper protections place makes sense. well looks like getting former since lattet going slow mud excess vaccine hospital even within hospital workers reluctance BULLSHIT reading online. 

There tax credit taking vaccine. happens governments world claim masks work months end. Sometimes hard reverse lies. 


I've heard claims shortages cause, however that's claimed greatly influenced many thought masks effectiveness. know theres real idiots weve known dangers thing mutates has, well might looking results now. Let Florida give rich people. let tiers get way optimistic thinking, especially south african mutation.  I'm sure time UK variant discovered already spread across globe.  Well estimate.

We know overly optimistic inaccurate been. He's saying summer... also said would worst pandemic January, without vaccine would coming close, nearing herd immunity — but, facing worst month yet. Maybe California set aside 100,000 doses give $25,000 donations. Stick $2.5 billion small businesses struggling residents?  one major states (link detailed data)

Karnataka state,todays data

Cases - 784

Death - 6

Tests - 134,173 ( 123,037 RT PCR rest 3 kids 3 different locations (Kindergarten, 1-4th grade ""Gymnasium"" (High school)) time. sure fire way contract virus going around. Even good spreading.

Before kids could never understand folks sick often. Turns parents mostly scene London lockdown. People scrambling escape, process, spread UK strain far wider have. know covid December, UK government prevent people leaving? Exactly Spain, except locked yet (in spite per capita cases Germany). rest first paragraph could apply verbatim. 

And one charge seems understand exponentials (at least Merkel does).
 
I hope countries good luck. need it. That's April. misinformation. Hospitals lost lot business summer due postponing elective procedures. Almost healthcare workers individual thinkers share hivemind. 

It still boggles Redditors like one think people profession/gender/race monolithic opinion issues. Nay. I'm arguing people treating COVID anyone comes within fifty feet COVID facility get shot. I'm arguing different group workers get it, I'm arguing rollout relies determining work for/what field (which harder establish) complicated one relies purely age (which assess via ID, failing that.. visually). I'm arguing point shark gets jumped ""need protect fighting COVID"" ""need ensure health business entire labor force site including people whose job make powerpoints day."" time rollout painfully slow plenty vulnerable elders still vaccinated, elders European countries able get jabbed... 

I live hospital administrator (who actually one got wound this), yes get ICU money losing business. Especially treating uninsured Medicare patients. Sucks business arm hospital. know, like sucks every business that's impacted this. cities like Shijiazhuang still lockdown. Numbers low there, it’s lockdown regardless. also country started releasing vaccine trials completed, didn’t ban wet markets previous virus outbreaks. Let’s pretend good Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam handled entire situation. Karnataka state,todays data

Cases - 784

Death - 6

Tests - 134,173 ( 123,037 RT PCR rest one accurate things I’ve read pandemic far it’s witty wish thought :) Turns invested public health better public health crisis. Whereas America we’re mercy private enterprise. probably look affluent. want $$$ New Zealand one countries hope Pandemic. Good luck telling sub *Cries British*  Clarifcation: 
Vaccine **could be** mandatory **and there** wear mask, fuck stick... Maybe missed part talked managing large manufacturer hundreds employees gotten sick... stupidity showing inability read. manufacturer also happen work provides medical supplies hospitals we're contact everyday doctors medical facility personnel... large metropolitan areas hear 20% people hospital covid reason hospitals overbooked they've pushing elective non-elective procedures they're swarming hospital waiting year put things like shoulder surgeries. 

Most doctors agree covid joke. Keep living echo chamber Reddit.

back March got argument guy covid statistics claimed would 6.5 million 9.5 million deaths Christmas (in US) estimated we'd 300 400k... people called stupid people called ignorant people called denier voted oblivion. degenerates keep changing goal post finding new metric concerned about. 

The truth people get sick, people get better minority die mostly already going die. disease kills 0.0019% people ages 0 35 concerning disease eyewitness also got arrested fined massively. nurse got fired shit. Yet, Egyptian Minister Health goes indoor wedding following day population says ok.

Egypt crisis. follows science... Also NJ. letter resignation prepared approach deadline return classroom. caretake immediate family immunocompromised told cannot continue teaching home despite fully functional... I'm told use FMLA use sick days, still required teach home due sub shortage.

I've simply decided that. district full-steams ahead unsafe manner, I'll little choice leave. I'm actually terrified health issues idea I'm going get without medical insurance. 

The political malfeasance US put rock hard place, three consequence either choice could life threatening. right. way could Americans politicians work together team anything, nevermind major event like once-in-a-century global pandemic. ? dont know Johnny Hopkins. Teachers also tested much higher rate often young DGAF. teachers spend weekends Disney traveled winter break. surprise teachers catching it. yet teacher actually catch school area entire semester. America, right receive covid vaccine (eventually) cost yourself. that's enough safety you, right stay home. Common sense. one honestly claim San Marino worst COVID response deaths-per-million 1825, vs USA's 1103.

Just FYI, San Marino's population 0.034M.

A single case death would skew smaller population's stats *way* proportion compared larger population, US world's 3rd populous country. UK Chief Medical Officer: Restrictions may added NEXT said really thought this, I’d probably get banned incivility. I’ll say “no, I’m following single restriction next winter”. realistic concern new variants increased transmissibility. best way combat get people vaccinated quickly possible. 

It extremely unlikely mutation coronavirus near future completely evades vaccines. worst case vaccines bit less effective mutations, 95% effective lots room become bit less effective still offer good protection. good discussion here: I'm sure I'll downvoted, trying persevere languages stupid. world needs less languages, more. inability people different backgrounds communicate massive driver misunderstanding eventually leads hate conflict. X leave house except once-weekly grocery store run walk outside anymore. seen parents except wave across lawn zoom since early fall, saw outside cases low area. take unpaid leave job molecular scientist coworkers would wear masks health condition. wearing mask filter CDC finally put releases safe.

The assholes wear masks actively impinging freedom people want live lives safety. think freedom freedom rebel anything someone asks do, child's notion freedom. 00's full performative patriots talking honor sacrifice. Americans fall bottom-of-the-barrel propaganda, still do.

Coming reading stories New Zealand genuinely gives hope. possible structure society around cooperation, mutual respect, federal coordination, trust science. committed sacrifice common good. trust country.

The comment replied wants China commended. Trump done enough damage significant % population believes masks conspiracy, leading incidents like this. PROTESTERS TRY FORCE WAY STORES CENTURY CITY MALL  
By Josh Haskell  
Monday, January 4, 2021 5:50PM PT

CENTURY CITY (KABC) -- Shoppers employees Century City mall Sunday became target anti-mask protesters forcefully spread message anyone wearing mask -- everyone mall masks required.

""We see protesters megaphones saying masks. Take masks. Open back L.A. lives matter,"" said Johnathan Cabrera works Century City Mall

Cabrera works store Untuckit locked doors prevent protesters coming inside, closed store early. Cabrera says shocked group 30 says he's rarely issues anti-maskers before.  

""I've guests come say 'I really want wear this,' always encourage safety, safety, please wear mask shopping store,"" said Cabrera.  

""They want spread awareness message masks, say masks ineffective COVID part broader conspiracy. Obviously, overwhelming scientific consensus contradicts that,"" said Samuel Braslow Beverly Hills Courier. 

Braslow, reporter Beverly Hills Courier, covered protest says group targeting Los Angeles stores past weeks, including chain super markets pharmacies. LAPD called mall, eyewitnesses tell us surprised protesters asked leave cited.  

The LAPD tells ABC7 role Sunday mall like protest: facilitate first amendment rights, keep peace, intervene unless necessary. almost though countries fucked up. That's I'm pointing out. Thats simple. reason everything. Money.
You know really expensive skiing lodge Aspen number houses spread across country friends right? mean, people power cater society closest personal needs.
It's everything formed last 40 years ultra capitalism, self-entitlement, valuing objects higher human lives. Moneyy unfortunately people.

True, really fully state government. responsibility federal government top down. consistent nation-wide response way effectively respond national, nation-wide crisis.  fact post praises quarantines testing, somehow forgets mention important measure, travel bans, tells they're trying inform, they're trying influence. assume healthcare workers know stuff like engineerings know our.

Hospitals slow innoculations...) entire extent Santa Clara’s page juror COVID policy shitty video wiping surfaces. show inside courtroom attorneys judge behind plexiglass, jurors sitting next normal, one seat empty (so 3 feet apart less). 

Somehow thought would make people comfortable serve? It’s awful. could? it’s virus... didn’t know that. Antibodies testing isn’t covid-19 coronavirus general? That's probably case parents afford private school private instruction. I'd risk kid (and myself) getting COVID alternative falling behind. gives fits thinking chasm inequity opened pandemic.  :)  really, really, really hope America this. criteria matter age.

Shit happens. tight knit community friends, family essential workers things like get taken care due community response. 

Proud Ukiah. informed essential work county. 

Deeply grateful family friends essential work able get vaccinated. 

Waste waste. time available better response. 

Just $0.02. Get pitchforks. get help “Lets seize assets jail people guilty wrongthink!”

This comment peak outraged Redditor. 330 million Americans? still year vaccinate us rate. New York alone expired doses people vaccinated insane idea hand $100k fines per person vaccinated anyone vaccinates without following priority guidelines exactly. Exactly.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* True. also true much easier build equipment supply oxygen train providers.

Not *easy* still talking medical device, easier. Decisive leadership, real war mobilization, would help kind thing.

The truth is, small medium businesses better job realigning production. Even without leadership. stillmasters made sanitizer, government rewarded tax bill.

But... chemical engineers, machinists, welders, toolmakers America needed PPE, medical supplies, relatively simple equipment like oxygen purification?

Seriously - *really strong* petrochemical industry US, thanks history subsidies. separate oxygen nitrogen everyday certainly people could figure make polygauze hazard suits gloves.

At least could got start. second best time plant tree soon realize need one.

But people manage industry? They're used handouts instead exercising leadership.

And laws too. Still books WWII. needed strategy, delegation, political will.

Instead party telling public panic - least senators short market positions. party whining moderation fair play. that’s logical fallacy still you’re wrong

it’s called evidence absence, look man   Fucking Texas...😑  !remindme 6 months

Hopefully you’re right ! intubating extubating patient I’m exposed much higher potential viral load staying home wearing mask social distancing outside.

Many patients COVID test 5 days old could positive.

There also risk false negative.

For emergent cases don’t get luxury COVID test.

We don’t luxury using full blown PPE like PAPR situations listed that’s need vaccine healthcare workers first.

If get sick there’s one run hospital.  short, caught jail jail didn’t fucking tell anyone test result positive, including him. what's point? Also need use username reply. I'll get reply regardless. Let meme NorCal folks best, especially Bay Area. SoCal folks, especially Orange County doesn’t give shit. Don’t machines convert air oxygen spot? Uncle doesn’t tote green tanks days, carries portable converter.  Santa Clara it’s 90 days. I’m scheduled appear early February I’m sure do. courts closed 1/19. Maybe they’ll stay closed I’d excused. defer end April see happens. Subconscious 4D chess ex treating like care life. sneaky itll hurt something. honesty hate never want shit like this. wants mysterious divorce. wanted go away. takes far gets infected covid. also sometimes feel like I'm abusing mad get. I'm sad. Thanks, mine kind vague that. plan report CDC’s v-safe tracker also, wonder I’ll hear anything that. u/johndrake666 read article. FDA thoroughly completely rejected ideas every point went far say proponents misinterpreted available data. stodgy scientific organization make kind statement nearly unheard of.  vernacular, said No! HELL NO! let door hit way out. denying variants exist. welcome post pre-print /r/COVID19 (if posted already). secondary reporting things, like CNN article, tends little alarmist, unfortunately. sounds like pretty elegant solution, assuming portal functional. know variety issues online assignments.

Surely physical attendance tied funding, thus schools incentivized want students stay home. Money makes world go round. work frozen food. 

While I'm glad could get vaccine administered viability period, please expect going one-time thing. people ideas could pandemic Fall. November 2021 probably earliest expect anything looks like ""normal"".

Frozen supply chains many weaknesses:

- Supplier issues (highly unlikely case)
- Transportation issues 
 - Trucks go down, generators powering refrigerator. Now, know much stored dry ice, dry ice lasts longer sealed, ambient air cooler
 - Parcels/pallets/etc get misloaded, damaged, messed-with transit. cooler breaks open CO2 sublimate quickly, even refrigerator outside on
-Dock issues
 - sure warehoused supplier destination, slap ""HIGH PRIORITY"" ""KEEP COLD"" even temperature tip indicators side items - people still occasionally mess up
 - Receiving points distribution mess up. truck comes vaccines, maybe 4th 5th shipment, manager excited make sure everything goes right. Jimmy underpaid worker second week job leaves pallet/cooler/whatever sun items get Walgreens special pharmacy freezer. 
 - Poorly organized points distribution mishandle vaccines - alarming it'll leave patients confident immunity may not. Think many offices able get dry ice easily rural-type locations, freezers go down. Decisions made try extend life vaccines, find vials stored breakroom freezers
 - General mishandling including damaged vials like

I'm confident rollout continue, robust timelines certain groups START receiving vaccines less adhered to, however, make mistake begin, rollout might slower expected. 

Couple number antivaxxers get it, children can't yet get it, add people immune systems allow get immunity (or they're allergic), idea we'll get herd immunity anytime soon becomes less less probable. try imagine government given companies experts money get started this. manufacturing company changing make costs money. hard company throw millions something might even get money from? companies would much higher unemployment rate. first wave, hospitalised tested UK, I'm guessing first wave skewed towards elderly. Here's could find. article November drugmakers set back challenge manufacturing enough doses keep demand, New Jersey's Johnson &amp; Johnson thought ahead. Leaning years experience, drugmaker well way producing 1 billion doses COVID-19 vaccine 2021 looking ahead 2022, said Paul Lefebvre, vice president strategic initiatives COVID-19 vaccine supply chain J&amp;J's Janssen unit, in interview.   one could predicted scope COVID-19 pandemic, J&amp;J systems place grapple unprecedented event—the crisis strategies, fact, it leveraged response Hurricane Maria 2017, Lefebvre said.

Separately, J&amp;J shipping 30 million doses crossed. Canadian it’s always weird see words “hospital” “business” one sentence 2 week lockdown. delay vaccination get immunity still get 2nd shot. Probably full immunity 6 weeks first shot. ""But kids spread virus!""

Making first airborn virus absolutely LOVE kids...

Seriously, normal year schools flu factories. like conversation almost anything like economic principles two specific people usually snide redditor makes comment. Either repeating thing anytime think might applicable.

You might notice first one mention Merica. kids schools live streaming time teaching person, work tests done via online portal students. middle high school works really well doesn’t force teachers two separate plans. Elementary know much difficult course. POINT? things true - people catch people die *SO WHAT*. change anything approach disease. Whatever. least people actually getting them!

I'm way past point caring pecking order. plan clearly failed. get vaccines arms. lot ""humans never hug shake hands again"" ""people never go stadium again"" comments going look really silly 12 months. Yep, exactly I've encountered well, except Albertson's. Yes puts perspective. Wish spent less military overall anyway. Thanks info! get fine: ""Other reports suggested nurse fined ‘not working hard times’"".
I egyptian, man fuck egyptian government. schools shitty job remote learners

Did schools terrible job kids bother work? I've seen both. know parents kids frustrated teachers giving enough work enough teaching, also know parent's whose kids simply anything. Um, heard flu vaccine?

I knew would use flu vaccine example.

My ""Everyone gets COVID vaccine, except legitimate medical waivers"" public policy works COVID mutate high rate like flu does. COVID slow mutator, eradicate vaccine makers adapt vaccine formula quickly COVID mutates. COVID fast mutator, stuck flu vaccine problem. case, everyone still get COVID booster shots every year, slow COVID mutation rate.
Honestly, know COVID fast slow mutator, know end with. However, still think everyone take vaccine either forced policies laws, put small societal bubble possible. single individuals want risk health thousands millions unscientific personal reasons, isolate them. US done option today. long term New Zealand would also failed vaccines never showed up. Bulgaria unlucky enought took year. Would safe use welding-grade oxygen? There's also huge rise testing. heat map first wave biased towards elderly testing primarily risk time, everybody get test. Kind confirms full shit “islamofascism.” 

Terrorists need/desire undermine America we’re stellar job lol. need giving mass vaccinations dying California knew vaccine coming yet nothing prepare.

you appreciate scope ""prepare""

&amp;#x200B;

NY started planning 

the *beginning* 

of *start* 

of *mass vaccinations*

&amp;#x200B;

**Javits Center, SUNY, CUNY COVID vaccination drive-thru weeks vax UK.

I suspect they're still collecting names volunteers.

and gathering materials they're going need.

(UK roughly 2x size CA)

&amp;#x200B;

do legitimately think 3 weeks enough time train tens thousands volunteers convert convention centers stadiums mass vax venues?

&amp;#x200B;

that's simply **unrealistic**.

&amp;#x200B;

Giants, Lakers, Clippers, A's, Dodgers, Angels, Sharks, Ducks, 9ers, Rams, Chargers parks ?

in 3 weeks?

&amp;#x200B;

**Covid vaccine: UK jab millions NHS recruiting **30,000 volunteers help rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff students - trained give jabs.** charity St John Ambulance asked assist. military also enlisted, help logistics building mass vaccination centres.

Armed forces already assisting set mass vaccination centres, ***Ashton Gate stadium Bristol. sites also prepared, example Leicester Epsom racecourses, Bath &amp; West Showground Etihad Campus Manchester.***

&amp;#x200B;

CDC venues consideration

&amp;#x200B;

**Guidance Planning Vaccination Clinics Held Satellite, Temporary, Off-Site purpose guidance assist jurisdictional planning implementation satellite, temporary, off-site vaccination clinics public private vaccination organizations. users may include public health preparedness professionals. guidance primarily focuses clinical considerations planning vaccination clinic, including vaccine storage, handling, administration, documentation. However, large-scale clinics, held arenas stadiums, held multiple days conducted emergency scenarios, likely require added logistical technical considerations. Consult state local public health preparedness office additional support.  guidance applies clinics open general public clinics targeted populations (i.e., critical workforce personnel and/or higher-risk priority groups). clinics may provisionally located walk-through sites (churches, community centers, outdoor tents) settings mobile, curbside, drive-through sites. Guidance applicable whether routine vaccination provided (i.e., back-to-school annual flu clinics) emergency vaccination provided preparedness scenario (i.e., pandemic influenza COVID-19 vaccination vaccine available). counter point, almost therapeutics vaccines - whether discovered academic university lab private lab - direct result government funding. 

It's kind odd system (taxpayers) fund research first place, take hit ones work out, ones successful, pay final product again. Exactly, old Covid still gonna Covid. People convinced hype reason never got rooted weather turned. Big olive oil always working behind scenes smh priority groups solving problem instead creating different problem. would describe priority groups working. optimistic little confused people wallowing bad news point deny existence good news vote anyone dares buck trend.

80% fatalities 15% population significant % population already exposed. need 300 million vaccinations make big difference probably like 25-30 million. think curves start drop pretty soon weeks.  need next time we'll infrastructure quickly make billion doses mRNA vaccines. live NJ concur. I'm Republican either, voted Biden, wanted Warren, thrilled Georgia. 

None changes fact Cuomo often completely full shit lot bluster. 

New York City's campaign regarding testing strikes insane - get tested. Get tested often. Get tested whether feel anything not. literally encouraging ""getting tested regularly"". 

Really? feel sick know near someone infected mostly locked down, wearing mask brief grocery trips, etc. Keep getting line thousands strangers week potentially spending hours within feet them? I'll take chances staying home getting tested regularly, since would seem place I'm constantly exposing long periods time strangers. mean ""same strangers"" viral load time spent near someone expelling virus matters. Passing people street masked grocery store standing line 90 minutes 2 hours two people might actually infected. Even mask, chances greater scenarios. 

So testing like 60K/day accomplished, administering doses properly cannot be? Yeaaa, really see big issue either.

The cost vaccine vs cost economic damage prolonged time nothing. Can't get charged can't breath. Went store husband bi weekly grocery hunt older fellow walking around Walmart mask glaring everyone challenging say something?????
Arizona right shit show getting worse. Thats bit fucked it? unconstitutional Australia. Californians come vacation Arizona zero restrictions. several VRBOs neighborhood, always full cars California plates. probably both. NZ 27% immigrant heard immigrants picking fruit. highly skilled wealthy immigrate NZ. fruit pickers temporary work visas, mostly backpackers. That’s exactly point!

The logistical bottleneck due cooling necessity priorissation groups huge problem.

We need vaccine distribute existing infrastructure - family doctors provided anybody wants one Dayyyuummm Pretty sure wording trash, they're contextualizing saying global death toll may compare population LA (\~4mil) things wind down. Given we're \~1.8mil officially reported deaths give take currently, probably somewhat conservative side estimations.

&amp;#x200B;

either really alleging 100% mortality rate conservative... hard tell internet sometimes. target 100 million shots 100 million people? always thought 100 million shots. 100 million people much better target. seems appropriate, dark winter.

Beyond March, beyond one full year, think becomes questionable whether really called temporary measures anymore. Mine says ""Access Denied"". News Taiwan I'm unbelievably jealous. I'm tired country sucking hard every important metric health human development. 3. current vaccines provide immunity comparable better infection. antibodies broader immune response compared infections, without potential hurt people.  Ya, think he's responsible distributing doses HCQ individual. worry devaluing dollar and/or inflation\

No, vaccine distribution budget 1% military budget. fair amount money, still tiny drop bucket compared overall spending - mention ROI huge. Nothing stimulate economy like individuals feel confident go back spend/earn money. Yes many people think damage heart, brain organs typical common outcome Covid. headlines report issues given indication frequency likelihood different respiratory illnesses viruses. dare even question anyone downvoted oblivion. I’m sorry, experience sounds horrible. experience parent California district much different. district online since March done amazing job providing computers, materials, etc children. Sadly it’s still enough young children they’re paying price. said, district put millions prepping schools return safety supplies, dividers, gear place. even secured enough funds set ensure staff students receive weekly testing. Oh teachers student remain online prefer. Still, that, haven’t able open due politics.

In reading response, think worst part horrible debate happening staff/children’s expense it’s happening national level, schools functioning state local level. don’t know federal government power, maybe Biden’s 100 day plan force schools like step response/safety efforts schools like mine open. can't exactly show certainty case, hypothesis strong reasoning that's impossible verify. Well almost everyone know changed theirs. stayed family. small gathering two three households rather large extended family ones. I'm BC (Canada) one lowest rates COVID North America. disciplined works. got forensics team swab site say. recall right found fragments, would expected known infected person worked there. Moderna, Pfizer, FDA &amp; state there's data

1. state there's enough data medium-term *efficacy*. made statement ethics morality getting people vaccinated sooner, they're ethicists. comment trial showed.

2. statements referring UK decision delay second dose 12 weeks. study looked delaying percentage doses maximum 6 weeks. bet using stuff made China capacity right now. I'd say people seem self selecting risk level. Among family friends seems risk groups especially males 55+ likely interested. Young people less so. local theater chain advocating wear mask seated kids school allows person virtual- teacher teaches classes time. work done via portal either student access (also teachers don’t touch paperwork). It’s worked really really well. 

The reason districts wouldn’t something similar want force kids physically go back. It’s bullshit. unconstitutional implement hard border crossing NYC rest country. Guess would apply European countries well. Sure, example nearly flu deaths Germany year. 

Sadly, statistics hand apparently, year's data flu Germany quite unreliable. least company's data say huge drop sick days year, especially flu/cold season. 

So probably measures worked SARS-CoV-2 also worked respiratory diseases.

Flu deaths alone reach couple thousand deaths per year, alone might even additional Covid-19 deaths. 

I already see Germans complaining next year Covid-19 bad really deaths years... think meant amount deaths roughly equals population LA, I'm sure Archived link: see people one post negative stuff, report get suspended/banned fucked, trying hard follow rules so... demoralized.

Nothing working. LA culture suicidal point. Oh confident plenty people saying shouldnt get all. far pretty sure people asymptomatic never get symptoms (as opposed ""pre-symptomatic"") good spreading virus.

The current vaccines good job prevent symptomatic infection, follow least, people vaccinated spread virus much. evidence studies animals indicates happen all, studies humans while. also remember started, waiting special snowflake come back too. No, test post mortem Japan. parts world think everything threat freedoms. 

Nah, feeling threat feeling entitlement.

Narcissism often sugar-coated descriptors like ""strong-willed"", ""individual-minded"", ""freedom-loving"" duck? nature science dealing issue. Bless you. love appreciate you. Stay strong. fascist right word. totalitarian might better word. people often link nazi germany fascistic totalitarian, linked. Jan 6 (Reuters) - United Kingdom recorded 62,322 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday 1,041 deaths within 28 days positive test virus, according official data.

What within 28 days? Rolling data? frustrating someone lives California. paying exorbitant rates live somewhere environmentally toxic, high risk natural disasters, extreme level wealth inequality, heavily infected simply care anyone ourselves. 

I'm hoping remote work becomes permanent get hell here.  think info new strains contagious bind human cells differently. Nobody sure exactly means terms precautions day day behavior. thing...just tell blame muslim brotherhood, mark word 😂😂. Yes strain match anything MIQ (managed iso quarantine), previously discovered community, someone would tested negative twice MIQ, spread community one person.

We'll never know, bet still frozen goods. Yeah, adding mistrust federal state governments, think much federal involvement would make things worse. feel like we're reverting medieval times. Like 'yeah mask causing disease people started wearing masks started!' keep seeing said though fact, seen source rich buying vaccine. based fact, speculating? Wow, number keeps going every story. That’s terrible. I’ve read comments inquiring many people government trying cover many, one way, think that’s missing major point.

The fact entire ICU patients dead oxygen ran scary. tell fine line people able survive not. Vietnam NZ used nearly identical strategies. closed borders, national lockdowns, infected people close contacts moved state run quarantine facilities. even talking about? I’m California outdoors activities time...

Beaches open, trails open, parks open mandatory. choose attend concerts theaters, travel, get vaccine. you. 

This fact great way ensure people taking vaccines. Sadly, much like masks social distancing, local / state governments businesses forced choose money safety, choose money fed supporting anyone extend needed.  encourage reluctant firefighters get COVID-19 vaccine, Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) offering raffled prizes willing get prizes gift cards Airbnb Lyft, Canary home security cameras, Google Nest entertainment systems, Aventon fixed-gear bicycles, Los Angeles Times public health officials, 20 40 percent L.A. County front-line workers given priority access COVID-19 vaccine declined take it. hospitals, 50 percent staff refused get far, trend seems affecting firefighters way. 1,000 3,400 vaccinated first week firefighters able receive front-line workers' refusal vaccinated comes county experiences worst coronavirus outbreak Tuesday, least 827,498 coronavirus cases 10,850 deaths L.A. County, according data Johns Hopkins University. Doctor: hey buddy, wakey wakey! saved life

Him: ask to? Imagine many healthcare workers going permanently traumatized this. Egypt. level protection variants years too. bizarre response Im money helps. money really seem problem. rural poor states good rich west coast NYC struggling hard. Exactly this. instantly tell someone know they're talking shriek: cAN't USa lIKE NEW zEAlAND? low bar set. Drastically lower previously planned. Thanks, messed think point same. Lol they're shipped hospitals fast can. like Trump sitting stockpile Biden going magically overnight via FedEx. Well yeah, government covering shit up. government would claim pneumonia accuse fear mongering thought promised vaccine would free? redditors, seemingly extreme introverts probably secretly love heavy isolation. ""Just 2 weeks see"" asymptomatic person probably got something imported, became asymptomatic acted carrier making others sick. different strain one already come outside yeah. guess possible symptoms never got tested reason. We'll never know indeed.  Headline: Covid Vaccine 10 times dangerous flu shot! KiDs CanT sPreaD viRus , yeah turned lie South Dakota reported almost 3500 cases today... anyone know what's that? context it’s accurate fact, yeah. you’re going strawman take things context interest continuing discussing.  Enforcement barely needed NZ. small unarmed police force basically issued warnings people breaking rules. Extremely actually fined. Quarantine negotiated, community leaders minority communities enlisted help convince reluctant families go facilities. still refused allowed remain home police posted house make sure stay inside. happened rarely though. 

That's issue US, population distrustful govt police pandemic became politicised.  Murica, m\*\*\*\*r f\*\*\*\*\*s!!!! God forbid Jake Paul break Scottsdale mall though. would require statewide curfew like week. /s


Or Logan, care tbh. 


The simple fact people AZ like ""freedom"" much care, unless private property harmed. Ok, skip next group then. I'll take odds. Where's shot? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oxygen treatment, blood oxygen falls certain percentage could die. 

It really depends are, certain limited areas like Los Angeles short resources. But, would give treatment sickest people, even someone needs hospitalized think be. Family can't much. happen vaccines. binary. virus mutating entire time existence. Idk vogue, like never happened month. 4.0 billion - 3.9 billion = 100 million Sure, vaccines work like that. Everyone needs else one truly safe. Unless got test didn’t get covid.

That's fact though it...? Wow based headline thought like couple thousand dollars. 


$30 done bullshit?? I’ll take 15 doses please. island bit help UK... probably won’t resonate well sub, think large portion population don’t want first take rushed vax. Im definitely leaning way. Im low risk, also around low risk, wait see others react months. literally story morning LA running oxygen hospitals Lol CDC throws pneumonia flu deaths together one category. could die pneumonia still counted “influenza” statistical despite catching strain flu. 

Realistically real number influenza deaths much, much lower. saw article beginning covid estimating true influenza deaths 100 month US, roughly 1200 annually. 

My grandfather COPD battled pneumonia many, many times. don’t actually think linked influenza happened pakistan 6 people died Nothing changed, anybody did. exposed non relevant drug. hospitals actually full. California uses ""adjusted icu rate"" fancy way saying changed real numbers. Makes sense. wish could say Canada close US, lot rubs mentally challenged population lol. That’s ridiculous. coronavirus influenza actually different viruses, present similar symptoms body infect respiratory system. Could according worldometers USA 1100 deaths per 1M population, 65k total cases per 1M population. country's 1000 deaths 40K total cases per 1M? even care limited unless family medical training supplies hospital better. Even oxygen like said (doubt it) that's probably provide home.  Yes, decimate economy. That's answer. Chicago notorious corrupt public schools (not like America isn’t) mistaken years back didn’t someone close Rahm Emanuel (possibly even wife?) actually siphon money public education fund city? I’ve googling 40 minutes can’t find could’ve sworn saw Vice write years ago. Rlly wish somewhat viable memory lol anyone knows please let know. Also current lockdowns measures nearly harsh enough. Lax holiday guidelines massively increased infections too.

Rules need restrictive punishment non-adherence needs drastically increased.   Great way put Plants double day, answer question never toward upper end exponential growth taper off. surprised all. *sip* ...yep! numerically enough people wealthy problem. like wealth top 100 people bottom 100 million. top 0.1% use 0.1% vaccine doses. 50x sitting freezers used.  definitely feel you. autoimmune condition I'm new profession new district/non-tenured even consider asking accommodation. 

If still lived home extended family (grandparents 80's health issues) would returned school year.

I feel - hope everything works out! Young people rioting restrictions going next winter. Brain drain disgusting term used shame guilt developing countries **WANT** seek better life family another country.

Stealing = offering job opportunity people free either accept reject?

Whoa, guess LA companies hire professionals LA avoid ""stealing"" professionals Mid-West South, uh? Gotta prevent brain drain impoverishing parts country too, right?  exactly oxygen - it’s risk rather 100% certainty get hypoxia. 
How often oxygen contaminated flammable gas (as distilled liquified air)? 
That’s huge explosion hazard nothing else. point also making dent sitting freezer. agree using priorities would best case scenario, working. Flu way countries without covid responses.

Huge fallacy going thread people attributing things may occurred anyway government’s policies. saying policy effect, can’t assume causality. That’s wind religious rituals. right, I'm jealous great America is. wish could live there. Look man, I’m giving facts. reason lose marbles everybody doubting you. 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰  easier manage 5 million people lower rate police per capita authoritarian means enforcing lockdown rules like China did. 

The US lockdowns Covid policies managed state level anyway. governors manage people NZ would ranked 25th population US state, Alabama South Carolina. ease control nothing it. 

The difference voluntary willingness population comply govt asked us, even knowing largely unenforceable. NZ people simply followed rules without question even disagreed them. 

The media cover businesses broke lockdown rules nothing happened aside public disapproval PM saying ""disappointed"" them. very, small number people fined many warnings ignored. think hit head dismount. Irrational optimism got us point first place. doom gloom justified.

Remember half US saying economy important lives hundred thousand people? Sad vaccine developed record time earliest estimates Fall 2021 experts. right, science says much less likely kids infect department store. quite different. evidence suggesting EMA accept laxer results FDA.

Your quote goes far : lower effect vaccine may still approved.

It doesn’t say lower still accept. I’d rather false confidence. Army medic gave shots Soldiers. takes 2 minutes teach it. fingers crossed for. cases death rate dropping ""soon"" immunity building up. worry people still carry spread virus hopefully work way. never hear wubs way again.  I’m sure people dying homes hospitals capacity take solace fact state could worse statistically  Maybe surround shitty people. less severe symptoms, less infectious someone is, generally speaking. odds BF probably fairly low Good.

This covid issue China rest world suffers.

We really need tighter restrictions &amp; better enforcement. hospitals shut up, expensive part going hospital fucking *parking*

Edit: want laugh parking fees *huge* healthcare controversy province every election opposition brings gotcha numbers seem completely unfathomable. sorry losses could prevented (largely) even mediocre leadership. I'm confused. workers money businesses money government deep debt asking heck money went.

A crisis means business losses. Businesses, especially large ones, entitled demand handout start working emergency solutions. 

In general they're entitled guarantee business plan working past continue work now. Horse meet auto.

So they'd better start working harsh reality virus care plans were, small scale large.

I tend apply Uncle Ben standard. decision-making spending power comes responsibility. system means investors officials accountable calling shots failing to. GOOD!  Yeah pretty sure governments happy pay tens billions get this

Ask Bojo alone he'd pay covid go away right positive news get today PCR. Yeah, get that. completely agree people say New Zealand island that's cases low. definitely helps, biggest factors government response people general. county decent sized city 10% confirmed infected. keep waiting cases drop they've slowed, they're still going. know many actually we're nowhere near 10x. Maybe 5x even we'd 50% confirmed I'd still think we'd see taper off. Maybe they've good testing something.  Good information - thank you! Try use punctuations want people believe you. wanted express frustration horrible headline, regardless content. can't study ""suggest"" x ""indeed"" y. Either study confirms x indeed y, study suggests x y. combination two strikes poor wording. people put situation? Oh well cuz gov done dick support people.  UK necessarily role model Interesting. DeSantis said fight local effort control spread via shut penalizing individuals violating local mask mandates. 

Seems leaders Tampa Bay finding ways “shut down” businesses taking steps support public health. part much larger nation travel restricted Move African variant/strain. evidence immunity lasts long period time short period time. Like said, mind, reality is. Better accept it. Oh, sorry. hard tell days. Especially Fauci quotes since he's changed number like 4 times already admitted lying begin with. saying title incorrect...but certainly meant hyperbolic misleading. Oh shit accidentally dropped info ahead inauguration! allow people anything serious expect soldiers somewhat reliable true I'm gay acknowledge role slaves building country ""businessmen"" masters? body tends conserve energy stressed. We've long slow-roll stress event. kind yourself. * *dies American* * whenever there's good news people sub quick rush bend backwards say wrong, even someone reputable like Fauci. 

The day thread people complaining one companies making vaccine would ""only"" making enough vaccinations vaccinate 5% global population mid year. Keep mind one company.

Tons good news constantly dies new

This sub incredibly pessimistic, ""negative opinions criticisms government's handling virus"" signs point light end tunnel people want shoot down. Excessively optimistic people need pump breaks Jesus talking Fauci original post  it’s funding issue get money them. it’s lack staff holding military help. Guidelines prioritization could changed incentivize hospitals speed up, etc. Lying like US president does. people supposed charge care. IMHO, pandemic changes re: Movie theatres- they're probably going become even luxury, nice thing every often rather going every week. put perspective: UK end significant covid restrictions year, major portion spent full lockdown. average life expectancy 80, average person ""lose"" 1.25% life this, even restrictions continue late 2021 (which recently suggested possibility Christopher Whitty). 'That's part life.' That's keep hearing now. Tiny island nations easy comes pandemic backing 🙄 it'll probably stupid order puts every ""essential worker"" elderly vulnerable. zero faith government's ability distribute vaccine. Ah see, misread it. Thank think it’s interesting one reasons trials went quick Covid widespread blew benchmarks infections really quickly (and even set new ones).  Much time previous vaccines spent waiting waiting fir particular # placebo group become infected.  People act like it’s actually bunch people sitting lab analyzing potential vaccine it’s like waiting enough people become infected numbers crunch. UK currently. leave home basically ""essential"" shopping, limited exercise emergencies like seeking medical attention. going work absolutely work elsewhere. wildly fantastic imagination have. different. seems UK variant much widespread globally South African variant. 

In cruel twist fate South African variant seems even contagious UK variant. starts 2021... completely ignoring fact vaccines causing Bell’s Palsy Africa. media probably shouldn’t last stop scientific information basically ever... fact Germany also succeeded take away success OWS. vaccines better. think would better US offer funding exchange complete control IP, would lot $1 billion something valuable. There's much US could differently. won't. many people scream bloody murder even much mention (actual) lockdowns. even wear mask ""me, me, me"" culture.
 
Covid go unhindered everyone either infected vaccinated extent herd immunity achieved. hospitals aren’t distributing efficiently. Preach!!! Ah yeah, classic ‘It prank, bro...’. Learn technically means, guess? I'm implying NZ amazing job, US totally shit bed. that, even countries acted perfectly, would easier control NZ, tiny population, travelers country able identified. So? He’s trained virologist. would like listening Bill Nye astronomy listen Neil Degrasse Tyson bc Tyson degree Astronomy. think Florida survives flooding course. God, mean point better pretty good movie. point is? Irony: assuming I'm American even though I'm saying America *worse* per capitas suggest.

I'm Canadian criticize US handling every single thing listed. I'm insulted. Fauci's job restate people paying attention already know....mainly whole bunch people caring enough.  say wrong make headline?

What mean? number they're drawing R0 number. There's zero chance testing accurate unless test every single person population. people refusing get tested, able get tested, realizing they're sick getting tested, R0 produce realistic estimate. medication food ... Come mate. vast majority mainland, vast majority live, composed two islands. Yes islands part New Zealand, im aware. mostly comprised two large islands, correct? guess shouldve called single island youd really pissed huh. Hey there, thank sharing experience. really sucks deal that. cognitive block described part brain sleep mode like hollow body -- good way describe fog. Apart ultimate strain medical system, business sectors going notice much workaholics kept things going. 

If ever (or anyone else who's dealing post COVID) feel need vent, inbox open. 


For love things good, **gaslighters stay away**. Bullshit title make difference” blatantly false

you're ignoring last part comment replied make difference Covid present all, thus elimination approach. stop cases border, winter risk.

&amp;#x200B;

is **\[if\]** Covid present all, thus elimination approach. problem muchacho. encourage people sceptical information. become difficult wade sea disinformation campaigns, foreign domestic. nothing wrong posing questions, else would learn? vigilant source material formulate views. English Virus every single person eligible needs vaccinated. one 16 vaccinated something like 40% deaths people 80 nursing homes. make massive dent 1+ million day months. absolutely true. opposite. could higher transmissibility mutation. Yall paying 20 euros damn pizza delivery wont pay 15 marvel biotech, delivered extremely low temperatures. Smh Taken literally correct this. guess indication UK gov's desperation. 1,000 deaths per day need reduce quickly. eased much Christmas. nothing good ever come rushing things, human error example. 90% population would need get vaccinated achieve herd immunity, Dr. Fauci. I’m sorry, what? Except half kids parents anti maskers sorts gathering. least won’t leadership last year. Thx input! I’ll tell American, fucking SICK everything turning American politics. Holy shit annoying, tiresome beat fucking ground looks overall balance safety efficacy vaccine individually 

Individually, comparing existing vaccines. ? effective enough. want anything 90% prefer teaching younger kids frankly kids switching rooms 7 times day would make wary. Wow, surprised two active duty soldiers died this. would imagine would spread quickly military since lot people living working close quarters. guess soldiers tend young healthy, offers lot protection. It’s easy. People literally choosing “do want kid catch covid school, homeless shelter”. It’s “no wage spend” meme taken downright murderous absurdity.

We can’t leave single low income parents 1800 year surprise pikachu face say “my kid needs go school work” Sweden lower mortality years too. link strictness restrictions entirely clear cut companies wouldnt exist. 

We call nonprofits ngos. 

The whole reason companies exist act money generating machine. actual vaccine rollout actual country fault EU. wish would receive fairly low doses receive right Pfizer/Biontech vaccine blame EU purchase enough chance. Many workers truly front line already covid. Given results come recently regarding natural immunity, unreasonable pass (for time being) vaccine already it. Yep. UK India best knowledge. think I'm addition this, middle-class Americans insurance think treated like low-income Americans Medicaid. 

The rich still get best medical care afford it. everyone else get scraps (similar scenarios see play time time country). think great much lower income raised meet middle class, lower middle class.

IMO, way insure quality medical care install leaders also ""one us"" pay elite.

Of course issue nothing lasts forever. Worst case scenario would nationalized medicine corrupt, capitalist government. kill ? don;t harm lockdown, believe downvoted onset appearance skepticism towards subject. 

Without study, simple math believe teacher able consider. We're learning we're going Covid one thing data always known trusted proper applications. creator PCR test even stated proper application test results.. proper application saying ""yes data fits"". actual mortality rate covid hairline worth increment less prevented long deaths create database this. say Covid less deadly predicted slightly off. practice applying data perceived observation something scientists usually practice with. dont practice pandemic. Instead focusing getting numbers near perfect, focus saving lives!

That easy understand math; combinations come contact sickness. cancer people tend risk contracting due DNA heritage. contract Covid coming contact symptoms. Okay sick kids can't go school, problems solved. No, virus may still spread even sick person sneezing coughing coupled fact keep repeating kids less likely symptomatic. creates combinations teacher come contact virus increasing infection rate 333%. Let's scare anyone, means teachers 3 &amp; ⅓ times likely non teachers contract virus. come contact one sick person, likely come contact least 3 sick people. stated mortality rate, application can't ⅓ person. application makes sense honestly think higher. 3:1 ratio teacher non teacher. school 500-1500 students, believe could higher maybe I'm ignorant prevention methods taking place public schools.

Anyway upvoted feel like everyone share opinions embrace differences ignorance. firmly believe that's Tijuana. circle friends acquaintances went like 3 cases 40 span two weeks. Keep mind Mexico thanksgiving. Dia de Muertos cemeteries closed due pandemic. Economy nutshell. not? can't Louisiana things NZ? Montana, Wyoming, Nevada...

Or even better: can't Hawaii copy NZ way? Yes. Pfizer set price lower German funding. Pfizer vaccine costs US actually far Moderna. EU gets Pfizer, Moderna, discount, large difference Thank God cooler heads charge. Jesus dystopian Christ boycotting US products too?

Yes, far practical - ever since allowed Trump president. holier thou. You’re sucky position two aren’t comparable, mine isn’t comparable anyone healthcare someone regularly played plague inc, trajectory COVID align ""winning"" game, fact would pretty bad run anyone isnt new game. Vaccine already covid didnt even take .3% US population. Yes. Sounds line saying, specific November. AstraZaneca 70% effective, hope bring either Pfizer Moderna next proposing make covid vaccine mandatory?  honestly wonder 'black market value' vaccine would be. 

I'd wager rich people would pay upwards 100k. article blocked Swedish IPs. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ that, even countries acted perfectly, would easier control NZ, tiny population, travelers country able identified. 

Vietnam? Taiwan? China? would’ve thought... 

Well noted PM announced lockdown - evidence clear. 
The evidence existed (from America) 1918 flu pandemic best course economy lockdown.
The available all, course businessmen ""knew"" better. need drive-in theaters, anyways. Correct I’m wrong. friend lives NZ, told beginning lockdowns, police would write didn’t legitimate reason house. 

Yes voluntary willingness. You’re right. island country ~5 million ppl one PM likely comply rules country ~330 million people 50 different governors telling different things mean sure wouldn’t someone working grocery store comparable position?

They seeing hundreds customers 8 hour shift ""The number died within 28 days positive test past week 37% higher previous seven days."" small handful things closed (schools, in-person dining/bars, theme parks, campgrounds)

that lot stuff. stores open source transmission.  I'm scientist feeling seen kids UK last thing open, shut everything else. 

It would like shut everything pubs we'd see rise cases people 20-50 acknowledging situation that's ironic, fact criticized China?

Earlier mentioned thought ironic China America share similar flaws. That's called coincidence.

You sure love change story, you?

Also, order particular situation ironic, would scenario America China discussed worthy praise. **not** scenario. know keep thinking case. realize that, discussion praising country (China), allowed criticize even though country suffers flaws, right? **not** ironic nobody thread mentioned praising America's efforts. Many Americans know country handle situation correctly, conversation explicitly mentioning praising China's efforts.

How hard understand? vaccine protects yourself, necessarily mean can't still spread others. Discovery Magazine talked issue.

""Trials shown vaccines prevent people getting sick, prevent people getting infected virus passing on.

The distinction often ignored, researchers say central determining long-term course pandemic, Indonesia around world."" oooh true also 1/10th amount space (10K sq/mi) New Zealand (100k sq/mi) believe New Zealand closed completely travelers.

Immunity binary. article says immunity last certain amount time, mean outliers person's experience invalid. time, person's experience mean studies wrong. people get chicken pox twice. Crazy shit happens. Americans good acting best interests, like refusing masks vaccines electing sociopathic narcissist. Afaik, temporary would allow smooth transition. main reason.

US failed horribly that. watch video? oxygen supply failed, nothing COULD done. see one using bottles manually pump air in, AFAIK, temporary measures dont think would last long, obviously many hand. man video exclaiming everyone dead, seems like well past time action anyways. thought analogy, that's exactly want masks grocery store become thing. honest? doubt boring sitting be, pretty stressful agitated psych patients. 

I worked hospital since mid August worked post acute part time mainly one male techs get called swap wild ones. 

I definitely glad spending time baby sometimes feel guilty helping mess. Especially little people take seriously. know crazy shortages quickly things change.

Great, seen hospitals best giving vaccines. also fine people died breathing hard times making fool country. I’ve reading excess death studies covid since first started released can’t remember single one 25 percent. links?

This study october found 33 percent 225 530 excess deaths, 150 541 (67%) attributed COVID-19. Joinpoint analyses revealed increase deaths attributed causes COVID-19, 2 reaching statistical significance. US mortality rates heart disease increased weeks ending March 21 April 11 (APC, 5.1 [95% CI, 0.2-10.2]), driven spring surge COVID-19 cases. Mortality rates Alzheimer disease/dementia increased twice, weeks ending March 21 April 11 (APC, 7.3 [95% CI, 2.9-11.8]) weeks ending June 6 July 25 (APC, 1.5 [95% CI, 0.8-2.3]), latter coinciding summer surge sunbelt one July found 28 percent undercount that’s lowest think undercount may worsened counting dead became political issue.  really sure read.

Either way, still drastic difference population. Exactly ass downvoted LOL  source that? Official Swedish stats put excess deaths 5,61 percent fo 6 December. Significantly lower global average still less zero like claim. think point disagreement around word “rushed”. It’s disingenuous scientifically inaccurate. 

The reason trials concluded quickly mammoth levels infection across world. fears around unexplored long term side effects (potentially missed trials) mostly chalked misinformation. No, really. probably access monoclonal antibody treatments, nearly effective vaccine. know lot people, including health workers, going hang back wait data getting jab, high 50% declining places.

I would say matters USA household income $20,000 higher, access cheaper food government gives lower income Americans things like EBT / ""Food Stamps"".

Then there's idiosyncrasies like Planet Fitness giving people free pizza every week. appreciate compliment. plenty examples countries supported people business owners. kind multi-nationals. governments populations following along guidelines extremely cautious. That's allowed avoid major disruption also stage reopening safely manages covid risk. shit complicated. okay? spent good time telling multiple people read article think suspicious... Well I've read article rude wrong - team need visas, correct, I'm sure understand China gives visas... Chinese government agree investigation take place comes give visas, yeah little suspect... Rudey... realise many experts UK Quebec disagree that. 


The list british experts back approach pretty long includes major british medical organisations. 


Framing 'medically immoral' deeply misleading. cost benefit analysis countries decided one way countries another. need panic covid isn’t dangerous people plus actually things improve immune system whole lockdown bullshit pathetic. Survival fittest like nature intended. much better headline article, one gilded 1000's upvotes. teachers double work cater forms teaching. anybody else hopeless depressed fuck? feeling way lately......have feeling never  Biden doesnt need follow suit US already signed deal early 2020 china. It'd dope hospital moment. Talk right place right time. weeks away guess we're 'very, fucked' then.  also subtract number people already covid, kind immunity 6 months 1-2 years more.

So maybe 30-60 million, assume 10-20% past covid. kill might make relatively sick. 600$ isn’t enough?  /s never change. 

C.R.E.A.M. Caveat there’s hard data, anecdotally seems SoCal lots people ignoring protocols. Bay Area better hasn’t nearly bad UK full lockdown one year latter people saying would May 2020 still dare call people doom mongers. Amazing. great news. I'm guessing Indians who've survived diseases good immune systems.  Autopsy done week. Wait facts rather jump conclusions. UK continues vaccinating rate it'll take around year vaccinate 60's (source: BBC) spurious statistic vaccinations given Oxford vaccine rolled yesterday (Tues 5th Jan 2021) what? Covaxin one need. sold AZ's No, thinking worth take IgG test vaccination sure. (Not would happen anytime soon EU non prioritized persons like me). trust vaccine go traveling instead testing :) real count

if want talk ""real count"" go total mortality, reported deaths. 2000s, approximately 90,000 people died year, peak 2002 95,000 died. 2019, fewer 89,000 people died, lowest number deaths single year since 1977. [Statistics ~95 000

2019: 88 766

2018: 92 185

2017: 91 972

2016: 90 982

2015: 90 907 beautiful person. never fam Hopefully, federal aid wont stingy. hopefully agencies empowered provide effective messaging public That's also government problem. easily regulate travel. refusal allow Wuhan

So what's solution? let anyone enter China without visa long say they're part research/investigation team WHO? one sweden wearing masks dear leader says work.

The difference swedish finnish border towns sad. 10 times case numbers swedish side zero masks vs 70-80% mask usage finnish side. damn, hillary didn’t follow through? Shoes really work analogy case. like brother trapped smoke filled room waiting rescued one gas mask designed one person. one brother solely use gas mask complete protection designed leave completely without, share gas mask get benefit compromised somewhat?  Thanks reminder. needed badly. people states stop working? think real reason. guess? Older dying home given Covid19 test pass away. Another quite used older people, women children dying simple things like flu etc. 

Only question Covid19 deaths higher burning ghats, crematoriums , burial grounds become busy? sorry hear situation. middle school teacher too. I’m terrified. Everyone acts like big deal. reasoning kids don’t get sick. everyone else? feel expendable career already makes feel like I’m blame students’ problems. opinion borne anger careful analysis. matter whether saying false? get Portillo’s drive thru job, whole state vaccinated week. *Stephen Miller entered chat* Also (and rather ironically) individuals US concerned freedom infect others, don’t need wear masks anywhere. attend sports events NYE concerts thousands others, go church (if thing), eat packed restaurants, hug grandparents made sure Christmas. without fear might become infected infect others. freedom earned sacrifices thanks fantastic fellow citizens public service workers, never forget it. Hmm. You’d make truly shitty boss. Duh. virus nearly extinct spring summer Europe. EU pat back laughed America. came fall answer clear. virus different airborne, respiratory virusses. goes away spring/summer, comes back fall/winter. haha Yes, read article. Try again.  Well, W wasn’t surrounded complete total incompetent sycophants. COVID-01 happened, top 9/11, patriot act would gone helluva lot further. herd immunity means multiple waves easily. small spike festival season barely. Anti-maskers prevalent world, America. typical reactionary position would happening regardless Trump. option act quickly aggressively stamp local transmission ASAP.

Or, know, could shit bed like US. one man sucking enough bring entire nation point, got incredibly broken system begin with, started long elected. Yeah what's going comments? agree right take masks means go concert, visit family safely, go parties, get college education, general fear every time go could get sick get someone love dead. mind masks last thing go that’s ok me. way hindered wear mask, well I’m really hindered I've told companies lot money... Masks everyday situations, bar closures, etc. end late spring-early summer elderly chance get vaccinated (none ""oh people rare conditions might protected still need wear masks prevent spread

This big one people consider. likely we'll back normal everyday things without masks distancing (as long we're vaccinated ourselves) months final re-opening phase we're starting open large events back Trying see got placebo not? :)

Anyway, research correct. Vaccines may show standard antibody test. ignorance. mentioned airborne spread suggested airborne virus via aerosol spread.  aerosol form ""airborne"" transmission referred BMJ article. took September CDC mention website. 

Your point regarding correct use airborne/aerosol irrelevant irregardless. message public received initially CDC WHO. Specifically idea virus proven spread air need masks. suggest say initially misinterpretation media, speak correct error several months? newspaper article published today attributes reason mainly ""Localised herd immunity"". People almost resumed normal life basic precautions like using mask nowhere near expectations. article acknowledge second wave india western countries europe america reporting 3rd, 4th waves. 

Why difference ? puzzling. reality, reality like story [""The Grasshopper Texas absolutely fiiiilllled fucking idiots. mortality rate 30 extremely low, covid much less dangerous things like driving, diseases. It’d dumb shut world that. 

Hospital workers larger workload risk groups vaccinated. majority people get covid don’t need hospitalized, ones risk group. 

Not really sure you’re trying argue. think things never going back normal delusional lol. gotten every pandemic history, lot way deadlier one. Stop fear mongering read article. nothing suspicious denying entry people visa AKA entry pass country. sure mechanics portable devices marketed oxygen therapy patients produce supplemental oxygen called oxygen concentrators (Inogen well-known brand). ridiculous. people saying pandemic, delusional. lot people problems “won’t happen me” thinking. People think way EVERYTHING. easy justify actions harshly condemn others. truly hope never texted Driven, sped wile driving, used blinker, gone sick pandemic, etc. 

These head examples things risk others yet people time. many times road seen someone speed past think “asshole”? know almost every time. also sped like asshole late interview. Calling people’s behavior terrorism saying citizenship revoked fucking extreme it’s even funny. 

Then bring slavery even worse. basically dehumanized every single person breaks health laws said worthy slavery? (And know said pandemic deniers isn’t exactly same, mind bet are). exactly kind thinking made genocide acceptable nazis African slave trade ok. 

Get fucking high horse offer people grace. massive amounts misinformation flying around peoples general fear government America, don’t blame them.  Sadly, lot outside quicker vaccination rollout. Trump’s caused thing get absolutely control So, get immediately then, he.

*Immediately (adverb): without intervening time space; once; instantly* Holy shit...  Considering 3 people 7-11 yesterday completely fucking maskless, concur. Fuck selfish lazy fucking morons. Cuomo thing New York right now. he’s pretty openly criminal.

Wouldn’t surprised reverses orders tomorrow. People pissed  1 teacher frees 30 households get back work, 1 grocery store worker provides relief 1 household shorter lines grocery store. daycare, education That's wrong, kiddo. aren’t tourists holiday China, motherfucking investigators pandemic. 
China capability fast track visa process, honestly think sat pile waiting processed? read article say things.  Thank flew China without visa course they'll denied entry... Congratulations!

Also anecdotal I’ve heard many people LA wearing masks respecting COVID. aliens playing Plague inc easy difficulty? Dharavi slum Mumbai example much lower IFR compared Mumbai non-slum (by factor 4). 

Slums population much younger average, lower IFR expected alone. Basically, slum dwellers lower chances live long enough COVID become concern.

It's definitely metric gauge pandemic lol. get ICU capacity something needs considered, people need use ICU order die, ICU capacity concern people getting sick risk dying. pretend 30 year olds ICU means we'll overwhelmed without restrictions, like 2 every 1000 30 year olds get virus going die without ICU care opposed 15% 80 year olds. old people get vaccination, ICU problem goes away vast majority healthy adults survive without hospitalization, even ones severe cases. CCP self imposed great leap culture revolution, Vietnam bombing sanctions. Vietnam pretty much good relations nations, China hand... Lucky citizens, feel guilty spreading virus. think Trump certainly played big part encouraging anti maskers. Though agree anti maskers everywhere US, far prevalent. moment UAE residents, including foreign workers, still enjoy civil rights governments Europe America taken people.

UAE residents free travel around country abroad, eat indoors restaurants, see films cinemas, work gyms, meet groups people. Meanwhile UK, Ireland US states, people even freedom movement taken away government. government even dictates allowed see friends family many allowed see. 

This UAE eradicated coronavirus. taken respectful approach managing infringe human rights done protect vulnerable. Difficult lock straight dying care house? Everyone that.

That's rub...not everyone that.

For do, yes, unpaid job consider such. one begrudging that. concern homemaking childcare often falls exclusively women dual adult household often ""real"" jobs. called ""second shift"" relevant literate like read it. Many modern households equitable divisions labor conversations happened largely consequence Arlie's book. UK guidance recommended absolute last resort doses vaccine available

I'm sure meant that.

I believe guidance covered unknown original dose given therefore procedures use thereafter, may misread it. preclude deadly mutation happening though. Jus tthat less likely long lasting. deadly, transmissable strain would horrifying, even short lived. second wave Spanish Flu much deadly could due mutation. ""Oh mark every death covid death"" think virus handled well China even need vaccine. centralized head source information came from, could vetted whether true Americans fail lying priority learning others Good! shouldn’t put risk job. Vaccines first, return work. majority green house gasses produced minority people. Killing lots people little effect production green house gasses.  Honestly lower vaccine priority like myself, think it’s going come weighing acceptable risk learning live it. everyone going learn live reality coronavirus Strains keep mutating. It’s discouraging sure hope. That's another 100,000 deaths US minimum recajigger new vaccinne. believe relatively moderate infections per capital, LA metro area well 15 million people, even moderate rate infections per capita means huge number sick people. 

We're relatively moderate infections per capita, we're third top three states infections per capita.

[NBC News:These three states worst Covid infection rates anywhere  excuse taken long analyze multiple countries equally stringent committees approved it.

It's even worse consider accelerated timeline meeting could've week later. could 2000 day LA county Well, true know SOMETHING, based study people received TWO jabs. extrapolate knowledge dangerous scientific, that's I'm saying.

So accept immunity 2 jab scheme assumed 2 months then. Anything dangerous extrapolation. Wow, finally people think facts regarding vaccine! anti-vaxx, pro-vaxx, fact-vaxx. found sub! Hey, shit good intentions. Agreed. Anything else would really concerning would mean governments taking totalitarian measures longer justification saving lives. mean, duh.

The reason past pandemics weren’t overwhelming diseases effective killing us. It’s harder spread swine flu tend get sick right away leaves unable stand up, opposed walking around symptom-free spreading around first.

It’s matter when, if, that’s need invest better ways monitor enforce compliance safety measures. Fine. 25k.

The point comment process.  Imagine surviving worst Taliban ISIS throw killed President calls 'fake news'. hope complete safety review, find safe, approve it. Although believe vaccine safe data shows it, consider analyzing carefully ""faffing around"". spewing misinformation? Israel offered Palestine aid getting vaccinated refused. Instead Palestine making plans get Russian vaccine Honestly fact we're nearly year thing every single person airport rapid tested entering mind-boggling.

I returned UK US flight nearly completely full. one people prove negative test prior getting plane. Watched webinar Belgian top doctor vaccinations. Turns half vaccinations performed wrong. high, low, deep enough, long time shots. unbelievable much go wrong. Yes does. Care home residents account 1/3 deaths. Remove equation ICU deaths plummet. say reduce 0. Also, remember vaccination 80+ year olds also taking place outside care homes average age death 80 point people going anyway. take 10, 25, 50k speedy it.  Well, true know SOMETHING, based study people received TWO jabs. extrapolate knowledge dangerous scientific, that's I'm saying.

Also, UK authorities scientists went herd immunity Italians already piling bodies. much trust judgement, even less scientists' independence. read? that’s said all.

I also didn’t say data wasn’t accurate, anyone knows even absolute minimum statistics knows basic data means much. spit absolute facts simultaneously ignoring reality situation.

And reality situation population density US versus Europe comparable. matter hard cry. It’s anti-American sentiment either- it’s reality. cities actually better rural areas, outside NYC hit early on. it, rural towns competing per capita densest cities world.

When people live top other, virus going spread matter what. people opportunity spread out, like majority US, problem boils citizens following restrictions. get might complex you, goddamn dude. 70 million nickels cents dumb act like hospital capacity can't increased. Like almost year. Come on. China built hospital like 3 weeks first outbreak. AZ month, there's time waste. 1/4 country would vaccinated June Pfizer Moderna (double dose). Sweden fact 3 parallel systems governance/administration - national government, regions municipalities. FHM part national governance / authorities. Hospitals managed regional governments. Care homes, elderly homes, special housings managed municipalities. Hospital deaths often reported quite fast, system already established managing high levels reporting - go direct healthcare database national-wide. However, deaths occurred elderly care special housing, first get reported specific home home's healthcare provider (some homes private, run directly municipality), provider reports municipality, municipality reports region, region reports FHM. Prior holidays meant 90% deaths reported within 11 days, (50% reported less 7 days). However, holidays, means people chain reporting might taking leave also two days week report things, lag increased three weeks more. hoping go week public holidays (until Easter least). read post guy saying doctor 20 years seen all, never seen death certificate say ""flu"". would ""pneumonia"" complications. I'm guessing that's what's going here. 

The flu numbers throw around (for US least) statistical estimates number probably died it. early people compared best-guess numbers test-confirmed covid deaths declared flu bad. One see effect everywhere Europe still school locked students suffering learning less less. heading generation uneducated people get it, sucks, long time. think going ""open up"" go back ""normal"" mistaken. Things arent ever going rushing doesnt anything put people risk.

Nah, fuck this. free hide house rest life. soon people vaccinated I'm burning masks bonfire, saying ""fuck you"" social distancing, hitting bars. keep denying everything, covid lol. morons underplaying everything main reason trouble, that's continue reach estimates previously considered 'extreme' . Idiots EU pat back laughed America. 

I getting bit mad sort *you'll see, we'll see winter* kind way. I’d happily last line 10k ...6g we're 6g now. Wifi 6 bust. dont want upgrade vaccine chip year that's much work. wait 6g disagree you. suggesting want fire them? Middle pandemic. think many teachers going walk? Sorry, mistake. Netherlands “Welcome wall party” says jaded EMT new arrivals. psych police custody patients agitated waiting walls. 

Not mean dismiss efforts, turn detective novel? likely fact people gather outside boosted virus, seems seasonal component.

People gathering inside rather outside seasonal component. seems misunderstanding seasonality implies environmental factors like far droplets spread x temp humidity. Seasonality involves environmental behavioral factors spread respiratory illnesses winter. fact kids usually school winter summer? Yes even part flu's seasonality. work air traffic controllers 81? plan? ask plan was? Soon? mean like months ago needed soon? Sorry archive isn’t working right *cries Tagalog* Short total isolation (i.e. one ever enters leaves house reason), acting responsibly reduces chances contracting virus various degrees. enough people community get it, even relatively strict individual measures protect much. mutated before? Well countries already contained taking measures wont much issue countries contained since start LOL, good luck cos really going need it. Im kidding all, dealt year multiple vaccines come NOBODY say prepared it. would liked see police least try enforce covid regulations gusto drug regulations. IMO Violating things like quarantine mask rules really drunk driving drug use harm uninvolved third parties. Europe, they're full classes. Nothing like hybrid programs proposed United States. see that. Post black death lead renaissance, post Spanish flu led roaring 20's- let's see happens post COVID. 

Did read interview w/ sociologist wherein predicted another ""boom"" post COVID cultivate first, pretty much every country world (and whole lot companies) capacity personel so.

that's one scariest parts bio warfare, particularly hard expensive do. recover covid get sense smell back.... consider lucky. UK announced new strain, assumed already NY. basically happened last year March-- whatever's hot Europe gonna hit New York City first. Especially considering total amount covid world like 2 fluid ounces. 69 PhDs 420 certifications. there's never person that's symptomatic symptomatic, symptomatic many months testing positive times. Symptomatic indicates active infection, paper cited states (replicating virus 1 symptomatic individual tested positive). longest we've person test positive symptomatic immunocompromised cancer patient shed virus around 61 days. 253 days, case OP's people unheard of. Especially considering symptomatic times. 

Reinfection much likely. ""a...duh."" 

Seriously, like saying water wet. reason anyone even knows uk actually bothers keep sequencing covid genomes. time find it, everywhere. sane society would something information. whims stupid among us. Well thats obvious. Even states locked like california still bars going Im pretty sure everywhere. mean administrators might reduce inflated bonuses actually tighten belt couldn’t cut staffing instead difference vaccine within months started vaccinating beginning pandemic

I mean you’re still saying lifetime pandemic.

This death 60 years medical technological progress.

If virus hit 50s, wouldve wiped almost every person annoys boomers like flex call younger generations snowflakes, there's grain truth that. People call postwar generation America's golden age, think people went 1950s-60s, staggered years time - Massive war, deadly pandemic, assassination president, massive war deadly pandemic, capped stagflation recession.

Imagine gatekeeping suffering. website assumes two vaccines Flu vaccine rates. way that.  know you’re island right New Zealand? They’re still human they’re still public. Whether agree former not, latter still true. parents constantly supervising sister’s kids, work giving, finished early afternoon, parents tried give educational stuff do. think administrators district trying “force” kids come back classroom. Texas county consistently resisted things like masks social distancing. Nah theory right. still threaten people cant get vaccinated due health issues. least happen charged ppe needs bw used contact frequent tests necessary quarantined. Bitcoin meant p2p cash. king religion, boring old money.

BTC thats another story. Well chances dying 1%. thing goes. can’t force resident / general member public take it. job mandatory. even vaccine eventually administered almost everyone, masks, social distancing etc still going thing. Depending Vaccine it’s 100% effective, measures would still place. would nurses bringing virus it’s nurses vaccinated. completely honest I’m sort shocked they’re saying no, nurse usually wanting help, job. 

I get point chances residents getting Covid nurses vaccinated 3 &amp; 6 percent ( vaccine dependent ). could argued residents vaccinated all. I’m arguing that, could argument it. Unfortunately would need replace staff robots suggesting. There's two former Yugoslavia countries EU, Slovenia Croatia.

Albiania article calls balcan might less rich western European countries global scale still one richest countries world. Bulgaria maybe less so, still far could considered third world.

The ""balcan"" countries mentioned article third world either. They're EU's poorest country, Bulgaria.

Note EU keeping locked EU. North Macedonia disputes neighbours, Serbia want join (but guess expects free vaccines EU anyway ... ?) Albania started talks march 2020. Lady released information house raided property confiscated. Oh wait Florida Yes Ireland among European countries, take care elderly. America (in many cases) far different. fortunate live sibling look other, others financial means, stay nice retirement community.
I would say vast majority though, considered burden. one times acknowledged reading will. woah you’re describing situation extremely close mine... sick mid March 5 weeks, couldnt get test pandemic started. cough week one, shortness breath (would keep night), fatigue, felt like lungs couldnt fill completely, later weeks extremely loss appetite. 5 weeks appetite almost immediately came back felt much normal. week later congestion slight shortness breath came back I’ve kinda way ever since. 

I constantly clear throat/lungs congestion sometimes feels like shortness breath able absorb oxygen properly. days suppose feel better every day day congestion clear throat for. shortness breath feels like get winded easily can’t fully catch breath. 

I huge suspicion year gotten COVID March, month ago took antibody test came back negative, feel may false negative taking late seeing comments post. one related most. know right way finesse shit virtually whatever want, least drastically less school interesting see. oxygen ran out, would typically run entire hospital, ICU alarms would sound enough time replenish long ran out.

The point I'm trying make use word ""failure"" implies something went wrong, engineering related. Although possible unlikely, much likely negligence.  politicians make kinds promises lmao. articles coming people breaking partie scoming every week US.

Tell population stop selfish assholes maybe yall wont salty NZ celebrates good things aboit response. Food thought : many deaths happening counted, media capture it? 

The death count might 5-10 percent margin error still quite low india younger population definitely helping. guy gets it. reason word ""illegal"" exists Kind agree. However, posting, found several legit sources unfortunately would considered duplicate posting mods... even deleted one... um. people die every day cant afford medicine due insurance companies covering still think thats disappointing figure... People dying vaccines save lives urgency nearly enough. Almost 12M doses distributed used. need get point distributed supply used days distributed weeks 0 never realistic 366,943 close best case scenario forecasted much time passed obvious negative reaction shot? literally don’t choice. screw like US, UK, Sweden etc, it’s them. anyone know economy doing? Asking hate response simply compare data country (Germany) actually paid lot. article mention whether school staff contracting COVID school school. local high school COVID problem remote learning months rest schools continue person. Since moving remote learning, high school still post regular positive COVID test staff working remotely, rate far greater school. Major hospitals area also reporting staff members getting COVID outside work choose follow protocols free time. schools district working hard low positivity rates amoung students staff. school follow protocols low chance transmitting COVID. Auckland cluster I'm pretty sure linked back rubbish bin? could wrong though Lol “get it”

You realize aren’t getting year anything want right? would think time consultant would start process. feels like political ass covering anything else. Who's Tommy John? general, mean restrictions (as anyone get it)? so, probably sooner that. likely supply shortages. iron lung yes.... i'd good either way totally sure, article indicates Germany lot cases among elderly right may simply surge UK concentrated younger lower risk population Germany higher percentage severe cases Germany now. Agreed. States think expanding list put pressure hospitals release supply. far that’s really panning out. hospital stock claim still vaccinating staff....after 3 weeks continuous supply, still won’t offer public. It’s also medical school (connected it), suspect also vaccinating medical students.

Currently reading zero sense smell. Yankee scented oil, bleach, vinegar, perfume, spicy food... everything smells like water. understand it, vaccinated, still get Covid potentially transmit it, milder case, resident could still get it. go back forth mandating things become slippery slope. happens company mandates employee dies?

Hungary might less rich western European countries global scale still one richest countries world. Bulgaria maybe less so, still far could considered third world. Agreed. problem there’s central leadership distribution. States Federal government concerned supply side. They’ve left hospitals, pharmacies cities get out. Everyone conservative. local pharmacy stockpiling enough vaccinate nursing home (including workers) total....rather go back daily try keep track got didn’t. understand point. hospitals stockpiling cover workers, it’s taking get workers get (and may choosing get it, hospital doesn’t know that). York set hospitals administer vaccines, hospital administrators slowed everything snails pace hospitals vaccinate outside priority guidelines hit fraud charges massive fines. find hard believe next 12 months, according link, we'll 40% population vaccinated.

I also find hard believe peak vaccination rate 1.2mn per day. think people area even realize police department first responders refusing take vaccines reserved them. course, first responders refusing wear masks entire pandemic. really guess surprised all. There’s plenty supply, hospitals aren’t giving out. Several states around 70% vaccines delivered haven’t used. hate trump average person seriously man? don’t wear mask anymore, long hunker home use contactless delivery services mask requirements end.

But seriously still wear mask (or stay home) figure app card something prove took vaccine.

Plus get 2 shots, takes weeks get full effect. US state lowest number Covid deaths Hawaii, 204 deaths per million. state US lower death per million rate world average. 

So even US, remote island easy control borders huge advantage. Hey boss, freezer broke. Luckily couple hundred friends, various celebrities, actors sports stars outside.

Desk jobs aren’t grocery stores aren’t daycares, aren’t nursing homes, etc etc. job inherent risk: virus zero chance killing human race, covid even leading cause death United States 2020 ""Apparent lack solidarity Western Countries"", ""pro Russian leader stoking flames"", derogatory terms Chinese Russian vaccines. absolutely consideration crazy idea perhaps EU give fuck countries EU. sort criticism, matter valid well constructed, work paid russian trolls.

Thank pointing out.  doubt people long term issues viral infection like happened viral infections. dispute number. think good percentage people health issues like anxiety, depression, etc. similar health complications attribute long covid. wish could find articles I've seen several person says COVID March (no positive test sick) long COVID...they usually antibodies. people suspect less long COVID mental issues. absolutely right choice autonomy. employers right let work medical setting put residents risk. know, but, know. hate censorship. point I'd like take global publicity tour stand side government buildings flipping off.

I’m glad he’s ok. mom got whooping cough outbreak 5 years ago stopped putting pertussis booster tetanus, even though immunity wears off. always wondered took pertussis out, I’m guessing it’s reactions. It’s back now. sounds like you’re saying currently circulating antibodies protect actual infection. long lasting antibodies impossible. Plus antibodies create severe infection. 

Given there’s sure fire way protect someone severe COVID then, shape public policy? developing vaccines? also insomnia sleep breath properly... lean forward try breath even yawn... working time...

I feel SOB coming throat (trachea think).
When want big inspiration air get blocked inside throat come through. feeling like run lot get breathless can't catch breath blocked... happening me. first months also felt something throat add ""clear it"" lot especially failed catch breath... know makes sens you?

It's weeks feel bit better inconfort still (whenever walk talk lot... even 10 minutes walk make breathless even house cleaning...)

I 2 weeks holidays festive period think resting helped me. live UK entering lockdown number 3 hope keep getting better resting... still feel SOB leave :( weird...

Is SOB comes throat well?

And yes antibodies test way late. September doctor already told antibodies test probably late. 

I research looks like people like us long symptoms ones hospital.

Who said didn't? incomplete information. hospital administrators claiming oxygen shortage, also fining nurse work oxygen shortage. know is, don;t know whole story. alarms would sound

I watched video heard alarms. also saw rushed camera work tell going enough time replenish long ran out

Youi know, possible literally oxygen. Like, medical supply company ran oxygen week ago hospital trying get *region* shortage.

Exactly!

In years past, spouse used get flu vaccine via one work drives tech companies fond of. fill form upfront determine whether ever allergic reaction. so, told administer flu vaccine equipped deal emergency due adverse reaction.

Even coronavirus, [here's 9 months 5 Funny mortality equal countries too.. 

And abolished flu! Magic. Believe not, different ways fight pandemic. Nordic countries barely lockdowns either, also quite late masks. Yet, they're best performing countries Europe. mean measures. last sentence crap 1000% though.

I thinking scenario containment measures lockdowns insufficient, 1st wave Spanish flu.

If remember correctly, Covid killed 0.6% population Bergamo, Italy, Spring. outbreak stopped hard lockdown, otherwise would died. take 0.6% world population, easily reach Spanish flu territory, even though 50% population Bergamo infected. 

I think possible distinguish transmissibility virus mortality pandemic. Increased transmissibility invariably mean deaths. Suicidal behaviour angsty teens; gets glossed ""angry outbursts"", ""laziness"", ""selfishness"" ""emotionally distant""; noticeable difference symptoms metal illness (chronic acute) willful choice.

With New Case positivity rate check County Report true testing number Negatives found County report stated "" counts include number people department received PCR antigen laboratory results day. percent number people test positive first time divided people tested day, excluding people previously tested positive."" add 17,370+120,621=137,991 17,370/137,991=12.59% Calculation version similar different positive numbers 17,783+120,621=138,404 17,783/138,404=12.85%. second point, would favor killing citizens illegal immigrants crowding hospitals. came choice, last bed always go citizen. 

As first point, believe situation longer. Vaccines outpace hypothetical. choice giving mother shot, giving illegal immigrant shot *hopes* spread mother - hard choose. Sorry... US items covered here. Universal insurance pretty much exists here. doesn’t set good president it? really don’t understand awards things... well kinda tech stuff frequent... like “thank you’s” guess. received many bizarre awards coronavirus thread make head explode categories people choose... 

I hope it’s it’s people lazy pick low value thing. 

now mods “hiding” awards like this... probably good thing. Although I’m sure people would upset interpretation. Ha Generate antibodies, case severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, may act inflammatory cells. 

Data indicates need decent titers circulating antibodies start prevent reinfection. Waiting B cells response going prevent least base level reinfection. Given SARS-CoV-2 downregulates type IFN responses, small infection turn large infection quickly. could also legal issue mandating vaccine authorized FDA emergency use authorization. I’m expert could also liability legal issue employer consider well.

I would prefer mandated medical exception it’s definitely easy. Houston Harris County school districts done much better job taking seriously. go grocery store drug store neighborhood (Northside) everyone always masked up. I’ve gone Montgomery County I’ve stopped gas pretty much everyone going store maskless.  think many cases reported yet. Maybe people get test although wanted, many symptomatic cases without tests, would heard, we? 

I think lost lot cases would asymptomatic doubt cases contagious, that's viruses work. IMO higher rate positive tests among fewer actual tests totally consistent testing fewer ""optional"" cases.

That said, fucking shame government still refuses even consider effective quantitative monitoring. fewer cameras, fast anonymous antigen tests public spaces, canalisation monitoring random representative tests much one could lift curtain get real understanding spread. officials run one stupid lockdown ... read bill New York trying pass? It’s disturbing. Essentially gives right detain anyone isolation 3+ days, forcibly test people, without cause claim detainee potentially came contact carrier covid. point become much? willing allow police officer detain reason building potential carrier? Still Number one!

And that's US fudging numbers! It’s government pretending care. look back first started, government hid loads deaths nursing homes months. Spain ( 99% sure Spain ), nursing home abandoned. Everyone left die. did. don’t think there’s much difference first world countries I’m afraid. Thanks letting know, realised unclear being. Added edit. reading article day.  Imagine believing ""Well ain't never seen germs. must fake!"" Illinois moving 65+ soon. I’m tearing seeing photo nurse 😭 AZ voted blue everyone Nowhere article anyone suggest present evidence single-dose immunization worse immunization. basically cautious suggestion since single-dosers lower antibody titers twice-dosers expect less protected twice-dosers. expected way, added concern antibodies produced vaccine could weaker South African strain common strain, whether one two doses. Ah okay yes thank helps. Sorry going through! Party. Animals. coma ventilator covid know survived sure fucking hope immunity lasts years D: Maybe shut travel UK. that? it’s 10 every 1million? I’m taking vaccine They'd could convince COVID primarily spread black people... choosing believe tracking reporting problem, nearly bad seems.

Illinois updated numbers days, surely ton people getting vaccinated. offering get keep job? Happened friend mine California, LA. lost taste smell mild dry cough that's it. Milder cold quarantine 14 days home ( 52-53 years old think?) 


He told 2 days ago senses coming back now. corollary, way public health restrictions unassailable they're instituted ""experts,"" public policy making completely insulated volatile oft-irrational public sentiment. treatment prevention method. vaccine also guards catching certain. vaccine probably stops spread anyway care GO! 10 minutes confined space pre-symptomatic 10 minutes long. Especially new UK variant, there's greater chance infected either pre-symptomatic asymptomatic. need wait least 3 days get PCR test. make ""minor"". Sorry don’t really understand you’re saying Blaming anyone - American trait too? got mine day. hype expecting feel sick. minor muscle fatigue hour nothing else happened. Rather uneventful. Well except CIA van follows around.  mutation covid-19 one we're talking about. Covid 19 mutating entire time, proteins spike mutations happen insignificantly.

Basically mutation protein spike concerned might really matter viral load much different transmission rate potentially much higher still going get significantly increased mortality rate.

I mean, lot ways mortality covid-19 never main problem, rather infectiousness get another boost infectiousness probably worse.

I think could choose 70% increase mortality 70% increase infectiousness would actually better mortality since recovered people still potentially facing long-term symptoms well there's whole fact infectiousness shuts society, mortality unless mortality low insignificant.

Getting mortality information new variant going take quite bit time determining infectiousness know test significantly longer time find prognosis patient. awful Canada’s top response resulted 27 times many extra deaths Covid deaths 45 age bracket. Yes, inside nostril way there. That's said ""major portion"" spent full lockdown, all. Well zero trust corporations. sure seen corporations knowingly hid information regarding sorts side effects. Plenty documentaries regarding that. fact America sue amount want. However, vaccine agreements limit liability manufacturers. Also, vaccines available public quickly, usually years. least America authorized emergency use current approved use outside that. It’s complicated say least. really money that's driving this. probably 80% related educational experience, children learn best person. well developed adult take online courses

1. Kids computers mix. Remember computer classes kid often e-mail, shockwave games, Youtube things open parallel? Kids get distracted. classroom, teachers put end note-passing distractions, can't home.
2. Children need interact children learn 'social interactions.' narrow time window children develop these, similar children really learn language (easily) certain age, gets significantly harder
3. People bottom income technical disadvantage. might great computers high-speed internet connections
4. Children well going get remedial aid need. Normally someone struggling question, teacher walk sit 3-5 mins instantaneous tutoring. alot harder Zoom - can't easily create side chat rooms offer immediate 1-on-1 support. course, many kids want look stupid raise hands get called front everyone. 
5. also much harder buddy someone exercise option virtually person. think gives less echo chamber allowing people give positive feedback.

It's easy prove circumstances, immunity lasts years. scientist says, ""Were confident immunity last several years,"" interpret as, ""Immunity lasts several years."" FUCK WHO

I FUCKING HATE THEM, INCOMPETENCE COST THOUSANDS LIVES anyone know Worldometers Virginia never updates data cases recovered? little frusturating, would nice know bad actual situation better judge visit family. go data page, almost noone gets VA ever recovers.... remember child people older used tell believe everything seen internet it’s trying convince mother, uncles aunts stop believing random stuff hear about. 

Thankfully mother wasn’t today took first dose! Remindme! Two years Good them. I’m sure block alone double that, yet nothing done. Why? Everyone borders therefore ability control. acted early epidemic timeline prevent seeding. countries managed avoid deaths widespread infection too. Taiwan. 24million. lockdown. 7 deaths. Again, acted extremely fast, took seriously. Prevented seeding test trace got through. Masks available. beginning January  completley pointless. prevents 100% hospitilisations due covid Travelled Arizona summer year. Packed bars, complete disregard masks, tons tourism. 

As impacting region badly: desert climate. Cold, dry, dusty severely weakens body's ability fight infection lungs causes bunch coughing/sneezing. harsh sunlight summers likely helped disinfect keep transmission down, winter advantage anymore. number 850! Originally 600, 800, 850! number next? Phase three trials cancer drugs may 300 participants. Sometimes scaling studies massive numbers people prevents getting really look details studying. passes peer review, really says something. really hope capable countries start sequencing every single sample sharing one central database things tracked analyzed. technology clearly exists Taiwan 25 million people, way New Zealand, also nearly Covid free. Nah. vaccines plentiful enough short order vaccinate citizens first, rest world second. Although said difficult determine much spike due increased infectivity variant vs increased mixing holidays. Corrupt + Stupid = American saving lives US citizens

Dumbass. Leaving high transmission risk undocumented immigrants unvaccinated kill US citizens. means willing sacrifice family feel self-righteousness giving free medication illegal.

If really solely saving US citizen lives would want vaccinate anyone expected contact US citizen. That's I'm saying, need asymptomatic carrier, since first symptomatic carrier worked frozen imports. could first case second outbreak. Get yourself.

I personally find headline hard understand. Me, brother, two sisters, mum girlfriend tested positive coronavirus back last spring.

People fought hard believe virus possibly worse order argue people deny Covid threat rationalise defensive behaviours towards refuse accept evidence contrary.

This study hugely popular welcomed good news. Instead, hardly makes front page fit prevailing narrative. now, message simply know therefore cannot assume immunity post infection. Like Japanese soldiers abandoned desert island war ended, people vehemently insist war over- still can't sure immunity last. true- can't 100% certain, order live life base assumptions evidence. evidence overwhelmingly immunity, instances contrary vanishingly small.

Finally defence study, understanding symptomatic reinfection prevented. means fact reinfected, unlikely become sick. 

Does mean cannot die sick infected second time? Well unless asymptomatically infected infers immortality, no, course not. fact deaths occurring hospital coronavirus dying illnesses, hence high rate deaths comorbidities. Covid kills, absolutely. SARS-cov-2 equally infect someone 5 hours left live virtually impact health still counted death covid. UK death within 28 days positive test counted stats.

Its early days, science coming years today. fear never glorified hope opinion.  absolutely compare them. Hawaii could done exactly NZ but.... populated Americans VIC here: least got doughnut today! sound like understand population density. densely populated towns within NZ. can't compare towns countries. 

Bottom line NZ actually complied severe lockdown orders, continue needed. downvote?

And I'm conspiracy nut thinks undercounting/not labeling deaths Covid use argument. matter, month it'll true either way. think lack ability present compelling way helps policy remind need middlemen science reporting.

I allowed present certain data readily derived publicly available information intuition. NDAs prevent getting highly finding reinfections literally job. biases talk believe it’s common important. It’s see.

It's bias. bias believing reinfection less common intuition would lead logical person conclude. instance, basing reinfection rates number ""confirmed"" reinfections without taking account lack genetic material actually run RNA-Seq confirm it. would think nearly everybody scientific community believes knowing reinfection rates disease caused havoc globally year something that's important know. say “7% documented infections don’t develop antibodies means reinfection happens need prepare everything goes it” say “it’s likely 93% cases develop antibodies protected least 3 months”.

The difference number (7%) always going standard. 93% may may standard due waning immunity. goal ending pandemic without vaccine escape (which South Africa may already messed up). start getting habit saying, ""Oh, infected once, there's good chance may able get again,"" people may infected may start let guard lead reinfection. Every single reinfection potential lead another mutation (maybe even due selective pressure delayed humoral response). kind like people running around months calculating population mortality rate virus rather IFR, CFR, completed case mortality rate claiming virus 99.98% survivability rate completely wrong. one person died US, population mortality rate 1 328 million (99.9999996%). Now, we've already killed 0.11% population clear end sight current wave. still, people continue repeat 99.98% survivability rate blue face need vent. I'd rather lay things way makes known against.

New records 
California posted new single-day record coronavirus cases Monday, logging 74,000, according [a Times tally local health agencies. 
That 11% higher previous record, 66,726 cases registered Dec. 28. state averaging 37,000 cases day last week, [high mid-December. situation still far worse beginning December, 14,000 cases day recorded. 
California also posted sixth-highest daily tally COVID-19 deaths Monday: 379. raised average number deaths last week 353 day, highest yet. yeah ok well going memory found years ago would 15th year teaching may used data vaguely remember years ago. anyway 87 k much chicago main point especially children. Both. Phase IV clinical monitoring taking place whether want admit not. attempting claim magic knowledge well known publicly discussed data. medical facility CHOICE?

It’s FDA approved vaccine. It’s allowed emergency use authorization. approved, medical workers probably required get like vaccine. ridiculous. Coronavirus lock downs much bigger threat humanity coronavirus due risk destroying economy unleashing unforeseen title wave conflict.

Even 50% people 60 died, 10% every one else died, Coronavirus real ""threat humanity"". anything case coronavirus would probably help humanity long run.

I'm advocating however, saying.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess could argue coronavirus could cause us lose ""humanity"" becoming selfish barbarians, refuse work together, try steal elections, take frustrations innocent small businesses riots, hoard vaccines, try use tragedy personal gain, etc. dead wrong. Veterinarians? provide healthcare animals... stepdad way, saying get vaccine, mom convinced would worth it.

He also wanted go church person, able convince keeping watching services streaming home.

Given stepdad 70s, million co-morbidities, I'm glad able influence him. Straight up. I’m honestly sure people freaking this. type people likely would “allowed die” ones already basically dead. Sure could kept “alive”for vent outcome likely same. likely won’t ever wake aware again.

If I’m cold, like, let go. Wherever I’m going going, I’m already LOL Well people bring drug Iv*rmectin many studies show helps, ""not enough n="" ""anecdotal evicence"" ""studies done poor countries, must fake"".

Yet one single nurse vaccinates well vaccination that's scientific proof vaccine safe. think explanation around summer reporting daily deaths takes much resource time doctors something like that. could wrong, remember vaguely. hope pick pace vaccinating Americans. Free charge. number translates 8.3% country's population. 
The currently offered vaccines Pfizer's sinopharm. 
The vaccines free cost compulsory moment. Though starting today, government employees longer get free covid-19 test every 2 weeks forced pay decide take vaccine. 
The country planning vaccinate 50% population end Q1. great teachers. It’s 10 13 year olds see distance learning them, peers. It’s awful. 13 year olds assignments can’t even figure technology issues. Imagine parents aren’t college grad native English speakers. lot lost translation.

You've buried apparently consider important information rant got downvoted see it. downvotes mine.

In case, assumed trying say something weren't, that's me, apologize.

Edit: also could answered initial question. asked ""Are saying \_\_\_\_\_?"" could said ""No"" instead going press releases Fauci. logistical hurdles big problem rn what? COVID19 hoax anymlre? I'm glad Governor DeathSentence came sense kill slightly less people daddy Trump. Floridians deserve better.  Exactly. Reduce contacts minimum. Work home possible. Stay home symptoms. Keep distance public. Avoid crowds. Wash hands. skip turns, suspend without pay vaccinated.

China US's death rate, would million dead. meant Americans back normal bad thing. ignoring virus Jeez, one sentence? much article... still get 2 senators 3 reps :(   Thats tragedy. Really hope stories start popping up, panic roof. understand 70% effective. Wroooooong applies it’s human human transmission. Human animal, animal animal (like mink cat), animal human dramatically speed mutation rate. likely hiding something, likely fault. I've always looked initial, incredibly ferocious response (welding people apartments, fumigating city blocks, etc) virus (and us) knew little likely similar SARS, wonder perhaps knew let contagious deadly was. Hey, worries! prepared understanding phrase corrected, happened right time.  least California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia. That's confirmed.

It's likely every state point, though. allow American capitalist economy keep churning destabilizing countries siphoning resources know mean. Another consideration people never really get thing. say immunocompromised patients churn viruses much longer 7 days. Even locked every single person room month, 2 months even, rare exceptions rule would still shedding virus I'm going latter. Let's win war defeat corona all. Haha. definitely front line flu shots “ran out”. want live shitstorm (but time shit hurricane) attended public school...do recall teachers motivated? don't. great job, schools germ factories. Survivability actually 97.83% based globally reported cases. I'm sure people keep coming 99% I'm seeing time. makes nice tight talking point? Get redefining. They’re called “conspiracy theorists”, “conspiracy fantasists”.

You made BS explain everyone world conspiracy theorist, lmao. chicken egg scenario, acted wrong first? 


Except scenario answer easy. China started coronavirus tried cover up.  


 
So yeah think China releasing coronavirus covering up, caused US say China released coronavirus covered up. 


 
Also post Opinion article claim ""The US openly accusing Chinese created virus lab."" opinion article labelled such.  


I bet allowed chinese officials write articles opinion US, offensive un-educated things would said. Wearing mask hard /s It... does. wrong

Despite objectively wrong think doctors dismissive women men? proven mountain statistical muh anecdote! right. mainly pointing lack choice. took 4 daus get test results. last days vacation tests dropped lot 😅

I know you’re sarcastic however. same. early February, several days could barely breathe all. Prior that, running 4-5 miles day 5 days week. Since stopped running seems requires lot breathe ever before. Always tired. Never got tested officially acknowledged USA. Oh easy mode along??  far..... Depends. We’re (Taiwan) reliant international tourism anyway; one reasons we’re well never really large numbers American/European tourists (Too small place 12+ hr flight. Admit it, loads guys confuse Taiwan Thailand). Much economy running normal right bit hit last spring; course global supply chain problems such. tourism industry suffered course they’ve turned domestic travel stay afloat. American living SK, I'm really fucking happy rather back home. LA hospital system life support. isn’t great covid noted bad news oxygen situation necessarily. could clear virus mostly innate immunity IgA response (which routinely measured) dose low enough. average american probably even know mRNA happens uk resident flys say NK Vietnam?  they’re not. 7 day average new cases per day increased two weeks.

In case tho China definitely hiding shit. What’s wrong mechanical engineer?  I’ve seen one. It’s classic. evidence vaccine prevents transmission? That's hope, know. I’ve learned nurses dumb. rigor schools outside universities big. It’s mainly ones without bsn turning down. Yes please.

&amp;#x200B;

they're also getting stadiums many details vaccine distribution coming months yet known, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Wednesday Facebook Live appearance current public testing sites like Raymond James Stadium Lee Davis Neighborhood Services Center 22nd Street Tampa would probably converted vaccine distribution centers upon availability. sites like may wait.  Yes, no. would also interested hearing actual, substantive explanation appear hell bent going exact order inane tier system cost vaccines spoil. think might expecting many thought responses. Nope, people heard loud clear said people didn’t need wear masks back March. exactly point. 

Newson doesnt believe lockdowns. rules enacted order called murderer. Period. 

Political posturing. 

But practice anything blatantly obvious, like going restaurant. let kids infect other, teachers, immediate family members, anyone else unfortunate enough encounter bc 'lacking social interaction'? Lol Gave upvote UV lighting.  idea taking long authorize entry?  work that, wonder number would need make people respond enthusiastically en masse.

Like much Karens secretly get vaccinated spout anti-vax propaganda Facebook? crazy side family believe pandemic? kooky conspiracy theorists? change minds, change actions. price. radical suggestion pay it.

I'd pay get bonus socially conscious responsible people. could prevent 80% hospitalizations vaccinating less 20% population. understand push vaccinating healthcare workers first. Personally, 4 nurses (25-35 years old) family working directly Covid patients almost 9 months. received first dose. 4 90+ year olds family idea get able leave homes again. doesn’t makes sense.  ""They've gone plaid!"" Right fuckface. Masks working should. others wore masks test positive? shit going happen fighting pointless.

If actually get 100m doses distributed Q1 really going matter someone paid wad cash move month. vulnerable germany hopefully vaccinated first quarter, still enough better nothing. I’m attacking stringent. I’m attacking following it’s rules. Telemedicine doctors healthcare professionals risk. 

I personally think simplify whole process simply vaccinate everyone 70 (or 75). immediately reduce hospitalisations death. open wider. 

There vaccines, sitting freezers. Yet Texas, half supply bogged delays overly complicated processes. FFS people understand cost living?

A local district near full person 4 months, 6k students. total 15 cases. 1 hospitalized staff faculty member. wish was.  There's many suggestions:

* half dose first second dose
* one dose only
* one dose delayed second dose (as long 3-4 months)
* use doses available first dose many people possible second dose available.
* mix manufacturer first second dose (i.e. Pfizer first dose, Moderna second) depending availabililty

Despite there's one regimen approved. Two shots fixed dosage drug company 21 days 28 days apart. sure alternatives even talked considered. Doses available. needs managed better. Much better. wish was. need 3 million day catch WWI participants kept spread Spanish flu secret compromise military operations. That's possible implement containment lockdowns 1st wave. can't fight war lockdowns. That's able spread rapidly narrow crowded space trenches troop transports.

By time 2nd wave spread widely mutated become deadly. 

Without containment measures lockdowns, Covid would widespread Spanish flu. Due wider spread would also mutated more, increasing transmission and/or fatality. That's lowest score I've seen get awarded silver medal lol Support twoops? Lots money overseas die whole lot nothingness despair get back, perfect.

Everyone’s expert days. 21-28 days. could pull first 600 doses short period, week easily. think most, Cases, especially unknown community transmission done via aerosol, totally agree want things like norovirus covid, pinkeye covid, common cold/ flu covid, really believe possible someone newly Covid positive touching nose, mouth eyes, touching surface, someone Covid negative coming along touching surface touching nose, mouth eyes caused transmission. likely path, always happen, reason longer supposed shake hands, plus extra surface. That's really correct, see similar curves countries. Sweden assigns deaths correct date instead counting daily reported deaths. even know alert 1-5, tiers accompanying rules seems jazzed ALERT LEVEL 5 nowhere.

Threat terror uk traffic light system gets worse might need whole new system instead alert one. could piggyback US one, Deathcon 1-5

(I say last part jest, stay safe everyone) even reason Americans wear masks avoid gatherings? 52% figure includes data vaccine takes effect, IE days 1-10, exclude second dose given rises close 90%.

The UK actually care much symptomatic covid efficacy either, care effect keeping hospital dying certainly higher symptomatic efficacy.

The UK scientists explained reasoning recent press conference. confident Pfizer AZ vaccine dose 1 provides least 50% effectiveness keeping hospital dying 12 week period lower bound justifies decision double number people getting first doses.

It's also complete gamble think is. We've studied vaccines lots data vaccines every aspect. sure risk 50/50 gamble like people think. one found solution!

Brilliant! Bunch selfish, spoiled brats. Sociopaths. Sounds like know count 3 Thank you. Thanks experts. life shall change way.

Thank Actually user sub works part covid immunity team said there’s reason believe covid immunity best 93% effective people issues seroconverting like etc 

So basically take vaccine never promised specific date

He said somewhere within window corner would turned specific things reliable schedule probably individual British hospitals vaccinated employees France. fired.

Preferably cannon. read, finish article? 

Of course did. researched doesn’t take away terrible things happening day

Yeah, nothing would blip NBC evening news reported correctly. best vaccine, cheapest, fastest vaccine deploy side effects. republicans like veterans they’re conservative props. don’t actually care veterans, people like dad horrible PTSD hey, doesn’t like trump could care less, right? Hopefully. banned r/coronavirus spreading dangerous misinformation Yes, lockdown early hard, mainly politics deferred science. island, big tourist destination normally whole shitload international flights coming in. quite tourists got ""trapped"" here, quite happily staying on.

We covid scares every then, lapse managed isolation returning kiwis, mostly back normal. actually conversation I’ve lot people circle. Yes think people dying good idea, including friends family. would suck anybody knew died this. 

However think everybody agree human population needs reduced, also think everybody could agree would suck they’re family friends die. 

Ideally, could let virus it’s thing good chunk people died better race, however would really support knowing closest could die? know would not. 

I think way virus behaves overhyped politicians media outlets, way keeping us people scared leaving power hands. It’s crime go work lmao Yes absolutely. change next weeks we'll shortage vaccines. least going reserve half doses second shot (which absolutely okay according Drosten) they'll get 6 shots vaccine bottle instead 5. initial 1.3 mio doses end vaccinating 1.6 mio people instead 650.000. Well that's fucking tremendous supposed wake call flag waving folks far right negligent stopping spread covid 19. point thousand layers deep conservative fantasy world inception think latest frying pan across face going disturb slumber one iota. Yeah.

But doesn’t matter.

It’s shitty platform pandemic.

And...

There’s one man military deploying “spare” doctors nurses across country months now. LA city shallow selfish people. Shouldn’t easier vaccinate 8,000,000 people 10 square miles, opposed 2,000,000 20,000 square miles?

I’m talking vaccines per capita, obviously. Higher outdoors summer, higher indoors racist call massacre. delusional. feel demonstration tier system entirely necessary. availability doses bottle neck expected be. seems like we'll hundred million doses within next month two. think need rationing occupation way now. absurd exemptions fucked rollout vaccines, Germany really shitshow right now. Thats embarassing. “Fuck nursing homes, want vaccine now!” staff MD RNs? think aren’t thinking that? think treating covid patients running ragged since March?

Pharmacists practical group, aren’t enough either. last couple weeks 46 states approved pharmacy technicians receive additional training approved deliver covid vaccinations. training 10 hours additional hours top busiest time year pharmacy. State boards approved techs lower level people ages ago could assist larger settings. problem aren’t enough people qualified jabbing, it’s easy get people qualified. Yes, get shots arms willing recipients. We'll never get done labor deserving get today vs next week vs next month. Like would found anything anyway. year. incriminating evidence likely burned dead. Fascinating article way. 100% worth reading even you’re skeptical title. Apparently small mind world. You’ve never seen people lived multiple countries. get this.. even born South Africa 🤯
Do know is? sounds correct really doubt actually is. that? find general people really raise military service unless discussion work history. article video supporting viewpoint basically China supports

Because China's telling truth, proof (and mean evidence, mean *proof*) want see it.

The fact mainstream media still loves talk ""Tiananmen Square massacre"" shows deep Sinophobia runs Western journalism, Western government, Western culture. local transmission much canada time, lock down. 360k* So... immediately then. really dont know trying say wasnt meant deployed population wide. 

I've reviewed primary source material, listened editor-in-chief NEJM's analysis data front FDA, responses study's PI.

They explicitly excluded people severe allergies (not specific, claim) enrolled age cohorts non-representative population currently receiving vaccine. reasoning originally intended vaccine deployed limited population (health care providers) expect deployed population-wide stage research. CDC pushed that.

Anaphylaxis generally occurs swiftly exposure, also take hours, sometimes 24 hours, occur. stated earlier, believe call allergist. allergist, basing information on? opinion, common-sense, read media? two children suffer nut allergies deep dive topic, accompanied office food challenges, lengthy conversations doctors office regarding limits knowledge regarding allergies, interactions one's environment, utility epi pens (or lack thereof) acute emergency. short version epi pens get hospital, substitutes treatment subsequent observation required fully assess someone woods.

Again, read primary source material. representative sample 70 year old people enrolled study can't say intended 70+ year old carefully says (and Seriously it’s massive national security threat. used leverage future disputes. Seems pretty standard across country. 40-60% healthcare workers refusing vaccine we’re fat, don’t care virus, running masks, ventilators, oxygen tanks. also why. “Up to” Right? Like know deserve get ahead priority groups, put standby. eligible months change supply distribution, damn want get with. one tell us, ""No"" Sounds good 👏🏼 hopefully CA next **Additional links source article.**

E.g. = Example given

I.e. = words think one thing make difference well-qualified people put place run federal agencies related response virus. current administration seems chosen people deliberately anti-government run funded subverted them. government, science, health care institutions imperfect needed time like this.

The 2nd important thing IMHO communication public. seeing lot concerned people left devices make decisions state even county neighborhood level. leadership guidelines importantly almost flow information. People get information virus vaccine Facebook. instead getting government experts. current administration seems taken delight eliminating normal sources information dissemination public replaced one Twitter account.

The new white house hold regular press briefings help inform align people common goals. also touch governors mayors large cities around country help get need use federal resources so.

Leadership matters. China really hard lockdown outside Hubei. parts like Guangdong got away lockdown light Germany's even lighter. people sub also clue European countries done, fair. mean, reading things like ""they lockdown hard enough"" makes blood boil. Eh, saying made big difference nothing cut dry. right messaging combined different approach supporting economy/working people would produced much better results, sure, especially summer. Much like Europe rest world though, think US ever position completely stamp like NZ, Taiwan even China. That’ll teach ‘em! also related pandemic terms scope severity, though.

Lot people time energy protest 2019. EMTs would giving injections regularly already? probably busy taken emt duties Lol also absolutely easier control spread isolated countries. That's something sub fails accept reason. Ok, try parent 9th 12th grader... Lucky, sucks America. Still full lockdown. 10 months. get don’t like Trump, countries similar difficulties dealing COVID. Oh. You’re playing game dipshit gotcha. I’ll choose ignore you. That’s article says all.  think troubles 'easy' groups. experts cautioned people assume vaccine impact spread, it’s reasonable assume reduce transmission. It’s vaccines aren’t tested that, stopping people getting sick. scientists can’t say sure specific vaccines stop spread. ""15 days"" Le Guludec, head France's medical regulator, said still insufficient data approve AstraZeneca vaccine developed Oxford University AstraZeneca.  prefer wait another 15 days necessary data need safety efficacy,"" Le Guludec told BFM TV.

[Archive \[French vaccination campaign 'state scandal' 500 receive jabs - Telegraph 4^(th) January\] Planning eventually get vaccine doesn’t deter Covid, unfortunately. politicians wait push schools open teachers actually vaccinated. Pushing open times stupid hypocritical. that, “affluent” individuals across globe traveling US vaccinated. lol, sorry, feel pain benefit geographical isolation along advantage relatively small country compared somewhere like Australia. Getting shops movement people doesn’t help stop transmission though Loneliness high schools colleges I'm familiar case case. planning opening backing cases rising again. offering part time on-site like 2 days week certain classes.

It’s good DeSantis this, don’t think odds Florida’s favor right now. like learned nothing watching Italy go last March.

We really stupid US. don’t think anyone said it’s blown proportion. Keep public pressure. cant use welding oxygen?  mean person check ups? Districts send police department homes students fall grid wellness checks. 2/3rds vaccine California sitting freezers. Wtf going on? Newsom incompetent. People need vaccines now. People dying California knew vaccine coming yet nothing prepare. need giving mass vaccinations people Unless AZ proven “around level” mRNA vaccines don’t see chance approved.

I got first dose Saturday, standing line NYC hospital, doctors nurses line talking 2nd dose. please provide source that? interesting see economists come coming years. Comparing New Zealand rest world

And people comparing America ""how act pandamic"" reddit man. Evidence matter. bad intuition snap judgements based popular sentiment. want play devils advocate here, want point Vietnam Liberia probably accurate numbers. like trusting China? mention Liberia especially Africa reported low numbers overall right (besides SA). 

As Finland, comparing completely irrelevant. really understand would compare Finland considering consistent trade EU daily basis. extreme symptoms like stokes brain damage extremely rare. Yes scary 1% people get sick virus tiny minority people get crazy symptoms. make headlines rare. Something drastic already happened, effective vaccine available public. need ride next 6 months everyone gets vaccinated. How? pretty straight forward me.  Biden's comment *at current pace vaccinations*, would take years vaccinate everyone country. based slow pace initial rollout simple math. vaccinate 100,000 per day population 330 million adds 9 years.

His point need go faster think will. flu vaccine given 1-2 million people per day nationwide lot better. want make political current administration seems completely checked leadership. Hopefully change shortly. They're saying take lot precautions essential—they expect people leave home reason. OP: post incredibly outdated article doesn’t even address question poses? good news. It’s headline may even true April. I'd put strong money 2nd COVID stimulus bill includes $2k relief checks money hospitals, state/local governments, vaccine distribution.

Vigilantes better criminals chase. reason civilians stay law enforcement. takes 1 moron f.. up. Police investigators training avoiding mistakes like this. rocket grade liquid oxygen used hospitals? know different/less pure medical grade, rocket industry seem suffering liquid oxygen shortage.

From quick Google search: 

* 1 liter liquid oxygen (LOX) = ~860 liters gaseous oxygen (GOX). [[1]](http://asmameeting.org/asma2013_mp/pdfs/asma2013_present_138.pdf)
* Let's assume rocket uses roughly 250 000 liters LOX. (It's 
a bit let's assume worse version.) means every load LOX rocket launch could make 215 000 000 liters GOX. 
* 10 liters per minute recommended oxygen flow per one hospital bed. means single load LOX rocket launch could support 1066 patients two weeks. go grocery stores send kids schools.

Taiwan went second wave, responded shutting Christmas markets New Years concerts. reinstituted temperature checks entering shopping malls strict limits tourist areas. result, second wave ended 1 total cases. People keep using island argument clue countries actually doing. Unless I'm wrong, counted least 6 beds video.  Yeah shit I'm exact boat. sit doom scroll day play video games. still working office home way pre-pandemic. Shit's rough.  Probably little longer reasons. 

1. still unclear much vaccine reduces transmission. likely reduce transmission 95% reduction 60%? 50% reduction, still may require vaccinated wear masks. significant portion population vaccinated would wise continue wear masks. 

2. percent people vaccinated currently small relative percent people would claim immune/vaccinated get wearing mask. Many places find worth try verify vaccination yet. large fraction population vaccinated issue smaller. Yes, vaccine someone's arm better one sitting freezer.

Okay show country similar US handled covid amazingly Well April written, know why... Populations:

Switzerland: 8.6M
Hungary: 9.6M
Austria: 9M
Italy: 60M
Bulgaria: 6.9M

Israel: 9.1M
Czech Republic: 10.7M

*USA: 332M*

I've said half year per-capita comparisons useful populations within 1 order magnitude. Meaning US compared good faith countries population least 33M... *maybe* 10M, depending definition ""order magnitude"" one uses.

In words, *only* country list compare good faith Italy, maybe Czech Republic. It’s also tiny island population 4.5 m.

For comparison US 37 x bigger per land mass. island. NZ population comparable Louisiana. 

Very happy course. Less death good thing. people saying “Why can’t US like NZ?” It’s logical comparison. that's problem. Wait might need medical attention day someone bought space front you.
You're clearly someone experience something understand it. think make good points. People think New Zealand Taiwan applicable continental Europe US also... you’re right I’m nearly sure it’s serious, care explain think that? staffed ghost Florence nightingale Damn, must frustrating paid taxes made contributions society, therefore get vaccines sooner. People mooch welfare put back line.  Teachers best people, really embarrassed 7th grade myself, puberty crazy...

Hopefully students get infected... Y’all keep blaming tourists tourists don’t protest lockdown indoor shopping mall. I’m pretty sure locals following public health guidance irrespective tourists (which limited since things aren’t supposed open open it’s locals bringing tourists in) SoCal would like NorCal  Yeah, physical borders EU either (well, Schengen co), like said comment, north Finland similar, helped fact maybe ""only"" 20 roads area sparsely populated. might feasible option there's pandemic can't make vaccine for. Obviously, setting border fence whatever make sense, checkpoints main highways, aerial control, fines breaking find state reside in.. Maybe completely impossible, saying imitate Aus/NZ/Thailand/etc means would that. South African variant better catch percentage age 65? Here's piece good news day. know political sub Democrats took control Senate. (along even Republicans) increasingly critical administrations vaccine rollout. likely measure passed congress least throws money vaccine problem potentially more. also three vaccines way thats kids school shortage teachers, one classes 37(!) kids apparently. probably aftermath Christmas gatherings... looking good aftermath New Year’s celebrations. It’s... frustrating say least. 

People, everywhere: better comply safety measures, sooner we’re mess. realize every time there's article Europe, swarmed Americans going ""WELL AKSUALLY AMERICA WORSE""? I'm sure I'm following point right now.

I look around country see shortage long lines vaccination spots get opened population large.

You put word ""Vaccinations available anyone 70 X park 8:00 4:00 PM"" get line blocking traffic 9 blocks away.

I think current groups easiest. largest nursing homes going draw folks average ""vaccination drive"" (the park example above) line.

And say nothing paperwork involved process. takes age verify eligibility, remove much bureaucratic burden.

I guess bottom line: think vaccinations going slow down, wrong. They're getting faster continue get faster. There's lot reasons that, moving line priority groups going make harder, assure that. important keep tally bad things getting. Yes, Bolsonaro dangerous Trump, care human rights, lives people forests roughly 1/3 brazilians think like bovine friend NishVar here, real chance (a favorite even IMO) reelected 2026.

While Trump rich powerful guy, Bolsonaro represents ""christian values"", meaning: anti-gay, anti-aborption, death endanger lives customs good christians, including criminals also forest-protecting natives ""too lazy actually work"". Bolsonaro also defends rich companies, turns many people really care going many die long jobs created/kept, seen ""job protector"".

Finally, state (Brazil) solid US, still true Democracy, chance makes coup. Polictical opposition scattered can't agree anything amongst them, Justice also historically elitist easily bribed, opposition strong enough currently Globo (our main broadcast company, corrupt least right thing regarding pandemic). ever manages shut Globo, moment Brazil doomed become Venezuela, leave job whatever become refugee somewhere else. someone currently lives Asia, I'm still surprised guys still debating whether wear masks not.

Everyone's wearing masks like 1 year ago.... Spanish Flu caused 50 million deaths worldwide one year despite masks social distancing.

COVID caused 1.87 million deaths worldwide far doubt number gonna higher 3 million pandemic over.

People often mention disingenuous compare COVID Flu...and applies comparing Spanish Flu Ebola way deadlier COVID warrant different type societal response.

If new Ebola strain kept mortality rate contagious COVID, even avid COVID anti-maskers would complying sh\*\*\* pants. part, non-clinical departments administering vaccine. There's plenty clinical staff non-clinical roles. 

It good amount labor pretty doable. bet preferred Chinese virus... exist. wish true, absolutely exist. :( Slave labor v 6.0.   don’t get empathy, gears NYC island nation get vaccine, wear mask anymore, right? behaving exactly 1918-1921 flu pandemic: Brighton’s mask wearing, disinformation, politicizing public health guidance, protesting masks, ... largely identical behaved 100 years ago [archive link anyone trouble accessing article There’s reports covid 19 mutates much slowly, compared flu virus, mutate isn’t far original virus...which easy (relatively) develop vaccine vaccine projected effective mutations seen date. People really aren’t understanding states rights limitations federal government Covid. Fact check: article cites sources mayor Broward. mayor cites sources, saying ""matter math"". provide math. both?

The sucks. China sucks. death toll higher too. Remains seen. really isn’t function vaccines. you’re getting sick you’re spreading it. everyone!! us still careful it’s wearing us seeing half country care. No, *probably* wouldn’t spread it. It’s hasn’t tested that’s purpose vaccine it’s likely prevents spread anyway.

If want roll dice 15% risk, guest. vast majority people US getting vast majority vaccines minimal risk exposure virus vaccine first place, take vaccines even small risk reduction worthwhile.

We buckle seatbelts despite going years without accidents reason. two pilots plane cockpits reason. 

I’d say risk severe case coronavirus higher fatal car crash, yet still buckle up. Go figure. See comment -- ignore lazy ad hominem, author's role martialing facts compelling narrative. facts within article disputed, response seeing appeal \[lack\] authority ad hominem rather good faith engagement strong battery circumstantial evidence disposal. Right healthcare workers refusing vaccine one else getting it. don’t think it’s problem get money hospitals means someone gets vaccinated. vaccinated better less. No, 4-6 weeks according Pfizer.   Correction: American conservative culture. *as Moe Syzslak* Trouble paradise!  Honestly forget lot sub reddit too. Border control/closure one controlling spread disease. hope guys smart enough assume country xxx works, must xxx T.

***Watch learn strategies worked failed, improve there***. use mindset instead, I'm pretty sure would agree tons improve pandemic.

Like learn limiting air travel without mandatory quarantine arrivals testing work. (UK South Africa strain). Definitely something economically powerful country do.

We learn updated stockpile essential supplies, PPE, equipment critical infrastructure based overseas. Definitely something economically powerful country do. (Role models: Taiwan South Korea)

We learn well equipped funded contact tracing departments greatly reduce spread infections. (Role models: South Korea Singapore)

We learn force businesses schools undergo lockdowns, reducing impact economic impact generous social safety nets. (Role models: Australia Canada)

We learn best support health authorities attack them.

Trump, Jared, Ivanka wiped asses tossed recycling bin first day White House. they? local government says it’s considered safe go field museum even mask even eat sandwich indoors 1 hour lunch would safe indoors small classroom attempt teach effectively 8 hour school day? post Holiday reporting. numbers past weeks lot people took time work. Well listen best got. Surprised use tanzanite instead. Wait, saying. sell tanzanite, cruise ships survive? level hysteria sub supported actual facts disease. Yes, real disease seriously affects relatively small known population people. true people (undiagnosed diseases) know fall category. However, mask wearing largely prevents transmission disease. ten kids got sick went mask-less party. would think sub would education doomsday 10 months knowledge disease. people like scared, post write going change that. Expect Tanzania voted favorite country Facebook mommy groups. 🤷‍♀️👩🏻🤷‍♀️👨🏻👩🏻👩👨💁‍♀️ bold strategy cotton, let's see pays Obesity make get disease, makes worse get disease. sure, maybe skinny nations slightly less cases people getting beating without getting test, slightly less, amazingly less testing would show much wide scale infection rate too.. that's definitely what's going on. would surprised eastern asian nations genetic advantages that's first guess looking massive differences cases. I5ve hearing right wing cousin reason pacific nations well sars-cov2 due policies, due instead fact immunity sars-1 outbreaks early 2000s. anyone know there's validity claims? 

Just based cursory look, sars-1 didnt make kind meaningful presence greater populations, think lethal, therefore couldnt account herd immunity sars-cov2. tried to. People still chose travel socialize. 

The issue healthcare providers finite resource. doesn’t matter many ICU beds ventilators are, need people staff them. 

The way prepare prevent this. people still going shopping malls. It’s COVID deniers issue. Everyone explanation whatever social plans aren’t really risk it’s everyone else causing problem. 

This set motion starting October. 

Newsom left lockdown enforcement counties/cities. Many cities decided enforce restrictions. People still flooding bars San Diego past weekend even though bars supposed closed. 

I’m disgusted people right now. Everyone bitching healthcare system falling short. it’s residents &amp; tourists dropped ball. Well Jacks complete lack surprise. bought vaccine proven effective It’s doesn’t really work like though. Nurses already know nurse, jump right there, especially crisis. know spike bag, start IV, wipe butt, empty foley. ask something someone points out. staff would immediate positive effect. say nurses that’s usually needed, really could healthcare position. General hospital care quite universal. far biggest difference age groups affected. COVID killing elderly sick whereas Spanish Flu killed young healthy. say every hospital. current hospital gave vaccine anyone wants it. preferential treatment. saw executive leaders mixed nurses staff lines hospital. staff volunteers encouraged, mandatory. That's 7500 employees total. Gov. Desantis ordered hospitals vaccinate much staff interested first weeks. dispersed community. One might think Nebraska meat processing plants might see benefit employee vaccination programs. Surely there's undocumented workers there. know it'snot going betterment hospital, going towards boss's new yacht! Thank goodness rich people can't get sick staff give Covid dirty peasants can't afford donate hospital. Good read, thank much. didn’t ‘solve’ anything lol.  always way. Titanic let first class board lifeboats allowed second class third class. looked also need employer lined lump sum invest start business Honestly point barely care Just. Get. Everyone. Vaccinated. fines imposed hospitals getting vaccine right people causing doses sit worst case, go bad. Yes elderly at-risk getting first, getting shots anyone's arm ultimately good. they've cheated way front line they'll go away rest get it. Treat ^But ^lay ^down ^while ^I ^drive ^over ^you fact countries socialized healthcare economic incentives COVID death rates comparable. often ask general terms ""how stupid be?"" like man aims answer rethorical questiom again. do?! Call immigration line get vaccine? Whoaw noble thing do. Yeah. Ours.  LOL! came back almost month later make profound comment.

Bitter much? difference ease controlling pandemic, will.

It absolutely easier ensure compliance smaller populations. don’t know people religious denying basic fact. ill workforce productive cost preventing deaths much lower replacement cost ""Human Capital"" IMO

That said, donating much I'm willing let get little preachy

Totally agree 5 years social sciences (econ,poli sci) going pumping PhD's thesis this. Somewhat related, I'm looking buy house soon honestly understand market stays afloat. Almost every house $500,000+ even though median household income like $80,000. fuck people making work? know do? idea might help. wear mask cover mouth nose. practical way force compliance contact tracing. couple cases there? Maybe. horse left barn back February. getting first actually slowing process sure. see study? see published? see figure 3? see authors wrote efficacy dose 1 dose 2? see actually never said anything mentioned? basically saying hey remove ppl data analysis.... look googling doesnt equal one's professional training ok? New hampshire reported thier uptake rate 75 80% health care provider group. also seemed imply mostly lower educated groups health care (CNAs, janitorial, food service) currently refusing believe change see everyone else getting it. think huge problem... Yet. west, americans stockpiled masks ensured lots people left without any. Price gouging went long time. able manufacture masks locally, situation prices improved little, Finland least. 

My understanding initially, citizens instructed use masks people hoard medical professionals need acutely... British, living Florida years. moved back home December took test leaving, nobody asked it. quite surprised. Okay, I'll say – honestly expect rich get vaccine much later early stage rollout can't say mind. know think acceptable, do. think people get vaccine, better, vital people get first, oh, well, least someone getting virus spread slowing down. know important protect vulnerable populations world perfect honestly prioritize speed anything else, vaccinate everyone quickly possible. understanding 40% others hospitals getting it. hospital still 60% batch available, probably ought get quickly possible easiest way call already affiliated hospital Oh forget hospitals banking big time. Ignore fact tons patients racking literal millions bills dying, leaving hospital state foot bill, there's elective surgeries help balance cost. personal favorite. anything said? masks far better common blue white k95 masks. immediately see side side put on. made USA electrostatic filtering CUPPED semi rigid masks.

They flop around, seal face, lab rated. made USA.

WHY HELL people stubborn told better masks. DEAR LORD wonder country bad, full know alls can't read!

This taken seriously blamed esoteric concepts like ""the system"". state made people controlled elected officials. Late reply, may interested see nsw weekly case reports get understanding transmission.

They’re in-depth, show superspreading (at large social events) far outweighing secondary transmission within home/office ... least context early identification cluster.

Here’s one  See page 14.  16 primary exposure sites (one private dinner party, rest public).  Ranges 28-1 infected event total 99 primary cases.  lead 4 secondary infections outside home 21 within home.

The cluster bit weird since 2 sites confirmed cases bowling club (lawn bowls) rsl (retired serviceman’s league).  would’ve skewed older/retired.

That means fewer chances workplace spread maybe explains high case load first place - older might bit likely catch (as well likely suffer severe effects.) mean, SARS (Caused Coronavirus) back 2003 lucky contain it. Nostradamus realize likely threat terms disease either Influenza Coronavirus. Eh is. didnt act good faith. brains know thing called reason someone would act way. 2+2 really Remove stability introduce fear, watch human beings respond irrationally reason medical system prepared experiencing now. 

COVID patients need medical staff trained respiratory care. isn’t generally need many people trained skills. Plus COVID patients remain ICU longer patients needing care do, reduces resources. 

There shouldn’t scenario reach point. wasn’t planned experts ran scenarios, “government actively working sabotage efforts contain disease”, “people acting selfish fuck endangering lives”, “law enforcement Jack shit enforce restrictions” accounted for. said long term safety testing would required escape mutation. I’m trying say proven platform formulation, already flu, would required. needs happen new sequence mutant strain gets inserted existing vaccine done matter weeks. Thats ridiculous oversimplification bill. money given condition jobs spared. definitely starting salary Chicago (CPS). wash hands opening mail parcel &amp; disposing wrapping. cases know contents leave thing shelf 72 hours. Oh ok Meat packing plants.  Nine cases total think, days... per day. never figure source “second wave”. strange. girlfriend teacher district remote teaching, making teachers come remote teaching school (indoor school, walls separating classrooms). They've multiple teachers test positive, yet still insist this...it's absolutely mind-blowing similar size island populations like Ireland shambles. Liquid oxygen second cheapest industrial liquid water.

Btw, attempts make space launchers cheaper using air breathing engines instead rockets misguided: LOX almost free. That's rational. Democracy ""shake off"" Anti-Democrat leader. Democracy strong people living trust system.

Democracy like money. works, believe support it. social contract, nothing more, nothing less. moment majority looses fate system, totally worthless. always drift autocratic system, nationalist, socialist, militarist, matter.

This fault American people, elected Trump. ""the system"". Um. already is? Look fast things picked around October. That's true, 1918 flu easily transmitted far deadly. also hit harder young people course hits economies much harder Covid (which kills mainly people already retired retire). read linked, oops777 one named him. Gates quote kinds sounds like moral argument. I’m sure it’s clear “can’t” means doesn’t make sense impossible. Republicans take “it’s unacceptable” dismiss self righteous moralizing. point economy relies people spending money. need money also willing spend it. need confidence things get worse also willing leave house spend. Simply opening businesses accomplish things. 

It interesting see economists come coming years. Comparing New Zealand rest world. Comparing aid provided different governments around world. Unfortunately America control group got little direct aid people. Yes!!! Every hospital created biased algorithm, many execs getting true front-line staff. places better hiding tracks. Work two separate hospitals they’re guilty, except one ended news not. draw ""p"" sound, like *Yippppppppppee*! Ccp scum world. Probably easier trade. surprised, mock science, believe witchcraft burn gays streets. course , U.S. Well. warned. us fucking idiots still gather. feel sorry anyone anymore dies anymore. folks still gathering despite warnings had, we'll, good, one less idiot. Sorry said Michigan.gov/coronavirus 

They great job showing trends time, current data yesterday regarding hospitalizations Hospitals tab cumulative data. started reporting pediatric admissions seperately August 2020, I've tracking daily since. last highest number recorded 35 peds cases late November. days good data coming holidays, I'm hoping someone entering couple numbers wrong field something. honest right now. many US’s problems virus think stem directly people driving across Canadian Mexican border? actually look forward jury duty. want kind person would want judging trial. 🤔

I hope they've hired good astrologer charge program. Nothing ever change!! Reeeee!!! ""Menus"" I'd imagine.



For ordering new penises. Wait guys never flavored peanut butter? sad. thinking like cynical american greedy business...

""And way, we're trying get ambulances back field""

If ambulance can't pick people up, revenue limited ROI decreases. already accepted fact can't treat even give air ( oxygen) have. raise prices compensate lower volumes cover fixed costs running business....which imagine would go well customers vaccine passports.

Immediately government different connotation lmao Agree- I’m bothered this. First, crap happens every day. could make argument wealthy nation, (the US) thing poorer countries don’t money buy huge batches vaccine wasn’t even invented yet. end day, get many people fast can, don’t sit around talking perfect order. Speed key. anyone know delivery schedule is?

The EU ordered 80 million initially added 80 million that. People age 65 get free medical care social security benefits... costs country literally $1.6 trillion dollars year...

Also value issue... fact one's surprised veterans home filled 95 year old people lung cancer make respiratory disease makes way through... Everyday they're alive they're lucky deadly disease comes along exactly priority ruin millions kids forever try keep racist guy alive another week mean, clearly morbidly obese... reasons need mask factories, testing tracing facilities stay. going away soon. don’t expect people play basketball all. There’s social distancing masks full court basketball. playing people willing get inches front strangers, expect cavalier actions. mean overall, tracking received doses seeing many still end contracting Covid. realize that, yes. also realize case numbers stay high despite vaccinating risk populations number cases drives restrictions. (uneducated) guess deaths hospitalizations decrease months case numbers stay relatively high mass vaccination year now. That’s think we’ll still social distancing 2022. doubt? mean really stupid think China allow first place. hide origins virus. There’s reason China’s contained virus. It’s great universal freedom normal times, continuing freedoms pandemic 3.5k deaths day right now. Criticize want know draconian punishments would end mess. get tested COVID antibodies? would tell past infection Probably want able work hospital? finish whole vaccination program hospital move on? that’s expo writer entertainment hosts job journalist supposed objective  Yeah, results supposed come late January early-mid February approval believe. Hide yo wife, hide yo kids. Thanks contribution.

Not sure mean, he’s publicly stated exactly said did. rest opinion

That's absolute failure planning management. 

As soon demand drops current phase, open next phase. specifically 64.1% Oxford/AZ vaccine closer 52% Pfizer vaccine. 2nd dose efficacy vaccines significantly diminished spreading 2nd dose.

I think trying make comparison here, want point numbers comparable. Astrazeneca number includes cases 21 days first dose administered, whereas Pfizer number includes cases time administration first dose, even day dose administered (see page 32 Astrazeneca able get data longer period because, [due lack supplies, able vaccinate everyone (Also, worth noting results massive confidence intervals.) * Working home still effectively regulated, ""recommended""

Do think virus magically inhabited like immaculate conception? Lol taking classes children's hospital.. universally called ""the crud"" unspecified illness around large groups dirty kids adults catch. major local hospital announced vaccinated staff, including administrators, early January.

Why 30-something administrators working home get shot vulnerable elders care homes? think since follow shit since january 2020 mod message top bit? cheap effective, maybe 2%. 

FTFY 50% 60+?! That's cool. hope see greatly reduced mortality rate current wave. Hold supermarket bought beer realize every single person needs vaccinated essentially end pandemic, right?

What think happen restrictions vaccination effectively ended mass hospitalizations overloaded hospitals? That's going happen first, at-risk population frontline workers vaccinated. 18,000 CVS Walgreens United States. one 28 vaccinations per day would extra half million doses per day.

I recognize challenges storage pharmacy isn’t going freezer goes -70 degrees, surely least every medium sized city one one setup used central storage provide daily deliveries pharmacies.

CVS Walgreens already online appointment systems setup testing easily repurposed vaccine. I'm Michigan administrator small rural clinic. 25 percent staff passed opportunity get vaccinated yesterday county health department. tried find avail. Fortunately allowed vaccinated work close proximity patients take personal responsibility dispose contaminated PPE staff suspected COVID patient seen. 

Late yesterday received notice local hospital looking find people vaccinate. really understand people sometimes. opinion article labelled such. 

It opinion article written sitting US Senator, also happens United States House Committee Foreign Affairs. exactly something written Joe Nobody. Chinese government official written something, would problem saying China wrote it? Nope. I'm saying deserve die but.... world would better/safer place without them. taken seriously design order 'protect economy'. good science early showing aerosol spread. US purposely ignored science imo. 

The misinformation weaponized directed citizens bunch wtf. glimmer hope: Normality summer? odds Long term effects include dying fucking COVID spreading love. It’s **ALWAYS** competition!

**‘MURICA! MURICA! MURICA!** died government’s inaction. No? dead host stops producing virus cells die (and host stops exhaling them).

They would cost little $1 per test. 

And thinking along lines testing 
co-workers restaurant open dining...the cooks, servers etc. 
Or testing employees working day inside closed warehouse. 

But dentist office (which find terrifying) could test every patient...a great way reduce airborne transmission would hang air patient could turn away infected patients. 

We really proactive this. Everyone testing start feel symptoms point already infected people. 

As mentioned, everyone acted everyone infected wouldn’t need frequent testing people careless irresponsible. right, probably won’t test themselves. certain places required , think would make difference. 

It still won’t prevent people hanging small cramped parties weekend get tested workplace Monday could removed test positive infecting anyone else. pace vaccination barely improving all.

But! funding actually came thru. states supposed carry massive vaccine effort funding support history vax effort scale all. 

It starts top top failed us again.

Details think lot people mental limit isolation  *Southern teachers -- sad noises* states properly compensate provide adequate benefits educators first.  “blue” context sky? ocean? general trend viruses become less lethal time, dipshits running argument mutations always make viruses less lethal since pandemic began.

the actual reality complex cant know 99 percent mutations would less virulent.

this paper uses term virulence refer general possible, assume simple working definition virulence: harm caused pathogen infection, particularly terms host morbidity mortality. commonly stated idea often evolutionary trade-off virulence transmissibility intra-host virus replication necessary facilitate inter-host transmission may also lead disease, impossible natural selection optimize traits simultaneously. case MYXV, trade-off thought lead ‘intermediate’ virulence grades selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean rabbit host dies inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence selected increase virus transmission rates. similar trade-off model proposed explain evolution HIV virulence40. However, many doubts raised general applicability trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness affected traits virulence transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results observed experimental studies45 relatively little known evolutionary trade-offs nature. example, case second virus released biocontrol European rabbits Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — evidence virulence increased time, probably virus transmission often occurs blow flies feed animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies plant RNA viruses shown high virulence necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, case malaria, higher virulence shown provide Plasmodium parasites competitive advantage within Pretty sure downvoted idiots like get reference.

I’d hardly say overtaking China would world butterflies meadows like really disgruntled ex. Trying manipulate way lives way possible. That's really interesting know possible destroy virus 'over-mutating' like that. However happen virus naturally, mutation rate enough slowly evolve without destroyed. interesting research path antivirals though! vaccinations slow right now? I’ve looking infuriation, can’t find anything. course, reality could get far, far worse.

With mind, like think best keep ahead take necessary measures based overestimate rather opposite. 1 million vaccine shots day, take well year vaccinate everyone. Remember, two shots required want vaccinate 250 million people, 2 million shots day would take 500 days.  last paragraph unnecessary don’t blame them.

1) lookouts binoculars officer key locker replaced last minute. Oops.

2) crew conducted lifeboat drills training voyage. biggest lifeboat drill conducted ship port, crew lowered boat, rowed around dock minutes brought back up.

3) Nobody crew knew many people boats able carry. Titanic's lifeboats could hold 65 people comfortably tested 70. emergency boats held 40, collapsible boats held 47. regular boats bottom reinforced steel split lowered full capacity. crew also know this.

4) Everyone knows Titanic enough lifeboats everyone board. reason conventional wisdom time ship going sink, would sink slowly distress signals could fired another ship(s) would able get time. lifeboats would used ferry passengers B. actually happened years another White Star ship. Lifeboats also mandated weight, passenger capacity, regulations really outdated.

5) historians say, based actual timeline boats launched, even ship enough lifeboats everyone, would launched time ship sank anyway. above, nobody really knew chaotic.

It worked everyone told. 

Now California tale two states. San Francisco/ Northern California still amazingly. Viruses think - choose evolutionary path, mutational one.

Viruses (and bacteria rest ilk) driven reproduce, spread order survive. Less lethality, lethality, either fine long virus time ability spread.

I understand people say things like cherry picking information. literally viruses earth stars universe. Humans able observe infinitesimally tiny number became less lethal, moreso, - Spanish flu maybe less lethal, example; smallpox likely MUCH lethal; Plague seemingly maintained lethality.

This particular virus already amazingly infectious, means transmissibility great. also DNA virus, less likely skew junk mutational strains proofread itself. strain extends a- pre-symptomatic stage (increasing transmissibility further) ends killing hosts often (once symptomatic onset occurs) would equally effective evolutionary path- virus increase contagious properties, thus continue propogate - would virulence decrease long transmissibility remains grows.

It's doom gloom say actually know happen here: could go either way. actually know viruses, propagate, evolve, mutate still - scientifically speaking - knowledge infancy.  media saying months one seems want change this.

Lol couple months ago would've infinity years cause vaccine exist yet... wrong. Assuming use 1 million average number shots given day. Instead administering 300 million shots, giving 600 million. people getting second dose mean still part 1 million day average. leaders focusing GA elections now. Finally someone speaking truth. Amen! Damn man... Thank much iam going read rn

So, enjoy gambling lives children, family others? cool 😎 Hey guys. rather important request me. wanted gather data number vaccines distributed administered states U.S. since December 13. website find data CDC. problem CDC show past data many vaccines distributed / administered. So, anyone data looking ranges December 13 now? Thank you. confirmed reinfections happen. rare. Last stat saw one 10,000 God damn *slams hat ground* Freedom comes cost. Masks small help. Masks combined maintaining least 6 feet distance others household, severely limited time home inside spaces restricted airflow. measures combination work surprisingly well. Yeah. He’s frustrated. Gets bad info time time (as everyone does). definitely gives shit means lot. I'll take ”things said judge send jail"" 400, please.  cases declining since mid December, actually. see graph is, healthcare capacity reached, even get fewer cases every day, still continue add hospitalizations system becomes overloaded. takes weeks people get discharged die.

California great bed-to-population ratio, 1.8 beds per 1000 residents, US national average 2.6. vulnerable surging states. keep current restrictions keep case numbers low, healthcare system recover weeks. guilty murder?.... now. jurors knew passed judgement. Burt Reynolds Covid 21 yayyy 16 mins press conference Monday: Yes, exactly! don’t think educators WANTED shut down. We’ve resources prioritize safety students ourselves. opened site, two masks provided district, spay bottle cleaner, gallon hand sanitizer would made students smell like they’d sprayed tequila. Nothing else provided. 

I requested face shield. One face shield. told didn’t funding it. ended buying own. 

Kids can’t share supplies. provided any? Nope. kids can’t afford own. always provide shared supplies.

One angle mention is, many people might affected COVID already. diagnosed weeks ago, lucky gotten fine. plenty studies suggest natural immunity holding strong 6 months later - way see it, rate things going distribution, probably qualify vaccine June, knowing sort immunity (temporary otherwise) means I'd gladly give spot individual it, qualify sooner whatever reason. immunity proves decline, I'll happily get vaccine future need be. No, 'triage'. Review NIMS protocols. Threshold.... anyone watch Scott Pilgrim vs World? I've living Vietnam 4 years, funny first people believe Vietnam's numbers claiming hiding testing enough. Well, year situation still chill, foreign news would think there's Covid anymore, I'm really grateful I'm home Italy, even worse US Dr Doomer back! Yes tons them. expect show en masse soon.   Fair points; that’s huge downside, therefore worth it. really hope grandma makes :( saying theory works fictional world?

Yes, sounds right. Definitely going click stupid fucking link Yep. Almost everything we've done made much sense expect anytime soon. You’d thought months preparation moment would enabled efficient rollout. Turns without American NHS we’re fucked. wrong day still rejects aerosol spread? feel like istitutions supposed look us bit broken know we're 5 days NYE we're 11 days Christmas. Would started seeing holiday surge yet? Keeping fingers crossed seems like cases steady. grandma's nursing home went 9 months without outbreak. scheduled get vaccine tomorrow. Today got diagnosed COVID, 30 others last week nursing home's first outbreak. going die, fault own, one patient-facing employee brought week vaccination. 

She's going die alone unfamiliar room due fault own, unnatural causes. Stay home. Wear fucking mask. Stay home. stay home. Imagine offered money take vaccine people would lining it. done healthcare workers now. encouraging. Exactly lol, get whole ""let's place 100% blame trump administration"" cause they've piss poor job, real navie think words tweets would suddenly fix america's stupidity. People denying covid dying hospital lol tweet going change minds come China mentioned? They're true masters COVID, non-island nation 1.2 billion center global economy. They're ones playing 4D chess. Agreed. Certainly good predictor great number things related pandemic. I'm wondering, however, there's something nature viruses cause behave way OP states. One could rationalise that, sure, I'm particularly interested reading empirical evidence behind this. great influenza John Barry. 

Most viruses want survive, kill host fast can’t spread many host. tend mutate less lethal form typically also mutate contagious version response buffers put place try curb spread, happening Uk variant. 1918 flu mutated version today far less lethal still pretty contagious. jury duty, said, let one refusal slide second issue ticket. Eventually bench warrant. 

They mentioned donuts eating paid refusers ticket fees. child psychiatric care told room waited two nights medical ward spot psychiatric ward. So, yes. know personal experience. [I look I'm person living world total fear, instead going extremes, I'm willing take reasonable precautions. government keeps second dose ships needed providers don’t save any. hospital gets doses today, they’ll get shipment number 21 28 days, depending vaccine manufacturer (probably little sooner since second doses administered +/- days recommended interval. heard +/- 4 days acceptable).  ever shall do, almighty ""ExoticMoose3613"" hast sullied mine good name. /s  Medical workers nursing home residents &amp; workers easy ones. hard part comes next. It’s fact CDC’s recommendations vaccine priority take racial “equity” account prioritizing young healthy “essential workers” (retail, restaurant workers etc) vulnerable older people. probably “virtue signaling” person referring to. I'm misrepresenting data. See MHRA working Annex Table 1: (warning PDF download link)

They estimate first dose gives somewhere around 90% efficacy point estimate. riot streets. you? Unfortunately mainly true viruses death host impacts chances transmission.
But Covid infectious onset symptoms days later. host later dies irrelevant spread virus. less lethal strain might probably advantageous. Short, sharp lockdowns win! world wanted frame China, started early 90s, little late stop Chinese Economic Bullet train arriving Summer 2024 Apparently longer day.  courtrooms enough space seat 12 people social distancing. jury box. hard judges made law school figure out.

I consider schools essential like healthcare grocery. Again, sticking facts, point statistics teachers schools dying disproportionate rate would quickly reconsider.

Thank Vaccine distribution going slower large part state governments careful making sure given correct order.

It's unfair rich people get vaccine earlier might otherwise, instances far preferable millions vaccines expiring hospital shelves. FFS Like clockwork need vaccine everyone herd immunity. concern long incubation/early shedding period symptoms present worsen, followed lethal/quicker mortality rate.

It gets parrotted far often lethal always means less spread, factors independent. virus technically mutate spread more/quicker lethality longer consistent incubation period spread occurs symptomatic. Thailand’s economy better expected. isn’t dependent tourism people think. economy thrives agriculture, manufacturing, seafood. Thailand able prevent second wave almost whole 2020, it’s bad economy-wise. Unfortunately, areas heavily affected, like Phuket islands depend tourism. It’s quite sad see huge divide. See job job end story Well. Hello, idiot! wonder anyone considered someone(?) framing China create collective hatred them? It’d really good way ignite war China try remove world power right checking out. shoppers telling protestors leave. checked got ASAP. Well since lawmakers don’t respect laws we? It’s times like I’m really glad I’m indoorsy. I’m definitely going little stir crazy, I’m “eh, it’s annoying whatever” actually making upset ya bud, reign fuck in.. shove wench. Seriously, people understood convoluted calculation behind ""0% ICU capacity"" would feel downright deceived. Gotta admit headlines catchy though.  Anything consumption! /s boasting China response Covid19? “Purely political” explained measures PA taking used word “blue”. really giant circle jerk isn’t it? Calling 'very bad wave' bit misnomer.

Incredibly envious right now.   forgotten new strain. kids class (sped) sometimes forget teachers see minimum 20ish kids per day, let alone rotate classes. explanation makes lot sense. Go talk healthcare worker ask feel whether think article alarmist. Every virus weakness. Testing pointless point. Vaccine distribution going slower large part state governments careful making sure given correct order. 

It's unfair rich people get vaccine earlier might otherwise, instances far preferable millions vaccines expiring hospital shelves. less people. Data says longer 2 days 'after effects'. Hope feel better soon! Exactly. you’re taking mother’s word every mother going say kid perfectly healthy happy. comes pertinent facts want get secondary less biased source facts. you’re right, “journalists” actually think things. Another false hope brewing. Another week narrative “Fauci disappointed slow vaccination process” Ya Taiwan general communal, rule following aspect society. make judgment visiting Taipei seeing bikes left without locked locked cable locks (that would stolen two seconds neck woods) people respecting eating/drinking rule metro. would also fly here.

 love teachers much. glad got chance experience day.  one way fix VA. Let patients die. Hardly. goal kill lot people aren’t really good job could have. create fair bit mayhem suppose. Maybe it’s ruse distract actually doing. fuck knows. even bother speculating  trial docs specifically lay 30 day period sexual activity required condom use. leads think someone thought damage sex cells definitely possible

I literally mention mis-information respond mis-information. 

Yes trials provision every pretty much vaccine trial(Johnson &amp; Johnson/Novavax/Oxford importantly+ others) use mRNA tech. going tell since vaccines provisions unprotected sex chance cause damage sex cells? vaccines use tech around many many decades wide use? gung ho “VACCINATE WORLD” position

I agree however think people stop thinking BIO-1000 university classes makes smart enough accurately judge safe vaccine is(which doing) spout wrong stuff internet(which done already multiple times).

If one person needs CPR, three losing dangerous amount blood, sprained ankles, might prioritize people bleeding first, since might take less effort stabilize someone dying blood loss, leaving person needs CPR die. (Or accurately, remain dead since would already dead administering CPR) prioritizing people aren’t quite much danger, help people live it. prioritize people Red, earlier example.

Reverse triage quite thing, prioritizes care people quickest released early, yellows example scale. prioritizing yellows either get hospital beds, battlefield get holding gun.

Dude mans man, served two tours Vietnam, injured times (spent weeks end hospital), awarded two Purple Hearts..... it’s like country supposedly supports troops doesn’t really care vets. Fuck sucks wasn’t sarcastic, pretty much agreeing you. must forgotten ordeal Covid brain damage get hot tub?! starts showing fucked now.
Over 81000 new cases specimens taken 29th December. W.T.F.! Same. quite surprised low price haha. know confident enough claim things mRNA tech that's easily disputed 40 seconds researching? 

I'm sorry seem aggressive probably biological functions could touch educated ones worry knowledge have.

Likely concerns have, independent panels/scientists world probably asked/answered questions already way way depth you/I could ever come close without getting PHD virology come family hard time experimental drugs

I'm sorry family spreading misinformation internet hurts people. said information emotions rather facts. Vaccination shoukd mandatory Huh, whereabouts Tucson you? I'm Casas Adobes, since I've seen someone *wasn't* wearing mask correctly.

Also, dick noses, totally stealing that. Stay safe! can't bring forward date open 1B? Like \~80% 1A either vaccinated declined, move next priority. saw commercial today new AMC Walking Dead spinoff called ""The Walking Dead: Dead Mink Walking"". People working home privileged highly educated people earning lot money. Especially you, lives beach expensive CA property prices taxes. Fuck delusional. mean, fair, like EU faring much better moment. Italy went one helluva lockdown they're still struggling Lol - everything store (up to) 50% off. 

Actually, it’s pack gum. also without J&amp;J's vaccine. Assuming gets approved assuming effective as, say, Sputnik (similar adenovirus vector), we're going mass vaccinations CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid without deep freeze logistics issues. Yes, delusional. Lmfao.  Selfish... say that? medical facilities ship relatively new. engine room old. Well gives little bit hope! Maybe shows come back they're slated come back (June 2021). Enjoy send sweet Las Vegas sun Pennsylvania! Im sure sweden.  

But switzerland counts every death person active Covid (pcr confirmed) statistic.  

If similar sweden could alsp play role veteran wanted veterinarian. great absolutely included!!! Want beer? 😃 Keep bro every single article see nowadays completely unnecessary. think tier system necessary prevent mad rush chaos. issue planning disburse priority tiers, expect many people turn down. Let's say there's 10 million people jobs qualify receive vaccine, 90 million people priority. polarized society is, 10 million reject vaccine. frees 4 million doses, maybe 36 million people general population want 4 million doses ASAP. want 6 million health workers want vaccine queue fastest-fingers-first get ahead 56 million gen pop want it. 

I think needed over-schedule priority people get understanding perfect system might come back tomorrow. lot manpower needed manage system, man phones name lists etc. I’m sorry; I’m bit pessimistic also realist. US, response pandemic absolute unmitigated disaster. hard, say though, unable ""visit"" really really pleasant. seen parents person since mom released hospital - got went lock next day. went vacation Arkansas, Texas Louisiana maskless finally gave up. vacation uncle (moms brother) passed.

Why looking blueberry bush matters? really liked HBO series Brink, provided different perspective. never long life known anyone fed ER. would never even thought ask food.

They vending machines. area pandemic fatigue months. Even strict people know reaching breaking points Scorpions Las Vegas! :D Ah, see guys use vast groups people one shared experience right-wing propoganda machine. can’t seroconvert virus, aren’t seroconverting vaccine either.

Antibodies either require cells B cells recognize coronavirus antigens. Yes, are. allowing sons buy groceries original lockdown, soon started “senior hour” grocery store, insisted everything again. virtual appointments weeks, decided safe go person again. 

I’ve begging stop going church, least, since one dangerous places go, won’t. virtual mass first, think safety precautions church taking good enough.

We got sick March despite mask wearing, careful hand washing, going grocery store, know get too. basically everywhere northern hemisphere 'the increase' September though? japan never locked Shit terrible man, never though would see many people check early like that.

as misleading (it was) experts response based gross misunderstanding purpose ""mix match"" guidelines (it contingency planning document promotion lucky dip moving forward) , articles author interviewed expert admitted clue UK running heterologous prime boost (aka mix match) vaccine trial. UK country world thus far bother important research. 

Therefore suggestion UK 'abandoned science' 'trying guess way mess' absolutely absurd, based ignorance. dangerous thing say, like Faucis suggestion UK rushed pfizer approval later walk back . 

Hetrologous prime boost valid scientific approach bolstering vaccine immunogecity, idea strong merit. chadox vector used past good results.  expected combination AZ pfizer could generate stronger, durable immunity two individual doses pfizer two AZ. (In part pfizer give stronger ab weaker cell response vice versa) hence clinical trials run 

I explained many times person responding to, well correcting misinformation dose schedule regimens persist promoting idea (including doctoring statements quotes ) UK acting like reckless banana republic. Appreciate trying think effort one wasted. heard today unused vaccines thrown subject fine give vaccine anyone younger 70! even vaccinated every qualified person hospital left over! shocking government would rather let someone get it. (although agave doubt ultra rich receive cuz privilege) 50 worked since March facialist massage therapist. hands on, rather dealing people refusing wear masks facing even contagious mutation many therapists practices taking clients. TOP 2019 planned trip Ireland visit family new niece. tickets arrangements made paid full early 2020. get go. However, felt reassured vaccine would provided population via well thought plan, like countries Europe it. trust vaccinated August, required avoid 2week quarantine (pretty much whole trip). afraid gifted flights accommodations lost. Guess wishful thinking, considering government has(n't) handled crisis start.  *reaches bottle xanax. again.* Went boating trip Willamette river summer shocked see Mercy sitting right front me. Oh God. Nobody wants ICU old ass ship. dreadful. Won’t happen. Rules thee 101. Nope wife nurse REQUIRED vaccinations employer good sick vulnerable patients.  people turn down? Yeah I'm looking forward jury duty later month. Nah, ""covid standby lot"" 30 people wait (parked cars) text vaccine opens up, plus text alert system room opens lot. Nothing better do? go wait lot, might get vaccine?

don't dim. “No concerts another year!” Well, guess we’ll see I’m probably going one May year. People credit Taiwan government keeping COVID check, way yes, feel people willing follow trust government guideline play large part. 

With local outbreak, see everyone...and mean EVERYONE wear mask venture out. Even 5 years old kid wear mask throughout day kindergarden complains. 

Wearing mask outside never stigmatize even COVID. Culture play large part these. Jeez, many people arrested serve juror result fines jail time.

The court dismissed anyone said comfortable court pandemic.

Those dismissed made innocent mistake trusting court put risk processing court responsibility declare mistrial, inform jurors exposure, release them.

The court responsibility protect innocent. legitimate reason hold trials way did. bullish\*t, expected. Again... *trust nobody.* ban traveling fair ever see republicans blindly loving army Sad. wish higher penalty trying target seniors scams. Kind like hate crime places US pretty normal already (South Dakota, Florida, rural parts many states). rest country get combination pandemic fatigue declining cases / deaths make people unwilling support restrictions more. cant lose you. Take break something really bad happens lost happens. permission world. idiots keep turning down!! guess everyone forgot stop talking Confused miss what’s big difference here? What, don’t like freedumb spread deadly diseases, ignore reality heartless without consequences?

Obviously brainwashed Soros!

/s obviously. guess I’ll asking medical providers whether mandated employees get vaccinated.
 
Especially nurses F’s sake. Something word *fresh* unsettling Trudeau ""frustrated""...his dad would using expletives. part ?
Do really think, country everything monetized (even health) government throwing money military complex bring peace world give money back old friends Lockeed Martin? contrary probably best economic tool USA today. think airlines buying Boeing best plane? alone. Except overweight caused lot things eating pizza People trying really hard know it. Let’s pretend freezers broken talking about? received 2400 dollars today, roughly half mortgage. struggling conditions like that? /s So? And? Nothing done deaths either. really fucking sad. I've gotta say, Covid longest lasting thing that's made China... \* gallows humor \* Well fucking terrifying read 24 hours diagnosis. feel like type people go cruises really interested seeing tourist trap side anyway. LA county - 10th largest state say many doses Canada used yet? Show percentage less USAs? storing half 2nd innoculation. first link one disproves point, Sweden experience excess deaths.

I understand like top mandates else stop pandemic? would love see people choosing follow recommendations lot people actively choose opposite. them? thing is, production finally bouncing back since finally moved holidays. Clicks baby! Get people riled upset click! wonder mental state poor nation. We’re fucked constantly media sell ads. ""Kids lowest risk"" think teachers concerned dying kids dying. Mask social distancing key, best social distance home away everyone I’m sure old normal ever coming back. new normal. Obviously, hoping absolute best outcome. year really tough. think republican problem though. Blindly loving army American problem. purpose vaccine making sure person gets vaccine get disease. all. vaccine created for. Take vaccine, don’t get coronavirus. Take vaccine, don’t get measles. Etc. lockdown chance working ""Here's check we'll food delivered stay damn house we'll shoot you"" lockdown. Denmark agreeing probably become dominant.

If accelerate vaccinations quickly enough 1M per day, keep control till April even vaccinations ramp . Aaaaand virus outpace vaccine imo. that's comes starts evading antibodies. Shit.

 Well, that's call making best bad situation. Good them. indefinitely many, end kills them. limit single research limits scope provided research credible sources went analysis? Pfizer mention stats immunity around 90% past 14 days first dose, INSPQ got 92.7% analysing Pfizer's numbers build vaccination plan. 

Your source admits ""The cumulative incidence Covid-19 cases time among placebo vaccine recipients begins diverge 12 days first dose, 7 days estimated median viral incubation period 5 days,10 indicating early onset partially protective effect immunization."" use 52.7% number includes people vaccinated less 12 days prior. analysis can't used idea resulting immunity single dose, say ""The study designed assess efficacy single-dose regimen."", wrong use analysis make conclusion efficacy single dose regimen goal analysis, INSPQ's goal though. Seatbelt laws aren’t person wearing it’s sake. It’s get accident, it’s less likely it’s serious enough occupy resources like ambulance finite supply can’t scaled moments notice. 

Just wanted clear It’s absolutely combined coordinated (as much possible) response. Access money coordinated support systems well: interest mortgage repayments/freezes, eviction moratoriums, pid sick leave specifically covid, easy access quick testing facilities getting results back promptly, widespread testing, contact tracing, communication/marketing (government sponsored ads instructions wash hands example), restricting interstate movements, increased mental health support, living wage applied unemployed, employment support impacted businesses directly paid salaries, etc, etc, etc. 

There isn’t one silver bullet. It’s wear mask, lock coordinated focused efforts everywhere possible. Agreed, last administration really fucked us taking virus seriously. It’s point literally don’t think it’s possible contain virus except herd immunity vaccine. Doesn’t matter controls government now. First level ""Kontakt"" (Contact) Previous years? things like ongoing Israeli treatment Palestinians. Well put. helps, APA revised guidelines screen time. still want kids 18 months watching tv (though might choice), softened guidelines 6. 

From education perspective, want screens replace human interaction. could talking, reading, singing them, could playing kids - APA wants developing coordination language skills. 

However, mom dad working, options kinds interactions limited. 

Promote reading toys, that's possible. not, choose meaningful screen time (sesame street, khan academy, etc.) maximize non-screen interactions work. Yeah there’s still Trump signs flags neighborhood. parents live neighborhood sister’s family lives kids remote learning parent’s house. parents decided won’t see kids parents vaccinated, thankfully they’re waitlist vaccine. I’m Houston figure it’ll awhile get vaccinated. “WHO reported missing months”.  solves problem how? turning original 2 week lockdown 16 months?

Places closed people fucked beyond belief. Even appropriate messaging social contract US go work get help.

When asking people sacrifice food table money pocket staying home simply going to, even wanted to. Palestine never officially existed. cute try Palestine never officially existed. cute try Pretty sure mortality rate went US injecting millions people substance may even achieve result created for?

Incredible... people shrug thier shoulders assume well. Pointless 80% planet provide immunity. Let's simply ignore though. Ok, sorry man run troll phrases. Gotta give though. pandemic over, consider stand-up comedy something. believe median time infection mortality like 3-4 weeks. think mostly culture + messaging made difference, emphasis culture. Another huge, huge factor initial inoculum infected individuals world caught happening.

For context, Australia took ~6 months rid COVID Melbourne ~3 months elsewhere. had, max, 7000 active cases (not per day, that's cases one time). New Zealand far less that. US millions mid-March. think reasonable say US could avoided *unless* Trump taken seriously January/February.

However, hard ignore basically Asia well this, even countries government absolutely nothing (e.g. Japan). linked mask compliance, general hygiene, respect, etc...

There lot things work really well countries work well US. We're going need shift culture successfully implement it. offense, well seem searching prerational reasons reject idea, engaging ad hominem.  role martialing facts hand compelling narrative demonstrates circumstantial evidence indeed points lab release plausible scenario merits investigation. facts known since March extensively checked magazine top this.  physician many colleagues md/phd virologists think scenario likely.  going say thing Washington post?   respected virologists overseeing labs studying covid?   renowned infectious disease experts?   Wow scary. Worst part seeing government clearly lying it. important hold government accountable every single time caught lying, otherwise becomes common accepted. let lie get away it, becomes normal stuff like happens. feel awful nurses families dead. Heard arrested person recorded showed truth too. shameful lot quicker take hour walk hall almost anyone else.

Quicker? Sure. that's really metric. going much less burdensome retired person go take two (or 6) hours mostly free day go get vaccinated healthcare worker tired 12 hour day wants go sleep next 12 hour day.

Not quite sure ""familiar site provides healthcare"" means, every adult country going familiar pharmacy (likely drive-through one) and/or primary care clinic. article example deaths probably caused pandemic, virus itself. seem lot different sources deaths (suicides, starvation developing countries, missed screenings various diseases, etc.). said done interesting, sort morbid way, see whether virus second-order effects deadly. AFAIK people ignoring CA lockdown rules. remember thread! Small ~~world~~ Reddit. Interesting mostly mentions lack tourism killing economies tourist dependent small pacific island countries.  think interesting point made simple measure stopping incoming travelers social distancing allowed countries remain COVID free. reasons NZ Australia also well. ""criticism"" came year late. Advocating taking property disagree selling slavery?

Reddit moment Tiananmen Square massacre.  wonder much still catch holiday reporting lags? almost certainly China, first major outbreak China, basic logic epidemiology would say odds originated Italy exported China leading first epidemic incredibly low. someone wants look good get re-elected. Hastily reopen everything. Shit likes happens time right now, another thread in, people defending sports played still. sigh. Oo sounds lovely sounds like reality. Sorry snow either. supposed get weekend though. 
I remembered Netherlands conversation someone said America greatest country world country freedom speech... posted global rankings #6 true, need make country divide 4.8 million population islands really beat next pandemic. way. state Texas gonna become least 6 different countries. much could rent cost? $300? enough go market get bag full groceries $40 fill cars gas tank another $10. 

Oh look honey, American Bandstand TV. You’ll likely fine, obviously make sure completely self isolate! hope girlfriend get well soon ❤️ remember reports investigation mobile freezer units contaminated. One infected worked unloading them, suspected virus could frozen container, ice crystals melt, virus hangs water vapor.

Don't know became though. oh worry, plenty suckers. Depending pay, might tempting lol could agree sir. Unfortunately restrictions based live. 


Tl:dr whatever need happy. Sont let anyone stand way happy. take happiness expense innocent bystanders. person slighted ones taking away freedoms world. try take away freedoms happiness expendable. physical harm way ya feel? Everybody love everybody fucking wall.


We need take care rules. rules violate beliefs values find way change rules get caught breaking rules. 


If money takes whatever learn make money pay corrupt people behind scenes pulling strings. try help others. 


If powerful want capitalism exploit fuck agree change feel government represent you. cannot find fund suitable leader learn get there. charge yourself. money time takes. knowledge need money time. 


So use experts genius people around gain personal growth. make change immediate surroundings values/beliefs met can't without hurting anyone. whatever takes happy life expense true harm others. 


Don't cut hand get tv. life death cut hand. Understand sit idly I'm going tell happy. fucking happy. sad donþ really give shit. I'd prefer everyone happy though.


It literally driving force behind every extremist group. draw line success due expense others. Utilitarianism technically efficient practice. Thats opinion. would love know opinion truly. Flavian fake news.

Nero played Lyre. fiddle invented tenth century.

He also Rome fire, organized relief effort returned city.

Big takeaway: Nero better leader Trump. wish someone would make list hospitals this. Kinda goes Hippocratic oath no? “Oh, mean inverted curve” -Murica California Michigan. Shit closed. Restraunts doomed. Jobs like mine coming back nation vaccinated. joking, right? neither part government part EMA. think SA dropout deletions, checked yet...

I wish Canada could put distance us America Fox News idiocy. Trump Fox News responsible problems here. like found way digitize brain worms broadcast across border. I'll believe see it. types articles put forth theoretical possibility little say anyone real authority. guy owns ""Vacation Superstore Network, Best Price Cruises, Vogue Vacations"" existence app hoping capitalize possibility.

It's certainly going required international travel, beyond think reality domestically US. Especially fragmented health care system tech literacy older generations, businesses turn away unvaccinated people anyone jump hoops connect electronic medical record smart phone app, anyone trust data it.

Movie theaters live events industry endured year half practically revenue. think they're going take project. Concerts even resuming would necessitate high level herd immunity benefit pass public health even seem clear. We're going trap unvaccinated people quarantine. miss something ?

Yes, did. lot things. hardest part would track+trace system ended disaster. Closing borders completely could difficult I'm sure there's plan action somewhere. I'm sure there's hotels every airport could used house people 14 days. getting cases 0, almost still open borders, shit track+trace, forced quarantine.

Honestly much people say freedoms taken away, think government's fear people upset can't stuff cause half arsed policies. Can't make compulsory wear mask people scream human rights government can/will advise they're necessary. Can't force someone quarantine who's come back Wuhan they'll scream human rights government can/will advise necessary trust home.

The one time Tories could lived reputation cutthroat arseholes fucked up, surprise Definitely could be. also chance everyone's routine vaccination schedules thrown off. origonal shutdown, lot kids missed shots would normally gotten, regular pediatricians simply county health departments (at least locally) closed clinics too. pretty bad spikes whooping cough course flu, even years everything running normally, year, still isn't. We're 5th place Western world deaths/million, passed Spain----Belgium 1707, Italy 1263, Czech Republic 1160, UK 1121, US 1102, Spain 1100 cool cool cool 70 spread increased chance limited mobility. 

Health care professionals likely already health care setting least familiar site provides healthcare. busy, lot quicker take hour walk hall almost anyone else. Airports could see already staff sort job.  Movie theaters possible way took quite increase UK, breached percentage - almost exponential increase.

Remember first detected September, became readable percentage late November. they've gone ""two weeks flatten curve"" ""lockdown indefinitely"", even vaccine distributed (chief medical officer Chris Whitty said still restrictions next winter hope people remember next time government proposes ""two week"" ""four week"" lockdown ""flatten curve"" ""break circuit"" ""save Christmas"" whatever. hate say it, come think it, pretty much exact thing happened Arizona. Around 2017, fired *ton* teachers lowered bar one, increased class sizes, long term subs fill gap, recall correctly. 

You totally fire 40% teachers community fine churning bunch uneducated idiots. lockdowns aggressive, political leaders California ignored them, quite obviously. people telling everyone something ignoring it, shouldn’t John Q. Public? absolutely zero places america ""full lockdown"".

In spring, place even close NYC. nowhere else US even come close. know this...after every god-damned thing else... broke me. heart absolutely aches people, families, medical staff powerless watch happen. Ok hospitals weighting it, report 10% availability state reinterprets 0%. get remotely justifiable logic it, upfront arrive number. Close nothing April  ensure new laws account future leaders acting bad faith, e.g. populists claiming refugees immigrants epidemic protect against. fact say think meant criticism current administration going fix, think will. R/unexpectedspaceballs Awesome! get tank take hospital? get tank? would guaranteed called racist/new Jim Crow would National Guard they're trained medical stuff Vietnam tests per confirmed case country, far.

Singapore densely populated massive transport hub right geographical firing line.

Taiwan foresight pounce thing NYE 2019.

China nation billions squashed thing.

Why couldn't/didn't Ireland functionally isolate? 

The simple answer stopping covid-19 cultural will.

That's it.

For every excuse people put Europe USA.... point country similar demographics/geographics successful. US coronavirus research closely tied Wuhan, scientists could offer much insight whether grafting spike proteins onto bat coronaviruses feasible likely. Unfortunately seems sort code academic silence, holding back discussion fear backlash towards similar experimentation. sure there's connection people refusing take vaccine overall vaccination rates. may well keep jobs even vaccinate people even take themselves.

For vaccination really effective they're going recruit 10,000's people help administer shots. Hopefully tap national guard, retired doctors, nurses, vets, etc. bad apples refusing participate big deal. many actual PCR tests? Gosh, almost like FB cares money 'looking good' actually anything effective stem tide lies misinformation something! /s jealous guys. Cheers Canada. rest country. doesn’t explain California getting hit harder. see. many administer per day? non-physician health professionals (NPHPs) authorized  provide preventive services seem overwhelmed CA now. (see [table Unlike flu shot comes ready-to-go vials, Pfizer vaccine must diluted sodium chloride solution turned upside back 10 times injected. UK, two people need check dose beforehand doctors allocating around 8 minutes per shot, including wait times. flu vaccine takes minute administer. Doctors must monitor patient 15 minutes injection. Hopefully, shake vial administering *With vaccine room temperature, gently invert vial 10 times. shake vial.* *If vial shaken, discard vaccine.* *The vaccine white off-white color may contain opaque particles. use liquid discolored.* country army Didn’t scroll far see stupid comment, again. Two propaganda machines going it. China boycotting “billions AU imports” attempt sway au article. Vs thousands random pro China propaganda almost social media platforms ever since whole Hong Kong thing even so, since Corona. Since China closed internet, voices heard “open let investigate!” vaccine widely available, sounds like great idea !!!

However comes young adults able get vaccine spitting face group sacrificed older generation. point would expect problems younger generation ignoring restrictions entirely. lol; reminded freedome' fries 2003 Mhmm Mirror: Mine has. Multiple times. Sounds like another Novovax (which expected complete Phase 3 trials end month). bad news - that’s probably line want cross. 

You may find disagree covid, right wrong, “society”, least America, would rather things done covid denier. 

You can’t play “muh society demands” minority position. Cori Lightfoot best evidence whole ""more minorities power automatically good thing"" argument untrue. sucks bad. oppressed hell BLM protesters, literally turned city balkanized series moats respect free speech rights, this. blows.  hope so. live NY things still super shitty here. don’t know people downvoting me, things still far back normal. hear saying. 

And Covid slapping us mouth. us. 

Humans lackadaisical maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, traveling, gathering large groups, following universal precautions.

We working losing badly. someone living LA, certaintly feel like we've strictist lockdown. locked bay area, always seemed rigid rules longer restrictions. summer reopened gyms, indoor dining, lots indoor things. may closures places, say they're strictest. agree lockdowns may effective, especially without enforcement. country like US, see lockdowns like China. that, half-assed lockdown much. Please, ICU worker, explain might it. may news check out. Fuck place. Someone needs put Youtube video ""how give vaccine"" distribute them. yourself. could entire country vaccinated two days. there’s Malaysia, intents purposes, lockdown despite government saying consistently around 2000 new cases day. fuck. means, start vaccinating quickly. I'm sure vaccine delivery schedule is, possible doses held people get second shot.

But considering takes 2 weeks start building immunity 2 weeks second dose reach full efficacy, gonna week hospitalizations start dropping.

Experts agree- vaccine going stop pandemic full swing. Better social distancing compliance get pandemic control. analysis instantly fails factor fact 1) covid binary die/live decision, many infected longterm consequences, 2) consider raising pool infected geographical region exponential cascade effect infection rates region generally.
 
No use throwing academic dick around typing small novella going fuck basic assumptions bring disaster movie happy ending, im ready. champagne folding chair doorway  believe situation serious healthcare system LA broken nail coffin. good documentary believe called code black gets LA hospital system can't convince nurses take vaccine. heart never broken washing hands considered important surfaces minimal risk?   
I’m thinking minimal risk isn’t zero risk took seriously throughout last year - trouble is, get little cocky *I'm filtered, whatever want* attitude. truth is, know virus sails right filter concentrates hood. I'm betting life doesnt. (I P100 respirator mask use short trips well)

It's HEPA filter, least advertised one. One time sneezed produce section Walmart. Everyone turned look. ""Thank-God guy hood on"" air exits winter jacket... moment, strongly feel Gottlieb shut traphole instead adding confusion. Highly unlikely. strong union. could find people willing take one time. lot Americans working China, guess come work wont point view mentioning, people never come work (Well, maybe theres enough money... knows). 

Saying this, Chinese people value group Americans come work education, give class, teach them, teach sons, also business, English teaching super important value lot. lot Chinese citizens, American people working people dont speak trash. dont read FB Twitter see bad lot people talk, reality daily life Americans, foreigners, know. media shows Trump media outlets talking bad things. Oof Covid even still thing. People give shit random strangers. never let ""a mask nothing protect you"" cat bag. 50% effective bordering 100% effective comes severe COVID, really would rather 3000 people die like...10 people die. Hi, better luck checking r/COVID19positive people similar symptoms. I'd recommend talking doctor.  We're even using Moderna Pfizer doses already have. vaccine doses useless since they're going sit shelves anyway.

By time glorious leaders figure put vaccines arms, surprised AZ J&amp;J ready roll out. one mask dies, one gets mask definitely pussyfooting around. Give elderly sick start spamming drive throughs. doesn’t need perfectly done order needs fast. 50% vaccination better carefully picked 20% (obviously old sick first, that... fuck tiers) Fight fire fire.  mean like kind proof may uncovered investigation? Because....what research?? test kids symptomatic idea spreading asymptomatically. Given know kids spread germs like...well. kids...the chance spreading covid nil. Canada? (im too) friend complain wealthy hospital donor got vaccine week friend donates shit ton guy pretty tempted call hospital like “wtf?”

Blame lack federal guidelines distribution hadn’t fucking 11 months put together literally anything, everyone’s make go certainly wealthy people cut front line. leaders anything. good population people anything. disgrace Great contribution. Classic thoughtless. Life well spent describe normal construct effectively communist arrangements leadership take responsibility fear fired, transferred, etc.

Sorry understand said except this. mean USA operating like communist country? Quite confused.  Thats accurate. went strike last year got it. 34k barely minimum wage city, dont make people diagnosed covid need get vaccine right away...they chance re-infection astronomically low already got covered. practice TX county jury trials zoom. It’s ideal, sure beats getting sick. true, average salary 58k Chicago first year teacher You’re dumb. Significantly anti vax lesser educated people. Stop dumb. Yeah get jury duty I’m going. I’ve also stopped commuting crimes meantime sure, champ, that's occurred.

I note actually provided source instead continue talk ass. Abducting refugee children parents border putting cages pretty hateful. Trump, Balsonaro, Johnson, done garbage job pandemic. seems like agenda agree, vaccines age dependent opinion. people vaccinated 65 dumb. basis dismiss accept jurors, random selection fine. help argument:) 

Let's assume best paid consultants best demographic data available ... cases seeing jurors 1 time would decrease success rate nominal percentage points. resources, process helping you. worry done?

Also, aside: demographic information available literally every street USA. it? I’ve invasive operation. It’s 3 weeks now. really want get back sports... I’m told won’t able 3-4 months. barely leave house anyway severe operation was.

But already wish starting get back things. can’t work either moment. would emphasize primary physician willing take vaccine soon available he/she position give you. assume large part people's primary physicians know big risk factor. may inclined give known history.  know one primary said calling health department inquiring they'll get vaccines staff patients, calling consistently. I'm sure lot going right now. yeah many people already covid..so that's less vaccines needed cause re-infection rate improbable. old people get vaccine, pretty much go back normal since death rate majority 65+. network can't handle traffic and/or set right. tried help parents crashed nearly immediately set open, kept giving ""event scheduled"" messages hour tried refresh. friends went thing frustrated. pretty sure unless something changed, technically become veteran (as in, eligible veteran benefits) law deployed active duty 180 days, though exceptions feel like searching late night for. Months ago people claimed CA never got hit hard time New York bc already gotten late 2019 immune. kinda source tho TX teacher here. teach middle school, it’s worth. We’ve actually dozens teachers get it. It’s pretty scary actually. district non-renew fight take license quit right now. 

Anyhow, half 7th grade teachers got back October-like, two confirmed Tuesday, two librarian following Thursday-one shared student. wouldn’t call outbreak shut us bc student never confirmed it; student never tested. 

I’m best get it, kids hate bc I’m always telling fix masks, etc. spray desks seats class...no admin support, district absolutely set us fail. It’s insane. kids remote...it’s damn terrible. respond comment. 

that someone else, pointed errors understanding, meanwhile parrot shit simply true. virulence get selected for.

Laters. also said 200 million March weeks ago. That’s way 1 million per day. He’s throwing random numbers point. asshair stopped too, believe Fortunately minors highly immune effects Covid kid would quite safe. 

The risk kid contracting virus passing onto killing process. crackhead stole crack maybe you’d follow see crack thieves go? Idk thought Holy crap. point go outside start grabbing random people. even talk do, neither us really enjoy anything anymore.

Early on, making point keep touch people, talk friends/family, nothing say other. many times conversation? ""Yeah, nothing changed since last time talked. Weather nice walked around block today. You? Oh, also nothing, huh?""

I also find conversations start phrase lot: ""I know boring, I'm going tell anyway nothing else going life moment"" Ukiah small city, around 10 blocks 4 blocks, max, lower class housing bit middle class housing around 3 sides. cute. depressed, still, active logging town, majority redwood logging closed; single-skilled workers grown old, many work. downtown alive has/had wonderful, fun shops,  lived highway hour place far rural. hospital gem long stretch rural tourist serving residents. 15 min Mendocino, best little town California. need force take it. else going know safe. would run buy oil car mechanic refused use. decided months ago. guess new strain even announced then.    Thatd also feed conspiracies. 

""Why staff reluctant hospital pay order convince take it?""

An ultimatum needs healthcare workers refuse take it. termination least get suspended agree take it. Theyre refusal slows everything irresponsible willingly putting patients risk infection. create vaccine year either HSA really? Vaccine fix it? makes big difference us teachers. That’s decision though. family decide. don’t need someone else making decision family. 

Plus schools shown big spreaders mitigation. article England kids 12 don’t wear masks. That's thought too. donated 500,000$ hospital pay staff get equipment help everyone, think ok give vaccine. say many people actually taking skipping ahead? Hey CA: I'm ready vaccine. lemmeno get it. Thanks! consequence political demand smaller government. last mile developed. feds delivered freezer, that's it. describe normal construct effectively communist arrangements leadership take responsibility fear fired, transferred, etc. feds, starting 1/21 set last mile scenario distribution stream confident actions, purpose. avoidable tragedy.

The top dog vax'd btw... anti-vaxer. Cute, eh?  Yeah 5+ Russian govs putting bounties soldiers well. comment reminds this:

""The dangerous worldview worldview viewed world.""

Alexander von Humboldt It’s also spread airborne, “dry” say it. mostly small droplet. subscription model inbound. dry runs across country right now. Actual vaccination probably start 13th.

Also article fails mention infection last month pretty low less 3% positivity rate. OK. seems Germany going show excess mortality year whole though - certainly since start pandemic. mean wouldn’t count “I visit family can’t eat together sleep tent yard”, “I see friends sleep car” workable alternative normal actually wonder make happen. accept Russian Chinese passports? Colombian one bought street 20 bucks? see seen post well, like what, 49.7% USA? 7.5% UK so.

I'm suprised get banned right wing political subs, i'm minority. /s \^but really articles literally say aren’t getting shots PLO cut ties Israel coordinated aid efforts. conflict said. ""May quite effective"" means possible vaccine slightly less effective, completely ineffective. that's ""**China blocks investigators' access Wuhan** "" post spread it

damn evil Chia evil VISA policies know says that. US, CDC says generally need test afterwards, ending isolation based time symptoms reason test test infectiousness, test positive ""dead virus"" months healthy infectious. pro all. opposite. China scared framed investigators (and West) wrong conclusions, trying hide deliberate conspiracy. 

The virus originated China, seems unlikely anything shady going - initial denial, probably cost whole world. 

Kinda getting tired China conspirators honestly. Yes, they're bad human rights etc. bias insane. like facts, speculation (albeit post, illustrate point). post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The reason Sweden worse hit initial cases far exceeded neighbors measures taken. Danish authorities estimate around 3000 daily cases nationwide early April.

Surely coronavirus dangerous gun violence Chicago’s worse neighborhoods TIL people won’t die often lockdown. Sounds like lockdown new norm. Seems New Jersey, prior infection bumps priority list. true it;s that. Companies like Dyson forced people back offices WFH fine need there. lot companies London still forced people back need. enough people wear masks London tube I've witnessed doesn;t help. cannot people mixed households alone, several factors. Could also new strain. really don’t know anything anything. whole process unorganized mess left us dark times. quality speed travel new, degree, yes. still ""mass gatherings"" 1918 pandemic. held Woodstock another pandemic. statement was, seasons make difference zero cases. zero Covid infect anyone, seasons can't make spread likely, since patient zero spread it. seems like pretty indisputable fact. America even one city population NZ, let alone even single state. What?! bullshit! Everyone knows give money richest trickles people! spreading communism! (/s I've learned highly necessary) one fan predict future, however, things trending right way vaccines. It’ll get there. Try focus control accept without judgement can’t. Right? Without falling political rabbit hole, Biden state local people sitting fucking things? UK island Yea. disconnect data, says lot unused vaccines people able get vaccine. 

I think governments trying force vaccinations up, widening pool. I’m sure really addresses problem. understand it. Moderna basically took risk 1 billion initial funding. Also, Moderna said allow mRNA intellectual property used free pandemic. since Moderna got 1 billion people's money resulting intellectual property public domain benefit greater society.

Also, Astra Zeneca said profit vaccine pandemic. Me, wife, 2 kids. US. March &amp; November. confirmed positives. wife one hit hard 2nd time well. me, 2nd time much mild. times kids runny noses.  UK island anything like home county western NY roughly 90%. fooling anyone yourself, honestly pathetic. facilities able make covid vaccines can't patents intellectual property restrictions?

COVID transmission nothing immigration status considered. questions likely need medical care therefore strain hospital system, likely get spread infection, and, going give vaccines fast possible spend valuable time optimizing vaccinate first, places prepared give largest numbers vaccination. incentive: Wanna keep job ? Get vaccinated.  District District even.

My kids district done absolutely AMAZING job offering option person remote schooling done great both, actively preparing person kids possibly go remote short notice. school 40-50-ish cases, none kids exposed school*. (I paid much attention stats schools.) Towards end semester getting close going full remote, never needed to. enough staff quarantine struggling find subs.

*Could lying this? Yes, numbers always remained 1 2 time (3 one week), snowballing seemed consistent 1-2 families infected time.

The adjacent district bungled things throughout. parents pissed, kids stability, teachers absolutely fried trying make work, kids usually show remote work. planned person A/B schedule, two weeks start year switched remote 2 options, district teachers MS Teams online program run 3rd party company. October started bringing kids person A/B schedule, starting youngest grades. mid-November less week 5-6th graders started person went back full remote. end semester. they're still deciding spring semester leaning heavily towards kids person, except already 3rd party program, that, they're licenses. They're saying teachers available teach kids online anymore. comparable risk risk catching multiplied risk severe (more severe severe reaction vaccine). healthy young people it’s numbers game 1/100k pretty high consider may want vaccinate couple billion people. 

Luckily they’ll know far even chance taking it, since billion people may vaccinated them. may choice vaccine pick lower risk age group example. UK island Also way widespread UK US, anywhere else world.  sorry hear dealing that. relapses completely gut-wrenching. closer answers treatment plan? UK? EU prices must different then, Pfizer 12€ dose, Moderna 14,69€ - far expensive all. Astra Zeneca 1,78€... EU, although geography bit easier. LOL using birth control. Maybe youd feel comfortable teaching older kids, different profession? anyone know similar daily death toll UK despite third reported infections?

Less testing? Different counting methods? ain't wrong nobody wants hear it. stoking embers fear chastised. Sad, that's way sub. yes man fuck egyptian government. 

fuck terrible thing today? terrible things past?

Well UK joke.... care less, benefits cut country mess. received stimulus checks like US doesn’t say lower still accept.

Which tell something, want bound hard numbers beyond 50% baseline. 

The main boundary holding back approval Oxford vaccine quality evidence provided, reported efficacy, still well baseline. curious cause higher reinfection rate? understand reinfection controversial topic, personally know someone reinfected. don't. Pure chance dictates UK would find first virtue testing most. term ""UK variant"" dumb. doubt they'll received bonuses also access others' raw data so.... Sadly, see across spectrum health care. One trauma nurse educators hospital big family gathering. graduated nursing school daughter, who's NICU nurse, traveled together. kills chance getting people stay away risky situations. hope nothing happens NICU kids get put risk.  worked long time (cold) war communism. even mostly worked people remember ""winning"" war.

They *should* offered vaccine. 80+ year olds be, shouldn’t waste time talking economic status. 

Err side vaccines arms. known American Indians, that’s nomenclature. 

You don’t like it? Oh well media manufactures consent right, virus It’s overlooked all, data simply fomite infection possible, infection via airborn aerosol vectors far biggest risk No.

Shkreli bought life sustaining medication competition made 20x expensive, resulting bills $100,000+ per year. People died went bankrupt could enjoy higher profits.

The focused trump american things different culture sad point. Hopefully access mental health support need. Chicago well downswing. Illinois private schools open whole time. Lol movie theatres hardly worry even age sometimes, let alone vaccine Good. people don’t go hospitals general care immunization, don’t great records receive shot. people hesitant go hospital, pandemic.

Data suggests hospitals main bottlenecks, sitting loads vaccines freezers. like supply exceeds ability distribute. demand sure. demand willingness test people near constant basis NYC probably second none, this, there's getting together?

Setting centers change fact seems like NYC vaccination centers cautious group people in. know reasons that. FDA set guidelines, states ability enforce New York (like state NJ) likely enforce even jabbing people better option. 

I feel like best course action window distribution. January, let's say, give hospitals enough vaccinate staff. use within certain frame time, leftover doses move centers. centers open healthcare workers anyone 70 years age. get rid goddamn doses quickly possible.

It's least worth trying, people line wherever there's vaccine. see goes first month adjust accordingly February. Basically, opening lines keeping 2nd shots reserve.

Haha,you silly. third point, realize people dying non covid issues hospitals taking care covid patients. Getting vaccinated save something else happening couldn't/won't get care needed save life.

This shallow throw away language present throughout piece. possible writer misquoted qouted context. many deaths then, tragic. argument requiring people get vaccinated protect underlying health conditions make impossible burning country ground......because one political party letting him. power stop refused over. agree, low number people willing pay amount considering 300 million people. rather couple thousand people pay 10k fund faster rollout, bonus vaccine givers, etc. 

However currently money simply going back pockets corrupted administrators! people needs arrested  think ""freedumb"" fighers U.S. would understand that, given much love fetishize sacrifices military intone ""freedom free"". 

Alas, no. performative B.S. them. wish could proud country again. know much I'd miss it. honest, healthcare workers vaccinated, dumb fucking rules need thrown vaccinations need **100% age-based**.

Um, heard flu vaccine? point vaccine *definitely not* eradicate it, mutates faster make new vaccines - allow people high risk lower chances getting flu, overall reduce burden healthcare systems. end idea COVID.

America first. Americans first. We're fog war we're still clinging linguistic patterns reinforce prejudices make us disregard available evidence. someone says there's ""no data"" ""no evidence"" means hard proof, advocating policy decision favors arbitrarily made ""null hypothesis"" making leap saying evidence. usually true particular case definitely true. stop pretending \*all\* epistemology discovery science follows particular high-school math pattern RCT + + p value. That's science, that's way fairly definitively prove something justified skeptical not.

There evidence supports delayed vaccines reduced dose vaccines; great evidence. evidence comes inference disease/vaccination/immunity models scientists built decades experience human animal models. Experts pretty good idea 3 vaccines delayed 2nd dose 1/2 dose 50% efficacious rigidly following dosing schedule. Hard proof either way there, late. interim?

In fog war, intuition guesses best scientists area ""Null Hypothesis"". accurate say evidence depriving 1/2 potentially vaccinatable population next months diseases peak lucky 1/2 get double dose? say yes. comes question framed. know it’s US variant went UK? evidence natural-acquired immunity needs taken consideration vaccine rollout public policy strategies. needs strong leader trying time? kick road road ends! run right well drastic. flip breakers. even triggered, actually, I'm pointing laughable countries fucked similar ways. funny. hate other, yet act alike, ironic.

I'd advise unclench. know, kids home learning. state voted Biden obviously communists trying steal election. We're seeing now. 80 million cases past year, many confirmed reinfections been? Yes. 

It's anonymous, based ""friends"", tailor feed way intrudes day day life bullshit things like shared calendars.

UV intensity sunlight intensity general go winter. days also shorter. Viral particles also degrade faster higher temperatures. article focuses humidity though, factor probably works *against* transmission winter since breath condensation fall ground faster warmer dryer environment. test positive 3 months first getting sick. know someone several months later, completely fine physically still testing positive.

If tested positive, tested negative, tested positive again... would mean likely got re-infected there's real evidence yet.

I think likely virus never left bodies completely re-attacked. I'm weary ""re-infections happen"" headlines never actually show people ever tested negative infections.

There needs data whether virus still body re-infections. Short lockdown life almost completely normal except arriving country. think still wear masks public transport, that’s it. 
Secret go hard early, virus takes hold... Norway well, almost perfectly middle road results terms Covid deaths per capita, ranking 110 220 countries worldometer.

They also relatively light restrictions. vaccines higher success preventing severe symptoms complete immunity. Getting mild symptoms lot better going intensive care.

Wtf talking lol. U.S Prison labor almost always voluntary unless something like community service simple, China FORCED it. prisoners committed crimes people, China ideology, even without action, gets imprisoned. 

Concentration camps kids? mean juvenile detention centers? go fighting, stealing, dealing drugs etc. danger kids.

And cant legally torture harvest organs like prisoners China. cruel unusual punishment, that's human right. 

Mass surveillance generally used stop criminals U.S, China used social credit scores, target people wrong ideology, suppress citizen journalism, arrest government critics etc. 

Law enforcement, U.S prison system, etc. worked towards reformed whereas China government gaining power, laws becoming crippling. ironic America criticises China things America's government often does. That's ironic. Yes, spelling you. Perhaps keep masks distancing. first time years one family brought illness home school. school policy sending sick kids home parents refuse answer calls school.

Really, valid reinfections rates absurdly rare it’s fair skeptical would say less dense populated countries probably able manage even high death population ratio populous place supplies running CA many sick people Latvia, Croatia, Norway (which pretty light mandates global comparison), Slovenia, Taiwan (which didn’t lock down) average deaths year. isn’t super rare, New Zealand best this. Croatia widest margin. level 3 &amp; 4, allowed funerals 10 people. level 2, allowed 50 people. reported cases people bringing larger groups, got lucky majority followed rules. want fun country, unkown number cases vaccine given... wrong. proper protocol (wrong needles, subcutaneous instead muscular, etc) instructions health ministry different Pfizer ones. ? one knows.

Covid definitely attacks liver kidneys, still pale stool ever since sick (a sign liver isnt producing bile) 

Without bile dont really digest well, especially fat soluble vitamins like vitamin d. actually stop taking vitamin cuz making stomach hurt.

But digress, throwing there, found treatment (iron b vitamins) ive heart problems sudden sleep awakenings since. guess people forget actually vaccinate virus disease causes. Rubeola causes Measels, vaccinate rubeola- vaccinate Measels.

Originally thought yes sure anymore research. sources said yes sources claimed test may show negative results even vaccine working vaccine induced antibodies IgG infection. two weeks flatten curve. Counterpoint: Vaccines work creating antibodies. Identical? Probably not. monoclonal antibody drugs vaccines work primarily targeting spike protein, significantly mutated SA strain.

It make doomer observe worth paying very, close attention to. Even current SA variant resistant vaccines, evolutionary speaking existence makes lot likely resistance-granting mutations arise, especially virus exposed strong selective pressure vaccines. coordination world mess. UK Israel far done right. might think US mess vaccinated far, far people average European country. Denmark vaccinations 10 days given one single person. France - less 0.01% population. sirens silence never forget it. properly fitted seal checked N99 N100 respirator combined ventless goggles absolutely ensure come contact enough airborne pathogens cause problem.

Trying keep cultures alive also stupid. Times change people need adapt. agree sentiment - however really possible practice. can't imagine western societies refusing medical service people chose vaccinated - unfortunately rest society suffer burden increased strain continue put health care services. guess comes need need save life, there’s (ends justify means).

Good lord, keep political agenda opening NOW... said vaccine implemented planned (100 million first 100 days-not sure that's people doeses tho) Congress approves enough money equip teachers students necessary equipment (PPE, air filtration, course vaccinations), not? Again? seem unable get people vaccinated first time around. believe late ordering Moderna vaccine(and small quantity), expecting deliveries March. Therefore make sense approve already. First made sense drug authorization agency use resources looking vaccines actually able deploy immediately(the Oxford/AZ one). Secondly politically, would also highlight UK coming ""late party"" particular vaccine, obviously interested in(and also pointless explained above).

Here India multiple elections/Biggest festival year/protest still cases declining steadily last 3 months..  make sense. need critical care would die without it, half people need critical care die virus. people dying means need critical care.  remember reading story early pandemic elderly woman stayed home time, groxeries delivered contactlessly etc, see friends family. Unfortunately onenday got door knocker answered door. Bam, got covid. takes one. It’s lightly populated isolated island. couldn’t one could. Would happen know FFs want get it? they're anti-vaxxers, think they're healthy enough need it, feel uncertain vaccine's safety? saving Biden takes office. Everything political point anyone else bring someone hospital Covid? I've heard hospitals right treating giving oxygen. Would better stayed home family actually help person? argument hospital needs elective procedures stay business treat covid bit stretch. COVID causes hospital go business shut down, reducing COVID caring capacity mid-pandemic, would likely response layers government support it. Or, people ask government.

Saying business elective procedures offers community businesses highly debatable. Department store - yeah quite likely... Grocery store? clear. Based track records, 2 week lockdown anywhere actually 2 weeks? I'll admit know little Israel's past policy decisions this. I’ve probably reading many newspapers match/april. wide array countries. Including Sweden. stood early, especially since didn’t find healthy exchange ideas saw elsewhere. tried seemed attacked media. one Tegnell admiration, T-shirts, tattooes...it beyond reason, looked like cult. hidden sort nationalism play, superior sence. 

Sorry say, there’s indikation Finland/Norway’s Health workers stressed usual. Little none regular hospital activity reduced. Denmark might different situation recent spike though, far seems warnings bar full.

I’m sure Belgiums statistic would look lot better removed Brussels equation, Copenhagen together. Suggesting removing Stockholm stats ballpark. even that, would find even remote scarcely populated areas Sweden many times infection/death cases compared Finland/Norway whole. mimics virus without causing infection spreading. Adjuvants cause enhanced response immune system.

Other I'm sure. true vaccines too, that's current recommendation everyone get vaccinated regardless prior infection. would without fancy new strain. OG strain bad enough. No, didn’t take like that. bought masks whole family minus baby keep front door car (then there’s never awkward moment forgetting them). Hundreds per location sweetheart shit. turned several states known sources. Unknown community spread generally means widespread Let go, story Egypt us! Everything isnt politics. poor souls hospital, nurses; horrible feeling loose someone, whole room cant imagine. enough vaccines make dent disease target risk hospitalization death. way really speed open everyone. Florida they've allowed like 25% population first priority group vaccinating faster. first world democracy Presidential system government 

France also presidential republic really true all. They're talking seeking open schools safely first 100 days. can't that, won't. 

[The president-elect said promise dependent Congress providing sufficient funding protect returning students, teachers campus plan said final decisions reopening schools would fall state local officials nonetheless promised enlist federal agencies establish “basic, objective criteria” so. included districts securing necessary funding reconfigure classrooms better social distancing, procuring protective equipment devising plans accommodate at-risk teachers students.

Biden’s comments praise nation’s two major teachers unions. Much he’s proposed aligns approach previously offered American Federation Teachers, called national mask mandate, wider virus testing funding make buildings safer. ""works assumption county-reported case counts undercount actual infections,""

So say wrong make headline? carbon monoxide make dead oxygen? post Christmas effect sense states reporting backlogged deaths reported holidays. Pretty clear look veey unnatural huge dip time. Taiwannews.com.tv, hk.appledaily.com, theepochtimes.com. ""Best"" tabloid media world.
In fact, really ""media""? stronger immune system, damage cytokine storm body. Dont forget researching prions.  Im sorry hear that.

It really amazes Trump appeal base (legal immigration health professionals AKA ""good kind immigrants"") opposition (more opportunities citizens developing countries). Bro it’s air breath lmao Thanks. Obviously catching COVID-19 risky. 

What vaccine trains immune system better real virus? Yeah, said read preprint, spreading it. Thank clarification though! really hope don’t. Volunteer Pfizer's Phase 3 trial, got back August/September. Looks like idk they've published since still pre Correct areas even know pandemic going on. Unanswered question: many people U.S. possibly permanent loss smell? 10,000? 100,000? 1,000,000? need bribe idiots take vaccine. mean, examples pretty extreme no. rate usually 0.00001% sth around number. 10%. largely ruled time. ruled likely suspects said possibilities extremely low probability events likely happen again. got unlucky, worst case scenario. 

Based area population happened in, suspect cleaner quarantine hotels became asymptomatic carrier spread illegal immigrant community South Auckland people afraid get tested due immigration status. Thus patient zero found. Wait, Shkreli give free 
an insurance it? think does. mean prizes motivate FFs get vaccinated? Also, please learn difference coincidence irony. know yet.  classic ""last mile"" problem. Supply distribution exceeding ability give shots.

The solution seems pretty obvious, sites giving shots hours. places Florida like 75 100 appointments per day open 6 hours. That's completely ridiculous. 24/7 double triple normal staff. Lol think taking time write batshit crazy comment like means you’re normal? mean... hate putting people detect sarcasm. compared 1 200 chance dying horrible death alone hospital catch vaccine. Even pace 100 million people 100days, general public may get first dose probably late May, right?

You can't, fucking bullshit. honestly stopped long quote pulled, couldn't! know Malaysia cosplay convention going on... Conservative subs strangest thing. defend donald bitter end quote one tweets suddenly ban worthy. think biggest problem pandemic.. we're hiding sick dying people away, giving people false impression severity... Apart fact irrelevant, redundancies would found richer countries afford rather poorer ones. Yeah listening sounds way like he's speaking predictions people behaving vs. gov't enforcing capacity restrictions. fair point suppose, although I've said elsewhere sub, places ""taken care"" COVID, e.g. NZ, China, Taiwan, big events like concerts parties again, say. 

If think masks Dec. year hard think also believes still capacity/gathering restrictions event closures.  use limited cancer treatments small number years now, I'm sure I'd call use case ""vaccine"" per say. source shows Hessen Berlin, though. dig data Destatis whole Germany. Really enjoying sanity comments post. enjoy this, 2020 worst year life past thirty-six years. would love get older I'm realist less Optimus 2020 left little optimism. mean start argument anybody here. People think someone posts bad news want whole world end, that's want. would suggest find reputable doctor hitch wagon to. Ethos valuable part argument persuasion, using ""expert"" know engage bad faith arguments vaccinations help call data transparency. Man whose name know got radical medical treatment says better trust doctors. Noted. feel bad laughing, something definitely needs done scale vaccinations get control  reply comment available doses EU.

edit: sure much need vaccinate people 3rd world countries we're done? 2022 earliest point many countries passed natural herd immunity long time.  Depends, really. folks, life really change much even pandemic onset lockdowns &amp; restrictions, probably care much restrictions prolonged. Good make work, sometimes get little cocky expect everyone else adapt lifestyle little issues year even lose mind when, believe not, considerable amount population can't live like that! Imagine that. matter anybody tries spin it, way live. least we're alive, right? could know? virus 6 months old! could literally end tomorrow!

Like said another thread could say “there won’t 20,000 covid deaths tomorrow” armchair scientist would say “you can’t say you’re making things that’s science works!” feel extremely frustrating. get feeling there's also element pandering anti-vaxxer idiots. UK example, people willing refuse vaccine low 20%, one lowest Europe, means luxury able go faster. Germany around 30%, France high 40% (which ridiculous), reason probably want give slightest reason people doubt vaccines, that's coming cost many lives.  Asymptomatic spread far less previously thought according WHO. health care workers want vaccine? People social beings human nature want socialize. fine ask people go human nature short time, asking people go human nature long period guaranteed fail. Breaking news: 95% efficacy mean 100%.

In news: immune vaccine injected. problem there's obviously huge percentage population affected, i.e. 50% example. problem relatively cases over-inflating per-capita numbers much smaller population.

For example, NYC 25309 deaths population 8.3M, 0.3%.

For hometown 2000, 0.3% means need 6 deaths per-capita worse NYC. pandemic spreads, 6 dead almost year would actually pretty admirable.

Or take daily deaths, like outrider567 did. NYC 25 new deaths yesterday, 0.0003%. hometown *single* COVID death yesterday, pushing 5 6, it'd worse NYC daily *and* total death rate, making absolutely unfair per-capita comparison. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

IMHO. behind TWIV podcasts. wondering Vincent's take this. find really incredible considering delaying 2nd dose. living life fear? don’t know day day basis. knew someone go lol wrong Scott Gottlieb gave interview CNBC back first week November estimated actual daily infections probably 500,000 compared 150,000 confirmed. multiplier probably holds now. right... immunity black white, add this, productive conversation also define 'immunity'. 100% protection? even year (see prison population reinfections, far fraction percent). 50% protection? Well, even doomer articles earlier year ('people get reinfected common cold coronaviruses multiple times, SARS-2') study referenced mentioned still got infected significantly less even 5 years, though nowhere near 100%.

I think almost guaranteed see level protection even years. population allowed it. Enjoy lockdowns peeps. stage americans forget buying ppe start stocking body bags caskets instead. May ask life?

'World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said two members investigative team already left home countries Wuhan, agreed advance China, became clear Beijing issued necessary permission team enter country.'

Where say never applied for? 

Either way - China agreed enter refused entry knowing for. suspect rude. Link? Month 5, whipped.

Leaders thinking far longer term this. Btw believe locking terrible choice believe not. mean much information jab's lasting immunity either. approved without knowledge long term immunity, includes USA. irresponsible data?

It's gamble. calculated risk, one authorities UK calculated worth it. Based knowledge current data vaccine, chances failure low benefit derived delaying second jab massive. Hotel? Trivago Ya 100m pretty reasonable. death rate less 5/1000, they're closing 500k deaths. 500k deaths 100m infections, meaning elderly get vaccinates, deaths going dramatically decrease. It'll probably start become non issue like 2 3 months, assuming start like million vaccinations day. They're going really close heard immunity assuming reinfection significantly less lethal. last major pandemic 2009, H1N1 remember? What's wrong opening schools vaccination widely available?  Denmark vaccinations 10 days given one single person.

You sure this? Last checked they're 5th 6th globally terms % population vaccinated. Accouring ourworldindata they're 0.85%, best European country UK. low life. areas high rates? medical gas (breathing air, oxygen, nitrous oxide etc) classified medical drugs it’s manufactered hospital needs follow standard testing drugs made factory 

In sweden one hospital close one section/floor particles caused newly welded pipes either overseas citizens 90 million citizens country. new strain dangerous ""clean"" places like Taiwan Vietnam places already widespread community transmission strains. new strain 70% higher transmission rate potentially punch existing quarantine measures start new chain transmissions Vietnam. UK done job kept new strain control new proven quarantine procedures new strain established globally, Vietnam literally cant afford bring back new strains. There’s 22-23,000 deaths covid people aged 54 younger. ages- that’s arguing. less driving, that’s besides point comparison. 

Maybe diseases aren’t infectious deadly people age range. 

As last point, can’t put number that? I’m saying group virus truly deadly vaccinated, start open up. people left vaccinated 99.999% survival rate, it’s ridiculous keep world shut down. mention shut downs lot effects people too- mentally, economically, physically. That's good well, much information first jab's lasting immunity, look good first 10 days first jab either. AstraZeneca's case, know anything sure, since botched phase III trial. vaccine would like have, sadly one trust least point.

We use first jab ... mean ""we hope can"". basing conclusion assumptions dispute. hope right, gamble. Mmkay shared views, don’t go conspiracy India actually surged summer well Ya first wave way counted. Back then, Canada like 7% death rate US 2% death rate. Basically Canadians next testing compared Americans pointing ""disaster south border"" US good data outbreak. pretty infuriating see Canadians basically nothing implement soft border restrictions assumption USA problem gave excuse ignore problem here. best guess per capita infections US little less double infection rate, back everyone Canada acting like even here. Maybe perspective bit got infected back deal hospital unwilling test without China doctors telling could take mask hospital coughing. restaurant son works employee positive test. know owner allowed tell anybody not, really think I'll ever eat again.

I see anything Facebook informing customers. 

It's got 10-12 tables, waitress would walking past literally everybody. none apparently told exposure. May already happened South Africa Opposite way round
You want moisture aviation oxygen may freeze high altitude cold clarify girlfriend Vietnamese. Trudeau french, Americans British. im sorry wish best recovery. wish knew else say. year!?!? Surely Vietnamese government can’t abandon citizens long. soul soul think restrictions loosen UK finished least 80% vaccination program. year least. Sorry stuck UK.  shit suspend? I'm antivax, know. let discourage getting covid vaccine. PPE effective short period time. Hence doctors etc catching it. 
If resident doesn’t want get wouldn’t danger since staff nurses would vaccinated still wearing PPE. 
When sign nurse you’re signing protect people. vaccine cancer everyone would take it. disease nee doesn’t mean vaccine mandatory nurses. 
Residents live there, therefore wouldn’t spreading other. nurses ( would go point home ) they’d alone segregated catching virus. per capita basis, Iceland worse New Zealand, Singapore Hong Kong, despite remote island low population still great lol. iceland population distribution almost unbelievable. 60% population 1% land area Reykjavik. sum largest NZ cities even get near Vietnam many densely populated cities also managed situation seems virus hard time surviving hot humid areas. That, lot Asian countries handling pandemic well, obviously. differs state state kind misleading headline, restrictions eased days. article said second incident type happen Egypt
Just horrible would article make think that's good idea?  know, OP actually right. contagious pre-symptomatic period, applies viral illnesses too. Also, vaccine necessarily grant immunity, gives far better chance beating infection, point may asymptomatic. data show prevents infection outright. Belgium Ireland inflate numbers even including ""suspected covid deaths"" absence even positive test result.  think kind harsh comment yeah it’s pretty clear point another lot people mentally overcome fact getting back normal soon. know it’s hard thing accept accept like I’d recommend going outside seeing world considering world doesn’t give rats ass atm Source/Link? data means data. data support point point. act absence data. err side caution. data masks work, start mask, hurt. data surface transmission, clean. data cavidad work dosage, give bashir full dosage.

They play around Oxford vaccine ""data"" pretty much dosage. one, nah

Also approve moderna, seem less objectionable experiment Attorney's can't believe pudding-brain things pudding-brained? asymptomatic people still spread it. ""sick"". understanding know vaccine makes asymptomatic stops deathly ill totally stops spreader. Every time new variant comes see least nothingburger type articles. unfortunate. mechanisms described necessarily incorrect, unique SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. general description viral mutation works, nothing specific mutations seeing. known sure long immunity typically lasts, expected several years. See, e.g., Year late aren’t wrong. Honestly, article wrong. least exactly correct. definite cases reinfection, think everyone wants grasping onto anything could make happen. hopeful people immune longer months, honestly, don’t think know yet. hope recovered recovering well, sure articles like extremely frustrating experience. Everyone ready agree already decided opinion actually try listen others. It’s become difficult actual discussion. Exactly feel like nothing life. realize could lot worse off, job disappeared Covid kind feel like I'm flailing lately.  Trying preserve languages important part keep culture alive. culture almost gone. personal experience, shunned taking Ojibway lessons kind regret it. would’ve cool talk grandmother way talked hers. trying preserve many indigenous cultures can, otherwise end one homogenous lump. Language important part expression. 25k still absolute joke, least million? according high school friend Facebook watched YouTube video Unpopular opinion: challenge trials soon phase one completed vaccine candidate. guess US sudden explosion mainly due UK variant. remember mid September India course surpass US within 10 days...But weeks later things turned drastically.

Now India half cases compared US. McConnell skillful keeping party line. see supported 2k stimulus turn around claim can't afford hidden cost Covid slowdowns... that's we've seen West fact matter risk death otherwise healthy person extremely high. vulnerable vaccinated therefore removed chain propagation, death hospitalization numbers begin plummet. we're months away measurable. true sadly. Heartbreaking. mortgage 4800?! Pfizer conduct clinical trials children 11-15 April. summer age group may authorized. unlikely we'll immunize younger children next year.

I can't link article said EUA committee review. good? Honest answer please. missed April. Interesting article. young people *do* severe cases. few, interesting cases. think Doctors Health Bureaucrats need stop making predictions human behaviour psychology, they're completely touch. say video probably mask mandates next fall/winter, I'm assuming he's speaking behavioural restrictions stand point. it’s common sense all. 1000 died hometown 2000, would insane say “you can’t say it’s worse nyc nyc many people”

We use percentages specifically they’re compare groups different sizes realize everyone disagrees alt right antimasker right?

You realize irrelevant people whole behave like morons even fined it? you. Never was. Regardless, harm math? Either you’re right don’t anything, you’re wrong lives get saved. either hurt feelings?

Because nurtures shitty ""well let's shaft poor countries solve it, like mattered anyway"" mindset limiting problem mathematical matter disregarding ethical issues whole thing. issue purely statistical one. size (per square mile)

I figure that's uncommon, places world area one square mile per square mile Questions:

1. long immunity *typically* last people recovering COVID-19?
2. long immunity *typically* last people vaccinated?
3. significant difference answers Q1 Q2, science behind it? Yeah, pathetic... Unless got test didn’t get covid. Thanks confused lol thought Florida rather well vaccine distribution discriminatory, possible. like saying allowed entrance black, 65. want fascist regulations? Whoever take vaccine, free take responsibility. likely happen, may issues getting similar support influenza pandemic mutates big enough match 1918. still due bad flu. partisan pattern makes low stability policies could, find lot people speak English speak Dutch second language. want live better learn French. receiving oxygen antibiotics? sepsis, turn leads cause death (such end organ failure). Failure treatment cause death. doctor, I've fill many death certificates whereas clearly seen death certificate even looks like. Donate blood.

There place area gives free antibody tests donation. months back trouble. Real ID drivers licenses require proof citizenship lawful presence. would think significant proportion population Unknown. look less lethal though. that's case need close non essential buisness. Since everything still open seems messages fine go out. kid died people maskless protesting ""not able see friends"", vision would certainly clouded, yep. would probably clouded rage. immunity vaccine last long could that's extremely unlikely, ""restrictions"" we'll dealing next winter would *extremely* localized quarantine there's outbreak reservoir unvaccinated people people noticing vaccine requires production large amounts live virus manufacturing.
All good security tight... true approaching herd immunity soon.

If actual COVID case count 10X reported number (in low-middle range estimates), we're 210 million cases U.S. now, 65% population. estimates said 20X, would put us 130% population. university good pretty good too. getting flooded dose I’ll see manage. Honestly, thinking get tested whether covid not. 

I 2 days really really bad fatigue really strong headache October, rest times workday (glad work home).

Now thinking might've covid. want pay hundred dollars check. Don’t post crap  try lifting weights might help attitude brother. know rare get again.

Of 4 friends house caught last summer -

1 friend lost taste/smell 2 weeks recovered. 1 bed ridden 3-4 days. 2 ill loss taste/smell. sure got tested assumed got it.

They recently came contact someone visiting London (not sure long), they're ill again.

The girl lost taste/smell tested positive again, well housemate became ill. Also wrong, 2 waiting results (1x bed ridden, 1x ill loss taste/smell)

So girl lost taste/smell 100% got again, well 1x ill. 2 waiting results currently ill too.

(also sorry yeah I'm making /s) Florida got vaccine supply based population. residency requirement get vaccine. Senior Florida residents also competing anyone 65+ ability travel. 

Vaccine tourism arrived. Good point. guess care Dad dies early works restaurant business Florida everyone pretends Covid exist.

We see light end tunnel, time stop taking seriously. clearly said 20 million vaccinated. Stop moving goalposts. Oh yeah, single person claimed screwed up. typically America. Lie deny lying. Maybe missed part said “do part”. means everything, wearing mask calling day. That’s small, tiny part content posted. also referring people taking advantage different situations agenda follow guidelines. much want businesses open normal life again, it’s becoming impossible ignorant people following simple rules. examples: wearing face mask? Nope, people wearing mouth, nose. Quarantining? Nope, people want party, travel, large crowds. small things big things, spreading virus more. Regardless fatality chance, don’t want work, lose family member friend, certainly don’t want spread virus anymore.

LMAO you’re funny honestly. “You’re stupidity showing inability read”, yet use wrong form your. anyone’s joke, it’s using insults arguments seeing people taking different takes things. Nobody going hear actually side you’re insulting them.

Can show doctors think COVID joke? seems most, all, take seriously also put lives line treat patients COVID. sounds like proved point schools closed govt provide n95s teachers students.
*insert congrats played meme* It’s good news 7 Million people... you’d rather vaccine get trashed? It’s like someone line rich guy went got someone else didn’t get shot would have. would course wrong. what’s happening I’d agree wrong. it’s well connected donor getting access wasted doses think it’s good thing. need rich people vaccinated much poor people. need tons vaccinated. giving wasted one rich people means hospitals also better funded help poor people also good thing. 

These extra doses something like 30 minute window get administered. r/Coronavirus telling us China amazing could wrong cause controlled covid. yeah myocarditis also pretty well-known complication flu infections occurs something like 7-10% cases. sure similar incidence covid seems like would quit working pandemic started could get without money. working, would taking box fans MERV filters, opening windows getting fans flow air out. employees would help. argue businesses paying new ventilation systems, health, would put money efforts help everyone stay safe. better wearing coat work windows open, catch potential deadly disease. vaccine expert found addition pain injection site headache, severe side effects listed ""more likely occur,"" high blood pressure, loss vision, loss taste, delayed menstruation, ***urinary incontinence.***

&amp;#x200B;

great. ***STILL*** can't go store. Sorry everyone seems believe simply *having* NHS means I'm saying country ""better"" us. That's implication. could, should, better. undeniable well-implemented public health plan could made us better able vaccinate quickly. Israel easy example there's absolutely reason efficient per-capita. Absolutely reason. certain ""scientist"" may fact okay thing. Collectively though, science works! original article Ming Pao think Ming Pao pro Beijing Airlines made lot lobby UK, Oxford virologists said let virus spread best strategy. Everyone saying treatment got unaffordable others. sincerely ask without snarky replies unaffordable treatment is? mean relative average American, relative worst case scenario would uninsured + poverty line. know many major insurance companies waiving costs related coronavirus insured patients. Misleading title... click bait bullshit. article 'does' clarify still shitty mislead title. Beyond March 1 year, hard call temporary measures point instead adapting way life virus. support that. got suspicious amount Instagram stories packed indoor NYE parties Portugal... colour surprised. :| Anyone know compares Moderna Pfizer vaccines? Nothing free side effects. condoms makes sterile ...every cloud Phew, go back distributing leisurely pace. realize everyone disagrees alt right antimasker right? I’m literally wearing two masks right (we required wear thin procedure mask customer, wear employer provided kn95 it)

And that’s specifically mentioned Southeast Asia, region whole rather stellar response this.

Regardless, harm math? Either you’re right don’t anything, you’re wrong lives get saved. either hurt feelings? Surprise! Immunity lasts least two three years...you know...just like respiratory virus. two companies disclosing legally using vaccine way. lawsuit go nowhere. sue uk government? able to. hope emergency authorization shield it. guy answered like knew answers things. You’re asking questions bud take daily multivitamin 2 additional D3 supplements. Due miscalculation recently realized daily value closer 9000 UI needed. take 3000 UI per day supplement diet. Oh shit Obama get third term? Taiwannews extremist anti-China tabloid. Take Taiwanese national. first bullet point link says ""A test-based strategy longer recommended determine discontinue home isolation, except certain circumstances."". RT PCR rates ICMR website man, clearly pushing goalposts. guy sent state, barring delhi every state 85%+ RT PCR. 

Also excess deaths related reported infection rate, fact used determine infections under-reported. 

Educate passing statements like this. Hey FYI reddit app thing right comment added inexplicable rant apparently nobody except contributing society. think need escape line breaks something fix that? similar - heat in/out going different places.

Welcome Reddit, people never traveled home country experts foreign affairs. [...] traveling freely (and naively) within without China led propagation virus worldwide pandemic.

It seems implying China reacted faster could prevented spread virus around world. previous comment said virus likely spreading since September 2019. little doubt virus already outside China first case detected Wuhan, global lockdowns would still needed prevent spread early on. 

You may already forgotten, remember vividly time China welding people's doors Wuhan enforce lockdown western governments absolutely nothing prepare. knew coming nothing. absurd blame China this. want blame someone blame government. anything, China praised ability contain disease even though, unlike rest world, warning. jury duty common thing? I've never heard anybody Australia.

I even want imagine I'd explain sleep like normal people can't reliably predict I'll awake functional normal people hours, make entire work life revolve around problem little ability explain others try. 20s could power day two sleeping feel like death, thirties less fit think might actually health hazard. That's good question. idea. paraphrase Wanda Sykes Chris Rock Show ep, ""don't nobody live there! huge stretch igloos &amp; polar bears!"" least they're providing legitimate sources back arguments, snarky comment no. many times seen play already... china, italy, new york... think way better honest people maintain credibility, get someone would soft pedal it. like that's we're getting comments moving goalposts. Definitely Western media click-baity titles China? Wow, would thought? /s think that's very, pessimistic prediction. 
We probably get close 400,000 end month. would need see 100,000 dead month get million June. 
Even horrible start vaccine rollout get better soon. people getting vaccinated first ones much higher chance dying. naturally result less deaths among vulnerable cause numbers go down. believe relatively moderate infections per capital, LA metro area well 15 million people, even moderate rate infections per capita means huge number sick people. Hospitals designed staffed many sick people.  know real answer would speculate BC healthier population. Lowest obesity Canada 16% population vs. 42% US. scientifically proven effect reducing transmissibility. Oh fuck Israel, stop making everybody look bad. Healthiest province Canada. California must reported today- number yesterday yet know least one person got vax :p Yipes. Takes 12 days vaccine start effective. 4 weeks (both injections) reach peak efficacy. Kind interesting article mentions 137 countries signed Australia's investigation include US sign it. Seems like that’s bound stop point.  One would hope adequately masked appropriately wary degenerates now.  need 3-4 million per day make end year. 1 million per day failure. good enough! 

The government (DoD HHS) 6 months plan logistics roll-out distribution. Total failure. disaster rate immunization drastically increase. Quickly! We’re certainly giving lot rolls dice try though Hospitalizations, cases, relevant metric here. Thanks. I’m working pay recently restored (had take cut six months). Going little stir crazy, living bad COVID area, far good. know people worse, I’m lucky. Good luck you, eventually us all! fine end March. perfect need last 3 months. Intuitively there's lot overlap 'girl boss' 'do research' crowd amongst nurses There’s man two Nobel prizes advocates drinking piss cure depression Seriously though supposed get groceries? everyone delivery. I’m high school teacher. see students rooting you. Hang ❤️ future mutation little effect boomers extremely deadly millennial age groups

that makes zero sense. immune system better younger are. takes energy recover get older. deadly millennial age groups, death warrant lot boomers. It’s easy attack argument. Problem is, going comment history many others beat see intention dropping falsehoods. Wouldn’t even allowed one approved 16+ one 18+. D-FENS Viruses survival goals. mutation spread among humans high lethality would also end virus' destruction, ability stop say 'whoops, nvm, going alter proteins, bad!' 

And even killed humans, still evolutionary dead end, virus thrives multiple animal hosts. time virus replicates, there's chance mutation occur. mutation impact all? That's entirely random.


Some survive either impact species don't. mutations die b/c cause early death, infertility, make impossible virus replicate, host animal dies suddenly passing virus along.

We hope random errors deadly humans, minimize chance mutations limiting virus' spread. don’t need forced wall. government needs remove red tape real government aid came people still need work survive. You’re attacking person can’t attack argument.

The video proof there. I’m asking listen commentary. Mute like. pictures proof. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Pass whatever smoking want kind impurities have? lethal getting nothing all? agree, that's unfortunately sucks responsible people continue bear responsibility watch others will. 

I appreciate it. really tough, that's kind nature things. struggle days also lot luxuries like ability stay home stay safe remembering grateful helps balance out. 

Hope dealing ok well. Hope better days us coming months. mRNA vaccines certainly will, depend targeting portion spike protein DNA changed sequenced variant far. defendant one needed wear mask chance protection. dollar system maintained, military.
How get goods print money. US it. Maybe we'll need work yge imagination soon.   understanding used trials vaccines - competition change - that’s produced vaccine quick. exact thing happened years ago ( sure hit America ) swine flu. got vaccine quick took it. far know, I’m 99% sure, serious side effects. Unless that’s alcoholics haha. really don’t think there’s need worry. It’s cash grab far see believe put Putin. Putin announced months ago vaccine. Obviously everyone thought lying. it, another word. Oliver Stone took ago turns it’s rolled Russia barely making headlines ( it’s compulsory ). Again, think goes back live trust companies, lawsuits etc. Right vaccine Pfizer one. It’s getting rolled slowly way administered ( two jabs two weeks apart ). 

And besides this, I’m leaving crazy people every country thing 5G trackers etc vaccine. Ironically see mostly Facebook 🙄 even read article? 🤣 Meanwhile rest world envious..Greets ""new hard Lockdown Germany"" find full report? found report fda Remindme! Jan 1 2023  big brains telling us Florida reached herd immunity? need huge sample size effect noticeable. want measure action safer action b 1.5% yeah need lot participants find full report EMA covid 19 apparently approved vaccin im interested reading it. found report fda really want read EMA report perogative course. That's science talks Pool COVID == great band name Yes, reporting like straight irresponsible. People actually know science realize still small chance people don’t simply read 10x use means getting vaccinated telling people it’s dangerous. risky, already going &amp; socializing meeting friends/classmates, nothing that's comfort zone. Plus assume 25, likely crippled car accident suffer long-lasting damage covid. lucky you, Korea requires foreign travelers quarantine special hotels (literally house arrest, outside contact) 2 weeks pass covid test. odds passing anything elderly grandparents would nil. welcome. We're turning it.  Jeez, blanket statements ‘what America’ like it’s one big homogenous country. 

States sovereign. 50 different reactions Covid ... be. works New York doesn’t mean works Montana Again, that’s assessment think long timeline. 

Just based confirmed infections, factoring severe enough case long term effects may likely, it’s going take long time get 2 billion dead. virus likely become less lethal common. several vaccine candidates awaiting final results emergency use approval, significantly increase vaccine availability. solve issue enough trained people administer though become another bottleneck administering it.

Dr. Fauci claims we'll reach level normalcy fall goal million vaccinations day; extrapolate numbers looking half population U.S. getting two-dose regimen around Thanksgiving. Politicians going pressured saying that's enough pull restrictions mandates point. Yeah it’s bullshit. whole rhetoric bandwidth one kind issue nonsensical attack rollout stringent enough getting enough people time. less stringent rules, quicker doses administered. pissed EU citizen agree accurate description.

However biggest problem lies vaccination itself,
Like hell going wrong france, 500 vaccination week, seriously?

This serious problem countries trying best fight pandemic like germany, shengen borders open nations wide open. Covid stars stripes edition willing bet threaten fire 40% teachers bend come work. Viruses mutate time 99% become less deadly time

Wow, heard that, I'd certainly love true. I'm trying find source talks this; one handy? Thank god keep mind people making money fear, incentive stoke it. think fair say cognitive decline caused widespread infection first place. one going move manufacturing China disease originated there.

There mentions Japanese news products, feasibility actual sustainability move yet known. Political priorities. seems one side likes talk China's failures side likes talk (the US) failures. feel talk one downplay other. think is? People seen many apocalyptic movies that’s expect? See book Entangled Life. Spanish flu infected even remote places imagine. Smallpox moved faster European explorers Americas. wish could live Vietnam right now... Also omitted said current vaccines work without modification, future mutations require observations. Low quality clickbait article. ""wrong people""? everyone supposed get vaccine eventually? upwards 750 billion dollars go military yearly, didn’t deify people might start question days ago thread sub we'd reach 500K US deaths month. like lot people, reaction skepticism. sound absurd...  he’s joking SA severe? hadn’t heard that. well yeah isn’t option first come first serve clock winding down. say we're dreaming. German here. talk way. don’t want read it: headline misleading. Fauci didn’t issue warning definitely official sense. Basically said SA strain probably already be, can’t prove yet variations virus expected able managed vaccines. comparing yourself, adult post-graduate student, little kids age 12? Little kids discipline focus sit Zoom lessons hours. wander away, break cry. 64-75 March. health conditions. Looks like everyone else wait May.  That's says. Employers administering vaccine careful questions go CVS Walgreens. employer may also require doctor's note saying cannot get vaccine without disclosing reason why. read head Liam Neeson's voice Taken. Even best case scenario 100% global compliance tomorrow, huge wave ready - effects post-COVID syndrome wreak society.

Could provide link that? also ""could"" better prepared Pandemic, statement means nothing.  chance sudden emergence mutated variant totally evades immunity

It's spreading unabated full calendar year, minimum. nothing sudden described source concern. 'The virus' huge entity one genetic code mutates once. gazillions small particles, genetic code.

There lots disabling mutations every second, particles survive. takes 'good' mutation reproduce faster replace others. coming next: 12 lawsuits court system reckless negligence, lost time work, etc. time spent jury, comes standard -- I'm talking jurors got sick quarantine trial, thanks exposure would happened state, idiots would stood around wondering do, let spoil. well! It’s decently livable.. kids. Hey, really appreciate that. fine. learned long time ago cope symptoms, gotten pretty good it. pretty good coping skills, fiance good understanding. 

Thanks much words. Oh promise I’m hiding behind anything. Aside fact opinions context literally impossible right wrong, many people probably prefer politicians dont prioritize stroking ego CNN making logical policy decisions. 

Don’t worry, still say I’m wrong, won’t lose sleep it. Bad news: UK govt floated idea restrictions NEXT WINTER today  I'd argue yes. make mass generic medications US done significantly cheaper - producer consumer - done China? downside Chinese government involvement everything. Amen mate. Best luck! depends long drags on. point, it'll turned people make choice.

Most millennials probably choose stay home wait vaccine. It’s not.

Hence people acting like ship option there’s unmitigated coast coast pandemic. People believe hospitals collapsed people en masse dying streets waiting get (and there's gruesome video it). friend high school pretty much expressed opinion kind scene happening everything overreactionary. math seems lacking covid 19 reporting.

How ironic claim basic math lacking percentages 100. 500,000 deaths 320 million 0.15%. 1.8 million deaths 7.8 billion people 0.023%.  Get ready yearly Covid vaccines. here. senior year passing miss whole high school environment like crazy. Really hope least month two *somewhat* relaxed restrictions.

By Hoang Thuy - Viet Tuan
Tue 1/5/2021, 08:18 pm (GMT+7)

The Vietnamese PM banned flights countries territories like U.K. South Africa recorded mutations new coronavirus.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Tuesday Ministries Foreign Affairs, Health Transport coordinate draw list countries territories new regulation apply to.

For now, list includes U.K. South Africa, two different variants virus found. one found U.K. early last month said 70 percent transmissible old one. Britain’s health minister said Monday mutation found recently South Africa even problematic.

PM Phuc issued order health ministry proposed Monday inbound flights suspended limited countries territories new, contagious coronavirus strains.

The proposal submitted ministry confirmed Saturday 44-year-old Vietnamese woman returning home Britain quarantined Mekong Delta province Tra Vinh upon arrival was infected new virus strain.

Over 40 countries territories Europe, Asia, South America, Caribbean Middle East restricted travel U.K. and, cases, travel countries documented cases virus variant.
The PM’s statement noted pandemic developing complicated ways. virus spreading quickly around 600,000 new infections 6,000 deaths recorded day, said.

The U.K. variant found 38 countries far.

Since Vietnam suspended inbound international flights late March, government organized around 260 repatriation flights bring Vietnamese citizens back 59 countries territories, according Ministry Foreign Affairs.

In addition repatriation flights, special flights carrying foreign experts investors also allowed fly Vietnam.

Vietnam, population 96 million, recorded 1,504 Covid-19 infections 35 deaths date.""

The English translation isnt clear uses wrong tense, original Vietnamese announcement, Ministry Health states suspend flights, including repatriation flights business flights allowed till now, ""epidemic regions new strains"". epidemic regions new strains generally defined new strains found widespread among community, include UK South Africa now.

Edit: tons op-ed articles assuming way asked confirmation native speaker ja​p good healthcare system indication things go expect even option getting vaccinated least 3 4 years now. read it? can’t ask can’t get it. technically correct, it’s basically impossible enforce mandate. certainly true, absolutely people office came despite company giving 2 extra weeks paid sick leave, many times takes, people contact covid+ person, well WFH option (majority us WFH). We've still multiple people decline WFH, come office wife/roommate/sibling known covid positive, letting slip idle convo people in-office. What? dead!? Again, read, wrong. I'm responding anymore. Florida included they're hiding case numbers. Probably Texas well. There's posit would successful lockdown either, people seem willing believe bizarre reason. politicians greedy sociopaths. can’t see end system happening anytime soon. Good luck brother happy new year. That's fucked fuck people 17-24 get stimulus like hello we're affected too?? stupid I'm literally college kid trying survive like everyone else live home guess I'm affected corona deserve it? get first one probably get second one either fuck US government sucks really know reporting lag. states report week. point, might well use rolling 7 day average vaccinations well infections- individual days tell us much all. boggles mind people want lowest cost producer everything, act surprised lowest cost producers end producing everything.  can’t read sentences like first one without seeing ragnarok Thor anymore 5/10%? fumigating room/area useful?  good points. Thanks, actually reference super obscure graphic novel name. comics, I'd definitely recommend giving read! stop pretending ja​p really don’t think general public quite understands variant becomes dominant US. Especially since we’re going stay wide open, likely. good points. lake unfortunate name since it’s causing much death.  currents something? Wasnt Army Iraq Afghanistan protect civilians Taliban/ISIS whatever terrorist groups wreaking havoc days. Thought whole reason US army hasnt left areas groups would come terrorize civilians did? I'm aware those, agree possibility, however distant. money make lot things happen. something big that, requiring many people loop, would almost impossible keep quiet. all. china bad I. 9 hours later sore arm mild headache that’s far.

Seems dumb way. guess, given Sweden actually that, posit theory true.  Ok. good day I'm group 1a able schedule vaccine. emails I've gotten, sounds like counties got much got enough vaccines. email got today said enough vaccines particular category (again, phase 1a - high risk essential worker) fill survey could properly assess demand. Even bigger problem B117 dominant strain B117 final dominant strain, mutation creates another strain transmissible lethal. right issue with.

And older person know died ""COVID"" count, old probably flu.

Nevermind weird *everyone* knows elderly person died year. hoax. It'll go away...

~~after election~~

~~after election decided~~

~~after election certified~~

~~after new year~~

after Biden sworn idea you’re talking about. thought might worth discussing NYC lockdown don’t time waste. Sorry. thought might find Australia's demands investigation are, part, blamed deterioration Australia-China relationship, China cutting billions dollars worth trade retaliation. 

Above OP article, another site (linked comments u/IanMazgelis) Views China grown negative recent years across many advanced economies, unfavorable opinion soared past year, new **14-country Pew Research Center survey** shows. Today, majority surveyed countries unfavorable opinion China. Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United States, South Korea, Spain Canada, negative views reached highest points since Center began polling topic decade ago.  views China increased Australia, 81% say see country unfavorably, 24 percentage points since last year.** UK, around three-quarters see country negative light – 19 points. And, [in negative views China increased nearly 20 percentage points since President Donald Trump took office, rising 13 points since last wear mask win war perhaps learn treat planet respect.

Funny people still believe masks solution. much focus masks may well problem, distracts effective meassures. “the right people”

I'm gonna go limb say probably right.  point Sweden could done containment management way Taiwan did, lockdown needed. Plenty lockdown EU countries hardly utilized data-driven mitigation measures all, look France UK. 2,9Million last 7 days Funny context compare Finland largest excess mortality continental Nordics.

From 1st Jan 20th Dec Sweden 6.5% 2015-2019 average 2nd largest deviation 2019 -2.5%. thing going illinois.2 big hospitals kmow less 50 percent take it.   Yes, agree. I've read several articles give herd-immunity number, regardless is, heartless way achieve immunity. completely unnecessary way. Yeah, I've pleasantly surprised well we've bringing cases since Tier 3 restrictions began November. expecting return full stay-at-home, I'm glad wrong. need everyone inoculated ASAP. biggest issue hospitals waiting state guidance vaccinate next. whole coordinated effort get vaccinated working. individual hospital make decision general guidelines like: 

Healthcare first, elderly, frontline, general population. idea hold guidance. need vaccinate many absence ability properly prioritize - month we've shown can't unless convenient population inoculate - people already working health care. helps feels like thought soldiers american government has. Noone said that. article age well.

I mean fully agree leukemia patients able chemo tragedy. However remember sub saw multiple posts someone needed chemo get lockdown hospital capacity. None stories reported way human right group tried frame story China.

Make wonder groups awareness double standard, otherwise can't explain choose publish article looks easy see through. gonna keep forever rate US at.. hope ramp get there. wife go back in-person teaching yesterday. already one positive case another building waiting one Para's get tested Friday see it. foolish go back early Governor election win put decision districts would avoid blame. fucking horrible. leaders going keep letting people die? 

What happens situation happens another 3 cities? 

Another 10? 

Another 50? 

How much death enough realize something drastic must done save many, many lives?

This, friends, sustainable whatsoever.

Something change. Fast. Things changing rapid pace saw three weeks ago apparently what's happening everywhere else seems different places different policies procedures. mother feeling sick days. Fatigued, headache, nausea, difficulty breathing, muscle ache. well could cold, refusing get tested. wrong asking tested? overreacting? Number 12 per million people last week. go swimming lake it’s issue women getting dismissed instead helped happen men? women get significantly testing assistance? get why.

In one large metro, fully 25% vaccines given given people ages 20 29.

Those people risk, vaccine proven stop making others sick city month past peak hospitalization.

So jeopardizing lives 85 year olds making wait vaccine? makes sense. Iraq Afghanistan wars? voicing concerns articulated first released information, pattern mutations give us concern,” Lessells said Tuesday.

Look baseless claims made scientist who’s trying study virus. Covid keyhole, 7/11 street, Uncle Roger's station wagon, name So....

Group 5% mortality rate gets 3 chances catch day.

Group B 2% mortality rate gets 300 chances catch day.

Who gets vaccine first? love morality problems! 80% heart disease preventable... government hasn’t gone extremes far deadlier disease. There’s literally restaurant called “the heart attack grill” serve food leads them. Half measures? could possibly harsh this, please share thoughts? Price Right read information? article seems disprove said. also would seem even implemented lockdowns, certainly recommending much things every country implementing. frankly, care China really trying hide something president downplayed graveness denied contracted himself.

why mad course did. 

The rest us including many non medical people working whole time. Including daycare workers. way teachers behaved ridiculous. best friend teacher things tells fellow teachers going taking vacations crying schools isn’t safe. hand. Kids really suffering data doesn’t point schools unsafe. low risk compared many jobs. Burn masks? Well better throwing ocean. still, insane. FUCKING IDIOTS!!! dare people want things liked 2020! /s I'm obligated stay awake want to. Sorry difficulty it.

My evidence primarily eyes. look more, can't find besides read hear news. easily taken context reporter fluent statistical language.

What I'd like see counts people entering buildings like stores offices, without masks. That's pretty hard refute. one main problems individualism. People care others western world failing miserably contain epidemic isn’t true. I’ve saving comment reinfection deniers:

She’s fever free week, today it’s spiked 102 degrees. really wants come see her, immunocompromised. still contagious? could possibly know without looking issues. they've handled situation antagonistic infuriating way becomes easy understand many people sincerely think hiding something.

The US openly accusing Chinese created virus lab. US also openly celebrated covid outbreak China would create American jobs. US continued blame China multiple occasions public statements. would imagine America's actions made China act antagonistic infuriating way. think? don’t. I’ll look  Oh please. Don’t compare disaster NYC 2018 flu season. Covid patients tend much sicker require care longer flu patients. article describes tents way help people milder flu symptoms “just need Tamiflu”. 

Also according CDC especially bad flu season resulted estimated 810,000 hospitalizations throughout 6 month period, currently 130,000 people hospitalized Covid restrictions. Without restrictions would flu season right top far worse Covid numbers hospital systems country would unable perform basic care. Makes sense - Czech testing numbers quite respectable, even bit Germany's lately. Poland ....... much. expecting different result. result like got summer 2020 would absolutely ideal, cases deaths dropped dramatically time vaccine cases unlikely rebound. Boring answer. Money.  I'm confused. hating China more? large majority people outraged either know anyone covid know someone recovered fine. worst thing pandemic restrictions. irrationally pisses people think wanting go back normal legitimate reason want vaccine. say irrationally know it’s literally Reddit someone would say that, still pisses off. U.S. could elect competent individuals would put us predicament don’t. Thanks Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico Iran underestimate less half. Spain joking either EKG/cardiac technician :) save NYC? death rate one highest world.

But near worst case scenario lockdown. crime drinking malt without paying 25 cents Thank you! realised miss read 'Tuesday Friday', 'Tuesday Friday'. I’m holding anything American all, arguments here. making point different ( Ireland ). America every single advertisement always mention every side effect possible, mainly big one - may cause death. remember clear day counter cough medicine drinking time haha. I’m guessing lawsuits. Whereas there’s little talk all. Everyone little hesitant take vaccine- even - will. get it’s extra scary Americans companies ( state ) don’t want millions law suits really make clear may safe, reality look statistics trial runs ( vaccines combined, they’re essentially ), gone many trials normal flu vaccine. 
I think mandatory people deal vulnerable- nurses, doctors, police etc. setting example. still rare

Reinfection common. Difficulty fighting subsequent infections rare. 

A person may infected common cold virus dozens times show symptoms first time. Hence term ""snot nosed kids"". Yes, absurd say New Zealand done better USA. simply can't compare them. Well one week may enough time 100% it. 

But indications overwhelming majority people develop good level immunity infection indication thus far different variants virus able escape immunity. Government needs make mask wearing illegal, Americans like,’ Hell no, gonna tell can’t do’
All sudden, everyone wearing masks

It’s surreal. county allows 6 month questions asked postponement, took. slight problem automated phone system (it's done web site, phone), spoke clerk confirm postponement, specifically cited COVID reason though required, largely ludicrous we're in-person jury trials.

I pro-science part country. need wear mask open door USPS mail carriers, give funny looks hand package arms length, set front doorstep. think might agreeing me. I'm referring fact relief comes spring, going late spring/early summer, experts predicting, going measurable reduction severity pandemic combined group people trouble letting go mentally prepared problem pretty much solved, try leverage extra-cautious ""out abundance caution"" stance experts abnormally low risk tolerance continued masks distancing. seems like late spring deaths hospitalizations lower, kept permanently low vaccines, risk assessment kick allow us move away precautions justified even (but all!) experts start getting skittish it.

In words, relax mask requirements go mostly back normal, maybe way, *before* herd immunity, vaccination priority groups herd immunity. work home, poor people deliver food you, putting risk enjoy ivory tower.

Get reality check Heavy *aspiration*, light optimism. real problem many protesters died OUTSIDE square instead inside? 300 people executed instead thousand? Please, discussing scale fatalities exactly happened. discussing country COMPLETELY CENSORS happened day still refuses acknowledge people executed afterwards whole event ever occuring. Yes, race war fire country! comparing athletes? Sounds like honest man Another year think I'd rather die live bleak limbo. pics taken. 8 yrs. ago. 😣 Lmao dude. Big difference weight body fat percentage. Plus athletes died heard college lineman. really optimism.

We roughly half million day right now. many week ago?

This time next week could well million day supply limited (which allegedly feds 20M ready sent states 2nd doses, that's true supply limited) Honestly I'd rather trump, least guys getting vaccinated. government procrastinated (yes procrastinated!) vaccination plan neither vaccines needles. God forbid thinking setting date vaccination actually begin. course useful, panacea, one thing is. viruses, influenza comes mind, live quite well surfaces covid extent, Anything slow transmission good seems airborne aspect far important factor. 

A layered defense always best, auto insurance, also hopefully thiings protect investment. horrible country let idiocy voice. feel like bunch people drive worse usual city, maybe something Covid. I’m shocked much shit brain hold. aren’t roughs round edges, fucking awesome: taken regimen designed taken in. 90%+ effectiveness perfectly fine, basically 50% good lot. Doesn’t mean isn’t worth it, could sole consequences. real issue people dying mainly refusing follow mitigation efforts. vaccine would help lot people aren’t following mitigation efforts ones worry 50% immunity thinking they’re Superman. 80,000 pharmacies US. 20,000 averaging 50 shots day one million doses per day.

Let’s say went plan start. distribute available vaccine doses every pharmacy America don’t worry prioritization. 

The day vaccine approved, front page every newspaper reads “Every local pharmacy 250 doses Covid vaccine give out. First come first serve.” think would less shit show what’s going now?

Sure, you’d get fast. there’d also riots. pharmacies aren’t anywhere near prepared hand shots day long, let alone middle brawls gets shot wait couple months.  Good god article 25 yr old kid, YO MOMMA. 'on-deck' circle sign people miss appointment. end day dispense people waiting line people show up. That's one deadly escalation way sort temporary herd immunity. Best luck London southeast particular, coming two three weeks worst yet.  used come home night job say me, ‘I don’t understand mom, don’t people wear masks,’"" Diana recalled. ""‘Do care people?’""

Americans give damn anyone themselves. mother bury son. survives covid19 son doesn't. 

Usa!! Usa!! Usa!!

/s Scientists past 7 months: COVID spreads air via droplets

Business/Government/Schools: deep clean surfaces every night bottle hand sanitizer entrance

This response understandable March April - it’s clear it’s security theatre. Masks, distance, ventilation/air flow matters. Distance ventilation isn’t talked it’s expensive even though it’s effective. Hey really hope you’re right. I’ve feeling really hopeless next year living way. situation could 1000x worse it’s pretty defeating right thing year read we’re even close end. go gym wear mask everywhere end year I’ll happy. Sounds like good plan. states probably adopt similar protocols.... Okay short rant:

My grandma 86 we’ve already multiple Covid scares there’s mass-vaccination event seniors county week refuses vaccinated primary care doctor is. 

This news people. makes people hesitant take vaccine purposely play fucking devil’s advocate vaccine asking it’s safe scientific consensus it’s fucking safe. They’re incredibly dishonest blow every single story adverse reaction someone infected getting whether it’s effective it’s severing public trust. don’t want sound like you-know-who, media handling dishonestly dare say—fake? 

STOP FUCKING PLAYING DEVIL’S ADVOCATE VACCINES GET VIEWERS CLICKS. LOOKING MEDIA! 15% first... wait 21 days doses think new extra contagious variant, supplement unemployment running out, lack leadership federal level including lack funding Newsom bad job sudden? already posted believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus). Please include link submission.* basically trial judged solely people believe Covid hoax pandemic made up? guess could work favour claim evidence also made hoax. fucking know that. Kyle Lowry plays NBA much thinner kid. many huge NFL linemen died? They're obese kid. GTFOH bullshit. Wear mask  flu mutates much faster COVID. get flu year two getting different strain.

This change flu vaccine every year new strains come out.

What I'm talking reinfections strain short period.of time. rare happen. would analogous reinfections COVID. Keep borders tight. don’t want we’ve got. Oh hate Texas. tried sue state election. Fuck Texas! talking effectiveness, may right. requires ignoring fatalities. maybe trust anonymous photos find posts article video supporting viewpoint basically China supports said first wont last. I'll wait year. then, many different brands vaccine available much larger group study. dont think unreasonable unexpected people hesitant it. think unreasonable people though. 

Only one person close group Pfizer one pretty rough side effects days. did. Forgot movie.  like bash nurses. plenty smart RNs got licenses BSN required...but agree, scientifically literate average Facebook troll. One Ban Reddit I’m gonna Ban Reddit phone! nothing kids following rules either. [archive.is getting hazard pay? blame type thing probably result total collapse public education system continues much longer. Maybe best system seems failing lot people. need make shit everyone world conspiracy theorist, plainly evident fact.

I think would dandy people adopted ""conspiracy fantasist"" could better distinguish investigative journalists tinfoil hat flat earthers.

But they're thing world, fine. Enjoy delusional world view. Texas justice finest. remember people downplaying troop deaths many soldiers died Vietnam simultaneously counting death tragedy let justify staying wars.

The Vietnam War saw approximately 50k American deaths. course entire decade long campaign. enough people die COVID eclipse number every 1-2 months.

Yes, read right. entire Vietnam War's death total every two months. Excellent choice vaccines vaccination strategy Emirati leadership (the goes Bahrain). ridiculous. Coronavirus lock downs much bigger threat humanity coronavirus due risk destroying economy unleashing unforeseen title wave 

Crazy countries harshest lockdowns economies recover guess could argue coronavirus could cause us lose ""humanity"" becoming selfish barbarians, refuse work together, try steal election, hoard vaccines, try use tragedy personal gain, etc.

You mean like certain party person power trying achieve right now? There's limit long people tolerate lockdowns. Regardless mutations appear. issue low compared modern vaccines.

you remember, COVID fastest turn-around time develop test vaccine 4 years. surprise vaccines, put together basically one year, might little ""rough around edges"" think minute local government come play here. State governments much power handling Covid, ridiculous. Trump blame specifically. Pritzker Lightfoot could intervene here, that. easy target 80,000 pharmacies US. 

20,000 50 day one million right there. Roughly 10,000 urgent cares, 2500 50 day another 125k. 

This even include hospitals mass vaccination efforts. That’s unfortunately many Education Secretaries around world pushing for

Can't revitalize economy without ~~free daycare~~ public education working parents need stay home thought process, guess. 🙄 Even American, vet makes think veterinarians first. Veteran isn’t long word, would lot clearer newspapers used instead vet. looks little overweight fucking 25. GTFOH. Wear mask. people willing pay good money take people need take gotta get paid take it?!?! Ok, well wish good health I’m hoping stay safe :)  evidence masks effective worn properly? downvoted opinion?

P.S. agree points staying home, working home social distancing, masks used properly effective hence surgeons use operating you! Flu reinfections norm, talking about? people flu many times. website App setup Federal Government peoples phones press release Pfizer, released prior publication phase III trial results New England Journal Medicine, states vaccine ""demonstrated 95% efficacy preventing COVID-19 without prior infection 7 days second dose."" Interpret would like to.  Trump lost election, there's need cover pandemic anymore. Pick me! PICK ME! I'll it! ""Those said weren’t comfortable court pandemic dismissed.""

And realize room coronavirus. Tough luck. Public-health records show outbreaks 500 businesses. 9,300 workers infected. Among them: 


* 402 **FedEx** workers eight sites - 128 cases documented Pacoima facility alone.
* Seven **Costco** stores hit outbreaks - 253 workers infected, including 71 Culver City location.
* 210 **Amazon** employees infected six different facilities. Trump ordered teachers Chicago return? Pritzker, Lightfoot, teachers' unions, others say? far Biontech Moderna took two months get conditional marketing approval. reason assume J&amp;J different. Results February, approval April. wonder many people hate Texas.  Uh know maybe CORONAVIRUS. No, everybody ability stay home. Many people *have* go work earn money, go grocery store essential errands like visiting doctor. Even not, may live someone does. people 60 US live taken care younger person go work.

Are really aware this? live ultra-rich bubble people need work buy groceries? understand people like you. point ignorance willful. guy it’s stupid totally work home  Someone twitter said UK government telling people avoid conception right getting vaccine.  obviously idea true.  dont want another kid long safe im good kids lol meant critical thinking skills etc. I’m worried reason I’m worried get flu shot tetanus booster. FDA strict I’m worried one million adverse reaction, I’ll happy get vaccine even hit epi pen. I’m fucking ready pandemic over. really not. know many people working construction still travel across country work week, stay b&amp;b hotel come home weekend. 

They furloughed first lockdown J&amp;J surely quicker April. see can't turn approval around month interim results due month. ""whatabout, whatabout, whatabout???""  anything vaccination symbolic ""how bad get?"" also long get herd immunity. Super transmissible mumps requires 90%+ vaccination rate. 

If covid gets Rt boost 2.5 3.2, may take herd immunity 60% 70%. also vaccine resistant, that's another boost top. 

For US 10% boost would require extra 33M vaccinations, that's extra month lost even 1 Million vaccinations per day. Yeah, least covid didn’t *willingly* send people get killed. 

Wait minute... Where’s data back big boy? What’s conspiracy theory they’re pushing masks hard? Cuz stock mask making companies? like global warming, don’t believe it? Ok you’re dumb what, doesn’t want cleaner earth? don’t believe don’t wear one cuz think makes look cool shit? Dept public health/cops/national guard take pics VIN’s plates.

Put warnings tickets windshields. pay ticket renew plates something next year.

I mean fire dept gets fine ass don’t fire extinguishers emergency exits light up.

Yeah, don’t know great solution, hopefully half-ass measures good enough vaccine rollout fast enough get without another 300k deaths. Sadly, doubt we’ll get done million deaths. second masks mandatory shops etc country people went shopping. like ""now finally safe, let's go together"". keep reminding everyone COVID-19 came China. race time countries declared war time measure force industry help manufacture vaccine manufacture it?

Manufacturing problem. Distribution problem. We're trying roll vaccine simultaneously trying keep pandemic control treating sick. medical personnel would normally distributing vaccine either helping take care already sick patients coming sick themselves.

Then add anti-vaxxers political bullshit this, slowing efforts rolling vaccine. pandemic fatigue, politics mask wearing, realities trying keep economy propped contributing furthering spread exponential rate. 

Plus, even know long vaccine works. vaccine's effectiveness lasts (for example) four months takes six months achieve herd immunity vaccination (and that's optimistic estimate), worry adjusting vaccine every mutation getting tested, approved distributed forever chasing tails. 

I know lot people want admit it, think COVID stay, think time come start figuring going make long-term changes society economy cope it. Dog, problem isnt production vaccines, states worrying criteria getting vaccine out. reason shouldnt go age. think data strains variants like this. strain sequenced done widely. recently discovered strains. common tests identify strain. info this.

One group scientists said UK strain contagious binds human cells differently even pretty late breaking news verified. Also doesn’t account testing rates. teachers 10x likely tested cases would caught? going start eating rich? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Wjat airplane pilots cockpit? countless jobs can't work remotely, can't physically distance others? Isn’t California Democratic utopia though? Hmmm....it’s almost leaders sides don’t give shit incompetent . . . why? 

You say different, also know. much reason there. What's why? think tell wear kind face underlying chronic lung disease, COPD asthma, able wear non-N95 facial covering without affecting oxygen carbon dioxide levels,"" Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer American Lung Association, told ABC News, adding ""masks detrimental effects, even patients chronic lung disease.""

When asked people difficulty breathing face mask exempt, stated: ""There many different facial covers even shields could worn instead, one cannot tolerate conventional face mask.""

Rizzo said ""cases exemption far between,"" ""people supplemental oxygen compromised respiratory status become short breath even walking might meet criteria, case, going public health risk person."" _expired_ doses? Source, please. Stuck freezers, yes, expired, find incredibly unlikely. Yeah that’s first thing ends eases up. Preventing long term (or even short term) disability pretty compelling reason tie re-opening declining spread rather declining mortality imo.

A 30 year old might die catch it, wrecking lungs rest life good reason try best prevent happening blame placed belongs. that’s adults do. narcissistic man babies who’ve never taken responsibility anything lives sycophantic followers. Hence slow rollout. Drive demand, skim supplies. deregulated capitalism great... looking like like two urban areas roughly population, believe fair approximation. comparing New York City South Bend Indiana, accurate. would serve better spend time attempting grasp complexity things assume everything con others trying get fall for.

OK, calculations? blindly believe Kool Aid think flavor accurate? ends people decide end. doctor politician actual say it. people enough, vaccines not, life move on, roll dice carry on.

I know right that's going be... already many places. true general, maybe may hallmark current state socio-political decay polarization, country survived Spanish Flu wartime. tell pandemic hit us 30 years ago....when GHWB President, think would seen mass compliance masks social distancing needed beat back virus. What's going California, like state even close level. Even Florida restrictions near level ??

Did even look SARS been? list country: Pacific Islands largely locked extremely vulnerable. New Zealand funding vaccinations many them. Ah yes, Florida. Suppose post-Christmas impact applying now. already bombarded healthcare system right are. Grow up. administration fucked since jump. state bear responsibility, federal response beyond incompetent. won’t change without revolution. capitalist society reforms make rolled back public pressure waned. may take decades eventually we’d back now. suspect classic case bad apples making headlines good apples remaining unknown. guess ""80-90% health care workers nationwide embrace vaccine"" make click-worthy headline. would love see actual numbers this. gotta tanks put oxygen in, dumbass. high risk essential workers forced go work. /s worry, States already moving ahead protect 'Religious"" (tm) people

.

can't ""patriots"" (tm) discriminated against. /s  One thing appreciative govt instruct pple use mask despite obvious shortage. Instead plenty AD educate public right way put mask. also plenty program debunk myths sterilzing used mask rice cooker alcohol. 

I guess Taiwan really learnt SARS. Also thanks asshole reminded us alone. lift finger help Taiwan even global pandemic needs upvotes gets buried again. horrific shit people need hear it. Walk like Egyptian /s known beginning.

It’s ridiculous think point still relying one report Wuhan. 

We information now. information includes evidence outdoor spread certain rate. I'm waiting people start saying need stay home every winter help slow spread flu. least doubt vaccine safe Trump really causing surely democrats fix right?? get dry throat dry cold weather MA, dry throat anxiety. think dry throat, dryer throat gets, anxious get throat dry, cycle continues. fun. anyway try allergy medication humidifier room, course keep safe *you* make claim *you* substantiate me! saying data far limited make claim. 

We know however exposure time important. someone breathing particles breathing near them, risk breathing particles. longer near likely inhaled particles. hallway near someone short time may less risky classroom away much longer time. not. actually know cloud slows sufficiently, ventilation, specific patterns airflow, type activity become important. Viral load emitter, duration exposure, susceptibility individual infection also clarity Median age Tanzania 18 years. probably better fatality wise western pretty much % HCWs get flu vaccine either. large majority _are_ getting that's enough convince hesitant there's much do. non-residents, states ?

or one ever visit Nebraska ? AstraZeneca see approval April earliest. There's 0 chance Germany undermine ""European solidarity"" approach. Well manager bets managers getting covid dont give proper safety equipement ?

 Lawyer !! interpreted statement differently guess. saw fines hospitals entities don’t use quickly efficiently. 

I guess missed part penalties people aren’t priority groups, I’ll go reread it. Thanks. lot various vaccine shots, can't imagine it'd bad – feel very, very, similar. got several one day, too. difference. live schools fully remote job fully remote probably end summer, it’s perfectly possible. absolutely agree learning even quite different places, EU/US probably start thinking legislation would allow border closures countries/states would include mandatory quarantine facilities returning residents - big distinguishing feature countries keeping cases almost 0.

I'm Finland really know we've done well compared Europe, many senses we're almost like island - Russian border already strictly controlled easy close/limit crossings, areas near Northern borders sparsely populated, rest actual water.

Even then, Finnish experience shows trivial limit travel: Haparanda (Sweden) Tornio (Finland) one city, economical everyday life purposes. hospitals Haparanda area like 50% staff commute Finland.. Sweden's epidemic starts? Tell nurses can't come work? Tell nurses go work, they're allowed back home?

Lots country/state borders like this. Probably there's way close them, easy all.  federal government told okay shut okay employ undocumented it’s okay bend rules don’t like. people need eat. Geesh Agreed. Florida giving anyone 65 up. Surely could found younger donor? Whatever. People getting vaccinated. That's major reason teachers' welfare prioritized pandemic. Let's even mention risks exposed poses students. Yes, Tanzania, country closed lab conducting RT-PCR testing President Tanzania falsely claimed goats blood papaya tested positive. recall Covid-19 sceptics using Tanzania ""proof"" RT-PCR tests work. Look tall poppy syndrome, phenomenon deeply culturally engrained NZ. believe refers ""Ivy League"" (which absolutely relevance NZ) ""educator"" he's getting downvoted lol. Oh thought stock market economy /s amount people post justifying garbage reason rich people always shit head, laugh faces, invest body-bags pandemic, actively kill us get away it, idiots non-idiots always try whiteknight behaviours find reasoning behind dream idea rich = good. Idols.

""oh donated fine"". FUCKING NOT. donation mean hop line, BRIBED. THAT'S DID. FUCKING DONATION. exactly like parents ""donating"" money UNIs stupid sons get accepted.

""oh maybe accelerates process"". tells that? way case frontline workers side sanitary workers still get shot. them. know Nurse/physician stop work result positive, right? (except emergency cases). fking die likely replacement? accelerating process, ones vaccinating people? best change speed.

i'm even American thanks god. fk yep, little noise outside ambulances church bells 10 blocks away. quite experience... still investigating China coronavirus origins new know found earlier Italy meaning China origin ?

&amp;#x200B;

Did miss something ? Even Reddit, people denied it. one believed would really affect healthcare.

Now people waiting hours ambulance, regardless need for. money / insurance private hospital right now, screwed. Curbside available many different places. Place order online, drive walk up, they'll bring you. free places, say baggers take tips they've accepted ones I've left trunk them. wondering Dr. Dre made ICU last night given COVID situation SoCal.   studies early broke illness virus 6 symptoms range mild severe certain symptoms abdominal pain appear one category.

There probably 7th category asymptomatic, studied much probably obvious reasons. would find population people test positive symptoms study them. thought interesting understand think better idea virus does.

It entirely possible viruses generate asymptomatic response people never studied never big deal. flu deadly years within tolerable levels apparently.

I agree Fauci really bundling communication. early comments really age well, late late February basically saying little risk. subsequent comments clearly designed illicit cautious response public rather actually informing them. admitted recent interview, said telling people thought ready hear. allegations moving goalposts terms immunity lockdowns spot opinion. lost losing credibility parts public bad need someone communicating. want make political normal government, Fauci would top advisor leader would turning input good message public hear informative gives actionable guidance. OP he's probably referring [Cuomo's recent 
Basically ParCare clinic obtained vaccine doses started distributing persons State's priority list.
 
Cuomo calls fraud seek sign EO would fine actions $1MM. happen April earliest. EMA find present data convincing wait results US study. Oh, see. countries like USA face significant red tape bureaucracy. decisive leadership top coordinate response everybody running around like headless chickens.

This pass even basic scrutiny.

Hospitals handed doses vaccine, guidance prioritize, online access report usage. Plus tons handy online guides CDC.

Surely hospitals need federal government oversee process opening freezer, pulling vials out, putting needles arms? Ask proof non existent quote agree more. Quelle surprise talking MMR vaccine, you. No, one leaders union. Australia good. couple states. pretty much living normal lives WA since June fatality rate fortunately low beginning see longer term effects disease. scariest increase seen people throwing clots. mRNA studied decades like anything new unknowns. 

It personal choice me, based research studied doctors talked made easy one me. absolutely case. federal government already holding back second dose. states free distribute 100% vaccine worry second dose already reserved federal storage. 

The states well would mean using 25% vaccine supply. Australia China two biggest, we're pretty well reason United States first world democracy Presidential system government. poor system large, diverse electorate usually collapse authoritarian regimes. lasted long fifty years ago electorate mattered voice government narrow, wealthy white business owners. rest population striving representation system collapsing. US needs adopt parliamentary system going survive all. built don’t staff delicious put pie. Like crust, whipped peanut butter, boom that's it. kinda headline makes say told needed list people refusing wear masks social distance. (and many, many people, I'm sure) would definitely prefer factor situation get saying then.

Well Im open data coronaspread classrooms coronaspread hallways.

To logic sound, science says direct contact infected person inhaling droplets. cant get direct packed hallway hey maybe ventilation classrooms better thought. 

It claim willing make, proof otherwise Im ears. possible they’re island less commercial air traffic US among countries possibility low number initial infections? 

Not talking response, want know possible confounding factors. think given saying two weeks. see above. Now, 3 months stated next winter. 

Society get back normal people make priority likely march streets get it. Requires previous higher mark startpoint. already pretty dang low made problem needed Capable? mean I'm capable winning lotto, statistically speaking, well, still quit day job 😉. basically live southern california GTFO...you so. Lol guys Trump's fault, live Canada shit show too.

The government sucks plain simple, led morons long something drastic happening....we fucked cause leaders literal monkeys

We first world richbass countries government could organize 11 months.

I'm trying defend Trump I'm saying incompetent government issue. one welcome upcoming New Zealand Empire They're going commit crime anyway, make crime legal. shit fuaci. people think control? much arrogance species don’t even understand damn brain completely. It’s obvious. can’t say pandemic. also lot civil unrest Law Enforcement African American community last year. ""Systematic racism POC"", something.

God America awful POC! delete facebook honestly. Cuomo reality TV star, say nurses ones stealing PPE! U.S. many layers government, many politicians blame federal level everything. remove state local levels federal government always responsible level?  Cases rising hotspots growing. lockdown bit things could go quickly easily everyone complacent . Tell Americans - I'm one them, live there. Well extent lock Spain. Stay house, go supermarket week - checked. Yeah disappointing remember potentially three vaccines way. numbers Hogan cited based current rate federal allocation doses. J&amp;J likely gonna approved February give US 100m doses, effectively increasing supply 50% taking one shot easier administer. AZ approved April knows much faster could move, US gov't bought 300m doses enough 150m people AZ vaccine cheap fast manufacture. That's even mentioning novavax would increase supply even more. We'll get this! point this? Knowing people died somewhere else bring 3,900 people back unhealthy essential worker local population 70,000+ homeless people allowed constantly throw garbage defecate streets. moved LA October got tired seeing human feces street everyday. confirm: know hospital finance executive vaccinated yesterday. Imagine thinking Harvard degree means nothing New Zealand Fine, vaccines protection community - it’s increased risk another flu. Doesn’t mean shut everything every winter. 

Good luck trying put sad face telling people second Christmas. 50% Canadians didn’t listen time. 100% won’t listen next. I’m saying read science-based article virologist I’m likely believe article fiction novelist. Never said wasn’t true story. didn’t time read check primary sources. knock him. might correct. I’m PharmD MPH know evaluate literature like go primary journal reference whenever time. almost always google author reading check potential bias. It’s good habit, think, critical thinking. looking get pissing contest - explaining rationale. Federal guidelines would - guidelines - stop stories like this. States ultimately ones dispensing vaccine. people may eventually get it. sister's clinic, several coworkers said want wait see. think want wait see though, dose held them.  Someone gave wholesome award. Republicans keep saying children aren’t household vectors it’s safe reopen schools Ive known political bs since day one. say wash hands, wear mask, don’t touch face: kids least likely remember.

Plus, take parents. can’t forget woman mid lockdown wearing mask chin three kids wearing masks chins walking grocery store speaking loudly touching everything mid-year. Sigh.  Airline tickets seem like easiest thing for, every adult ticket assigned name purchase can’t really transfer them. 

Concerts sports seem much complicated. I’m buying 4 tickets stubhub tickets originally bought Ticketmaster? think hit 5k week two. right. correct way suppressing spread much possible (summer Europe), roll vaccine quickly.

As high numbers infected, vaccine roll slow, virus enough chances mutate select favor vaccine-resistant strains. inevitable, extend vaccine-resistance depend luck.

Unfortunately people get Covid vaccine (UK well way), end relatively resistant population result natural infection + vaccination. Together reinfections vaccine-resistant strains circulating around. Getting vials seem issue moment wonderful see country actually cares citizens. hospital also labor staff time administering vaccine?  That’s one thoughts also. mean living people spend majority paycheck essentials make economy run? literally every single study economies function effectively say that?!

/s Except one politician rules america.

You elementary student's grasp American politics. Eh, gonna get better soon. know sux right now, get worse gets better, knew coming. hang tight guys, give up. 2-3 months tops things really start looking up. came far, survive bit longer. Stay strong remember, alone! two new variants contagious, bunch kids breathe air hours day. Holy shit, idiology. think competition straightforward deaths, definitely human impact. Careers stunted extinguished, marriages children postponed, first time homebuyers stymied, loss housing economic security... instability knock effects years, decades, lifetimes come.

No one really allow compared death, consider years life lost many deaths likely they're far off. It’s dis’ French. would still cool statistcis many healthcare workers already got vaccine many want it. 

To honest 10% refusing get would bad enough. Keep mind vaccination already required traveling countries. U.S.: Except find traces virus italy restesting samples 2019 : course prevent fact China huge population density become one main initial super spreaders places virus identified first, also means investigation really virus origin, logic says sent Italy, least Europe general sense, check oldest traces known. long, robots coming. soon won’t need healthy people. 

/s unless bezos high risk? CaNt mURICa Nz DiD?!? exactly point. sad watch essential workers go many people ignoring warnings. rude arrogant everyone make essential workers going dangerous times right now. That's true. better health care 1918 flu still far deadlier. example, 1918 flu 50x death rate younger populations (10% vs 0.2%) Covid has. Think it, even 5% young adults (sub 35) Covid hospitalized require medical care sort, let alone die. 

Even hypothetical case medical care sort 1918 Influenza would still kill far people. 1918 influenza death rate (10%) higher even total Covid hospitalization rate (2.5-5%), let alone death rate. It’ll interesting see flu becomes less problem future thanks 1-2 years covid measures extra hand washing, social distancing masks. Canada Well actually interests visit. ever going carefully choreographed rubber stamping exercise validate CCP story. afterwards, CCP forever refer visit proof version events. expect anything informative come visit. Everyone known lived Texas implied way keep section idiot's sections. Rich people first, Desantis friends. rest pay vaccine limited quantities only. /s Wait why? Even originate there, put swift ending We're asking question governors throughout country. That's got there, feeling shame... sure help, son enjoyed could also try busy board, bubble/ paint play empty bathtub work nearby....?

At age, nothing keeps attention long. That's really tough. would 100% stand line chance vaccine even didn’t get it. think lot people would. New York Times: “It considered unlikely anyone actually killed Tiananmen whatever. want put head sand, that’s you. You’re one who’s lied media.  Antibody drugs target one particular part spike protein, much easier virus evade those.

The vaccine produces many different antibodies target different parts spike protein. much difficult virus evade vaccine. think scientists think vaccine completely ineffective virus variants (worst case slightly less effective). Trust me, side effects virus (unemployment, despair, lost socialization) going much worse actual deaths sicknesses virus.

 
When over, 500K americans died millions long term health issues, hundreds millions americans fucking ruined unintended consequences. suspect situation bad enough, government really care would bring martial law whatever else needed maintain lockdown. I'm sure administration would willing act first worry legality suited them. main thing even really seriously try contain US government seen serious threat beginning. report linked considered scientific publication since never peer reviewed... published respectable scientific journal. simply put research all... didnt make conclusion efficacy single dose regimen merely stated article efficacy 52% dose 1 dose 2. Figure 3 article. dont scientific medical training everything easy license maintain, liabilities, also researcher... realize trial designed assess efficacy single dose regimen.. maybe stick two dose schedule try take data trial designed purpose go slice dice make numbers up. Anyhow agree disagree. Poland morning reported sharp rise, 553 deaths virus, that's US equivalent 4,811 deaths cant give number 😂 

Everything else listed dependent rate infections know?

It's moving goal posts, genuine question asked - I'm sure well aware trade tests accuracies? could make argument around mask laws. national strategy one eradication virus. want travel NZ China Canada ever done virus. 😔😔 Total incompetence. Priority good idea working. need vaccinating people soon get vaccines. need set vaccination centers place. Get army involved get national guard involved. Wtf Newsom doing? damn currupt incompetent countries islands properly close borders proper hard lockdown short duration (relative half ass lengthy ""lockdowns"" aka restrict businesses) gotta break freezers every time shipment comes speed vaccinations Wow, good news, even deaths transmittable illnesses leading overall decrease death Enough data remains consistent every metric like excess death, burial crematorium reports. 

Wanna move goal posts more? true country well, March October. entered complete lockdown barely 8 cases country went really well. normal summer. population started thinking everything fine. start October happened. January top lists almost caught Italy deaths per capita.

Here's actual data:

 [COVID-19 pandemic always vigilant. early success might mean put guard down. so? That’s nuts. NY nursing home work clear, vaccines spouses government may charge facility even tried. tested yesterday! curiosity there's many progressive people others would issue ban kind stuff enough go around bad impossible pass law tests must $20 less. also can't anything else. We're completely powerless. I'm US, work ""out hospital cardiac arrest"" -patients walk home 20% cases. great, much zero. job hospital involves going hospitals multiple times per week/month, easier get vaccine. Think like grocery store. easier/quicker ring 100 items 1 person 1 item 100 people. 

The individual burden may less important, right speed is. even know believe it. healthcare worker described may see getting vaccine priority even means missing hour sleep.

Get many people vaccinated soon possible. current groups easiest administer shots to. familiar facilities, process, likely abundance people actually administer shots.  hope people remember this; Scroll new daily infections. Ah, vague promise vaccinations starting March actually based nothing??? teacher, family is. idea teachers thoughts concerns kids remote learning CRAZY!!! go far say scientists know. UK SA variants infected millions people. deadlier, would expect evidence deadlier. fact evidence pretty good indicator deadlier. 

It's often case media distorts things negative direction (since fear generates clicks). example, couple scientists said ""concerned"" vaccines might bit less effective SA variant. Certain articles distorted ""scientists say vaccines work SA variant"". despite fact real possibility vaccines completely ineffective (just slightly less effective) there's still good chance efficacy vaccines reduced all. exact symptoms dad, covid positive, get tested good close ones... like country. pace state going I'm looking forward getting vaccine October 2023. state's population 10th California. many homicides ""civil unrest Law Enforcement African American community last year""? Apparently missing since every single Western media news outlet exact title.  Keep pal stay safe cannot wrap head around scrambling find people vaccinate. really ask arbitrary amount doses?

How hard would get people wanted sign appointment even requisitioned doses? No. Even article quote says “could” restrictions next winter can’t manage today. never said still restrictions.

You need understand new even infectious version needs urgent containment hard contain even measures. lol still following mainstream media point shit. People pretend schools somehow safe fucking morons. 

If society want prioritize schools operating close ""normal"", need offsetting keeping bars/resteraunts/non essential businesses open curbside only. Thank part keep rest us safe.

I'm tired read Headmistress Dumbledore It’s crazy people think explain hundreds thousands Covid-19 deaths people coincidentally dying unrelated cause brief period infected, single case someone dying 2 days receiving vaccine would cause panic.

Like said though, it’s tragedy matter cause death found be. No, many people included number received second dose normal three-week window. secondary analysis Table 4 separate duration second dose - meta-analysis study participants across dosage regimens, matter received Dose 2.

The answer _that_ question actually Table 3, numbers seem comparable &lt;8 weeks weeks (which good news) sample sizes fairly small data sliced way, research needed.

But two doses. original post talks single idea single dose vaccine reduce chance getting infected roughly ~70% (64.1% specifically, bc y’all sticklers)

And data support claim, 64.1% number citing examining period time patients received one dose. includes protection full duration study delivery doses.

None tells us single dose's efficacy is, every study participant received two doses (even ones intended receive one study outset). limited data examining short term results period patients got second booster shot, break separately except hospitalizations.

The best strategy UK would focus fully immunizing many high risk patients possible quickly possible vaccines know work well - Pfizer Moderna - manufacturer-intended, clinical trial-tested dosages schedules. vast majority hospitalizations driven high risk portion population. focus peanut buttering broader, less-effective immunization across whole population economic benefit. rollout many parts US seems based virtue signalling support medical workers pragmatism.

With vaccine eliminates serious COVID, seems like pragmatic approach targeting rollout audiences highest risk serious COVID.

While medical workers impacted COVID, also work full PPE day day carefully controlled environment. Many people working hospitals also younger substantially lower risk serious disease.

Rollouts targeted people certain age groups seem substantially simpler administer accurately target problem we're actually trying solve here. Smart. Masks used reason. hospitals serve chicken wings claiming they're food? may need shut hospitals, too. wearing mask, like sensible people do. unfortunate. coordination absolutely abysmal. know many 65’s among relatives friends, center FL coasts. one knows go, sign up. lack communication inexcusable. saw Daytona issue parents experienced panhandle. Seeing at-risk population wait long lines cars cringeworthy. Many isolating possibly catch COVID trying get vaccine. Generally UK people wear indoors big income virus tax bracket? 'But daddy government going give us lives back!' Never, unless stop accepting shit. 

Who hell guy think shutdown society every 6 months year? Much like flu, covid 19 never fully go away deserves award. wish one give you. big things rolling distribution (it would dumb advance phase supply) 75s access end month.  buy testing, that's simply case vaccines. 2/3 vaccines sitting freezer hospital they're allowed give group 1A half healthcare workers declined vaccine.

There hospital admin day corroborated exact scenario, confirm mom (a nurse), experienced thing clinic.

(Swedish health care system decentralized, makes assembling national-wide reporting bit complicated countries). also comment reporting often change situation healthcare, strains stressing staff report often; 

Personally, liked updates daily, also spent three months repeating people delay reporting Sat-Mon also delays death reporting deaths added day deaths occurred day A, rather previous days.

  Arizona facing ‘dire circumstances,’ outbreak even worse summer’s surge.

“We everything get that,” said. “Yet lot factors don’t direct control absolutely working me.”

Will Humble, director Arizona Public Health Association, sees case trajectory Arizona clearly following deployment retrenchment state public health measures.

In mid-May, Gov. Doug Ducey, Republican, lifted stay-at-home orders, making Arizona one first states reopen widely spring Covid-19 lockdowns. mitigation measures remained place, enforcement sporadic, Mr. Humble said, number cases quickly soared. governor put place stricter orders, closing bars gyms allowing cities counties declare mask mandates, cases dropped precipitously.

Many stricter measures lifted weeks later, seemed little enforcement rules remained place, Mr. Humble said. governor announced measures aimed curbing virus early December — urged people follow recommended public health guidelines — consistently rebuffed appeals stringent restrictions, statewide mask mandate, cancellation big sports events delay return in-person schooling.

Mr. Ducey’s approach already led criticism, drew attention week, footage emerged social media governor’s son dining restaurant crowded people, none could seen wearing face coverings.

“It highlights possible Arizona,” Mr. Humble said. “It’s kid it. It’s kid could it.”

Messages sent governor’s office seeking comment returned.

In April, Francisco Sirvent, lawyer lives Chandler, city southeast Phoenix, started Facebook group called “Reopen Arizona.” almost 500 members. takes virus seriously, said, knows particularly deadly older people. believe lockdowns way handle it, calling “feel-good” measures harm good.

that’s absolutely terrible messed up. can’t swim, Clark. Part says became president lifetime secret service detail history shady deals shady company Pretty awesome development Germany.

After summer break, opened schools September becuase pressure politicians high. 

They claimed infections schools low places ""superspreading"" takes place. 

But would virus levitate around younger people? time, already knew infants/young adults rarely develop symptoms? 

It pretty obvious point rate asymptomatic carrieres / immense age stratum. those, sick obviously perfect health, individuals would spread viruses home families. 

I personally know one case kids brought home virus kindergarden. Yet tested questioned whether might corona common children families become sick quickly.

We pieces puzzle somehow people manage combine simplest picture.

Probably conclusion hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

We acted weak beginning, one hurtful lockdown could (probably) ended this. measurements need restrictive. Sorry, im tune covid news.

So heard mom say biden said would probably take years majority people get covid vaccine? true? speaking fact knows lot people trust vaccine may take awhile get people actually take it?

If latter im kind scared. least want things least go semi normal. Especially mom like mine. forces wear mask soon step outside im fine usually even nobody around even we’re car. Plus impossible anything like get job, see friends, etc. chances might making us go back school soon person seeing classmates friends already got covid dont care protecting it, im scared.

Please tell SOON one assumes everyone could infected including result could achieved. suspect care care enough test either make much difference. bad Trump's talents running businesses ground making peoples' lives worse nursing home employee learned 40% coworkers received vaccine given work CVS think assholes might help improve vaccination rates. Brits: ""are baddies now?""


China: ""Now?"" arent hiring short term contracts atm. going 12-16 weeks ending chaos see turn. Well estimate. Bravo states understand, like NY, providers could fined hundreds thousands dollars exact thing. Oof, I'm sorry. friends Texas tell bad there.

Have link: find way force close. go eat haggis miserable covid bag Mad max really gonna happen, America Wait, jury trials suspended people falsely arrested? freedom solely depend opinion judge? wouldn’t say awful, maybe cup tea. definitely trusted source healthcare information perhaps unqualified science writer. much advocate opening schools, UK variant Covid effects kids before. We’ll see that’s true guess. implies preventing 95% symptomatic cases.

I've never heard that, understanding, AFAIK never stated. Therefore implication may misinterpretation someone's part. Anyone got Cherokee language courses? Definitely Nazi death camps, don’t even worry it... Yeah... receive juror summon mail, shit going straight trash.  I'll claim receive pay related civil fine road. Vancouverite - couldn’t wrong. We’re outside year. Hiking, skiing, surfing still popular rainy weather. part actually common practice places COVID hit.

“If patient signs breathing pulse, EMS try resuscitate patient least 20 minutes, memo said.

If patient stabilized time, would taken hospital.

But patient declared dead scene pulse restored, paramedics take patient hospital.” NZ however easier control pandemic , mainly remote island low population density.  
There way seal example NYC major European cities way NZ did.  


For Example i'm sure Iceland Greenland (a bit exaggerated examples) also excelant. hope student loan paid cause takin rich folk anyone else Maybe professor could please explain? vaccines work please nuke get with?  government saying four people died, probably like 3-5 times amount, depending size ward. Yes little before. It’s different countries continent islands. 

You see move accross U.K. county clearly, away port September. could probably track back came inclined, doesn’t really matter came anything, find saying came port U.K. bad reasoning. would super unlucky created town largest U.K. port.  Right, made distinction individual measures. everyone followed moderate measures, easily control spread. everyone followed strict measures weeks, probably root entirely. control individual even majority limited long large minority acting irresponsibly. one vacation Caribbean recently?

HELLO ‘Merica Yes  say variant 50% effective transmission say around many months. case assume countries. Yes. correct. approved two rapid tests. One needs $40/$50 machine prescription believe colored lines costs $25 -$30. 

Michael Mina talking rapid saliva tests cost $19.99 box 30 tests. 
I like cheap enough people purchase use frequently. 
Let’s say essential worker grocery store...he / test everyday. small business restaurant owner test entire staff. positive go home , negative stay work. 

I imagine holdup reporting collecting data well privacy issues. 

I follow Michael Mina twitter really sold idea rapid tests way control virus. always thought attenuated live virus crippled? seems dead virus? Zhang Zhan arrested regards two claims made regarding early Wuhan lockdown. First people pay COVID tests secondly people stuck homes sent rotten vegetables. Chinese gov says lies maintains true. claims true arrested cover embarrassing story still hardly anything larger COVID response nothing genesis virus. Yes it’s odd. roommate traveling nurse moved NY CA March, jobless. didn’t get job December. However pediatric travel nurse, floating patients. untill rich get swindled get quick test little nothing. speed bit (but outrage slow process) continue so.  
 
Yes failed hard first, truly think vaccination train really gets going go quite smooth. tend quite good logistical operations kinks cable. Hey man that's cash money  


you put vaccine let person go. 
In India, person Stay 45 min hospital taking vaccine. 
This make sure allergic reactions taking it. done outdoor clinic hospitals. 
Those limited numbers people injected day. west, Google Apple know are. Also highest density cameras UK, example, another western country. never heard anyone complaining isolate China? everyone isolates chances getting goes down. Many people blaming Trump symptom selfish behaviour large percent us population. Hey curious, where's Jack at?  Thats I’m fixing roof...ouch West, largest corporations Google Apple know everyone is.

Don't know rather trust government mega-corps. Oh look goalposts moved yet Switzerland supposed pretty neat tracking app, focus privacy, sure became it. That’s he’s doing. 

He’s trying make crime give vaccine people aren’t prioritization group. sounds good theory, means vaccines ever close going bad, one groups around, go waste, rather go someone else, unless DR feels like going jail paying fine. 

His suggested policy makes likely vaccine would wasted get thrown out. expected transparent forthright country possibly something hide. /s kind person reads whole article?

I need headline first 2 sentences form opinion. Today boyfriend's father returned trip New Orleans wants us meet him. traveled via plane stayed casino hotel. hard no.

Yesterday boss let coworker know may going home early last night symptoms ""the vid"" came work anyway feeling fineish morning. Thank gosh wearing masks STILL. first time boss covid symptoms come work anyway thought something else.

I've gotten tested covid least 3 4 times. None positive yet, I've going work since May I've careful. find really hard fathom coworkers never gotten covid test. seriously doubt almost year none typical covid symptoms. feel like one taking virus seriously even though I'm grateful job I'm scared (again) caught covid someone came work have. clear health safety rules I'm really frustrating upper management violate them. 

I want vaccine bad, I'm early 20s idea I'm going able get it. news mutations really scaring me. Even I'm technically likely overcome virus someone else want flippant life. article states planning sequence 2 million tests, say anything results. 

If accurate though would indicate proportion s-dropout cases doubled 4 times 2 months another month could mean much much 5%. Even 5% cases December that's easily hundreds thousands. 

It difficult say though US sequence large number cases. noticable numbers early stages exponential growth could still spreading rapidly. Yeah. Texas specifically Well hopefully right U.S.? local/state health department might something say it. Sheriffs aren’t enforcing lockdowns parts California. Bojack Horseman made murder legal, rich. China faster think

In fact Shijiazhuang closed airport, highways train stations agree journalist correct bringing facts :)

Seriously though agree would nice know bad stuff. problem getting there. maybe privacy laws, people care stuff. person nothing illegal, law might protect them. I’m sorry, what’s wrong this? need many people get vaccinated possible he’s making big deal frivolously throw away desperately needed doses. federal government abandoned effort states step figure out. 

I’m honestly curious said this. truly think bad thing? study french....i studied cherokee would useful once.

disclaimer...no offense meant cherokee speakers it’s joke. indigenous languages protected preserved. someone UK, yep right. doubling hospitalizations drop-off May is... wow. capacity continue exceeded nobody knows when. 
 
Dark times indeed. words. :( I’d say 80k dead yearly acceptable number. Basically bad flu season. clearly acceptable number endemic illness existed COVID, since didn’t shut them. Ex-Vancouverite here. get used rain. handle lack sunshine. wondering CCP CHINA hiding ???? hmmm!! Yea work minor flow rates like COPD patiemt living home.

 


They can't ever even get close 15+ l/min patients need.

Like need combine several even get 15. patients 60l/min. crazy.

 


 


Like they'll start rotating oxygen cylinders, actual piping support much combined flow. Simply notade supply enough oxygen half taps hospital wide open.  virus ""live"" outside host cell studied. 
So need prepare solution exactly replicates condition living cell keep alive lab. 
You use live-cell virus tends mix DNA cell mutate. 
Old solution covid mutated covid v2 one able study properly till now. math. $1300 average American rent.....

7,692,307 months rent could paid 1,000,000 x $10,000 vaccines doses. american exceptionalism is? Question anyone- bombarded bad news CA. can’t find short term ICU crisis nursing assignment Cal like heard facilities called NYC (3-4 weeks)? I’ve contacted least 10 agencies. want help, feels like one letting me. I’m beyond frustrated. Hearts y’all. What’s fucked hospitals bleeding money massively inadequate government assistance al this. , it’s surprising gotta make ends meet shut down. Jan 20th can’t come soon enough. likely people would buy convenient way dropping shipment ... Either office dropbox location handing assistant know mean.  

The FDA approved rapid tests although think still need prescription. IIRC there's one $25-$30 makes colored lines self read. checked Alameda county 9 months postponement. used 1 year past. used called lot jury duty past learned procedures. common knowledge thing I'm missing?

nah probably not. commonly known Texas bigger France, like 15,000 square miles. France quite bit populous TX, idea comparison.

Being proud Texan am, went looking nation could toss size comparisons TX, close TX size population, TX bigger areas. Turns Afghanistan fits bill.

TLDR, know we're fucken huge we're home fuckloads people  O:-) wasn’t imposing framework anyone. It’s medically immoral. Medical ethics agreed upon people profession. influence that. I’ve accepted terms pointing inconsistent agreed upon terms. post something like needs outweigh needs many. ashamed  surprised think would live event . line people throw like darts soon fix freezing issue not? NC actually considered illegal teacher refuse report absolutely fireable offense. wish teachers would follow suit firing every teacher already shortage would impossible. Florida? ""Florida gives less zero fucks covid"" stories memes false? dont care want MINE got feeling, also, still pretty major move right? can't imagine relative suffering heart attack, taken hospital right away. left there... guy invented piano key necktie. extensive contact tracing system, testing 500 thousand people every single day begun round 2 extremely strict lockdown. never said approached perfectly even well. however, believe wide spread infections unavoidable. virus allready UK spread throughout significant amount population knew severity transmission rate. point virus got Australia New Zealand. Oh knows. There’s longer usual line Pearly Gates too. hope ok wearing pants shirt Thanks!  I'm emphasizing treatment losing ground vaccines still ways away. 

If treatment work effectively, even though struggling is, system handle highly infectious variant current rate infection 6 months? dealing criminal cases common wisdom mess it. legislatures courts mess law procedure, likely appellate court could overturn conviction 5 10 years. could see happening civil cases sure though, since much less due process afforded civil parties Well can’t immediately lockdown. Authorities give couple days week notice people prepare there’s panic. Obviate means make unnecessary. don’t understand appearance second strain makes vaccine first strain unnecessary.

A better usage would be: “the death every single human within continental 48 states obviated need faster vaccine rollout.”  theory framework understanding. viruses get less lethal time theory, rule thumb.

and never said tradeoffs, fact theory viruses get less virulent time. claim theory isn't. theory mean rough idea science.


but go google papers read understand argue, amusing.

My double major university georgia published microbiologist, consider second maybe know talking about.


Or keep spewing hoary old chestnut acting like fact. since they're civil law.

... um, what? [You jury trials civil least U.S. yet are, friend. world already ended 350000 us....Who next.....? know probably heard drink plenty water!! hope feel better mend quickly. &lt;3 long morals consistent, qualms. many people would choose differently you, including me.

Remember everyone different ethical frameworks questionable portray views others (for example, utilitarians) immoral. means anything, covid still around 10% death rate elderly risk. It’s still high disease might still well survive Loose law California seems state wide mantra follow rules celebrities teens; see struggling pandemic trust schools even though cali dem. party thing, policy thing. Hence politics. Police New Jersey, state red leadership would confront state vehicles. California waited hospitals full start screaming rooftops. either New York screaming rooftops prevent catastrophe, New Jersey, arresting violators. Maybe there's between, states. Imagine living Florida. *put gun head emoji;* Wow suspicious all. Also block now? allow one team first breaking out? hide now? reason need get front liners first especially healthcare keeps working get exposed. 

One issues November many workers limited staffing. times hospitals 300-400 exposed. imagine guidance change full vaccination. state vaccinating tandem. Nursing homes Medicare. nursing homes nearly 70% deaths. Starting Feb 75+ another group. imagine mid May see decline hospitalizations deaths. imagine time J&amp;J online fingers crossed, moving better life.. ""That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over! fuck gonna now? gonna do?""

I can't imagine first post would like actually zombie outbreak one day. Look conflicting information first started. conflicting actions ""elites"" performed. can't quick die though, might spark small ever growing regional war. something hits elderly first, gradually works way down. I've pointed people China treated outbreak biological weapons attack, successful, heck, victorious actions.  Question would whether would want 10K freezer. People generally skimp -80s company say Thermofisher, likely going go it. labs least, look good deals consumables pay premium good equipment. months safety testing. something created quickly doesn’t mean approved quickly. Yes started vaccinated 4wks ago, must gotten doses already  It’s ok miss homies May well let people try single dose measure efficacy way. data may limited, far promising. idiot* Deadly disease.

Meanwhile close businesses make wear masks even work.

Read books communism tyranny is, stop following media boy really think government really cares now? guys brainwash you, feed coke Mcdonald burgers that. wish knew answer. credible claim vaccine causes infertility. Several women original vaccine trial became pregnant. facebook posts falsely claiming quotes pfizer researchers spreading disinformation. incredibly hard pressed find physician anywhere supporting wild accusations. Personally, wife getting vaccine available plan kids point. Yup, that’s me! You’re local fuckhead :) I’m jury duty 🤞 think point discussion shift “should open/close schools” move “how get teachers vaccinated ASAP.” That’s really way reopen schools way involve massive illness death. turn trash compactors detention level! That’s big reason expecting masks magically fix everything dumb. Masks help reduce direct transmission people seem think everyone wears mask won’t Covid Cases dropping contact tracing... Higher 7 days ago 29th. Sitting home watching TV. *pretends shocked* dumb ass read ""Mass Evacuation"" almost shit myself. It’s truly damned do, damned don’t. Vaccinate someone isn’t deemed worthy protection, Damn you! Let doses expire enough people vaccinated time, Damn you! Thanks confirming age. anyone gotten eye floaters covid? positive october, eye floaters 40% smell taste recovered. assume i've permanently lost 3 senses? :( believe that's likely case world, see, got handle virus spread.

The US Europe ""most world"". terms number countries, population, majority world ok far. number cases India, example, dropping weeks now.  household concentrators go certain level, 2-3 liters per minute O2 flow. high needs covid patients needing much this, like 6-8liters+. put high flow oxygen worse, vent them, it’s going more. make heart heavy. Ugh.. currently trying recover covid isolating someone SO's work basically became super spreader work infecting almost 80 percent workplace. employee everyone believes spreader work spent 6 days ICU able function oxygen need intensive lung type rehab found today. good. agree statement. allergist actually advised get vaccine yet severe allergies. name probably allergic it, aside tree nuts. also food allergies. said order get I'd either office epi hand neb close hospital immediate medical attention need be. know ""IF"" small chance still high risk get anaphylaxis rather easy. cannot even get shot allergist right offer it. work healthcare Medical Assistant primary care setting. mixed feelings vaccine campaign create vaccine called operation warp speed. even like flu vaccine. lot research college learned flu constantly mutating play guessing game every year strain active. read somewhere day COVID-19 mutated 28 times within past year, making less severe contagious due spike virus hooks onto cells. question is. mutated 28 times already mean vaccine every year mean they're constantly going playing guessing game mutation active? food thought. I'm saying GET ALL, studies done I've seen vaccine works population I'll make decision. I'll best infection prevention. California able defer one year reason given. country (Alameda) long court website defer specified week future. date may choose call again. Multiply 100 get %? good odds 50+  Surely, good. Fortunately Grammys, right call. Unfortunately Grammys, one cares anyways. Wearing mask people around yourself. Wearing mask protect covid... Acting like hands jurors fucking stupid. needs systemic protection, global fucking pandemic *literally never handle country entire duration* History says certain percentage people aggressively stupid infectious disease, sometimes even going far reject proven benefits vaccines deadly diseases frivolous grounds. family member healthcare worker LA believes never closed businesses due COVID everything open right now. mileage may depending worker pick. also works hospital highest number COVID patients county. tried debate bit, could see going budge position gave hope get fast enough. He'd already served year half theft case? Jesus Christ. Plead shit give time served. Chinese politician said thing, problems going around saying ""China says xxx"". let's use standard comes United States.  leaders going keep letting people die?

yes lol  Probably varies lot, first jury notice given space explain given exemption, medical, primary career child, self employed etc. it’s hard excused. Need graphic showing total time. Nothing see hear call sometimes. report tell send home. think mandatory sentence? Capitalism pretty based kinda cringe.

Literally work risk life die poverty. Hope stay safe dude. Scary... currently isolated testing positive covid Jan 2nd... health symptoms started toward end Dec. really worried wave worse this. careful anywhere went think would current situation. really scary.   Become? Let's honest here, always lol. Australia went way harder UK ever went. 'lockdowns' half-hearted attempts seen something without making hard decision. Australia UK's situation would much better position now. failures result politics failed divisive leadership deny that, continue vote them, blame ""demographics.""

-5.05M doses given US


-17,020,575 doses distributed mean, everyone knows DMV slog, they're famous it. Though Texas purposes DMV bad, preset appointment. Go website, pick DMV office, pick day time, set appointment, boom done. Go day, aim 15 minutes early make sure late, call name time, go. 

And look back sad sacks who've waiting since 8 am, wondering F set appointments (unless Internet get Starbucks library) I'm accounting two shot regimen. CDC estimates 100m doses Pfizer Moderna end February. Extrapolating assuming growth due vaccine approvals, production scaling, single-shot vaccines, easily requisite number doses. Probably well end Spring even.

Note delivered 1.6m doses yesterday. That's already 48m/mo production rate. They're great job production. need match administration rates. Ya think?
So sure let’s fuck vax plan up...give plenty mutate. Hell let’s mink thing too. Let’s party. Nice play words. Visas processed = China blocks. article clearly states China speeding internal processes get team cleared entry. lot processes make huge amounts. Idk works, pretty cheap. 

Logistics though, that's another question.

It also ultra pure medical purposes. helps too. know exactly district talking parents district first ones try sue city, county, governor, God Satan precious little Ayshtyn, Braxtyn Xvrghi (pronounced Avery) get covid wind hospital   Man new variant definitely taking things new level National Guard isn’t free infinite resource though. also don’t support door door method, although get spirit behind comment. Realistically, communities reserving doses priority populations start prepping major Point Dispensing (POD) locations. POD built *exercised* means dispensation medical goods like medicine, water, vaccines. It’s community would use issue meds disaster events. location centralize resources, improve efficiency, allow flexibility. It’s frustrating PODs aren’t stood Tier 1 strategically located sites could dispensing vaccines rapidly instead clogging hospitals clinics coordination doesn’t exist level needs to. National Guard members could easily support healthcare workers kinds locations. time, utilizing National Guard comes issues aren’t free. States pay provide resources.

It’s also hard I’m coordination calls LTCs SNFs don’t know send people vaccines get residents vaccinated. needs aren’t matched up, there’s serious lack situational awareness sides. Government doesn’t know listen healthcare partners need, healthcare partners aren’t victims either. don’t know go information, emergency preparedness *expectation*. already prepared know look leadership. Additionally, collaborative. can’t stand organizations selfish enough disengage community wide emergency response efforts.

We’ve started domino effect would continue getting worse even zero emission worldwide today may say parroting one theory explaining virulence spread based evolution selection.

No, really accepted fact making out. general tendency evolve less lethal time, says fuckall means generation generation far selection commonly stated idea often evolutionary trade-off virulence transmissibility intra-host virus replication necessary facilitate inter-host transmission may also lead disease, impossible natural selection optimize traits simultaneously. case MYXV, trade-off thought lead ‘intermediate’ virulence grades selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean rabbit host dies inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence selected increase virus transmission rates. similar trade-off model proposed explain evolution HIV virulence40. However, many doubts raised general applicability trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness affected traits virulence transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results observed experimental studies45 relatively little known evolutionary trade-offs nature. example, case second virus released biocontrol European rabbits Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — evidence virulence increased time, probably virus transmission often occurs blow flies feed animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies plant RNA viruses shown high virulence necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, case malaria, higher virulence shown provide Plasmodium parasites competitive advantage within Ah ok, could see that. Still think it’s unlikely, doesn’t seem farfetched. Thank helping understand True hybrid probably best approach limits spread without accountability students dropping person check ups North TX, normal get charged court like least 3-12 months initial arrest. usually least 6 months me, go trial adds time defendant officially charged sentenced right term, think. TX loves arresting people though, since there's state income tax, get money toll roads arresting kids pot. honestly started really well. summer even city size Toronto got single digit daily cases. second wave fucked get go though. Pfizer approved 16+ Moderna 18+. 

They testing younger right now. may vaccinated later point currently approved. want ditch shitty 9-5 boss working home scraping nutter butters good cause?

Tbh fucking idea would look like beyond shit like, ""with coconut oil!"" ""Only finest warm-pressed Zimbabwean nuts!"" [Scientists predicted something like COVID19 going happen back There’s bunch zoonoses threats also predicted. research would definitely help, it’s problem people wanting listen knowing Vaccinating people least amount time possible going save lives way they’re now. least separate queue priority people allow others start getting vaccinated time. It’s like don’t millions expiring doses sitting freezers glad do!!!! Sad true sounds delightful one mutation one virus individual change ball game.

Which important limit number cases, via lockdowns social distancing, masks w/e, even vaccines start rolled out. Well looks like found origins.  go home now. believe numbers China? people say nothing significant happened 1989? also said 200 million March weeks ago. That’s way 1 million per day. He’s throwing random numbers point. Wearing right kind mask absolutely protects covid. Go buy N95 KN95 masks use instead cloth mask.  Source stating waiting source? reason worried South African variant? “We tweak vaccine 6 weeks” doesn’t sound promising considering FDA loves take sweet time we’d vaccinate everybody again. evades antibodies throw another year away I’m anymore. Sorry grandma. I’m sure amplicon PCR tests. IE much virus genome actually amplified PCR. don’t know anything nonviable virus either, whether normal genome, incomplete genome empty virus. parents stuck home part. It’s kids mostly asymptomatic precautious sick. agree. least week two away done healthcare LTC staff/residents.

How states populous NJ NY barely used third supply given three weeks ago now? lot ""Phase 1A"" folks refused vaccine? so, move next group.

You'd think vaccinating Athlete's Foot pace they're going. Honestly, they're caught time next week, need start opening first come first serve access. much infuriating hear vaccines sitting around vaccine even approved. Might want think twice hopping first flight back LAX... issue every system vastly different. It’s National Guard staff suck—they’re super qualified. National Guard limits reuse PPE, many hospitals can’t afford since contingency status supplies. understand needing protect workers, major hurdle working together. Another hurdle create agreement outlines duties, tasks, costs. That’s totally normal takes time attention inhibits flexibility sites. Also CARES dollars needed much it’s hard pill swallow. can’t easily added and/or removed (as get activated demobilized) EHR support staff still needed handle documentation: release signing, scanning, etc.

It’s don’t like aren’t good do; it’s logistics nigh impossible coordinate often lead short term agreements ineffective sites. Chicago average 34k? Really? That’s insane true Ok. I’ve careful pandemic. would hate get vaccine around corner always better denied entry China denied exit it. Climate change absolutely issue. fired IMO. It’s like surgeon refuses scrub surgery. insane? Yep too. Two buddies told parents ( one brother ) , Two moms closest friends , sisters coworker husband died  neighbor whose brother died . Someone got office potentially exposed 10 others ( us working home remotely right now) . within past 3 weeks California.

 


T due respect, US would also dragging feet letting investigate position China. easy summer people saying backed response Australia. couple months lockdown seems like nothing now. glad charge listen vocal minority.

Out last death covid long enough ago can't even recall was. concerning. last two mutations (UK SA) successful. read vaccine works since bird flu, years ago.

Teenagers get drunk, government puts tax alcohol try make less affordable teenagers. Everyone pays alcohol. Teenagers start taking recreational substances cheaper get high get drunk, ice epidemic starts. ‘I conclude proved **insufficiently agile** able accommodate changes occurred quickly enough,’ said. ‘I could asked health boards earlier prepare… knowledge expertise large-scale vaccination campaigns.’

Politician speak ""useless"". France better NL vaccinations clear someone probably looking new job. provides level protection, least offers wearer protection vs mask less. course applied visas. tried send team China months, China keeps stalling delaying deployment. need basic phage research, apply phages bacteria infected wound phages stick around prevent infection target species, antibiotics don’t that. evolve bacteria. would say already everywhere.

I'm currently locked government Quarantine Facility NZ - super strict protocols, well done, keeps covid country - new variant already hotel.

Hopefully systems place work, never leaves hotel gets population. spamming everywhere? What's agenda? suspect lot people calling lockdowns experienced able afford comfortable. 2 kids right sitting front screens lockdown “learning”. It’s obvious getting nearly enough mental physical stimulation. Thanksgiving wave, wait til Christmas/ new years eve wave. close schools. children may get ill, still infected passing alarming rate, seen fact teachers testing positive 3.3X normal rate. they're dying, mean they're driving mutations. Single dose would great! feeling general population starts getting two-part vaccine we’re gonna see lot folks wasting first dose getting second one time. Bet it’s one new strains Friendly ICU nurse here: even mask home try social distance I’m exposed nearly daily. backing point. Waiting mine, start getting treatment medcal issues without much risk. Grocery runs still 7 mask goggles case count way down.
I hope get killed mutates something deadly unaffected vaccine. think **is** great news! summer, nobody care 9 days delay. 

Best wishes snowy Zürich. trouble tracking Australia cases day team numbering thousands.

In USA hope. K........ future! Hospital capacity increase. Sheesh. make beds tents fill hospitals brim. good beds cannot staffed appropriate professionals? 

And would like non-COVID emergency treated? want ICU bed staffed first year RN? Seriously think it. I’ll use last example physicians, everyone glorifies doctors (though hospitals exist nursing care). want podiatrist bypass surgery? want hear surgeon? ICU, want nurse trained critical care. long pandemic raging, short supply. worse California? I’m horrified California we’ve got Arizona too. thought rationing problem socialised medicine?

Quick make people pay care put price up. B4 get excited...   tests Los Angeles-based company currently available single packs cost $110 10-pack $1,000 Amazon. DxTerity said price includes pre-paid overnight return shipment testing company’s CLIA licensed accredited laboratory. yet. thanks! googling yielded nothing! yesterday’s Cuomo press conference, said dashboard would coming listing various hospital systems. attenuated virus vaccine, old trusted vaccine tech. take SARS-COV-2 expose chemical kills it. quick way making lots vaccine. claim provides 80% protection, grand. require cold storage.

Also, avoid problems posed mutations Spike protein, since whole stay inside. Lol may start IM injections one prescription meds (Sustanon) soon; Happen tutorial resources laying around?

My doctor wants inject upper buttock, impossible get right angle myself, I've heard thigh injection option real manual I'd like sure YT tutorials I've watched actually correct, seem vary ever slightly one. 

Tips also appreciated, come mind want bother digging stuff. manufacturer held liable injuries future?

No. Why? Lol I’m still waiting see borders reopen try emigrate. dont know voted. Congratulations losing weight. majority overweight people way diet. want take responsibility though. would rather live less life deserve burden families, communities government. mom terrified virus leaving home letting anyone continues eat crap barely move around overweight. lifestyle diet going kill prematurely sure guess care that. understand terrified dying virus increase chances survival losing weight? people want put effort live subpar shorter life. waste could be. Congratulations keep up. Hopefully inspire others. problem ""UK"" variant could come anywhere, possibly France due prevalence Kent, already detected 41 countries. 

Borders closed non-essential travel everyone travelling internationally (or all) tested.

Other restricting direct flights South Africa (currently) Denmark (for short period previously) UK almost unique allowing foreign travellers arrive throughout pandemic. Someone fired image chosen news. call one Covid-20, great way honour 2020 ask really. 

Yes, really. pretty basic maths. take current rate deaths - call 100/day make easy, 10k people infected (1% death rate - again, convenience). Infections double (20k) 1/3 (your number) deaths prevented vaccine end deaths 133/day ICUs remain full.

My point simple making be. Whether ICU numbers drop number vaccines delivered, vaccinated everyone age 65 (which soon) 

It'll several months, asking Boris shut country 6 weeks now.  guy capitalists photo tho lol It’s gonna end yearly shot like flu (I predict). Respect, worked lab tech parasitology lab (cryptosporidium, gardia,) two lab specialties. Zoonoses via water supply. I’m referencing return normalcy. nothing death toll. ZERO people die, long enough get sick enough need critical care overwhelm system, can’t return way things were. I'll allow it. assured would ask reasoning treated her. reason good one, since asking validation, please know someone PhD relevant field. Italy since months full masks mandate basically outside home anytime near someone, get disease booty disappeared long time ago. Obviously believe masks make lot easier, enough. Covid seen airborne disease, feel like precautions would enforced. droplet disease, national mask mandate kick off?  section bullets summaries case studies, footnotes source documentation.

tl;dr - reduces risk becoming infected 70% ones work hospital? farfetched all. We've done similar research creates new viruses US banned due concerns deadly uncontrollable viruses accidentally leaking. Maybe likes semen lips.   wrong don’t mind rich people cutting line means gets faster? Obviously completely hogging like Stanford preventing medical residents front line getting vaccine would one thing, 1-2% going extremely rich means give several thousand people need per day, fair price going faster reaching people need sooner. mean, right 10 million doses US prepared ready unused. definitely handing faster. Treatment polyclonal antibody treatment? Cuomo revealed bit putz late, least came basically said sites NY given vaccines pick pace immediately, basically stuff it. Good call. I’m board that. miss Taiwan greatly, spent semester studying abroad years back. culture Taiwan friendliest Asia I've encountered, society whole seems mindset benefits everyone. garbage removal proper queues MRT. intend move Taichung Chiayi open-ended years, provided still tolerate Americans ARC, haha. likely virus circulating early September 2019, China - possibly earlier. know almost 100% certainty virus originated China. But, usually, transmissible viruses less lethal? Kind goes survival goals virus kill host. 18,400. surreal. think would worst come, nope. people still eating restaurants. “May” key word. Also may not. Fuck dude. virus never ceases match surpass expectations. Every single time there's slice hope maybe going bad seems, Covid rolls around n says ""NOPE!"" slapping us right tha fuckin mouth. virus self. Thinking get select strain, matter. natural selection. Typically, greater. Lethality correlates less transmissibility limitates propagation. Greater transmissibility typically. Correlates less lethality because, well, need to.move around transmit virus.

However sars-cov-2 part class virus transmissible onset symptoms. need trade-off. lethality transmissibility, since someone highly contagious even get sick. virus becomes lethal, still affect transmissibility. Yes, first 4 weeks slower ran max capacity day one, starting week 5, going need second shot SOL there's extra capacity. However capacity 1 million shots per day, means want deliver vaccines 250 million people means deliver 500 million injections. 500 million shots / 1 million capacity = 500 days. 

If want reach goal say 250 million people six months, deliver 500mil/180 days, need deliver 2.77mil day. I’m sorry. Sending thoughts peace. Yep that's one fucking scared me



Also surprised talks airborn transmission confirmed spring? really confused would need reaffirming.  amazing movie. One Brad Pitt's best roles...and well-made movie. one movies watch over, see new things missed last time around. Obsessing shit like get ridiculously slow, overly regulated rollout. get needles arms quit dallying.

This society built. Trying fix middle pandemic vaccine rollout make slower us waiting turn get doses. keep rolling out. Fix society afterward. Everyone clumped streets LA. Watch movie ""Falling Down"" see visualization streets LA. Eh. Donnie signed one, Joseph one better. Good. lot places dont luxury. Damn, Texas... scary “country”! describing US?? know that, I'm saying article says evading antibodies.  course happened! Honestly, jury, I'd probably check suing county reckless endangerment. got covid anywhere even close trial, change ""probably"" ""definitely"". literally never model education history even come close successful mass education Public School systems are. US's system limping along government run shitheads mean better alternatives. Pfizer's 52% floor, keeps rising time. extrapolate existing data, first dose alone provide 89% protection 21 days, maybe 91% 28 days. Table 1,  lol getting downvoted?

Just vaccinating teachers schools reopen dangerous stupid. turn daily super-spreader event teachers immune. Thots prays parents back home. lot parents know still want daycare. They're used around kids much. kids school months. sickness teachers kids ~10 kids, fine. I’m sorry hear that. Sounds like really shitty situation. hope extremely mild case recover quickly. experience, zoom trials done better civil setting. can’t said criminal trials. example, many criminal defense attorneys adamantly opposed zoom trials. variety reasons one jurors judge credibility witnesses person way doesn’t translate zoom. sure mean let people waiting walk town go home, ok. didn’t say couldn’t done (I’ve seen creative solutions), it’s pushing limits safety. sure many people eager spend 8 hours day week smallish room 20 people, particularly places zero ICU beds available. take back I'll shoot face. say live Maryland seen Hogan seems like gets it. Maryland people say something different respect know. seems like guy follows science.  country stopped publishing stats, covered bunch stuff, history shady practices?

 No. Taiwan definitely higher per capita GDP US. still give Grammys? worry, we'll use guns fight masks Fuck em. Next! Hmmm. Well, guess around hospitals vending machines, cafeterias, restaurants Starbucks. Emergency Rooms vending machines. Even Urgent Care vending machines.   Working herd immunity. several months since got sick, antibody test may come negative even covid. heads up. realize theyre going hold second dose everyone received first right? vaccines given Federal funding.

We really can’t catch break thing, we? mean can’t virus point? never thought I’d live 9/11, Green Recession, next Great Recession, end world either virus, mother nature, nuclear bomb world going crazy. haven’t heard vaccine hoarded, point towards news sources?

Also, please don’t encourage people start breaking vaccine freezers. means won’t ability store vaccine won’t able prioritize first short need second shot complete vaccine schedule. would also lead riots people clamor first line get within small time frame can’t store vaccine properly. far, feds much better getting vaccinations provinces provinces getting arms. changes, welcome federalism. long mass produce distribute? understanding started producing current one months ago.

The county unvaccinated first responders, jail staff, nursing home residents - hospital hundreds doses apparently intend using day. treating doses distributing emergency? seem make sense though.  Yeah, that’s good enough. We’re getting real close point join team anarchy. actually same. Also think ive read june article earlier? might've different classifications virus kinds Russian, least one taught public. Airborn us mostly used non-droplet one, completely, lets put way, ""dry"". Air-dust one, air-droplet.



Tldr fucked loose translation medical terms called jury duty entire month January. obviously postponed massive spikes everywhere area really everywhere right now. couldn’t believe actually summoned though show person like wtf tennessee worse recently, that's improved since testing went down. hmm, heard think $34k low end. went strike 2019, said back teachers would make little $60k (starting salary), teachers PhD would make six-figures. Take grain LPNs 6 month accelerated training programs now. simple google search....they also nurses btw. flu wasn’t result single strain mutating lethal form.

Yeah, flu antigenic shift, still mutated became lethal used example opposite, pretty funny.

as certitude mutations cause viruses less virulent general commonly stated idea often evolutionary trade-off virulence transmissibility intra-host virus replication necessary facilitate inter-host transmission may also lead disease, impossible natural selection optimize traits simultaneously. case MYXV, trade-off thought lead ‘intermediate’ virulence grades selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean rabbit host dies inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence selected increase virus transmission rates. similar trade-off model proposed explain evolution HIV virulence40. However, many doubts raised general applicability trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness affected traits virulence transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results observed experimental studies45 relatively little known evolutionary trade-offs nature. example, case second virus released biocontrol European rabbits Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — evidence virulence increased time, probably virus transmission often occurs blow flies feed animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies plant RNA viruses shown high virulence necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, case malaria, higher virulence shown provide Plasmodium parasites competitive advantage within put another though viruses mutate less lethal forms themselves.

You can't prove could 99 percent, please try.  trouble one species host. virus super deadly humans long it’s bad animal host (take Ebola example). 

That’s it’s super fucking bad news SARS-COV-2 infected mink getting wild. Something that’s harmless may eventually jump humans future fuck shit way SARS-COV-2 jumped humans bat.  know downvoted, legitimate ethical case believing *some* teachers teach. say someone taught undergraduates person Fall PhD student clinic med student (MD/PhD program, seems weird). demographics, risks extremely low. many kids, especially low-income disruptive households, year distance learning could set back life. someone taught college students via distance learning, tell students manage, many others struggle format point practically useless. imagine effect K-12.

If consider mortality risk, risk death teacher 45-55 range catches COVID risk death cause year, ~0.2-0.3%. catching COVID basically doubles chance death year. However, teachers guaranteed get COVID go work. They're also guaranteed avoid stay home. quantify risk ratio. Let's assume 25% US gets COVID end. Let's assume teaching risk ratio 2 (so teachers 2x likely catch COVID teaching, essential workers experience, risk healthcare workers). actual increased risk death 45-55 year old teachers, teaching, would 0.1-0.25%, half risk normal death year causes.

The analysis applied age groups

25-35: ~0.01%

35-45: ~0.035%

55-65: ~0.4%

At age, risk close one half risk incurred ordinary, pre-COVID life. changes vanishingly small younger demographics significant older demographics. Normally I'd scoff asking anyone increase risk death job, consider we're asking *everyone* same. Denying child education increase his/her risk death future similar greater amount. Asking small business owner close increases his/her risk death socioeconomic factors. Asking single mother juggle kids home job stifles economy transfers even financial risk onto rest society. indirect, real. Financial, educational, mental health deficits kill people quantifiably.

Of course risk non-fatal injury. much higher, basal risk non-fatal injury. far likely permanent back problems car crash die one. COVID scales similarly.

The point? Life full risk, relative risk occupational COVID actually small. risk teacher probably far outweighed incurred risk negative life outcomes kids parents. one quantifying risk explicitly, consequences may take years decades manifest full.

Of course teachers going work, vaccines prioritized sent quickly possible. provided N95 masks (and face shields wish). However, believe low risk teach. decline humanity less virus primarily kills people age 40+, instead due people realizing decoupled fornication pregnancy chose former less latter. COVID spreading unabated year.

We know so-called ""UK"" ""SA"" variants sporadic testing. idea variants exist tested for, primarily US we've rampant spread without adequate testing.

I'm even going get point/counterpoint argument this. worth debating. COVID considered permanent virus human population contend anything ramifications reality, good bad, speculation worth digging one's heels particular perspective. Dude kids days social interact online lmao even truly call lockdown actual lockdown?

Since April, China anything except small localized clusters promptly stamped out. give BS numbers fake. able hide real epidemic gains momentum, people China hardly social distancing anymore.

Nah, fine leave China out. Mechanical isn’t expert virology. I’m sure he’s expert Fluid Dynamics, doubt would make expert virology. I’m doubting already know virus airborne need someone expert field show proof.

/s Wow 40% rejected vaccine? That’s fucking insane Inability hospital facility administer oxygen fear mongering, infrastructure collapse. happen, clear? Sorry wrong. According research people reported partial improvement one week, though full recovery take much longer. fell window Nobody uses LA metro Pfizer Moderna data shows reduce odds getting sick 95%. volunteers world 0% people around vaccinated. live Texas, exurbs Houston. don’t know school districts Texas this, they’re independent government bodies there’s often one county. I'm sure exactly what's going particular situation. However, Tedros appeared CCP's puppet beginning pandemic.  Yeah 52% relative 95% based gross misunderstanding two efficacy figures caculated muleiple people thread made.. depressingly common one continues popup despite explained time time again. probably others explained thread like 5 paragraphs. facts Moderna 92% one dose 95% two example using metrics measuring efficacy endpoint used. Pfizer similar. 

 also misunderstanding ""mix match"" guidelines fundamental level, disaster/contigency planning document. general advise. Every country similar document.. nytimes called reporting topic already 
 asked correct misleading statements ""mix matching "" article implying sort lucky dip

 Btw UK heterologous prime boost ('mix match"") trial despite nonsense testing done

Furthermore valid strategy boosting performance durability vaccines compared giving doses that's likely give helpful useful results, UK world  soldiers killed drilunl driving incidents overseas. used joke safer Iraq. two KIA's deployed (Sgt Rhett, roommate LT Runyon another Battalion). I've seen deaths celebratory drinking get home. suicides. Nah, exactly emotional, lived results flawed science past. 

To points, constantly told data. gametes issue, trial docs specifically lay 30 day period sexual activity required condom use. leads think someone thought damage sex cells definitely possible. official stance moderna phizer since studied. 

The piece life, plenty transcription errors, don’t know effects improper storage incorrect administration. 


My position one caution standard scientific stance. gung ho “VACCINATE WORLD” position one emotion. article read research magazine says one virus spikes mutated, could get around antibodies present ready virus, possibly around antibodies formed vaccine. worry fast spike protein's virus mutating finding ways around antibodies system. mutated short period time time happen generation virus life span (that hard word right sorry sound right). next mutation one forms spike protein's completely make vaccine good sure of, good chance really soon mutate way get around protection. Look picture article jurors sitting indoors face shields masks! idiotic state. I'd livid attorney work this. According 1.7% healthy 27ish year olds infected hospitalized. According thirty something year olds double risk, forty something year olds triple risk on. quarantine everyone entered country mandatory 14 days regardless test results. 

And primary contacts positive cases too, regardless test results. 

Then additional 7 days health monitoring allowed put mask still need report symptoms discouraged gatherings. (Most recent change ban large events)

The logic behind false negatives thing; 14 days infection unlikely contagious asymptomatic (you get tested show symptoms)

And get compensation too, unless deliberately went looking trouble (went sightseeing abroad middle pandemic)  I'm pretty sure every single bit 40% new response would threatening livelihood. 2023 looking good vaccine. live Canadian province that's acting pretty similar Vietnam. We're shutting pretty tightly 50ish cases. pretty great. biggest covid concerns come Americans people provinces following rules invade(moving low case counts) start delivery home. Like old days.  understand virus works think going happen. Viruses mutate time 99% become less deadly time. 

Viruses mutate time, normally single mutation host. small mutations often cancel out. enough make virus less deadly.

That talking here. talking new variants ten mutations occurred single host. changed property virus. became transmissible. 

The virus spreads, higher chances it'll mutate even more. current exponential growth, new variants guaranteed.

Viruses may become less fatal allows reproduce better. virus dead host can't reproduce. However, case SARS-CoV-2. virus already good reproducing. Moreover, reproduces 1st two weeks contagious, patients die 3 4 weeks. words, whether patient dies influence virus' reproduction.

There evolutionary pressure virus become less fatal. could even become fatal Spanish flu 2nd wave. interesting article NYMag covering virus may escaped lab. key thing keep mind come lab, likely accidental. 

There certainly people looking blame China say released purpose order score xenophobic political points. 

But U.S. funding research coronaviruses, changing research, could simply gotten lab. first time happened. chance still study? Oh. cdc’s rollout phases say get people first general public access vaccine.

The thing is, CDC recommendations followed, not. state say ""Yeah fuck that."" fact several have. title hella click-baity then. Right access blocked default coronavirus. authorized access per agreement. Go Aztecs!! That's point know athletic using picture. Kid could run work every day. point statistically?

Drunk driving deaths eclipse numbers. WTF! 

Why scare mongering articles even getting attention?!

I hate see Veterans used, like prostitutes, government fear merchants. bad, realized headline says ""healthy"". right, morbidly obese common definitely healthy anyone Covid comment long took sense smell taste return? day 4 testing positive Covid traditional flu experiencing moderate symptoms loss taste smell making even want eat anything. So, happened? fired?  Except care vaccines viruses do. care COVID does. Right enough evidence either way, would rather hedge bets ""maybe"". average salary 34K. Ranked 19th nation. US ranked 27th world. dare show up! /s good news viruses usually evolve transmissible less lethal.

A dead host efficient transmitting virus others actually like idea paying people get vaccinated. benefits vaccines experienced entire community, one vaccinated. think fair provide monetary incentives. paid people $10 (and covered cost administering it) get flu shot, would much higher vaccination rates IMO.

Many countries ""paid people stay home"" adding direct payments citizens lockdowns. That's another situation civic duty monetary compensation one Oh I’m buckled!! Covid fish taco edition!  people concerned quality masks?

&amp;#x200B;

I ask seems lot time energy wasted West arguing best possible mask, scientific proof superiority mask, etc. People seem think mask useless dangerous provide 100% protection virus person wearing it. see pictures Asian countries everyone mask, they're mostly wearing various fabric masks, look homemade. Honestly prob depends state bet Florida Texas much earlier Cali New York Definitely true... although weeks first dose, large percentage immunity she'll eventually have. effective really vaccine? people really safe getting it, even don’t like 80% population vaccinated well? This. I’m hygienist, state give local anesthesia shots (as long dentist office). kinda tricky shots get right spot right amount kind anesthetics. Vs shots which, within brand, probably could mixed drawn Dr Pharmacist shot administrators grab jab. bet people like could easily retrained afternoon give shot Dr nearby. People like partner, isn’t pro, acted assistant charity events things like patient education translation could also volunteer give people aftercare info set second shot appointment etc. Vax train people like I’d delighted it, especially got paid fair wage. get yearly flu vaccines, shoot arms guess ask state? curious shitty grade policy state based district based. either way super unfair families wanted remote. mean? anything advertisement every actually instant? mom would knees. Go work. See girlfriend. See mistress. Go shopping. Go travel. Live yor life. Newson doesnt care. 

Just dont throw big noisy party go restaurant corporate event. gets obvious disrespecting government. thing discreetly wont waste time prosecuting you.  virus' huge entity one genetic code mutates once.

I say did. Yeah, I've shit times stating that. currently know. enough data evidence either way. many wishful thinking makes reality advocates here.  Keep wearing masks? Yeah, hate ""at risk"" used refer likely catch likely develop serious complications die it. makes conversations like confusing. actually know fire departments ability levy fines, assumed secondary body would responsible that. Thanks educating me!  hospital would let would happy put vaccines arms day without rest don’t let us march pharmacy start distributing vaccine. poor understanding medical operations cruel nature. believe word he's searching 'RESPONSIBLE'.

Looking pass buck incompetence. Look happened Spanish Flu. year later? cares now? Anything would compromise China gone already.  validated way, shape, form. know (yet). I'd rather bet maybe. According redditors, Newsom Vaccinating medical care workers first hardly virtue signaling. Even countries taking approach recommending (based age) still medical workers mentioned specifically high priority may vaccinating people, still need medical workers handle COVId cases might come unvaccinated groups, there's fact simply going dealing COVID patients may provide care someone car accident.  exactly. believe even vaccinated person shed enough virus load cause infection others. stick arm please. neighbors arm. Anybody’s arm. drive vectors. It’s better nothing. Yeah refused hour duty year something like this. knew couldn’t guarantee safety. refused go in. I'm saying I'm one people, go work go home !@#$ off. work shopping plaza ever since holidays like people forgotten there's deadly pandemic spreading around. Parking lot stores always packed take statistics shove em sun shine. Look it’s going. I’d say virus pretty successful. China doesn’t “it didn’t come lab” argument favors. think so. even eventually get caught delays already cost 100s lives growing everyday. think made call? long history surviving actions policies various superpowers? Depends entirely (and US, state in). Try checking local department health page information. continuing freedoms pandemic 3.5k deaths day right now

No, isn't. incompetent leaders. New Zealand Taiwan free countries case. Meanwhile people dying thousands Russia.

I submit totalitarian government guys nothing contain pandemic. We're leaders (both US Europe) downplayed threat nothing late, army shooting deniers street.

There huge chain mismanagements, incompetence putting money people's lives. society's fault, least we're lucky kick fuck up. Chinese can't even complain. Glad live in/near city. die quickly happened 92? So, you’re saying there’s chance! Thank telling NY/NJ Vaccine situation. take politics subreddit subreddit dedicated r/Politics. speaking vaccine distribution looks like Shoprite 21 NJ counties covered. Dont need qualify lmfao get risk group vaccinated there’s reason start slowly opening things up.  Stop making excuses get work. endless china myth feeding wall street failing solid year reading 40% teachers intelligent enough continue teaching over. parents got today.

All essential employees town gotten 65+ crowd. Locally owned pharmacies leading charge vaccines 3-5pm.

Amazing stupid, racist, rednecks/black folks etc etc south Georgia figure it’s hard others. 

The statement tongue cheek find humorous podunk town vaccinated enlightened metropolis live now. think that’s totally understandable. outsider, seems Japanese culture gets hit lot stereotypes, positive negative. 
Though say, husband visited, treated kindly everyone. really great. conclusion unsupported evidence--it's pure speculation hope.

I'm misunderstanding saying. saying never eradicate virus hope vaccine efforts keep control.

There ""return normal life developed countries"" virus runs rampant under-developed nations. That's reality 21st century. world interconnected think like that. reality Los Angeles goes business wild minks Oregon hold reservoirs virus hop, spread, mutate at-will unabated.

The thing holds true virus ""variants"" spreading unabated South Africa.

The person took issue pointed succinctly: control virus period time, takes one person new variant resists vaccine cause global lockdowns. continue develop new vaccines, even optimistic claim take couple months update mRNA vaccines...meanwhile, international cities like ones live (SoCal) locked down. redistribute vaccine around world.

If start treat medical infrastructure like military infrastructure might chance get ahead this, given people like Fauci others predicted since teen 80s lot hope occur.  doesn’t need stop treating Americans like children.

soon stop acting like children -- sure getting Covid Pro Max haven’t finished paying Covid Tedros Adhanom Chinas pocket anyways i'm surprised wanted ""investigate"" That's junk preprint. using try win arguments jfyi. “Other downvoted opinion”

Well, well infections came ignorant Americans s/ Yes UK vaccine much earlier EU bought 6 months before. gamble paid I’m expert, imo based way things trending, don’t think events 50 people gonna green light anytime soon. Even rollout vaccine, things getting worse businesses gearing another shutdown. Hospitals around already cancelled elective surgeries make room COVID patients. Again, I’m expert epidemiologist anything, money, I’d push things back couple months see things going rather losing deposits cancelled event. Thank answer! think outdoor mask compliance much higher many places west. impressive considering many places experience cases day Taiwan seen year

 certainly many places higher percentage normal single layer cotton masks, vs medical masks N95. sadly uncommon see people wear nose either

I think one part reason spread higher west. slow adopt kind mask wearing here, time virus already seeded deeply. 

I think west pay attentio response Taiwan example potential next pandemic fail get 20 million vaccinated end week. What's next excuse? Ok fire them. gonna replace with....? movies viruses evolve like that. 

More lethal rare outside shortly crossing humans.  believe see course money used go international tourism flows Taiwan’s local market higher priority living? Wow. teacher feel fellow colleagues every day. valued way pretended read first-hand experiences understand willingly.

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: policeman protesters deserved this. clear that. linked article indicates Texas suspended jury trials March June, creating backlog take court system years clear out. experimented ""Zoom trials"" apparently experimenting resuming in-person trials think lot younger people. Idahoan say “healthy”, lot younger people (50 under) China people guilty proven innocent? Microwaves existed way longer 15 years though? relate. Man, think weird would freezers kept breaking everyone vaccinated /s

In seriousness hope start working getting vaccines arms sooner without moved due equipment failure. mean people show within 2 hours vaccine? automatically get second dose got first shot? honestly think question posted lol incredibly sad. young. wouldn’t categorize “healthy” category however. Heart problems prevalent men, even young men teens especially US diet high sugar, fats, cholesterol actually put work exercise it’s easy drive everywhere never even walk much day day. 

Men US pretty big tall. puts lot strain heart pump blood body constantly. Couple poor diet little exercise cardiac arrest happens lot would think. 

With said average American, guess it’s good thing young deaths newsworthy rare. Yeah still willfully ignorant.

 proposed hypothetical pfizer vaccines destroyed contaminated unplanned. (E.g freezer malfunction, patients showing dose thawing) none scenarios relevant promise allocation second doses promises protect insure possibilities occuring . unplanned events also able independent distribution pipelines supply chains 

 Similar scenarios already happened small numbers US covered mainstream media. 

 possible scenarios perhaps patients records unavailable inaccessible whatever far flung reason unable identify first dose received. matter hypothetical unlikely point cannot guarantee events happening document about, deciding events. writing document prevent events happening. 

Not contingency plan document means allowable path forward.  Vaccinators position choice leave invidual one dose nothing else currently permitted. (Something manafacturers recommend) know 

Your response usual, disingenous. tried help someone use everbrite today, sold milliseconds. Still better waiting line hours hours. I'd think anybody right mind would've listened people actually know talking about. I'd rather grinch grim reaper. Lol, there's plenty places managed keep economies going throughout pandemic muppet. Guess places done properly effectively? think so. got sitting around? wish many. Dude, clearly Down’s Syndrome, condition different metabolism typical human.

There studies tried claim schools ""safe"" election. We've known kids transmit less since collected data shows young children need school social, emotional, mental health (plus academic advancement course).

How much social interaction people think actually happens schools properly following social distancing also shows get spread less.

Ignoring fact new strain seems affect kids more, average teacher exposed LOT kids daily basis. Even kids get less, ton potential exposure, especially students wear masks ALSO found frequently testing student staff reduces 90% spread.

The amount schools require daily even weekly testing incredibly low. can't ""force"" student take Covid test. can't ""force"" parent get kid tested honestly fill daily democrats demanding providing money needed school open safely, frequent testing, teacher vaccinated.

My democratic state wants schools open now, requirements frequent testing teacher no, It’s thing.

I'm fence origins absolutely correct - information never bad thing. Congrats EU. need scramble buy vaccines. place live, are. places fucking cornfield live on.

No stimulus, furloughed almost year now. Fuck Trump. Fuck you. Fuck whole lie country. Yeah I've heard ""communist Ardern"" going send country broke closing border.

As far making headlines scary/exciting clicks...I totally agree media this, yes. sometimes it’s also laziness misunderstanding writer’s part. china's bats coming home roost, still getting away much though Unless AZ proven “around level” mRNA vaccines don’t see chance approved.

That's approval process works. months ago 95% effective mRNA vaccine would seemed unlikely, going refuse vaccines failing meet high bar. People taking would feel taking second class vaccine.

It's already rolled out. I'm aware anyone refusing basis ""second class"", maybe because, middle pandemic killed millions, vaccine (worst case) 60% preventing infection 100% effective preventing severe infections much better nothing. I’d agree least 2021. We’re going anything absolutely outrageous like fill indoor stadium concert venue soon. think might get back pretty close full normal packing tons people together going still considered risky time come, forever. actually important keep highlighting people's behavior driving size surge. mutation outside control. 

Yep. going end people stop getting together, stop pretending ok eat indoors mask (apparently virus respects lunch time) around bunch strangers, stop flying without good reason, people stop anti-mask shit get vaccinated. don’t qualify, get message. That’s fucking ridiculous. Anyone stay home stay home. realistic America never concerts sports spectators? think also conclusion: season matters anything. reason Eastern Europe seems later onset flu season almost every year. Maybe dodged spring outbreak pattern, hit worse fall. 

NZ real test March-June season respiratory viruses start.

Lesson planning, responding 87 emails day, accommodating IEPs, attending endless meetings, dealing asshole parents... Literally way Newsom vaccinate people aggressively tried put therapeutics vaccines express goal working letting virus spread control, would happened without therapeutics vaccines. different would life right EUAs granted September 2020 vaccination programs started then? know probably never realistic plenty optimistic timelines last year could happen soon? Tbh hate trump bet woulda given -0% vaccine unlike newsom rate California administering Vaccine, pariahs world Coronavirus going us forever. probably need corona vax every year (like flu vax) regular periodicity. developing new/better single dose vaccines still priority Ouch. I'm glad Canada puts transportation provincial jurisdiction. Part reason could orofecal transmission resulting benign intestinal form Covid

I’m Charlotte every restaurant drove packed Friday night. We’ve day past week 9,500 new cases insane wasn’t backlog. Schools opening person signs side road kids sports signups. 

Even veterinary hospitals slammed (I vet tech friends) best specialty/emergency hospital area beyond ICU capacity. tech 7-9 hospitalized patient discharges day pre-covid 12-15 every day. second cage opens it’s filled again. pets see also way sicker since people waiting longer come in, euthanasias anyone ever seen entire career - way way way higher, gets worse month. It’s even crushing euthanasia financial reasons always rips soul - it’s powerless, hopeless feeling it’s hard feel like monster even aren’t one sets prices can’t control economy created situation first place.

The pandemic adds whole new level widespread economic hardship. many, many, many people pet friend, source warmth connection. can’t go get new dog replace relationship took 10 years build old one. Pets irreplaceable completely unique personality never repeated ever again. guilt eats people alive.

Mention military also robust medical unit give soldiers logs vaccines already. Tbh could probably make new vaccine couple days, bulk time testing safe/effective. death rate lower hospitals filled staff stretch thin. NYC early knew help actually helped prevent ration care since sadly patients dying fill space Courageous! /s True leader helm Lol? Tell princess, go party groups 10? state county one strictest lockdowns nation, yet cases surged. Genuinely curious. much New Zealand’s position right fact it’s summer? countries Southern Hemisphere practiced different response, current situation? countries Northern Hemisphere practiced response New Zealand, current situation?

I’m genuinely happy NZ, want use example people okay gathering, want make sure right facts. read article.  least Florida seems making effort get many vaccinated possible, open public plans unlike states distribution cloaked mystery, plans full generalities, 30% available vaccine administered. idea production vaccines Q3 going matter funny. summer end either vaccinated infected killing ourselves.  No, I'm saying everything power make sure people get first people actually need it. Pretty fucking badly Sadly, c55 million Americans 65. shots going healthcare professionals (which number millions) simultaneously (or first), absolutely way reaching Americans 65 two weeks. simply isn’t enough supply that’s consider distribution bottlenecks. Want back sources, chief?

Additionally, absence symptoms mean absence contagiousness. least can't get vaccine straight away looking drugs currently market may help symptoms, Ivermectin. mask mandate?Mask wearing taken srsly wearing helmet riding bicycle here.And let's even mention pipe dream social distancing. ""I'd happy help outside."" seem like troll. Apparently bureaucracy Fucking idiots. whole idea decided people lives completely ruined absurd. disaster. People dying, covid. years-long wave suicides nightmare. sure, wait sure wish! Fuckers. couldn’t wrong. you’re vaccinated won’t get sick symptoms won’t happen. whole point vaccinating.  locking 4 million people compared 350 million massive difference one talking about. logical conclusion point absolutely everywhere. simply aren’t testing everywhere. fact CA administered less 10% vaccines hand criminal, bad anything Trump done, Newsom held accountable deaths due slow rollout Yeah angry headlines like last week (hospital administration receiving vaccines medical staff). heard news receiving vaccine longer care. get people vaccinated. stories like generate outrage backlash auditing need involved administering vaccine it'll take longer. get cutting line, sacrificing accuracy speed think ok trade off. police state folks, everyone best can. Like birds people fly south/west Holidays.

Since articles never mention sources outbreaks probably due 0 contact tracing. starting doubt government say, ""ok over, open up!""

So way goes back, kinda start living life normally quorum vaccinated, deaths hospitalizations go down, etc. could also see coming back mass force public pushed far. really want happen. think anyone :/ thought 4-6 weeks create new vaccine itself, test it. That's good least. Neither say anything April? El Salvador five. Hopefully EU get doses planned. Currently low amounts expected Q4. Chinese man Singapore recovered covid-19 weeks later died blood clots heart. 40s. 

I think people don’t know anyone covid mildly affected can’t bothered it. them, severe covid happens people never them. Yeah, dont like rude internet, that's incredibly stupid question. That's great opinion 3 countries. I'm speaking opinion well, I'm telling person country viewed differently. see comments relation person said Ivy League common view haha. New Zealanders deserve full credit handling pandemic. 
 
However, detract achieved, countries also locked early hard fare well. Argentina great example. article prasing Argentina response - indirectly criticizing neighbour Brazil became poster child respond pandemic. 
  
 
Fast-forward today Brazil actually number cumulative cases, fewer cumulative deaths per capita southern neighbour. 
 
There lot investigations still done find worked didn't, simple saying ""shut everything OK"". one thing lot poorer countries can't shut - people would starve death. yes need something this; disgrace. sadly current reality. 
 
Anyway, congratulations NZ enjoy pubs sports - deserve them. Meanwhile TN 20% positivity, school resumes next week! Tedros re-educated Beijing superior right issuing criticism. sucks, Newsom cares image actually helping right thing. vaccines expire administered rate end Jan Chief medical officer said restrictions possible next winter.

Pfizer board member news today said we're entire post-9/11-style world longer see '1000s crammed room' again.

Welcome Forever New Normal, cheered millions. ""careful"" beaurocrats locked work camp approve vaccine. really see causing others stalling.

This ducking disaster. time take things slow passed many months ago. America, also hope you’re good there! I'm American wife 3 kids. New Zealand resident willing adopt family? I'll try good adoptive son help washing dishes! Nurse mental breakdown fined ""not job""  would know? fair, teachers really rough go it. Little support, overworked, sometimes asked create two separate lesson plans set students. understandable things going way are. really starts top, that's blame be.  gut punch, ugh. Unfortunately scientists listened to. hell freezers keep breaking? freezer running nonstop decade never issue... comment crowding 1,000s people room doesn’t exactly illicit much confidence normal life (concerts/sports etc). hope he’s wrong that. Yep. current European laws many places results World War II experiences, put place make sure say thank people end concentration camps. reason war drugs failed reason CA covid strategy failed. crash wall going 80, I’ll die anyway, might well wear seatbelt. Merci bien! Seriously! older folks America REMOVED reality. 600 dollars isn’t SHIT. honestly, take anything worked stiffness fine. thats illegal sorry :/ Read numbers repeat statement. Germany excess vaccines right now. Even holding doses back, number *do not* add scheduled Biontech supply (we using 280k doses per week get 650k). sitting several hundreds thousands doses right now. Yes. Nice! get vaccine already? EMT, couple things I’ve seen past couple months nearly broken me.

Powerlessness sucks, watching people die shouldn’t, wealth training isn’t helping all—that really hits hard.

Imagine knowing someone side door possibly infected longer breathing, dead 1-2 minutes...and knowing takes 4-5 get scene, get PPE get door. Getting home knowing rush right now, may stop brain dead. knowing do, you’ll exposed Covid, might infect dozens end getting it. furthermore knowing local health dept said work symptomatic, aren’t enough people without virus fill EMS shifts.

So stand tears eyes, donning PPE fast can, knowing it’s nearly fast enough. Knowing correct decision painful one. call coroner minutes later person could saved, virus existed.

This call average Tuesday. I’m normally able cope. days worse others. couldn’t imagine watching entire ward die something simple lack oxygen, can’t say wouldn’t react similar way. least I’m sure I’d break soon got home could process day. think part problem CA priority plan itself. way complex. There's phases, sub phases, tiers within sub phases, disaster. actual people dying mostly 65yr+. move entire population right today. CA 1.5m doses sitting freezers. We're trying figure newsom's plan life saving doses just.... sitting there. unbelievable me. 3900 ppl died US last 24 hours, let's sit doses figure goddamn priority plan. I’d go 10% assets, foreign domestic. said anything caring dad dies? 

Why dramatic? Taiwan spewing anti China propaganda per usual, nothing see move along. data Moderna clearly better efficacy data quality. 

Moderna need match multiple trials together, Moderna screw dosing. point vaccines. point vaccine eradicate disease, keep manageable. carriers disease, problem means disease mutate become deadly transmissible. Allowing portion population walking around COVID spreading people unknowingly allowing mutate unacceptable. Yes, making sure vulnerable populations medical professionals vaccinated really important getting everyone else get COVID shots also super super important really path eradicating COVID. we, society, take non-COVID vaccine complaint people deny access public transportation public entertainment venues, need do. matter health, rights.

If individual rights public health, let tell COVID19 appetizer Shit Storm Buffet served couple years unless get COVID infection numbers really really low. saw Santa Christmas. know explaining? RemindMe! 4 weeks 'Bot Reminder' would assume that? Haven’t learned coronavirus didn’t limit Wuhan? World travel still occurring, strain already found 20+ countries, rapid spread, etc... done here. English-language news sources often forget countries sovereign nations entitled enforce laws. made up. LOL give dude, like told before, want taken seriously clean posting history. posts r/China_flu calling genocide Chinese people bad look mmk? like now? months back actually happened? people get sick. - people get hospitalized. - people die non-COVID causes due hospitals overwhelmed. - finally, people die COVID. - vaccinated

This thing NEVER end lockdowns. way thru vaccination, long new strains remain vulnerable fine soon.  long 80 year olds get vaccinated shit nothing required terms passport someone tested positive tested 14 days? read, it’s implied it’s necessary. However, I’m sure that. What’s consensus that? I'm trying say going downfall civilization. huge impact world many years come imagine, literal end world. AZ, data support (for vaccine obvs)

IMO stick manufacturer guidelines. Give pfizer/moderna ones time, give AZ one longer delays.

What's hard that? Bars open!? ibuprofen help ? $70 per person vaccine developed record time end global pandemic mass deaths? They’ve earned every penny people keep pretending binary outcome people suffering long-term effects COVID? die mean lasting symptoms effects. Sorry hear that. seems really hard get proper diagnosis many specialists about. got diagnosed Hypermobility years ago every symptom Ehlers Danlos actual diagnosis that. spectrum cause digestive issues, hope get proper diagnosis! AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine. Modern vaccine approved US Canada EU knowledge. Probably waiting see BJ u turn. could be...but won’t be. San Diego 32 cases, definitely lot 8 whole least it'll create jobs fake vaccine passport market. Oddly enough vaccinated Sinopharm's vaccine last former Shanghai CDC immunologist medical professional, Tao Lina, said received first dose Beijing Institute’s vaccine Saturday emergency use program.  said “absolutely adverse reactions, even localized reaction.”

He seems quite happy vaccine. Odd would read side effects warning leaflet month vaccination change mind?

Are sure accurate Ahh makes sense, see California... No, mean would hard US EU. Finland isolated part EU, Finnish user might realise hard would Everybody knows China allow investigate Covid's origins...Stop pretending. loud clear. started China know know it. Ah Fuck no, bud nice see something good come Rather dampen turnout engender hard feelings, watching stream Jewish people arriving towns shots actually helped create vaccine-bolstering buzz lacking Arab community, locals said. considered utterly scared pessimistic reddit is? need calculate in. [Here's study question results, generally consider multiplier-type studies necessary sufficient first step answering research question. 

This one, credit, uses relatively large sample size compared still thousand total population 360 million geographic areas. disparities positives/negatives swing millions multiplied across entire population. 

I'm besmirching results, saying need validated additional research approaches could considered authoritative. Assuming uk's population size america would 5,126 deaths. unfortunately get least 1500 per day think, time lag Christmas/new year. Hardly anyone socially distances avoids mixing people large groups, least live. people seem 80s 90s. really seeing controversy here. getting anyway. Nah I'm good without anyone know long vaccine effective for? even possible vaccinate 700 people course one week assume? single nurse probably administer 700 vaccines week. Yeah lets face US fucked lot levels directly related population tutorial level failed LOL. know anything parameters new strain? 

Like, used paranoid making quick masked grocery trips getting passed unmaksed runner based think understood Covid transmission.

Do know things still generally low risk new strain? Everything open. They've shut practically non-essential indoor businesses. Retailers still operate reduced hours limited occupancy. well let's say, Israel? “Rationing” isn’t right word socialized medicine. 

Frankly, everyone get care, implement socialized medicine, needs restrictions care. 

No useless procedures old people give 1/1000000 shot living. 

It’s wasteful inefficient. two months ago. Makes want move NZ. Covid - bad - warmup H5N1 (avian flu) inevitably happen point (hopefully lifetimes). received first dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Dec. 18 tested negative COVID-19 recently New Year's Day. Brady, House floor week interacted fellow members, said would ""begin treatment"" Wednesday.

He tested positive 2 weeks receiving 1st injection. taken 2nd shot, experience mild symptoms.

He may get VIP treatment get access monoclonal antibodies. otherwise becomes common accepted.

It accepted going vote for, one lying pricks?

The main difference democracy dictatorship choose dictator prefer. Nobody says vaccinated. Everybody get shot priority.  Meanwhile, district suburb Houston already making plans offer remote learning entire next school year. Crazy handled differently handful miles away. Glad see prioritizing certain groups support economy America's safety. Pfizer vaccine, sore arms shots, minor headache fatigue similar slightly hungover day second booster, went away next day. Well live state. Crime rise year: 
 
- Lockdowns led increased domestic violence calls in-home crime (D/V, assaults, murder, etc) 
- Civil rights protests led looters/rioters taking advantage them. Malls boarded preparation protests dark protest crowd would head home, looters would come looking score. Thanks Jake Paul participating, ya dingus. 
- Theft sky-high year. usually bad cities even pre-covid, contributing factors led vehicle break ins, home burglaries, robbery, etc. 
 
In short, right high stress people losing jobs, income, homes, family disease, etc. leading massive spike crime. 
 
Now I'm detective, good 'ol boy working gun counter living, get lot word street that's way things seem shifting right now. Gun sales unprecedented right pandemic stress losses crime destabilization happening nationwide scaring shit people. OK.

What information spreading among social circle? (hint: haven't)

I got contacted friend afternoon (see comment below) thought it'd good idea come find there's research/info new variant reinfections. 

I came looking information instead I'm getting told I'm lying 😂😂😂 can't contract virus unless specifically get tested it.

(FYI I'm ex-biologist sisters doctor covid ward london) good mask on. wear. feel good isn’t regards Covid Covid vaccines, unclear thread. That’s month old, still good point. looking total cases new cases. probably makes sense look new cases. already certain vaccines travel areas world. makes sense travel least.

I think anyone else going it. Travel? Yeah, fairly likely. nobody gives shit ur fuckall award   Number potential side effects meaningless. rate serious side effects important. 

If one vaccine causes 10% people hospitalized one condition better another vaccine causes 2% people hospitalized 100 conditions. best spread special brand sarcastic cynicism around world. don’t think anyone admins arguing morally hospital admins getting vaccine prior risk people. Logistically it’s easier vaccinate people work hospital bc that’s vaccines currently given opposed bussing wheeling people nursing homes 2nd floor vaccine clinics. Eventually vaccine brought around nursing homes different complicated vaccination model US currently relying mass vaccinations. think US government currently relying health care systems administer vaccine, hiring mobile vaccination units phase 2 clearly aren’t prepared yet struggling phase 1.

The difference keeping hospital black vs private company community suffer tremendously hospital shutting pandemic rather restaurant department store. easy ""thought"" priority groups working vaccines unused. Permanent lockdowns coming, rational person see it. good news Psychology teaches us first 20 years hard, gets easier. literally true human way honest, world born privilege achieved grown believe deserve first important rest.... exceptions course.... Actually known lethal. Whether less lethal remains seen. am, Upstate NY, think finally hitting big numbers. never really got first wave back March. government shut everything down, never hit part, people resumed normal life May.  


Now starting spread hit, looking pretty bad. Everyone blaming new strain. No, first strain never hit Vietnam counter argument. 90mil+ pop densely populated boot. saying vaccinate people instead sitting doses waiting perfect opportunity. Highly unlikely even baby would probably fine. low risk group answer get non-scientific reddit sub really going use here?

Why need non-experts vaccine denialists access raw data accept actual experts' conclusions? ... vaccinated people already antibodies fight virus. Likely never get infected virus gaining ground body. there’s presymptomatic phase.

Which whole point getting vaccinated. 'Chinese' covid 19 strain found countries No, veto proof 64 votes, stop fillbuster 60 votes Ummm third world countries? They're getting later year next year. mention bulk shipments donations wealthy countries finish vaccinating everyone. Like Canada ordered 400 million vaccines even though population 38 million. No. means sacrificing others something nothing can't framed purely mathematical matter.

It's appearances, considering others numbers played will. Countries messed whole thing right ask others sacrifice anything first place.  guess wont help getting done, millions vaccines sitting freezers. Well actually decent genomic sequencing know you?  Brexit effect.

Lol

It stupid, announced tier 4 restrictions London, everyone crammed onto trains motorways left London.

When asked TV people planning that, said shouldn't. even attempt control people doing.


I know multiple people left London before, tier 4 restrictions, country one stopped. Hardly surprising spread nationwide far doesn't. them, enough time past 100% confident. 

This virus around little year. immunity last 10 years, would impossible know another 9ish years.

I'd also say immunity black white.

Studies suggest overwhelming majority people signs immunity least 7+ months infection. Immunity likely much longer average, enough time 100% sure. 

For vaccine, phase 3 trials started 5 months ago, latest update around 2-3 months infection bare minimum 2-3 months. Though expectation much longer, Pfizer said expect year minimum, potential much longer. yup - can't fire 100. need page unions work.  one saying get vaccine. saying get vaccine *before* citizens. New Zealand definitely handled well, especially compared US, also helps they're small island nation. Anyway, I'm happy wish results rest world. Well LA DE FRICKIN DAH

(No I’m jealous anything... I’ll dry tears muh freedoms...) 😭😭

At least there’s hope humanity. actually gotten vaccine people's arms quicker. setting records here. served purpose. again, hot air  union needs back. collective bargaining works everyone bought in. shame 60% chicago teachers show solidarity. issue absolutely prioritization, millions vaccines waiting used bevause right people available get them. instead used protect people nothing. Sorry 60 votes Also wet markets exist many countries, millions people exposed long periods time centuries. viruses could change rapidly create strains infect newly again, would already happened common cold created hundreds mutated deadly transmissible variants capable wiping us long ago. That's either big rock, bouncy one!  It’s called setting narrative normalizing it. population sees starts normalizing it. actual thing rolled out, one bats eye. 🤷🏼‍♂️ still Christmas deaths arrive. dems need 50 plus veep vote that. creates low stability future still passes issue isn’t purely statistics one.

So agree statement believe avoiding appearance ethical impropriety important lives could saved actually checking instead assuming.

That’s wanted know, thanks comes long term damage illness thing rely anecdotes, surveys, preliminary research, speculation. Obviously, chances severe disease mortality heavily dependent age health condition. 

Long Covid is, opinion, clearly real occurrence based many clinics opening treat patients complaining it. However, it’s well understood experience chronic illness indicator might never well understood. love one , non peer reviews study gets tons upvotes. Multiple studies show immunity past 6 months without vaccine get downvotes. can't wish want , reality is, adapt dont. friends LAFD saying many people make difference Teachers unionized exact precautions taking - wear mask distance can, inside long there's lot people there. Bloomberg update: [5.2 million  
They seem updating 2 3 times day now. Well, sure. plan ahead regardless. Reddit also anonymous downvote button. true crazies FB friends list amplification tamped significantely feature we're introduced. Nobody wants see vegetables cure cancer videos. They’ve saying “at point it’s impossible eradicate Covid” since March, saying “whoops acted diligently actually COULD eradicated X point time”. live LA. Yesterday took dog walk saw playground 20-30 kids 15-20 families. one wearing mask kids top other.

I'd say let people get sick point. else do? citizens obviously give shit. remember Jacinda telling us, host family members social distancing. Exactly. 2 main competitors west approved. dont like prices buy guys  movie theaters hardly worry ticket sometimes I'm gonna go limb say there's point us conversing.

Unless course info/research new variant reinfections? Possible any, even something not.

Thanks help. tHirD wAvE Winter 2021! one even follows would take enforce quarantine US people many guns. essentially deploy army shoot people sight congregate illegally, least places like Texas. Remember BLM protests? many people would shot sight terminate them?

The US would turn full blown dictatorship 18 months truly stop virus. Yes, people vaccinated, close normal. seemed based conversation thread talking point time risk groups vaccinated. That's I'm saying want life back I'll take risk. mean, kidding right?

You need two shots 3-4 weeks apart get immunity probably takes week two minimum last shot. 6 weeks definitely need wear mask.

After little debatable. almost like socialize costs, privatize profits? important teachers go work?

PLENTY people going work.  work department store either unboxing/sorting /hanging /putting stock, else cashier/tidying sales floor.

*I * coming since late may nonessential retail reopened.  daughter working person restaurants.  Millions people too!

Why teachers need home? 

I mentioned plenty people GOING WORK thread somewhere Chicago teachers got tons votes explanation difference is.

I see it. raining asshats what? People died? thought like 20 people US even took daraprim. I'm pretty sure using daraprim killed people 50s 60s anybody died using today. (Is zero, can't find anyone died getting it) affect him, personally. think would spending many extra hours person. want get sick want GOP getting sick either something little enticing. 2 months rent mortgage would appear missing question mark then. Glad Newsom seem going way Cuomo, imposing fines punishing hospitals giving things order order save doses wasted.

Still super slow rollout tho. Shots arms. need shots arms. necessarily. infections need boosters every then, like tetanus. Others need adjusted regular basis, like influenza (which, fwiw, mutates faster much different way coronaviruses). 

Immunity also off/on switch. people don’t form great immunity viruses, whatever reason. people get sick second time, no/mild symptoms, since body partially reacting. 

There lot concern early on, since antibodies seemed drop quickly SARS-CoV-2. also fact common cold coronaviruses documented cause reinfection 6 month-1 year timeframe. That’s studies important - along low number confirmed/suspected reinfections, mean won’t re-vaccinate every months. Hawaii would've fine allowed shutdown flights like New Zealand did. one 18 months. One answer start vaccinating first 3-4 groups simultaneously forget restrictions go faster.

Another answer really going sure vaccine scarcity. convince think places going either stockpile enough vaccine sure certain enough future deliveries let go reins.

It's like people hoarding toilet paper. fear shortage fear subsides people forget it. I'm related 20 people :( Fauci great track record wrong, I’ll believe see hard take vacation? you’re public figure trying recommend model smart choices people name public health ever year simplify life it. number holidays people gathered recommendations short succession. Labor day, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years people breaking rules spreading exponentially makes feel better live student flat 4 others, one us tested positive quarantine 14 days - NONE us got symptoms whatsoever.

Also flatmate's sister tested positive contact Christmas isolate - still none us got symptoms.

Point is, contact mean guaranteed infected. wait. 2020 started normally it’s appearing likely end 2021 old normal fair bit time. That’s much time lost pandemic grand scheme things. Even personally don’t care risk symptoms, care hospitals struggling can’t give injuries illnesses attention used able give patients Covid clogging system.  knock 15% military budget use pay universal healthcare

problem solved shouldve known lol Teachers probably worse retail. 30 kids classroom ventilation hours time. high school level 30 kids classroom ventilation 40 minutes, another group 40, another... 150 kids sharing air every day. district virtual year. they're still sports clubs. football team cluster. administrators working building cluster. indoor track team cluster. **They're outbreaks 99% people even there!!!""** whole reason we're scared coronavirus specifically deadly single strain flu?

No; coronavirus type influenza. Coronaviruses influenza viruses different viruses. supposed last... know, forever? point getting fucking vaccine?

Many vaccines require boosters. Read this: [You May Immune Forever - Boosters Yes does. speaks favor half-dosing Moderna, [first doses speaks favor everything speed vaccination process. Recently (November), went emergency hospital choice possible fracture looked at. hospital last place wanted COVID-19.

After evaluation nurse doctor, x-rays, confirmation fracture, receiving treatment, got car drive home glanced clock noticing less 2 hours elapsed.

Not bad despite COVID-19 conditions precautions.

I even get asked health insurance info. NZ made winter flu season basically zero flu year totally contained Covid second wave mid winter poorest densely populated area country. 

Seasons make difference Covid present all, thus elimination approach. stop cases border, winter risk. let ""businessmen"" run country normally. Whoops read wrong. like 60% cases UK big deal made it. 

Again, source results? link says nothing results. Everywhere. Hey know 20 people. Funny part 4 changed minds got COVID-19. One even COVID-19 evangelist spending 4 days hospital. different strain UK one? remember hearing community spread already ongoing Here's quote actual agency question FDA: EMA set minimum level efficacy approval. looks overall balance safety efficacy vaccine individually concluding whether approve example, 'vaccine A' could lower efficacy 'vaccine B'. However, vaccine could advantages, as:

  fewer side effects;

 easy storage delivery;

 better results specific age group type spite this, medicine developers design studies demonstrate rate efficacy least blocked? submitted review yet US trial finished Yeah indeed interesting see years much COVID mutates it’s control. Maybe speed first vaccines developed means we’ll well posed stay top mutations alterations vaccines (and plus vaccines play right seem work variants maybe mutations non issue.) 

I’m skeptical pull camp sure would nice see fully eradicated!  think lot reasons optimism media refuses publish anything remotely positive.

Many areas vaccinating 3-4% population going ramp quickly. need vaccinate everyone make big difference. 80% fatalities occur 15% population. vaccinate ""right"" 15% think things change quickly. 3x seems low considering hard get test first half year number individuals might asymptomatic won’t test even sick. look total deaths, seems plausible 30-40% country infected. commenter exaggerating, point pretty good postiion vaccines. Now, vaccination lagging projections, rate spread *might* increasing. lot people watching data variant anxiously. isn’t common knowledge patients?

Because backed studies all, it’s anecdotal, I’ve talked people actually sounds like interesting concept. hate afford would using could afford honestly.

However, another thing take away fact service exists medical system use big giant overhaul. one said anything silver bullet 100% cure.


Well, people keep claiming going disappear Easter, spring, summer, election day, etc...


Man guys issues. everything containment management COVID. actual lockdown, order effective, requires data-driven analysis contact tracing every COVID case hotspots. Sweden lockdown countries fared poorly able log cases track isolate prevent transmission time, purpose lockdown. Therefore, secondary purpose lockdowns became mitigate overwhelming hospitals. They're exposed higher numbers sick people compared rest population. say higher priority elderly people I'd say they're level priority, since providing care sick. didn’t originate U.K. yes. Pfizer Moderna vaccines 2 dose vaccines. first dose provides ~50% chance never getting symptomatic case Covid (I'm pulling 50% number memory, someone correct I'm wrong). 2nd dose provides 95% chance never getting symptomatic case Covid. Everyone gets 1st dose offered 2nd dose. need vaccinate everybody. US probably needs 50% vaccinated provide herd immunity since 0.5 x 0.7 + 0.3 = 0.65. Actually would expect deaths drop lower numbers given targeted. Community transmission might even drop, although new strains might counter that. still hold Q2 several badly affected countries return mostly normal. We’ll see, you’re looking current generation humans. grandkids affected weakened state generations, better due it. Along that, people die lower population - helping planet well. 501.V2 carries mutation spike protein called E484K, present UK strain, Francois Balloux, director University College London Genetics Institute, says statement. “**The E484K mutation shown reduce antibody recognition,**” says, *which may help virus bypass immune protection provided prior infection vaccination*.

It seems 501.V2 soon fairly ubiquitous. think need wear masks, work home (where possible) &amp; socially distance next 5 years. Coronavirus earnt respect wise. He, anyone else believes god, acted religious beliefs, he's perfectly fine legal Here's latest case/death charts Georgia, running 7-day bad places. We'll see changes.

Overall state 100.92 deaths per 100k population. That's slightly national average.

Georgia ranks 22nd among US states per capita makes sense me, too. I'd love read original, assuming understand it. Short answer. Money. Long answer. Money. makes sense, guess kind gotten hand Europe. serious attempt contact tracing made summer Europe numbers low? Right now, 5,000,000 Americans [have received first seems like Slaoui shipped 20,000,000 doses planned getting arms within first week January, sadly injections seem gone quickly shipments. Hopefully federal local governments work together fix quickly logistically possible.

I think Slaoui's goal vaccinating 100,000,000 people March becomes much less likely every day ship vaccines inject, hopefully daily shots continue rise exponentially we're point 2,000,000 even 3,000,000 doses given every day. teachers medical workers. sure would think that. ever attend school USA? unchartered waters. Past pandemics mass global localized travel today. much today sources spreading events.

Whole new game. Whole new world. push reopening schools besides $$$?

Based population UK actually **more** deaths USA. Turns keeping schools open truly shit idea, NHS starved funds collapsed. tangible end. vaccine.  makes whole lot sense. sure. Really proud glad got things done fast. brought cases lot too. fault Sweden using Taiwan strategy? Taiwan could taken steps lockdown internally mitigating COVID, Sweden could done same, nothing locking down. South Korea also lock internally death rate nowhere near Sweden's, goes Iceland Finland.

If no-lockdown countries problems Sweden, maybe weak link Sweden's strategy lack lockdown. Spouse teacher here: Apparently can't say area I'm get removed.

Here's latest case/death charts Harris county, running 7-day county 73.40 deaths per 100k, quite bit less US per capita average.

Minks brilliant animals many escape every year. 4/5 wild minks Denmark born mink farms (they tell analyzing teeth - wild mink eat freshwater fish farmed mink eat ocean fish).

Take one step forward - let’s look wet market Peru Amazon rainforest. one shut literally every single stall operator tested positive. positive people jam packed ear ear tons humans every animal species get hands on. market animals escape released contracted covid, potentially create new reservoir species. We’ve learned species vulnerable. virus mutates every species jump since adapt new host.

This isn’t Russian roulette mutations - mental image I’m getting thousand bouncy balls dropped flight stairs it’s pure chaos. doesn’t matter 99.9% resulting mutations harmless - 0.1% takes create covid20/21/+. 

The sheer number infections species jumps occurring mean virus out-evolve attempts suppression, again. Sure, vaccine makers may need tweak formula less 2 months, front row seat difficult global distribution truly is. 

I don’t care call doomer downvote I’m saying directly confronts unhealthy denial coping mechanism. info will, I’m beyond caring writing wall. human population reached 1 million approximately 3,000 years ago. Around 1800 reached 1 billion people. mere 200 years later we’ve hit 7.7 billion. That’s hyper exponential growth rate that’s essentially straight line graph. Covid nature imposing checks balances. We’ve negatively impacted nearly every single species ecosystem planet. essentially divine retribution disrespect towards life insatiable greed - especially billionaires. That’s folks. permanent wildlife reservoir means game over, already multiple countries. said take “a full year” vaccinate everybody city

You remember governors mayors speaking hyperbole comes getting government aid. easy read hear sound alarm, 1) true - *can* take year vaccinate *everyone*, especially count nervous vaccine. 2) According Philly's current rollout, things going very, slow. course mayor gonna say get attention. 3) rolling slow place, ramping up.

People wonder US couldn’t New Zealand did. Probably US ~65x amount people. 

NZ similar population state Minnesota size (per square mile).

It’s lot easier manage 5 million people manage 330 million. don’t think anyone crazies saying vaccine rapidly kill cause great health problems immediately.

The legitimate concern long term effects (5 10 years) Latest info spread vaccinated infected unlikely. evidence people vaccinated spread virus. r/everyfuckingthread

*""But think majority people test positive antibodies protected time."" good there's probably people coming back death. It'd hard anything contagious that. - death worse go living, suffering life long disability pure living hell Yeah, people won’t get paranoid this. Yes. That's viral means  New York got slammed almost zero testing capabilities. numbers likely triple reported Reporting done state governments Modi..lol Personally, I’m wanting ahead flip get COVID vaccine. Isn’t everyone? Several European countries reach zero cases spring

It's done reaching zero, make effort keep there. seen European country trying that, quite opposite, opened back fast could, much could delayed second lock long stay lockdown forever?

You lock uncontained community transmission, open don't. 

How exactly letting virus spike 40'000 cases day helping anybody? Italy back lockdown right now. could locked back August cases started rising sitting 300.

Waiting around accomplish anything. Trying avoid lockdowns avoid lockdowns, means end harder longer things completely control again. Yeah. Realistically probably need maybe 200m vaccinations see drastic changes cases. looking lifetime ban either, bad time clear deferral option (federal summons)

All times I've state jury duty trial, waiting game call 5PM X day see need you.(repeat again) also found strange mention vaccines. lot things would go horribly wrong order majority population Europe North America vaccinated end 2021. schools shitty job remote learners

While bad, people dying covid much worst. choice shitty semester people dying covid, choice simple. lol, people don’t real ID. have. Hi, I’m working grant state health department tracking COVID healthcare workers. One main reasons HCWs refusing vaccine many feel like guinea pigs population... simply want first section GP receive quickly developed vaccine (even clinical trials) usually rationale feel comfortable possibility long term side effects (even mostly debunked). However, many say willing take line. “Come back”

Implies it’s leaving...

Look, vaccines work, work. virus may never leave. might eventually become little cold-like nuisance though. Brazil huge territory extends large portion southern hemisphere ... covering latitudes 5°16'20"" N 33°44'32"" . COVID19 cases surging across whole country, even southern regions. know anything how/if virus spreads via people vaccinated? 7 month old obviously very, isolated. many family members, grandparents, friends able meet hold kid, taxing. mention able usual amount family support life infant. 

Anyways, obviously want able safely see family members, plan getting vaccinated. However, kid currently can't since young. even get vaccinated might still safe around family virus still spread vaccinated people daughter... People need money, that’s showed up. 1. expert thinks South African strain invalidates vaccine. think *may* decrease efficacy *slightly.*

I'm far emotional guy, definitely compose bit asking wife wanted see it. Leaving essentials work food fine. 
If job allows work home, exercise right. 
But leaving stupid, unnecessary shit dumb. wearing mask properly dumb. 
Not taking necessary precautions come back home dumb. 

Why go damn super market every damn day, buy whole week. Plan gonna cook eat. 

But nooooo, let’s bring whole dang family store treat like field trip. 

Let go work, wear mask properly, wash hands, touch face, lunch coworkers close them, 6 feet apart come inside house shoes on, hug everybody touch everything

Sure, let’s that. Oh don’t forget dumb visits people living household cuz either pool, bbq, stupid sports game. 

Also go walk without wearing damn mask. Let’s that. 

And finally rude dang workers stores cuz worry others asking lazy ass wear damn mask properly. 

Nobody cares somebody household dies it. Probably true too. don’t even like bringing personal business Reddit entire family reinfected 6 months apart wife went hospital times severe first. article tells that’s impossible I’m wrong 😉 F. likely post Thanksgiving surge given seemed take 6-8 weeks predicted death surges super-spreader events materialize data. headline gives image detached head sitting table saying random stuff... Folder labeled FDA lying table also. Yes, potential good news post according Fauci OP's good news appear (…) making people sick leading death. … thing important favorable thing, seem evade protection that’s afforded vaccines currently used. Spoiler alert: wont.

I worked weekend burbs DFW treating ER patients hallways waiting rooms. Rooms open floors, filling patients unless critical, ICU full 12/18 beds ICU COVID pt's. case Dec. Also staff beginning either quit transfer administration done nothing advocate employees, staff getting trouble mistakes due pt load fatigue, blamed mistakes (As customary healthcare industry instead actually addressing issues, find someone blame wash hands matter).

It already slowly started, see mass exodus (already massively understaffed) healthcare industry soon. new strain lethal? Alright, I’m good news best practices think I’ve heard enough New Zealand now. actually roll vaccines first. Take virtual award Educational video breaks do, don't, know new covid variant: No, death definitely worst, permanently disabled bad too. saying accurately know many vaccinations done point right now? test-based strategy requires negative results using RT-PCR detection SARS-CoV-2 RNA FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) COVID-19 least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total two negative specimens)."" would make ask question like here? forgot tag /u/delicateanalflower he(?) might learn think understand, downvoting anything optimistic. personally know 19 year old reinfected approximately 4 months apart. think great hopefully majority immune time, others personal experience know not. something definitely hadn’t thought could totally see reason! Thanks input. helps put whole thing perspective people. 400,000 really big number hard contemplate. Comparing deaths WW2 sure put perspective... people. people don’t care. Hahaha, know feeling. I've situation someone claiming ""masks filter 20% air, rest passes by"" single source would spam ever relevant post country's subreddit lol

I figured also arguments stopped responding soon really went detail arguments. Plus ""lets make arguments seem ridiculous changing subject"". Oh well, actually interested learning something new even like presented point view. 

Thanks lot details, wondering news US Europe could contrary seems that's even case. Good know. taught summer camp early 20s; kids passed around kind summer bug couple weeks fine; cold symptoms got it. caught bronchitis lingered chest almost year quit working briefly able recover. would want adult school right now. me, US case number way low today? live, Texas, huge surge summer. I’m Texas. We’ve person since September. Understood- yes agree you, high level bidirectional adherance medical masks prevent onward spread effectively. Thank you! That's DMV summer sucked worked thing surprise anyone haven’t heard sooner. I’d venture guess hospitals wealthy donors, execs board members sufficient data show 90% second shot. misrepresenting thr data. fabric you’re seeing (if that’s Taiwan)is probably cloth mask covers sometimes use. bat probably eaten day  figure them. I'm listening rather believing want spite evidence reality scary.

I'm impression respect Fauci's opinion.

**White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday unlikely coronavirus ever eradicated.** 

**While virus disappear, it’s possible world leaders public health officials could work bring virus “low levels,” director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases said interview TB Alliance.**

**“I think combination good public health measures, degree global herd immunity good vaccine, hope feel cautiously optimistic get, think put three together, get control this, whether it’s year next year. I’m certain,” said.**

**But, added, “I don’t really see us eradicating article started discussion quotes number experts warning entering new, ""perilous"" phase pandemic.

I'm sure much evidence want cite. can't make see experts plainly warning us future virus. interact social media can't comment reading there, anything like content caused dissociate understand confusion. submit totalitarian government guys nothing contain pandemic.

They actively CAUSED get worse. nursing homes, mask comments, Pelosi Dems telling people ""come down"" china town making fun government shutting borders... Oh tire Stupid packers fan insult? guess get lot. i'd fucking hope so! bare minimum stuff. never russians basically, UK taking semi-calculated risk. benefits getting less immunity people greater benefits getting immunity fewer people? latter better protect vaccinated, former might slow spread faster.

It's usual different opinions philosophy science important consequences dire, almost real time situations.

The first school thought flexible: Based know general immunology experience vaccines, relatively good ground apply general knowledge here, breadth-first vaccination approach save lives.

The second school rigid: protocol 2 vaccine shots 3 weeks empirically studied, protocol empirically know works. consider protocols, empirical evidence know might work. :D

Dude, remake Enemy Gates theme! challenge is: going replace people training new staff? Particularly you’re already contingency status staffing? Additionally, new staff going compliance federal stare healthcare rules? money onboarding, wages, benefits coming from? fast get background checks turned around? going manage people? afford institutional risk?

It’s matter getting butts seats calling day. There’s million one things go issues.  live Dallas area, winter break still high school volleyball games sports. Texas schools handled horribly. already hear coworkers talking cant wait kids go back school. mess.

Conversely ER consultation day scheduled surgery patient transferred inpatient beds. boss (also physician) got back Turks Caicos vacation family.

What crazy dichotomy. There’s deadly virus loose, tanked global economy. would go back work? Getting PS5 easier. Hahaha, know feeling. I've situation someone claiming ""masks filter 20% air, rest passes by"" single source would spam ever relevant post country's subreddit lol

trust know mean there. wasted 2 hours + trying explain someone insistent virus particles'
 smaller masks (including n95's) 'holes' therefore masks would entirely useless. professor, degree. exhausting people often vocal sharing figured also arguments stopped responding soon really went detail arguments. Plus ""lets make arguments seem ridiculous changing subject"". 

A tried tested technique always Thanks lot details, wondering news US Europe could contrary seems that's even case. Good know.

You're welcome. way here's (fair ) coverage 'mix Match' trials, US experts aware jumping righteous indignation (despite they've pipelined months) wanted read also AZ: Sputnik mix trials planned, seperate study. useful research world matter uncharitably framed pretty stupid take, ok. 

One politician's opinion possibly represent ""american people"". vaccinate according risk groups. incident probably vaccinated anyone everyone requested use spoil. They're dividing number survivors total population instead total number resolved cases. fun! Stay safe. Use duolingo free brush French! Good quarantine project. Moderna vaccine 18 hrs ago. Arm barely sore side effects 15 hours after, suddenly really tired. Left work 3pm. worried arm pain would worse talk. Let’s see long takes fatigue go away world war taking place. People moving, perhaps speed today, moved certainly gathered aka spreading events. Lol same. I'm probably going cry if/when gets EUA. predictions estimated timeline happening US cities similar size population density? something unique LA facilitating this? That, worry office bosses coming floor area asking stupid questions interupting work. first reply may find pandemic truly cleared China. Depends broke. Sometimes fan cooling compressors, that's hundred (yes, big version pc case fan... Science stupid expensive reason). Compressors going costs multi thousands. New freezer 10k though, there's decent competition market. even November telling people mask unnecessary meetings conference room. work state vovernment. scary. Top work!! Keep up. need people like Vaccinating speed worry. spring things much better place full normal, can't see able start hanging friends low risk. plenty fun outdoor activities again.

I'm hoping outdoor festivals brought back year. definitely help through. winter awful far outdoor activities. Israel seems like could good case study many X number people die/contract covid X number days X% people vaccinated. could interesting. 

They're apparently going back lockdown tho???? Makes feel like never end. Even vaccination widely distributed, end. terrifies since I'm California. good day. Yesterday felt ok today I'm back crazy depressed. Smh. One mom’s complaints sister’s kids little direct access contact teachers. expecting streaming live classroom instruction, rarely happened. recall petition going around Gavin Newsom (the Governor California). far it’s unsuccessful, doesn’t really political capital close non essential retail way back March. Especially getting caught flouting rules going fancy restaurant lobbyists. 

Unfortunately far many people care “rights” don’t worry responsibilities fellow human beings. course doesn’t help next financial help federal government.  think MSM would push fear narrative they? real entire subreddit would investigation.. virus virtually everyone level immunity. people infected less people able infected future. 

Also decent amount belief winter particularly dangerous type viruses. People congregate indoors, (potentially low vitamin levels winter) appears virus stays air longer cold air. 

So natural immunity seasonal changes would expect less cases spring now. don’t know long term effects. people think it’s overreaction find infection causes infertility heart damage could mean lives shortened average 10 years? large proportion Americans poverty right anything $500, even believe shot give 5G-related cancers. Look, fucked up, gotta something. going get around round stimulus anyway, conditioning $500 shot going put financial burden country already have.  Places wish lived : New Zealand &amp; Taiwan  Maybe guess we'll never know... 🤷‍♂️ “Indians” that. There's lack regard social distancing guidelines. Even surge, we're hearing things like large Christmas church services California. That's recipe disaster. 

It's actually important keep highlighting people's behavior driving size surge. mutation outside control. mutation might make worse, that's top people lax surge could smaller. thought reading article, US 'health system' often makes think, 'Gee, almost like health care *shouldn't* for-profit business scheme!'. seeing 6 months. sure wait till Dec seen.
They rush CT scans tests etc. Yeah, cause suspicious anything! mods already took post apparently skip? think hygiene theatre may provide mental health benefits people too.. let feel sort control..

.. people think control makes safe, catch covid wear mask. ""All vets died COVID, y'all anti-mask pro-america folks care now?""

""It probably COVID caused deaths!""

""Okay well change fact dead vets? even care vets???""

Is I'd imagine multiple conversations go down. allowed work first one work home, lots businesses chose shut due childcare health concerns. they're staying open stay business.   Well here, like rest world, look USA mixture pity disgust go ahead 'not fan"" little heart content enjoy 500k deaths Yeah weird. wonder actually allergic kind antibiotic cleaning agent used commercial farms  That's odd. 20-29 yo people health care workers? See, universal healthcare. 

So veterans firefighters risked lives 9/11 literally fight tooth nail healthcare benefits they're done serving one wants foot bill everyone wants pretend care. state Federal governments dance around issue occasionally nominal thing universal healthcare like everywhere else world pass special bills fund healthcare veterans veterinarians vegetarians firefighters. pass special bill make covid tests vaccines free. would covered universal healthcare. 

American conservative's greatest source pleasure punishing people served plain old bad luck. love imagine they're chosen ones happen them. result worse quality life. truly magical. Honestly, yes, reality essential workers young folks real risk. It’s old folks reducing ICU capacity zero, Uber drivers. rapidly became dominant UK, originated somewhere else, place would dominance well. Hehe, hard guy. hear LOT comments idiots called antivaxers last years. Ditto. Fucking sucks. Healthy young athlete dealing mild case turned long covid hope get vaccine soon. can't help suppose go smoother federal mandates funding. Also, paperwork good indicator vaccine doses needed. Hopefully roll improve. skeptical 1A requests vaccinated Erie County.  I'm really confused story. scientists blocked visa approved. team already begin travel get visa? seem lost, facts allowed here. Feelings only. Hear that? goalposts moving. cull all, spread coronavirus variant like wildfire? still many people really want vaccine, including me.  Super. Cool. I’m far past giving crud politics now. get done. pay rent wonder don’t get stimulus check ppl use pay rent? really lucky pandemic taken seriously there. much would love crowd, absolutely want safe crowd. got long way go. vaccine work longer considered SARS-CoV-2. Moderna Pfizer vaccines imitate spike protein virus. spike protein identifier virus, spike protein change point vaccines effective virus would longer considered SARS-CoV-2. honestly probably held insurance billing. Yes! Anything says chop 4-8 weeks it. Totally possible 
He going want land plane runs gas speak. pulmonary work comes back negative may want consider seeing ENT. entity called Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD) mimic asthma episodes shortness breath. cases thought viral illness induce (the virus causes damage vagus nerve laryngeal nerves). thought... comment appreciated phone news report get fucking grip. Maybe medical professionals (not bitches) actually want people take cvoid seriously they've witnessed another death  googled says USA passed WW2 deaths (Dec 9th 2020) Death numbers justify restrictions much longer. Certainly years. get memo? COVID lives matter. Lol, hiding ad.. someone please nominate moron award? massive Operation Warp Speed failure failure fight anti-vaxx messaging. 

Anti-fax messaging federal government probably would increased resistance, current political (aka crap) environment. weeks back, math Spain 1 case every 34 people.. Yet many around part world seem unconcerned - let's wait see happens lungs / organs e.g. 5 years now. I'm sure actually lot higher we'll ever know due people asymptomatic, get test can't get test. 

Saying could also increase time goes people start getting multiple times.

Even dying cause effects long/short term. He's hedging. made comments he's moving goalposts, yes messaging could better, fine. hedging, normal (and good) scientists. course, they’re wrong, dangerously wrong. doesn’t mean deserve fucking die. Jesus Christ can’t believe explain actual fucking adults. free daycare parents. depends live. may livable children Chicago. glorifying death. ignorant honestly doesn’t deserve response, leave this—hotspots become hotspots due people justifying selfish behavior did. understand feels bad come self realization. us slipped done something questionable least this, let’s call spade spade Lol ones really bought doom mongers out. Fun fact-

Pigs often eat similar food humans, opposed ruminants like cows eat foods humans not.

So traditional prohibition pork humanitarian. food people eat diverted livestock people harder time feeding like Hank Jesse Walt trapped RV, junkyard dude told go get warrant lol 


Totally suspicious all.  False. minimum acceptable speed speed ZERO vaccines go waste. Sure aspirationally triage access... single vaccine goes waste system, stick available unvaccinated arm. needs logistical ""pressure release valve"" fuckups prevent spoilage. 

Like flying standby/flight overbooking invol bumping ensures zero empty seats plane , need way soak vaccines cannot feasibly reach ""Best possible"" arm time.

I get ""vaccinate doctors first"" got 10 minutes expiration available doctors, grab someone streets chuck bin.

we gotta get move on, man.  Yes places, particularly Germany it’s pretty much impossible given infection rates. 
The UK fantastic failure. hired thousands people ended virtually nothing. That’s click “read more” button. think onto something Chief ""study"" DOA. Propaganda countries lag reporting, Sweden outlier reports deaths death date report date. means lag becomes visible. Interesting NYC Health + Hospitals system, city’s main public hospital network, administered 31 per cent allotment, compared 99 per cent private hospitals state. doesn’t raise red flags idk else needs obviously they’re hiding something probably check data rather going instinct. mortality rates someone 70 (I assume that’s group A) much higher assuming it’s much lower group b you’re assuming. 

The data clear. 90% deaths occurring people 70. generally people working/retired. 

Teachers ahead 70 year olds terms vaccination programs....that goal actually reduce hospitalisations deaths. goal please teacher unions, means screw elderly.  former trump doctor said healthiest president ever live, said would live 200 crap, recall exact quote distance learning isnt alternative? taking would feel taking second class vaccine.

Not people, I'm sure.

RemindMe! 4 months Florida 110 deaths yesterday, Arizona equivalent 750 Florida deaths yesterday, crazy what's happening Arizona ""full lockdown"". Shit like america poorly. think needing wear mask outside close indoor seating ""full lockdown"". look nz lockdown restrictions pretending claim even half that. Strange that's horrific surprised. never going enough supply government (state federal), hyped availability vaccine (20 million doses year end, yea right). something current suggest otherwise? Would gladly interested looking new data. Thanks replies.

Oxygen concentrator 94% pure, read somewhere Internet. look homicides. tiny tiny fraction total deaths, get multiple orders magnitude coverage.

Compared that, overselling largest pandemic generations peanuts. worse anywhere else world. US even top 10 deaths per million vaccinated people country world far. simply cannot believe happening literally richest part richest country world. Bizarre. Great news. biased title. wow totally missed article conclude this. point article sliced diced data concluded one shot vaccine brings 92.7%? Start 80+, soon see slightest hint vaccines piling reduce 79+ etc. Keep age limit anymore. promise response worth read bruh.  place request vaccine? I’m young definitely want one like ASAP. *Any* healthcare worker? know like half vaccine hesitant deal covid patients right? depends live. I'm Georgia could 50-person inside wedding tomorrow wanted, breaking rules. wont happen social distancing beginning pandemic actually wondered someone sneezed near car, could AC unit pump virus didn’t circulate. Riiiight.. say I’m impressed Israel’s reaction pandemic whole, solved logistics vaccination process. First all, hold back second dose vaccine everybody gets first dose also gets second dose time. furthermore, vaccine centres even open part vaccinate people eldery homes mobile vaccination teams. soon enough vaccine open vaccination centres numbers shoot up. right now, doesnt make sense open got vaccine them. bottleneck availibility vaccine, throughput. Additionally, UK indeed island...to extent. London's role major global hub, well intense connections rest Europe, makes hard really cut rest world - see chaos last December.


I say exact thing Taiwan. People mainland fly often. People fled mainland last civil war still see family mainland fly nation.


Being island still good SARS 2003. No, Taiwan's biggest advantage learned past mistakes. today (AZ) got stats...127 deaths 7000 new cases confirmed. 52,000 cases far week Dec 27th, number continue rise tests processed next week so. crazy. know anyone November, know dozen currently it. One hospital, 2 extremely sick home, rest like flu symptoms completely incapacitate them. Fingers crossed 🤞🏻 get peer reviewed let’s get concrete possibly justify measures next winter considerable amount population vaccinated? bad timing again, time dawn Lunar New Year 2021, (early-mid Febuary), yes, remember coronavirus first spread inside China Yup, exactly. damaged heart tissue, lung tissue, brain tissue germany 1019 deaths 

thats nightmare get back watching show lol. is? long term (or even short term) disability pretty compelling reason tie re-opening declining spread rather declining mortality imo.  30 year old might die catch it, wrecking lungs rest life good reason try best prevent happening

But realistically, cases enough keep economy education shut down. Meh, it’s shit-show rate vaccination increase time. would expect get better worse. Especially new administration prioritizing virus.  definitely important things take away New Zealand—using hotels quarantine people coming in, providing TON financial support people survive lockdown, opting longer, harder lockdown instead short lockdown months questionably effective restrictions like curfews plexiglass barriers afterwards. 

That said, it’s much easier implement strategies country 5 million people, good weather, low economic inequality, land borders. think it’s possible understand strategies, also careful comparing responses country since New Zealand countries better outcomes also natural advantages based population, climate, demographics, etc. Well fuck, bud Wow....I guess believe say. CCP thinks rest world like people, whatever say 120% truth. CCP growing cancer ok face earth, hope gets removed soon possible. additional period? 
Both people get vaccine time get 90% protection.
You think it’s better one person 95% two people 70-90% protection? 
Maybe I’m missing point? Aesop’s fables. 

I keep copy reason. gotta break freezers like CA. /s aware contest. think pay extra $500 get vaccine. Sure population level graphs showing infections decreasing mask mandates introduced. 

Here’s one, lots think sub normal people, normal people want go dont much faith without actual serious lock everywhere. Lock downs work atleast 1 serious lock would much better off. Again, wrong. EEOC determined otherwise. Hospitals may choosing require lawfully allowed so. See article posted. another source please post it. slow trying vaccinate adults currenr approvals 240 million people. Further, every adult needs vaccinated things begin normalizing substantially. Lastly, we'll able vaccine even quicker 1mil/day J&amp;J AZ vaccinations approved soon. Sorry, can’t vaccinate ya. Can’t crack open next unit tomorrow! believe US should’ve never gone Iraq should’ve gotten much, much sooner did. Yeah, little googling set straight here, genetic thing, really.

Diet something else unexplained caused vast majority modern humans (Post ag-rev) horrible teeth (in comparison). What's earliest J&amp;J could approved tbe US - early/mid February? Sorry hear that. Hope sister law recovered."
