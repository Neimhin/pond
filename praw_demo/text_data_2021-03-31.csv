0,2021-03-31," flu vaccine changes every year guess what's it.

if anything ones list get ""popular"" could bad flu committee recommended quadrivalent formulation egg-based influenza vaccines U.S. 2020-2021 influenza season contain following:

* A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus;
* A/HongKong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;
* B/Washington/02/2019- like virus (B/Victoria lineage);
* B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage).

&amp;#x200B;

we could bad flu season since one year.

hard guess what's coming.

&amp;#x200B;

**This year's flu season virtually nonexistent. could bad news next toddler cancer. maybe also happens Sputnik? platform. I’m huge fan well mixed metaphors I’m gonna use one. completely correct gaslighting people thinking cautious selfish way Especially adolescents looks like could time summer. Well, vaccinated brazilian Coronavac.... believe things.

Youre allowed concerned potential 4th wave infections ticking back small fraction us fully vaccinated.

You also allowed optimistic vaccination data, knowing fully vaccinated, good. Autocorrect I'm thinking, even paying attention. It’s actually *more* likely mutates something less deadly. evolutionary standpoint, it’s better virus less lethal. would ideally want infect body long time reproduce. virus kills easily would harder time spreading. mean strictly speaking probability efficacy 77% either exactly zero exactly one; we're uncertain which. I’m board this, unfortunately viruses, contagious even know sick. argument hear people want wear mask forever. actually read article? claims, best, 90% effectiveness.
It means, read, 10% 3,950 participants (395 people think) **will carry virus infect people, people might die**.

What's even worse, mRNA vaccines. entirety world live Hoarders America live 70% effectiveness less.

Please math, hard. Thank you! kept reading leading shots, thus I’m little concerned people passed full vaxxing. age, conditions, combo? know it’s couple people still, must awful families told repeatedly shot would 100% protect us death. It’s also really important personal risk assessment; previously, question safe vaccinated people spend time unvaccinated people, vaccinated person needed careful going fun fear brining virus home unvaccinated housemate. know thing need worry direct contact unvaccinated people different households, things got lot simpler. actually read article? claims, best, 90% effectiveness.

It means, read, 10% 3,950 participants (395 people think) **will carry virus infect people, people might die**.

What's even worse, mRNA vaccines. entirety world live Hoarders America live 70% effectiveness less.

Please math, hard. Eh, prefer point people start seeing patterns like 3 talking points nutters have.

They REALLY want 'debate' screech bad data, drop links ultimate proof stomp away ""victory."" get point BS right away. hundreds, days last summer cases literal *dozens.* checking NYT counter every single day. Murphy also came saying public schools allowed offer hybrid remote learning options fall. understand what's going on. Indeed still catch carry it. nurses got vaccinations available still managed catch bring work them. I'm assuming small percentage people still catch title article bit misleading, imo. misspell venn bank? studies published last year.  Yeah I've people shout me. walk away, I'm treated like that. Tbf, even raising volume help still catch individual words. There's almost evidence variants render vaccines ineffective variants could render vaccines ineffective. media keeps pushing certain inevitable outcome can't survive good news.

I swear God people would talking nonstop peace Japan United States doomed fail writing articles World War 2. America. many people don’t give F anyone except themselves. 

People Asian countries wear concern others ill. anything, last year shown selfish people are.  None relevant.

The fact society whole makes rules unable effectively implemented. makes rules ineffective solutions. disappointment also irrelevant. 

It matter much scream dog, hes never gonna anything dog. society large.

Scream away tho. Heh, that’ll it. mostly mild cases? Sure probability retransmission never going get better original efficacy vaccine (eg 5% Pfizer) much speculation could much worse (eg vaccine 95% effective symptomatic infection 50% effective transmission). pending studies confirm result it’s gong look really good statistical basis (it still suck 5%)  Hi there! already posted Reposts removed!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wear mask required understand situation special. wear mine daily basis over.

But nice (the west) adopted mindset already exists parts world sick, wear mask? 

Masks seem place time soon anyway, might well get going we're used them. Yeah, I'm afraid P1 + south africa variant mutation together.
P1 problem transmission.  
South African variant problem bigger immune escape. 
Imagine together? Same, plus forced enforce mask protocol dealing backlash feeling stressed ever. I’m eyeballs incident reports mask enforcement temperature checks. put one chip left shoulder, right. 

that way chips synchronize bombard hemispheres brain

/s  O;-) Last checked, playgrounds closed.

Karens seem think anything less idyllic childhood scar little Timmy life he'll become Ed Gein. People world go things way worse year remote school come side fine. intelligent people could’ve guessed this.

""Most intelligence people"" would told outcome certain. vaccines provide substantial protection transmission. Waiting studies confirm vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection vaccinated individuals prudent thing do. Headlines like ""Whole world protected coronavirus vaccine infection, based century immuno-biological science"" generate clicks.

""Could deadly, virulent, vaccine-resistant COVID variant sweep world?"" generate clicks, even answer ""Lol, no, immune system robust enough deal part."" I'm still wearing masks get 2nd shot, ass freaks everyone out. 

Besides, help allergies pretty well, decent amount things. 


....... Also issues like currently bronchitis, ya know.... Also helps..... Stupid lungs. I'd love normal choose like Asia. I'm ditching mine soon I'm fully vaccinated. 15% country fully vaccinated. problem cases rise. vaccine sterilizing, either. reasonably close sterilizing. RemindMe! March 31th, 2022 century, pandemics killed flu.

Why believe this, ""figures lie""? cold year. #maskswork LOL, good luck I'll admit obvious joke. we, redditors, obligation, someone made obvious joke DUTY it. large segment population doesn’t want get vaccinated, aren’t conflicting views. long live great Hoarders America. mean, snarky internet comments fine far go, question ""did data?"" Public health officials luxury saying stuff based hunch intuition, matter strong things may imply anything. Data needs come in. takes time. LOL no. old people people compromised immune systems consider wearing masks more, offices consider increasing WFH bad flu seasons jobs impacted.  Actually do. It’s called rural America. people live sparsely populated areas. silent bearers necessarily spreaders. report direct implications safe school reopening, serves another counterexample myth kids get covid.   Who? most?  ""Normal""?

Don't ""many people saying"" bullshit, one brain would believe anybody spouted shit. [I believe states set date guaranteed deadline, shocked move 400,000,000 doses set distributed end May Moderna Pfizer- I'm sure Johnson Johnson numbers today's news- absolutely think we'll hitting herd immunity United States very, soon. think there's legitimate safety reason maintain restrictions summer.

Hopefully soon we'll looking walk vaccinations. think biggest issue large portion population scheduling vaccination. know there's concern people exposing going pharmacy vaccination location, but- hate tell you- overwhelming supermajority Americans already going whatever. Since Americans gotten vaccine far high risk, think walk vaccinations going become helpful harmful soon, already. ethical way open back offer vaccine everyone wants one, open back up. kids still catch spread unvaccinated adults I’m wishing harm. never said get seriously ill, infected. They’re putting risk infected I’m saying let theirselves. can’t stop them. really is

Had EU actually got vaccinations people faster forth wave happening ""Vaccine passports"" literally travel passports. term used refer domestic vaccination status identifiers. They've news week. Please become misinformed allow shit become reality. pfizer 95% effectiveness. means, 100 people, 5 get infected spread virus other, maybe unvaccinated people, people die.

Do math, please. hard. Yeah we’ve there. 100% true. people never want things return normal.

It's fine point. risk involved everything. Stay home worried, go shit care.

We vaccinated soon. That’s going happen least 5% time virtue vaccine 100% effective 

I’m happy see data come don’t fault experts optimistically cautious Lol everything back normal July 4th watch. think sometimes health experts realize good vaccines really  Vaccines mandatory go public spaces period. Washington state news 102 fully vaccinated people tested positive COVID. scary sounds, 1.2 million fully vaccinated people here. So... 0.008%. riskis insanely low. link could share? I'd interested signing child. 15m vaccines wasted. people get jailed this... I'd rather let catch COVID implement vaccine passports society. I'd rather let breeding ground mutations live world need scan digital vaccine passport buy groceries. That's path I'm willing go down. needed. get three half four million natural infection obviously sane practical, congress

Found problem! Yeah, happening. J&amp;J announced 15 million doses ruined due quality control failure. Workers subcontractor Baltimore mixed two ingredients. 15 million supposed part J&amp;J's surge. subset people sides cannot abide kind nuance. either ""vaccines work, pandemic over"" ""vaccines work well enough, lockdown forever.""

The truth like ""vaccines work, end pandemic, yet, work together bit make sure enough people get vaccinated."" would argue making everyone wait pay increases everyone worse. It’s bad enough workers put awful pay business squeeze by, exposure risk deadly pandemic. Maybe business model location trash, workers shouldn’t subsidize situation think psychological response government terrible start with. really didn’t seem analyze (or correctly analyze) best way get compliance national populace. Fauci may qualified kind social engineering what’s say don’t psych experts advising behind scenes? Like he’s public face pandemic response. would stop laughing either. doesn’t mean everyone able get appointment immediately. vaccine providers certainly need volunteers next couple months. that's headline says: zero chances, speak absolutes.

And that's entire problem article, still r/coronavirus. People take stuff granted. Maybe Europe thanks excellent vaccines US needed cried last person house got shot. actually last one bc kids pfizer novavax trial. took antibody tests knew placebo. vaccines became available group, called see would cross placebos real novavax. date yet ended dropping out. got vaccine next day. Another two weeks things really feel different whole family. large portion AK counties also medically underserved well. VICE segment following couple traveling pharmacists AK little startling see far lot people medical help. Especially something like COVID-19 cause strokes breathing issues. worked well thought Germany FFP2 masks. answer covid vaccines. plenty supply July take get shots peoples arms. That's need much supply possible reach herd immunity around then. validity rules isn’t based around whether people like not. virus spreading people breaking rules, underscores important rules are. still getting 11 million J&amp;J next week? assume trashed 15 million Well, ""Pfizer"" vaccine funded developed Germany, example. seeing far little it. Timing mean anything reliably. Could mean immunity already, could mean nothing.

The timing crapshoot, probably based metabolism randomness. 

The symptoms mean working though. symptoms *doesn't* mean working. me, main side effect killer headache. Solved problem beers, hope feel better king. AZ rollout could lot better Thanks! worries! Yeah, saw too. true, doesn’t portray whole story. 😊

It’s true variants mutation showed resistance vaccine-induced antibodies, don’t know particular one (despite mutation) will. 

And despite slight resistance, antibodies still largely neutralized it. It’s like winning battle fewer troops, still winning it!

And there’s happening immune system antibodies - see third link posted. It’s fascinating read.

I guess we’ll wait see! make appointments 15th now? Hypothetical question here. 

My wife vaccinated. work home outside contacts. 

My sister husband fully vaccinated, going like crazy. church, working busy restaurant, teaching underprivileged kids, god knows else know about. 

Is safe us visit Easter dinner? Indoors, several hours least, largely unmasked? hard thing is: know many people simply can’t get vaccinated legitimate diseases like cancer, MS, etc... it’s hard basically shut point family members extremely careful.

People refusing get vaccinated going prolong risk isolation people. selfish stupid. literally ignore large portion people refuse vaccine think population main issues people solid organ transplants. anti-rejection drugs take super powerful reducing immune systems. vaccine isaue; ability make antibodies issue. support opposite reason. wish flex non-vax. Dab immune systems. vaccinated, don’t carry risk passing virus, still reason wear mask vaccinated? Genuine question since end eventually Wherever funding look find new variants. variants areas less funds; still know worry me. work quality management

Is using two semicolons one sentence passes quality days? Okay first all, punishing people making nearly impossible function society different making vaccine mandatory

It absolutely is.

One bodily autonomy - definitely believe concept ""your body choice"". absolutely would support, would even willing protest forced vaccinations. support them.

However step public sphere, affecting yourself. affecting me. affecting family, friends, neighbors.

You want protect us getting vaccinated? excuse French, take hike. Can't interact society? want you. Consider trying argue government able restrict someone go based digital document

The government restricting anyone. passport almost certainly give businesses data, upon make decisions customers allow in.

Per Biden administration senior ""Unlike parts world, government viewing role place create passport, place hold data citizens,"" Slavitt said March 29 press briefing. ""We view something private sector Explain extremely slippery slope toward social credit scores Chinese people deal with?

China social credit scores, really (they name shame list people lawsuit judgments them). Western media keeps reporting idea, I'm dating Chinese girl (and 4-5 years). learned non-trivial amount Chinese (我可以说一点点中文), China. keep asking Chinese people social credit scores (because keep seeing articles time) - China Chinese people living US, literally nobody even knows wtf talking about.

There's certainly surveillance China (I've done tests censorship WeChat, main Chinese chat app, make sensitive messages invisible based keywords, part), fuckton cameras everywhere, social credit scores fake idea. Maybe Chinese government go direction eventually, envisioning Black Mirroresque app everybody rates everybody government gives score - Second all, fuck protecting banning vaccinated people society?

Er what? intend exclude **un**vaccinated people understand that, unvaccinated people forced interact unvaccinated people?

I mean would still able see unvaccinated people vaccinated person, vice versa wanted to, would literally business thing. hell envisioning thing working? seem very, incorrect idea people proposing. Policy follow data. can’t conclude Fauci anti science waiting evidence updating advice. know extremely layman's, kinda keep wondering efficacy half-dosed Pfizer's Moderna's shot could been, close (like many shots could given time, lifes spared, shorter pandemic. would almost many shots Brazil given finally win war anti-vaxxers. good rule thumb NJ big locations mostly Pfizer. state megasites. sites associated hospitals like st Joseph’s, valley health, new bridge medical center I’m sure others I’m forgetting. pharmacies I’d say like 70-80 percent Moderna seems recently getting Pfizer (especially cvs). county resident sites Moderna exceptions. great, cases rising bit deaths plateauing somewhat 1K 3 days week, little 2-3 days week, well 1k sundays. Vaccinations well matter time get thing control. Oof take back said. RIP tacos 🪦 Oh 100%, theres relatively new college major called Genomics. Studying human genomes scientists found significant part DNA came different source (likely Viruses). Science truly amazing true, coworker recently tested positive covid fully vaccinated 7 weeks? case rate adjusted situations these, since Inyo drastically different say LA? That's Sacramento, actual case rate one number, adjusted slightly higher take account population density. NJ it’s like 51 percent Moderna, 47 percent Pfizer, 2 percent J&amp;J iirc. Probably varies state Unless Fauci. ;) Seeing there's already new strains there. Viruses mutating faster they're traveling world adapting different people's environments. brother sister refuse vaccinated. brother said would wait longer see safe thought ok vaccinated. I'm 15 years older. Jerk. make great Case Study process engineering students, if/when sordid story ever escapes corporate non-disclosure agreements. FDA course investigating hammering right now, trust flaw caused particular failure patched, rest process reviewed. Keeping fingers crossed. death percentage statistically significant, good result. r/boneappletea Colbert repeat weeks ago. supposed put four times amount garlic powder onion powder accidentally switched far oniony garlicky enough. know J&amp;J workers going through. Hook Johnson Johnson. Problem solved weren’t social distancing measures hospitals would filled would lost countless people 

we legit could full hospital entire summer, injury accidents occur. dont believe anything say point production. They’ve already way behind schedule don’t buy they’re going make fiasco. Hopefully I’m wrong gonna hold breath one. “Other variants contain mutation B.1.243.1 strain shown resistance vaccines, added”

But yes vaccines life saving whole family is.. saying comment good! Underrated comment amazing IASIF scene. Here's clip, anybody's interested: cared gain perspective others, thanks concern! mean....if cases drastically higher reported means death rates even LOWER amongst children. Maybe immune definitely worrisome especially elderly vaccinated. Sorry, reading article mentioned that. I’ll reread quote. Wait ruin it? feel like onion garlic powder would work well taco seasoning mix. forfeit public healthcare. tax $ need pay antivax ignorance. 

(I hope goes without saying, mean people medical conditions preclude vaccinated) I've seen/heard many comments people hoping get J&amp;J vaccine idea still 100% effective keeping dying hospital. hear lower effeciency moderna pfizer freaks people out. normal someone relate international news they're from. people US, would follow stories would often related US. Well guess what, mRNA vaccines happen work wonderfully variant. Original. Yes, relax enjoy weekend, fine! counts stop 6am, you’ll likely tomorrow’s count  use ""keep information high quality"" report ""other"" report put misinformation. idiots state level miscalculated population size PA's 4 populous counties: Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Bucks (all outside Philly) received least number doses, proportionally. extreme shortages 4 counties. People drive 3 hours way, way State College, get shots. absolutely ridiculous Southeastern PA! It’s children worry about. get mild illness get messed it’s poor kids’ fault. probability 

Depends takes. optimization problems constraints optimize around.

Should we, let’s say, continue mask distance December even though hospital’s completely free overwhelmed attempt completely prevent spread *might* super immaterial probability vaccine resistant mutation? **No.** notice article (New York Times), data yet reviewed independent experts. Huh.... muh freedom “a lot” 50/100k two week period, fat finger mistake. I'm even sure Governor worded way, here's news source tracking 50 cases/100k/14 days rate: alert: Ohio moving away from, towards, 50c/100k/14d last two weeks. weird around least couple weeks now. Esp. Daily Discussion thread. I'm confused though point. thread frontpage CDC director? similar said vaccinated people ""can't carry"" virus. super happy read that. 

But saying get vaccinated, even wear mask, distance wash hands

I problem steps, but.. vaccinated people can't carry viruses purpose additional step washing hands, social distancing masking vaccinated? Oh wow, mine pretty empty depends suppose Anti-vaxxers growing numbers boldness. might effective educate benefits microchip Bill Gates.  

Fight stupid stupid. basically error Chilean government made third wave breaking records country highest vaccination rate world. problem spread mutate strain resistant current vaccines suddenly back square one. Funny enough, mom's friend religious precautions &amp; husband fully vaccinated. husband later tested positive, moved heaven &amp; earth let test result get out. quite hilarious 😂 Well yeah risk severe illness death pretty much zero right?? also believe car accidents deadly since personally never died one? Thank god schools taking serious precautions prevent infections. Since kids’ elementary school opened September 6 cases. *knock wood* kicking ass working hard keep kids 6 feet apart masked. Teachers mostly vaccinated weather nice plan lot stuff outside. Schools need safely reopen it’s kids’ mental health horrendous. every single topic US? Even American company that's works out, that's good. Vaccinate everyone think logically, use weaponized covid designed wipe everyone else. serve 2 purposes, covid gone way trump get elected voters gone. let Darwin take them. doubt get J&amp;J vaccine. They've halted production weeks today. friend fully vaccinated February tested positive last week (no symptoms direct exposure). CDC called him. &lt;1% Well, necessarily. What’s source?

1. variant new. B.1.243 first identified November 2020. Source: contains E484K mutation, requires antibodies neutralize studies show indeed, evades antibodies, protection provided vaccines still likely sufficient. Source: Antibody response one type response elicited vaccination. Vaccines also invoke T-cell protection, fend variants. Source: variant innocent proven guilty. Let’s carry vaccinations. Care even read article? think person you’re replying talking valid scared everyone vaccinated. risk low point it’s worth burden accommodate. Everyone else needs live lives risk low. It’s life we’ve got. hope mods keep April fools crap subbreddit. important jokes, news source many people. I'd go, necessarily safest thing world least outdoors friend protection. There's decent chance I, like many, getting J&amp;J vaccine, seems work slowly.

Aside that, *might be* less effective individual basis, though still good enough herd immunity everyone while. See I'd put August **every** state, I'm mildly conservative estimates. probably right we'll mostly back normal July.

My birthday July certainly intend going drinks point speed we're progressing. speaking raw humanity standpoint

We need people think way. Seriously. disturbing running people forget numbers represent someone's mother, father, child, grandparent, uncle, aunt... get picture. maybe recognize COVID metrics metrics considering. can't say 100%, read Pfizer, Moderna, Jansen contra-indications. contra-indication immunosuppressed immunocompromised people. *Of course, vaccines may work well.* contra-indications **do overlap** mRNA Ad-vector vaccines. I'm trouble determining able take COVID vaccine.

We deal free riders vaccines diseases. wonderful. I'm unsure reasonable strategy. Exile? Coventry? Shooting people vaccine rounds tranquilizer rifles? Imprisonment? I'm open ideas, see workable alternative. 100% cool too. bread variants?  Fair point philippines, common sense public officials greatly needed top health protocols. deaths still low, 10 today. That’s lot lower daily state pretty low cases whole time. Let’s see plays metrics thinking sky falling. highly likely get mRNA vaccine. Pfizer vaccine truly scaled successfully far, J&amp;J production stopped today due contamination issue (they mixed bunch J&amp;J another vaccine's reagents) Unfortunately, concern either bodily autonomy individual liberties very, narrow. didn’t feel first dose either! person administered skillful made sure relax, probably helped. got sick, Trump. Two dumb ass coworkers afternoon saying covid bullshit people actually infected influenza influenza B. One covid didn’t die basically 500k + die never actually existed cause it’s bad. Fair enough. Thanks responding! Thank you, know vaccine could work like first shot, he’s right. CDC conducted study found 80% effectiveness. Otherwise, agree need rush things like wear masks. could’ve masked since Day 1 Nope. Pfizer supplied 50% EU need far. EU get 600M Pfizer doses year. Yeah smart. really listen guy instead ridiculizing him. think three distinct categories folks dealing here:

* Hard Core Anti-vaxers - probably take death family, severe illness major thing convince them. likely relatively small minority folks luckily.
* Vaccine Hesitant - Folks taken vaccines pro-vaccine, may legitimate concerns relative novelty vaccines want ""wait see."" know one guy like this. super smart real data analytics guy. convinced sample size categorization side effects sufficient depth trial data. convinced treasure trove real-world data coming Israel safety efficacy. group come around soon I'm sure.
* Vax Lazy - Folks believe vaccine, take literally brought silver platter get shopping Target without appt wait. folks motivated enough go ""hunting"" vaccine inconvenienced way. Gut feel tells group biggest hurdle. Exactly. number one problem I've entire time complete lack sort finish line. Add CDC Fauci getting even negative data piling blowing estimates water. ending, quickly. Give us stationary target we're going end ourselves. Well evolution doesn’t “want” anything, doesn’t try become less deadly, it’s random.

Unless there’s something else, besides you’ve stated, makes likely become less deadly, it’s equally likely becomes less deadly. Ah yes, another relatively vapid article CTV. considering reading this; it’s basically opinion one doctor little cited data. 

To Canadian friends, stick CBC news needs sure test protein quantitative assay? Exactly that.

Never sign contract don’t understand. real damage lungs!!! get second shot 6th! Can’t wait currently outbreak Canadian cardiac institute among vaccinated true story. Cant believe want too.
I bring ton guys dont care. wanna defend virus survived point. Yep, exactly this. I've got shot recently coworkers looking like I'm insane. despite fact factory I'm working plans vaccinate 80% workers, provided free vaccine, workers still telling made excuses fourth week already. Plus covid denying quite strong Russia, especially smaller towns villages. LA county like ""You guys opened schools?"" I'm genuinely curious. I'm 5'9"" feet touch floor there's like much excess feel cramped leg/foot wise middle seats. arms shoulders tho, that's another story Kent virus kids spread propose? wear masks indefinitely? going away. point need realistic. Huh, I’m 99% sure FDA stated phase 3 trials weren’t necessary approval. Pfizer even mentioned investor call would need proceed trials size anymore booster shots 

Maybe they’re still conducting ongoing phase 3 trial gather data? Even it’s needed approval Except talking good ol' fashioned run mill DVT here. won’t “dud”. story doses used. fact highlights good quality assurance J&amp;J and/or FDA.  damn, fuck cancer. outlined post. one us active time. debate, decided show solidarity. monitoring news case something substantial broke. intentionally added vaccine link private sub message ensure resources provide stayed available. 

Thank support. almost like concrete goals beginning instead ""when masters feel like it"". wonderful idea, happen. It’s seen Canada, many provinces imposing new lockdowns it.  Number covid patients ICU reached time high. Number people hospital continuing rise doctors warned may start choosing save hospitals reach full capacity. situation dire France terms hospitlisations. Man. I’m glad I’ve Montana majority shit. raw dogging air whole time (because I’m outside around people, I’m anti mask) can’t imagine able extended period time. Well, people natural fear skepticism new ideas. perfectly rational response. problem idea actually well-established, *falsely described* new, engenders fear skepticism engendering trust.

For example, conservatives USA often describe policies like UBI, UHC, Keynesian-style economic stimulus ""experimental"" new ideas cooked left thin air, reality system akin UBI place Alaska since 1976, UHC successfully implemented pretty much developed nations world decades, Keynesian-style economic stimulus helped pull us lingering effects Great Depression New Deal wartime spending WWII.

A crucial aspect science's trustworthiness authority institution truth derived time-tested ideas are. painting time-tested ideas new experimental undermines that. ok hear out, bad flu kids? would ever shut capacity flu? know some1, foreign living vietnam looking stories, think pandemic going on. always large groups, hiking, going dance classes, etc. I've never seen mask any1 pictures.

So fkin jealous government right things. literally year meeting even seeing some1 new social environment. gf, happened single I'd probably jumped balcony now. Worked many friends. insane political issue. else do. lockdown permanently end threat covid brings cases hospitlisations levels doctors cope. cases start increasing open careful rises back hospitals longer cope. vaccine programme colossal failure speed desperately need something meantime.

Idk guess know could also, like, go read studies someone posted done people really know lot us say thing happening Still good idea careful while, man good news makes ecstatic day get vaccine. still need wear masks? that’s exactly policy - spread myth. might gone school either Operation Poo Speed - Joe Biden French don’t release numbers regarding recovering sadly clip share this? can’t find anything Late Show’s YouTube simple news search Google. right. lot threat novel coronavirus ""novel"" part. people seem forgotten that. novel body... 80% odds little bit worse Russian Roulette six-shooter... fucking way play game odds. Well way out... back UK approach, Americans rushing things Well variants structurally super specific scale. mRNA vaccine targets one specific protein structure SARS-CoV-2 strain essentially exists variants, immune response triggered vaccine theoretically responsive current future variants. 

The new vaccine technology developed almost good stay indoors year. definitely agree could eradicate major illnesses future. That's always say every struggle always silver lining. People vaccines one reason another essentially left dark ages. EU caused UKs early approval starting vaccinations month earlier? cause UK start construction vaccine plants 3 months earlier? EU mandate UK switched longer jab intervals? EU inspire extremely high approval adoption vaccines leading one world's highest uptakes?

That's impressive, shame themselves. vaccine, dropped floor went even lower without vaccine. staying low forever interesting. Thats funny. love masks much never plan taking ever again. can't believe lived without before! done vaccine passports? *liiiiikely*, safe, we'll proles shelter place another years. drop bombs, we'll consider giving another ~~$2000~~ ~~$1400~~ $600 stimulus check. two big pharma players west, it’s surprise. French Swiss people jump one me: yes, Sanofi Roche bigger companies Bayer etc, size pharma industry Germany bigger don’t know you’re talking about. One current dangerous variants six points genetic mutation popped nowhere. genetic record mutation happening multiple people time. 

And right, replication question. So, regular individual, mutation occurs, doesn’t really time become dominant virus body doesn’t spread. immunocompromised person, does. another mutation occurs, forth. mutations build one another within one individual, speeding process would take months general populace.

2 million sub yet peak 100,000 -200,000 actives. 

Not it’s mere 5,000 10,000 best Conservatives tend huge sceptics. Many sceptics anti. sceptical need lockdowns(negative effects v. positive effects). don’t know personal anecdotes. r/bestof damn report, read headline can't bother reading report. Key point draw this: keep masked practice much social distancing possible herd immunity reached. took least. 

Tbh US better tracing quarantining outbreaks “normal” would come lot quicker sustainable. Look AU. alas, still ways go front. End Q2 realistic. Best scenario end July necessary doses adults. need factor time distribute every person plus 3-4 weeks delay shots. End summer (i.e. September 21st) lot realistic targer date entire population know data vaccines preventing transmission conclusive? I’m really sure bar is, know keep seeing individual study individual study suggest really good things. point data become universally valid?

I’m noticing lot fragmented opinion late. serious holdouts friend circle still saying things like “vaccines protect getting COVID, protect symptoms” even though actually loads data suggesting prevent infection. UK recorded roughly similar levels blood clots Pfizer AZ vaccines per dose given neither especially expected populace. clusters Germany Norway utterly bizarre. point I'm 'whatever you' stage, vaccination program worked fantastically cases, admissions deaths plummeting, others want things differently that's skin nose. sure EU pick slack send guys doses over! NPR story listened specifically interviewed doctor patient studied. Furthermore, plasma thing affected counts.

Additionally, antibodies infected aren’t efficient keeping safe antibodies formed vaccine. *because aren’t structurally same* hard time vaccinating quickly mutating viruses without annual boosters past mRNA vaccine medical breakthrough eradicate many illnesses future.  Perhaps country vaccines readily available - 8 billion Globe isnt doesnt luxury choice. 
Not offered one least would delay His/her vaccination literally could GIVE extra waste prevention vaccines away Walmart Idaho. peak 4pm Friday. I’d estimate 80% shoppers weren’t wearing masks (or least properly - including workers) agree here. That’s good America still sucks wherever world vaccines going.  Yah isnt thats happened virus.? Didn’t even show symptoms two weeks (if ever cases).

I know death rate focus head r/Covidlonghaulers get glimpse relatively healthy people effected months, sometimes year. don’t want get ever even I’m hospitalized. long term effects symptoms seem horrendous. 

If anybody data vaccine effectiveness shortening long-term symptoms I’d super curious see! 👀 sure this? J&amp;J seems high (promised) presence. example Denmark expecting 400k doses month (though course question whether they’ll pull through...) Considering Green Party got rid antivax platform within decade, chance. hippie dippie types hate vaccines, too. coming? Macron, VDL like random innocents govern going suffer mistakes?

Please remember people suffering dying, many pay little attention international politics. Thet definitely sympathy. Ya, can't think single time I've ever heard ""100% prevents people catching ""whatever"""" accurate.

Shit clickbait. plant live since late February, however vaccine manufacturing lifecycle 6-8 weeks average, depending we’re talking about. we’re seeing shipments mid-April Marburg I’ll never forget making decision join sub ~late jan/early February 2020 clear something keep eye on. day click unsubscribe great one.

And friends still give shit hanging them, idgaf. almost made it. feel like title probably completely incorrect. Agreed. Yep, nothing changed really since early 2020, still 60% people see walking around stores without masks. reason cases dropping people getting shots. Oh don’t understand. It’s one person contributing variants Covid, it’s one person incubates variant multiple points variance, multiple mutations.  true. German government paid helped construct BioNTech Marburg plant record breaking speed. main source delay procurrement lags roughly one quarter year behind US/UK gotta solve overpopulation somehow! /s Data ""SUGGESTS"". IDK, got card got jab, I'd fine show get ""this done"" levels. like get passport something. TBF Moderna's executives sell shares way generally shows low self-confidence. think chief medical expert held zero shares one point pandemic. thing is, multi-variant strains shouldn’t developed like this, would stages. like, variant one mutation, variant variant, etc. way evolution happens. One mutation time, genetic record gradual changes mapping variants showing *this isn’t happening* normal viruses behave. new variant pop seemingly nowhere multiple mutations. Honestly, I'll take able spread child go out. alone would huge relief me. now, know 100% sure carry transmit virus vaccinated, vaccine mean much lifestyle change Yes, vaccine uptake high enough.

Let know dates wrong states. thank scientists that. still can’t believe able get highly effective vaccine quickly. thought we’d dealing therapeutics treat worst cases, we’d getting really sick point. shot yesterday didn’t feel damn thing. 🤷 true immunity lasts long time, don’t think need worry much don’t get vaccinated. don’t care asshat doesn’t want get shot willing risk getting COVID long don’t infect get shot. guy work said he’s getting shot said doesn’t need won’t die COVID he’s healthy. asked risk infecting others? didn’t answer. RemindMe! 5 months TRUE!!!!

Sorry, apparently not, according ABC people still able contract Covid-19 get sick, although small percentage, um, CDC wrong again. least FDA correct, vaccine 95% effective, 5% still get it.

Please. people, think yourselves, rely media hyped ""experts"". would better vaccinate everyone simultaneously, that's possible.

The indications Brazil mutations occur patients immune compromised harbor virus months.

Now, yes, selecting variants via non-uniform vaccination, UK variant becoming dominant anyway greater rate infection. theory, yes, prioritized spreaders instead ""vulnerable"", since vulnerable stay home. really, perfect solution. infectious variants \*will\* predominate.

Lacking better solutions, least encourage mask-wearing, give credit anyone says so, including former Vice Presidential candidates. That's risk infection right? risk needing hospitalized essentially 0% I'm mistaken? Biontech also manufacturing site Marburg, Germany capacity 1 billion doses per year. come? know rate per day is, know Toronto vaccinated 500k people (population 2.93M) even mask mandate. bad many people refused wear one even try socially distance. Glad end nearing though! Would explain flu large estimated contingent asymptomatic cases death rate among 20-29 year olds Brazil \*tripled\* P.1 variant, 0.1% now. displace UK variant, currently becoming dominant US? know. variants definitely coming.

All need wear masks another 2 months get vaccinated, that's difficult many people.

Anyway, I'm often offended people talk declining death rates (not case, generically), nothing matters except keeping elderly people alive extra year two. I'm personally worried long-haul covid, death, think fair worry economic consequences well. wide middle ground whole pandemic response. Uuh. Yes. Read article. Finding new one cuz mine really mean doesnt care me. 
But yes, EDS. Nobody ever examined effects immune system. say EDS can! deathly ill kid literal sense. recourse immunologist second shot, haha. late I've converting everything percentage getting first dose per day. seems like running 0.7% per day. think May 1st we'll 60% one dose more. Plus probably 10% remaining natural immunity.

Hopefully end May start vaccinating teenagers 12-15. wonder predictive b cells part reason auto immune disorders?

Real nice. That's I've always worn masks I've even felt little off, wish accepted previously! Don’t wait government. Drop mask soon you’re vaccinated. anyone doesn’t like ignore them. hoping would ease restrictions based # infections low positivity rates tests. 

This way account people already covid opted vaccines. Varizona Since global production capacity vaccines limited, would meant less vaccines countries beginning, EU done ""better job"" early procurement.
So doubt EU would popular internationally successfull / ruthless. Especially UK, big winners current situation. 

This global competition scare vaccines bound cause upset one way another
And course respective national media heating mood even more. 

As citizen EU, I'm favor exports countries severe shortage vaccines currently hard hit Covid. much countries allready much better EU.

So much selfishness must allowed. way sue anybody Arkansas? want mask mandate stay reach certain point immunity Presumably matter risk tolerance, may small risk vastly lower risk delaying vaccinating large numbers people UK variant deadly infectious. Studies show 50% deadly 50% infectious.  humble opinion based on? Ukraine would much harder government hide facts than, say, Belarus Russia. Greece we’ve strict lockdown month cases keep rising. Getting first dose weekend can't fucking wait since Fauci said vaccine work still wear masks social distance even vacinated. blatant misinterpretation statistics. Nobody give reliable answer it’s properly understood yet. NIH received billion dollars funding study it, answers eventually basically taking data two weeks decide Germany laughing stock ""this Germans unhappy"". Data two weeks, one week, simply shows countries different stages wave. it, like, serious argument?

Spain case rate 189 last two weeks. Much lower US. Cases also around 13-14%, US. Must vaccines, right? they're different stage wave? 

I can't even.

Also, I'm even sure taking data from. case rate last 14 days basically US Germany (both around 295). anything, show US can't even lower case rate Germany's even vaccines have... Looks like someone pass biology school. Nice false premise fallacy there.

Just Flu Covid symptoms overlap mean doctors willy nilly deciding ""I'm gonna say that's Covid."" tests that.

There Molecular Antigen tests tell us someone actually infected with. Yes, went doctor symptoms, doctor would ""diagnose"" Flu Occam's Razor. luxury anymore say that. test need know is. Ask someone works healthcare.

Stating corruption real proof feel real. Bring evidence. feelings.

I little mean beginning, I'm going take out. Listen, really sceptical good faith please search ask little science circles. Facebook. Hungary probably celebrating this... militant group Al-Shabab rejected Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine citing 'ineffective adverse' side effects. really odd UK media invested particular vaccine. wondering information long term effects Covid-19 yet vaccinated? get Covid-19 access vaccin? live shorter lives? lungs organs permanently damaged? reliable sources? yo thats deal still Virus transfer fast still kills many people die, article anything them.

And get long term health complications, fact change them.

It black white, like comments pointing hypothetical black trying show opposite say everything white Ok. comments unbelievable me.

Those survive immune. almost new it. don't, won't. change still need fight disease. article clearly states elders direct contacts relatives people outside structure, therefore care workers (of whom, 26 27 refused vaccine) could infected them.

Yeah, another head-scratcher Mike DeWine. know can't say 3.57 cases/100k since that's daily equivalent (50/14d) Asshole anti-vaxxers currently downvoting everything this. young people died vaccine COVID-19 Norway. “top health officials worry another Covid-19 wave”

Has ever time health officials weren’t worried? Covid, ever? irresponsible messaging new variant inevitably evolve around vaccines meant socially engineer behavior vaccinated people. want keep vaccinated people feeling anxious keeping measures order avoid two-tiered society problems would go along that. “don’t anything fun vaccination, variants!” narrative allows convince vaccinated stay away crowds keep masks “until know more,” happens around time everyone wants vaccine able get one. Hopefully ""at least 6 months"" turns ""over year"" data. ride motorcycle, often nagging feeling first miles *that something important*, im physically restrained device. states. they’re pretty fringe tend wack job conspiracy theorists anti-vax. post link Croatian study? Neither people immune getting it, human immune system works Troll like flu

I want flu prevent it. Cold either matter. 5 get infected spread virus other, maybe unvaccinated people, people die.

Oh certainty people die? virus become deadly sudden?  Yeah, employee similar symptoms. lasted 2 days got tested. positive covid. shut entire office exposed ton people. part club vaccine. vaccines vary length effectiveness. flu vaccine administered annually, example. It’s big deal right it’s first time ever entire world. time next year, it’s necessary, like getting flu, pneumonia, number routine shots pretty much get walking pharmacy. Shit clickbait.

It's opposite clickbait. headline gives bottom line result motivate click article.

A clickbait article would like, ""Is vaccine 100% effective? Here's researchers found."" never officially flowed sub want longterm commitment it. check daily. less often lately. Canada relies vaccines EU  though? extremely well written sourced, fails differentiate infection serious illness. Pursuing infections wrong goal post. deaths hospitalizations lagging indicator, here’s hoping amid obviously real surge get first wide scale view sharp decoupling cases negative outcomes. Let’s get shots arms ASAP.  

In logical move, means won’t done.  Maybe portion j&amp;j mobile deployment popup/ walk clinics hotspots. It’s easy store one done efficacy 14 days. Heck MI could bombarded hotspots vaccine ice cream trucks giving 1000 doses day. even lockdown anyways lol, ever lives grey zones currently see right chuckle. Business usual. think time. unbelievably lucky. Science 🙌🏾 Even better! Maybe Germans push bit, heavenly invested vaccine R&amp;D Germany including Biontech one. Pfizer would want make extra effort reason, Either goodwill either view profitable follow-up Europe somewhere next year. Yes, infections pursing end, hospitalizations death?

Seems latter former, humans circulating viruses result symptomatic illness since...forever.

News 11. Current data Croatian means study notice.

Altho discussion reinfections infections. Literally nobody, am, gets tested without showing symptoms. People got CVT Pfizer too.......  No. means data lasting longer 6 months tests havent done, time flows linearly. *been* long enough say anything lasting longer that. anecdotal, meaningless person referring yet fully vaccinated.  follow-up? 15 minutes sitting around? need vaccinate animals too? [Israel obligation provide vaccine citizens Palestinian It’s already provided vaccines 100,000 Palestinians, far anyone else has. responsibility Palestinian Authorities provide vaccines people govern failed that. responsibility global community make sure vaccines. nations far, far wealthier Israel step now. 

&amp;nbsp; 


Also, Palestinian Territories camps. self-governing territory. infrastructure support distribution Moderna vaccine, requires deep freezing. Agreed. Anything reduces non-lethal condition win, everything else gravy. really, really great news. three big questions are:
1. long?
2. Variants?
3. infect others?

The news last week week give favorable answers three. 

Immunologists Reddit, predictions long protection lasts? Since almost zero percent fatality rate age group cares. since seems know vaccine me. city, allow first dose administered dont enough booster shot, believe get first shot booster wait months vaccine get booster 1 month first dose? 

Yeah I'm wearing mask mandated overwhelming data coming saying exceptionally rare vaccinated people get sick spreaders.

Crazy could stereotype 2 comments selfish POS! I've teaching kids person online entire year taking every precaution.

Hope fun wearing mask distancing forever terrified shadow. Go f\*\*\* yourself!  I’m 4th year immunology PhD student cellular immunity last forever. wane time. vaccine recipient level anti-Covid antibodies rest his/her life, levels may drop levels longer protective.

It likely antibodies remain protective levels years patients. However, anticipate point booster shot necessary maintain appropriate antibody titers. There's question marks EUs figures, example UK number adds include 4m made UK, sent EU bottling returned back January EU gave AZ approval. Mutations survive thrive based environmental variables i.e. hosts immune system, variant ecosystem changes drastically, medical interventions, etc. None really cause drastic drift variability dominant mutations unless talking years. body limiting it, fact environmental variables one person change much drastically. link medical journal study, I'll able actually look it. Yup finally felt like something look forward to. apparently summer already trashed never going away expect live shitty day again. Hurray. Hey everybody, guy vaccine tree. Get him!! say sure, turns vaccine needs boosters, ignorant antivaxers screeching loudly CDC LIED one want get vaccine. lucky jabbed one EU disappointment vaccine issues regardless WHO's incompetence Honestly flu terrible. I’ll happily wear mask means don’t deal that. issue see local jurisdiction calling face covering allowed stores.  ITYM ""narcissism."" HTH. 😅😅 saw news headline saying Pfizer vaccine good 6 months. clear information coming company. Yes, rapid shift availability expect one-time (or two-time technically) product. 

Every person vaccinated removed demand pool, demand actually decreasing time, ramp supply. 

Many people seem talk like there’s stable demand - that’s case. Definitely going Yankee Stadium summer hate Yankees want share vaccine experience far. 2 days first dose Moderna feeling good. Yesterday significant arm pain slight headache. Today arm pain almost gone feel normal. husband slight arm pain mild headache yesterday, fatigued past 2 days. around 4.1 Million first dose right now: thankful coronavirus; much stable genome. 

and yet already dangerous strains running around now. thats horrifying thought. Yeah big sife effects 
Big time 2 days worth mean, honestly. vaccine cleaner ingredient list McDonald’s hamburger we’re worried long term effects??

Quote day, right there. idea second Moderna shot severe symptoms first shot then? Im genuinely curious, that’s word street. get second shot late April. I've seen enough know arguing pointless. Anyone reading comment encouraged read article see true themselves. headline makes sense. kids vector spreading need vaccinated else cycle keeps going. Frankly adult getting shots point get sick die, excuses ignorance anymore. you’re denying vaccine, set terrible example medical field. call 3 months year, every year? Yeah forgot that. Hopefully, initial round vaccines, need booster least get distribution like flu vaccines able walk pharmacy ask one lines better system schedule them. pure luck able get mine, month half ago things already getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

Also Thank Volunteering! numbers released prove add though, counted vaccines made outside EU bottled getting sent back country use. Right I've already showed makes sense That’s fair! Nurses want respected colleagues tried sell essential oils overpriced thirty-one bags three times last year! 

I try hard judge, walk onto unit monogrammed water bottle says “cute enough stop heart, skilled enough restart it”, can’t help formed opinions medical professional. think aggressive? Oh honey seen aggressive. 

You said:

""it come variants around, **and peoples antibody levels hold up.**""

Hardly strawman reference point. Yeah one still us 3k daily cases mid June, really huge improvement ""worst case scenario"". Reading yesterday kind crushed hope. Really hoping happens. it’s like anybody paying attention requirement anyway. still nearly many people want vaccine ASAP people received least one dose. 

Calling unvaccinated people dipshits time fair. months though, absolutely. don’t believe true.

Sound scientific reasoning Booking appointment problematic significant number elderly without direct relatives internet access (or skills use state sites). may actually wrong. main stream media thrives fear propaganda cue lies. Oddly, explains Covid-19 cases bad countries near China. that, came across article yesterday city (Orlando) surge what’s referred “vaccine breakthrough” cases literally getting covid *after* fully vaccinated, article didn’t make News 6 checked Florida Department Health Volusia County six documented breakthrough cases Sumter County six Lake County 26 cases, according emails county’s spokesperson.

This Orlando alone, nurse article says one family members, also *fully* vaccinated time (2 weeks+ second dose), go hospital symptoms bad.

So pretty odd read article city talking “vaccine breakthrough” cases, hop r/all see post titled claim vaccinated people don’t carry virus. Stays effective LEAST six months. That's part emphasize. Could much longer, know yet. Plus guns! praise jeebus morning go outside pick couple fresh pistols libertree yard! Depressing Almost 100% fall normal, barring unimaginable turn events. feel real, really almost there! know America’s Green Party Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee candidate. Really entertaining individual.

Batshit crazy entertaining Williams mostly stayed Facebook Instagram Covid-19 hit. lockdown, 37-year-old stuck north Texas farm husband, 3-year-old, chickens goats. also cut source income. **Williams sells essential oils multilevel marketing company Utah called Young Living.**

Yea, ok. mask social distancing lockdown. case, I'm really interested arguing type. selfish POS pandemic, pandemic, continue after. post sarcastic. course Europe didn’t beat virus. Yes. Tetanus awful way die, shot give sore arm couple days. mild annoyance tetanus booster nothing compared agony actually getting tetanus. necessarily take long analyze data, need wait enough people pass 6 month mark draw meaningful conclusions. inject participants day, period time, even started 8 months ago, everyone trials 8 month mark. Ha! remember this, terrifying. would deaths doorstep take day two work. think taken whole week sick, maybe ever - generally healthy person consider lucky. already know antibodies wane least 50% 3-4 months.

So expect waning. Reporting efficacy going drop time due waning variants misleading.

But 5% every 3 months healthy people bad. expected like 10-20% 6 months later. efficacy dropped 95 91%, two studies different numbers. caused efficacy staying even going up. true efficacy anywhere 86-99% run study multiple times get anywhere 91 95% result. didn’t order enough. average European busy criticizing US cases last summer US government busy ordering vaccines. Health experts say lot things. mandates everything said, never see candy bar store cigarettes would outlawed. long everyone wants vaccine get one, that's matters. Antivaxers matter. hang around get sick need to, rest country going back normal.  imagine nerd zero risk bias One day April biked completely empty 6th avenue way central park, blowing stoplights. cars. creepy hell, indeed memory I'll never forget, hopefully never get experience again. European nations (like nations general) accept would second (now third) wave, thus invest regulatory &amp; supply urgency rapidly vaccinate 300 million people. Seriously? It’s crazy difference compared Denmark, can’t laid ill, unless you’re ill 90 days year. yes get paid ilness aswell, altho longer period continued illness reduces amount you’re paid.

Even so, average amount days dane sick work around 7 days. Usually one two reasons.

Either viral mutations strains different enough body may recognize virus like flu, risk/benefit ratio makes really simple choice extra safe like tetanus.

Tetanus variations, cure, mortality rate really high, vaccine really downside. get wound might tetanus, get booster? That's logic there. give every 10 years precaution there's real reason assume immunity still. like 30 cases tetanus per year US mostly that's people never vaccine all. likely plenty cases booster given immunity still there. go get stitches Dr orders booster, really extra safe. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah pound Covid ground wherever pops up.  Everyone else lives normally within borders seems report outbreak really quickly needs done 3-4 weeks. 

My friend said last big outbreak rural everyone pissed country farming type kind hid bit let get hand time government stepped whole region go whole process building quarantine centers testing millions millions people shutting things down. friend said city folk pissed country bumpkins (at least that’s put it). 

China weird obvious liars it’s hard think might cracked Covid code without weld people apartment complexes. people seem highly motivated keep living normal life ignoring Covid dealing sharply thoroughly punctuated regional precision. citizens clear picture happen don’t row right direction high incentive avoid that. never stop making fun people thinking vaccines chipped 5g connectivity. mutations didn’t happen “at once” one happened, mutated virus replicated dominant one, mutated again. able one person length time high viral load immunocompromised individual. zero reason cannot happen based mutations work. nothing bodies saying “viruses mutate here!” Like what? would think that? 

Divergent evolution part study. variant developed individual studied hospital matches one variants publicized now, side world. 


No one suggesting variants combined one btw. also don’t think that’s possible. I'm assuming mean least six months here, right?

They probably do, also almost certainly mean ""up to"" well -- reported results, though still spectacularly good, show modest falling-off overall efficacy six-month bracket initially reported results (91.3% vs. 95%, respectively). adjusting role pure dumb luck always plays thing like this, shift would seem imply least participants longer enjoying degree protection six months three. SII never supposed manufacture UK EU

Not true, SII largest vaccine manufacturer world contracted make bulk AZ supply. always plan. 

The UK portion order always contingent interfering domestic supply, SII confirmed case 10m production proceeded, overruled Indian government activating domestic need clause. two weeks up, anyone else also vaccinated indoors without masks without issues, HOWEVER, even ONE person unvaccinated/unknown status, masks required everyone

I understand anyone could utter sentence keep straight face.  Interestingly needlessly aggressive reply. say anything sole marker? Seems straw man argument - hey, makes happy. Korean mothers everywhere today: ""I told so!"" damn first dose certainly gave effects, looking forward #2 better getting virus! MSM Science reporting perpetual train wreck. Nuance context almost always shredded pursuit headline. Ugh. feel man. started job month ago, I'm still trying tread lightly far asking work home (even though literally everyone else company besides me, guy started week me), even though know would productive home day got vaccine health stuff going on, comforts amenities home make huge difference feeling like shit.

I want come whiny, weak, complainy, abusive company's generous, uh, policy clock / out, lunch otherwise. awesome, never job like before. Salary cool time! mind going later days, feel justified coming little later days lol.

Still, trying show appreciation position 10000% because, compared sooooo many jobs there, gig sweet hell. I'm fortunate reached place career possible though. $50k base + commission offers unusual now, commission get six figures. job offer $50k base rescinded stuff bummer, job overlooked got raise first month good job :)

Humblebrags, AWAY! It’s perfect platform conspiracies. Yes worth it. 2 months ago UK experiencing 1500 deaths day Covid. there's less hundred falling. tell, less 50 deaths globally clotting may may connected AZ vaccine. sums pretty straightforward.

The thing people overlook MRNA vaccines requires storage much, much lower temperature AZ ones. Logistically makes harder deploy third world countries. Combined cheaper cost easier storage requirements, AZ vaccine noble effort provide protection less well healed nations.

Whatever going clotting, risk Covid infection health much greater. would wager one day delay vaccination across Europe would cost lives total side-effects. finding scape goats discrediting life saving vaccine order create demand expensive one.

I first jab 2 weeks ago I'm fine. looking forward getting second one getting normality back life summer. Unfortunately high rates vaccine hesitancy amongst black minority populations throughout country, south hippie dippie type, say people anti-vax group come specific subset, weird new age ""crystals truly medicine"" types. tend different anti-GMO (I part subset either) types, least experience hippie circles part of. oof. calm storm. could feel something coming idea. Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan pretty great actually.

The Americas &amp; Europe terrible though, yes. covid vaccine prevent transmission?'

They initially 100% sure knew would protect immunized person, yet *had chance* see kept spreading it. always perfectly front know answer YET advised people continue distance mask *just safe information.* case wrong--because were, vaccinated people free would disaster. *Now* know prevents transmission. telling ""we sure yet actively studying it"" lack information, especially way know prevents transmission studied real world? knew time vaccine safe people get. certain prevents transmission legitimate reason get shot, imo. 

The people get vaccinated, sooner cut routes thing mutate get worse. know that’s difficult thing many people comprehend. Every person faffs around ""I'm gonna wait see"" doctor advised get actively encouraging dangerous mutation. I’m saying hesitant. reality, looking data. I’m favor vaccines, vaccine mandates effectively segregate society based education class race would definitely agree that. think angry people I’ve spawned seem think I’m criticizing vaccine saying it’s bad actually fully support it. think woman every right get whatever reason decides doesn’t want it. people conditioned days think anyone believes thinks differently inherently bad shut immediately, along anyone even supports person. idea Facebook born around gossip (""judging faces""), still doesn’t prevent transmission, hell here?

Exactly. even know even headline. definition, vaccine does. keeps contracting disease. can't contract it, can't spread it. There's always someone there. general immunity lasts long time immune system going magically forget protect covid 6 months vaccinated. don’t know that, I’m suddenly hungry! Well sure, I’d agree vaccines important. isn’t reality live in, however, vaccine passports effectively lead segregation based education, race class ok check texas numbers

michigan tight restrictions texas opened 

what happened? France country definitely talked shit. France people heard from. No, still shit america companies allowed give sick time. health shouldnt left whims profit companies. real country would something protect public health, america really real country point. studies P1 variant? ( Brazil's one ) Well 38.5 fever, headache, chills etc sounds like loaded/bad-faith question, I’ll bite. article explains well. BRAZIL facing biggest health system collapse history, according researchers Brazilian health institute Fiocruz, country records highest number weekly deaths since pandemic began. Meanwhile, Chile forced impose strict new lockdowns cope severe second wave infections, despite mounted one world’s fastest vaccine Brazil recorded 18,164 deaths last week, bringing total 300,000, higher toll country except US. Many country’s intensive care units reached capacity. “The lack medication, materials intensive care beds turning situation chaos,” says Renata Pieratti Bueno, doctor works across three hospitals São Paulo. shortages lack trained personnel causing unnecessary deaths, says. Hmm. don’t think many Roma doctors there. U.K. community leaders liaison people like that, maybe get board way. thing lacking Hungarian authorities like Roma want help. Especially many NP schools 100% acceptance rate online education. People make assumption schools difficult time acknowledge nurses getting “advanced” degrees maintaining full time job. online medical schools. part time medical schools. 
Acknowledging differences important.  Covid deaths hospitalizations plummeting. So, long think they've looking mRNA vaccines SARS coronavirus? I've able find, started back original SARS-CoV 2002 continued MERS 2009. Nobody ever took point human trials need. one, need head start prior research development.

Unless, course, supposing tossed notes first two passes.... care situation also want things go back normal soon enough keep mental health *entirely* collapsing Bleeding injection site, mean don’t give bandaid reason! don’t think I’ve ever felt liquid go vaccine I’ve lol logic private company selling products actually government providing people. Interesting take. Idk man. guess I'm ready shit give hope I've looking for. Ok, glad people want get vaccinated waiting. health districts current eligibility idk update new eligibility. Probably Monday announced earlier week scheduling everyone 1B left waitlist longer day since roughly 30k left. think skipping 1C since it’s weird vague phase dont quote can't really compare based efficacy number lot reasons, 100% effective hospitalization death important thing anyway. funny I'm watching snow Tigers game right poster said smug dick. There's difference. know it. know it. Everyone knows it. poster agreed nurses, would made comment. many Redditors deliberately intellectually dishonest? (That last sentence rhetorical question). trials began summer, yes. doubt started current dosage system, let's say did. 9 months since June, they're likely monitoring post dose 2 since August. 7 months since August data takes analyse.  Like 98% going Pfizer Moderna, Moderna equally effective. cold symptoms 3 days father tested positive last week (he different home family).
Yesterday went get tested got negative.
Is possible covid? never moved fast virus cure before.

The Swine Flu vaccine 7 months also novel virus. Covid worse novel flu pandemics been. long time - outside living memory - since one bad happened. logic unless something made government owned facility made country? label made China made UK pointless.

Good know BMW German anymore. give world 2 vaccines though?  Bi-yearly vaccine? Fuck add study said catching covid gives antibodies 6-8 months that's bought damn propaganda. Frankly, pisses lack rights workers. Damn brainwashing take far longer undo. yearly boosters like flu shot. I've vaccines work (I work NHS UK) they're already talking boosters winter AstraZeneca US trial participant here. got unblinded today (I'm vaxxed)! wonder trial participants added count, happen FDA approval complete? case vaccines? get 4 hours reasonable somehow enough I'm sure would work you. u/aamirislam specified Pfizer specifically though. ripping dipshit population.

Good. need culling stupid people vaccine rollout that, today, turn tsunami. Covid hospitalizations deaths *plumetting*. Whether like not, pandemic coming end. pull funding moves

Under Trump maybe. Something tells Biden purely due optics.

The EU (not Europe) made easy target due ineptitude procurement, rollout leaders casting doubts efficacy vaccines. EU vaccinated criticism. though? Maybe missed name designation, P1 variant? We're mid third wave unvaccinated people ignoring restrictions party. bars 'open' lock inside bars can't leave morning clandestine parties. Makes sick normal become.

And yet trust vaccines wait wait bit see they're safe. People's priorities messed up. odds seem off. Washington recently identified 102 COVID cases 1.23 million fully vaccinated people, like 8 100,000. seen break health district? Fairfax County system, said anything? School teacher parks rec summer director city here. Governed vendors eroded far that's cheaper better quality care medicaid. dammed shame. Abstract

The absurdity statement. us delighted putting antivaxxer garbage decades, might finally social consequences spreading bullshit. Effectively economically sanction antivaxxers? Yes please. I've already pointed selfish, failed acknowledge point.  Well, mean, similar flu. flu bad; vaccine it. going happen since India even halted exports Covax.

The EU given AZ months ago put efforts producing Biontech/Pfizer Europe. Oh meant 18th 19th thanks catching that. health districts sooner others. southern ones may open eligibility northern ones due supply vs demand. know health district flew 1B started 1C announcement whereas fairfax still 1B area (DC metro) mask mandate limitations indoor seating, businesses, etc. bars bar closed individual tables spread out. even wanted belly bar still wait local ordinances change. Nurses physicians different. different levels educations training. depth education basic science research like physicians do. 

It’s derogatory “mean” make note differences. willing drive 90 minutes away urban area likely find one quickly. taking mask fully immune proven can't spread virus selfish. Forcing keep wearing one conditions is. think start batch every 110 days, though. probably start daily every days something. still don’t get US gets JJ vaccines EU gets NOTHING return. even AZ, even approved . Ridiculous. They’re rising, looking ED visit numbers compared hospitalization, least they’re lower back November. looks like back much higher % people went ED hospitalized. May - December rapid testing. stuff normally takes years. Forever? all. Many places already back normal behavior, others summer. rare event alarmingly poor attempt trolling, check incident table GISAID you’d prefer believe me. isn’t 1% either - it’s 1 *case*. get first shot tomorrow 😁 CDC put statements besides one blurb head CDC Twitter?

This crucial issue many people think could something better video sound bite. Six Sigma Black Belt.

LOL! parts Michigan surging relatively low total cases/capita compared parts Midwest. Among states, Michigan #42 cases per capita!

 sure seems like certain percentage population going infected year+ timescale. inevitable. USA lucky, exactly happened Europe. It’s becoming humanitarian crisis. UN seriously look start sending aid  mean agree fronts. Workers need vote progressive people office pro union though. people easily tricked thinking unions bad politicians want make policy communist devils. Bled? mean... didn’t feel liquid go in? Kinda sus unfortunately many selfish. We're close safe return. reason rush selfishness. saw reports ""by April experience (both salaried office job call center agent/supervisor), white collar jobs tend harder train hiring manager involved said training instead hourly workers dedicated trainers training classes white collar manager knows difficult replace/train worker replacing hourly workers regularly expected business usual.

A couple years ago, office new hire whose mother went hospice care less week live month 2 working there. Normally even pto available schedule normal vacation day month 3. manager vp like, questions asked going she'll still job gets back. Manager also fought hr make sure paid time 'we client dinners cost 2 weeks pay.' know, comes back turns excellent employee quickly promoted another person started job time never missed work awful spent like 6 months lingering performance plan awful-worker quit.  sure downvoted. likely scenario. Massively delivering answer question. Who's American values talking about?

Nothing mentioned codified Constitution Bill rights, really ""American Values"" sounds like shit personally like.

That's American Values, that's fucking opinion. Times Washington Post reported issue mix-up coronavirus vaccine material Emergent producing Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca.

If make ingredient JnJ AZ, wonder plant already supplied AZ facilities ingredient. AZ already produced tens millions doses US. Covid deaths hospitalizations literally plummeting. New cases absolutely aren’t “out control” Unfortunately, think smarten people quickly federal government make stuff law. That's love people arguing businesses give PTO. that's true, scared codify law? Well, ain't nearly enough PTO business wants option evaporate cuts bottom line. Federal laws protecting worker rights go lot farther, quickly, hoping US population smartens able unionize company question squashes it. 6 months? Wtf You’re right, misspoke. says second half 2021 approval. yet Moderna testing booster shot, obviously legit concern. might trying stay ahead game prepared. 

And number cases remains high, better chance new super-mutation emerge. We're playing fire letting pandemic smolder countries high vaccination rates. unvaccinated countries, pressure virus evolve super-bug. No, vaccines AVAILABLE everyone. different. amendment specific applies government. That's not.  Bless heart. I'm still taking mask off. people want infected, they're perfectly free stay home take precautions. living rock know protect point.

It's year. I'm done. RemindMe! Awesome, thanks!  1 6 fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations good: also created plenty garbage. astronomical amount, actually. think production shot issues probably extremely unlikely, likely differences people's immune systems, here's article ""History Vaccines"" web note efficacy often measured differently. Sometimes illness, sometimes severe illness, etc. Like chicken pox vaccine reportedly 80-90% effective stopping infections 100% effective preventing severe infections. Also note definitions ""mild"" ""severe"" somewhat subjective.  Take headache relief med. relieves it, probably COVID. doesn't, *could* be. far I’m concerned, study effectively death knell virus. we’ve got variants bag, virus already lost war. live North Dakota, South, opened vaccine everyone days ago, still plenty appointments available, indicates hesitancy. comment linking medicalxpress.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Confusing, saw CNN headline said lasts well six months six months suppose longest Pfizer guarantee. question is, anyone given shot told would likely need another less year? never realistic assume Covid would disappear quickly. one I'm aware J&amp;J phase 3 trial, efficacy pretty similar Brazil US. Ok really wrong use word, retrospect sound utterly stupid get point. first one offered midst pandemic infection levels high course one would take time choice course would want one gives us best possible protection. shouldn’t barred suggesting either, it’s sin point empirical evidence. 

Of course astonishingly bad amount AZ is. think Moderna know market - churn quickly sell high price countries buy proven safer bet potential boosters. can’t tell behind closed doors governments still seriously considering hedging bets worse booster mRNA production ramp much summer. big country (apart maybe India) buy AZ booster, it’s marred much shit already.

It ""necessary"" longer may think. obey CDC guidelines, simple... really rocket science here. Vaccines provide magic shield virus.

They simply train immune system recognize fight virus replicate much cause damage.

Everyone’s immune system slightly different, may produce range response levels.

Vaccines therefore evaluated efficacy. vaccinated cohort unvaccinated cohort size observed period time. 100 unvaccinated found contract virus (or become hospitalized, whatever tested for) 10 vaccinated do, vaccine would considered 90% efficacy (against tested outcome).

So real world, efficacy expected observed, thus vaccinated people get sick! discrimination exactly? treated hostpitals like everyone. Whatever thoughts vaccine are, legally, it’s authorized emergency use.

Think much could improve quality life continuing stop spread many dangerous illnesses, people would vaccinated. asymptomatic people even spread virus? reason sorta like idea, incentivizes people get shot. You’d surprised many people don’t think need vaccine low personal benefit. devil’s advocate risk groups prioritized months now. anyone concerned covid risk point, get vaccine. 14 days? 6 weeks full pay. Americans fooled UK would wait get vaccinated. Currently vaccine roll going brilliantly due federal government making mess it. I'm sure they'll figure (because states currently shoveling huge amounts shit them) right take get vaccinated here. Pretty sure reason US getting vaccines first payed first, didn’t waste time haggling lower price like EU did. sign contract first presumably entitled earliest deliveries.. Export ban not, contracts guiding deliveries don’t get sick days at
My company. PTO (paid time off). Use vacation illness. course NOBODY stays home they’re sick Lol CCP promoters reddit, wanted check It’s shame felt needed clarified :/ thought obvious. Sir... right here...

Found high school dropout pretending he's smart Alrighty, enjoy completely wrong everything then, I'll block read anymore disinformation :) Poverty discrimination. Nothing social investment assistance couldn’t help. universe idea cure polio! Yeah that’s even close said. Jesus Christ talk reading comprehension skills.

That said, I’m shocked took worst possible interpretation may meant. type tends that! Hopefully moon! life work matter important think are, matter are. hit bus tomorrow work without you? move find someone else. Again, part problem.   read like advertisement? hate idea vaccines passports. Totally it. need show live normally, I’ll it. (Short term). reasonable argument “we don’t know vaccinated, could lying “. I’ll drop mask attend concerts Cubs games. (Again, short time. Spring summer). I'm bit skeptical that's real coronavirus, seems plausible. Non Hungary fault lifestyle even worse Hungarians lifestyle lots overweight underactive people smoke worst drugs imagineable. sucks. find new place work? someone tells wear mask social distance others vaccinated, get angry them. living like longer necessary. 

Sick anti-social people enforcing anti-social rules people want live life No...""98% survive"" objective statistic. hell talking about? serious? live country curfew nothing open half year. student cant go chill friends hellish day online classes. fucking living hell. give normal living what? lies inconsistency media. starting become dystopia baffles people like willing accept that. Nah, shitty union. know safe know effective least while, we're middle pandemic. cant believe someone would pass vaccine saves lives they're sure long protection last. boots taste? Hey moron length time said greater 6 months, dumbass? throw numbers year untenable production facilities average person. I’m vaccinated would refuse go two shots associated sickness every 6ish months. Brazil would likely boned regardless, almost certainty used diplomatic relations Americas region mitigate efforts states, including Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, working increase influence region detriment US safety security. OGA coordinated U.S. government agencies strengthen diplomatic ties offer technical humanitarian assistance dissuade countries region accepting aid illintentioned states. Examples include **using OGA’s Health Attaché office persuade Brazil reject Russian COVID-19 vaccine** offering CDC technical assistance lieu Panama accepting offer Cuban doctors. Maybe Cook county, otherwise, way. Illinois huge. Well, since 2 weeks = 1 year, 6 months 13 years That's Denmark rated top 5 happiest places world. phase 3 trial data older six months. Phase 3 began July 27, eight months ago, reviewed first six months here. Btw, masks reduced infections 0.5%. Infections dont equal deaths. Meaning reduction death count 1-3% 5500.
55 - 165 less deaths, theoretically. whole country. 300 Mio. wear masks. According CDC. CDC says ""therefor must keep wearing masks.""... 
Sounds insane me. New Zealand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam lost less 100 people collectively succeeded keeping virus ever gaining foothold borders. China, Australia, Singapore substantial outbreaks acted quickly enough able keep outbreaks either mostly confined certain area (the outbreaks Hubei Melbourne area) isolated population (workers’ dorms).

Japan South Korea succeeded keeping transmission low steady level, don’t think country severe widespread outbreak, contained it, kept virus control vaccination. Many people often thought would case though, Europe last summer India recently.

The lesson learn successful countries need keep virus act quickly possible get rather let spread widely within borders hope control later like US Europe did. transmission widespread good options don’t serious consequences (aside masks aren’t enough own) point leaders either give restrictions public decided stop following you’ll see resurgence. Got first shot yesterday. I’m glad able get Pfizer, hearing good news makes shot even greater. downside sore arm massive headache.  true - 2nd dose Oxford vaccine, given around 2-3 months later gives much better protection longevity immune response.  *good* employer/job US, get benefits - sick time, short long term disability, mental health leave, family leave, etc., half country fall category basically wage slaves. Hi Turtle Expert. 

Given expertise, identify variety turtle found? might want obtain one.

What type studies conducted? 

Do know % effectiveness turtle combating watermelon yet? Exactly. feds would take truckloads vaccines roam neighborhoods looking willing people, could stopped tracks. 20,000 vaccines nothing compared total supply would make huge difference surge is.

The pandemic almost long stay course we're on. Media outlets going disappointed. past decades, damn near every major employer know US shifted ""vacation sick days"" model ""PTO"" model (at least lower tiers workforce) draw sick &amp; vacation time pool. However, still typically restrictions &amp; penalties taking ""unplanned time off"" (i.e. sick days) result punitive measures even termination.

Like you, currently fortunate work situation decent flexibility many regards. Since spent many years subjected punitive systems, immensely appreciative working employer treats workforce humanely. population density? I’d figure Israel whole denser. EU also paid doses advance. Every country paid vaccines advance. fifty states US? Guaranteed law employer can't decide differently whim? unironically. They're hiding numbers. can't see know say. Florida. want clear: They. Are. LYING. Yes still 300m high priority people total (age plus comorbidities plus healthcare workers etc.) remember. 600m doses required them. Everyone becomes eligible where? Lol...

""Hughes acknowledges limited benefits keeping surfaces clean — own, clean surfaces prevent virus spreading campus. says, ""It makes still extremely fearful comfortable. see cleaning team's presence, know, well, worry residence hall classroom lab vouch fact physically saw somebody least dozen times cleaning space.""

Doesn't quote completely invalidate title? Read it’s 91% refusal lol maybe fact vaccines got aithorized emergency use test effects pregnant women would cause nurses mostly female hesitancy whether want risk putting vaccine may cause issues trying kids. cant be. guess youre anti science wont take something who's side effects unknown certain demographic due tested demographic. Reddit filled idiots like people upvoted you. Actually Americans work hours average average Japanese person. US one of, worst, work/life balances entire industrialized world Vaccines football teams - I've never heard anyone ""support"" vaccine life - pretty much job real world best vaccines first one offered. non-expert trying claim vaccine much better others reduce people's confidence vaccines safe effective. 

Moderna, along vaccines, impacted variants - Covid forever variants comes. That's Moderna altering vaccine. 

AZ also updating vaccine later year given out. AZ best manufacturing capacity anyone effective vaccine altered pretty quickly. 

I've heard experts vaccines infectious diseases suggest support policy anyone AZ needs Moderna Pfizer booster - make sense all. Hope american would fucking mind think country wants receive americans vaccinated craziness suspect we’re getting close point start seeing optimization vaccine deliveries vs. vaccines administered. 

Anecdotal, I’m seeing tons appointment availability southern US states rural areas vs rest US. 

It also wouldn’t surprise start see states reallocating doses cities pile less dense areas. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* never 100% vaccine, plus always unable vaccinated making system imperfect article mixes ""ending pandemic"" ""eradicating virus"". pandemic effectively UK Israel. Norway 40s died AZ, covid. No, already resistance. ancestors dying existing vulnerable it. 

A European 1700s teleported Americas birth would vulnerable people there.

All people mild asymptomatic covid exposed prior. went century without vaccine, descendants might that's left, identical virus would ""mild."" Focusing cases begin always little iffy, ""case"" could anything someone showing hospital sick, young healthy person testing positive. Case count driven much kind testing done varies widely.

This even true today vulnerable people vaccinated, relationship ""case"" actual illness even less was. Yet people look case counts equal. Might bit cliche say, something ready closer ever been, try remember one day look back nothing distant memory Smallpox also lacks animal reservoir. Covid several. need vaccinate 7 billion people, animal reservoirs too.

It also took decades eradicate smallpox right medical status, that's private information.


you can't force people put shit inside body, shit good made be, need fear unvaccinated people much. UK Festivalgoers confident, I'm confident. reassurance I've looking for. Hi, already posted Reposts removed. Ok that’s fair difference thanks say bad flu last year lot people know hit nearly hard was, definitely prepared day two. 1st vaccine 40 hours ago - Moderna.

I want scare anyone vaccine, man... Nausea started 24 hours later - 101.9 fever last night feel absolutely frozen. joints ache, especially wrists ankles, eyes burning, I'm wreck.

I've concerned getting second shot. We're pretty sure Covid back March, enough tests available time, never confirmed. mind people keep wearing masks, want get crap wearing one numbers show safe maskless. US UK around around 50%. Israel least 75%. Europe probably 20-50% range. South America.

Australia 0%. rules Germany currently ?

In England schools went back couple weeks ago University students remote taught possible. essential shops open. 

We meet 6 people outside restricted travel within England. 

Next pubs able open outside 2 weeks time ! mean, can. Today diva day. act part party. hope things get better ASAP. long dealing long covid? City Chicago residents might actually stop looking noses making snide comments Indiana... nah, probably not. HEY HEY, We’re monkeys... Well, made call AZ dangerous give 60 year old got got high risk way. 

The Biontech vaccine shown save humans question mixing vaccines risk effectivness. 

So mRNA vaccine work booster AZ would mean need another Biontech shot.

Since follow assumption AZ advisable 60 year old people need get fully vaccinated risky get vaccine clear require booster Biontech vaccine, makes sense. paid money taken responsibility manufacturing, point prioritised citizens. mean normal non priority groups double fucked . knew likely get vaccine year almost certain . want victim? No.

But offered AZ shot today would take it? heartbeat. Even worst case scenario, believe read 1 125k developing blood clots, would still take it. chances severe Covid significantly higher clots shot. Well mental illnesses contagious start with.

There actually lot precedent requiring people immunized vaccinated engaging certain activities, like required kids go school many areas, certain jobs certain international travel. personally see slippery slope. need checked diabetes schizophrenia contagious, need checked dangerous contagious diseases. Well, imagine would happen Canada, USA, Mexico Central America Caribbean tried negotiate vaccines group per capita distribution. 

What EU save lives people poorest countries expense lives people richest countries (Germany, France) tried negotiate individual deal EU told stop.

Sure, Greeks happy end results doubt lead pro-nationalist parties wealthy countries gain power using rhetoric EU chose sacrifice lives Germans, French, etc...(and wrong). 

Dark times ahead.  Ill one say it. care others lives enough mask FLU season.

Yes Ill mask covid, tell mask stop damages flu, Ill tell pound sand. Ill stand statement till last day. 

Your logic depends assuming general quality life worth less small number lives real though, clean Reddit profile you’re gonna post wanna go school, wanna go school for, etc... people admissions really look stuff.

There's way reddit account traced back short subpoena lmao. highly doubt reddit give information bc college wanted find shitting administration, ain't making bomb threats anything. Stay safe good luck, seriously sympathize y’all Zoom schoolers.

Thanks, found 5 minutes ago college planning primarily person classes next year, good day. vastly underestimating scale effort required eradicate virus. 

Pretty disrespectful call smallpox programme fannying about. took unprecedented efforts decades work.

Covid added issue several animal reservoirs makes eradication really difficult. Smallpox relative unique animal reservoir hope case gets done even faster. I'm supposed study Norway August rising cases Norway stopped processing visa.(I live U.S) research said know protects least 6 months, six months. possible suppose efficacy drops cliff month 7, know seem like probable scenario know.

As syncope, often light-headedness dealing injections? I've found applied muscle tension helpful start feeling lightheaded. like AZ vaccine total unknown guess risks are. given millions people worldwide, even assume blood clots 100% directly caused vaccine (which extremely big assumption still, considering they're appearing countries), risks still tiny. 
 
So still makes sense say tiny risk suddenly far bigger worry randomly something *totally* untested unproven millions people. That's objectively illogical. need provide serious justification want look even slightly reasonable. Sounds pretty American me! MoDeRnA?  free refuse vaccine, concert venues, sports stadiums, music festivals free refuse entry insist menace public health. already started socialize pretty normally people know vaccinated. everyone vaccinated tell going behave completely normally.

Whether carries public places depends local ordinances businesses operate. wear masks, distance, stay away public places even vaccinated makes absolutely sense me. We’ve worried much death we’ve forgotten live. include children statement ability access? technically everyone approved [Here original press  “Mister know date G6 signal update comes out”/s Even BMI smoking requirements opened almost everyone. Everyone 1 brothers family least shot point P1 variant keep hearing about? new one? Would willing one victims? choose one vaccines, possible, AZ one reviewed closely? change fact Astrazeneca signed contract EU delivering it.

This true. AZ signed contract make best effort, they've making best efforts. explicitly protects company delays long they've that. sort problems plagued newly created lines EU also existed UK's, difference UK acted sooner opportunity iron problems earlier. AZ taking EU's money making vaccines countries. Virtually every adult know vaccinated, enough vague health conditions employments loopholes, truth ask questions besides confirm appointment. easy enough check one boxes random make appointment. Basically honor system. mean one health conditions ""overweight"" probably 40% population statistically.

In opinion category made sense age like 65+ easiest check likely relevant, get ""essential workers"" that, probably people categories pointless. Thank although effect cumulative disease transmission reduction. think elimination near elimination quite possible hoping would Moderna have, started clinical trial variant get rush would hate one people taking still figuring does. Ill getting one late 2022 probably even still need it.

Yes know wont allowed go concerts. least Facebook occasionally good posts it. I’ve yet see something Twitter wasn’t someone complaining. Personally, still hope society. Can’t say people elect run though. FWIW, friend Brazilian told he's scared drive hospital beds available gets serious accident. said shots protect least 6 months, don’t know long yet.

As rest, talk doctor. Lol 5G vaccine makes sense release patent people make free

Unless lying need market worthless shot reaction 9/11 way top never used example justify changing way life. reading philisophy book end 19th century author already lenghty mentionned American overworking culture spreading Europe corrupting old continent.

He thought greek heritage, people Europe higher form entertainement free time work obsseded people. exemple scientific philisophic debates, meditation art improving culture rather instaneous pleasure basic entertainment doesn’t devellop person.

Quite interesting read seeing overworking glorified worldwide seen normal thing seen american probleme century ago.

Also less working lockdown led people improve skills themeselves instead mind-numbing leisure tired work Sounds like didn’t hydrate eat enough afterwards anxiety. bad. I’m scheduled get j&amp;j vaccine tomorrow I’m worked nervous don’t know I’ll go it. I’m terrified Infinite months 5g data plan free?! Works me! /s likely they’re monkeying w numbers keep fear sell vaxx. doom on. Businesses let get dirty looks comments employees people. businesses open all.

I saying agree frankly skeptical whole mask thing begin with. local mandates part business rules social norms wear one. Ya said didn’t relax arm lol. definitely lot stopped quickly.  bruh 2 per year then, 2 shots per dose?....jesus...Hey I'll that's fine dang...flu shot even much pointiness. Cool, thanks! That’s figured. Wasn’t nervous curious. Thanks! uncivil, lot comments removed. 

For real though, clean Reddit profile you’re gonna post wanna go school, wanna go school for, etc... people admissions really look stuff. Stay safe good luck, seriously sympathize y’all Zoom schoolers.  Yeah, that’s bubonic plague Spanish flu still raging day, right?  number deaths really comparable though (300 70 million compared 3000 210 million) Silently organize every coworker get shot time? That's absolutely sad terrible.

Also, tagged Europe? Brazil South America. Public Health England's report end February. One dose Pfizer 72% effective symptomatic disease people 70. increase second dose, lower CDC's recent study health workers 80% effective one dose. good, data inconsistent moment claiming Pfizer eradicate COVID unrealistic. think areas date actually closer 5/5. Right pace 70% 5/15. Many peoples seconds doses right around Memorial Day. without rate speeding will. Overly cautious yes June, first holiday July, vast majority feel safe 1 dose + 2 weeks Memorial Day. Regardless let’s enjoy summer! Good use TBH. Also, using dollars develop manufacture Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna Novavax gives world good backup Aztrazeneca disaster 6 months???  good grief so? Michigan state distinct new wave point. UK variant affect vaccine effectiveness. us, another wave come. Checkin Silicon Valley here. gf make $80k combined taxes. pay $1900/mo bedroom house, 3 housemates didn't. said could April 12th, would surprised still case. Yep happened first dose Pfizer. Got felt like beginning panic attack right shot, 15 minute period good calmed down. I've never reaction shot think caught moment happening once. First Pfizer shot &amp; syncope

Got first Pfizer shot caused syncope taken hospital. Debating could use drug like medics gave me, offset autonomic nervous response, skip getting 2nd shot. read vaccinations prevent sickness 6 months anyway. know recommend get 2nd shot I'm going thru again. thoughts re: situation?

Thanks. really hope keep everything closed dumbass boomers read Facebook post says vaccines Satan whatever. German government already asked EU commission negotiate deal Sputnik questionable mention worthy supplies get enough Pfizer-BioNTech + Moderna everyone. Supplying EU different beast supplying small countries like Serbia Hungary. Good Yeah, SEIU 1199 blessing. Got 3/4 masters covered union. Best protections. wish unions argument narrow. It’s like immune systems evolved thousands years thrive densely packed, urban environments poor air ventilation. can’t expose enough pathogens die plague. wouldn’t use tools available us limit exposure pathogens spread mutate across world matter weeks? heck astra zeneca displayed like lethal injection 60? always want data give older peopel? heck tell doesnt get extremly rare bloos clogs too? whole uk giving az jabs old young whatever germany 65 60 what? Soon need excatly 63 years 100 days 10 hours 14 minutes 34 seconds old excactly jab otherwise instnatly turn blood nutella die?

I mean wtf professors scientists whatever cant make point. Thats ridicolous. war without casualties war virus. 9 deaths 2.2 million jabs getting maybe 10 million (until pushed market far better biontech due new factory) around 45 deaths treatment less 20 deaths compare 100+ covid deaths every day facing 1000 2000 deaths third wave dont even notice 20 astra zeneca deaths.

Its disgrace!!!!!!!! False. Pollution reason wear masks. matter. Cold flu season thing. Masks work stop those. Guess don’t care others lives. Even people get dose 1 Memorial Day, there's 3-4 weeks dose 2 2 weeks fully kick in. that'd closer July 4th. dude, bad look. STEM major accomplishment, looks post history you’re still high school anyway.

I never said was, needed actual education, I'm going college next year one, sue wanting take shit high school. Besides, guy one taunting zoom school called salty fuck, nothing said malicious. actually looking something transmutes everything so, know, anyone shot Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan _especially_ Illinois neighbors:

We love you. You’re welcome. Quit hatin’. offer online school alternative schools never closed. Schools essential sure isn’t? People fannied around smallpox ages global campaign like right covid. 

I think future would look back window could got rid didn’t. It’s bullshit reason. sure guys, absolutely appalled took CDC long enough realize stuff like this. common sense now. whole point vaccine prevent people getting sick prevent spread within population. Now, carrying virus part (being asymptomatic carrier) huge deserves recognition. Great work scientists!

&amp;#x200B;

For downvote me, delusional choice, bad guys. sucks im glad caught Honestly think intentional misleading half equation. Many journalists come upper middle class highly educated, time paid little live precariously expats major cities. engenders constant anxiety them—I bet many people writing, editing, commissioning articles (who would highly doubt could even define basic biological concepts let alone know anything virology) generally believe even vaccination they’ll contract exotic variant die (or kill someone else) FINALLY one? get Moderna/Pfizer get two shots? get vaccinated first day I'm eligible, I'll somewhat protected two weeks. fully protected while

That's current data seems suggest.

You're 75% 80% protected weeks first shot Pfizer, modern thinking based research Israel UK. second shot bumps immunity around 90% 95% likely make last longer.

I vaccinated 13 days ago, I'm going crazy yet (as would reckless, plus state high rate COVID spread), generally pretty sure pretty much good point. friend mine fully vaccinated tested positive. you’re probably good, gotta look mean be, guys crushing vaccine rollout I’ll probably wear one public transportation cold flu season. republicans everything gain governor ""failing"". really anti constitutional impeach. side anti maskers/death ignore spirit law dismiss reality idiocy bit confused. got second Moderna shot last Thursday. planning go friend Saturday outdoor bar. safe no? friend already infected. see Fauci double masking time CDC director meltdown rising cases I’m like point getting vaccinated then? I'm hoping none bottled done initial QA. that's case, may big bit sounds like, since bottling rate limiting step. Oklahoma. I've giving shots various health department sites since mid February. last week many open appointments filled. Worked event today supposed 30k. cut half hoped 15k. 5k showed up. one import. narrative childish. far Americans liars. Washington state DOH investigating 102 breakthrough cases including 2 deaths 8 hospitalizations. great Saturday Night Live. Typical conservative though - take seriously directly impacts someone care about. universal rule. general tendency.

And may deadly contagious.

Infectivity terms COVID far dangerous increase. saw article - increasing lethality killed far less people increasing infectivity, mathematically. say we're ""well"" territory yet.  We're still increasing. Poor Brazil. look good them. Ok great. need 30 major economies relevant. i'm interested, dm link? Im sorry hear that, truly need come contact certain number virus particles get infected. vaccinated someone coughs you, would enough infect vaccinated. since infected, cough someone else, number virus particles transmit lower since virus landed get transmitted cough Yeah, doesn’t support one person contributing one variant population. new variant marginally different one transferred essentially same. Even worse considering switched bi weekly testing vaccinated people. it’s twice week both. cuz know... pandemic lol @ noob Well something kept roommates getting immunity part since one got weeks tested positive someone else. know, sucks guys, keep next 2 months, summer comes, everyone vaccinated wants vaccinated, throw stupid masks away, stupid, spread virus close done this! MI exceed wave shit us fall. I’m guessing big one. One articles regarding plasma, others weren't.

It's enough plausible, given information hand. definitely enough show need keep immunocompromised catching COVID, sake sake everyone. separate ""small county framework"" alternate case assessment measures accommodate this. Man nickel... Strange, maybe flight full. Agree PR show anyway. nice getting good seat without paying it. restricted access places one chooses vaccinated anyway punishment. It’s certainly consequence actions means punishment. People think it’s punishment probably get therapy they’re taking things way personally. told mom find nearest county voted strongest favor republicans. found 43 available vaccine appointments traveling extra 7 miles way. thats horrible great, vaccines confer immunity? vaccines work?

If so, then...

: shocked_pikachu [Has anyone done Agreed

The CDC needs set goal line ""masking stopped state x percentage people given least one shot reached"" they've admitted vaccines block transmission chances 4th lockdown happening sometime future UK? bodily autonomy. refuse vaccine. Nobody stopping refusing, would directly oppose forced vaccination.

However, society refuse interact them, right. That's vaccine passport - way us protect people refuse vaccinate protect rest us. mean brings us closer herd immunity, I'm it

They're getting immunity hard way. 80% general adult population vaccinated. nearly year ago, criticisms comments weakness study. Meanwhile vaccinated nurses nursing home don’t wear masks recently resulted couple covid cases. 

Joy. Holy smokes Batman ! Well doesn’t prove immunocompromised people multiple mutation show immunocompromised people allow holding variants system, therefore dominant variant population tend stronger. 

Also study specifically transferring plasma one person another experimental treatment could mess variant population person. found hard way It’s actually Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. German company BioNTech developed vaccine. Pfizer handled manufacturing regulatory approval. put cargo instead? I’d much prefer sit next big box sweaty human. Currently problem children. aren’t eligible vaccinations yet small percentage get ill die COVID. vaccinate kids, antivaxers everyone’s problem. reason incredibly stupid warnings certain items...liability issues. wearing shirt thing injecting foreign substances body?

You're right, not. person wearing shirt harm anyone, someone else walking around unvaccinated could definitely. around close personal contact someone covid. get vaccine negative PCR test, least 10 days without symptoms. Otherwise, putting everyone come contact risk. want expose family members either; possible, visit outdoors, distanced fully/properly masked know sick. Except kill can’t vaccinated medical reasons. Everyone soldier war, otherwise breathing alive soldier enemy. Oh man. Stay safe! may already know this, dispel stuff maybe give arguments mom:

Vaccines ""change code"".

DNA mRNA separate.

DNA cell nucleus.

mRNA goes cell ribosomes, used transcribed amino acids.

There absolutely way one modify other.

mRNA literally stands ""messenger RNA"" - used send messages ribosomes, tell proteins make.  confirm, wife works healthcare vaccinated months ago, sick covid. need hospitalization sick, sick. received first shot 2 days exposed. 9 days I'm still covid free, instructed contact tracer quarantine 14 days none less. say 100% people receive mRNA vaccines? right non issue. Otherwise could sentencing innocent bystanders death. problem ability keep going create variants might beat vaccines. Absolutely, threat 0, basically 0. tell now. 10 years ago? reminds something manager said first corporate job colkege: ""you may dumbass moments, dumbassery bad people's dumbassery"" Money. There’s much stress placed government reopen. vaccine talking here? flew spirit less 2 weeks ago entire plane full. seat going stop infection. sounds like someone case mondays Haven’t heard years. herald whole whacky Tea Party thing, causes wacky people wear masks get vaccinated, good thing. Whatever. ""Richards! supposed mix little saline! using?""

"".... vodka..... kind look same...."" ""blimp radar"" hilarious sequence words day better read it.  Except there’s always chance they’ll let virus mutate something makes vaccines useless.... Probably won’t instituted, ever are, couple months anybody get easily Pointing poll done 3,000 doctors, 95% vaccinated might shut up.

Seriously though, know we're going get though. Restrictions flights/trains, businesses, etc possible solutions Exactly !!! Let let be. That’s beyond frustrating. mRNA concern doesn’t find somewhere give J&amp;J vaccine? It’s made traditional way. thought supposed verified nearly 1 billion people injected 😐 I've heard Doctor nurses got vaccine shots. heard news first year recorded history one died flu, Washington State. 

And that's I'm still going keep wearing mask, whenever I'm public around bunch people, even over. Exactly. exactly X amount interacting trigger catastrophe. problem we're quite sure X restrictions keep us it. know start approaching X, pull back. definitely approach it.

You legitimately disagree CDC's recommendations large scale basic science top quality. Places masks restrictions better. Whether necessary end may never know sure. Already got Pfizer ever was. Take guns, force vaccine , yup, fun sun summer 2021! Who? Again, consult doctor. standard guidance immunocompromised individuals regarding vaccine, many get safely. got mine 4 hours ago. shall see! idea Sarah Palin still relevant. Isn’t mathematics game point? many weeks vaccinations drop r one. Going Israel, that’s two half weeks happens. 

How much wave possibly amount time? I'm sure live state opened yesterday SO's age group got appointment today next week county. hope it'll quick easy turn. That's statistics work got J&amp;J city-run site Lincoln Park today. sure going forward though, sorry! ""Vaccine passports"" remotely comparable travel passports, aside name. Needing document participate society lot different needing one travel countries. requiring ID vote racist, requiring proof vaccination buy groceries definitely sort discrimination. think we're talking lot long-term things going happen vaccines amazing allow us get away living fully normal old normal lifestyle is. use excuse negate MAJORITY people, undemocratic authoritarian shit. Honestly, still undersells well Wisconsin doing. [Full data anyone curious highlights:

- 38% people 16 least one dose

- 75.3% people 65 least one dose

- 58.4% people 65 doses

- Dane County, second populous county state home capitol UW-Madison 38.2% overall rate 89% people over. give shit people took steps protect them

""That's horrible!"" limiting factor fast vaccinate people, alternative. not, removing AZ slowing vaccination process consequences too. Keep mind lot anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, lockdown denying COVID denying people come sub continue push disinformation. disinformation campaigners continue try push narrative need stop listening experts. They've working overtime discredit public health officials country. Everything say false. Fauci CDC right everything date, provide substantial relief people unsure. 

Get vaccinated soon can, sooner, put whole thing behind us. Salk 2  Fired, something more. Probably argued responsibilities someone die. would argue never best course action get infected, matter works immunologically nothing ever safe things always work cleanly practice theory.

While virus would provide ""well rounded"" response, reason think yet response necessary since vaccine induced response enough prevent infection. addition based new CDC data, people vaccinated protected infection symptoms meaning virus cleared antibodies true activation immune response. best case vaccines means additional response complete virus.

There's reason think would severe illness serum antibodies wane, would likely opposite. Even serum titers drop memory cells remain respond rapidly infection limit viral replication

There honestly way predict long immunity last, keep waiting data gets reported manufacturers time goes on. Surely paraplegic grandmother must form caretaker lmao Pfizer Moderna alone giving US enough doses fully vaccinate 250 million Americans July. news sucks it’s big grand scheme NJ, seemed like hospitals giving Pfizer state-run sites Moderna.

The healthcare workers know mostly got Pfizer, parents, sister, friends/family got Moderna. also Novavax trial. Pfizer, friend's kid recruited us posting local mom's board. know maybe 10 families participating. trial in, read Novavax starting trial filled screening question thing website. linked local clinical trial site go appts. CDC Director: I'M SCARED! IMPENDING DOOM COMING!

Also CDC Director: get vaccinated, good. Don’t forget need wait week two second dose fully vaccinated! doesn’t immediately happen. Stay safe party away :) NY app prove vaccinated (or recently tested negative) allowed sporting events...where privilege staying socially distanced wearing mask...I think bit late worried right... keep repeating this?

At best, people preferring cautious ya know, half million dead Americans you. seen single post claims bullshit though.

These ""ReDdiToRs NeVeR WaNt OpEn uP"" posts lazy horseshit ways shut legit conversation, frankly really transparent. Doesn’t excuse using 10s thousands doses already have. Would able save hundreds lives - look sharply deaths came uk Wow. 15 millions. problem media talks absolutes. 

With covid, there's always chance. Always. link public spreadsheet miles miles daily vaccine data it, interested. Fun play around with. Lately Fauci impression that, even completed vaccination effort, Americans willing sacrifice livelihoods mental health children completely eradicate virus whose lethality vaccines bring level seasonal flu.

At risk sounding like negative nancy, worst, licker polish, American society given year time people given way people talk 'resist' (anti-lockdown protests, example), clear Americans willing tolerate years.

Lets say people stop tolerating it, do? g0vernment says close shops. force open? create new country? best, civil disorder resolve within days.

People always say ""This'll it, (insert date) longer care"" proceed never meet deadline. People said Christmas, would give up. Judging nationwide compliance fairly ok lockdown areas, clearly case. people say summer 'is it', arbitrarily extend deadlines government tells so, likewise, subreddit.

If government decides go whole whog shutdown entirety 2022, disobey it, except online fringe anti-lockdown groups always condemned. Unlikely. J&amp;J prioritized groups can’t get Moderna Pfizer vaccines due logistics issues. Lol yeah, virus tho one job, J&amp;J. One job. shitty side manufacturing company (Emergent Biosolutions Baltimore, MD) messed vaccine doses also manufacturing site AZ vaccine well. J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing delayed, AZ one affected well regulators give go ahead site. agree many ideas, even later pulled back. crosshairs FBI Nation Islam. upper middle class white woman? seroconversion rates almost 100% literally 100% vaccines I've seen questioned case Sinopharm's vaccine, sense really need worry all. Keep expectations high still disappointed vaccines. 2020 real breakthrough year medical technology, especially vaccine technology change vaccines forever.

Yes, problem ultimately lies lack enforcement. big true. reality true, since vaccines moderate -not full- efficiency. leaders problem wearing masks.

Probably good sign remove mask mandates maybe make much difference. WRONG wildly assuming vaccines 100% effective.

One would need 65, BMI &lt; 25, smoke, myriad common conditions including high blood pressure, unemoployed (pretty much employed person sneak given vague categories are).

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, nobody checks. nice, good know!

Problem is, know personally 1 person got basically antibodies even getting 2 shots. astrazeneca. read comment reddit person experience sinopharm's.

A friend told several cases health care people (at least 4) got antibodies need get shot again.

These probably fringe cases, we've waiting lot, I'm trying manage expectations properly advice family. Nah im good. forced wear mask 107 degree heat absolutely brutal. soon get vaccinated im done Gonna stock bungled 15 million doses Many us, included, adament that.

Well course would it, hundreds posts trump's subreddit. pretty funny actually correct information getting downvoted. Saw articles saying Baker plans lift mandate knows :/ read article determine transmission doesn’t happen? also regularly test families? Well shit. European closures killing portfolio. cut shit out? probably beyond scope would need studied guess worth thinking about. also dumb question:

Does mean best course action individual hoping avoid severe illness COVID-19 would get vaccinated become infected virus antibodies vaccine wane develop robust cell response future infections ensuring first true infection would relatively mild presence antibodies? 

Does also mean people presently completely naive SARS-CoV-2 receiving vaccine likely setting bout severe illness encounter virus long antibody titers certain level? 

Also, bode long-term immunity considering we're going 8 months since first phase 3 trial vaccine started US seen data effect people losing protection time? hard understand people still vaccinated. 10 million though?

A study Wales found 0 sample size 400,000. Here's news J&amp;J transmission: Arguing state best like arguing who’s smartest D- student class. Nowhere US came looking good. Indeed screwed batch 15 mil  Every anti-masker waiting stupid fucking article. Get ready see Facebook... Science liar sometimes. Honestly think Theranos saga contributed skepticism well. 2020 year forgot 100 year science. 

They agenda knows 100 years science says immune system keep safe years “experts” sayings could 1 months something wrong. Exactly. still people think someone walking outside without mask means they're handing death sentences. people genuinely think everyone needs wear masks outside homes whether outside even vaccination.  happened? Goddammit, signed one. know lot people got Moderna. Everyone know got vaccinated pharmacy, urgent care, smaller vaccination site got Moderna. mass vaccination sites big hospitals mostly Pfizer. sign J&amp;J LA county?

Sigh. fucking course. Title bit clickbaity, 3 people get sick although way less 161 people got sick without vaccine... Agree first mitigation guess there’s harm channeling AZ vaccine lower risk groups long we’re clear risk small avoid undermining effectiveness vaccine.

On second point though lockdown causes suffering probably worse low rates clotting may may exist terms mental health, poverty etc.

I guess willing take small risk sake getting vaccinated reduce spread community. fortunate second AZ dose two weeks! That's risk several orders magnitude higher estimate blood clots AZ well. not, virus endemic. get regular boosters variants could seen coming? think scrutiny applied official regulators receiving pressure national level actors, prime swamp-land sell you!


I'm definitely saying right, happening wheter like not. finding now, considering vaccine passports? Cause said proof stop transmission infection. would mandate it?

Also happens next year variants change? pharma reprogram vaccine gladly sell us another dose? Although cost more. happen every year that's endemic.

And vaccine passports multiple stamps variant specific vaccine. Gotta catch welcome make suggestion quite frankly go fuck itself

Even worse, lot people Reddit know talking about, pretend don't. Reduced atoms likely death rate Brazil caused surge cases, hospitals bein overwhelmed. also mean less people get tested, obscure actual IFR.

In December/January originally reported British variant could 30% lethal. days ago Dutch government reported case. increase number death likely caused surge cases.

The new variant Brazil may issue. infectious, actually deadly. know months.

It noted Brazil seeing increase death among younger population. could alarming, may result higher death rate. Speaking big numbers, even 1:50k would die AZ would minor blip, something similar usual summer holiday death numbers traffic. Overall, doubt 49999 immunized people would save thousands transmissions, hospitalizations deaths.

However, individual level, would asking perfectly healthy people really low chances suffering serious covid simply die common good. see c de justified multiple alternatives require sacrifice:

* Give AZ population better risk/reward ratio
* Compensate redirection direct skip AZ measures (lockdown, etc)

As politician, would weight numbers maybe decide go AZ matter what. all, much worse trade offs taken already refusing lock (in time all).

As individual citizen, though, willing risk life common good options may hurt economically instead. Rite Aid succeeded first time tried this. pleasantly surprised sure! Wearing mask nothing. I'm vaccinated still wear it. Like MMR vaccine 1/25000 causing thrombocytopenia still widely used (as state Chicago May 1st ugh. post vax, non obvious death/issue counts.

Anyone? really need know one best job possible declares best job job completely. thing happening Chile Latinamerica. EU contracted two production sites UK. 

Both failed deliver single vaccine. Maybe look couple countries seeing issue much others. high levels infectivity rising cases, would avoid crowded indoor areas even vaccination.

Why? trial. posted right away couple different comments gotten responses.. wanted see anyone seen anything similar, cause know getting covid 2 weeks getting shots basically unheard of. 

Just got back reddit now, thanks response. already know two people fully vaccinated got covid regular flu killed people deaths countries WW2. shut whole world that? worse war, bro. Lol 

Look bully barging try make fun random internet.

Do feel good yourself?

Does pee-pee look bigger mirror post shit like this? Assuming slowdown, 50% fully vaccinated (going CDC definition 2 weeks final dose) mid-June. We're vaccinating 1.6 million first doses per day (7 day average) already 100m. 

Our current pace would put us May 10th-ish 50% getting first dose. Pfizer J&amp;J would fully vaccinated June 15, anyone gets J&amp;J 3 weeks make Moderna stragglers takes another week complete vaccination. sounds far high.

According this, year olds IFR 0.4%, line estimates seen. 50 year olds closer 0.2-0.3% IFR 1%.  According CDC 33 deaths associated MIS-C.  heavy 5'5"" feet arent dangling wind? One person many vaccinated? big deal all, sounds like outlier, going vaccine medication. “not problem”  necessarily blame them. easy task bet wrong horse, suddenly 10 months behind. wear mask car? Vaccines longer go brrrr  That's okay. hard feelings.

But way, ""that's case"" much better argument ""nuh-uh"". least Georgia, mass vaccination sites give Pfizer. Kroger mostly Moderna.  No, first shot help him. 

His immune system needs learn recognize fight virus, whether it’s learning real virus facsimiles constitute vaccine, won’t faster. trying say comments got removed! 

We need clear concise messaging CDC. like they’re putting information America needs plain English bullet points. Heck, make tiktok. Whatever gets message out!  Yeah, government knows telling truth ""your need pointless bullshit apes follow moves"" going go well since take inconvenience ""set good example"" pointless, would rather lie act like still need them. No, all. tiny minority people, people already deal increased risk immune compromised. Sometimes life harder people. people choose get vaccinated, accepted risk along unvaccinated people. Coronavirus isn’t communicable disease there, immune compromised people deal others well. can’t force people undergo unwanted medical procedure behalf tiny minority people.

And jump anti vaccine. vaccine cheerleader entire social circle since thing started, registered vaccine state right now. believe 40 group becomes eligible Monday, hopefully get first shot 1-2 weeks. really can't educate majority them, literally brainwashed. better chance convincing die hard baptist catholic become atheist.  information right infront refuse see it. issue people invested idea can't accept wrong. friends anti vax losing battle even attempt conversation.

No, can't vaccinate mammals, human infections mutate address those. can't stop vectors, try tackle dangerous one? would increase risk? 
For people general catch COVID, symptomatic likely spread.

Since you’re partially vaccinated, you’re less likely become infected all, even likely less symptomatic.

So it’s clear much less risk! AZ high hopes Don’t douchebag maybe actually read said. said “everyone access” means everybody get it, fuck masks. don’t vax yet. Lol....nice I'd gladly get vaccine FDA approval 5 years studies showing long term side effects

Is thought COVID? Many vaccines 5 years data go market, yet hear type talk often now, hear anyone mention things like flu vaccine prior COVID, reformulated every year also new vaccine go market every years without 5 years studies.

Also, someone eats boogers probably worrying long term side effects COVID vaccine. take yearly flu shots assume? Dunno maybe that’s tell extra context, due demand increasing. would opened earlier demand there. I'm confused.

End day vaccines help us fight covid save lives regardless efficiency numbers may be. Remember yes whilst efficiency numbers may vary one thing vaccines common trials none vaccinated people needed hospitlisation died. Showing even unlucky get symptoms vaccines still save life mean much mild case covid without vaccine. ultimately thats key bit here. Vaccines stopping getting covid also meaning even get hopefully alot milder.

Pfizer also several months given t9 far people hence getting alot real world data it. patient soon enough J&amp;J used across world US we'll good real world data coming J&amp;J soon enough 

And put perspective. millions people around world waiting patiently get vaccinated date sight yet protected covid year started affecting lives. incredible. would interesting find scale production. know could single batch. Hard judge without knowing production quantities/scale. honored Lol, absolutely get Pfizer Moderna vaccine /s.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*Reference follow German news mask scandal there. Europe basically planning rolling lockdowns forever? That's seriously end game now? seems insane. science also shows coronaviruses cause common cold reinfection common. far appears one reinfection possible it’s super common. data would irresponsible scientists say wasn’t possible. Even say certain natural immunity lasts least year. one year ago large numbers cases China, Italy, NYC. still don’t huge sample size long. 0% chance  Well someone going fucking fired cough cough plant manager cough cough responsible overseeing quality control this. reasoning society shouldn’t rules people disobey them, you’re one them. age well Ah cool. Still, today insanely late game “But it’s bad flu” - stupid shit heard last year. CDC says two weeks. Yeah, actual journalistic quality Nature Press definitely suffered pandemic. I’ve never seen stray inaccuracy. Aaah got it. 

Reason felt compelled put correction literally every time someone praises J&amp;J, inevitably dozen posters chiming due EU company blah de blah blah. US always brought talking countries? dont want people think skip second shot. label fully vaccinated 2nd shot. 

The truth is, almost fully protected 2 weeks first shot. want 2nd shot thats trails ran assumed 2nd shot gives long term protection need Says who? fact US lead world vaccine distribution Biden took office. lead world plan place? really believe that. Operation warp speed did/is getting vaccines arms. Trump might sucked, US funded/secured got vaccines arms better rest world administration (minus couple small countries) know someone genuinely believes everyone Asia wearing mask 24/7 times prior 2020.  Still 100% effective keeping dying hospital really still huge loss. U.S follow suit, we're really stupid. That's supremely shitty. Hope gets sense smell back normal provide sources here? I'd rather people get shot, shot. know isn’t entirely rational, hesitancy young children receiving vaccines. It’s mRNA thing. I’d prefer lot long-term data, guess.

I received first dose Pfizer shot. kids ages 5 7 date vaccinations. I’m anti-vaccine means. I’m sure explain position. indication COVID *would* impact fertility. could say “We don’t know _____ impacted” anything. app could give false confidence, provinces chose it. covid, updating app phone even mind initially. think BC really good job though, provinces maybe not. makes ironic mistake dumb one. :( “Just chill bro, we’re trying rule others, big deal”

Fuck. You.  copied text took article, opinionated. actual filed (and easily accessible) opinion. know read copied pasted straight State Journal - quote different. read it, read it, accepted fact thing mattered. mention super power feeling vaccinated. effects don’t kick 2 weeks Pfizer least . immigrating great free USA couple decades ago family proof multiple vaccinations and, remember right, test AIDS.

Here, decided go college also asked vaccination proof accepting me.

How different? Yeah, recently conversation healthcare professional talking variants. convinced next variant would ""kill us all."" mean, possibility, means likely one. 

Thank goodness! kinda shot?

I see there. Zika negatively impact fertility and, importantly, entirely unrelated virus. seem relatively confident make May. dude Yes. Absolutely. Someone AZ headquarters almost certainly saying ""Hold Beer"" size 4 overnighter. Perfect. Anti vaxx propaganda, sounding remarkably like Russian troll bot. ""Gene therapy"" absolutely what's happening. Matt Gaetz: Same! Yet, there's always chance one could develop. I'm arguing opening saying chance one could mutate rest world unvaccinated population although that's unlikely rate US going. I've seen pretty hokey clickbait thrown around anti-vax crowd comes there.

It might op-eds something though. :shrug: Well whole point first paragraph say many places seem still enforced, despite legal requirement so. Admittedly based random redditors said articles read event cancellations restrictions lifted.

But clearly also case restrictions universally enforced even legally place, evidenced places I've visited restrictions enforced.

So no, OP necessarily right. data seems rather meaningless unless know restrictions still enforced. said didn’t even get positive Covid test know add it? get antibody test? Arkansas announced didn't. specifically stated evidence link vaccine events, could find causal relationship, increased rate events people vaccine.

This entire situation ridiculously easy resolve. that's needed someone show comparison incidences condition unvaccinated population vs vaccinated population, showing higher incidence latter, slam dunk. happened, increase. probably wasn’t clear- knew . “wow-ing” trying claim European company incorrectly. Oh yh vaccine production clearly much complex thing us think
 simple countries Canada EU countries facing supply issues especially many vaccines order likely vaccines available coming months. last administration vaccine distribution plan except ""let states figure out."" exact non-plan implemented testing PPE. balked securing enough doses entire population also balked invoking Defense Production Act ramp vaccine production. tell people they're good go one shot mRNA vaccines, run risk getting second shot, they're good one, get second? idea would happen trials done situation.

Which leads another problem. CDC FDA **never** going suggest using vaccines way approved trials. agree you, look US last year.. I’d hesitate “tell truth” average joe interpret centimetre leeway mean “I free whatever want.” think weird variable plenty assholes want protect people. 

It's people complaining showing communication history security services claiming nothing hide instead safe thing protect rest us. breed conspiracy theorist. NJ claiming vaccines work what? Can't see logic even making claim like that. “I choose asshole put peoples’ lives risk!” Exactly like Faucci told us need masks preserve healthcare workers. told us truth make masks. liar trusted... Ha! People trying 'educate' idiots years, without much obvious success. :/ really not, even enough resources check every potential case due lack man power resources secondly large number cases going undetected due lack phone tracing enforcement. created app one uses it, since never made mandatory. half done measure best that's accomplished anything helped track hot spots. Sorry. thinking current predominant strains. please - stop comparing flu. way. They’re track March. probably it’s going track this. way 99% sure it. fact good chance it. absolutely still get vaccine. Yes is. corporate trees work. American company since bought J&amp;J 1963. company founded 1953. quite literally American company vast majority existence. actually come before, Nature.com foremost biological journal world. typically spectacular source, though press headlines could better. Makes kind feel less guilty fuck ups I've work. Atleast fucked life saving vaccine lool thought case way knowing sure got data now. think mask mandates longer thing 50 US states Vaccine passports like NY's Excelsior Pass participate society normal. I'm vaccinated. show papers live like human being. least two nothing new going there. they’ll never tell truth lie serves well NOOOOO SUPPOSED DIE!!! going look good CV. 

Interview: ""could explain left job J&amp;J""

Guys: ""yh may may fucked life saving vaccine"" I’m pessimist. make feel better tbh. Two things here:

1- side effects observed high rates UK, despite much higher number AZ doses.

2- take 1:50000 risk get that's absolutely worth it. I'm 29, maybe 20,000 days live. Even 1:50000 risk *death* (which beyond even outrageous claims) would less life lost half day I'm almost guaranteed lose feeling like shit following vaccine. already was, refused extend unemployment benefits made suffer Looks like timeline am. Got evening, woke feeling great, ended leaving work early lying bed low grade fever, body aches, nightmares (I never remember dreams) next morning. 

Tylenol ok'd injection. feel fine soon. think fat fingered 50. 417 per day state would 5 per 100,000 per day. think 5 per 100,000 per day line that's popular among epidemiologists. think would view 50 per 100,000 per day approaching crisis. western Pa, Ohio tons openings right across border. used Rite Aid arrived hour early still took us.   ~~2~~ 0.2 ~~weeks~~ miles ~~flatten curve~~ finish run! Life always risk. United Failed State America  possible, there's reason think can't administer boosters fight it. much faster first vaccine, likely similarly effective. might still lose couple battles, war heavily favor now. hope right right virus looks like going pretty rapidly NYC. hope things turn around soon!  That's responding to. dealing head idea unvaccinated people lepers. cro-magnon level linking. OK, 25% total take vaccine. Sure. *not* statement made article. error communication give incorrect statements. going create vaccine hesitancy treat people morons can't search news different sources. 

Conspiracy nuts see conspiracies everywhere type miscommunication BBQ fodder fort hem. 

Bad journalism. Serious question. fully vaccinated couple months. ok wear mask? still mandate mean still wear even though CDC says don’t spread virus? don’t mask someone confronts keep vax card times? serious questions have. I'd throw long enough people high risk point hospitals won’t overwhelmed really doesn’t matter, curve flattened. Right?

First, I'm sure raised ""people put tennis balls pointy tables"" sounds like *they* ones fucked up.

Secondly, Gen Xer, Gen Z sister Millenial cousin . . . *hundreds* houses never, ever seen tennis balls sharp corners.

Where fuck guy living? Haha NY can’t handle shit cmon Wow, that's barely cases. That's great! mink-sourced mutation?

Just minks (or animals) may vectors doesn’t mean let vector too? Hey, Semblance Normalcy band name! mean, *now* is. miss opportunity test. exposure less five days ago, wait five days. makes much sense. I’m young already got first Moderna shot. hear bad sides effects 2nd shot. hell it! bother. Maybe Israel share? understand. personally think could done better job explaining position making recommendations time. 

A simple “we don’t quite know yet let’s continue precautions gather data...” would better response point vaccines? Wife’s currently 18 hour ER shift she’s one signed daughter (and assured worth risk), I’ll get try get link gets home Yes, let breed new variants. Great plan. think Europe liberated Soviet army? CDC lied us masks would tell truth here? public wants hear. Although didn’t read article. worth time Baltimore Uhhhh thought well known. learned stuff college studying molecular biology like 16-17 years ago. know news now...?

Heck remember even using debate material Creationists thought mutation natural selection generate new information improved function around 2005 Kitzmiller V Dover trial. really don’t get rush masks people. It’s trivial thing do. barely remember even mine on. point, seem pretty much same. vaccines recommend? easily able get vaccination appointment nearby Walmart pharmacy going Walmart's website night became eligible exactly 12am. Apparently that's time Walmart opens new vaccine appointment slots able snag one tomorrow noon! 12am Monday morning adults Louisiana became eligible. happening Brazil... could nobody testing whatever. got mine today AZ. astounded smooth easy drive vaccination. Whoever logistics planning put master class. Rioiight.... healthy ones covid doesnt pose risk to? much

It much. month. Except 48 percent US plan getting vaccinated Significant lack information. 'The flu killed people volcanic eruprions let's jump volcano!'. Stupid can't fixed. something FUD refusal, I'd say pandemic rather reasonable categorize proponents difficulties making good decisions. reason beyond political fights scared needles may get ouchie? talking anti-vax.

Ahahaha  CVS found mine. sites PITA “hunting” available appts, pretty painless. Waaaaay oversimplified false title. Nothingburger. scaremongering, vaccine works every variant weve tested three Glad type problem. wouldn’t.. MVP. Thanks. Redditors thought otherwise lol. NY 30+ right opens 16+ 6th. way makes sense immunocompromised family member she’s worried about. 

I suspect people bit Stockholm Syndrome last year lives anxiety resuming life. Gotcha. Wisconsin fucking around. Why, idea, considering terribly handled literally everything else pandemic. Lol next rant participation trophies said EU. Getting vaccine also insures that, get covid vaccinated, illness won’t lead hospitalization death. (the chance non-zero, close) handled though? Italy? Barely. Florida never even official mask mandate we're fine. guys definitely need worried now. think around mid/late February Pfizer board member said it’d mid April we’ll begging people get this. J&amp;J better others? I’m imagining people walking around vaccine doses pockets jabbing antivaxxer’s arms subway. Whining logical behavior lol. still trending up? mention Germany? got J&amp;J wish got Pfizer Moderna. confused feel like news implies vaccines that? could immune still pass on, understand husband phobia needles (passes gets shots every time), probably easy convince.

I hate needles too, never going get vaccine. 

My dog go vet annual checkup vaccinations day first dose scheduled. figured get 4 shots butt cheek without whining, could get one shot arm.

I look away getting injected, barely feel thing. preliminary read-out today Pfizer 12+. good news. Kids able start getting vaccinated supply increased Q3. E gravã treaba acolo? Look red zip code state try get appointment you’re struggling! one things messaging messed start pandemic. less likely kids get become seriously ill it, dragged on, that's mostly held true, kids still becomes seriously ill die it, lifelong effects.

That said we're testing vaccine younger younger age groups appearing work even better them. suspect we'll see eventually become usable them. signed morning, first day eligibility. Yeah. dangerous claim make. ""Bang partner vaccine teenager! There's possible way get covid spread immune compromised grandparent!""

I realize that's they're saying, people (especially teens) going hear 100% like ""cool, I'll completely immune,"" even though that's quite works.

Dangerous. reading article March 2020? It’s illegal anti vax far know ty, unfortunately dont open pdf devices use personal:( comments... I'm worried future holy smokes.  r/brandnewsentence would assume official documentation literally cannot vaccinated sufficient travel purposes, well purpose proof vaccine would needed. 

If people don’t want vaccinated, making choice understanding certain things limited. 

If people object TSA requirements flying, know travel another means subjected requirements. 

It’s weird people demand choices, mad choices available don’t suit them. teens healthy unfortunately Feel polluted La air Eurgh, I'm Infliximab Canada could 4 months second dose. Let's see happens. doesn’t prevent transmission, hell here?

The vaccine tested effectiveness preventing serious illness death.  
It tested effectiveness stopping spread virus. 

Furthermore, vaccine 100% effective. 

Your friend wise cautious. Bro, Baltimore higher murder rate Chicago lmaooo.

• Baltimore: ~51 per 100k 

• Chicago: ~21 per consistently Top 5 comes murder rates US. It’s usually #2, actually, behind St. Louis. NJ resident here. worry much it. doses got upped half million week, include believe community vax centers. Regardless whatever is, actual total we're getting per week 500,000 vaccines.

In couple weeks we're going hit 50% adults 18 first shot. I'd say 5-7 weeks left crap cases start drop due vaccinations. It'll still bit hectic [we're currently track hit 70% vaccinated two doses July 4th time website linked live change, amount time take slowly decreasing time went on. Last week towards middle July. Shame we!  “made” anything. evolved traits. Yes semantics matter. *Shrug* fact remains vaccinations open, understand frustrated supply isn’t meeting demand. doesn’t change fact *could* get vaccine much way *could* get PlayStation 5. 

Does mean local government Feds bang job? No. question isn’t open everyone MN government mandate, open, regardless healthcare provider restrictions. It’s 2 months, calm tf down. Give years really starts sound like EMA trying twist bend way 'admitting' likely link symptoms vaccine here. 

It also horrible ethical dilemma here. state likely link AZ vaccine still quite unlikely side effects EU probably adjust already slow vaccination program. Still ultimately, experts supposed make decisions based science, politics. Sure thing. Rock flag eagle! legitimately think amount people would want vaccinated guaranteed return normal life would dramatically outweigh amount people would lie getting vaccinated. ever going get everyone country vaccinated ridiculous imagine happening. need start thinking best ways encourage vaccinations, acting like vaccines can't change anything anyone people want going help feeling. ain’t true. Germany definitely found link vaccine. statistics clear. One would expect &lt;1 case randomly exact disease timeframe 2.7 vaccines handed out. Yet 31. statistically extremely obvious. single cases another vaccine history. got appointment checking 2am. 15 open pharmacy. I’ve gotten flu flu shot I’m masking flu season. Really enjoyed getting sick year. getting downvoted know answer question either A. valid comorbidity B. recieving illegitimately. gotcha question annoying. Yes that’s good distinction. said 5% time meant 5% people exposed sufficiently contract Covid first place, already fraction total people. might still somehow point stands portion population going contract pass Covid, even it’s relatively rare Ya thought accurate. know Moderna ton stuff development right now, ranging single dose vaccine one that’s designed storage regular freezer temperatures, long third dose vaccine, variant specific vaccine, combination vaccine, probably stuff Im even remembering.

And know it’s FDA either, Health Canada isn’t requiring phase 3 either said asian racism narrative fake media full shit. Fully vaccinated one dose? like 16% fully vaccinated. actually believe masks helpful preventing transmission people ""don't mask up"" likely get infected infected already, grants similar immunity actual vaccine. need everybody get vaccinated I've never seen anyone even rudimentary understanding epidemiology suggest anything even close impossible outcome. Good shit, worried vaccinated people could still carriers. biggest question also false positive. False positives comes flights important. haven’t even ventured Daily Discussion thread. I’ll give mods time clean place bit do. talking variants affecting vaccine efficacy long run... 

...One day time. cold believe people get vaccine... lower bound test is? awesome news ! enough info toddlers catching spreading vaccine efficacy. 

So 100% safe send toddler preschool/daycare parents vaccinated? daycare workers states vaccinated teachers daycare workers. let tiny human yet, risking people around far catch spread? He's young wear mask day, need social development. Luckily friend already dose studies show even single dose helps alot Another poster pointed rerun. Bolsanaro responsible this, make mistake  anti-vaxxers ignore like information that’s come far. “But there’s evidence vaccines stop infections! I’ve read lot COVID!” Canada’s great vaccinations 2 ~~weeks~~ months  efficacy rate 95% actually means vaccinated people 95% lower risk getting COVID-19 unvaccinated people, 5% vaccinated people get it. Pfizer trials, like 0.04% vaccinated people (or 4 10,000). 

[Efficacy/effectiveness Funny, local news program morning confirmed nearly 100 cases Idaho [“fully vaccinated” people testing positive 

Most mild symptoms, 3 w/serious conditions wound hospitalized. It’s small percentage total (0.5%), it’s zero. 

A relative mine also “fully vaccinated” paper - shots Pfizer completed month ago. Guess what? Immune system apparently doesn’t work anymore &amp; created zero antibodies. They’re still fully risk catching (&amp; transmitting) Covid, despite getting vaccine. 

Take “Data Suggests” grain salt. many vaccinations, I’d say “super spreaders” probably already gotten it, people still wear masks... 

Can’t wait things go back normal. miss seeing people’s faces. wouldn’t like vax virus? Answer: it’s not. can’t tell it’s don’t proof yet. rough part many dummies don’t get vax still spread child population it’s going take years years go away completely. Yeah concerned wish vaccination program country expedite.. also norovirus, likely people actually washing hands using rise tho :(

basic human hygiene pandemics. never cool share fecal matter wash bathroom. Factor Natural Immunity please stop cherry picking Green pass wont exist forever dude gained (or anyone) feeling ill, wear mask everyone else's sake; believe practice case cultures. need constantly wear mask normal circumstances. r/suddenlygay aren’t lied to. shitty headline shitty website. CDC said can’t transmit got vaccine. said, obviously gotten vaccine still potentially get COVID thus pass someone else. point data suggesting one vaccinated also didn’t get infected still transmitting virus. Sounds confusing, know. point still concern even don’t get infected, vaccinated people could still spread COVID. evidence suggests vaccinated don’t get infected, aren’t going able transmit covid either. make little sense? Either way, CDC hasn’t made anything definitive certainly aren’t “lying” you. Canada still less new cases daily US per capita well like one third deaths per capita whole pandemic. fucked ""majority"". also starting finally see vaccine flowing looking finish couple months behind US. Great news. know vaccine study looking particular? 4500 attributed vaccine 4500 occurred post vaccine survalence? Variant virus end cycle quit fear mongering I’ll fully vaccinated next week. might stop wearing mask regularly months, ever. prefer masking public. I’m immune compromised gives extra layer protection. It’s kinda nice social freedom protect myself. yeah mask trophy still keep That’s 2 weeks ago Cry lockdown 3.0 Toronto scientific evidence 3ft? thought coughing 13ft, even 6ft bogus arguing actual person, made-up person head. Dude..... going assume actually think moment. 
France going back lock-down two days.

In mid west US daily cases climbing again. well percentage positive tests going up. 

Brazil's medical system still taters last surge. 

Their country's finish public vaccination programs two years. 

It anything over. Scott Gottleib Walensky Fauci Chicken pox? Ugh! God gave us vaccines, don’t see it!? cry new quarantine tomorrow Quebec City Another poster shared  Good. need market news, use imperial system. Yeah, that’s inaccurate. New variants absolutely coming up, time let guard down. missing something? want 3080 gpu current CDC recommendation yes, fully-vaccinated people dine indoors, without masks/precautions, gathering ONE household unvaccinated people, long unvaccinated household contain high-risk people (such recent organ transplant) expect reasonable level safety. seems exactly type scenario they’re saying, “yes, go ahead — full vaccination protective enough activity safe.” I’m assuming going let lose cinco de mayo :) Take china. within 200 nautical miles territory. Solid Advice. cast doubt variant evading vaccine. That’s definitely possible, would likely take year more. Would like president? do. eyes front production process, eyes back end quality checks. We're lucky eyes back end least caught distribute administer doses. would even catastrophic, safety measures place succeeded stopping it.

Sometimes multiple failure points line way leads disastrous consequences (it's swiss cheese model accident causation). impossible perfect even multiple layers safeguards. Connecting fear mongering insecurity journalist's personal life kinda weird probably far-fetched. Interesting take.  never reached herd immunity.

Just media shitholes brainwashed ppl thinking herd immunity achieved country 25% immunity. often people Corona get lung damage? Well EU's behaviour ensured scared enough manufacturers GSK decided manufacture 60million Novavax doses UK instead Belgium.

That means 4 vaccines manufactured start sending tens millions deserving countries commonwealth, Africa Asia South America Yeah absolutely. effective 100% effective. Vulnerable people need aware that. folks following mask guidelines pakistan? india, middle class educated folks responsible second wave. attending wedding arranging social gatherings ans refraining taking vaccines. introvert enjoys anonymity child heart feels like bandit mask on, keep wearing masks every day? I’ve got nice collection going I’m ready ditch em yet! Even day job 400-degree grill lol Numbers Pennsylvania going up. Wave/surge number four! think important takeaway article 1 million people vaccinated. Like said, arent 100% effective. that's .01% hospitalization rate. terrible people got sick. even worse 2 elderly people passed away. still SIGNIFICANTLY better pre-vaccine. THATS right? 
my wife vaccinated we're...good go? 

like fucking movie restaurant? 

i know longest time theyve saying ""we dont data yet say whether spread post-vax""

but sounds like data (it what, month ago two studies came isreal regarding subject. hadnt peer reviewed?) 

can finally start learning worried fucking time now? 90% efficacy actually means vaccinated person 90% lower risk getting COVID-19 unvaccinated person, 1 10 could get it. Pfizer trials, infection rate vaccinated people 0.04%, like 4 10,000. Much prettier numbers

[CDC explanation efficacy/effectiveness explanation efficacy/effectiveness  Ohhh everywhere. People smart apply bed may day two think might need bed. wait last moment. Great! matter get vaccine. mean way. vaccinated people countries. recovered. little death ratio. plenty positive stats. sure statistician skill derive those. Pro tip : outsource math india, less labor charges &amp; unfiltered stats.  think disseminating scientific information laypeople problematic...because...they know before? That's, uh,...certainly example words sentence. Also, pretty much Texas forced quarantine full week February due Snowpocalypse. Lots us theorize reason case decline. noted BioNTech much bigger Moderna. clarify, please? raw dogs! 
roof roof! write stories Sun 😅 Yeah lot harder people like OP link pre-print studies low prevalence areas fly face everything every study found.

Science something ignore underpowered study pops result want see. preponderance evidence shows children 10 years younger, study Tönshoff et less likely acquire SARS-CoV-2 less likely transmit countries biopharmaceutical infrastructure

Germany's pharma much bigger UK's. don’t think ever relax mask mandates social distancing. risks great happening again. need controls place happen again. Aapne ghabrana nahi hai... Awesome, got first shot. 

Now get vaccine allergies?! nose eyes fire!! put people jail simple mistakes, get really good covering mistakes. really want that. Lots people testing it. thanks covid, people likely attentive cold flu symptoms. major issue getting populace US vaccinated ensuring worldwide distribution vaccine getting rest poorer countries completely vaccinated. Currently, pharma companies holding vaccines produced companies. ensures receive higher profit expense poorer nations.

The biggest problem that? Variants, possibly vaccine resistant/immune, inevitably come due waiting vaccinating rest world. name profit. evolutionary standpoint, it’s better virus less lethal.

May introduce covid-19, disease contagious phase days 3 14 deadly phase days 10 50?

That old adage (about diseases mutating less lethality) made diseases (the worst) sickness contagiousness much closer together, time.

I can't tell whether covid vaccines sterilizing not, seem pretty good preventing spread!

'Just solved one obstacle, another pops up.' look behind scenes Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, two key Belgian figures.

'The biggest challenge? Scaling production lightning speed. pandemic, mRNA vaccine ever made industrial scale.'

In exclusive briefing US pharmaceutical company Pfizer seven domestic foreign journalists, Luc Van Steenwinkel, managing director production packaging site Puurs, gives details production Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The essentials
Pfizer produces 100 million corona vaccines per month Puurs-Sint-Amands.
One dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 280 components, 86 suppliers 19 countries.
European export controls mean additional administrative burden.
'We got first call March 2020 shipped first vaccines December 23, record pace. that, scale lines filling vaccine vials set 'freezer farm' summer store vaccines -80 degrees Celsius. time, suppliers increase capacity too.'

In order get raw materials Puurs, widely branched chain set up, components supplied Pfizer sites - group 40 worldwide - external companies.

You see bottlenecks supply glass production vaccine vials, also raw materials.

LUC VAN STEENWINKEL
MANAGING DIRECTOR PFIZER PURES
'That chain particularly complex,' says Belgian Danny Hendrikse, vice president global supply Pfizer. 'The components come Europe, world.' One dose requires 280, come 86 suppliers 19 countries.

For example, lipids, crucial raw material mRNA vaccine, made chemical company Croda International Yorkshire, England, among places. minuscule 'fat globules' wrap RNA, unstable genetic material piece coronavirus forms basis vaccine.

In Puurs, mRNA material, supplied US Pfizer sites Chesterfield Andover BioNTech facilities, wrapped lipids. final vaccines filled glass vials, automatically manually checked defects, cracks. go door, vials kept packed special freezers. total, 40 quality controls carried out.  

In practice, bottle necks pop regularly, according Van Steenwinkel. entire pharmaceutical industry pressure. billions doses corona vaccines needed worldwide. see bottlenecks supply glass production vaccine vials, also raw materials.

'European export controls additional administrative burden, get approval every shipment.

DANNY HENDRIKSE
VICE PRESIDENT GLOBAL SUPPLY PFIZER

'Just solved one obstacle, another pops up. far manage everything. there's problem supplier, deal it, alternatives network.'

Production cycle accelerated considerably
Pfizer managed shorten production cycle - mRNA production shipping - 110 days, already fast, 60.

At time, Hendrikse points European export controls vaccines make things easier. 'It additional administrative burden, get export approval every shipment. deliveries compromised.'

So far, 232 million vaccine doses left 84 countries worldwide. produce 100 million vaccines per month Puurs,' says Van Steenwinkel. 'As May, even more.'

Also, vaccine takes like, 5 weeks immunity. I'm knocking effectiveness, pointing properly, would need wait 5 weeks *after* people got vaccinated open, open 5 weeks *before* get it. ""2 weeks flatten curve""
You remember that. Nice! happened rapid test Yale NBA working on? find strange take. vast majority vaccines requiring two shots given months apart. epidemiology, allows body time build antibodies get booster shot.

First off, we're middle third wave right now, vaccine we're getting takes almost 6 weeks first dose give antibodies. continue are, people going get sick immune system responds fully vaccine. 

My experience vaccines michigan last month little unfortunate. background, work hospital full time, qualifying healthcare, I'm 28 comorbidities. availability opened up, figured would wait bit let older people people comorbidities sign first, bad idea.

I started signing late February via county, work, every wait list could find. Every morning, would check rite aid, seemed big chain would post availability ever morning. rite aid stores around vaccine, none available appointment times. seemed like overbooked boosters, didnt enough staff qualified give vaccine. ones right across border ohio day appointments, popping list gave michigan resident. month that, decided go rite aid ohio :-/.

We supposed open vaccinations anyone 16+ month, think maybe even today starts, I'm entirely optimistic. sad thing is, *we're paying right now.* middle third wave, nobody cares vaccine, takes 6 weeks antibodies, impossible get. issue hotel quarantine.

I force commute home... Right commute walking lap around neighborhood Yep, year first year adult voter going vote anything CDU. us never stopped. It’s ok, LNP got put logo posters said “contain.” You’re also exaggerating level lockdown, duration lockdown  compliance basic measures.

We saw article article families losing loved ones family gatherings masking distancing rules ignored. That’s one example many ways people avoided complying fundamental non pharmaceutical interventions US past year.

I agree people unlikely comply better throughout year. doesn’t mean measures properly followed won’t help limit spread virus. 

This virus spread human behavior. doesn’t magically appear. Theres green parties tonnes countries, imagine one states There’s risk. even slightest risk, FDA would halted J&amp;J vaccinations immediately. current J&amp;J doses totally different facility unaffected Baltimore plant issue. sounds like massive invasion privacy. well aware government paid them. three different health insurance companies throughout life none made pay flu shot, FYI. Well obvious need us AZ keep population rejecting vaccine like seen France example. also doctor expert, read AZ research papers. 

the scientific evidence spreading virus it, stems lack certain acid detected among vaccinated covid positives. can’t remember acid name, remember specifying lack acid stops spreading it. 

i read that, basic plain explanation fuck story / data reported Ohio yesterday supports claim.

“According Ohio Department Health, 34 1.8 million Ohioans vaccinated since December tested positive COVID-19, resulting five hospitalizations zero deaths” Hungary suffering devastating surge COVID-19 deaths, despite fact highest vaccination rate European Union.

Guessing Malta small counted?

Per 100k:

Hungary: 28,119
Malta: 41,320 Florida's excess deaths vs reported covid deaths always lower national.

Eg, March September 2020 timeframe used linked analysis, Florida's excess deaths approximately 68% higher reported covid deaths, versus approximately 43% nationally. Glad hear Spahn says thing said 1 2 months ago.

EU, get us booster shots, – order ourselves. Like yesterday.  people keep repeating stuff J&amp;J tested surge that's efficacy lower, true. Real world data come mRNA vaccines head J&amp;J. variants hurt efficacy Pfizer shown Isreal almost cases UK variant. J&amp;J got favorable conditions US trials still got 72% protection symptomatic infection ONE! shot mRNA vaccines 80% effective infections including asymptomatic exclude asymptomatic infections provide 90% protection. I'm guessing nearly zero Covid cases big deal (relatively speaking course)? said 3 people fully vaccinated still got virus. assuming contracted virus immunity kicked in? regular PPE orders care stolen hospitals. restrict used gloves toileting applying creams orders short. meant use gloves cleaning, food preparation, showering someone etc etc.

We also month plastic aprons all. use bin liners.

However bad hospitals think it, worse care homes. made much worse fact discharged people care without negative test. working dementia unit time. cannot keep dementia patients locked one room. possible. everyone talked vaccinated process, fully vaccinated, willing accept 10% risk possibly getting virus. primary reasoning data indicates risk serious illness post vaccine low risk death reported statistically zero percent. 

Yes might get infected post-vaccine likelihood going survive. comorbidities go back primary determinant survival virus itself. sorta like obvious bullshit Surgeon General last year ""masks dont work"" - guess ""good lie"" something... information like that, want get vaccine?? new double mutated strain discover? Ah yes Goldilocks principle viral spread. Flu IR low spread masks, Covid juuuust right. Huh, well, governor's wording mean means then. ""Per day"" means, ya know, ""once day"" :). least 6 months. first cohort dosed (the clinical study) received vaccine 6 months ago. know protection lasts however long it. revisit period time see protection holds true. likely will. go on, remember

Pfizer started testing vaccine children aged six months 11 years last week. developers, including Oxford team, also planning trials involving children.

Ugur Sahin, chief executive BioNTech, said: “Across globe, longing normal life. especially true children. initial results seen adolescent studies suggest children particularly well protected vaccination.” said encouraging given spread B.1.1.7 UK variant. Sahin added: “It important enable get back everyday school life meet friends family protecting loved ones.” Washington state 101 fully vaccinated people developed COVID-19. mRNA vaccinations 90% efficacy. Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J AstraZeneca said it’s possible get infected symptomatic. also said it’s possible still carry spread asymptotic fully vaccinated. CDC, whatever reason, blowing smoke. need EU health system. Many countries healthcare systems rated best world. 

The EU stay focusing free trade goods movement people. [3]

Half participants trial given vaccination half placebo shot. Covid-19 cases detected group received vaccine 18 infections among not.

The vaccine produced “robust immune responses” reports serious side-effects, Pfizer said. present, vaccine approved UK people aged 16 years over. yet clear whether Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation, independent panel experts advises government immunisation strategy, back vaccination children, rarely fall seriously ill Covid-19.
Experts said needs known whether vaccines prevent people transmitting virus.
Professor Saul Faust, director NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, involved Pfizer trial, said results looked “generally encouraging”.

However, added data would needed whether vaccine prevented asymptomatic carriage therefore transmission virus.
These factors would important weigh considering whether teenagers children vaccinated, said, main rationale would probably prevent disease spreading vulnerable adults.
Data Office National Statistics shows Covid-19 mentioned death certificates nine children last year. one every 5,000 children catch coronavirus develop rare inflammatory syndrome go hospital. [2]

“We global manufacturing company sophisticated global supply chain . . . Every one suppliers important supply chain every one plays role,” spokeswoman Pfizer said.
Yesterday EU’s medical regulator said evidence support decision several member states, including Germany France, stop using AstraZeneca vaccine younger adults concerns rare blood disease.

European leaders backed threats block vaccine exports UK last week also demanded AstraZeneca increase supplies Europe. Thierry Breton, internal market commissioner, said yesterday “zero” jabs would shipped across Channel AstraZeneca failed meet commitments bloc.
Daily second doses vaccine Britain outnumbered first doses first time. total 270,526 second doses registered March 30, compared 224,590 first doses.

New trial data suggests Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine safe offers strong levels protection Covid-19 children young 12, potentially setting stage adolescents immunised later year.
In trial involved 2,250 children United States aged 12 15 jab entirely effective preventing symptoms Covid-19.
Albert Bourla, Pfizer chairman chief executive, said vaccine approved use children matter “urgency”.
He added: “We plan submit data [the US medical regulator] proposed amendment emergency use authorisation coming weeks regulators around world, hope starting vaccinate age group start next school year.” like tho. would fuck people get vaccine well. like vaccines, work everyone gets it. people count everyone else keep safe. [1]

EU export controls become burden Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine production, drugmaker said.
The free movement goods across borders “absolutely critical” operation plant Belgium, supplies Britain 70 countries jabs, US company said.
Danny Hendrikse, vice-president global supply, said regulations introduced February put new pressures supply chain. company required notify Belgian government advance every parcel vaccines plans export. Approval must granted European Commission.

“It caused significant administrative burden uncertainty,” said. “Ultimately would like colleagues focus making distributing vaccine.”
Pfizer explained yesterday vaccine, developed partnership Germany’s Biontech, requires 280 components sourced 86 suppliers 19 countries, including Britain.

Increasing number suppliers key dramatically increasing production levels plant Puurs Belgium, batch sizes vaccine doubled. time takes make vaccine cut nearly half, 110 days 60.

'USA' Bloomberg piece ( user wrong mistook title opening paragraph) co-written German author. one authored bloomberg article last month entitled 

""Merkel's Hand Prints Germany's Vaccine Failings""

Here quotes Angela Merkel starting crack pressure Germany's faltering coronavirus vaccine program. chancellor fire publicly lack Covid-19 shots strategy delegating responsibility European Union looking misguided, snapped pressed answers German state Getting angrier involved ever seen, threatened retaliate make officials’ mistakes public, shocking participants silence. occasions, she’s come close tears public recent asked recently whether would willing apologize missteps, deflected instead responded lecture complex production process, including role saline solution.

Please look paragraphs slowly think simply would expect see type writing Reuters? would fly Reuters kind clickbait journalism.. reuters accurately reflected ultimate conclusion EMA press event headline went detail article instead resorting tabloid content generate views. sure problematic good source it: Andrew Pollard, head Oxford Vaccine Group chief investigator trial vaccine, said extending gap vaccines made biological sense. “Generally, longer gap vaccine doses leads better immune response, second dose causing better boost. (With HPV vaccine girls, example, gap year gives better responses one month gap.) Oxford vaccine trials, 70% protection first dose second dose, immune response three times greater second dose second dose delayed, comparing second dose four weeks versus second dose 2-3 months,” told BMJ, referring MHRA’s summary product characteristics.11

“With Pfizer vaccine, published data comparing shorter longer gaps doses participants second dose 3-4 weeks. However, biology straightforward vaccines . . . immune system remembers first dose respond whether later dose three weeks three months.”

In statement British Society Immunology said, “Most immunologists would agree delaying second ‘booster’ dose protein antigen vaccine (such two approved covid-19 vaccines) eight weeks would unlikely negative effect overall immune response post-boost. also would expect specific safety issues arise individual due delaying second dose, increased potential risk disease extended period due lowered protection.”

It also says:

A spokesperson Department Health Social Care England said, “As agreed four UK chief medical officers medical experts independent Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation, data provided manufacturers demonstrated vaccines offer considerable protection patients first dose.

“This measure greatest impact reducing mortality, severe disease, hospitalisations, helping protect NHS save lives.”

Honestly, think well-calculated decision maximise protection currently data shows right. strategy saved thousands tens thousands lives, considering bad pandemic January/February. guess that's luck right? Thanks response, I'm sure company test coworkers test comes back positive today. vaccine still orders magnitude less dangerous covid... catch COVID  Except unvaccinated people spreading increasing chances kids getting (because can't vaccinated yet).

Not mention places World far behind vaccinations. suspect ideas true.  body makes variants memory B cells, anticipation variants original virus.  AND, chance virus mutate way anticipated.  (And hence, still important prevent transmission, less opportunity new variants develop.) 

I think either-or binary choice. dealing shades grey.  new variant emerges, probability person immunity original virus, also (some level of) immunity new variant.  100%, also 0%. statistic way FYI. US it’s like 30-60k. agreed masks. avoid going public you’re sick, you’re able. Here, vaccination optional nursing home employees. There's lot vaccine refusal hesitancy smaller towns rural areas, including among medical professionals healthcare facility personnel. unvaccinated workers thought cause Covid outbreak among group 17 least partially vaccinated residents nursing home. residents fine. Nobody died, one went hospital observation never required treatment symptoms. least low demand vaccines means every high risk person wanted vaccine able get it, adult wants it, regardless age risk level get too. testing people part initial trials last year? going expect need shot annually? likely follow-up procedures vaccine. care enough shut airports nobody care either.

I keep seeing cost-benefit argument consistently. ready substitutes, really matter? example, Germany 20 million 60+ population whereas AZ supply might merely cover 7 million people June. costs we're talking exactly Germany vaccinates 60+ population AZ, younger groups vaccines? still need millions 3 vaccines cover whole 60+ group. example, Europe, ""British Mutant"" dominant. Guess mass vaccinated like crazy: Great Britain far ahead everybody. Epidemiologists warned happening ages. wear masks everyone wants vaccine gets one. way 1. onus risk longer protect others, protect yourself. 2. everyone get vaccine can’t really create two tier system vax non vax citizens. scenario many unvaccinated individuals could claim vax. would nightmare.

Lol know put like that...good point dense. missing point general public actively looking reasons disregard virus get vaccinated stop wearing masks. science fact without masks mass vaccinations, things improve. No. means new data gives us better picture reality Fauci made statements.

That's science works. issues regarding Johnson Johnson, going significantly delay vaccination efforts U.S? There's reason epidemics come animals, mutate human infections.

The lethality covid-19 ideal evolutionary standpoint, animals like bats lethality much less, lethal humans weaker immune systems. remember listening lecture researchers years ago working genetically modifying basic foods produce essentially edible vaccines.

The temperature outside 42°C/108ºC. cools sunset, that's everyone (including me) goes out. Impossible go 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. gym basically empty, vaccine cannot sufficiently protect me, would go time. Hence question. Lovely, we'll get least effective vaccine worst side effects (which mean fewer people willing get it)and we'll get late. Hope 95-year-old mother make another year see dolts Tokyo dither suck teeth somehow still make worst possible decisions. ""if ain't cheating, ain't trying"" source that?

But can't write taaaaaaaaxes.... Mr. Bean :( AZ vaccine seems good efficacy 3 weeks first dose, probably fine.

I would still recommend going gym crowded, though. significant risk, contributes crowding makes harder others keep distance. don’t know are, love you. Keep awesome!

THANK YOU! variant multiple mutations developed individual. Period. happened. 

I feel like something possibly lost translation. still need know define multi-mutation. implication variants combined one two mutation happened possible based know. could wrong, feeling I'm not. 

There possibility something like divergent evolution occurred different species (variants instance) developed structurally similar adaptations survive similar environment i.e. different species animals developing wings fly, time different variants creating similar structural adaptations circumvent current treatments utilized health professionals inherent resistance present immune system population geographic area. link study? Well, mask wearing improves situation 1%, according CDC. negative effects society definitely dramatic. outside fresh air, masks make zero sense. need mRNA norovirus vaccine. bunch hand sanitizer started norovirus. I've ended hospital twice it, please give annual/biannual shot never risk again. listen. virus really care CDC says, better worse. Sure care people social media say.

Ice packed bars twice week couple weeks now. like basement dwellers reddit outside protesting. I've vaccinated awhile now, people weren't, that's them. Fauci said fine fully vaccinated people hang that's far go right guess. It'd interesting see would common vaccines held standards scrutiny we're c-19 vaccines. different opinions ok. call stupid. 

We much less 50 cases blood clots / millions vaccinated. Probably 20 deaths. Covid death rate higher even among younger group.

What called stupid analogy 737 situation. correct analogy is: country war, people die every day, survived 12 months evacuated 737 Max. 

It's standalone risk blood clot (still SMALL – actually quote science magazine article, broad universe risks, 20 millions low prone statistical errors), risk blood clot vs risk Covid. basically going sitting staring mountain excellent data months months won’t actually “true” scientific consensus isn’t safe. even though vaccinated people going hanging together without distancing it’s going perfectly fine, door still open people accuse putting lives risk. bickering going tops what's action plan making kids understand bigger picture?

Whether that’s happening variants came provable, evidence it, yet another reason need protect immunocompromised. needed reasons. say it’s unequivocally true current evidence silly. 

However, feel like aren’t familiar extensive genetic mapping tracking happening globally right now. That’s know. genetically sequencing samples routinely get ahead new variants. That’s multi-mutation variants shocking, scientists didn’t see coming poof despite precautions taken. also go back retroactively test samples try track variants identified.

I don’t know tell dude, data showing. Saying absolutely must true would silly well. enough evidence yet. Well, problem is, real world data. real world data messy. gain volume, lose hundred little small leaks confounding factors whatnot.

Add that, scientists tend extremely cautious well. going rough go until, think, vaccine companies get message rolling. going ""suggests"" ""probably"" type headlines.  think disseminating scientific information laypeople problematic...because...they know before? That's, uh,...certainly example words sentence.

Please read post again:

""Look, I'm trying negate joy learned something new cool. I've medical tech field 15 years experience **framing established institutional knowledge new discovery** problematic way communicating science public.""

I love teaching laypersons science. also needs done way makes clear well-established newer tentative. Part trustworthiness authority science wields institution truth time-tested idea is. Framing well-established science fact ""new discovery"" makes much sexier headlines, problem grossly undersells well-established science fact is. Thats sad story world need doses count.

EU insisted J&amp;J produced Belgium could go filling US plan - probably wise decision. 6 weeks post first Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine shot. somewhat protected? blood test find out?

I've started going (packed rafters) gym, wear Adidas mask time, I've bulked Vitamin levels (under guidance doctor, though know Vitamin helps protection not), I'm scared shitless cases going back peak levels country.

Should go time gym basically empty? get motivation work-out time, though; go motions come back. definitely agree this.  Sad Considering way people handled this, put anything past anymore. misunderstood. One person able harbor bigger pool variants otherwise would smaller non-immunocomprised person. variants multiple points variance. matter whether variations big enough considered actual new variant. one person not. difference perception really incredible. US still deaths per capita Germany, yet media Germany portrayed fumbling bumbling way stage pandemic, US seemingly ignoring restrictions giving fuck 1 thousand deaths day. backlash ticketmaster got ago teach Cuomo anything? know vaxxed people get long term organ damage. die initial infection risks involved. Right that’s I’m saying.

I’ve talked couple vaccine hesitant folks. say “well couldn’t get shot soon enough!” US media attacking AZ again...all done since day 1. really. happens lots vaccine manufactures exist within Europe - like European nations policy rolling vaccine continents. 

Europe's portfolio vaccines weaker many countries many vaccines bet failed trials delayed. European states ignored EMA advice vaccines European heads states media spouted anti-vax nonsense vaccines reduced public trust - thus leaving vaccines storage. That's Europe. yet 9% want take vaccine.

Whichc Biden 100 day pledge (tbh, initial goal incredibly low, something even Trump target achieve). Germany, EU large, opposite wonder people turning skeptical we, race, rather lose 100 old people covid 1 I’d rather lose 1 million old people one kids

then good thing making public health policy. kids, extension you, important. Hell yeah. One done. There’s thing enough companies shareholders. Yes, tend come around week cases start rise. value vary lot though depending several factors.

Here’s hoping OP right see decoupling.  Bingo! noticed too! It’s nice side effect need it. Europe beat virus, unlike European I'm relieved. part, isolated, wore masks, shot economy numbers finally we're going back normal. tourists bring virus right back would absolutely suck. [ECDC still shows 20 million delivered. could still backfilled tho. vaccine 100% effective, especially depending one get. Ok. Take shot 6 months ? personally start wearing mask public, crowded places, especially winter months. rather liked getting cold flu year see thinking though.  growing vaccines eggs. someone graduated 20 years ago wouldn’t learned school.  paper, newbies would look like relevant knowledge.

Yeah, like, lol. huge stockpiles - almost everything (aside AZ right now) going directly patients.

Where exactly vaccines from, WHO? Yup, listen Paul Offit this. He's reasonable rational optimistic vaccines hold line deaths serious outcomes. Sorry possible since passenger aircraft used transport cargo, quite literally seats, pandemic. think logistics mixed passenger/cargo cabin would make unfeasible (imagine person window seat use toilet). means long data right now.  hopeful last least year more. got mine Saturday morning, 6pm got real tired, stayed tired next 3 days, arm hurt like hell. relief?

Yeah, they're continuing monitor people clinical going expect need shot annually?

Possibly, sure yet. Could like annual flu shot. could also last longer that. Time tell.  Yeah maybe technically it’s essentially free 16+ conditions also smoking UK ahead doses per capita measurement I'm pretty sure, higher uptake % among age groups Lol seriously. may remember exact term 15 years later remember general concept.

This whole last year feels like media making long-standing biological principles shiny ""novel"" new terminology, makes layperson think ""novel"".

I really hate word ""novel"" now. fantastic results, especially combined CDC real-world data showing prevention symptomatic asymptomatic cases! 

The caveat Pfizer’s data South African variant amount events. 0 cases South African variant compared 6 placebo arm. said, arrow pointing right direction I’m hopeful this!

Maybe smokers seek medical help much country even eligible, unvaccinated dipshits? We'll see. genuinely hope outdoor masking unnecessary. Meanwhile though guess I'd rather kill somebody's grandma case. Got mine Monday, everything honor system here. imagine made people phase 1 show badges, even ask say qualified person. Insert Dave Chappelle fuck em that's meme Meanwhile South Africa still tryna figure distribute vaccines, think done, general population it’s probably years away completely right. get downvoted. Weirdly, smokers seem immune it. Everyone expecting represented turned opposite. They've looking unexpected theories. think one nitrus oxide, something like that.  4 kids, 3 see vaccine 2022. I'd love stock tests every stupid cough. even need September, either, definitely still good news.  Yeah know anti maskers give fuck people around them?

I also give fuck happens anti vaxxers. meant elsewhere. saying. don’t data six months hasn’t existed long... actually read thing. U.S., baby! U.S. everyone goes work matter what. overlords decreed it. Profits people. nightclubs open...

What’s next newborns? Fetuses? Ants? goal post moving serious.

You jest, considering (and likely always be) zoonotic reservoir, impossible imagine world eventually get kids vaccinated rando academic gets painted media saying develop animal vaccine, we'd better keep pandemic restrictions ""better safe sorry"". wonder we’ll eventually figure masks aren’t needed outside. remember reading something recently saying six foot rule didn’t apply outside? Guess time tell. Country wide herd immunity option. regional herd immunity too. get delivery distribution level flu vaccine I'd fine yearly booster. already get flu shot, give 1 appointment. Cool, seems pretty normal like flu /s implication vaccine companies ability develop even better vaccine BioNtech/Pfizer new virus less year deliberately choose ""MoNEy"" embarrassingly stupid. That’s entire point vaccine I’m done listening lot officials. They’re manipulating us. intention ever letting anything. First we’ll wait all
kids vaccinated, we’ll wait first endemic winter wave pass, numbers low Spring 2022 MORALLY OBLIGATED shoot zero COVID, year 3 masking distancing.

I get vaccinated, finished. People need end restrictions doctors never will. Germany amazing things smooth, bureaucracy means nobody wants change things. 
That complete opposite behavior need crisis. one thing absolutely need change cut red tape endless meetings+paperwork government think prevent hospitalization death protecting lungs COVID19 10 years. Protection sinuses last 2-3 years. Variants depend quickly reduce community spread. make $100 billion profit letting us get lives back alongside saving trillions economic activity, would best economic deal millennia. I’m thinking falling yet. I’m surprisingly calm. worrying. think people following guidelines getting burned out. don’t want another summer worry. really want vaccine approved children get vaccinated. Ya, think ethical thing starting shift. example, dipshit inlaws could vaccinated months ago. I'm fully vaccinated partner soon too. 

Once done, we'll probably go back visiting like normal per partner's wishes. catch us die, fuck em, that's point. fault chose reject science. conscience clear. confusing separate contracts contract EU AZ. There’s thing “enough” companies. Aye, it’s come back haunt Britain terribly love show! 😁 Feel like could really, really close next leg hospitalizations/deaths. adding natural immunity, likely approach 85-90% protection 65+ recent wave first doses begins taking effect. Lack access lack getting (due fear) preventative care cancer screenings covid denier talking point. point, study U.K. 1/3 due non covid reasons, I’ll try search study. Sigh...fair enough funny I'm I've vaccinated lose freedom movement country someone wants see papers. learn history. Yeah problem I’m observing long covid term nebulous. There’s marker like diabetes instance diagnostic. applies lot food service workers. Yes people prepping, cooking packaging food.

All risky take we’ve enjoyed last year. debate European council. Kurz says spend 2.8 billion instead 3.1 billion, Draghi says spend least 3.3 billion. 2 months intense negotiations agreement reached spend 3 billion, limited budgetary rule law concerns. forget mention, get laid sick 90 days, probably won't, employers Denmark dicks. 

Most places know off, actually keep contact sick employees try help anyway can. Masks somehow virtually got rid flu impact rhinovirus coronavirus. Also got rid flu even states people required wear masks everywhere. think top 80%, pretty good. cook gets taste cookie dough. annoying people reading ""at least six months"" taking mean last less year. C'mon, people, critical thinking skills. say ""at least six months"" right now, Pfizer trial going year yet. Bottom class? work dual license facility institute mental disease well skilled nursing facility instead hospital? family plaguedwith mental illness way helping others? sure mean? say ati-vax move on. business analysys certification actual black belt. fucking child you? Living mom dad still put school? Hopefully aisle vendors make return next season. Nothing like hearing ""Cold beer here!"" passing twenty line strangers exchange piss warm Coors. 


I miss going games, obviously We're given vaccination card get shot. flash anyone asks. majority vaccinated though, longer necessary. you, max person Brazil health system already collapsed, deaths happening effects that. appointment clinic April 8 supposed administering J&amp;J vaccine. worried could affect it? jus confirmed Tuesday would J&amp;J.

I know mix-up supposed affect doses already distributed appointment April 8th mean vaccine already supply chain? statement somehow incorrect? Herd immunity applies entire countries? government experts better job convincing people actually finish line then.

Maybe. also think true whole pandemic response it, beginning, one giant human experiment running real time we're trying figure go - including ""governments experts"".

We're talking brand new virus nobody ever seen new vaccines never used humans before. understand want instant, perfect information - instead learning go.

Why somebody like Fauci say ""it's over""? month two ago, nobody knew whether getting vaccinated meant get sick even transmissible virus. can't make statement like handful reports studies. types statements usually require *years* scientific study research.  news far good? Absolutely! making potentially life-or--death statements impact behavior hundreds millions people *should* require evidence handful studies.

As example abnormal w/r/t scientific process, vaccines even FDA approved yet. They're released pursuant Emergency Use Authorization. Full FDA approval vaccine take *decades*.

So yeah, understand Fauci want say ""it's over"" based handful early studies. speak soon something unexpected happens - boom - made huge mistake maybe cost thousands lives nobody trusts you. seek government job. They’re usually near top terms number people employed state. Nothing makes roll eyes quicker someone says “the government” general term whatever think government is. Government work includes museums, cultural centers, libraries, health departments, parks, etc. It’s politicians. It’s everyone maintenance workers agency heads benefits, benefits usually really good. Yep. Israel also ""shoulder"", slight rise another dip. likely artifact difference days restrictions loosening vulnerable vaccinated majority population vaccinated. Right? Going 10 years office job taken two days row once. taken 5 single days time. rest half-day increments can't away backup. (And get one. constantly thrown face degree lucky job. true truth hurts, still great way treat someone. need job know it.) comply happen European made doses sitting warehouse. may disappointed hear masks social distancing permanent measures even get vaccinated. I’d bet guess states you’re talking about... media absolute last thing trust tell us immunity fades. Lmao two shots lasts 6 months? I’m truly happy haven’t experienced it. creates extremely toxic, unhealthy (literally!) work environment. wouldn’t wish anyone. feel like..especially conservative areas...we need stop requiring appointments start walk ups. suspect large group people aren’t necessarily hesitant...just willing jump hoops required. Y’all start what’s going historic month vaccinations, especially almost every state opening everyone month. “encourage people take vaccine”? Yep, definitely proven comments part problem lol definition hell live Michigan, would advise sign vaccine asap. Six months? That'd mean constant cycle vaccinating. People saying meh ignoring rules since day one. could every 5 years, 10 years, never. know, there's evidence say likely outcome. Calling Saturday tend biggest days. No, obviously know that. novel disease even novel vaccine type. know far Pfizer appears effective Covid least one mutation least six months. 

It could ineffective mutations, could equally effective. could stop effective 7 months, could continue effective life. information one way other. Calling Memorial Day day ends. move free country Europe. Virginia CVS pharmacies certainly running vaccination units Sunday. taking look CVS website, looks like certainly vaccinating Sunday throughout entire country. Dang! Got scared 😳 it’s readily apparent it’s likely *undercount* based excess deaths. ~500,000 deaths normal 2020, ~150,000 official COVID count. 

And no, excess deaths somehow caused “severe lockdowns” somehow killing people—which new, dumb talking point covid deniers. 

If true would see significant excess deaths places severe lockdowns, severe COVID outbreaks, like Hawaii, vermont, etc. Spoiler: don’t. 

And no, deaths weren’t caused “deaths despair” like suicides, etc stay home orders—another disingenuous talking point.

[The conservative assumption pending investigations March May (when lockdowns happening) suicides yielded incident rate 0.89 (95% CI, 0.77-1.03) deaths per 100 000 person-months 2020 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-1.10) deaths per 100 000 person-months 2019 (incident rate ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, difference official covid toll excess death likely due combination undercount covid deaths people staying home instead seeking medical help, due fear catching virus, death **indirectly caused letting virus run rampant country** telling people it’s responsibility alone catch virus. likely due quarantines limitations travel Asia.

New Zealand mask mandates since September saw increase flu.

People Asian countries often wear masks public see decrease flu cases.

Rhinovirus impacted masks, social isolation travel restrictions. Right let's ditch military attack logic. Influenza go extinct even starved covid-19 style due animals also carrying strains cause illness people. fight flu struggle modern era means let up. (I almost killed 2009 pandemic Stand Steven King favorite novel. Fuck flu lol) someone explain still spread virus cant get infected it? 

I understand vaccine 95% effective, there's 5% chance could still become infected contagious. However, part 95%, body still spread it? saw comment earlier today saying true specific polio vaccine. got shot 6:30 pm woke like 8:30 symptoms, sure awake earlier would then. Started getting much worse around 10AM throughout whole day. Woke morning 9 fever headache mostly gone, still feel tired. managed reach 90% close 95% older age groups UK. know people opposed vaccines unfortunately, I'm really hoping get 80-85% pharmacies open. wtf employer lets take cat vet Company time. Serious question someone job might unionize soon. make sure union fighting good? I’m rather uneducated this. turns lot not.

I caught whooping cough age 25 aP part TDaP wears age 20 nobody told me. TD needs booster every ten years. Chicken pox? want booster turn 60 avoid shingles.

MMR requires series boosters throughout childhood, follow teens. Adults get titer done make sure immunity held up, there's nothing inherently bad getting booster vaccine records childhood.

However, major factor ""hopefully year"" boosters COVID vaccine would presumably tailored whatever variants circulating wild, unlike flu vaccine. Virginia resident, happy see this. Finally. Yup. friend mine went China, require viral anti body test prior entry apparently getting vaccine meant would’ve tested positive. fly SF first get done special lab could differentiate vaccine antibodies vs contracting covid responding someone called high school dropout. Keep attacking though.

I making claims, asking questions. everyone thread biologist doctor?

Also, Dunning Kruger is... fistbumped air read this. I'm bus atm, I'm getting funny looks care! could see happening time. I’m imagining future get annual covid &amp; flu shot time. wouldn’t first dual purpose vaccine. assessment wrong. now, indication we'll need annual shots. possible we'll discover people need booster point future. know yet. Furthermore, information gathered trial makes *less* likely needed anytime soon. Specifically, evidence high efficacy 6 months, evidence efficacy SA variant means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future.

Of course, future full unknowns. assuming bad outcome evidence support useful.  They’ll DEFINITELY asking see manager, alright Small sample says 91.3% efficacy 6 months. Still solid stay 80% least 1-2 years good spot. understand methodology. expose everyone vaccinated control group covid get numbers? didn't, went occurs nature, they're numbers data flawed. bike work, already getting plenty cardio lol, wanna feel strong again. understanding talks PI question still air. 

You correct mutated B cells part auto-immune disorders. Making self-reactive B cells affinity maturation usually easy part. B cell self-tolerance works checking initial B-cell binds self-protein. mutates, longer keeping B cells check. However, B cells need receive cell help germinal center. possible receptor binds virus self-protein still get cell help capturing virus. easily produced small, insignificant numbers.

What quite understand B cells get expanded significant numbers later. know must getting T-cell help outside germinal center, expanding rapidly. probably something self-reactive helper cells, self-reactive helper cells slip self-tolerance checks substantial enough numbers unknown. understand. Ya dingus I'll direct current stats NJ. vulnerable population anyone 45. rest us quite nicely vaccines (and prior cases) younger people horrorshow. happens happens everywhere next month. We'll probably administer multiple doses globally entire human population vaccine least (to give time stop community spread). 

I imagine global vaccination movement stop around 2022-2023. poorer countries take longer get vaccinated (unfortunately). BRAVE. Together, heard immunity strong. Quebec stopped using flu vaccines cases low.   Nah, thanks. handle much point. Even though everything similar made -- induced quite different response; Moderna higher Nab titer CD4+ Tcells low, best CD8+ Tcells thats enough meaningful. Pfizer lower Nab titer induced CD4+/CD8+ Tcells CD8+ virucidal component Tcell immunity (cd8=cytotoxic tcells kills infected cells) 

Incubation period Sarcov2 around 6-days, theres plenty time memory tcells reawaken eliminate infected cells. biggest difference two mRNA opinion Whaaaat?

Now timed money making ongoing vaccine? wish lived USA numbers projections like plus aren’t forcibly locked away 3rd fucking time Germany gave world 2 best vaccines! means dingleberry. Use head. already announced retirement last year COVID hit tf last stand? CDU probably beyond fucked point isn’t problem anymore Wouldn’t surprised hit 4m tomorrow. No, according Redding YouTube? (Oddly enough) 4th wave coming nothing stop it. scared. I'm hoping see another good rise 65+ vaccines prolific enough walk pharmacy get it. actually amazed managed vaccinate many age group already given hurdles distribution appointment making. True. true tf paying vaccines? Chill Finally! Excited finally able pick stuff feet! people love us, boggles mind read part CDC’s report linked plainly says ZERO (count again, ZERO) (one time, ZERO) evidence negative effects fertility? common sense CDC going give abundance caution, especially comes vulnerable state like pregnancy. several vaccines, medications, etc. contraindicated pregnant women. example, MMR vaccine, varicella, flu vaccines. covid vaccine may well remain one them. news, reason tout vaccine somehow unsafe. 

I get you’re saying. lot nurses young females may plan children. article isn’t that, female finds pregnant choice chance going aware certain things put body. practicing nurse world, vaccines required have. risk vaccine *no different* risk vaccine available. think thing recommending fully vaccinated people keep wearing masks public. That’ll make little threat spreading virus pose even lower help maintain social norm masking unvaccinated people. 

Everything else overkill honestly harmful considering long people socially isolated point. Guillian Barre 18 years ago, covid July handled problems. Taste symptom.  Wow, sounds like tough life. ..... Yeah you’re right. hope don’t get messed though. quickly get side effects Who's American values?

My American values Constitution say fine dandy. frank, think *most* people worried people access vaccination records worried *specifically because* want get vaccinated want judged activities restricted it, rather abstract concern privacy medical records. like... guess kind understand that? Personally would like everyone get vaccinated think shitty selfish get vaccinated, alternate universe genuinely felt like making health care decision best health people might disagree with, would upset forced reveal activities restricted it.

As remaining people *do* want get vaccinated *also* think huge burden major violation privacy, kind suspect lot combination actual term ""vaccine passport"" - evokes sort permanent universal ID used restrict travel business - fact *actually* specific policy proposal table indication limits would used long, people worrying going end sort government corporate ID become additional permanent fixture daily activities top already exists.

I think would help people talked concrete terms. Knicks required either show proof vaccination (CDC vaccine card digital representation) negative rapid test result get MSG game COVID case counts fell threshold, think people actually get vaccinated really seen huge burden majority people opposed getting vaccinated, could lead larger indoor events reopening quickly would kind nice. Long term, would surprised see proof vaccination required anything international travel attending school/college/university. I'm questioning logic, saying can't scream ""haha, Europe sucks US rules"" based vaccines one exporting July 4th US gonna absolutely LIT. Yeah know I’m willing accept risks vaccination availability widespread, anyone wants keep fuck miserable without trying make everyone else Yeah gunna say. flawed response allowed virus run rampant least save us probably month end this. think reach herd immunity next 2-3 weeks. cases drop cliff go. concerted effort move goalposts fall begun. Absolutely unbelievable. 

Children effected severely enough justify damage society via lockdowns. adults given opportunity get shot, it’s time reopen society pre-pandemic levels.

Call child killer, selfish ass, really don’t care. hold firm position. read enough know childhood COVID hysteria blown WAY proportion. politician drags past June July automatically loses vote support. South Africa sold AZ vaccines others want anymore, clearly much concern vaccination delay areas continent. former  Tetanus different though. tetanus vaccine prevent bacterial infection. toxoid trains body fight neurotoxin bacterial infection produces. get new tetanus shot step rusty nail even fully vaccinated before. 
 
An airborne virus much likely present environment small amounts bodies naturally continue make antibodies it. provisions FMLA CFRA employer cannot interfere employees need medical treatment. 
If medical reason miss work, documentation might needed can't fired. 
Paid sick leave, unpaid sick leave, etc different discussion altogether. would think folks would already vaccinated age. Isn’t second shot basically booster anyways worse side effects. would willing get vaccine drug companies liability damages. also would like wait year maybe two see anything comes worrisome. like recall something since new thing. Oh pete's sake.

Relax laugh every while. feel better. someone walking outside without mask means they're handing death sentences. 

Yea. LOT hysteria around still. Plus there's belief difference life death mask. ridiculous.

I found one neighbors houses **has left house year.** even once. even walked onto deck. TDI similar STD. don’t qualify STD haven’t company year. laid last year due covid found job. 

And yeah, backlash ridiculous. ended sick weeks back ended complications endoscopy (routine procedure!!) already reprimanded needing week strep. they’re urging us get vaccines, great can’t get mad people side effects. Ugh. Yay, go ahead treat unvaccinated people like lepers vaccinated proudly show immunity status app covid-bouncer door every indoor venue. matter know vaccines ticking time-bombs not. cares!  Short relatively easy schooling good chance making 6 figures. demand career lot days off. dont even need bachelor's. calling everyone. smart career choice. That's everything life dude. Nothing guaranteed, varying levels possible. million people 35. Yes test would carry less inherit risk injection. mean way physically hurt paperstrip test. Nvm, I’m sure someone would find way... Clever hour? updoot We’ll get polio; needs time.

Covid isn’t going anywhere unless vaccinate every wild mammal there. coronavirus. never is. Well really 450m, can't decide want use on. question long first second vaccination go second vaccination loses efficacy? Canada, there's shortage vaccines, people get vaccinated today told second shot four months. 

The prevailing opinion, believe, circumstances, better get people first shot get fewer people second shot. I'm sure feel that. Opinions? Uff  must sad realizing fucked parent hard lockdown, schools, universities, non-essential retailers closed, gatherings banned. means 50% full basically hitting upper limit partial vaccinations mid-June.

Israel hit 50% fully vaccinated. cases June trending now. Mmmm, Kimchi Companies, EU. EU havent signed contract anyone supply vaccines, private companies happen located within EU have. Reading wrote again, I'm sitting laughing brain made make sense. tell long immunity lasts tetanus vaccine? People Twitter going fucking crazy saying, ""It lasts 6 months?? even worth get need 4 shots every year!""

People infuriate me. Also rarely use Twitter. think absurdly unfair rich countries like UK EU members offload manufacturing difficulties poor countries. SII never supposed manufacture UK EU. India Covid outbreak deal with, billions people developing world depend India's vaccines.

I hear America spare AZ doses. Go bother them. can’t accurately say whether due waning antibodies, 91 percent efficacy still within confidence interval original study. completely possible variation original 85 percent efficacy first 2.5 months study 91 percent efficacy longer study due random chance Avoid reposting information. 10 million 450 million people.. really move needle. Reported Kimchi council Korea. policies like that. also work Christmas Eve mandatory evacuation hurricane I’m surprised. Interesting pedantry coming healthcare worker thinks anitbody titers sole metric whether booster needed. guess poor B cells irrelevant discussion 119 Swanson St. Rochestershire, Olde Yorke Yeah, going suggest same. Zofran legit-- even chemo stuff worked like charm me. I'm sure could fight lingering nausea OP might get vaccine. also pressuring India export second half 10 million doses ordered Serum, source originally supposed produce AstraZeneca vaccine low medium-income countries. see point, malaria good example. anti malarial medication prevent infection. We've studied malaria longer know efficacy various treatments. Also, death rate covid literally different order magnitude. Absolutely. Deliveries always problematic aspect. Many producers projected unfeasible amounts vaccine deliveries upon delivery. lying, it’s “our good?” That’s BS.

Well no, BS. several lies ""for good.""

- ""Healthy people need wear masks."" early lie. said people hoarding CASES medical-grade masks hospitals running them.

- ""Your mask protect you, protects everyone else you."" lie number 2, ""for good."" lie allowed people pressure wear masks. goal increase usage.

- ""Even though vaccinated, may still spread need wear mask."" Another lie ""for good."" knew said ""Once vaccinated quit wearing mask"" people would say vaccinated quit wearing them.

This single biggest problem experts. see right BS they've lost credibility. Got it. Yeah last two points. Tetanus bad worth considering booster since know protection fades time. true. We’re fortunate government hoarded all, guess? 

That’s whole moral failing. Wut m8 Yea accurate. really matter calls it. Bacterial Tetanus mutate.

The booster recommended every 10 years know long immunity lasts Tetanus shot, side effects vaccine incredibly low, potential risks actually getting tetanus horrific. None 3 viruses transmissible nature humans animals. lack animal reservoir makes variants much less likely. iirc, tetanus boosters vaccine toxin, pathogen, right? wonder they're referring clinical trial studies first vaccinations EUA FDA. CA CA much liberal many policies states. norm, it’s not. Viruses also outcompete other, leaving infection reservoirs flu spread. true, memory cells always live forever longevity complex still lot study.

Just upvoted mean right 

-PhD Immunology People arlready vaccinated shots able work certain businesses schools. can't imagine mean walk retail would hard make happen.  Yeah, contracts say ""the first 160 million ours!"". 100% failure though?

Depends motive, whether turns hypocritical. actually followed sentiment vaccine nationalism? no, failure, quite admirable.  
 
But claim sign morally superior engage vicious vaccine nationalism, blocking contracts later date anyway, Germany currently doing, rather meaningless stupid get initial ""these first doses us"" deal, since longer claim morals excuse. Sounds like nothing controlled well. sucks. :( Hope gets better soon y'all. what? (I even know trying say there).

I'm lost cause trusting advice expertise people understand far better armchair enthusiasts reddit? agree. Benefits US abysmal. People allowed sick! point they'll probably information much (hopefully) longer holds up. there's proved drop efficacy, they'll probably plan booster, assume would one shot, kinda like second dose. propaganda worked. Lots people actually okay that, far tell. WW2 level deaths &lt; applebees vaccine, happy anyone wants received I'm sure good vaccine lot vulnerable right body autonomy. Nobody force anyone take medication want taught informed consent think would need change law could force people leave course two years anti-vaccine. children classmates taken vaccine already, discussed them, heard many say choice. Nobody forced.

Above every single quote person said. Please explain one false misinformation. Also I’m troll, dismiss don’t like I’m saying pretty pathetic. LOL @ FauciOuchie true. companies located EU member states exported far least 77 million doses. Although works , hope reSearch improved 2.0 version times go Norovirus birds. went fine one minute vomiting continuously 24 straight hours. Yes opposite🤣 Also, sorry bad reaction. suck feel shitty take time either way! UK never got lockdowns testing right (catastrophically wrong fact) bet big &amp; early vaccines, refuses join side effects hysteria.

Germany needs cut shit direct entire state apparatus get many vaccines many arms possible. Hence inclusion word ""Modified"". Yes please tell infectious disease experts back envelope calculations Reddit!

I agree hypothesis we’re going see steep drop next couple months, that’s inconsistent idea still save 10s thousands lives stricter couple weeks now. Somewhat yeah. Obviously deaths take longer we’ve learned people risk Covid generally (not always) cautious. younger cohort (college students instance) contributes significantly rise cases area multiple generations (4 days rolling infection chains) spread eventually work way homes, workplaces, next generations family unit. hospitalizations rise, deaths course follow.  

Our observation hope decoupling cases negative outcomes.  know happen eventually.  question places like MI experiencing spike “Are enough shots arms right make impact Covid less typical previous outbreaks Covid?” live? Approval slow Pfizer Moderna vaccines.

Pfizer Moderna approved EMA 10 19 days US FDA approved them. Moderna's deliveries Europe small initially, significant one Pfizer. That's ten-day delay. cause problem, limited availability doses is. There's sick pay that's covered government too. think requires 3+ days kicks in. much. hurts.. right &lt;pointing even get vaccine sick cancer? I'm staying locked every person world vaccinated, happen. actually vaccines animals there's huge question mark whether yearly boosters needed. 

While rabies states huge concern ofnour mammalian friends, vaccine possibly effective without need boosters year year every years depending type. 

Tetanus weird one addition every ten years, they'll give one without second thought we'll ten year booster sometimes flood waters etc. get Microsoft side effects all, Word it.

I disappointed got back Office nothing different.

Still vaccine apparently Excel stopping virus suppose grateful given Access it. asked question, answered it.

Sorry answer inconvenient narrative. folks know who’ve gotten two shots experienced severe side effects second. poor aunt ass week temp 103. 

I got Pfizer vaccine (fortunate would gotten either know less reported side effects second shot) really really hoping second one isn’t bad. But, can’t control happens lol scheduled Friday I’m hoping return work Monday.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  True, science complete, mean proven safe. mean 'gaslighting'? science complete either, complete enough know safe.

And besides, J&amp;J shot full FDA authorization either.

Why refusing vaccines? They're massively safer taking chances COVID.  I'm already fully immune. Society work way.  still need protect people pandemic over. LMAO understand distrust, mit see fixed quickly. It’s education issue unfortunately communities badly basic higher education. think best chance would doctors community talk them.

Making vaccines available taking use anyone. weird part lead higher production efficiency. [The FDA ever invoked EUA 6 COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, MERS, H1N1, Anthrax.

EUA good classification use, since quite rare limited scope. would instead look far mRNA vaccine progressed phased trials. 

mRNA vaccines around since 1989. renal cell carcinoma mRNA vaccine progressed phase 3 trials 1995 (which abandoned due lack efficacy, safety). HIV mRNA vaccines progressed phase 1 2, well. 

We consistently found various mRNA vaccines safe humans differing levels scale. nearly 600m successful vaccine administrations enough convince safety, know anything will... far worst (look japan)

This true. Americans work average japanese. may true one point, while. Stop spreading  I'd say dumbest time catch covid. I'd feel like total dumbass caught like couple weeks I'm able get vaccine avoiding year (luckily personally already one dose soon 2).  curious see happens, think soon, like next weeks, areas see vaccines piling unused. inform encourage people can't make take it. wonder ship around different states demand, ship overseas. hate say could definitely envision international black market it.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understand “exceedingly rare” means? lotteries casinos better odds that. Emergency Use Authorization mostly means massive paperwork done. Pfizer submitting full authorization month, expected receive summer early fall.

Meanwhile health care workers refuse vaccine legit medical reasons get rekt. Yeah, it’s definitely semantics, think may see people “shutting down” arguments it’s people sub’s opinion science led us easy personal decision. vaccines work very, well, they’re safe. personally don’t see too, much discuss beyond that, course people gonna concerns, that’s totally fine concerned ask questions! whatever want. Totalt agree this. think ""collapse"" may refer time point hospitals/health care system turn patients hospital's door step. 

I think collapse anyways stupid term binary - gradual, we've often seen high patient numbers lowers overall care (with increasing case fatality rate consequence). quite yet. statement ""we're going start treating like flu RIGHT NOW""--it's future outlook.  support continuing wearing masks public everyone wants one chance receive vaccine, though

This point post. There's people can't get right now, still distancing wearing masks Covid dangerous currently is.

Saying ""the pandemic two weeks second shot,"" true.  False positives negatives happen, something like 5-20% time. tests unfortunately 100% accurate. Yeah right hypothesized anywhere 6-8 months 1-2 years booster needed. Europe exported vaccines country region.

I see hypocrisy. India says no, entirely within right. That's figured seems like that's people did. Yeah, people already ""excess death"" measurements. useful get 70-80-90% vaccinated.. 

then less important. little while. I'd expect couple years least air travel rest world vaccinated. know meming, implications *190 years* immunity would pretty sweet. Probably *a lil' bit* chaos meantime, population numbers would remain sustainable levels it'd truly new era


;-) seems people doses Pfizer vaccine carry virus, mean impossible spread it? I'm living fear. many people are. lot sub One theory virus could get onto part body carry it, immune system attack it, mucous membranes hair skin something. then, theoretically, could remain alive viable while, could shed spread someone else.

I doctor scientist anything seems incredibly implausible me, seem pretty sure virus spread contaminated surfaces kind thing seems way me. I've read. general, vaccinated person cannot spread COVID significant amount. Nothing 100%, vaccines approved US block spread. Yes also social distance almost extreme, bars, person shopping, dine restraunts, going parties them, staff hopefully careful family friends visit/see Replying worlds worst fortune teller point COVID killed 1,138 people yesterday US. Congratulations wrong. could said ""Wuhan virus"". spread detected. easy: get shot need mask anymore Get times, homie. Buzzfeed News released Pulitzer prize nominated stories incredible investigative journalists. relatively short tenure, George Polk Award, Sidney Award, National Magazine Award National Press Foundation award, well finalist Pulitzer Prizes. Maybe problem write self righteous assholes instead understanding we’re similar realize.

we'd lock U.K. successful going regular doctors elderly patients. anyone know Novavax taken long bring vaccine market? ever deliver 10 million doses Department Defense? signed contract last June: Wrong. also 4 new cases Hawaii, plus others instances elsewhere across world. talking fully vaccinated. 

Once take consideration vaccinating billions, even statistically small percentages, add up.  Yep, think people quite understand yet revolutionary mRNA vaccines are. Let go man. stuff obvious, real world info proving it. put one 3 month mark, release information extremely critical information general population know. already struggle get people vaccinated misinformation there. posted show confirmed least lasts 6 months.

And come along, reading article, title, saying lasts 6 months ""officially"" people **have** get booster 6 months. That's false. Entirely. statements. Jesus every sub lol 6 cases B.1.351, placebo arm. Assuming arms equal size using Bayesian reasoning uniform prior [Pfizer's ""theta"" gives efficacy estimate 86% 95% credible interval 31-100%. [Here's Desmos visualization; note x 𝛩 variable convert via good news, exactly enough data sure from.

Related: [an outbreak B.1.351 Colorado prison 3+ weeks appears completely halted giving 85% inmates first dose unspecified vaccine. first dose fine. super tired slept like baby, side effects. second dose put ass. planned least work shift day got it, two hours appointment started feeling absolutely winded ended going work hour early help daytime crew close kitchen went home felt like pure garbage two days stop felt breath exhausted whole week after.

You're right tho, still better catching covid. great question: idea, flu shot also never heavily pushed quite like Covid vaccine commenter said, ""Who vaccinated people need protect?"" answered. everyone vaccinated anti-vaxxer. child vaccinated 2022 that's even get vaccinated ongoing cancer treatment. stay locked forever, people wear damn mask herd immunity achieved. study Walensky referring to: CDC director says it, good enough me. Vaccine total efficacy vs COVID 19 different efficacy vs variants. 91% already lower earlier reported 95% due circulation different variants. still good news, data contradict earlier studies.  I'm doctor easily see 50%, especially fact 11 states, Monday allowed full access. also think, based numbers supply thought would be. think there's question, nationally get 50% adults easily immunized. That's front-line workers others can't. also see posts still getting shots availability social media. 

I'm bit concerned vaccination going mean. Israel shows work, but, right we've plateaued country best. Yes, 40% adults first shot, great news (over age 18), still 6 weeks shot get full protection. hear variants now, always been, comes mutation, 6 weeks two (like J&amp;J) could big deal.

Depending means, nearly 16.9% two doses, could half (I know means). still might seeing full effect vaccine yet. Anecdotally everyone know gotten shot choice. think logistics would difficult gave everyone choice would expect picked you. know. double think insane role UN deal humanitarian crises. can’t let thousands people die allow new variants form infect rest world. Yep many European nations disaster too. Brazil one. Haha, thanks! want rule out, clearly know things work. honest dont fully understand argument amendment applying private companies.

Well, pretty easy look shall make law** respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; right people peaceably assemble, petition government redress grievances.

The first amendment applies government, private entities. pretty specific. mockdown. Thanks DoFo.. expertise vaccine design guess I'd say would likely get two shots time instead bundle. streamlined cost effective infrastructure generating flu vaccines (involving growth eggs, kinda cool actually) find likely switch different strategy cheap is.

Now company may decide sell one shot mRNA would still road since mRNA vaccines flu gone trials.

It's likely complicated mixing two probably multiple different companies involved would make complicated. may need trial giving time even, would think ok. TURTLE. dangers would potentially happen. would change philosophy public engagement Covid infections.  

Transmissible viral loads seem occur bell curve biggest peak day symptom onset number days that. Overall tests (if remember correctly) something 80 accuracy kicked contention.  Yet peak 80% accurate. Check Dr. Mina’s appearances podcasts fir exact numbers. 

Basically philosophy could get people likely “go wild” go wild 5 days turns dark color could nullify TON spread. Also skeptical result cheap enough could take one every 24 hours (or sooner) cut false negatives. 

Having hand would helpful change behavior without need send anything government. think even skeptical people don’t really want show somewhere knowingly spread Covid. 

There applications well. 

This could interesting part school opening honor system testing protocol would probably help ripple cutting community spread. 

Example: grade cohorts (example: 8 grade a&amp;b) sample pool test Friday mornings. Cohort 8b throws positive pool test... Saturday contacted via automated system. 7 rapid tests hand ahead time per student part return plan schools.  lick strip every morning. It’s clear get bus. It’s stay home questions asked. possibly incentive (no clue carrot offer opposed stick).

I know sounds idealistic think would work compliant places like North East Pacific NW. 

Its pretty interesting think things reality hodgepodge state systems various philosophical approaches Covid. ones really need targeted people anxiety. 

I know several people aren’t anti-vaccine read horrible things “the experts” Pfizer data leak, claiming there’s chance mRNA cause prions it’s degraded leak supposedly revealed happening. Idk. 

But anxiety, cannot get past that. It’s like flight fight mechanism brain. 

Idk help honestly.  Europeans continuing act like they're superior rest world, wonder smug commenters thinking now? bet even admit dumb, they'll come mental gymnastics justify takes back then... Yes, let's ignore experts data say covid much effect children got cold nephew. American, I’m sure agree this.  get round one 7 hours pfizer shot. makes really happy No, tested larger smaller doses phase II trial, landed 100μg dose based phase II results.

There definitely benefits larger dose. phase II results:

[An mRNA Vaccine SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report | booster trial single dose booster contains mRNA spikes new varients, well boost original spikes. requires giving private company medical information. UK, proposals vaccine passports scan venue. way hell that. invasive, want something even theoretically used track me. Yeah got first Pfizer vaccine Tuesday, way locking again.  totally norm lots companies... directors higher execs making big bucks. used called human without OCD. Hmm, clarify, you’re saying negative covid antibodies (like ones you’d getting infected covid), antibodies that’d created result vaccine, right? \~6.7 Million adults NYC. \~4.1 Million first doses already administered [according I'll generously assume 1 million doses people living outside city limits coming in. let's say 3 Million NYC adults begun vaccination, that's already 44% adults. Then, factor [\~27% city got infected last year, Lets assume half people overlap vaccinated people, \~13% population ""previously protected"" . already puts us around 57% adults NYC form immunity. 30+ eligibility opened 2 days ago, 16+ opens 5 days, plus supply increasing, etc. reasonable 2-3 weeks hitting immunity threshold. Now, mean cases immediately plummet, Israel likely hit immunity threshold weeks ago, takes time virus fizzle out.  Oh absolutely. think people told information know, decide feel risks involved. Especially something wide spread top everyone's mind. noted type cell like different segment US military, ground, air, sea, they're working together serious infections, differing levels various infection types, like antibodies what's needed, killer cytotoxic t-cells. healthy robust response infection like one causes Covid-19 hands deck.  think made statement yet, early tell.

Pfizer said vaccine protects variants. expect similar case moderna j&amp;j? def agree right choose , think scientific evidence-based decision. certainly one blamed hesitant feeling afraid right now! central vaccination registry NY use power app? Like go CVS ""pass"" automatically available app, need upload vaccine card. 

I like ohio I'm curious. say otherwise. two weeks isn’t immediate. It’s matter believe, it’s numbers. Buddy, believe know ironic unfortunate mean. need define. 

Ironic, folks close vaccinated came it. Shall put gallows humor parenthesis? 

Unfortunate unfortunate take meaning unlucky. 

Nowhere say wasn’t putting strain medical workers. said is, fact, worst time hospital. You’re changing argument completely addressing said turtle knows ONE SECRET behind defeating coronavirus.

Ventilators hate him!   absolutely agree. would gladly masked people wearing masks.  Even export ban side US would still entitled doses has, paid advance know things start look good U.S., seriously consider limiting travel rest world while, least implement STRICT contact tracing like Singapore, NZ, etc. That’s actually insane. hell weren’t wearing masks least vilifying before. 

Should interesting see numbers stack future especially vaccines rolling out. 2021 compared 2019 interesting. think 2022 compared 2019 even better comparison since assume lockdowns mandates lifted then. 

I also can’t speak others never got flu shots past year people age group I’m sure help reduce numbers. part though first studying blood COVID survivors people vaccinated, immunologists learning immune system cells—which remember past infections react them—might abilities change, countering mutations virus. means, scientists think, immune system might evolved way dealing variants.

It makes somatic hypermutation sound like new thing. I've explaining specific phenomenon friends calm fears covid variants little, helps. phrasing established scientific ideas tentative terms undersells trustworthy claim actually is. vaccines safe effective. dont think would want test im shy ask retest im union call whenever want without sick time left. Coming work sick getting others sick kind shitty thing do, honest. Same! Since kiddo husband recurrent strep, sinusitus, name it. Ugh. Michigan.... 

Michigan opened level country opened since may. 

AND still mask mandate. No, prove unsafe, can’t push restrictions vaccinated people dirty disgusting before? can’t believe you’d get vaccine experimental *they don’t even know long lasts*. Why? what's that? Definitely, know people otherwise pro-vaccine skeptical vaccine. lot understanding trusting made vaccine fast. come around recently, tho. Peer pressure works ad campaign hopefully help too. We’re already seeing vaccine hesitancy decrease across country, according polls That's [the :) Oh look anecdotal evidence I’m supposed believe said saw it. prove way around vaccinated people serious risk. available evidence says that’s case reality know safe vaccination. know safe initial infection. I'm ""moving goal posts"". I'm stating information given use scientists, researchers doctors. People want, throw untrue info unfair. Well it’s good thing scientific community confirmed government saying case. know. know asked wanted continue trial said yes. 100% calling phase III trial. That’s point though, it’s fine stop gap long term place said able honestly forgot everyone go back work someday LOL thinking store, etc. ironic work i'm healthcare worker never stopped going work irl lol  country disgrace. 91% effective like wearing full body armor get shot face still die. 

60% like wearing bullet proof vest battle helmet. Still plenty places get shot, still pretty good. 

No vaccine like running war zone tits hanging out, hoping they'll distract people shooting you. I'm pretty sure that's illegal. Talk local citizens advice bureau. Everyone comments here, remember phase 3 trials started little six months ago. smh use heads people. name one country America, ill wait. May introduce wonder union? I’ll rude anyone think rationally acceptable risk hu? mean US wants use vaccines paid money...*on citizens?*... dystopia april fool not, I'm buying Pfizer stock. agree fewer people dying younger patients hospitalized, addition better treatments, yes. time, really make current problem less problem thousands healthcare workers treat them. Especially numbers growing fast clip. unfortunate, yes. 

To fair, calling (which often imparts sardonic humor) (meaning unlucky) bit callous/dismissive reality situation. PLEASE end variant hysteria open international travel? get COVID test feel better, negative safe maybe post antivax propaganda? Right. don’t share individual blood analysis results participants - misunderstood comment. anecdote went 2 separate antibody tests labcorp getting second shot negative. think anyone knows sure, phase 3 trial planned late summer (1 year Phase III trial started) would assume looking December-Jan rollout, like main vaccine? Fuck no, unless deaths hospitalizations go roof people never take seriously U.S again, many never did. States already opening back repealing mask mandates, sure hope enough people get vaccine otherwise dealing quite time. Interesting, makes sense, thank you.

I love people excited subject :) Seems like starting learn lesson US learned... Lockdowns literally nothing. States open better numbers states closed. virus going wants. Tetanus shots give sore arm. got Tdap two weeks ago. gave full body chills, headache, soreness over, process exhausting.

Still worth tho. Yeah, Americans get that. want to. take pride working 80 hours week boss finds loophole pay OT. brag it. gross. leaky vaccine. makes sense. point. *headline* accurate said doses Oh cute. Rudeness hostility. Good conversation.  know asking ridiculious question

Money. Page views, clicks, ad impressions. Locking November hold made sense, locking would one worst ideas imaginable.  least? You’re telling want everyone get vaccine barely know anything about? implying vaccines significantly reduce risk getting symptomatic covid, helpful. 

I literally never said anything sort. best vaccines 94-96% efficacy. Work culture brainwashed American society far worst (look japan), pretty toxic. form mental warfare play trying guess employer react. Cause right something would leave name list negatively effect career long run. really insane.... Then, hopefully, find another employer fire taking time health 6 months.

And mean sound cold, mean, boss shitty asshole, start looking new job. Yes article says millions New Yorkers gotten vaccinated begun enjoy taste life pandemic, many like Ms. Bertolino remained stuck home. Wheelchair-bound eyesight fading, Ms. Bertolino considered vaccine appointments unattainable, hidden behind impenetrable tangle eligible vaccination since January, 42 percent New Yorkers 85 older fully vaccinated, according recent city data, jolted community groups action. Jewish organizations, fact age group includes many Holocaust survivors — community’s vulnerable treasured members — created all-hands-on-deck emergency. Excessive hygien suspected triggering autoimmune diseases. Vaccination strengthen immune system exposes pathogens (in controlled way), excessive hygiens weaken immune system protecting almost pathogens. fine got incredibly sleepy first shot. Long feel fine alert, say workout issue. question PhD -

Is possible bundle future Covid booster run-of-the-mill annual flu shot limit jabs? I’ve vaccinated. worry people unlike sub That’s right. people right speak freely, naturally misinformation posted.

I support vaccination. vaccinated. also support free flow information, even it’s truthful. Big Tech suck dick. Media form right controlling flow information.  government really thought could hide us smh. Pfizer announced vaccine actually thousands tiny turtles inject blood stream.  ITT : EU apologists everywhere. EU logic. UK though.

I think countries do. Or...

Just maybe...

They data 6 months vaccinating absolute dingus.

Once 7 months, update.

Once 3 years, update.

Some people think know better always get baited bs articles mean data pointing towards vaccines stopping giving others even comfortable taking chances wouldn’t nice peace mind could around risk groups without spreading it? 0 faith Ox/AZ booster reason, unless use different vector even (and informed people) would rather take mRNA even means waiting month two that'ssss interesting question. idea. think they've even tried. 2nd Pfizer yesterday. Whoop whoop! Or...

Just maybe...

""It found 20 individuals study developed T-cells recognised spike protein Sars-CoV-2 virus 10 days receiving first dose mean theory enough needle sticks 6 months people immunity outlast infectious period covid, 6 months plenty Man get back work? feel like crap less productive longer period time still sick going sick even longer let get better sooner. Nahh definitely part problem. work sick, getting less work done longer period time getting ahead like think is. Got first Moderna right arm Massachusetts Grocery Worker today. IOW woo long covid vaccines came along. flu drastically social distancing, mask wearing, general hesitation getting close people drastically cuts viral reproduction. reason coronavirus cases drastically limited instead spreading exponentially perpetuity 100% population virus.

no not. shitty job full time.

part time workers get access benefits like paid time off, 401k, benefits. full time workers usually get 40 hours year paid vacation use whatever reason 40 hours medical leave used medical reasons. top earn hours paid based hours worked stacks 40 non medical mentioned. ratio basically 8 hours worked= 2 hours vacation leave accumulated.

You apply Forced Medical Leave Absence, medical leave use protects job. get paid. dont get fired either offer hours back medical leave over. thought JJ shot 70% effective? assumption well. 

We still monitored person appointments / blood tests monitor anti-body count. Well science still rather patchy regard masks, particularly consider non-health professionals necessarily wearing things correctly, often, etc. Look Florida, mask mandate pretty well, least worse places mask mandates. 

But nevertheless. 

Point find highly questionable vaccines still researched, trials finished, anyone takes effectively takes part trial push onto (or rather) people violation Nuremberg Code. can't understand people ignoring simple fact. part trust reports saying vaccines brilliant safe prevent infection etc. seems bit good true, given they're planning us part database prove infectivity status. despise idea kind class divide. worse class divide fact. based people's health. Can't get discriminatory that. 

The vaccines might great safe rest may well turn worst agenda humanity ever managed push. simply know data. So, would take vaccine? Ask 2023, they've completed trials. I'm actually speechless. absurd level stupidity. Saying ""at east 6 months,"" could mean amount time higher half-a-year. me, imbecile? I.e., vaccine's efficacy could stretch 6 months 1 day, said, 5 years, decade, 30 years, etc.  Murphy bother lifting restrictions increasing capacity limits things like stadiums indoor venues shut down. believe anything else lifted near future, that's big difference going back lockdown like last spring. One 1.4k stimulus check nothing live of. Please spread information unless backed. lot fellow Germans surprised reach herd immunity early July. concerned reports small percentage COVID cases following fully vaccinated, wondering people better understanding may cause.

The vaccines 100% effective, simple that. include DC neighbors? vaccination effort been....... Great What? pay work. Miss enough work fire you. free employers forced keep someone employed? work, get paid. don’t work, get fired. prognoses EMA approval curevac, novavax sputnik v? look far see mental gymnastics. entirely US UK's fault (predictably) engaging ""vaccine nationalism"", paradoxically, time totally fine EU rips contracts steals doses. None ever EU's fault, naturally. would assume so. essentially same. Makes sense. also looking projected allocation J&amp;J various states week April 5 covered 5M. Wonder kept rest weeks April might part federal pharmacy program. LAND FREEE! elves HATE US! can’t fit vaccine importance papers nursing theories Florence Fucking Nightingale. good 75% nursing school pointless fluff, lies problem. 

An unspoken “nursing theory” people born without ability critically think. people able pass NCLEX. Sangamon County (Springfield) open 16+ Sounds like goal constantly vaccs needle arm keep alive along needle bank account drawing money pay vaccs. They’re also pretty short-sided won’t give little time couple shots avoid possibility two weeks Covid. lord's work popping egos nationalistic Europeans. quite worrying many reddit, considering evil consider nationalism present nations. Thanks awards, appreciate you. said yesterday they’re applying approval 12-15 age group next weeks I'd get paid statutory sick pay, £95 week, required UK law. Ha. Pfizer.

Eric Feigl-Ding guy seems worst this. twitter feed nothing fear mongering stuff. get it. Son 15 still looks like months completing trials approval. Indeed. £95 week, enough anything really, certainly nowhere close rent anyway.

I'm young, I'm okay, think older current job. I, god forbid, cancer, thought 4 sick days quite frankly absurd. parents cancer, required treatment, that's certainly stress want hanging you. Even critical illness cover cover illnesses keep work.

Before job, pretty made terms sick pay, actually realise legal minimum required employer SSP. really feel end situations actually causes real struggle. It’s completely appropriate criticize nurses stepping lane spewing medical advice they’re qualified for.

This true, appropriate criticize *not doctors.* I've studied turtles extensively degree, see flair. certainly rare turtle-like varient. studies needed.  deep level kindergarten humor sub Bolsonaro terrible human democratically elected. Anyway virus care politics.  sure shit dont. Bring UBI social change champion it. you? need 2 vaccines complete round. Two vaccines every 6 months equals 4 year Americans lucky medical insurance 14 days total year, including national holidays. PAs masters degrees. NPs used masters they’re doctorate. Yes, think flu lol. sick literally affect anyone. part problem?

I'm sitting ass seven days neglecting job common flu. take couple days worst man get back it, pass. sounds like big baby honestly Amazing it?

We jump every hoop possible prevent Covid deaths 2020, amazing amount collateral damage process.

Meanwhile, heart disease cancer killed people still buy one sources every street corner nationalist narrative EU created (and Europeans blindly accepted without critical thought) they've charitably given ""their"" doses away nonsensical even worth addressing anymore. Nationalists want listen facts. 
 
But I'll point even EU stole doses themselves, would barely make dent rollout would still slow. bit self-reflection find reasons slow rollout blaming literally anyone else world *but* people responsible European vaccination program. Vector based vaccines particularly bad boosters. even great second dose, Sputnik uses two different vectors j&amp;j one shot. ""good 6 months"" ""good fot least 6 months"" likely much longer. wouldn’t bad. I’ve gotten flu shot annually ever since got pneumonia flu also caused fatigued fell asleep facedown library, it’s super easy process. Pretty sure master's level become NP know sure. Since everyone becomes eligible tomorrow, one vaccine rest, empirically? India low percentage population 60. cares anymore rules

That's probably big part undergoing 3rd wave that's going get worse.

You get ignoring rules they're prolonging pandemic, right? LOL - talking point. way going 5 months restrictions. told parent child cancer care die, I'm problem? absolutely ridiculous. someone misses 89 shifts year wouldn’t able fire them? That’s twice week someone call claim sickness. hard to, given he's speaking English. Geeze louise, MD late party. No, asserting DONT KNOW there's level risk yet. saying people scared. saying accurate information. 

Clearly disagree issue. think value different things. got first shot Pfizer vaccine, go back couple weeks second one. half mile sister got vaccinated big cemetery husband 40 years best friend buried. Died covid 19, November 2020.

People dumb hell blow chance get vaccinated especially since covid mutating even stronger, contagious forms.

Maybe bury loved ones change minds. taking thing waaaaaaay literal. Washington state report 1.5 million vaccinated 102 tested positive shot.

Covid cases people don’t want shot don’t care numbers. Covid Thank you, great show. Mild cases low viral load, making less contagious. Really looking like things going kill asymptomatic spread people get shots. understanding there's delay doses handed federal government counted distributed states CDC reports.

I think 11 million delivered earlier week Federal government, yet reported delivered. There's article last week indicating [11 million set delivered articles earlier week J&amp;J met delivery commitment March. good safe effective vaccine approved children, idea somehow pandemic would unending get enough children vaccinated makes sense. Pandemics come gone countless times human history. first one ever end sooner thanks vaccination. somehow impossible vaccinate kids we'd reach level herd immunity among infections, ideal grand scheme things low risk compared dangers world even common infectious diseases.

Had everyone low risk COVID kids unlikely we'd done much anything prevent spreading. wave though? could argue US never left it’s first wave. There’s ebb flow going on, small large, attributed people prevent covid spread. California get RealID-certified drivers license need show tax returns, 

This 100% true. got mine CA show 2x (I think) proof current address something like utility bill, something proof like passport. Maybe something else, remember. show tax return... , making likely good adequate 12 months

So people down-voting suggestion annual Covid vaccinations required?

That downvoting saying things like ""your assessment wrong - may need booster shot that's it."" I'm curious, anything read online this? I'm Norway, last priority (I take serious immunosuppressants autoimmune disorder, understand I'm among top risk factor groups) seen general FHI timeline. It’s pretty harsh compared lockdowns worldwide. already form P1 ZA prevalence growing Good question. I'm sure union set up, I'm teacher union there's multiple ways get involved. Like large bureaucratic organization, union potential become corrupted serve best interests reports - union members stay involved keep everyone accountable. union, I'm member house reps, policy making board votes various matters union business. Also, school site chapter chair, represents worksite goes district wide chapter chair meetings union, keep union informed issues. also educators sit negotiating team time negotiate new contract agreement district. last thing vote. union leadership elections find candidates platforms plan lead union. union leadership made former educators, good know they've least experience us moved current jobs.

Like said, union I've ever apart - I'm sure set - take one thing away post would GET INVOLVED make sure union working YOU. union's job represent rights concerns, worker's let know concerns whenever rights violated.

What Mr. Bourla said completely consistent point. shots *may* need given annually, based whether scientific evidence shows waning immune response significant population recipients. trial demonstrates immune response still high 6 months, making likely good adequate 12 months. Thus, possibility fall precipitously next 6 months, also possible, based results, increasingly probable, last 12 months. time, rigorous scientific analysis, tell. mean, think that’s whole point...that, making progress vaccines, country still vaccinated. larger percentage populace covered, it’ll fine.  German government guarantee large supply MRNA vaccines next 2-3 months makes sense. can't, idiotic. fucking kidding right? [A LOT people used modern sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines. survived race, individuals suffered.

And Sweden low population density, using example ANYTHING stupid. true economics try epidemiology. Also, CEOs Pfizer Johnson Johnson already said expect likely need annual Covid vaccinations several would expect anything different Coronavirus? four coronaviruses endemic human population regularly reinfect us. polarized lockdown means shutdown corner.

forcing people stuff like take drugs good idea long encourage enough people take vaccine voluntarily, wont worry fringe amount take it. hell vaccine 95% effective pretty safe full stop.

there's also fact whilst fortunately rare, drugs work intended sometimes.


anyway, pretty sure I've sene people medical community say forced vaccinations bad idea, even without forcing vaccinations seems counter effective me, force people something, they'll idea causes problems resistance. True, still cautious next days! Pfizer vaccine takes 7 days second dose develop full effects vaccine.

And go Dr good health insurance. get large bill, hundreds dollars seen 10 minutes.

So yeah, getting sick week really devastate person. Good. 😇 Flu shots often free insurance. Even without vaccine. That's good news. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I downvote you. Whereas employers like that, situation commonplace America.

You'd hard pressed find employer let take due sickness. supervisors would rather single person miss days lose several people one asshole came sick half floor out. Hell, ask, tell person sick coming in, job offers PTO days, get docked.

The bigger problem allowed take day off, able miss day's income pay low.

Hang tight mate 👍 makes happy contract signed new company. get 120 hours year difference sick days vacation time. I've told others work they're really good honoring 120 hours require reason day, simple email supervisor taking day off. entirely recall. think dentists filling cavity, least. complaints people appointments recently say none staff wearing them, assume certain procedures still did. Maybe not, though.

The sad thing main dentist retired right covid protégé took practice over. 4 generations family gone guy retired careful, nice dentist. cool son go dentist great-grandma went alive.  
 But, sadly, apparently protégé could care less patients he's longer answerable boss.

Since dentistry requires unmasked patient drilling creates significant amount aerosols, dentists people need taking extremely seriously.

For example:

"" found using air turbine drill types, common type dental drill, creates dense clouds aerosol droplets spread fast 12 metres per second quickly contaminate entire treatment room. one milliliter saliva infected patients contains 120 million copies virus, capacity infect. know that. can't missed profession needs particularly careful, right? vocally uber conservative, never issue before, guess that's world now... wonder whether medical professional's political views going compromise care.

There's much still learn immunity works.  also would concerned Russian/Chinese vaccine, neither released full datasets even knows data isn’t fabricated, least slightly

That's paranoia completely unfounded. mention reeks xenophobia. reasoning also circular. Sputnik V's trial results peer-reviewed. ""But maybe gave Lancet fixed data, give us raw data"". That's contradictory. trust data gave scientists working lancet, convinced raw data fixed well. simply refusing accept Russian vaccine safe efficacious simply Russian. That's sad we're fortunate people like position make decisions approval purchase vaccines. true perception? I'm sure shitty employers like pretty accommodating let know what's going on. supervisors understand creating shitty work environment also hurts operation company.

Statistically, really can't say much all, claim FDA would accept. exploratory analysis, nine strains sequenced six nine confirmed B.1.351 lineage. Nope, contribute creation new versions virus, eventually require new vaccines.

I'd say keeping finicky cells alive thriving 1000L sterile vat pretty damn hard well.. Maybe trails that’s right trails Canon claim printer ink invented years ago last 300 years going bad? people like point facts made agreement began flow money, left details like specific number doses vague signed agreement based options later. 

Still EU signed deal specified number doses UK signed contract specified number doses really Astrazeneca fulfilling contract. Even way around still Astrazeneca's fault delivering said would. 


If buy something company arrived certain timeframe, said company clear ordered first I'm getting paid for. still agreement you, still fulfill promise.

The idea sign contract first entitled earliest deliveries nothing short idiotic (I'm aware one making claim), unless contract signed EU clause specificially says UK priority. Great. I’ll stop wearing mask given I’m fully vaccinated. excuse emergency orders vaccinations reach critical mass WANT it. don’t own. think alot people rush judgement issue seems way complicated really understand point without data.

This pretty much entire point I'm trying make put simply. Like, can't say ""Texas lifted restrictions numbers going up, even restrictions?"" thought implied guy, maybe reading much it. seems pretty obvious restrictions like mask mandates work people actually abide them. one thing say country world (besides mentioned) better getting/giving shots US Biden took office?


We lead world, that's somehow good enough you. sentiment among fully vaccinated people continue wear masks, especially given new data. However stop maskholes lie say they’re vaccinated. might push remove mandates coming - mandate it’s necessary everyone’s safety? outside, wouldn’t concerned. inside it’s roll dice Thanks! I’m definitely going check out. Next week Brazilians Rio get lockdown imposed advancing holidays. happen school businesses resume? people can’t take anymore, friend’s wife going saunas, leaving kids barely legal childcare, 2021 seeing younger relatives friends getting really sick. Vaccine doses generally measured micrograms. take much millions doses. 

You also need test scale many situations ensure equipment process working properly. Explain 100 Washington fully vaccinated tested positive Well, case. people cant take one available COVID vaccines medical reasons, huge advantage mRNA technology. vanishingly contraindications I'm sure numbers recovered counted according Worldometers something like 7% French population currently covid. Imagine that, going outside every 12ish people see 1 probably sick. topic, borderline conspiracy. recently reported Minnesota well, however county Healthcare sites saying unable accommodate continuing concentrate Healthcare worker, seniors 65, targeted groups state Arizona exactly that. Eligibility expanded adults, later week, mask mandates voided executive order, one reasons cited ""vaccines available everyone"". Bunch morons. That's lose war. letting enemy get comfortable. Tonight went gathered bunch friends haven’t seen forever. almost feel guilty this. whole time there, back head thinking, get infected? shouldn’t here, isn’t ok. thinking much? Hopefully get back normal soon. Long Covid really scary, sounds like everything right still got burned. There's element luck one. actual shot felt like flu shot me, barely pinch. arm muscle definitely got sore lot faster though—almost immediately. Shaking helped though! Sorry harsh! it’s important I’ll leave harshness up.  see edit last link. asked source statement ""You get special antibody test pick antibodies produced response vaccine."" provided like 5. agreeing get certain type test pick vaccine antibodies. get sick? exposed 2 people covid months getting 2nd vaccine sick days. know anecdotal evidence I'm probably outlier man definitely sick hell, really eat days.  (disclaimer: expert way)

It's numbers game.

When exposed, get tiny fraction viruses on/in compared sick person has. sick person might billion virus particles in/on/around (all numbers invented illustrative purposes), contact, might end 0.001% viruses, immediately exposure acquired 10,000 virus particles. Viruses really dumb, virus particles sort end useless places ""die"", percentage end able get cells multiply, making something like thousands millions copies cell infect. point immune system notices starts killing them, *is* generally pretty effective killing viruses, there's many damn things takes (e.g. 2 weeks), enough viruses, show symptoms.

So let's take 2 scenarios Alice (who's sick) contacts Bob, Bob contacts Charlie little later later.

Scenario 1: Bob vaccinated. Viruses done rounds reproduction millions system. Charlie gets 0.001% Bob's viruses, means gets thousands, enough take hold get sick.

Scenario 2: Bob vaccinated. viruses can't get foothold Bob's body, contacts Charlie, still 10,000 virus particles originally got Alice. Charlie gets 0.01% those, is, single virus particle, overwhelmingly likely die without taking hold cells. Another cheap Chinese knockoff.

Their corruption incompetence turned minor outbreak global pandemic. corruption incompetence covering fact vaccine doesn’t work. 

The pandemic ending western world, hope ends everywhere. there’s part would enjoy karmic justice rages China years longer rest world moves without them. AK Alaska mean, one shot Pfizer appears roughly good J&amp;J. benchmark ""effective"" vaccine got data 50% one shot Pfizer certainly clears that. Sure, public recommendation needs people complete full course according tested approved. yes, second dose even better protection society. far ending pandemic, first doses going big impact already. Regardless facts set me, I'm dug I'll never change mind. I'm American to. anybody supporting move want ask one question:

How many people would received AZ vaccine would wager going going catch covid coming weeks spread somebody later dies covid? many people going catch variant that's shown dangerous young people get sent hospital get vaccine? chances things happening way fuck higher anyone age group getting blood clots AZ vaccine.

This seems like terrible fucking idea scary people okay this. drama mods ever get cleared up? Sure. relevant? posting states US keep repealing pandemic measures still pandemic despite US verge enough vax every adult, likely going able vax teens soon &amp; could open l w e r save people lot misery SERIOUS BULLSHIT EVERYBODY TOOK VACCINE 16 DIED WTF  Thank continuing post info! become regular 'go-to' source me! producing vaccine batches like supposed would caught much sooner. course... data doesn’t seem apply J&amp;J. part thinks realizes got bullied agreeing 3ft vs 6ft nonsense, trying overcompensate warnings. really thought ""impending doom"" coming, would allow kids pack tighter? makes sense. Yeah, I'm sure intended goals. PR fluff mesh well reality administration cut year-end estimates vaccine supply 100 million doses available 20 million available. reality Dec 11 Pfizer approved January 20, little 14 million Americans actually received first dose vaccine. reality administration promised January release doses national stockpile instead reserving second doses, later reveal national stockpile remaining used December. turned 20 Feb. events last year shown large percentage Americans spoiled ignorant children incapable understanding situation responding appropriately. ""amateur psychology"" always going part public health policy unfortunately. 

To put gently, serve anyone's interest create government sponsored ""apartheid"" system people without vaccination. reach herd immunity need stay course lowest-common-denominator approach. Australia businesses? anyone seen studies reliability Covid-Sniffing Dogs venues using? mean go Twitter see hysterical covid scolds like Eric fiegl-deng saying CDC wrong, Mike McHargue moron saying fully vaxxed people basically need keep quarantining. verified accounts many followers outsize platform media, they’re going continue pushing bullshit theories deadly variants coming vaxxed people spreading disease  Got J&amp;J today (27F)! I’m 7.5 hours aches/chills/fever set 2 hours ago. took Tylenol. Fever 101, aches moved arms hips/lower back, chills probably 5/10–not really physically shivering definitely cold yet feel heat radiating face. 

Anyone know earlier onset side effects means (most J&amp;J people I’ve seen said didn’t get side effects 10-12 hours post-shot) kind crapshoot? Everything company suspicious.  anybody know websites find specific vaccine? would prefer one done j &amp; j Yes, think also vaccinated people start wearing mask, unvaccinated people also wear, see people wearing mask. cause problems. people never intended get vaccine anyway fuck happened? thought twilight zone. leave days, come back it’s anti-vax, anti-mask, open-up-the-whole-goddam-world bullshit. Don’t quote think it’s still spreads (like someone sneezes shirt someone else touches shirt) virus can’t survive body due antibodies. maintain good hygiene, since immunity, longest actual virus survive hours. basically surface exposure worry point (which wear mask unvaccinated there’s issue) nowhere near enough people vaccinated, meant do? must looking different subreddits, information see always optimistic  wasn’t part 11 million delivery week believe though. that’ll impact Mid-April onward. Absolutely. Definitely points big weakness process design least. Thanks.

oh pete's sake, wonder I've never heard this. instead ""literally long-term side effects"" I'd say ""*practically* long-term side effects"" pretend understand supply chain processes sort thing...but would really trust something Iike 15 million doses anything - let alone important vaccine century - handful newbies?

wouldn't jurisdiction experienced execs something?

But proof flu vaccine want work nursing home cancer ward... need drivers license want drive public road instead private land. Go AZ! (I don’t live there, trying positive)  get people ""LIstEn eXPeRTs"" shoved throats year now. People flat refusing look data think themselves. Really? research long term effects COVID 19 young teens vs long term effects Pfizer vaccine?

Heck, even short term major issues young teens Covid-19? I’m anti vaccine, think people risk groups, like elderly, it’s pretty obvious take it. But, everyone else, think data sparse. know. take whatever ""they"" say giant grain salt right now. media constantly engaged doom porn CDC/Fauci constantly contradicting themselves. yeah people still saying kids magically immune covid19 unlike every contagious illness planet earth. Never mind studies plus personal experience anyone ever kid caught illness beloved child, niece, newphew, godchild... Certain likely two different things completely agree, guy No. vaccines currently planned fine schedule. Pretty true honest. 
Especially define love ""the wish see things flourish"", actively wishing probably hate. I'd love see something like US.

Personal accountability thing. mild case didn’t give single person

I don’t think that’s works really see issue. moment we're mask free, required self-isolate whatsoever, state one active case.

No, manufacturing two vaccines (Astrazeneca &amp; J&amp;J), cause mix ingredients. November December saying could spread it, saying ""we know, studied it, need research. going operate like know more."" People misunderstood mean vaccinated people could spread it. they've done research. That's really change tune. like answer lingering question. matter cleaning tanks starting over. enough say 'We'll careful next time.' need figure fix went wrong process, worse mistake could made again. Post source please. Good! always felt mask mandates tied direct availability. I’m gonna guess Arkansas probably never going reach herd immunity. encourage want get vaccinated, quickly...and refuse contribute herd immunity eventually. mean correct decision. They're extremely reactionary this. sure - case length lockdowns made sense. suppression/mitigation plan, gradual reopening keep reproductive rate 1/keep hospitals threatened would correct move. 

The true New York (although forgivable NYC events), California, Argentina, others. interpret vaccine that's 100% effective preventing deaths, estimate 1% infected people die, would hypothetically 150,000 deaths.

Similarly, legislature revokes state emergency, governor may simply reissue another one basis.""

Don't forget AOC well. Bucks mess. Like - mass vaccination sites? How? Bucks huge. Montgomery. planning one now. time get running everyone done. Fortunately mom lives NJ work there. seems pretty offensive me. data cited isn’t even true, non-vaccinated age groups increasing rate. Agreed. Question right thing? Different everyone suppose. Well, know absolute even true. examples people fully vaccinated caught covid. articles Reddit. search them. 

Unless talking particular vaccine, perhaps. guess meant flippant last statement was, don’t believe safe vaccinated, things ever end? course less death good, don’t reduce transmission way R0 protect can’t get vaccinated...... it’s right? Maybe I’m expressing well. less populated counties already odds never truly shut down. Inyo, highly doubt even Bishop truly listened restrictions large numbers, sure lot counties little enforcement since state officials much, local police. US currently administers 1.4-1.5 million first doses per day. 15 million would 10-12 days worth vaccination pace.

So, would cost, 10-12 days setback, assuming options Pfizer/Moderna. count extra 2nd dose two. “How Orwellian” says redditor waits patiently next Q Drop Ha! would mattered much doctors nurses got sick unable work, compounding disaster.

You seem miss point ran anyway. Almost immediately. made spread less important hospital spread. one mask, good hospital grocery store. enough.

Huh, almost like CDC telling people make/use cloth masks would made difference like said.

So, he's implying young people ""making significant sacrifices"" absolutely been. Here's comment left test 20 questions, get 100% right.  take test difficulty 200,000 questions (ignore test fatigue, superhuman). probably get right, pretty sure going get decent score.

That's is. Pfizer took test twenty questions got right. mean vaccine perfect? No. means vaccine pretty likely keep high percentage though. going drop 50% real world here. problem Arkansas, 13% fully vaccinated past weekend. folks, know, continue wear masks since everyone actually shot. Many places still 2 weeks appointments. received Moderna #1 yesterday almost immediately started feeling symptoms...fever, chills, headache, arm aching also mild cough. Almost 24 hours later headache gone fever mild cough still I've read cough side effect vaccine

Given started feeling cough immediately I'm worried may gotten couple days ago symptoms started showing time received vaccine. get tested? wait another night? 22 hours since shot Consistent theme past 12+ months honestly, vaccinations things trust medics corpsmen able do, handing Motrin telling people change socks . folks LOT shots. asked businesses done virtually answered hospitality industry. No, trial two dose vaccine 12-15 year olds check need adjustment Haven’t heard, UK/Astraveneca blame everything stage cases virtually eradicated

Uhhhh....what trackers looking at? 7 day average US 65,000 cases day trending up. vote become president governor? yep instead saying 99% say 100% can't get sued someone dies suffers side effect. Also happen say vaccine. area, dentists also giving shots. 

I wondering they'd attempt inject vaccine gums tell ""you'll feel little pinch"" what's astrazeneca failing deliver promised? :-/ what? That’s conspiracy theory. bunch countries quarantine periods enter. Bypassing showing you’ve vaccinated far idea. conspiracy theory would Bill Gates microchipping people moderna vaccine. Darwinism finest see. Still, seems like rhetorical flourish. seem reflect Cuomo's actual views; anything, he's reopening NY quickly.

Bottom line, we're still averaging thousand deaths *per day* US, soon reopen. realise you’re 1000x likely die Corona, right?

Darwinism action! Good move. Pre-banning people among laziest things Reddit mod do, also signals moderator ideologically motivated. something drama-heavy subreddits do, serious subreddits. recieved message one thst reinforces tribalistic mentaloty, ultimately harmful. far ethical hammer trolls needed. 

Especially emerging mod abuse drama. hopefully much lasting damage. Especially since mod question decided see reason end. understanding vaccines use right virus generate cells varying degrees though. involvement cells minimal? 

One things think that's interesting reading exchange person they're explicitly focused immune system failures paints entire conversation around topic. example bring cells help clear infection someone gets infected otherwise healthy immune system. person comes says ""actually find reinfected individuals severe responses trend toward severe reinfection. like...yeah I'm sure someone severe case covid likely worse immune system someone healthy immune response asymptomatic case. got Pfizer Vaccine today New Mexico I'm 24 BTW thought going wait another month two,

Can't wait turn teenage mutant ninja turtle also pretty interesting everyone talking Texas/FL, NY averaging like 8k daily cases since JANUARY China reminder party responsible Emergent BioSolutions, slimy company ability determine federal emergency medical reserve's procurement years, causing far over-purchase anthrax vaccines instead buying useful supplies like masks ventilators. found *lot* deep truths pandemic stuck inside day live state legalized cannabis. vaccine government want get.

I’m asking, I’m appealing young people curtail social activity. appeal blow rest us. blow parents neighbors others working really really hard making significant sacrifices, get good outcomes everybody.

Doesn't seem offensive me. Take test 20 questions, get 100% right.

Now take test difficulty 200,000 questions (ignore test fatigue, superhuman). probably get right, pretty sure going get decent score. affect Johnson &amp; Johnson doses currently delivered used nationwide. doses produced Netherlands

At least EU suckers keep handing guys vaccines, enjoy! JnJ novel vaccine well. viral vector. fact works similar way mRNA vaccines, except complicated delivery mechanism (using virus deliver genetic payload rather cutting middle man using lipid-encased mRNA sneak past cell membrane). 

Novavax first truly traditional vaccine protein sub-unit. fancy use cells make protein (which helps drive stronger immune response). dump protein directly bloodstream. 

But hey, people think JnJ ""traditional"" somehow safer means, let's keep rumor flowing. That’s statistically unlikely It’s 6 days worth shots given current rate. Absolutely!! cool.

American states restrictions probably history come summer Well first I've heard this, I've graduated BA one university another. two siblings recently graduated different ones - vaccine checks either. sure uni went lol. Wow that's true!! think I'll delete someone post updated numbers don’t think force vaccine people don’t need small frail population don’t think numbers back up. many people can’t get vaccine frail? would bet it’s negligible amount. amount could save entire small countries goddammit, able stand nutjobs talking permanent government takeover right. someone think otherwise? Honestly power them. need shots arms matter what. people travel get vaccine they're distributed optimally, better shots sitting freezers can't save lives. countries open without forced Vaccination much ethical vaccine passport?

Seems like it. friend likely dealing anxiety social activities year isolation. real issue lot people following guidelines faithfully. work anxiety return level social activity, may take bit everyone social before. 

If close relationship, consider asking they’re dealing this. Let know there’s nothing wrong they’re alone- consequence many us experienced. patient consider suggesting low key activities help ease back around others. Examples- hanging place 1 hour (this assumes fully vaccinated.) Ask think might good activity. 

We trajectory ‘stay safe, protect others’ long seems plain weird might dangerous soon/now. going need lot figure feel safe again. Recognizing stuff actually help us understand feelings we’re experiencing don’t misinterpret actual danger. fully underestimate many people arent interested begin species could much better.. there's massive dumb, religious, scared group people holding everyone else back.

It reminds Jim Jefferies riff religion : didn’t carry risk allowing new strains mutate, would inclined agree. But, does, might ruin everything. Maybe bad, could jumping gun room together. 6 feet vs 3 feet theater. keeping kids school harms them, too. winning. Far it. 
How many people refuse vax? incidentally people mask up. Perfect population virus mutate. press consortium shows even higher number, 3950   take back previous reticence actually wear mask forever avoid fucking shit, mean actual fuck. File ""no shit"".  flu mists several times, suck. penetrate me, doc. Moderna appointment 4/8, I'm 24-year-old male Indiana preexisting conditions. chance appointment gets canceled someone urgent group get it, eligibility requirements raised? I'm sure much affects vaccine rollout. Blue arrows quell cognitive dissonance. They're biotech. That's really weird. didn’t say anything making mandatory. 

You asked teens would need get vaccine, gave reasons would useful/helpful. Ok J&amp;J appointment next weekend that's kinda shot?

The absolute timing. I'm torn one. I'm older person serious underlying condition masks place least able get groceries, tired them. continue wear mask public long necessary.  think it, directly caused death cause deaths hundreds thousands people. Depends amount cases have. it’s still high (due ppl refusing get vaccinated large portion population unable get vaccinated whatever reason new variant coming that’s vaccine resistant) need keep restrictions till case load goes down.

If it’s low (I.e. isolated pockets) remove restrictions accordingly. Masks last restrictions go imo. “Follow science! CDC knows do!”

“Oh wait, said something good? Burn - she’s obviously wrong!” plenty people risk can't vaccinated, usually they're frail.  probably killed hope herd immunity 4th July, always kind longshot though else supposed go? homeless shelter?

Florida mandated stay hospital - per governor, confident could increase hospital capacity would rather deal potential issue COVID positive patients infecting everyone nursing home. US still likely getting mRNA vaccine get anytime next two months. J&amp;J production got majorly delayed. I'm also getting moderna. honestly vaccine read much online went wrong way. think realistically again, I'm looking forward getting hopefully getting back normal soon! J&amp;J really Kevin Malone chilli’d 15 million doses Baltimore, didn’t they... July 15th Dont know wouldn’t. Although state’s going drag political reasons. Pfizer repeatedly moved goals rather moved backward like J+J. Recency bias favors Pfizer Probably enough really matter. worth time/energy Yep. they're use unless they're universal. Someone held responsible this. even utter word Taiwan. Meh, chuckled doubt actually 100% effective starts distributed general public, trial, none people got actual vaccine got COVID-19, 18 people received placebo did. You’ll probably noticeable sore arm tomorrow morning. mid afternoon little bit better. Friday back normal :). I’m second night felt little nausea tiredness also could I’m tired! people suffer though, we're mercy country's politicians economic situation. I’ve seen transparent masks, I’m guessing fog super bad... fake carts add layer protection well virus die either way 5% people vaccinated still catch/spread virus.

But 100 million? war. European companies contracted make vaccine failed deliver promises. Living children, trade masks game, lick shopping cart handles, crawl floor may increase COVID spread? Sames. time.....get shot move on? I've heard echoed many people. hope go back Objectively lockdown large percentage population following rules, removing rules would result higher chances virus spread people resume normal life begin interacting people more. Simple math: people lockdown pandemic means people situations may potentially contract virus.

Look happened florida, state notorious rules restrictions vast majority people: 3 million fully vaccinated Viruses exist. Covid wither away. shouldn’t able take risk?
Why vaccine touted thing people this, especially severe ger healthier people?
if means boosting immune system, reducing severity, ok? 
The whole idea get would otherwise hospitalized risk category. August, bad getting shot mean people go back licking doorknobs

Now kink shaming. Mass vaccinations middle pandemic create variants survive. reason used give people flu shots October, way flu season. definitely frustrating. try get angry systems allowed crackpot ideas flourish though. Motivates things like actually vote even thing ballot school board. I'd ball unproductive rage otherwise! 

Ha! appreciate that, promise, want sealed glorified tin someone failing digestive system time period much less time it'd take get Mars! Media UK North America can't relate Vietnam proxy validate journalists' favoured domestic politicians. *Yes*, true. Though going mention part, essentially need intentionally, people less knowledge biology us might take fact think vaccine **might** accidentally modify DNA, even though that's works. I'm confused - 17k tests high number tests? can't right, it? I'm NY we're like 250k per day. I'm assuming I'm reading something wrong here. know Wisconsin less people many less people. term used thousand people already. He’s genius. think probably TheFatJeeush Instagram coined months ago. Fuck yeah! totally see raw dogging smoggy California air!! Anecdotal, since we're talking Alabama I'll shoot. Bucc-Ees Baldwin County, AL Saturday place fucking free all. I'm quite familiar citizens Baldwin County expecting whole lot still alarming place like seen anything close year.

Matter fact, think last time madhouse Bucc-Ees little year ago February 2020, right pandemic I’m interested it’s also complicated data coming Israel shows vaccinated people aren’t catching SA variant higher rates unvaccinated people. lucky here. sheltered worst comes viral economic pandemic.

You're lucky value safety freedom. Many, people terms risk infection virus. can't tell people they're prisoners year two like ""oh people prisoners, 15% people died year normal!"". We've given 1% lives order extend average life like month. I've got condition sometimes push washing hands they're bleeding, whenever read people getting sick washing hands blows away. cannot imagine okay feeling, explanation makes sense feeling disgust filth exist them. Yes course. one cares women’s healthcare; show. look r/twoxchromosomes see it’s like get sick you’re woman. Google chainsaw originally invent. According healthcare industry, women nothing hysterical human incubators don’t get sick can’t feel pain.

Source: woman think overthinking it. 

A, two people covid plane infect people one, catching one spare people getting sick.

B, planes flown 1 infected person them. majority planes flown 0 infected people, even. stopping 70% 1-infected-on-the-plane scenarios already great. 

In Hong Kong live, everyone gets plane gets tested airport held result comes back. There's quite flights coming day(but nothing like course) nab handful cases per day.

The big crux people infected test negative virus inoculated yet. people testing positive day 19(!!!) mandatory arrival quarantine(locked 21 days baby).

If aim zero covid, test get way. things won't, still use them, cos magical perfect options... 100% effectiveness defined, proven? imagine could scientifically prove control group intentionally infect virus? then, virus? original virus seems disappeared already? whole family, feels good made without single case. heart goes lucky. Safe relative term. mean highest, scientifically validated protection two weeks second dose Moderna Pfizer. Although “safe” could realistically mean little two weeks first dose. case Moderna, reach 80% efficacy symptomatic infection point, likely severe cases close nil. use RNA modify DNA viruses- check HIV works example. posted something similar six months ago regarding wearing mask flu season, downvoted.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thank that. understand people, especially drunk ones hahaha 😅 Europe US isn’t exporting yet. pass though? around someone covid vaccinated, virus die contact you? I'm bad science lol Yemen can't catch break zeneca production issues , isn’t reason delayed deliveries. top EU usual EU turned whole vaccine take farce , didn’t make decisions vaccine approval timely manner , ordered vaccines late, told populations wasn’t worth having, propagated blood clot myth. supplies ramp you’ll sit moan Zeneca don’t want that.

 really prove bully spoiled child eu leadership they’ll ban exports countries, strangely seem countries ties uk well threats stop exports Uk.

Stop moanining realise issue lies leadership, company. think “treat everyone equally” whether they’re vaccinated not, right? since well known vaccines make people less contagious less susceptible severe symptoms, treating everyone equally different lying? many frontline healthcare workers January March got Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine? Thankful reddit doctors letting us know director CDC wrong 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 know damage keeping isolated peers Yup. Stronger immune response expected younger people, leading higher level effectiveness vaccines. 

My SIL told worry effects second Pfizer; didn’t problem. 

I actually glad wake day shot feel like I’d beaten stick. 

I wanted evidence immune system kicking in, age 70. Kids still catch spread gran; they're worse infection reservoir bats. world fun new mutants manage, virus moved goalposts respond miss goal.

Give kids protection bolsters protection across society. contact doctor advise you. got opportunity get Pfizer refused curevac phase 3 studies, hope worth it. Creating legally distinctively first second class citizens harmful, especially cannot get vaccine yet.

They show proof vaccine university vaccines actually get fda approved, emergency use ones one even find appointment for. try tackle dangerous one?

Who say dangerous one? killed 10's millions mink dangerous strain yet came mink humans.

There roughly 8 billion humans roughly 130 billion mammals.

Good luck. liberal anti-vaxxers conservative anti-vaxxers. form distrusting corporations/big pharma/etc. preferring ""natural"" solutions. 

Although probably true Covid anti-vaxxers. can't imagine backlash Pfizer teens get sick vaccinated. They're claiming vaccine ""100 percent effective preventing illness teenagers ages 12 15."" Bro 90% us hate wearing masks. protect others. yeah inconvenience wearing piece cloth face much cross bear helping prevent deaths yeah, don’t really care others.

I agree though cases go start removing restrictions. sHoTs MAsKs kind simplistic Neanderthal thinking got us shit first place. Rumour Matt Gaetz also 100% young teens. Altho totally ineffective general. I’m enrolled university right lol. guarantee never sent medical record mine.  God, people insufferable. forget that, UK trial, Novavax's vaccine staggering 96% effective ancestral Covid variants (efficacy UK variant still hugely impressive 86%). That's even better mRNA vaccines. NJ Avoid reposting information. effect them, anything else there. Kids higher chance dying school bus ride school Covid. 10 states didn’t even child mortality. zero reason keep masks past June everyone get vaccine. want keep “protecting” kids whatever reason, go ahead. obvious non science response. Many vaccines sterilizing Secret hidden final villain  know Texas going push deaths 1k ever added worldometer. Still could less last wednesday though Technically Belgian company developed vaccine. business NJ live Bucks. 38 years old haven’t even gotten email stating maybe I’ll able get vaccinated August. def sucks. Thanks write-up! realise using Bayesian stats (hadn't seen paper) - Bayesian bit rusty - genuinely appreciate since wondering 77% came from.

FYI frequentist still get confidence interval that's \[100,100\] - ""normal"" method CIs. example Clopper-Pearson method I'd use scenario would generate confidence interval 99.8% - 100%. Bit detail Signs point vaccinated people spreading either, great news. local infection rate down, restrictions safely lifted. Every university does, didn’t go university.  be. Got (Moderna) first shot yesterday. looking card lady gave even notice gave shot. Later last night arm got sore (was sore 24 hours) clearly get it, shots go least painful shot I've everhad.... point even notice I'd received it. Right, posting whatever opinions decided reality.

Never stop redditing. Sounds like moving goalposts me!  love it. wasn’t. university never asked vaccinations had.  United filling seats February, sooner. also drink let unmask basically long want. 😄😄😄 That's call justifying infection reservoir fine place mutations. No. don’t care either. think right long fight. rest nonsense. states set date adults yet? know Biden said 90% adults eligible soon I'm wondering who's excluded. country (the US). There’s segment population chosen thinking instead let controlled Facebook’s user engagement algorithms. Misinformation highly profitable here, people’s lives damned. unlike others? One hell question man pandemic shown majority leaders America countries bad job.

A strong leader would set good example citizens follow, instead basically wild west many places. cities resorting lockdowns, way actually get anything done many people bare minimum. shitty alternative unmitigated virus spread hospitals can't handle influx patients. Maybe pregnant something. Hormones crazy. I'd get got penicillin. think ban penicillin shifting goalposts normally work you?

Also yes, Covid hurts kids, you’d understand basic critical thinking skills.  

Like right now, moment could spend less 30 seconds alleviate bit ignorance dense fucking brick call head. 

Try it, it’s addictive!  Hell first hit free, ya go. 

Now go “wELl kNeW MeAnt” limp dick response try right internet? order people get back normal life things enjoy, get vaccine don’t want. Sounds lot like forcing me. That's assuming restrictions ever enforced first place whether they're still enforced. I've seen multiple posts Texans saying nothing changed, businesses enforcing mask mandate restrictions lifted still are. I've also read articles talking event cancellations coming restrictions lifted.

I driving part Tennessee weekend. stopped gas station nobody except wearing mask. asked (unmasked) employee register whether mask mandate, said store enforce it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* get Biden administration said vaccine passport, entirely driven private industry local governments (city level) Florida. bad thing? big government picture. Avoid reposting information. Great, responded part post past Edit:

Do care respond first part, I'm refuting explanation happening? honestly don’t care long every dose administered.  Zika Virus virus happened impacted fertility. Women gave birth babies mutated heads. worry, conscience always clean. Yeah mean pretty much since vaccinations announced intelligent people could’ve guessed this. perfect example gap medical experts able say something scientific certainty realistically likely happen. There’s always chance vaccinated person spread virus, chance minimal need worry practice. I’m sure get downvoted oblivion lockdown enthusiasts, that’s operate aspects life That's science you: matter sure we're right, still prove it. J&amp;j still testing 2 shot Mobbed up? He’s definitely spineless moron I’m sure he’s mobbed Avoid reposting information. Hospitalization death main concern.
Have another downvote. “forced get vaccine” go college? personally don’t care NJ NY residents come PA shots. merely providing explanation eastern PA doesn’t much capacity rest state. Delaware River shouldn’t determine get vaccinated. Yeah hard gauge, way see look relatively.

If city struggling elevated coronavirus spread already fairly strict rules place, i'd expect numbers get even worse everyone allowed everything zero restrictions. people interacting public chances virus spread would much higher. 

So things bad there's chance they'd get worse eased restrictions, obvious choice stay course case count begins get lower.

Thank mask study, i'll try sending fear he's already fallen rabbithole ""the cdc cannot trusted"". trial conducted US countries well? punishment getting vaccine. People shouldnt coerced getting it. don’t want too, that’s fine. point everyone around they’ll get won’t matter anyways. kids killing us. must know something! so? different bodies life experiences. uncomfortable comfortable you. could find two people body two us two completely different opinions. 

I crawling skin flight Portland Boston. get walk aisle several times able sit without feeling like literally strapped chair. 

Just opinions experiences different mean invalid. means different. 

I'm glad able comfortable. envious beyond words comfortable seats. big deal all.

It happened one person. Anything happens one person basically ignored given we're administering stuff millions.

There direct evidence rash caused vaccine. eliminated causes concluded vaccine reaction. really know that. could happened.

The rash manageable guy fine now. know treat rashes, COVID-19 harder. There's famous celeb UK, Pfizer 1 month ago COVID (and feeling rough, sleeping lot etc. like asymptomatic. whole family it.)

Moreover, lady Israel studies died COVID second Pfizer shot. hope see vaccine take severe disease long term/perma damage many cases possible saying noone gets sick spreads vaccinated kind news antivaxxers run disprove, epitome cuntholery CDC. got first Pfizer dose nearest Krispy Kreme 45 mins away :(. 

Maybe treat second dose I'll make drive! starting think I’d see news year would blew mind. We’re rounding third base now. clear, registration say anything more. kids want know ho registered. 

So, Constitution Bill Rights specify Sex Offender registration? doesn’t. It’s ruled double jeopardy ruling. one punished crime twice. First convicted conviction, register. That’s punished twice crime. cities make go door door telling immediate neighbors like California. 

Registration public safety issue ruling context conjunction double jeopardy. Constitution state sex offender register. Justices ruled stated public safety rules sex offenders rights. brought front Supreme Court, Constitutionality. 

The point wisdom Wisconsin’s Supreme Court striking mask mandate. clear didn’t side wisdom like sex offender registration laws, written individual states, Feds. Wisdom dictates public’s safety importance. wisdom court protecting people? protect children adults matter offenders, can’t lives protected? That’s point I’m making. again, Republicans/conservatives tendency lean towards protecting offenders fucking victims hence gun rights arguments Gaetz voted sex offender law would affect get convicted. trust conservative judges protecting public ever. EU committed act war UK... Hey - I’m one those. know healthcare workers (2) vaccinated December got recently. Super mild, tested positive. means you’re vaccinated get give it. yeah, think means masks distancing population cleared. mean risk isn’t person infected. It’s everyone else too. know ongoing studies people get vaccine, also take biologics (ie: Humira, Remicaid, Cosentyx, etc)? And, so, preliminary data come studies? Asking friend passed 2 2nd Pfizer vaccine... masking social distances? We're talking Alabama... got AZ stock people skeptical vaccinating even cause eyeballs fall out, skin fall off. Terrifying stuff. Ah, yeah, I'm right subreddit loves anything doom gloom. Unnecessary chances what? people still right choose Rimming hobby, also line work. probably best example anecdotes never trump statistics data analysis. Regardless isn’t going encourage people continue wearing masks vaccine. doesn’t matter. anyone know cdc guidelines new data? exciting! declaration human rights include right exposed respiratory virus. Unless vaccine-resistant variant happens everyone vaccinated. Nothing prevents virus mutating manner.  Ok. Thank link. 

I focused much Johnson &amp; Johnson. Clearly, I'm wrong. article right three vaccines' trial runs 100% effective death. “Now rewrite guidelines say vaccinated people around unvaccinated people even without masks distancing,” said Ghandi. 

Wow, pre-2020 knowledge vaccines real along! RIP Bringing younger supposedly better trained people. People working 20+ years didn’t date schooling not.

In case, 100% would always upper end confidence interval, regardless whether confidence used 90%, 95%, 100% (or reasonable choice).

So really interpreted one-sided confidence interval, confidence 97.5% (I would still consider fine refer ""95%"" confidence interval, since comparable two-sided 95% confidence intervals generated anything sample percentage 0% 100%) 1.6% caught reported symptoms. testing asymptomatic infection all. Ahem, us hillbilly counties consistently (and continue have) lower per capita case counts SEPA cityslicker counties. Yes, probably due low density rather good behavior, think theory vaccines distributed holds water. least 9 months. I'll honest, first time confirmed testing due early was. I'm LA likely caught California variant second time around Christmas 2020, especially considering distancing stricter time. Honestly would get tested position. Worst thing happens wasted time get negative test. Yeah, really. 5'5"" cramped? Give break. automatically get fired chance get vaccine declined beforehand. Young adults much likely see 100% protection end spectrum.

Do mean protection disease infection? studies pulling assumption from? done? Anyone know Canada’s doses supposed arrive end April? US factories European? Yup especially since one-dose vaccine. loss would enough cover half Canada's adult population, 1/4 South Africa, 100% Netherlands, etc. CDC considers someone received JnJ fully vaccinated 2 weeks shot. Would good see peer reviewed study demonstrating causes blood clots, since onus upon party making claim provide proof. subreddit continue rag AZ this? Logic would suggest this. most, all, vaccines work. successful rollout countries ie UK possible EU exists. Yeah, want get caveats strict percentage, agree say letting someone stadium vaccinated forcing get vaccinated. would production mixup got vaccine affect opinion past decision?

And news articles say Pfizer effective J&amp;J. comparison. court's ""opinion article"" put it, legally binding judgment. law Wisconsin. That's equivalent 30 million Pfizer/Moderna jeeez. Likely enough prevent 20,000 deaths... Fuck indeed. likely die car crash travelling vaccination centre. Good news caught it.. bad news caught 15million. Wow massive waste set back much. Emergent ones screwed up. J&amp;J weathered worse PR nightmare. anything showed system worked, caught error nobody got hurt. good, gimme plz Canada delaying 2nd dose 4 months enough good hear. similar vein: I'm rather impressed Novavax - company previously bought zero vaccines market, close financial ruin late 2019 RSV vaccine failed phase 3 trials - able create protein subunit vaccine significantly immunogenic antigen Sanofi, one biggest drugmakers planet, able tried using technology (the one redo phase 1/2 trials result). check vaccine worked? 😂 supposed protection 2 weeks first dose, full impact achieved 4 weeks first dose. One HUGE mistake people make getting vaccinated immediately relax assumption immunity kicks immediately. That's leads people risky behavior frequent infection. gotta wait least month feel well protected. yeah haha, spoke soon. arm feel sore, much. hoping stays way! take fewer patients prove safety vs efficacy? statistical significance variations injected control groups calculated either variable? what? What's happened happened. Production mistakes happen future. grateful three approved vaccines point, number way. British media completely useless comes Europe. often unrealistically positive like guardian, mind numbingly deceitful (tabloids, telegraph).
If truly want informed Europe, pay attention British media, exception FT least trying objective. Efficacy rates everything. Every vaccine thus far virtually 100% effective hospitalization death. That's even mention fact J&amp;J's trial conducted worst COVID spike, likely hurting raw efficacy percentage comparison others conducted congrats getting shot! Let's hope everyone soon enough. countries needed get zero like New Zealand, Taiwan, Australia, Hong Kong parts Canada.

New Zealand Australia 0. doubts countries listed too. data outdated? takes day numbers change. Leave still can, Stockholm’s syndrome lol Yea thats dog Ahh you’re comparing us Depending are, may time switch. least look see. Just, kind cancel first appointment get different one. even possible I'm getting one dose Pfizer. lot studies say one dose enough good protection. (I may get second eventually, 21 days first.) I'm curious see many anti-vaxxers keep silly beliefs get covid vaccinations stop sick keep getting spreading family many kill admit truth convert reality? Also point sick covid LONG vaccinated warrant excuse miss life force everyone get shot shunned? Oh, also special kind stupid. draw blanket conclusions 1 2 posts think proof vaccination may required international travel US countries finally open. pretty slim majority. Right like 51% Pfizer, 47% Moderna. Absolutely. Preach it. That's also true. Though always thought mask thing weird. Masks used prevent transmission potentially epidemic viruses century recently decade ago, countries much recently that. seemed counterintuitive discourage widespread mask use. understand concern people changing behaviour wearing mask could helped education clear guidelines. still know mask use would restrict spread. know limited effects would be. limited, right, cloth masks still impact spread.

It's live study pandemic behaviour find interesting too. behaviour huge impact disease spread always big part epidemics pandemics.  haven’t heard Vietnam? amazingly low infection rates Covid 19. fantastic! antibodies test done? two weeks, maybe wait one week sure? hope US start exporting vaccines soon. Vaccinating everyone US great, leaving half world short vaccines gives virus lot room mutate. Yay data!

keep datum safe! March 2022. Aren’t already that? I’m nurse pretty much everyone work vacationing going restaurants since vaccinated. They’re living differently non vaccinated friends family USA representative democracy... Exactly. small sample size still bother test asymptomatic carriers. need click bait headlines, need know well vaccines prevent infection.

They're going wrong direction here. need larger studies suffient numbers test different dosage schedules quantities, smaller studies can't even give statistically significant data single metric. No, vacccines touted repeatedly stopping death. won't. You’re right change dosing would require re-do trials. possible formal approval, means guaranteed. EUA simply isn’t thing approval. Emergent fired bunch employees forever brought bunch inexperienced people couple months ago I'm Ft. Wayne love city much, hate Indy. lol gonna upset lot redditors much damage think J&amp;J news public trust vaccine?

All I’ll say it’s shocking. LOL! Thank you.. Right got shot watched video Brazilian doctor pretending give vaccine somebody. got antsy.  Yeah, we're going see eye eye this. even agree facts seem think okay, even good outcome. That's case. knows. Really don’t think there’s way knowing right now. haven’t done chief.

[Coronavirus mutated immunocompromised patient plasma therapy: case Infected Covid-19 Patients: Potential Source New Variants May Arise People Compromised Immune Systems  I'm Canadian expat currently living Vietnam absolutely confirm Vietnam done great job controlling virus. restrictions. mask mandate. small number people continue wear masks crowded situations like buses. people stopped wearing masks (except riding motorbikes dust covid). Day day life resumed go café gym restrictions masks.  
Last week went crowded football stadium watch match. half fans wore masks, Vietnamese friend nobody cared didn't.

We started vaccinating well Astrazenaca.  


Life good Vietnam. seeing rapid pace vaccinations America fills hope. Canada, country, also increasing rate vaccinations. almost got it, “more doses sites available streamlined” - large part steps Biden took Trump refused do! one thinks still good idea vaccinated people wear masks social distance around unvaccinated people.

If (in US), vaccinated person's risk contracting covid-19 tenth risk unvaccinated person's, *and* daily new case rate right ten times year ago, implies vaccinated person today likely general risk catching covid unvaccinated person year ago... everyone started wearing masks social distancing.

So social distancing wearing mask last year unvaccinated, still things right even fully vaccinated. (I grant I'm including hand waving argument likelihood get covid-19 vaccinated, likely milder case vaccinated.)

So I'll looking daily case rates plummet I'll acting like summer 2019 again. It’s cheaper fly first class get two extra seats. rapid tests aren’t accurate. get PCR test reschedule vaccination sure hope they're paying him, alternative much depressing. Vaccine resistant. Yuck. Ya shit. little evidence present study support suggestions children may infectious adults got text mass vaccination program, I'm supposed get text tomorrow get vaccination scheduled. Isn’t sort “no shit statement”? mean, getting sick point vaccine, right? typically sick, one won’t carry, spread virus, right? would quite bit surprising see opposite headline. How's everybody doing? study literally five children. warm desert. factor. Still good news.  enough people vaccinated globally

That never happen underdeveloped regions world. Wow, comparing Bidens days Trumps first few? country world did, Biden done doses sites available streamlined. Compare US rest world time, good better Can't play god... Yes - evolving conversation supported new knowledge. 

I still somewhat sold original igg antibody tests vaccine vs natural. fact clinical studies already covid infected could use test show increase igg titers.

I reading overnight.

“""Remember: immune response antibodies. cell response parts immune system,"" Priest said.” right goes back original point around igg Thank goodness! I've it. big deal. I'm healthy. sick weak die strong survive. way nature intended.  Somerset, PA, CVS vaccine availability day today. filled (no idea availability first showed, open entire day now). Washington, PA, regularly appointments available CVS well.

Go get shot. Well death actually. victim Mexican cuisine. Except 4 variations, keep getting shots dummies. FYI, one companies sold cancerous products decade's... mean Covid spreads schools all? Say what?!? /s CDC officially informs us 3 feet distancing, masks, standard measures enough keep schools safe, based scientific evidence. better reasoning overturns CDC's guidance?

An important distinction disease, flu, preventive techniques (except hand washing ""recommendations"") never seriously considered. Fear-mongering nonsense. Yay Arizona don’t say? Yes Dandan0005 President! unknown long-term effects seemingly drive kill yourself? amen. worked anti-vaxxer last job. also total germaphobe. Let get it. Hope people responsible get jailed never see sunlight again. Uh oh getting one vaccine safe 4 variations? concern son really dont know long term impacts. strange disease. Potentially infecting nearly every organ including brain.

Personally, mom sent chickenpox party. know meant risk shingles get old. shingles (missed booster), suffered appears permanent nerve damage constant pain. shitty way live last years.

Even low chance us finding significant long term impacts childhood covid, weird many willing write risk off.

(34F) j&amp;j 10:30am today, far side effects! It’s almost 12 hours mildly sore arm. shot pinch little expected, kind caught guard. I’m hoping make night side effects! Fingers crossed! viral particles enter respiratory system would expect vaccinated, antibodies particles. virus needs enter cells produce viral particles makes person able spread virus. Antibodies attack virus prevent entering cells therefore able replicate. Hope helps! Wow 3 digit hospitalization one common viruses. That’s mind blowing. Obviously lockdowns played role wonder normal year masks alone slow spread much. Mate I'm 16 I'm mistaken still alive vaccinated  new normal IIRC, it’s can’t get vaccine, immune system won’t react virus vaccinated not. 

But also take medicines help stop infection immune system sucks Also, there’s new evidence variants created immunocompromised people virus much longer time multiple mutations singular person.

I highly doubt this. That’s like saying two sets dna I’m old. got source this?  honest, public told N95 masks offer best protection would riots strip shelves clean, left absolutely none health care professionals. 

Fauci scientist, one works government, usually messed-up stew genuine concern public health, political self-preservation, bureaucratic sludge - forget necessary pandering corporate special interests looney extremist voter blocs. that's good day - sometimes SNAFU made even worse mentally unstable idiot inhabiting highest office.

It's realistic apply purity test every statement Fauci makes. IMO given circumstances he's done pretty good job. feels way hit 100M 19 days ago (3/12). comparison, hit 50M 27 days (2/13) took 61 days first 50M (12/14).

At rate growth, would hit 200M 4/13. might little overly optimistic, would expect someday week. 250M likely happen first week May. Well record I'm talking people wish continue measures mass vaccination Krispy Kreme offers free donut vaccination card every day end year US getting started. 22% healthcare workers, government workers, elderly part. States lowering age receive vaccine time passes statistic increase dramatically well They've completely fucked Montgomery Birmingham done both.

There's terrible people everywhere live know plenty people done anything stupid know done everything wrong. also know public places I've like stores, doctors offices, etc. done decent job, go county north people want. can't write entire state measures taken. Lmao posts r/genzedong r/Russia Generally, comes infectious diseases, start incubation period. symptoms start, incubation period symptomatic infection. symptomatic infection begins, towards end incubation period, start become contagious actively shed virus, beginning communicability period, spread disease. period begins start showing symptoms, agent replicated infected enough cells.

If vaccinated, virus able replicate incubation period, reach stage actively shed virus spread it. least, replicates tiny bit cause enough infect someone, greatly reduces chances (like reduced viral load).

It's possible someone could breath covid clothing, go give unvaccinated person hug gets dispersed way, I'd imagine that's pretty rare.

So eli5, virus needs replicate inside body infect person get shedded. person vaccinated, virus can't replicate can't spread person person.

*not doctor* Um... four kids eldest eligible vaccine right birthday MONTHS now. would kind like protect anti-vax crowd. little cousins nieces nephews too. Also people cannot take vaccine health reasons allergy? remember required show proof vaccination moved UK live 3 years upon return US. get special vaccination travel agents say needed any. one asked visited France either. Granted late 90s early 2000 maybe that's changed. need vaccine passport participate regular activities. Well 100,000 Americans died final weeks last administration, even though two vaccines available plenty time coordinate states rapidly get people's arms. instead tripling getting shots arms, general preoccupation contest overturn election results point stoking insurrection Congress.

But yes, 14 million people dosed 41 days absolutely good enough me, especially since current administration succeeded dosing 5-6 times many people amount time. means, keep standards low. let’s say 1 100,000 people get astrezenca. would mean 1,000/100,000,000 people forth.

Yeah, entire year, they're going totally able give two? “Our data CDC today suggests vaccinated people don’t carry virus, don’t get sick it’s clinical trials, it’s also real world data,” said Walensky.

That's words CDC director. Again, maybe there's nuance get, find misleading. Canada’s 😂? back envelop comparison unvaccinated population...

WA currently 12 new cases / 100k per day, that’s 120 new cases per day per million, 7200 comparable 2 month period. 102 vs 7200 huge difference (and 98.5% efficacy rate, similar CDC data). Ontario Greece. Yea Israel basically done. given vaccine shots population means least half fully vaccinated shows greatly numbers. 

Germany barley given vaccines deaths reduced new low even tho cases surging again. 

If living Brazil country part EU outside Germany preety good. Maybe could use super secret 29m vaccines amazingly found Italy? Oh wait... funny. know think arguing original article says, actually supporting it.

People need stop acting like recent. 50 years ago. 

You forced space small rich. Basic comfort unrealistic expectation. seats tight cramped lot people would able afford air travel like today. Greyhound car.

Again, FIFTY YEARS AGO. Furthermore, they've making seats narrower legroom smaller every years despite fares accessible lower-income people. make fares cheaper got rid able choose seat, added another fee. find sliver worth bearable! It’s also airlines stopped going bankrupt business like past! 

They stop going bankrupt. throwing easily disproven lies? asked bailouts days COVID crisis despite actually needing them. historically always lost money recently....which also coincides cheaper frills airfares include seat nothing else.

I would like see actual proof this. Show evidence airlines always lost money cheap seat-only tickets became available. 

I look forward never addressing question. happened number people traveling United States world wide? They’ve increased highest levels ever. Air travel never accessible everyone worldwide currently is....

Post hoc ergo propter hoc valid argument. gave passengers (customers) wanted everyone could afford.

No, didn't. gave people expensive possible fare people would say ""this worth price"". making “absurd” assumption meant lie flat seats.......premiums seats you’d consider standard size seats.... pay extra them.

You said first class. First class seats lie flat. 

I aware pay extra them. keep repeating obvious shit though new information? Oh, right, trying make sound uninformed stupid.

Jackass. 

Delta offers non-stop flight currently live family lives, I've primarily flown Delta past 5 years. 40% steerage, 40% steerage tiny smidge extra leg room, 10% business class.

The steerage slightly leg room bearable leg room still narrow. 

Business class phenomenal far past I'd like see coach. 

Other Delta fly Jet Blue whenever possible, primarily slightly legroom. 

Other whoever cheapest fewest layovers. 

I never flown Spirit budget airlines. right. Airlines charge every little thing gives customer choice want pay don’t.....

Bull shit. gives opportunity charge EXTRA fees things already paying for. drop prices decided charge extra picking seats. made air travel cheaper accessible ever before. Airlines wouldn’t eat cost amenities would include seat prices everyone would pay things. Even used/wanted/enjoyed not.

Stop lying. 

The thing made air travel cheaper efficient aircraft shoving seats planes. Charging people LUXURY spending $60 ensure seated next child drove cost airfare. impossibility cost airfare declining decades fee introduced. 

If lying, every airline would charge carry-on personal item.

If lying, every airline would actually try optimize boarding de-boarding.

I’m saying wrong way think we, race, rather lose 100 old people covid 1 kid. honestly, I’d rather lose 1 million old people one kids  Given seeing t-cell responses, *very* likely measured years, possibly decades. wonder too. point vaccines go unused becomes clear everyone wants shot received one, open everything back hope hell mutate variant vaccine cover. saw good news somewhere today--evidence antibodies able adjust variants.

I wonder, though, cruise ships require vaccines. They're perfect incubators. It’s still required.

To apply green card, provide vaccination records. that’s **had to**, didn’t, bye application (or take mandatory vaccines - fee course).

I ended get tetanus shot (was behind one), MMR shot (because apparently US requires *2* shots that, home country required 1 shot vaccinated child) flu shot. brain fucking melting now. ive never heard theory vaccination campaign seems going really slow. What’s holdup? Lack supply? thought SK Bioscience producing AZ vaccine locally. Still doubting? One month lockdown. early. First dose ~50% protection dose still takes 2-4 weeks full respective effectiveness. Also, measure everyone opportunity? equate vaccines open ages/groups, that's wrong, vaccine supply infinite.

Maybe try 3 weeks reach 50% population received second dose, could honestly go even higher that. We've waited year, let's impatient risk lives. quoted. talk multiple mutations. can’t multiple mutations one person. chances copies made, doesn’t increase chances new mutation. That’s genetic drift happens. Nice performance art He's part newly christened republican devil: MEDICAL LEFT. 

Let's see quickly start refusing surgeries cancer treatments. main effect still vulnerable people. Washington confirmed 100 breakthrough cases vaccination 8 hospitalizations 2 deaths. Yes, halfway decent person take simple precautions needlessly put others risk. seen anything 1-12 3 9 yr old makes worried also protected SARS-CoV-1.

Not joke.   Stamp big red V forehead. Lol love it. over, never want see mask again. Though ... common cold see benefit wearing one go grocery shopping take transit. people anti wearing masks? Honestly, dislike much, please please buy disposable surgical masks. studies effective n95s. comfortable breathable. tried cloth masks hated much. ear straps painful, fit poor, got humid quickly. can’t blame people wanting wear masks like, surgical masks perfectly comfortable, don’t hurt, don’t get damp (unless lot talking, case swap new one). stress disorder comes feeling like I’m breathing well, really worried wearing masks would make anxious totally fine surgical masks. bit sore,

They counted side effect. Toronto * god damn good 200 years vaccine science turns still true? 

shocked.

Why fuck anyone think one would different.  fuck research released first completed several months ago.  

And another question, covid, million's have, catch one variants (I know several people have, millions cases)?

Shouldn't things know now?  millions cases year ago, many reinfections?  45% new cases NYC variants, many covid last year recovered?

lack data frustrating... day, likely case someone vaccinated spread it.

Hasn't happened yet know of. Seems less likely every time get info. Bold assume kids stayed home past year plentiful food present parents.

I agree lockdowns we've pretend tough children false .

I also think whole ""other people worse past complain"" thing dumb. Life big suffering contest. Seriously. Last spring/summer thought AZ would one coming hot late year, would big one US. can’t wait still read random comments sub vaccinated individuals still contagious therefore need isolate much.

... saying literally impossible?

Just we’re finding *now* isn’t case doesn’t mean wasn’t right continue isolation confirmed. Same. know people fully vaccinated still feel uncomfortable others homes. messaging really fucked things up. It’s emboldening skeptics convincing vaccinated never going back normal. 4 weeks may misleading, even it’s official. 28 day lockdown October dining gyms etc day 300. Anti vaxxers actually need real reasons support claims. make shit chuck freedom personal opinion. changes nothing. Look Israel fear “changing code” wouldn’t JandJ “scarier”? JJ vaccine means traditional vaccine, uses adenovirus envelope deliver DNA nucleus cell produces mRNA go ribosome. Pfizer Moderna skip step go direct ribosome. 

mRNA one get scared people, wonderfully engineered ONE job. Yes. What? strongest immune systems least number severe cases. argument would like giving Michigan supply freshwater water shortage... Looks like reading comprehension hard 🙄 lot making fun Americans last year too. many people know smug it. also lost sympathy. Mutation based time. Mutation based replication. One variant one genetic variation. “extra mutation” based larger pool variants.

The links don’t mean anything don’t understand linking to. got incredibly lucky research Corona viruses mRNA technologies ten years deep. 

Next HIV vaccine, already killed 30+million.  Everyone else's lives always risk also. Watch dehydration dropping blood oxygen. Go hospital early needed rather later. Pulse oxymeter really useful here, simple scale measure water loss (1 pt = 1 lb). don’t know taco seasoning recipe you’re using mine equal parts garlic onion powders. Wow that's clever! moderna American.

BioNTech German Janssen (J&amp;J) Belgian Billions people won’t vaccinated. mutate guess wait see.  accurately, knew would need rent car trip, waited long haggled prices one.  Moderna already trialing 351 boosters. replied exact point. populace think like say “don’t worry won’t kill everyone go back normal even tho kids aren’t immune. die harder”. It’s bullshit they’re priority one. Q boards number 99.7% survival rate. think use Israel's numbers. vaccines teach immune system look for. virus shows up, info virus Welcome knock immunological defenses. mom thinks vaccine crazy Borg assimilation thing changes dna. absolutely doesn’t all. natural immune system given heads look for, fundamentally altered dna level. Please, much info assuage people’s concerns. worried mrna vaccine get j&amp;j. take harmless adenovirus (they common) give info coronavirus. Getting covid possibly dying getting long hauler effects something ever wants go through. kid given top three (by long shot) worst infections life. Like “I might go hospital this” infections. Nasty nasty stuff.

It doesn’t help thinks coughing directly mouth hilarious. Better yet don’t go bloody restaurants! left side at. Give 4A day. CDC says need get tested vaccination symptoms. inconvenience see wouldn't, though.  test soon. Also, 90% effectiveness 100%. 90% big effect spread population. 10% individual risk still something consider returning normal activities. MN opened everyone today, source: MN family still lives vaccine site people faint get shot already laying bed observation area. he’s worried logistically fairly easy solve. mRNA vaccines considerably better others trials, much better nothing really matter get everyone dosed start thinking boosters. I’m totally assuming whatever reported phiser equally true moderna (within percentage points)

This reasonable.  Big, true. summer coming! It’s time shine! rest world ducked covered, always case America UK, centers global capitalism, would actually pull us pandemic. countries biopharmaceutical infrastructure distribution trust handle project. praise heaped countries like New Zealand ""fighting virus""....where world-saving vaccines?  drastically change behavior, yes.

Otherwise, no. certainly ask blood type got vaccine, even know blood type. Sounds like load shit ask Yeah, lot people ignored that. putting something blood exist year ago. 

And million ways screw up. Especially going quickly might start order based one email. 

It better damn well quality control place! Hey atleast delay people getting life saving vaccine. Imagine feel. ""Yh im guy fucked vaccine global pandemic"" pretty stupidly obvious; it’s safe you, safe guests, they’re unvaccinated neighbor. CDC guidance says exactly fully vaccinated grandparents visiting unvaccinated daughter children daughter’s unvaccinated neighbors also come over, visit take place outdoors, wearing well-fitted masks, maintaining physical distance (at least 6 feet). _This due risk two unvaccinated households pose one another._

I guess there’s implied “you’re shitty host don’t mask solidarity guests health.” almost everyone work got vaccine, we're still alive Medical scientists trained say ""we know"", certain. frustrating everyone else, times. joke right? Oh right cautionmanagement spews misinformation subreddit left right 

You blocked every vaccine company produces UK go said country delivers EU, bought hundreds millions vaccines, must export countries.

Gotcha Vietnam asian country 1/6th GDP US. foreign correspondents stationed full time Vietnam. Ergo, Vietnam exist except make point China every media. absolutely reason steer conversation way. Please avoid future. times. recovered month half reinfected. seem recovering bit faster time, I'm kind starting improve 4 months out.  conservatives already shitting over, ""vaccine passports""? agree perfect world, also know realistically people fight getting vaccinated people would fight system propose. mean, though. studies show that.

The first shot great, second dose needed higher levels immunity (because extra 5% people sure would like immunity) helps longer term immunity. don’t understand downvotes. clearly point, virus mutate it’s possible vaccine-resist variant comes someday. sub overly optimistic actually turning circle jerk. never even realised bad flu first place.

This, much. Lots people get sick year, experience symptoms somewhat harsher regular cold, assume ""well guess flu"". opposed stronger-than-usual cold. Real flu knock ass, even young UK whole 4 cases CVST among AZ doses last report well. Premature claim Meh... vaccine sucks anyway would rather people right make choices open vaccine available anyone wants it. I’m fan AOC, yes bartender, think people forget international relations economics degree Ivy League school. She’s exactly underprivileged. Curious mRNA vaccines easier produce adenovirus vaccines? Wonder that's played factor J&amp;J AZ issues production pfizer/moderna seemingly move along swiftly every time someone praises J&amp;J, everyone Europe quick remind us Janssen based EU? Asking friend. data would compared countries closed schools kept closed, likely plays biggest factor children carriers.  flew Southwest two days ago majority middle seats filled. Avoid politics. Viruses don’t learn anything. They’re even alive Welcome Canada socialized medicine. 

They increase capacity little there's much red tape health care system hard anything meaningful quickly. 

It's wild think US going see events spectators time neighbors still lockdown. 

It's wild see badly Canada done vaccines rollouts. They're getting things ramped up. 65 year olds starting get vaccines anyone age 16 US pretty well get vaccine now. I'm confused comment. live BC, quite lot contact tracing someone lab confirmed case covid. Every restaurant takes names phone numbers alert need quarantine exposure. situations, find source virus anyone may exposed. I've close contact before, they're pretty depth. ONE TIME

So much crap there. local news comments (I know read them) aside &lt;insult group people unsuccessfully waited storm great people believe effective original strain, prevent transmission, one vaccinated person getting sick means work all. Hell, people understand UK variant made home town. much ignorance &lt;opposite Exactly. point, time admit anyone talking ""freedoms"" ""privacy"" selfish anti-science conspiracy theorist. There's zero reason provide unlocked communications device medical history border control traveling (domestically internationally), everyone's safety. 

They China without complaining. Paywall. someone copy paste? meant US get faster. Sounds like hypocrite ask me! Freakin flip flopper. /s simple bartender.

Prepare mocked GOP. can't say ""trust science"" ""trust CDC"" propaganda saying opposite scientific data is. 

It creates conflict gives vaccine deniers reason double down. get call media lies manipulates, disregarding data actually fluid always changing. data changing, message too.

If anything, new data push people towards vaccine..but CDC conflicting messages scrutinized. can't trust population act good faith, trust government act good faith what's best interests people? (Especially since case straight spreading falsehoods fit agenda) I'd say embarrassment really Emergent's fault.  Israel right somehow still infect us, even kill us.  Well rarely. problem spreading first known cases people developing COVID-19 completely vaccinated confirmed Tuesday Washington, according state [Department Two potential deaths investigated.  states multiple phases degrees social distancing. guessing game. need read publicly available information. Today: - Tests: 1,475,927 - Cases: 64,925 - Deaths: 1,086 - Currently Hospitalized: 37,412 - Currently ICU: 7,127 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: nice surprise -- I'm glad see worked something mod team restored! still carry virus spread even vaccinated it. stop wearing mask now? :) Lol surprised, canada done form contact tracing even data provide. think necessarily weather dependent, since plenty warm places major case spikes right now, probably true we're long past point policy US major impact whether people actually gather. realize already vaccine requirements quite countries? suspicions Pfizor, makers Viagra, version might use. Honestly, isn’t even unsafe vaccinate Pfizer/Moderna shot think CDC pretty much [confirmed vaccinated people don’t spread messaging flawed lot mRNA research going cancer treatment/prevention prior COVID. significant amount therapies (over half days) give heme-onc clinic protein based immunotherapy. Misleading title... ADULT residents. true. need triple getting large populations currently getting vaccinated, vaccinated ASAP. They're making lot people want get vaccine messaging saying ""nope vaccine changes nothing, lives still basically over."" problem infection leads chance mutation immune vaccinations. Letting get infected runs risk again. UK can't export vaccines available export. first 100m vaccines literally bought paid UK. they've produced 100m AZ free export anywhere want.

The difference EU would seizing vaccines countries bought paid for.

Distinct difference two. Learn it. AZ &amp; JJ, standard vaccines

I call adenovirus vector vaccines exactly standard. E.g. EU, one approved AZ coronavirus vaccine. adenovirus vectors use purposes vaccination, though.

One reasons new vaccine platforms developed first place ease manufacturing. conventional 'standard' vaccines inactivated attenuated pathogen active ingredient, means dealing large amount live pathogen manufacturing. 'genetic' vaccines (DNA (in vector), RNA) get around that.  UK lockdown till June I'd get tested. suspect covid better get tested asap make sure isn't. want unknowingly covid spreading around vaccine funded administering 1+ million shots day Biden took office. last administrations policy's virus sucked funding getting vaccine arms citizens better country world time (minus Israel Bahrain). Biden magic vaccine roll month. understand making mistake scale even possible. hope they're cooking vaccine former Meth Lab. hire Assistant Manager McDonalds run operation? thing keep saying getting downvoted for. 

No one checking anything. Take information it.  Obviously ""police"" it. give vaccinated people bracelet something indicates maskless event like plane ride concert.

It easy develop standardized app quickly provide proof vaccination. I'm sure there's already something works allowing airplane travel countries thing. would standardize process things Good. let’s shut fuck calm Christ sake. Nothing 100% effective. Bull Shit news lol 😂  Well one ""leader"" exact opposite Biden Harris look played out.

There's nothing wrong masking leading example. welcome. think might still possible one mutation could create virus could escape existing vaccines natural immunity. much less likely feared. still need minimize probability, course. unusually high amount tests come back also: 


Wisconsin reported astounding 17,539 coronavirus test results, first time we’ve seen testing 10,000 since February 25, results single day since November 21. don’t know reason state many test results time. include people tested first time tested positive first time.
There 563 positive tests batch, mere 3.21% think that’s left point VA, NJ, AL, OR, HI, DC got second shot today! didn't...? Yes, I’m planning getting school starts, I’m Kansas Calm dude starting warm up. happens, people gather outside. happens, infections happen outside.

It's rocket science.

And really telling start talking group hung outside little birthday ""party"". headline, would've thought party would ""superspreader"" event.

But no. mention infections stemming party. ""they going much face variants"".

Utter trash. Federal officials attributed mistake human error. shit. kind error there? Betcha society leaves big ol turd right carpet then.

But, train on. Agreed That’s possible. It’s also possible person thinks virtual interaction good virtual interaction bad reading social cues. guess we’ll never know. battle.

Variants war   course it’s valid scared. still dangerous fraction population gotten vaccine doesn’t mean everyone safe. many people waiting get it. Almost 1000 people US died yesterday. That’s lot people. It’s yet much want be. butthole bandit says, “Rah rah wanna smell!!” Getting bombarded downvotes take ""die disfigured muh economy"" understand make people drains society right?

I want tax dollars help people revel facebook science. thoughts exactly. 

It's feel-good move political upside. logical. let mitigation *after* everyone crack acquiring immunity. Brief blimp Yet covid restrictions still last forever reason  include millions doses magically showed Italy plant company sent necessary regulations EU approve claimed totally going EU got caught? data also counters much Fauci others saying regarding acceptable post-vaccine behaviors since Covid vaccinations started. think CDC mostly concerned people vaccinated. people going out, drinking dancing, either get vaccinated, soon after.  really want everyone get vaccinated... Except toddlers. washing hands probably important re: COVID, still poop germs message help create press release timeline works better you. signed volunteer months ago nothing available No, called people affected virus developing natural immunity passed on.

Really, fucking stupid force population get vaccine virus gives 99.9% symptoms, ill effects, go away weeks. think brain COVID hysteria morons broken right now, there's literally brain cells left. That’s case Missouri too. live St. Louis, lucked got appointment 5 minutes house, lot people drive hours rural parts state get vaccine. start rollout, governor sent many doses rural counties throwing away due lack demand leaving STL KC begging doses. Antivaxers factually murder you. I'll get vaccinations go live Mars helps quality life... Also... Mars. situation describe second paragraph science fiction, full stop alternative there? Many people need second shot AZ completely unreliable deliveries. do? keep large stock give second shot agreed date.  Question: friend got second Moderna shot Saturday discover roommate tested positive COVID today. friend get tested? What’s right protocol here? kids? 16+ thought entire point vaccine reported them. suggest same. accusation line, esp rn. hard trust article, first sentence demonstrably incorrect. Covid cases rise week, decline, stated article. WTF? Please ban sub relevant month two. anyone link direct press release they're citing article? *This Vaccine Matt Gaetz uptick patient ventilor covid hospital Manhattan. 6 8 weeks still enough time people fuck up, get vaccinated please. Oh yeah adding mRNA vaccines work variant - every vaccine use west works it. lock 13 months many folks (tech companies example) still estimating sept/oct return normal. instead last 0.2 it’s like 26*6/(6+13) = 8.2 miles go. 

A lot folks willing go initial lock slow spread learn disease save folks risk. learned ton risk gotten vaccine original agreement met minds. 

Personally hoping tech company estimates wrong mid June:
1) people chance get vaccine 
2) hit 50% + 2 weeks cases start plummeting month cases handful less per day counties. Huh... almost like 95% efficacy 100%

Math hard right gang? Today first time visited business without mask year. took signs governor lifted mandate weeks ago customers. felt awkward AF, raw-dogged shit air great. cant wait til we're back normal-ish.

Disclaimer: staff wearing masks I'm fully vaccinated. read antibody test them, actually swab nasal cavities viral load. viral load nasal cavity mean nothing's getting transmitted there's nothing transmit source? find google Somewhere exporting them? 

Even been, say Germany, would first inoculated population first. varies significantly amongst recipients. vast majority immunocompromised patients robust reaction various vaccines. People severely immunocompromised different situation - late stage cancer, example. we're talking people HIV Lupus - generally robust reaction. Say again! No.  think two linked.

A better community would handle way included people rather excluding them. multiple options.  order I’d employed them:

a) express discontent original admin post, give time see bosses respond.

b) sticky posts topic regular uses aware

c) go media (I think “Reddit protects pedo supporting employee” enough story (without blackouts) get media traction shame firing her.)

d) pick “don’t log Reddit day”, encourage users participate (but let voluntary.

e) quit protest

I don’t think I’d ever shut sub protest. wouldn’t feel like right that. I’m fan kind protest negatively impacts others.  Peaceful marches along organised routes, definite yes.  Impacting others (e.g., chaining stuff), no.  matter worthy cause, think it’s disrespectful others take control space like that. 

In long run, don’t think tactics good Reddit.  Less inflammatory methods better everyone. Shows masks effective protection God, cant wait sub becomes irrelevant people Right, article UK variant. I'm pointing news stirring shit reason Getting infected death sentence...for like 98% people there. 

If mentality first began, could achieved herd immunity fraction time. 

When think it, strengthening human species allowing bodies fight naturally. learned today pushing pregnant women get vaccine they've found antibodies passed fetus making C19 immune womb. 

Think something called ""survival fittest"" I'm sure. I'm quoting trusted news source, quoting government / hospital information. always hard tell coincidence. 12 cases short / small vaccine program caused worry.

He allegedly vaccine, fainted, woke hospital paralysis. 

There (very few) cases facial paralysis BioNTech-Pfizer, too.

BTW, anti-vaxxer. totally encourage people get vaccinated &amp; waiting slot too. trying pass info, patients full picture side effects. good one. care precise reason. I'm curious college student get age group That's thing that's blown mind pandemic. Masks really help keep allergies bay I'm outside!!!!! often easier use posted subreddit rules guidelines follow.

And almost makes look like clear guidelines users follow well, good way rules work lol. think point assume they're going keep letting mutate. cannot force get it. 

So. Booster shots every year then, seems. 

Anything makes mRNA tech cheaper though. Maybe we'll cure cancer. Lol ur stupid Awesome. I’m fully vaxxed now. I’ll continue wear mask long society asks us to, I’m asshole fellow citizens way knowing I’m fully vaxxed. N95s getting retired... Yes. Pfizer Moderna effective ~14 days Dose 1. Pretty good odds. Good news!  2 million Wait, science actively practiced? say.... reasonably different understandings term.

It takes one spark outbreak, depending pathogen.

Even hundreds decade still quite lot.

And one assume they’re accounted, given (dis)incentives space. lol money spent hydroxychloroquine? drove 20 miles away rather wait another 10 days. Well worth it. 3 weeks notice, able schedule second dose close home, tho.  Maybe users Americans? could also world strange obsession America. knows? Bell's palsy quite common. I've it. 

I'm struggling believe could caused spontaneously within minutes vaccine. work like that. typically prodromal symptoms like ear pain. say ohio 34 Vaccinated people got sick 5 hospitalized?

No deaths though. Ok give up! Apparently can’t reply without getting automodded. I’m even sure word phrase triggering it. *Sigh* don’t think understand word rare means. yeah you’re original comment still complete bullshit. Ohio plans remove get 50/100k cases two week period. last update 140 some, 179 two weeks that.

So we're pace hit target end April/Mid-May pace vaccination. Gotcha, yeah read posting this. basically uses adenovirus vector get cells fight spike proteins.

Edit: Thanks, reassures lot! :)  Ty posting! add this, autoimmune diseases also take drugs lot us... (I Crohns disease started Imuran, drug give transplants).

There's guarantee suppressants enough immune response offer protection said. Trying time vaccine doses seems current best suggestion, everyone's immune system different I'm sure enough studies anything conclusive.  war spanning generations. weapon education. fear superstition. struggle old humanity itself. doses distributed states made Holland safe. American plant screwed formula initial production run. Oh FFS. Google people. bad kids get it, I'd side anti-vaxxers vaccine available Sinovac.  Would download vaccine? No. He's talking putting people risk, himself. finished two week wait that's advised second shot assume full effect crept couple quiet pawnshops mask rules get feet wet public store unmasked 

Not I'd like Wal-Mart right reach heavier vaccine threshold helped ease anxiety eventually completely shedding coming weeks Yes. Back normal, thankfully. :) /r/brandnewsentence Whoops meant Unfortunately, current strains virus. Viruses mutate.... Think flu, colds etc. past year mutated 5 times faster flu last 3. 

The antibodies vaccine create within human body eventually dwindle booster shots needed.

I covid-19 March 2020 antibodies after, however last blood test January 2021 showed negligible trace antibodies. Doctors said I, others early could contract recommended getting vaccinated would last another 9-12 months.

Unless herd immunity done (at rate that's possible currently) mutate thus requiring boosters future strains. 

Several studies done Europe, especially Britain supports this.

I really wish compete TOTAL transparency really happened. 👍 yo-yo lockdowns staring become ridiculous linked article you’re still wrong lol Check “Welcome Centers” major highways. ask Stitt....who obviously taken accounting 101 Trump University.

From standing start, humanity produced two new mRNA vaccines, four new adenovirus vectored vaccines (five count Sputnik heterologous vaccine two) neither ever used vaccines.

Plus Novavax likely soon approved protein subunit vaccine Russian EpiVacCorona.

They're constantly pushing back in-person visits residents staff testing positive - even vaccinated residents staff. vaccinated January.

On plus side, nobody getting sick beyond minor cold-like symptoms. single positive case means can't visit.

I wonder true. maybe nursing homes testing much since vaccinations? I'm definitely happy people dying anymore, still sucky seen dad person year there's end sight. Wife getting J&amp;J today!!! excited!! ""both routes needed"".

Yes, good most-at-risk groups receive vaccinations ASAP.

Then there's care workers ...care... often most-at-risk-people need taken equation spreading events care homes.

And there's me, specialized freelance hopping around 6-8 care homes regular basis. nice I've tested daily basis almost half year effect missing test (by regulations, I'm required provide negative 48 hours enter care home) and/or one tests showing false negative (rare, possible) would devastating. 

So ... supplies low, delicate balancing getting immunity most-at-risk groups well people regularly getting close contact. Possibly, don’t know. It’s “at least” 6 months since people first get still protected, time tell.

But like you’re pointing out, depending long protection lasts it’s little worrying lot countries might consider lucky simply get 1/2 jabs that’s they’re going get make sure everyone gets least 1, let alone one full set jabs twice year. should? lack social discipline compensate brute force manufacturing/distribution.

Reading article, seems distrust government medicine important factor. government make vaccines available, taking vaccine voluntary. “It caused significant administrative burden uncertainty,” Danny Hendrikse told newspaper. “Ultimately would like colleagues focus making distributing vaccine.”

It’s probably due second part quote.

Are saying story false? facts disprove please link them. makes sense - yesterday reached 4 million doses given NYC.

Yes, sub regularly change views doesn’t mean it’s wrong time Germany’s considered failure every respect I’ve never heard anyone say anything remotely similar that.

Also article German news site based opinion Germans it’s hardly view sub. NYT article wrong, according total weekly CDC data Florida, excess deaths state 40,000 time 28% excess deaths reported covid deaths, compared 10% nationally. sadly.

Biden Administration keeps saying get vaccine things go back normal feel like exact opposite also don’t believe Chinese government data, fully expect numbers well US.

“Quarantine” China completely different thing US. know people gone year without seeing families. Also, masking already culturally common thing pandemic. Yeah, probably British minorities capable getting themselves, nix idea. Yes among people haven’t received doses. One dose offer lot protection protection shots provide don’t fully kick 2 weeks second shot. go even farther can’t even say got sick important, vaccinated exposed virus week later still get sick. bother recently. think take alone classroom(I'm teacher) able actually breathe fresh air feels great. Teaching talking hours end mask gets super stuffy uncomfortable, want thing past. pray God improve vaccination length six months way full year, much like flu vaccines. I'd rather less vaccinations year more, less time consuming costly. Yep, Georgia drive 30 minutes north city get opening. know sure drop due vaccine due spring?

For example nyc last spring saw 90% drop vaccine, due spring/lock etc That’s works. standard operating procedures everything, either procedures good enough training good enough. Human error almost never accepted root cause error like this. using used. Extremely stupid false equivalencies. 
Media outlets? Media outlets aren’t reliable sources. people crying EU commission. rollout abysmal failure they’re scrambling keep jobs. no, ccp always right thankful whole transparency. Astra mRNA. uses adenovirus Sounds good, thx! probably stack way, without data back up, knows. point start see data coming UK Canada, tell us definitively effect delaying second dose have. export restrictions AstraZeneca's vaccine critical issue Pfizer. Besides, EU dispute US, Pfizer's ingredients come from. mean vaccine 50% less effective it. typically months ago would maybe 10k last couple weeks would 1k - 4K 

So us 17k actually lot authorised supply allowed come UK. big difference, syntactically, semantically pragmatically “believe science” still want vaccine. Yes, testing shown helps covid people wary possible long term effects, regardless whether they’re likely. call anti-vaccine suggest don’t “believe science”, I’ve received doses Pfizer. understand point though nurse works people it, think it’s silly accuse someone personally doesn’t want vaccine science denier sorts. make difficult all?

Unlike countries currently experiencing cases different underlying variants, SA variant retains control South Africa. IIRC, seen one reported case UK Brazilian variants. presently accounts 99% recorded cases. certainly evade weaken acquired immunity original strain COVID, whilst shown provide immunity known strains well. shouldn’t surprising, given degree weakens efficacy literally every known vaccine. 

It feels bit strange describe way, hover surface given half chance take control. Idk ""many vaccines sitting"" country usage 90-100% Back back daya really good news Pfizer. Im even excited Im fully vaccinated vaccine! Maybe one day low reporting can't skew numbers? think there's often low number Sunday followed high number Monday people enter test results weekend, something Good news, media stop fear mongering variants death?

But either way headline says ""few vaccines"", still misinformation. could 4 months. studied clinical trial happened February. Please explain class ""how works."" people seeing numbers like 10% Germany compared 50% UK 120% Israel.

I can't really think reason would care vaccination history even public went extreme. Suffering effects second dose today. Totally worth able go see Dad suffers cancer isolation year. Maybe multiple states shouldn’t relaxed COVID safeguards literally week two Spring Break, then? Maybe EU stop exports Covax instead make shortfall? hell lot 10 million doses. 

The fact matter EU exported doses kept (obviously vaccine companies making actual vaccines EU) yet yet import 1 dose (if count individual countries buying Russian Chinese vaccines). 

Is much ask EU gets small amount vaccines imported make shortfalls exporting much do? “Suggests” something reduces infection doesn’t mean reduces transmission - Pfizer proven real world actually reduce transmission, vaccine has. roadmap already extended autumn risk variants need booster.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Propaganda. Also media understand rollout = received vaccines vs administered vaccines.

Can't rollout vaccines received. Outdated. becoming clear chances spreading extremely low. vaccinated people really go daily lives. exercise caution around unvaccinated people. Person said continue wearing masks public, like forever. anyone supposed know vaccinated? going throw tantrum store manager says need wear mask? Better question: [How many variants endemic Texas compared America ground zero COVID-cases. happy getting shit together godzilla covid variants morph Brooklyn teenager's boogers. I'd imagine do, though know well work. Czechia several times 15-18 thousands infections per day population 3..7 x smaller Poland. would lime 600,000 infections per day USA.  Right time? US cases control again. Norway — it’s literally illegal fire someone except exceptions. ill certainly one those! enforced, highly disincentivizes leisure travel pandemic, good thing. though? don’t shortage money shipping, vaccinating 16 year old Hawaii opposed 55 year old Michigan doesn’t make much sense. always plan

Provide source claim. Well, one bracing post-Spring Break surge. Everyone knows coming. timed right many states loosening mask restrictions, would surprised DIDN’T see uptick cases many places.  true, people idiots. think frightening part news happens 7 months? 8? 9? efficacy drop exponentially? 50% worse?

Is implication vaccinated person needs full new two-dose hit vaccine every 6 months? that'd pretty pathetic borderline impossible achieve every human earth. see, worse, needing booster annually (although even exactly ideal), need another shot two every 6 months?

I doubt manufacturers could even possibly come supply necessary. perspective, 6 months effectiveness seems pretty dire. Baby, I’d work grammar thought calling someone else idiot. comment isn’t even relevant one replied to, lol. OK, I'm still looking something supported data. condition 90% US workforce? 10%? 1%? know. thought schools already vaccination requirements pre-COVID, unless referring college university. really, shut sooner less cases winter. Regardless, pandemic coming end although michigan surging there's gut punch matter many clicks news source wants agree. Right now, seems China providing vaccines... Many let take partial day. mine take half-day minimum take off, even though could get done back hour.

In case, problem, piles piles PTO stored since gone anywhere year. everyone PTO system bank days across years.

Now, disallowing time getting shot freaking illegal. medical issue.

My company wants us get shot ASAP, get us back office. course told already. :) CDC FDA different definitions seems. Saw today relating Pfizer. vaccine 100% effective severe disease defined U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), 95.3% effective severe COVID-19 defined U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) long everyone, mean everyone, able get vaccinated free, don’t see argument. Unless mean *choose* get vaccinated less privilege do... well, tough. kid rapid onset reaction would apparatus body able recognize virus would indicate body previously developed antibodies. 

I recently received first dose started experiencing symptoms 8-10 days negative antibody tests would concordant. know people illness getting vaccine “bad” reactions (what typically seen 2nd dose) first dose. 

Thus forming non-expert anecdotal assertion strong early response first dose seems indicative prior exposure. Rollout = received vaccines vs administered vaccines.

Which 80%. correlation states loosening restrictions cases rising national scale. think understand Dunning Kruger effect. staying credentials, overestimating abilities. even claimed know anything. honest, think governments around world consider quarantining Brazil viruses control... Right now, danger world. don’t know It’s none business. NY opens everyone 6th cares anyway.  know come on, one two shots don’t think anymore knock people first started talking virus immunity periods last year, first bandwagon saying “3 month” immunity almost certainly permanent. main “catch” mutations. example, get recover flu, body becomes immune specific strain configuration. However, flu many strains mutates fairly quickly. Therefore, get flu year two next years flu probably different strain mutation. 

With COVID, likely same. recover sars-COV2, likely lifetime immunity particular strain. However, different strains may different immune reaction standpoint. don’t know yet. However, mutation rate COVID extent mutations significant enough, likely humans achieve permanent herd immunity current COVID variants near future. 

The factor play “3 month immuity” figure data limitations. like medicine 12 month expiry, doesn’t necessarily mean actually loses potently, identify, efficacy, etc 12 months. 12 months long manufacturer required study parameters. manufacturer studied longer, expiry would likely longer. However, drug companies incentive so. contrary, shorter expirations mean buy drug!

In context COVID, original 3 month immunity figure therefore limited available data. data, could say confidence patients appeared immune least 3 months. additional data published, imagine figure revised much longer 3 months. straight quit last job, notice, boss shamed taking 1 sick day implied faked Covid got shitty handling situation. Fuck that. Similar thing here. It’s company’s best interest people come work sick healthy. told OP consider leaving... popular solution.  And, again, different Texas? That's probably good point. wonder age distribution this, one would think would skewed towards younger due vaccine eligibility like older people did. mainly younger demographic getting covid, give cushion hospitalizations. Giving places besides airports schools medical records, along privileged group another, isn’t ideal. I'm surprised. Usually threads full Trump/Brexiters crowing vaccine programmes make horrendous numbers deaths total mismanagement caused 2020. vaccine “emergency use authorization” (although, yes science looks good effective) seems rash decision line thinking. difference america much racially ethnically diverse.

Especially compared sick days every 15 years. Yeah, too. beginning actually looked doctors nurses trained wash hands. hadn’t realized shitty job doing. Makes wonder hygiene blindspots have. What’s people today sticks asses. I’m saying aren’t gonna come say lasts longer to. It’s best interest you’ll need booster. yearly booster. problem entire former Warsaw Pact ex-Yugoslavia countries. Top 10 infections right region, Czechia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Slovenia. wave extremely hard suppress. Looking data Czechia, number infection deaths went down, enough despite lockdown. lingering problem several months. October’s wave, infection suppressed 4 weeks. Now, work. People tends stay longer hospital, younger demographics affected mortality up. October 1.6% infected died, time 2%. Yeah surely it’s don’t data longer. Good. Nah lost cause. problem, appreciate help. Serious question, solution? virus going forever, supposed wear masks distance literally forever could possibly save one life? 

I’ve sacrificing precautious since start thing, point resume life risk. going seriously tell don’t care kid cancer dies I’m going carry unnecessary precautions presence 3 highly effective vaccines? ""up to"" limit know effectiveness, effectiveness itself. know effective 6 months (so far). may continue much longer. professor wants reschedule 2nd vaccine shot miss exam date?? like bro think lol. Well, saying kids reaction first shot already antibodies infection? sure you’re agenda here, you’re part problem. sad people like exist. people don’t care another wave point. want reopen regardless. one person brought drop off???  Better hope he/she doesn’t make social media platform anything T-cell Mutant Ninja Turtles SAME! Choices consequences. 

You get make choice. it’s body. 

But also take consequences it. 1000% right, isn’t case OP choosing come office sick sick time use. actually making worse rest us.  saw list could confusing Oregon stated open 16+. Washington State announced yesterday April 15th still hope Oregon open May 1st. trying add context let know edit. Yeah, cops totally need reason go power trip, totally new thing source see India vaccine ban 24th March, 8 days ago, thus EU asked known anaphylactic reaction PEG cannot become healthcare worker... discrimination lawsuit waiting happen. always legit reasons get vaccine facilities responsibility provide accommodations. I’m pharmacists pro-vaccine administered 1000’s point. optional, accommodations declinations lawsuits come. There’s alot reality refuse admit. Opening vaccines live certain neighborhoods restricting qualified people neighborhoods wrong anyway slice it. 

If reversing neighborhoods, would much outrage would justified. trying dismiss naturalistic fallacy. Evolution built defenses infection. primary, first line defense barriers. Skin, mucous membranes. Things like that. Internal immune response costly dangerous. least protected parts body barrier respiratory system, respiratory diseases common disease people experience.

And improvements private public hygiene contributed *greatly* reducing human suferring way disease death. Yeah, know want *too clean*, immune systems strong enough resist infections general.

But we're trying live sterile bubbles. We're saying let's super careful shit *temporarily* get rid nasty bug ability save lives actions. *Especially* actions little cost like wearing masks. He's already done it! :) get 70% handful states great. Unfortunately it’s looking right like lot states simply aren’t going get there. It’s better alternative, side effects mean it’s working, laying miserable yesterday saying “at least know wasn’t empty needle” could go that’s false choice know well nobody rooting disease, already know things. might know people listening kind bullshit, viral stupidity. Take grain salt Fox News, but: Ninety percent full-time private sector workers receive paid vacation paid holiday time. 40 percent part-time workers get paid vacation 44 percent receive paid hourly workers, amount paid time tends correlate income. workers top 25 percent received paid vacation (91 percent) paid holidays (93 percent), 52 percent workers bottom 25 percent received paid vacation, 54 percent received paid holiday time.

Edit: keep mind, says receive it, much get... Could single day get put category freebie considering vaccinations help towards ending pandemic. two different comparisons though. Ireland better initial response, UK/US better vaccine rollout. Studies underway, think concluded yet.  Advocating willfully ignorant reckless disregard fellow man become morally correct stance matter many words put front it, persistent replies. 

The bottom line publicly encouraging people take vaccine. Convince pro-vaccine stance however please. Hey /u/Wizmaxman , yo thang. live Seattle too, trying compare lockdown juvenile. incredibly soft true enforcement, entertainment food establishments open 1/3 entire time.

""I know upset"" reason people stop listening lockdown rules NJ shitshow new cases people 40. Guess they're actually safe all. Hopefully drive younger people toward vaccination become eligible.  Hopefully +4m update week. Yeah, bills pay. Often jobs give proper sick leave ones who's employees barely scraping due awful pay. means options go sick, able afford bills. rent alone half paycheck, live partner split rent. can't afford take day two unpaid, work sure hell offer paid sick. think going pretty large gaps highest vaccinated rate lowest states. highest might see 70-75% lowest might see around 50%. said yesterday fully-vaccinated people can't spread virus

This CDC therefore longer need wear masks.

This me. probably could made clear, I'm implying CDC said drop masks. logical conclusion findings. Actually, not.

But wanted drag China this, ya? rapid? soon exposure tests? 

My understanding it’s generally harder get false positive false negative. False negatives fairly common rapid tests I’ve heard. 

False negatives could result swab going far enough, soon exposure still low viral load, etc. 

False positive would like contaminated samples, lab error, etc. 

Not expert that’s I’ve told. Happy corrected I’m wrong! Many states hitting point less half remaining unvaccinated adult population plans get jab. Growth rates going slow unless willingness number increases. Agreed. used flattening curve, people going get lot people going die, want get severely ill once.

Now people's goals? Complete eradication virus? human ever getting sick dying again? ridiculous, people need get back touch reality. Capitalists gonna Capitalism... first shot. don’t take shots well, I’m likely tossing around, laying bed. 2nd one 21 days. literally residency requirement sign outside VDH website like CVS Wallgreens. got parents vaccinated way definitely VA residence. might even one VDH. honestly disgusted. someone know relying healthcare job provides serious issue, two days Thanksgiving literally talking doctor shameful. happy clearly enjoying giving news beyond reproach terms deserving spot hell far I'm concerned. first amendment fuck social media.

There zero first amendment protection social media. Aww thanks! great day! good way get blacklisted field. guess hill want die on. Sheesh, it’s Thursday. incredibly offensive. picture awful. You’re never ever supposed touch needle syringe. That’s give someone infection. Thanks, updated reflect change. Since Fridays Saturdays usually biggest days, definitely able reach 40% adults vaccinated Saturday would day earlier projected! bad adult percentage rate going start slow. don’t see us getting 70% adults mid-May unless see willingness vaccinate rate improve. Many states already hitting point third remaining unvaccinated adults planning getting jab. looks like don’t. credentials aren’t related domain knowledge we’re speaking aren’t relevant slightest. Good. Shouldn’t much longer stop wearing masks social distancing Wow that's terrible familiar unfortunately. got laid similar circumstances last year. pandemic has, unfortunately, massive validator NEETs people. I'm sure lot people acting like we're bad guys wanting live real lives point future, fall category like that. Good luck! First second? got second Tuesday. slightly fever/lethargic first. Second one knocked ass entire next day. Nope literally asked question regarding J&amp;J vs Pfizer got banned  Everyone needs vaccine equally regardless neighborhood one main reasons south side hit harder residents didn’t take precautions way north siders did. They’re benefiting lack care responsibility.

wow.

Yeah, there's bit reality absolutely missing here. anybody know could happen mixing doses? sadly live area know parents get second dose another option would getting pfizer vaccine somewhere else, first dose Sinovac vaccine. vocal minority screaming year watch. IDC want wear mask public try force others thing. Yeah bad, someone else already mentioned I'll point even EU stole doses themselves, would barely make dent rollout would still slow.

The 77 million exported doses enough 17% population EU. They're last weeks news anyway. Problem solved. Depends means reopen. Springtime, need outside open air viral load continuously diluted let sunlight naturally ""kill"" virus well giving us vitamin D. also wonders mental health.

However, definitely early pack indoor places, see around me. Even mandate 50% whatever occupancy, nebulous requirement one follows it. People prioritizing business lives. 

So yea, like beginning 4th quarter game score tied people celebrating already. shame think last people die unnecessarily pandemic, actually end containing eradicating it. mind asking, live? understanding kind ""vigilante"" mask enforcement prevalent certain areas. dying great. 

Feeling like live would better. numbers Brazil, especially deaths, terrifying look charts compare even peak What’s appropriate wait time? pandemic now. Waiting 20 years long term studies isn’t feasible. 

If it’s good enough emergency usage it’s good enough required like vaccine. create incentive vaccinated workers earn more. piled level headed person talking believing stuff read internet.

Romanians Rroma/Romani thing. around 8-10% Romania Rroma ethnicity, quite distinct Read posts. makes 0 sense boy one ones train heading Auschwitz thinking going get nice housing great job you? government experts better job convincing people actually finish line then. People think vaccine even matters nothing changes regardless, feels never ending. Definitely. right armpit 2nd Pfizer last Thursday. gone bit still tender. unusual side effect. scared. CDC said yesterday fully-vaccinated people can't spread virus, therefore longer need wear masks.

Yes, literally say that. Totally anecdotal, think actually effect people wanting get vaccinated, people elligable either realize want bother quite yet. day chatting someone absolutely wanted get vaccine (and elligable) wanted wait others get first. needs messaging telling people *can* get *should* get body. choice. Using logic awful. posted something like sub, y’all would remove uncommon circumvented.  israel let people travel kilometer residence months, allowed dine-in eating all, still really opened schools gonna try apply data U.S.

lmao Again, them. I'm responsible people's bad decisions. own. I'm two weeks past 2nd shot, mask comes good. COVID vaccine acceptance almost 1:1 line IQ test results. J&amp;J capable staying standard freezers, think Pfizer moderna still need kept cold. Ah end day what's important. companies free police user generated content sites, like youtube anything else. That's good old American freedom people like. big businesses making decisions themselves. Belgian company, bought Johnson Johnson.

... 60 years ago community body scientists medical professionals can't stand recommendations one to; choose part professional body choose get vaccine, can't ways. That's fucked. yes, nurse lose ability practice nursing. side effects shouldn’t severe follow boosters. It’ll closer flu vaccines typically cause slightly sore arm secured first vaccine appt. pulled major highway bawled relief. felt amazing stopped! Well hopeful message ad vague ""let beat virus"" nice segments self interest rules. hope self interest ads too.

Money motivates too. IDK general doctor one go online medical chart. went scan chart pull phone times.  

Also cards easy fake, like beyond easy fake assume seeing card wont used know people counterfeit ones. love you. don’t know that. Global climate change may make pandemics frequent. Also random events cause too. Mount Tambora’s volcanic eruption 1815 caused “the year without summer,” widely blamed triggered typhus epidemic. keep pushing isolated habitats like rain forest, spillover new viruses human population expected grow common. mean, could probably wear masks fine. it’s always good take precautions since don’t enough data. Got first round today, arm damn sore sister (aged 30) lasted awhile. normal reaction-that's tell women delay mammograms month vaccination minimize risk false positives. ChAnGe NaNoBoTs! Except ""well I'll wait hits 50%. need go get it"" literally said comment replying to

Not true. comment said nurses know things doctor. That's different saying nurses doctors *because* lack intelligence. I'm going stop replying now. Well can't either. use excuses, like breaking company policy basically every employee does. clamp everbody month forget later. say CDC said stop wearing masks. said said vaccinated people can't spread virus. leads logical conclusion wear masks.

Use reasoning here. vaccinated, carry virus. Therefore can't spread it. Since masks prevent people spreading virus, longer wear vaccinated since there's nothing left spread. I'm southern well. crazy people allowing people fever office, guess everyone different. 

Our policy fever can't office, precovid policy.  nervous heck, got first Pfizer recently. happy see news.  say keeping 1000L+ vats mammalian cells alive, healthy conditions right ""vaccine"" grow particularly easy least initially. 

But yes constraints producing large quantities quickly lower new tech vaccines conventional inactivated/attenuated vaccines even egg based. Well he’s done nothing specifically it, democrats congress house suggested it, I’m personally it. girlfriend got first dose Pfizer yesterday. covid before. feel great, woke morning went gym. can’t even get bed. harder bout virus could factor? weird effects everyone differently. Maybe wrong effects vaccine generally immediate enough captured trial? one-time exposure meant induce quick immune response. I'm struggling think active ingredients would cause LT effects, covid virus itself. stand reason effects could linger would initial ones vaccine, we've seen demonstrated trials happen? articles panic outnumber one ten times over, mean news come differing views truth somewhere middle. I'm sure coming going I'll bow leave it. anus flu shot booster, less different vaccine every year, Td DTaP boosters generally original. also recommended get tetanus booster chance exposed tetanus, even initial vax booster within past 10 years. we're 100% long immunity lasts tetanus shot, know cure tetanus. get it, treat symptoms wait pass, survive. are. feed time get right pissed known attack me. Lol I've googling 'vaccine side effects' (nothing unusual there) 'does covid vaccine prevent transmission?' (A lot articles provide clear answer saying best still adhere social distancing protocol) seen anything different literally yesterday CDC posted findings. toddler get vaccine?  Yes we’ve trying thirty years stop polio longer consider vaccine invented 50’s. point vaccine stops disease abd yet logistically can’t eradicate polio. Covid vaccine 6 monthish stop virus wish did. FYI pharmacist. way life change due disaster. get paid outside sick time FMLA? TDI? 

Right, wouldn’t 2 weeks sick time either 2 weeks would fully paid would borrowing future time. someone exposed lot time off. mention backlash take (which bullshit). cases I’m familiar with, FMLA would protect one’s job unpaid. taking 2 days shot lesser 2 evils cases. Maybe could use short term disability? case wouldn’t even kick first 2 weeks wouldn’t apply. employers shitty. masks effective protection

Well, shows mitigation strategy whole also effective flu. could plausibly nothing masks explained lockdown, home-working social distancing. Correlation causation etc. I'm U.S. way 6 weeks paid sick time saved up, since accrues year year.  around 4 1/2 months now. 

We good job providing social safety nets youngest people lowest income, sometimes feel like people outside U.S. think literally everybody's situation. Redditors tend skew young. Yes, actually first point exactly point would followed with. Never taken drastic measures, still saw outcome. point #2 moot IMO got covid that’s caused die, idc conditions leading that. Sarah who? least 6 months.

No mean anything yet. know. 

I know kind uncertainty sucks year uncertainty life. know till know. correct. Boosters intended bring immunity back protective levels, robustness antibody production declines time. Flu shots basically new shot every year, booster. DTaP Td boosters different concoctions intend protect NEW tetanus pertussis variants, rather boost immunity back protective levels like first vaccine. second Pfizer/Moderna shots good example boosters, difference first second doses, amount concoction, meant stimulate robust antibody production ideally stick around longer single dose. really hope titer levels stay high enough long enough there's enough mutations vaccines become ineffective. live US 25 PTO days per year, plus many sick days need, long abuse it. Sounds like great time ban use cheapest vaccine half population.

(the EMA's position remains safe &amp; effective) sealion time AstraZenica developed primarily Oxford UK funded UK taxpayers. 
ONLY Germany payed money Biotech development reason manufacturing vaccine wide Pfizer massive US corporation.
As far concerned rest EU sitting around like sack potatoes pointing fingers. cool fuck, immune systems complex. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, interpretation newest data mRNA vaccines giving immunity faster expected (probably time second dose), likely last extremely long time.

That said, advocating caution everyone, still *ton* data stuff yet, seems likely scenario would nice, think able get another vaccine within two weeks first second dose. (been voluteering vaccination site) Well like said, don’t option work regardless. office exposed numerous times never closed—we’re south, bosses don’t care. Got second Pfizer FauciOuchie... really ouchie. Day after, felt little lethargic mildly achy. went short hike test body. bit tired usual actually lessened aching. Totally fine day 3. seem really run gamut. dad zero side effects, mom flu like body aches worse mine, brother felt like got hit semi truck throughout days two three. 

Two weeks now, vaccine fully effective, I'm popping champagne. least guys got vaccine state in? know CA, employees entitled additional time including getting vaccinated required days recovery side effects. chicken pox? Covid prior getting vaccine? Generally severe side effects people previously Covid-19, least within past 90 days. Either way sucks. flu basically super mutation coronavirus. It’s constantly changing year year Yes. They’re called intranasal vaccines they’re currently developed. Mayor Bowser stated Washington D.C open everyone 16 May 1st. 

That said, easy access Maryland Virginia many D.C residents opting vaccinate states instead. fair enough, good points. Gotta read qualifier ""at least."" know long lasts yet.

People love outraged days. Especially social media people paid express specific views bots.

Whatever see social media taken heap salt. make media companies money. Software niche government customer. Science takes time. Previously know if, real life circumstances, vaccination could prevent vaccinated person carrying virus still infecting someone, even showed symptoms illness. That’s two different type immunities didn’t know vaccines provided second, no-spread type. lot good data suggested also provided protection secondary spread ethically, scientists can’t say sure data in. It’s week first studies coming say, yes! prevents transmission spread vaccinated person much less likely carry large enough viral load transmit secondary person. Immensely exciting stuff. studies completed know coming days. 

The original advice wear masks maintain distance vaccine keep people safe didn’t know waiting studies transmission. still thing need keep much population well working toward vaccinated population order give virus less chance mutate strain vaccines don’t protect against. numbers game, really. Hope helps you! git rabies series vaccine shots said five years?  Yeah I'm saying idea us needing boosters tetanus bacteria mutates enough possibly avoid detection within 10 years body 'forgets' somehow, precaution tetanus fucking bad there's like risk. 6th month issue probably lot troubling places vaccine rollout struggling. US rate could vaccinate entire US adult population two shots every 6 months. countries aren’t pace able vaccinate entire country year, makes necessity 6th month booster rough. Well assure tech went vaccine American German. main tech modified spike protein US government invented that. mRNA invented Drew Weissman Katalin Kariko University Pennsylvania. end result mRNA same: body produces anti-bodies.

The route get different, end result same. lot folks don’t seem know B cells exist, let alone do.

Because b cells overshadowed cells get cool names like natural killer cell

Out interest drawbacks b cell treatment, like effect rest immune system; 2020 course That’s cool! assumption vaccines become ineffective time fading immunity, variants. guess memory cells really amazing. accurate. Another poster noted tetanus boosters every 10 years. memory antigens declines time, boosters bring immunity back protective levels. enough time body active producing robust antibodies things encountered, protective immunity declines. Thus, boosters. flu shot booster, less different vaccine every year, Td DTaP boosters generally original. also recommended get tetanus booster chance exposed tetanus, even initial vax booster within past 10 years.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People react strongly first dose second. booster, asked around nothing definitive yet. seems Pfizer doesn’t see need one now? least asked (researchers) said they’re thinking sure yet think vaccine works well enough variants booster unnecessary they’re sure anything (this February) therefore answer “we sure” 

6 months highly promising couple months know better long vaccines work. reason they’re saying participants (phase 3) reached 4th follow (6 months) since receiving vaccine whereas phase 1 people it’s year almost. can’t say “oh definitely year forever” least ask (Pfizer) say things like “it’s likely/unlikely” “we hope case” “things promising suspect continue “ “there guarantees” mostly “we don’t data — hasn’t long“ “ need data” I'm saying thought second one booster explained people seem worst side effects second shot (a booster) first shot. 

Six would third, booster, also hit harder first shot?

Just asking question. Tetanus 

Not virus. accurate. Another poster noted tetanus boosters every 10 years. memory antigens declines time, boosters bring immunity back protective levels. enough time body active producing robust antibodies things encountered, protective immunity declines. Thus, boosters. flu shot booster, less different vaccine every year, Td DTaP boosters generally original. also recommended get tetanus booster chance exposed tetanus, even initial vax booster within past 10 years. What? Even variants quite virulent immunity we've got right? Uhhh absolutely fair compare that's infections diseases work real world. peaks troughs. argument make sense. earth would apply worst months x 12 months ever happen real world?

Two points could make one either direction.

1) death numbers mitigation strategies used may higher may beaten them.

2) Many people died covid-19 severe heart disease cancer frequently give people low survivals. someone severe heart failure stage 4 cancer got covid infection died counted covid death despite fact frail probably would died year due diseases though exact moment.

#2 give respect horrible heart diseases even Lion's share covid deaths taking people heart disease still number one cause death. think argument whether worthwhile use sick time covid vaccines, course worth it. argument everyone sick time cover things like this, ridiculous. becoming clearer Pfizer's (and Moderna's I'm guessing) vaccine best show, speak. employee sure vaccine well. symptoms persisted got tested. I’m still thinking conservative type test.  liability litmus-like strip. lick doesn’t turn green... probably don’t Covid (or aren’t shedding much virus yet anymore. estimated $.75 could rolled mass quantities August. That's first real world data south African strain, one bit concerned about. cool. ARe???? Judging post history, you’re lost cause “man”. Ahhh.

God Bless America!

/s (if wasn’t abundantly obvious) mark professional record would appropriate. FIL returned China last summer (had bribe friend friend get ticket) he’s going time living life. Don’t think he’s worn mask since US. exact opposite would happen. feel like getting second shot, generally worse get first immune system recognizes vaccine already defense it. feel bad strong defense. stronger immune system reacts, worse feel. vaccine making feel bad, immune system gives fever, aches, chills See, got downvoted hell suggesting try get infected whatever want, can't try spread people.

I thinking time helminthic therapy, quickly reminded story roommate tried give auto-brewery syndrome whatever called. Also STDs ""touchy"" subject regard (heh).

Anyways, I'm sure idea full bodily autonomy goes ways equally. That's I'm saying. spike protein lot conserved area. cannot mutate way untargetable least form modified spike protein vaccine, thank god. Similarly cannot become untargetable least designer antivirals. Idk reason don’t believe true. years don’t change flu vaccine strains covered. That’s never made sense me. I’m waiting call crisis southern border. Packing people cages without social distancing, 10% testing positive virus. What’s science that? Considering Germany second country world based investment vaccine development (only behind USA), I'd pissed well. lot new variant, b117 whatever they're calling it. University Michigan outbreak athletic department beginning year, presumably European student athlete travelling home. union construction work area, local power plant instituted mandatory testing twice week aftermath situation.

That coincided states opening, states population. 4 5 major universities new variant spreading march. populations made this....very political, idiots plotting kidnap murder governor. Now, Backtrack fear retaliation. 

So many people thought would okay due vaccines becoming available, they're scarce state. I've working Nothing power plants hospitals, qualify, travel get mine. I've also learned dknt antibodies month half first dose, available now, really helps us come may june.

This data saying, “we’ve monitoring people 6-months still strong immunity. We’ll keep monitoring see immunity dips future, now, know lasts least 6 months.” case flu, it’s influenza evolves fast it’s adaptations make likely evade immunity... somehow.

We thankful coronavirus; much stable genome. called ""AstraZeneca vaccine"" developed UK voted leave EU 2016 officially leave EU 2020. here. animals care sick not. Wait find health insurance 😉  they’ve tracking data six months so, statement booster shots foreseeable future? buddy says won’t take it’s “new unproven tech mrna stuff “ he’s also Republican I’m surprised. big personal downside virus I’ve gotten past year development eye wrinkles. smile bigger people know smiling. fact u limited days u get sick outrageous think biggest thing hoping workplace would allow flexibility taking time continue get boosters, recover side-effects might experience.

I received first Pfizer dose last week — second dose 15th, late afternoon — that’s Thursday I’m worried I’m going feel awful next day (a Friday), productive/feel well work. I'm way. rarely get sick, maybe every years. think paranoia sanitation going good health long term.

I someone absolutely believes vaccinations wearing masks (while still going on). chemicals hand sanitizers people using like water cannot good long term. ""98% survive!!!"" = 49 50 survive = 1 50 die Yah I’m self employed get none lol. Right Antibodies fade time. immune system complex, levels immune cells work. Memory T-cells reactivated re-exposed virus. show antibody test. know healthcare workers (2) vaccinated December got recently. Super mild, tested positive. means you’re vaccinated get give it.

We can't stop life 5% people get Covid. must move on. high rates vaccine hesitancy amongst poor black people US result history racist treatment medical community?

While I'm normally sympathetic relate tangential level (am female appalling mistreatment older male doctors), sympathize case. global pandemic killing millions people time set aside hangups day get vaccinated. clearly something tested certain demographic detriment like things past, think people need separate feelings sake society health/safety families. It’s “new” point. Hundreds millions people vaccinated minimal side effects. don’t want mRNA vaccine get old school J &amp; J. Personally, I’d take mRNA dead virus vaccine. unvaccinated people getting it, means they’re also building immunity period time great. Science shown Covid isn’t deadly kids seasonal flu. Stop moving goal posts. accept restrictions ""possible"" effects may may occur. think aren’t sure still T-cell protection even antibodies longer measurable. makes ashamed profession many nurses refuse it. again, opt run degree mills instead scientific, evidence-based education, else expect? Student Nurses spend time writing papers Florence Nightingale’s life learning anything actually matters scope practice. 

For example: none nurses batted eye required get Hep B vaccine, around roughly 10 years mRNA vaccines developed. They’ve bought whole “it’s new” “we don’t know” “some political horseshit” arguments don’t know research outside social media. don’t know blame never even taught to. 

I mean, honestly. vaccine cleaner ingredient list McDonald’s hamburger we’re worried long term effects?? every right get vaccine doesn’t want it.

And employers right decide want disease vectors what? Expressing opinions personally disagree with? think I’m fine whatever want, thanks

I’m expert doctor rudimentary understanding body would react much. likely side effects booster jab. Hot take, man! Maybe ought write article Wall Street Journal. I'm sure they're itching present side story. can't wait mask burning day! absolutely awesome. true, getting closer. hold forts guys, keep safe get vaccinated. numbers worldwide vaccines virus dies off. Two shots. ended sick first likely end sick second. want use sick time covid vaccines? folks sick time experience intense side effects? Data also shows 99% us fine. mortality hair higher flue, non existent children. really major danger elderly unhealthy (obese, diabetic, lacking vitaminD exercise). Anyone normal immune system kicks easily like corona viruses deal yearly.. sadly half us reading post not. Lets get healthy next bad virus emerges. Vaccines reactionary (not them), health proactive first line defence. 350 million people get revaccinated every 6months year? Yeah, sure going work well... countries turned away expensive Pfizer Inc. covid doses favor cheaper version AstraZeneca Plc paying Croatia, Estonia, Latvia Slovakia, declined part Pfizer allotments wait Astra doses, among slowest bloc administer vaccines, according European Union document seen Bloomberg. Pfizer met commitments, Astra delivered 30 million originally committed 120 million doses first result, Bulgaria Croatia expected vaccinate 45% populations middle year, according document, lowest EU Czech Republic. Estonia vaccinate 50%, Latvia 53% Slovakia 46%. compares 61% Germany, 80% Denmark 93% Malta. seems possible likely. 

Even that, mention distribution outpaces administration. 

It's still possible rate vaccination increase. previously said year. virus 99.99% recovery rate. I'll put bets immune system antibodies every right get vaccine doesn’t want it. read article said supports people getting it, doesn’t want moment. isn’t spreading misinformation, especially she’s **encouraging** people get it. it

Stop what? Expressing opinions personally disagree with? think I’m fine whatever want, thanks yeah got first dose it’s fine. folks team got second take day second felt poo poo.  Wow employer must shitty let take sick day every 6 months! It’s getting vaccine side effects. *takes big hit*

“Mmmmmm, rat urine!!” Try powering re-booting. could still skin clothes, going reaerosolize case, extremely unlikely anyone would get enough nose eyes infect them. Also coronavirus surfaces easy take care soap water, wash hands. experience side effects, may need take time work. Even called moderate scenario. Can’t get best case scenario?!? 😂 biotech manufacturer, makes sense this. actual operators floor rarely depth knowledge making, important thing follow SOPs letter common sense guess idea make SUPER robust vaccine produces neutralizing antibodies, it’ll get rid HIV time insert genome? maybe would immediately neutralize virus soon emerge hiding? Tricky though, since natural human immune response ever able that. Many people questions anxiety new vivid vaccines traditionally ""die-hard anti-Vax people"" though, lumping together tactic, conscious otherwise, discredit concerns dismiss questions. serious, something incredibly sad employer value health enough let take 2 hours work. charge insurance company. EU struggled leadership vaccines hardly position make credible assessments anyone's management. never agreed personally called thread. takes 15 minutes get one .. mornings, nights, weekends.. Apologies dumb question, people involved phase 1 trials mRNA vaccines fully vaccinated 7-8 months? thought trials began last summer could wrong. that's case, know sure protection lasted 6 months testing antibodies? Exactly. probably make sense last summer, since COVID everywhere. point fuck people honest enough comply them.  really sell this, need Dr. Fauci announce offer two free masks every completed vaccine card. Maybe autographed doctor himself. Alternative link: Every single day week I'll trust someone medical degree understands science behind vaccines viral transmissions people who've ""had it"" wearing mask. people experts fields know infinitely what's required defeat virus people tired all. 

I enjoy it, I'd like done it, wearing mask distancing others really big deal, here's people seem understand: we're living pandemic. virus give shit sad, feelings hurt, cant stand wear mask longer. medically sound strategies going help us get faster. Looks like 10M (current deliveries) + 24M + 50M would put 85M end May. delivery target 100M end June they'd easily hit goal still.

Although article says goal end May...so would put 15M short goal! absolutely are, EU. Ok clinicals requires vaccines reason uh..idk work around infectious disease! says rotation paperwork whatever school required, flu shot required too. Another fun fact, least program im health insurance required, work around infectious disease. yea...its surprising. always required great deal healthcare, one bothered required get flu shot. Y’all bunch pussies would smart would listen science start using Astra-Zeneca stockpiles. bad UK good? almost exclusively used AZ dealing pandemic look compared say Germany, France. Night Day.  


BTW blood clots people saying happen AZ literally less 1 hundred thousandth took way less 1 percent chance happening. use analogy: ""You chance asteroid hitting head walk street Astra-Zeneca causing blood clot. total number blood clots 30s tens millions. Simple math guys. top rate blood clots lower UK whole happened covid year. FYI. ""Abundance caution"" reason stop giving vaccine ludicrous facts. Seriously, hard say ""Pfizer Jab Remains Effective Six Months Post-Vaccination"" something like that? Current rate vaccine distribution US 3.77 million day. current rate doses administered 2.83 million.

Enough shots given 30% adult population, 23% total population.

Outside hesitancy, reason think can't get 50% adult population vaccinated end month? Daily attempt getting appointment successful morning.

1st dose Pfizer tomorrow wife. Feels good, man. There’s various studies publishing effectiveness Pfizer multiple variants, wonder pessimistic friend. current spike cases less variants states opening things early people thinking it’s safe take masks off. theory old peopel get vaccinated infected number 1 cause immune escape mutations basicly provingground virus. got covid vaccine got stupid Microsoft update. I’m saying lift restrictions throw bone here. Say something hopeful. think lumping people hesitant valid questions regarding vivid vaccines traditional anti backers disingenuous argument. 

Many many people anxiety new vivid vaccines people otherwise believe vaccines, kids vaccinated, vaccinated themselves. 

Someone questions new vaccine technology, unknown long term effects, lumped together someone refused vaccinate children, substitutes use antibiotics essential oils garlic. 

It potentially dangerous argument allows people dismiss everyone questions new vaccines. Suddenly unreasonable person hesitant take experimental medical treatment long term data yet granted approval FDA. Yep! clinical sites won’t take students cohort refused vaccine. personal motto? Fuck em. Well next time amazing EU leaders sign contracts time put money vaccine research don’t exact problem. used call common sense. Understandable, knowledge, separate freezer vaccines ""special"" use black people. Fellow Masshole here. wait bad till NY changed policy. April 19 feels like decade away! *sad B1 Battledroid noises* sorry hear that, I'm sure mean. wear masks social distance forever toddler cancer? Ok every adult US get vaccinated month, doesn’t matter! Still gotta mask distance. adult choice vaccinated choose to, that’s you, me. magical vaccines sitting around nothing? 

It's shit people getting UK tabloids. vaccines sitting around nothing 2nd doses. 

I think going one dose first better collective strategy mean unused vaccines, countries following vaccine manufacturers said do.

My mother (cancer patient) getting vaccinated right around now, they'll 2nd dose ready three weeks regardless supply issues not. stop-and-start precautionary approach either. individual countries' decisions halt AZ.

And minority EU countries. suspended 2-7 days countries. think paywalled pertains Covid, here's relevant couple paragraphs:

Dr. Khaldeen, state's chief medical executive said Tuesday 50% state residents 65 fully vaccinated...\[Khaldeen also said\]...the significant increase hospitalizations state people 50's, group still risk becoming severely ill dying Covid. Younger people driven rapid increase cases recently, said, including high school students participate sports... city, around another 15,000 NYC suburbs. entirely wrong entirely right either. would suspect companies like FB, Twitter Amazon control vast majority information that's posted public web. get together decide opinion X banned platform pretty much effect feds banned opinion X. They'll offer let pick both. Often demand higher J&amp;J sites see run first morning. Judging morons keep posting ""it lasts 6 months? WTF!"" 

This would explain many people getting vaccine choice, going public caring it, wearing masks, covidiots Q-morons, opening everything 100% way early (I'm looking home state Texas). 

/SMH  never vials wrong ingredients them. thrown packaged. Wednesday report(or day tbh), fantastic! agree however that's exactly way system designed. written going home overcrowded shift (we took turns leaving, turn, eye infection easily spread type work did) decided send someone else home instead. left sick written following shift HR put 4 sick days within 11 months. April 5 opening day according article, CDC info current. Avoid reposting information. evidence trial says vaccine high efficacy *at* 6 months, evidence high efficacy SA variant. means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future. know long amount time passed. could year, could also 5 years, 10 years, indefinitely.

Bottom line: means *less* likely we'll need booster shot. we've studying mRNA vaccines 20 years.. know ingredients. know do. come new flu vaccine every year. manufacturer.. everyone wants end pandemic. yeah, go anti-vaxxer want. stay wood society. America. Doesn’t anything “brown people” call them. you’re going arbitrarily restrict otherwise qualified people getting give preferred people first based politics, yeah, I’ll jump line anyone else. Don’t play identity politics pandemic. get shots arms. Yup heard recent study actual peasant time work current day US blue collar workers. Ha! **Stop. Spreading. Misinformation.**

People got 6 months ago **not** officially, unofficially, need again. study lasted 6 months. means 6 months data, say certain people safe 6 months. Absolutely nowhere said received need another dose 6 months.

You read title, twisted it, added false information, trying spread twisted false information fact.

**Stop it.** OP mentioned relative easy program right. easier lot health care profession term schooling less competition doctorate programs unless CRNA/NP.

All health professionals make sacrifice including major holidays, birthday birthday. Many doctorate program sacrifice 20s make happen. seniority, request day want. Make sure ask tell one want. want 1 shot done, get J&amp;J. fine getting 2 shots, go pfizer. Yep, lot people bother getting unless walk get shot zero wait time. get middle May. latest CDC study (which recent occurred variants circulating) even differentiate 2 mRNA vaccines performance similar. Pfizer larger better PR (and partnership Israel, etc). Moderna effective, give second thought. first many early season, suspect. Vaccine efficacy symptoms isn’t 100%, shown fully effective hospitalizations death. cost-benefit doesn’t seem line up. Super Nintendo Land attendance shoot way second dose I'd lot less worried, 10 hours fine.

Millions old people take aspirin daily stop taking going get vaccine. got first dose, sooo fucking happy!!!!! April 1st. yeah, understanding flu shot expected dominant strain year union america.  People dying tens thousands. It’s humanitarian crises. Lmao, admit apologize comment low blow, good God. focused Hooked Phonics instead Six Sigma. don’t really desire need explain credentials internet stranger, appreciate inquiry. fucking record, 29 years old, happily married, home sits gorgeous acre extremely sought land, credit score 812 two days ago.

Education important tool life, whatever you’ve got make ends meet working towards completing it. Times especially difficult everyone, *especially* younger people, anyone balls condemn honestly jealous little baby wishes would opportunity. Go forth prosper. need deliver doses depending % doses already administered. Maybe get Alabama states poorly accelerate things. Bad headaches day really hoping it’s covid. Got vaccine week ago today don’t think I’m immune yet. idea headaches allergy caused worried covid? got vaccine wait crowded room 50+ people it’s possible got there. paid first lol seems like getting hung studies regarding efficacy. actual difference 60-70% 95% vaccine efficacy fairly minor, largely thing perfectly adequate intended job. goal vaccine prevents death hospitalisation, uptake high enough facilitate significant suppression virus, capable achieving this. Get first vaccine can. bother stressing minor details ultimately meaningless consequences. bet they'll offer one see ask other. messaging 10 years [**2031-04-01 18:25:50 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2031-04-01%2018:25:50%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide say vaccine ""works,"" we're actually talking two different related ways immune system defend pathogens.

The first fundamental result teaching immune system recognize pathogen foreign, immune cells rapidly mobilize defense it.

The second result builds top immunological training developing **neutralizing antibodies**... molecules float around bloodstream constantly bind pathogen prevent infecting cells all.

The former like trained military fight enemy case war starts. latter like trained military develop operate missile defense system take ICBMs enemy warplanes bomb cities.

While aspects defense strategy important, latter front-line defense prevents damage happening whatsoever. former mainline defense end war sooner minimize damage occur.

The vaccine wild type (original) covid virus engineered help body develop immunological training well neutralizing antibodies. thing is, neutralizing antibodies can't adapt new strains different, immune cells trained recognize covid can. new covid strain neturalizing antibodies longer bind still make vaccinated person sick, since immune system got head start recognizing original virus, able mount immune response days even weeks faster reduce amount damage that's done, leading much less severe bout illness.

So vaccine manufacturers what's essentially patch updates vaccine hopefully train patient's immune system develop new improved neutralizing antibodies front-line defense. I'm personally flu vaccines reality vaccination virtually got rid flu. 

Flu comes Asia. Six nine months later spreads rest world via travellers Asia. get vaccines get flu herd immunity strain period time. Next year, get new strain Asia repeat vaccination sickness. Repeat every year.

Even vaccines strain herd immunity, hundreds thousands people die flu every year. Typical flu season US kills tens thousands people, year hundreds.

Bringing back quarantines restrictions travel, especially Asia, popular hurts economy, that's probably it. Swede here, feel we're superior rest world. We're superior US like European countries Philadelphia fired refusing deflate covid numbers time DeSantos reopen. Sorry, I'm conspiracy theories that, think clear that's something DeSantos, well Abbott, McMaster, would problem means lose money. believe her. what? gonna get shot every year?? Fuck 69.420% 6/15 NH? Somewhere 140+ million vaccine shot. got mine yesterday, I’m ecstatic. arm still sore got blistering headache, worth it. !remind 10 years 

This new normal TORTLE. PLEASE RESPECT EXPERT OPINION FIELD. reddit circle jerk ignorant propaganda probably right -- states seem thorough job reporting Recoveries others much. Actives Deaths still high excited yet... uses exact mRNA sequence Pfizer. Anything hear one likely pretty similar other. thing happens reddit time. Posts back people want think frequently get upvoted posts people actually know something subject end downvoted. press gets choose shows papers, what's broadcasts, what's circulating website.

That's part first amendment said support death. Freedom Press. government forcing media company publish misinformation violation that.

Above said form right controlling flow information.

That truth. right media choose information allow flow ingrained 1st Amendment. That's part freedom press. can't tell publish much can't tell publish.

So talk spirit American values willing read part 1st Amendment.  Given expertise, identify variety turtle found?

Yes type studies conducted?

Scientific ones. Pre-prints only. know % effectiveness turtle combating watermelon yet?

Yes do.

Thanks asking questions. hope cleared everything up! mostly starting hit numbers people want get vaccinated need expand pool? 💎💉💎 there's little data period. animal studies. long term studies. study pregnant women getting vaccine....but manufacture wants force take it, no, dont think say protection stops 6 months. production ramped significantly, far outpacing initial estimates manufacturers found efficiencies development.

Additionally, they’re already studying freeze dried formulations help improve access poorer countries the... what? Good idea. affects whole world. Nope. one said ""only 6 months"". evidence trial says vaccine high efficacy *at* 6 months, evidence high efficacy SA variant. means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future. know long amount time passed. could year, could also 5 years, 10 years, indefinitely.

Bottom line: good news want get another shot. Amen brother here! Extremely lucky union, got paid sick time even tho covid. regular flu, couple days fever. sad 2020 believe made close $10k-15k it. states need work outreach. Ohio system sign online. 

The news interviewing 80 year old woman said ""I can't wait get vaccine, I'm waiting doctor call me"" understanding could gotten two weeks ago. 

Pharmacies create block hour two certain day walk ins people 75 requires online sign appointment. Asking sign online lot people. saw couple commercials regarding vaccine already. Oh haha sorry!
I read way :) Wife, works hospital, literally got written strep throat (positive test everything) take day get shot make sure didn’t spread it. 

In fucking hospital still got trouble calling sick never calls in. realize everyone vaccinated two months.... you’re describing impossible unless vaccine science wrong. anti-GMO quasi hippie crowd slowly turning right wing big time antivaxxers Something something private company. lol 'Merica. Thank saying this. crucial information. Huge jump delivery. 47 million doses behind administration what's delivered.

Purely anecdotal, county's numbers updated daily administration hourly sign-ups. MUCH closer administering everything we've received. feel like delivery numbers short delay administration much longer delay. totally understand point, we've pretty much told vaccine available everyone, we're going start opening back up. can't expect people suffer another 6 months year waiting data see long vaccine lasts. Again? Although could consider demand increasing eligibility groups open past months. Cool, come Kansas. Exactly. like we've lulled thinking yet another spike, ho hum. p1 variant resistant natural immunity, shown resistance even mRNA vaccines. 

We've assured case, Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J could easily tweak recipes within weeks combat new variants. Ok, interim (MONTHS development implementation), p1 variants 2x+ contagious far thought much deadlier younger age groups burn country, decide pandemic effectively over? Today, Maine reported first p1 variant asshole decided vacation sunny South America. Since testing 5% cases variants, I'm sure hundreds infected.

Fuck that. Ban travel Brazil country similar profile. Unfortunately suspect would viewed political risk. might way off, really hope am, quarantine outside threats FAR ""over"". Wow states absolutely horrible. end next week Alabama may drop 60% doses administered. 

That good. 

Other states really well good see. Got dose California yesterday. Took around 30 minutes signing online, waiting line, waiting 15 minutes afterwards. 

As far time investments go, petty efficient. FBI raided data analysis hacked (used username password longer authorized use fired) Covid database state Florida. reported it. first two paragraphs

“The ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine confirms protection remains high least six months second dose, companies said Thursday.

Protection likely lasts even longer that, vaccine experts say, say data showing good protection six months people vaccinated good news.” would hard. Czechia 40% population want vaccine Slovakia, like 55%. would difficult put infection control. last wave extremely potent deadly comparison October. March seems deadliest month Covid far region seems way out. Population limits lockdown seems partially effective. Intelligence mean can't fool willfully ignorant. Thinking smarter experts big among highly educated earning idiots. result b.1.1.7 becoming dominant think. scheduled sometime March seems gotten 91.3% 95% within margin error. understanding, nothing changed tell data provided 3 months 6 months. need ask serious question, I'm trying jerk, I'm really wondering. 

Why general mood community opening vaccine availability lines exactly opening community, removing mask mandates? vaccine takes 3 weeks final dose providing immunity, time frame normally month half.

The reason I'm genuinely concerned is, seems recipie disaster. average person might hear, ""no rules,"" go wild, like michigan right now. think it’s still effective 6 months. There’s another article words better risk/reward decision

I'd argue line thinking could lead self-centered way viewing vaccines. saying that's _you_ feel specifically, ""risk/reward"", ""cost/benefit"", etc. typically used situations like dealing money personal endeavors affects person making decision family, that's totally fine good. BUT... vaccines different. protect person receiving vaccine, often also protect many people person comes contact with, especially vulnerable people.

So... example: selfish, healthy, young person thinks themselves, ""risk"" taking covid vaccine might strong, uncomfortable reaction worst. ""reward"" would getting sick covid, may may worse getting infected actual covid. risk/reward equation seems kinda bad, maybe even favoring getting vaccine.

The above, I'd argue, course wrong way think it. risks, know, minimal small price pay immunity covid. rewards, **especially approached collective mindset**, immense: herd immunity covid preventing thousand thousands dying disease.

It simple decision make: get vaccine, actually part solution help save lives. personally won’t wear one it’s required establishment I’m entering requested someone I’m interacting with. don’t see point dick wear one Whole Foods whatever. I’m assuming flights standard minute. that’s compromise travel internationally see concert whatever I’d rather all. idea mine is, either eds real shitty genes lol. honestly think either cause never get fevers, even deathly sick kidney infections. I'm sure process slipping plenty inflammatory stuff, work. Like, immune cells see they're activated, send hella monocytes, stop monocytes exhaust instead anything else. That's know immune system honestly. Where's slip up?
I think OK long get awful feeling arm, hopefully. *heard* means working well, I'm doctor. sure hope pain translates efficiency though... Received 2nd dose yesterday, daughter. Husband fully vaccinated January. son received 1st dose far. Ironically, guy took credit Operation Warp Speed. think followers would want it. possibly still carry virus even vaccinated. COVID vaccine protects developing severe symptons/hospitalization/death. Unless dad also vaccinated, would careful possible. Yes. mRNA vaccines strong even 4-6 fold reduction neutralization variant concern, infection rare.

Moderna Biontech experimenting either booster spike E484 mutated spike booster. booster may even different formula, way boost titers decline time. need union. Heard PT student got vaccine caught week later.

Only mild symptoms, point vaccine instantly immunity. takes info shot arm hit rest body. Science: yet know vaccines prevent transmission.

Media: OMG still pass COVID even vaccine!!!

Science: vaccine protective least 6 months, data yet.

Media: OMG vaccine stops working/you need booster 6 months!!! popping nowhere really mention origins. could population undetected simply give opportunity flourish immunocompromised individual. That's proof immunocompromised individual trigger multiple mutations system mutations build one another within one individual, speeding process would take months general populace.

Nope. mutation happens. Prove wrong. Well does, much lot us thought, hell groups school aged children actually saw drops infection schools opened here. Novavax far refused sign contract EU, seems like want touch mess. J&amp;J’s vaccine isn’t traditional vaccine technology. It’s relatively new debuted previous Ebola outbreak. vaccine essentially exact thing mRNA vaccines: programs human cells produce corona spike protein. delivers payload different way. uses adenovirus transfer DNA cells. It’s like 2-stage delivery system versus mRNA vaccine like one-stage delivery system. Dude clearly don’t understand you’re talking about. Lab-acquired infections common also working S. pnuemoniae BSL-2 considered especially dangerous pathogen safety measures way less relaxed BSL3 4 know literal plagues happened throughout humanity despite humans immune system? recent history since humans discover ways supplement immunities things reduced occurrence? way comments won’t wasteland, choose interpret good news. That's cool. Still going get vaccine. Yep. Completely agree. Hopefully, mean space getting shot becoming immunized. 1) see irony pointing towards sub didn’t go down, find one did?

This like baring entry school building all, parents employees, students, right vaccination. April fools!!!! That’s officially I’m describing wearing mask moment on. “Raw dogging air”. poet genius. True trust CEO/ Thernos good job? pivoting enough Wow one time case report. also instance organism thought virulent weren’t using safety measures. remember reading article like week ago people shocked betrayed friends lied whatever qualify get vaccines. Really people jealous get even though jobs teachers, store workers etc risk friends got go bars again. 

It felt like weird article. Seriously couple months now, lot states open anyone 16/18+ ton old risk people vaccinated. really need vaccine around lot people something need ...qualifying condition... that's it. Many places even need anything check make sure appointment. Others require something like ID insurance card often turn away ID really could say insurance they'll still take you.

I got vaccine actually smoke qualifies me. could gotten least 2 months ago decided wait people needed could get it. point there's 150 million doses administered opinion longer wait get vaccine risk put especially others in. Well, things rapidly evolving study gave CDC director conclusion come out.

I'm gone three days everything goes nuts, reverts back normal?

Going update big comments post tomorrow. Mods delete inappropriate now, I've seen anything indicating different.

Definitely seen uptick bad-faith arguments thread today though.

EDIT: yesterday, bad. even spectacularly infamous incidents:  Lab acquired infections rare always documented. microbiology/immunology graduate student university BSL-3 lab someone infected working lab would huge deal. regulations go operating BSL3 BSL4 labs stringent, lab acquired infections common all. I'm *not eligible* another two weeks, demand pretty high (even now, appointments available within 60 miles live, that's without final wave eligible people jumping chance sign up).

But *me*. stay home longer. thing is, going quite people situation, lead bit unnecessary suffering death.

It'd really nice saved victory lap thing *actually* done. June July, I'm hearing. going back lockdown weekend Ontario. Hopefully get people vaccinated faster now. drove 1.5 hours. like anything exciting do. usually go drives I'm bored anyway. Yes, developing world mutated vaccination wasn’t taken far enough eradicate virus? know that’s case polio. It’s still Middle East countries vaccine campaign wasn’t allowed continue. PH govt top soon. 90% reduction possibility transmission

Couldn't say that? Feels like lied again, frustrating. There's much misinformation there, last thing need coming CDC. sort personal no? virus confusing. Roughly half US everything increasing half everything decreasing. think suggesting might safe (or even giving medical advice) much might get much protection someone immunocompromised. Obviously case protection still better none, still means run risk getting sick due anti-vaxer. vaccine available everyone mean everyone wants able get it. That's going take *months*. heard trials immuno compromised folks, doubting curious I’m Ohio. work dental office I’ve thankfully vaccine two months. boyfriend tested positive covid went two days positive negative. usually ALWAYS get sick he’s sick. guys know purpose immune system? Aaayyyyyyyv Well assume it’s new us honestly didn’t know vaccine would protect transmission. It’s better advise people cautious data make informed decision. I’m concluding Fauci anti-science, I’m concluding lying (which people fervently believe) message delivery major factor fueling anti-science movement Covid-19 research. that’s what’s truly understand CDC spreading message cases happening. missing bit nuance? statement ""Data Suggests Vaccinated Individuals Carry Virus Get Sick"" misleading? Quick sciency question: husband scheduled get Janssen J&amp;J Covid vaccine Friday morning. nearing 50yo 36.8 BMI. 

Now say Covid mutates like crazy 6 months / year, antibodies created thanks J&amp;J vaccine completely useless new variants.

Could potentially get new MRNa shot (Pfizer Moderna)?

My understanding MRNa technology would lot quicker adapt new mutations / variants “traditional” (J&amp;J) vaccines Dumb assed headline whats mortality rate people aged 60? mom tested positive health already great i'm worried rn im fucking scared I've noticed moderator site long time, auto-banning techniques, improperly used, like hitting everything sledgehammer.

I've freaking China, I'm long term relationship Chinese woman, speak conversational Chinese, well language learning good deal Chinese friends, I've looked ""social credit scores"" I'm telling social credit score real thing.

Check freaking profile - say plenty critical things CCP - I'm fan actions Hong Kong Xinjiang (and think recent posturing Taiwan annoying). call things see try dispel lot myths China, I'm one Americans actually first hand experience place. Good. courts spoken masks. We’re never going get anywhere near 100% vaccination. planet can’t even get it, likely another year two. it’ll mutated many many times. AZ J&amp;J also issues B117 variant, SA variant issues likely. also know COVID causes kids grow murderers. No, uh oh. It’s entirely fine. Source: UK mix vector vaccines mRNA vaccines, Israel predominantly mRNA. Flying traitors flag state gave us Grant Sherman.

Canada f*cked majority. Yeah, even close trying best mitigate car accidents. actually trying best, instead worrying MUH FREEDOMS, would lowering speed limit drastically, requiring helmets roll cages instituting fines unnecessary driving.

You’re Chicago.... wanna compare murder rates? AstraZenecian Johnsony enough guess. Boy cried wolf Wonder trust them. thing needs change headline. say vaccinated people can’t carry spread, it’s unlikely. course people testing positive vaccine, vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective. Unfortunately worded headline aside, outstanding news. Hopefully one I’m scheduled get tomorrow ok 🥴 Well, *know* safe turned be. take long time know. I'm gonna bother arguing clearly beyond changing mind, posting CCP-sympathizing material here. Barks County sounds Ruf Probably pretty safe comment bullshit lmao Well it’s length distribution, it’s wide spread initially. think it’s Newsom facing recall anything know happened, pretty MASSIVE Quality Control failure. Yikes.

Our government would well within rights hold back payment too. J&amp;J failed, fault. know people love hate way wanting say side wrong, positive. would like see turn message help hesitant group. mean silver lining didnt double went way side. glad person decided reconsider publicly announced change better. eligibility reason allow get vaccine relatively soon?  Wonder click bait editors reading this. mean really worried, get vaccine next weeks.

In something like 20+ states, everyone 16 eligible within next week.

You keep ignoring truths like see.  Firstly mad brown people got vaccines ""they themselves"" saying ""It's identity politics.""

You clearly concrete reason justify anger, shitty someone got something care why.

Once again, fucking sad. Netherlands better Germany American values support unregulated business activity? lol Wow thats long time.  good know. Unless you’re laissez-faire capitalist, believe support regulation. Well, leap. shouldn’t concern they’re vaccinated post makes glad American something entirely different. Someone buying car made UK UK sharing cars world.

If manufacturing plants Bangladesh instead EU, Bangladesh sharing vaccines world. get highly trained researches, studied free public school universities.

Which development, less manufacturing. it’s private companies this, without government would able do.

Something UK also heavily funded. noticed x country bring something nothing argument continue make assumptions thing knowleadge based feeling. Totally anecdotal, know guy vaccinated 2+ months ago he’s technician hospital. tested positive COVID passed girlfriend, whose brother dating. boyfriend also fully symptomatic. got tested waiting results.  FDA requires analysis 6 month data lol. isn’t grand scheme deceive people, they’re working booster need studying duration concurrently Nobody 100% safe, ever.

Except Michigan pretty much opened everything month ago, technically eliminating masks distancing, say distancing become way relaxed (can confirm, live SE Michigan). Coupled places lot busy now, maybe seasonality component, likely places longer closed plus stimulus shopping, etc. Well actually two made past animal test phase, way 3 phase double blind study confirming safety efficacy, granted authorization use FDA. don’t know think it’s relevant aren’t similar vaccines yet massive amount data approved ones There’s absolutely reason think UK variant makes less 1% cases South Africa. least I’ve seen zero reporting phenomenon.

Additionally, globally, UK variant competing SA variant least 2 1 cases. stand reason UK variant existence SA would automatically become dominant based worldwide trends. SA’s variant spreading become dominant within Sub Saharan Africa. 

Thankfully many people connected parts world even go Sub Saharan Africa. Doubly now. reason believe that, post vaccinated world, ostracizing countries like South Africa Zimbabwe global community travel bans quarantines immensely help stop spread variants. Also, mRNA vaccines use much 1st world effective variant currently circulating Africa. soft bans movement African countries effective vaccines, think current SA variant less scary predicted.

Thank hint, found press release study: fucking not. majority people vaccinated, surge easily happen.

Hope they're susceptible viru... soon. reason think different- Pfizer around longer kills PR game. savage could trust say apparently don’t understand word ‘anecdote’ means?

You personify Dunning Kruger. flu, vaccines make mostly based educated guesses predominant subtypes lineages combine one vaccine. mRNA platform, imagine they’ll get better flu vaccines too. also sars-cov-2, LOT sequencing going on, better idea vaccine. 

With flu, (to knowledge) reason vaccines aren’t effective usually there’s either different subtype wildly different variant important mutations (sometimes genetic drift shift) make immune response vaccine less effective (since they’re accurate specific flu might end circulating). Like, example, one year got trivalent flu vaccine (2 Flu subtypes, 1 flu B lineage) ended getting Flu B — wasn’t even vaccinated strain, probably. maybe Flu B vaccinated against, conferred many important mutations didn’t matter, couldn’t stop virus replicating cells. 

Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2, pfizer determined vaccine (as far I’ve read) equally effective South African variant, we’re year since start thing. likely, variants aren’t super meaningful way flu, since hasn’t mutated way makes vaccines ineffective. good reason might haven’t established common animal massive reservoir way flu. 

With flu, virus go back animals (say birds; like chickens example) recombine, giving significantly genetic diversity goes infect next host — plus lot access human population (also countries surveil poultry farms, assume US does, know Asia there). it’s likely sars-cov-2 started bats, haven’t seen masses animals infected reservoirs sars-cov-2, also reduces chance we’re going end vaccine evading variant, less people interact bats say, farm animals. 

Okay stop lol, love stuff know risks benefits though, find own. can't depend word others memetics means, especially fall within circle idealism. saying everyone needs stop throwing word ""science"" around actually practice epistemological ideas behind ""science"". haha yeah teachers parents schoolchildren told ""safe"" reopen despite unvaccinated people working essential jobs sure dipshits 70% 65+ population received shot week ago. average 2.5 million shots per day since then, gone up.

Opportunity create immunity. Shots arms we've got way many adults refusing it. depends. case factor capitalistic opportunism.

Immune system memory Covid antibodies appeared last long natural infections. made vaccine development tricky also people re-caught Covid.

So may need booster shots, especially newer variants Covid pop like said.

Ah typical god complex holier thou coward. surprised jumped conclusion believe morally superior literally everybody.

Also hope raise kid balanced rational human being, else he'll f\*\*\*ing nightmare like you. Honestly, never asked long vaccine would last impression would lot longer. 

I'm fearful never reach herd immunity many people never get vaccine. reach herd immunity vaccine starts fade people took first? 

I feel like wishful thinking we'll ever get enough population take vaccine reach herd immunity. Yeah, might mean whiny participants one group versus another. folks take getting man cold seriously others.

P.s. Reddit, don’t forget live life. Enjoy smell fresh air. Smile friends family. Laugh little. Life’s short serious time. Balance important. realize you’re downvoted right? call 90+ percent, even variants like SA, moderate? Michigan 5000 daily infections. peak December-February Michigan 7000 daily infections. low Michigan 1000 daily infections (February) illustrates steep growth. Hospitalizations rising quickly now, almost halfway point last peak. Deaths up, rate. still expect change next week. Largely same, slightly worse picture yesterday.

PA &amp; NJ next interesting places viral spread. PA front end exponential (logrithmic prefer) growth cases. clear pattern. would expect start rising hospitalizations deaths. NJ already many infections NY similar. Given nj, philly nyc highly coupled, makes sense. course Chicago going DEAD LAST nation opening shots 16+...while Lori Lightfoot scolds residents north side specifically excluded accessing vaccine mass vaccination sites bad boys girls. astrazeneca dirt New data showing Pfizer still ninety percent effective six months SA variant. **THIS**

Holy shit misinformation spreads quick. variability Memory Cells wild, really can't draw conclusions point. you’re extremely dense, i’m going bother anymore. 

you realize nurses HEALTHY order treat others, otherwise get sick it’ll nothing? 

again, reddit, home ignorant. Danke Spahn.

But since 60 germany get likely Biontech. I'd concerned long term effects really know yet. Kids example issue. I'm ok taking one age kids concerned..what effects way issues kids later time? Developments long term effects. So, going post comment every single thread Europe? true, someone eligible doesn’t mean they’ve vaccinated developed immunity.

Only 50% over-75s vaccinated, groups less that.  like Texas - lack restrictions person full time schooling causing surge... /s Luckily new data showing it’s still 90+ percent effective six months on. I’m fine yearly whatever booster. biggest issue supply countries stopping anti vaccine propaganda getting enough people take it. What?? doesn’t last forever? They're clarify J&amp;J doses currently circulation administered affected mishap. doses never left factory. Covid continue circulate animal populations. I'm optimistic general, wanted point reason might need booster shots later. already happening? Merck manufacturing J&amp;J, Sanofi assisting Pfizer/BioNtech SII manufacturing AZ submit questions Twiv? Especially Dr.Griffin. That’s I’m responding to... they’re saying it’s “well known” experts. shouldn’t presented shiny new discovery media, what’s happening. points I’ve made still stand. can’t tell you’re trolling point seriously aren’t understanding I’m saying. eat Kimchi time, fine. help allergy pollen? good six months because

It's good LEAST 6 months. ""Only"". read qualifier ""at least.""

Again, folks read past six months. Pfizer required make statement today? pressed release trial results saying long lasts? something could waited? right causing slight panic. could predicted loosening restrictions letting kids go back person schooling enough vaccines took hold would fueled outbreaks??? determined come million reasons get shot, guess nothing say. 🤷‍♀️

PS. know prevents transmission, get shot. think maybe it’s nurses think since they’re “medial industry”, know actual science? That’s think assume could point. else anti-vax big thing among nurses? Nurses aren’t role models. job isn’t example good health others, it’s literally treat people. logic overweight people prohibited nurses well, even they’re fully capable performing jobs. downvotes literally meaningless impact life whatsoever, wouldn’t lose sleep it. don’t think anyone comments mentioned countries starting get first vaccines don’t expect enough doses majority population 2022 later... aren’t real Sticky post turn submissions. hard, takes 30 seconds. 

How hell people think they're good mods beyond me. Memorial Day US gonna absolutely LIT work after, arm sore might feel fatigued. that’s it. assume Moderna’s vaccine would results? Bugs data Pfizer got Moderna shot. recent COVID seroprevalence studies US? I'm aware Red Cross study 21%, CDC estimate actual infections =\~4x confirmed. Red Cross study might group takes precautions, CDC estimate may bit dated. curious anything recent. vaccination numbers rising, point we'll see herd effects curious reliable estimate prior infection. understand science behind vaccines? explain detail science understand?

I already got it, tired people reddit claiming scientists never read scientific study entire lives, ignored research methodology possible interest biases may include. truth can, think supposed might make unvaccinated people let guard too. Yep misread going back still don’t know bringing safety doses produced NL human error made US factory. 

It also morning coffee :( fair, Curevac another mRna vaccine plagued delays. Bhag bc alajazeera. preponderance evidence shows children 10 years younger, study Tönshoff et less likely acquire SARS-CoV-2 less likely transmit 

The linked study preprint peer-reviewed, examines small sample size low prevalence area, directly flies face 50 studies showing opposite. might correct, throw preponderance evidence single study shows want show. Yes.

This overwhelming majority people get flu cough, sniffles fever days get healthy.

Think populations exposed influenza first time novel (I.e., Native American populations). wasn’t great. Now? get stuffy nose eat chicken soup. dont know Europe followed USA. here: 1st march 2020. 2nd later summer (4th july parties vacations). 3rd xmas/into jan-feb. 4th would now. Lol, vitriolic comment acknowledge I’m correct point single health care provider still scheduling everyone right second?

I didn’t comment availability appointments, commented fact everyone eligible. I’m, example, Seattle announced everyone eligible April 15th, point.

Either way, hope you’re eligible get vaccine soon cut anxiety stop lashing internet strangers! 😀 There’s probably bump vaccinations everything don’t think wave big last ones. Yes, would reasonable. then. 

We also keep mind still bunch assholes refuse vaccinated, continue put others risk. people simply can't vaccinated medical reasons, important everyone get vaccinated, so. protects can't. kind insane person went selectively edited words study makes point viral loads might comparable.

Also completely insane think study anything study linked OP, also directly contradicts least 50 peer-reviewed studies showing children either less susceptible similarly susceptible.

We wait scientific community works details. Linking (frankly, poorly done) studies seroprevalence low prevalence areas early pandemic confirm biases way go making point. See happening India. past people also suffered whole fucking ton? People crazy wanting kids suffer less historical norm. claim lockdown worked pat back. deserved better damn well quality control place!

It is. *Every* single batch biologic rigorously tested manufacturer (the exact tests run, parameters acceptable results, part biologics approval process). manufacturer thinks biologics good, test results samples sent FDA's Center Biologics Evaluation Research. test results reviewed samples possibly independently tested FDA gives permission batch released market. (And FDA particularly interested checking new biologics headed market.)

I absolutely guarantee mistake discovered manufacturer even tried submit test results samples FDA manufacturers *really* like submitting even potentially questionable batches approval, much less ones egregiously wrong batches were. know. put words mouth. I'm frustrated seems like sub gets hard dragging long possible. depressing. WA state revealed 102 instances vaccinated people later contracted virus.  What’s masks big deal? don’t get main problem anyone 16 can't get vaccinated. Households young children interact still promote infection.

How tables turned. Last week ""selfish"" US ""hoarding"" vaccines.

Given current lack approval AZ seemingly good supply (except J&amp;J fiasco today) probably bad idea offload AZ batches US expire unused. Enjoy voluntary limitation didn’t say anything that. said vulnerable people aren’t 100% safe vaccinated. believe J&amp;J vaccine specifically developed reach underdeveloped regions world. IIRC, trials even conducted Africa. It’s easiest vaccine distribute single-dose insane temperature restrictions. mean buying fear narrative. difference rational virus, taking COVID threat insane level. one us could die time anything. almost died blood clot leg 2018. me, means taking one day granted, living fully can. lot people Russia distrust government, trust Putin personally. know, make sense, centuries old tradition ""good tsar bad boyars"". 99.9% sure accurate. Phase 3 (again) needed approval booster. 
 
I know govt hoped Moderna could lower dose shots (it's 3x large Pfizers seemingly w/o benefit post shot side-effects), perhaps they're running larger trials test (and combos ori-vax + booster, booster, etc). Reading [**Emergent Biosolutions Glassdoor interesting. hide face I’m rolling nuts. Depends time scale. first sentence new cases going (which compared last month) vaccines going (demonstrably correct timescale). Seems you’re ignoring good news rest article arbitrary metrics don’t coincide phrase it. Glad everyone swimming vaccines people literally arent dying thousands day! AZ fine, job like vaccines approved. Maybe export vaccines US..oh wait...   Honestly, reason people chastised “different opinions” majority medical community, giving folks validation like validating flat-earthers. Sure, right believe whatever heck want believe, doesn’t make scientific fact. past year, we’ve watched confidence scientific community take huge nose dive, really can’t blame feeling personally attacked upon suggestions shouldn’t hurt feelings discount opinions laypersons. Let’s forget majority deniers cannot back arguments without facebook posts YouTube videos. mean, even pay scientists we’re going normalize tiptoeing around feelings granola moms vaccinations? course, I’m speaking particular, I’m giving reason much pushback “everyone different opinion attacked”. 

FWIW, completely agree people absolutely right choose put body. That’s fundamental human right. choose career healthcare, sacrifices make sometimes. employer deems requirement vaccinated, opinions get override that. Nobody bats eye requirement Hep B vaccine, vaccine developed 10 years mRNA vaccines were. covid vaccines cleaner ingredient list McDonald’s hamburger. Getting vaccine poses risk vaccine. 

Again, really mean disrespect. I’m tired whole, “these days people hate anyone different opinion” argument. No, fraud legal. however selective research. lying findings, sharing everything pertinent either. market influenced research follows model.

It naive deny presence predatory opportunism.

Unlike rest you, alleging anything. questioning allegations. condition EUA study issue more, something specific already know would argue getting different vaccines close together?

Combo shots thing, flu shot year actually guards multiple strains/variants, one type flu virus, plus TDAP MMR commonly-used combo vaccines entirely different types diseases. Guess pro getting cancer. Good luck that. really question more...

Troll fucking idiot Nature didn’t owe us virus could vaccinate well got unbelievably lucky.

I think lucky - scientists studying SARS virus' since early 00's outbreak Asia. We've basically gotten lucky insofar already 50% work done making vaccine SARs virus. ...... 1960s India vaccinated lower percentage population European country, this. 

This would line EU's stance vaccine exports. There's like predictable pattern decay follow vaccine efficacy? know virology. really come waiting seeing long last? Good you, damn must feel shitty people vaccinated yet Right, same, ethical imperative. don’t think feel like need continue sharing level antibody test results. pipe, 5 5 immune system recognizes antigen vector delivers it, immune response becomes specific powerfull subsequent expositions. Fantastic point, reason variants first place. point clarified animals like poultry able get lots flu viruses cannot infect humans. viruses genetically share information that's variants concerning. 

Within humans, scary subtypes/strains coronaviruses us constantly circulating (like way highly pathogenic avian influenza, example, circulate birds). probability lower would end something way we're dealing currently. could definitely still happen, chances worse something like flu reservoirs massive genetic diversity viruses have. 

Also fair, learned fall taking virology course school / I'm expert means unblinded early February received cdc card. sounds logical, except people Covid get one mRNA vaccines generally worse side effects first dose, fewer none second shot. hard know booster would look like trial data published. chance hell Well cigarettes illegal long time ago. get point. know everything subject matter? methodology use reach level knowledge? Gotta honest, hoping good April Fools joke thread. Binding referendums law UK can’t remember NPR program story encourage look up. Medical articles take months get published working on. Again, one stating 100% happening wild, they’re stating highly probable risk needs addressed monitored order combat Covid globally.  People America stand another 2020 type lock down. national state level. city outbreak see it. local college installed lock break. People smart maintain sense self protection awareness. Summer coming outside safer close contact others. wear mask protection. Hell yes, Dandan0005 prez Yeah. also none speak of. low-key hoping feel half-dead day could least know ""working."" even better think. September 27, 2020 March 20, 2021, we've 1,854 lab confirmed cases (1,639 clinical labs, 215 public health labs) flu US. Last year roughly time period (9/29 - 3/21), 284,840 lab confirmed cases (242,330 clinical, 42,510 public health). years numbers 0.65% last years numbers.

Or mind-blowing comparison... We've number hospitalizations far year pediatric DEATHS last year.

Sure, anecdotal evidence, enough plan use mask next winter.

[Source last years numbers 
[Current \* updated regularly though, numbers ""Week 11"" living free country servant master employer confirm, I’m also trial got blood drawn last week. don’t tell us whether antibodies though, guess it’s double blind.  Let's honest, everyone would rather Magneto Wolverine, Venom WAY cooler Spiderman. heard internet get one immortal

Or grow third arm ass

I can't remember every 10 years...am 30...ive ever vaccine once, need booster?! alleging committed research fraud, evidence ""capitalism."" pretty strictly enforced months ago. National guard airport, taking names location everyone arriving, they'd random in-person checks make sure people breaking quarantine.

This seems died last month half though. U rite, bro Wtf. right middle performance cases deaths per capita (despite one oldest populations) we've plateau weeks hospitalizations continue decline. there's reason nurse instead doctor  12 week lockdown now. It’s shows equal efficacy hospitalisation anyway won’t bother arguing point. really see little point keep using AZ long term least definite better options  Virus don’t work way living beings do. You’re close understanding risk here. Immunocompromised people essentially vector creating multi-mutation variant would typically take months created general population (months, years).

Maybe you’re basing claims understanding living beings work. Viruses aren’t same. already happening. article pretty pointless. vaccines mean lockdown lifted without massive death spike. That's matters many weeks safest see significant tested positive? Like many days day got symptoms? militant arrogance impressive. long doesn’t turn humans supervillains. 

However, supervillains often *do* better costumes gadgets. unusual unreasonable really, totally logical beings. totally honest, got little twinge fear right shot too, like little voice going ""what something bad happens"". went away soon talked nurse going administer shot.

You'll fine, try enjoy experience, remember details tell young uns decades. participating huge shared experience good chunk humanity, pretty cool. hahaha 

slow steady race COVID19 cry well, really hate needles. maybe see child-free people agreeing wear masks public kids vaccinated don’t see large number people staying home/social distancing protect people’s kids. saw post day asshole acquaintance posting getting vaccine void life insurance. Many people reacting knew stay away evil vaccine. levelheaded person posted proof it’s true. People piled level headed person talking believing stuff read internet. don’t trust it. whiplash. hurt. great info, thank Reddit Facebook nutshell. Okay—I don’t understand you’re trying refute. said wasn’t good hospitalized actually far worst time hospitalized given availability beds treatment literally second sentence first comment you. Admittedly, organization hoping quick brush off. got agitated felt like listening saying (It feel like listening now) job understand there's compelling force discussion stranger internet. Thank well wishes, hope happy healthy year. know risks benefits though, find own.

I can't depend word others memetics means, especially fall within circle idealism.

I actually practice epistemological ideas behind ""science"".

I do, personally professionally.

Unless live ideals, probably keep doubt-casting yourself. friends STEM, make $200-250k spouting Covid vaccine nonsense Facebook. disappointed. wish Facebook would ban accounts. Smart. Sounds like Mom eating soup. chews loud even soft things. tell conservative antivaxx republicant without telling arent con antivax republicant lol That’s point NZ though, doesn’t need rush - unfortunately need to. problem knows mix vaccines, sure still need wait results come AZ basically second class citizens. 

In opinion UK dump AZ donate COVAX done priority groups use mRNA/Novavax vaccines complete rest population. Giving (especially young) people AZ long run actually detrimental vaccine uptake get told oh need take another booster now, people give it. Oh no, scary toxins ooooo

Bye troll! Oh stop, know chip implanted swab nose *laughs Canadian* Power Points made. Yes, quite possible. Welcome new normal. Schools opened 3 weeks ago, priority. people meet groups outside retail + outdoor hospitality resumes 12th April. Brazil petri dish vaccine resistant strains.

The world honestly needs something it. going end fucking us. comment something confidence qualified especially given amongst actual doctors? wrong Reddit. It’s worded “at least 6 months” vaxxed 6 months. could run test say last 1 year hasn’t year yet? Downvote Train come down! get vaccine, get vaccine, EVERYONE gets vaccine! family Europe 70 getting vaccine yet. Grateful every day live US. nothing refusing accept science. even full fda authorization. science complete. wanna argue gaslighting. understand people's skepticism. also refused moderna pfizer shot. 

Whatever takes get people vaccinated. people want moderna/pfizer help get j j. Fighting get anywhere. true misinformation. ingredient vaccine, vaccine itself. vaccines going trash.

You really edit comment. That's thing. makes feel hypocritical worried slim hance adverse reaction shot worried potentially contracting virus killed people. 

I'm aware fact irony comes along it. Considering never mentioned ""overwhelmed,"" article?? OK. 

 mentions real exhaustion.

from Adnan Munkarah, chief clinical officer Henry Ford Health System, said coronavirus patients surviving disease 2020, part skewing younger.  frustrated, said, staff exhausted. “We hoping now, would things better control,” said.** That's crazy. Illinois similar population we're cases/day. exciting! confirmed biased, means correct. arrow. Easy? clearly never nursing school.  

Lots days off? Christmas kid's birthday. called work days off.

STFU nonsense. really is. Employers would replace dead, Covid-ridden bodies they’d pay days taken get vaccinated. Can’t risk sweet sweet profit. people there? criticize them? YAY!!!! Call doctor see white spots. Florida seen uptick cases recently never getting case count way states did. Florida far fine... state it’s one hardest hit country historically currently. understand headlines like take data specific area start applying national scale.

It doesn't. 

From article: country study contrasts. New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, states Northeast continue report high levels cases, troubling upticks emerged Illinois, Minnesota Midwestern states. much South West, case numbers remain relatively low. cure right front us along Yeah terrible say thank bringing clarity here. Thank you.  Well I'm glad believe everything government agencies tell government never lied thought twice experimenting humans letting cancerous toxins major part food supply... Bahahahaa thats awesome.

Consider date, expecting Rick Roll knew super fortunate damn. thought able get COVID vaccine employer might punish getting sick really one can’t grasp. That’s horrible.

So I’ll say again. get better opportunity, leave. employers good benefits. Infections still important try squash allows variants could escape immunity. really need shoot foot right finish line! stupid. Even realize full capacity. We're top 10 vaccine distribution, hospitalizations flat, cases nowhere near back December-January, run office year.

I'm skeptical we're headed another lockdown. United States say that. clearly stated people know unvaccinated time. 

What saying Covid, even asymptomatic Covid, cause dangerous long term side effects. new information. proven vaccinated people safe post Covid heart attacks/strokes organ damage. assume much less likely, able prove yet. know safe initial infection. 

(To fully transparent, one study showed vaxxed people still hospitalized two died, million believe. would consider ""safe"".) figure make dicks stay hard longer

did know mistake? Pfizer wasnt making hard dick meds thats got lol fact phase 3 trials never complete Holy shit, county sent text yesterday saying eligible open appointments. got one scheduled tomorrow afternoon!

I'm 23 asthma. thought I'd wait least another month even got appointment.

Beyond stoked summer considering people county around age vaccinated then! wouldn’t able whine reddit. Meanwhile Mets Nats already postponed due covid. wonder going workout. No, contraindications ingredients specific vaccine. unaware overlapping ingredients JNJ Pfizer vaccines, example. thing generic vaccine allergy

Generic ""severe allergies"" listed contraindication. I've seen multiple people severe allergies vaccinated. specific guidance enhanced monitoring them.

It's asked intake monitoring time increased 30 minutes specific observation. think it’s ridiculous take sick time someone sick? Yikes, definitely part problem. people taking things extreme understandable. virus cause global pandemic time kicking ass right getting closer ""normal"".

If fully vaccinated, feel ease going things. think problem would vaccinated people going without mask people knowing person vaccinated cause panic. This. everyone saying July 4th. Memorial Day day. It’s still early vaccination process let anyone let guard though. think gonna leave guidelines way till least July (start Q3). know, right? already considering mask use 2019-2020 cold &amp; flu season tired even one cold would normally get year. pandemic hit okay masking started getting recommended. I'm definitely going next winter beyond.

I think 2022-2023 season best comparison. point, far enough current pandemic people start deciding ""maybe masks pointless"" stop using them.

As vilifying mask usage, I've long suspected comes selfish desires comfort. Masks worn long term comfortable mask. people concerned comfort safety safety others. those, want make feel better decision insulting others (lift oneself pushing others down). also willing somewhat ""loud"" start running peer pressure. Kind sucks, really. UK's figures flawed, EU's claims many sent UK are. EU claimed exported 21m vaccines UK, time would 2/3rd administered vaccines, know many come native AZ production plants NHS upload daily administered counts well weekly(ish) proportions vaccine which. time order 21m correct would entire Pfizer administered (yes), plus 7m Pfizer sat storage (erm... Unlikely, figures reserve amounts) another 4 unknown AZ doses. 4m number familiar that's EU first tantrum triggered investigation EU AZ plants. turned 4m made UK sent EU back bottling, EU initially claimed produced there. Well young person Ireland, absolutely idea I'll vaccinated. minister said Dáil last week everyone September yesterday changed mid-July one seemed notice. lot difficult considering flu vaccines don’t require -70C storage. Doable though  ripping dipshit population

to fair many people want vaccine appointment easy getting one. This. There's light end tunnel, we're moving steadily towards it, we're still tunnel. understand companies employers unforgiving draconian also aware also know try/ best support need vaccine periods time off, related testing/ possible exposure virus well. RemindMe! 3 months Gaslit whole ""America best"" trope. Also anecdotally, covid march 2020, symptomatic 7 weeks. 1 month symptoms went away antibody test negative. mention potential false negative time well inclusion study needed positive result, retest. see variant escapes immunity vaccinated hosts, adapt antigen tests catch (or work), could become critical tool.

But we'd actually use it. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let’s go! Lol really ripping Vaccine-as-a-subscription

Sigh. exactly it. Every day evidence comes money time pass vaccine (and probably J&amp;J) invest Pfizer/Moderna

Stop spreading anti-vax rubbish. strategy cost thousands lives insane. vaccines' efficacy dented variants - think Moderna started trials altered vaccine?

New Zealand dreadful comparison given vast majority world small isolated island. vaccines approved countries similar job - look real world data UK using AZ Pfizer - little difference. Okay. Data based trail participants. got shots last summer. everyone close contact others work people professional jobs work home need to. think ridiculous take entire week work regard. mean? Pfizer/Moderna appear likely much better long term options - there’s little equality here. Even 1 dose AZ bit better even say equally effective - it’s proven Pfizer/Moderna better next threat variants. vaccine British doesn’t mean need defend death empirical evidence, shocks much see British members sub Oli mean never learned never took ap bio took ap chemistry instead went electrical engineer  Reddit practically buzzfeed anyway especially big subs US export ban. EU, understandably, built production EU. started really late compared US/UK smaller initial investment means production ramp quickly. CDC guidelines this. Lessening symptoms, 10 days symptom onset, fever 24 48 hours without medication. forget 3rd one, info readily accessible. actually norm country minority company. get $100 bonus getting shot get paid time get it. America. Dumb video W€ll that’$ conv£ni£nt I'm saying ""98% survive"" idiotic talking point 98% even remotely mean ""almost everybody."" unnecessary, seemingly, article something added February. changed February require EU change handle customs???

there getting shots arms production, i.e. logistics. extra paperwork delays shot arm even one day, many extra covid cases that? many extra deaths? really purpose behind EU justify it? Land fee, home slave. Ya I’m doubting that’s it’s phase 3 trial. know sure FDA regulatory agencies requiring Phase 3 data booster approval, might amendment ongoing phase 3 trial gather data too. *Insert Kermit Frog sipping tea meme here* family encouraging conspiracies. That's honestly mentality. know bit different deadly disease going around im vaccinated I'm going scared get hands dirty. hope Texas isn’t busy burning bodies result Lots stories reek persecution complexes. There’s always somebody else blame. that’s completely different situation. Wow. I’ll let aunt know needed “grit!” apparently wuss vomiting 103+ fever week. Pretty sure current recommendation adults every 10 years. Check doc! reality Americans. one week, suuuuuuuure Maybe live bubble US, take time anytime want appointments. It’s like past 25 years career. That's shitty thing say, everyone wants doctor. Nursing separate important profession. Wtf @ concept sick days. sick Germany, sick anymore, even takes months.

Obviously fully paid, wants sick worry job finances. That's basically opposite freedom. sound hear millions COVID scolds busybodies setting stopwatches start accusing people murder literally six months data time frame comment on. three months, able confirm provides protection nine months not. necessarily major concern right now, imagine individuals vaccinated AZ need second round shots soon everyone else finished there's enough mRNA doses available.

Depends variants country mRNA vaccines' efficacy dented variants vaccines (maybe Chinese inactivated ones less so). Hence Moderna already altering vaccine new trials.  Isn’t research helpful given dosing UK twelve weeks?  Yeah, work large nursing home receive shots hardly anybody got side effects severe enough keep home. we’re we’re bunch wuss. grit push mild uncomfortable feelings. Finally side effects first dose. Negative honest you, piece info headlines coming weeks drive vaccinations. 10 days bosses doctor told COVID. downvote two days mad someone added color BuReAuCrAcY statement? Totally agree, I'm sure part message said infections focus. 

My main point we're today infections - something happens time - infections resulting severe illness death. goal go back infections - inevitable result open society - resulting acceptable amount illness death. infections simply unobtainable virus high asymptomatic transmission rate. point dozens responses tweet made assumption. Sure could respond every one time to, motivation Virginia opening eligibility April 19 roommate brags 16-hour days. Congratulations, man. exploited employer profiting pride. ""stay grind"" ""keep hustling"" mentality like propaganda. Yup great news, got scheduled Pfizer 17th month. great try better. 

Bad news J&amp;J fuckup. Probably slow things USA much certainly good news. I’m pretty sure even capitalistic society America, people easily able get time off, take necessary sick days regards getting COVID-19 vaccine lingering side effects receiving said shot. part Pfizer’s Phase 3 trial received vaccine September. yes, absolutely mathematican. Based number tests full hospitals. also look excess deaths reported December. government lie numbers government numbers. investigated earlier pandemic, one paper included kinds fermented cabbage saeurkraut.  high risk people received first shot far longer two weeks ago, issues providing second shot scheduled. know point is.

Anyone 65+ gotten shot yet, want shot. live US get 28 days year PTO ever use. also great health dental insurance $50 deductible. work doesn’t make employees use PTO covid.  know of. think school thought Brazilian South African variants fairly similar though. system fucked everything US expensive general, health care particular overpriced due insurance system. 

Nothing short tearing starting scratch gonna fix it, I’m afraid that’s happening time soon. many rich people married system, Republicans argue bad faith. Maybe could explain them? I'm sure could find way helpfully inform break down. everyone level comprehension. Good luck getting significant compliance another lockdown. makes sense. However, know articles saying J&amp;J met 20M target March delivery allocation numbers CDC reflect them? UK figures flawed(according you) put question marks EU figures? Everyone knows USA garbage. Except Americans. kind false equivalency really decaying ability well-placed institutional trust. Yes, ""the government"" lies. quote ""the government"" singular authority; there's millions people employed involved across span innumerable agencies various disciplines. branch military arm withheld information experiments, mean CDC equally corrupted engages identical practices. Yes, FDA received funds ""big agriculture"" allowed food quality decline areas, mean entire institution needs absolved much needed regulatory practices around things consume use daily basis without thinking twice ""the government"" ensured safety. think bigger problem doses, really way get more. protection 10 days people, rising 80 percent 14 days. I’d guess latter, I’m expert. recently learned Pfizer’s tests tell difference two types antibodies, labs potentially same. Going 48 hours nausea loss appetite Pfizer Shot1. Probably take PTO Shot2 rate. got first dose noon able workout 5:00pm soreness. really set later night, really sore two days. got first one morning. thought slightly odd taste mouth, otherwise nothing else odd. Injection sight little sore. 

Does someone link sub discusses vaccine experiences? I'd love nickel every time scientist made measured, scientifically accurate statement. I'd poor man waiting redditors same. could done that, true. point elements supply chain collapse.

We've gone quite tangent I'm going reiterate first point. EU share vaccines them.  know what's funny? bet millions anti vaxers think nothing spending fifty bucks powerball gets hundreds millions odds winning laughable! oh hell naws want roll dice life saving vaccine way way way better odds good outcome! I’ve seen studies indicate small antibody level benefit 3x dosage. doesn’t provide extra initial protection, looks like might give slightly higher ceiling fall comes variants (and maybe waning antibody counts too). said, Pfizer there’s nothing definitive know of, throwing one possible (likely relatively minor) benefit. agree regardless, halving makes lot sense explore. Notably, various stages localized lockdown swine flu nowhere near 60k dead. lol fuck even THINK this! Since early January, 2020, closely followed corona story. things claimed:

- human-to-human transmission

- like influenza

- lockdowns work

- asymptomatic transmission

- washing hands enough

- masks useless even dangerous

- transmission aerosols insignificant

- virus mutate

- mutates become less dangerous

- children transmit virus

- mutations evade vaccines ...

Always lack scientific evidence prove contrary cited excuse inaction. 

Anybody warning danger denigrated alarmist. 

In end, action always taken late. virus contagious one proactive approach needed reactive approach. Failure act early imposes heavy price later, human lives economic cost.

If house fire commission study find house burn calling fire brigade. 

Some things denied, like usefulness mask wearing, common sense. obviously concerned revelation easiest get Moderna idea difference time.

This thread contains comments hypothesizing lack CD8 cells Moderna's results error subsequent studies seem bolster confidence Moderna cell response: People getting sick private gatherings, usually ones 15-20 people. getting sick spending stimulus even eating restaurants. care minorities Europe western countries. relying state roll back temporary powers something advise upon Fock 😑😭😭 people forced go work they’re feeling well... could go wrong pandemic? Sure them. still moral right prevent exports protect citizens. ban companies exporting weapons countries conflict with.

I think prevent AZ exports. Let others use it. cancel contracts possible continue suppliers hitting targets. lack hospital care, resources. It’ll last long they’re catastrophically overwhelmed, yes, eventually return normal out-of-control spread mitigated. said nurses trained diagnoses illnesses want trained make medical decisions, get schooling become nurse practitioner. part agree with? Thank  try mixing oil VW emissions data models, stuff like magic. agree pharmacies that. exact comments exactly think eventually close 90% seniors. Well considering batch 15 million doses, can’t something start every day. Hopefully late process. 1 dose shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; right people peaceably assemble, petition Government redress grievances.

That's bitching about. Congress involved here.

So who's ""American Values"" talking here, clearly ones set forth Constitution.  say 65+ done one dose two? can't believe year pandemic still need explain people Yeah unless you’re shitting America you’re going popular non-scientist, let perfectly clear saying condescending jerk. Vermont opened vaccine registration BIPOC today. able get 18 year old registered weeks would eligible. definitely understand India refuses, time understandable EU attempts get doses well organization said rich countries share vaccines poor countries?
Although EU 71.000.000 doses said UK US shared ZERO doses? Maybe talk lawyer specializes employment law? Sounds like case, especially writing spoke HR told ok. mess. Sorry deal real. Mine even setting clinics give vaccinations Econ 101: free lunch. Yep, literally commented moment ago another thread. Cautious vaxers well may want vaccine badly, confidence things getting swept rug overlooked due heavy political financial pressure get vaccine many people possible quickly possible, global scale, nonetheless.

just look issue Johnson &amp; Johnson manufacturing messed ingredients 15 million doses. Thankfully caught put arms.

I think campaigning great thing, help provide confidence people bugs worked getting worked out.  Plenty epidemiologists talking cells Memory B cells, they’re inferring protection lasts long time based response provoked cells vaccines ""tHiRd wOrLd cOuNtrY gUcCi bElt"" Visit real third-world country babies. Yes problems need fix, shows touch folks are. Harris lot younger Biden. Older male actually dependent Tcell immunity younger ppl old people harder time eliciting antibodies Tcells arent affected. However, wasnt using one point, couldve coincidence Talk tour doctor and/or pharmacist giving shot Reddit randoms.

That's long study's going far. *""Protection likely lasts even longer that, vaccine experts say""*, can't prove yet six months since people got second doses study. lot immediate bleeding got Pfizer round 1 earlier stopped quickly. don’t need worried, I? lady laughed moment I’m kinda curious affects anything MA. Hospitalizations starting go back deaths looking flat Might well start living lives normally. going like flu Assuming older high schoolers good chance vaccinated long anyone even gotten opportunity vaccinated... researcher field I'm trained say ""I know"" proven certain, also know switch jargon audience I'm speaking explain things layman's terms/move away ""I know"" default.

It's communication skill that's sorely lacking many scientific communities. happily partially vaccinated waiting next dose. research vaccines digging raw study data CDC powerpoints make informed decision vaccine when, influenced bias news outlets web forums (either pro anti vaccine)

I initially hesitant back december, type thing afraid going happen. Humans make mistakes. one thing highly effective safe vaccine lab environment, rapidly produce global scale mistakes- unlikely.

This cautious factor antivaxer. antivaxer anti-science thinks vaccines bad you.

The cautious vaxers cautious there's lot political financial pressure get vaccines quickly possible. Everything that's manufactured bugs version 1.0 people prefer wait version 2.0.

I got cautiousness something like 100 million doses already produced. I'd lying said would willing first line. They're particularly reliable source, regardless whether they've done something right blue moon not. obvious people, perhaps you. EU shouldnt agreed export any. countries ordered companies based EU could made arrangements. Huh? supposed arrive 12zh April. ship doses produced EU US?
But takes MONTH approval EU ship single dose? Ridiculous. surge. TX, NC, MI climbing. Rural populations older, less healthy, less access health care. rural areas, buildings spaced out, meant people are. People still gather elsewhere. probably need specify medications takes. ask doctor instead Reddit. someone might know something. think UN needs intervene. doubt though. don’t stop wearing mask? can’t catch spread anymore. continuing wear you’re propagating idea you’re possibly infectious you’re not. it’s German car made USA. makes German/American. hence strange reason USA needed cars factories ensure survival citizens, would totally right stop exports even tell facility make something else. factories WW2. 6 months....... entering winter zero population immunity. could end big deal.  EU policy allowing exports. places don't. policy hurt EU, helped rest world. That's unscientific. Everybody knows crystals heal diseases. read FaceBook yesterday!  /s Greece. AZ vaccine presented government absolutely safe vaccine connection blood clot related deaths. government control media completely failed strenghthen health care system stop spread virus even harsh ""lockdown"" measures. 


At time dozen cases published far, deaths happened hours days vaccination. government dismisses causality without proper investigation, natural people second thoughts.

The consensus among many clients pharmacy work AZ vaccine lower quality dangerous injected with. try convince show trust massive effort gain lives back honestly, dont feel comfortable AZ apologist transparency regarding investigations severe side-effects. Anything short life threatening trauma you’ll admitted seen hospital. 

Broken ankle? - X Ray, exams, splinting. Sent home brace wheelchair

Pneumonia, oxygen levels plunging 90% ?(should around 100%) admitted sent home immediately oxygen tank. Told you’ll get follow call nurse later

Ambulances waiting 6 hours parking bays find hospital accept patients.

Medical staff working beyond legal work hour patient load limits consecutive weeks - laws waived otherwise would one care patients. critical care nursing home staffs completely abandoned staff - patients taken elsewhere.

All things happened people knew US hospitals “near” collapse around December totally collapsed. Ankle nursing home Southern California. Pneumonia Pittsburgh. problem confounding factor present studies long covid. least giving us upper bound (5-10%?) common is. Damn, never even nominated Pulitzer work investigating international finance violations. Less 225 kids died Covid US. children die Drowning every year, going ban swimming pools now? waiting health official tell stop? I’ve already stopped. reaction moderna. Working helps arm next day. Fatigue severe me, reasons true  completely irrelevant original comment.

Sharing includes element ownership. something, can't share it. point EU doses exported. export ban US UK. fact, plenty materials flow UK support EU vaccine manufacturing. EU slower establishing production first place. takes time ramp things up. modern flu descendant Spanish Flu? Could Covid enters endemic phase. honestly depends entirely live. Totally. refers diverting patients due full, hospital collapses multiple times year. me, collapse implies event renders thing inoperable afterward. Like building collapses rebuild use again. Maybe I’m literal it, it’d nice know exactly scared therefore avert it. Near 0 adjust packaging compatible two  organization said rest world nothing worry Covid first broke China? /s J&amp;J also starting mobile clinics vaccinating people trouble getting vaccination sites eg Time unionize :P

Jk, yes, hope there's need extra vaccines, somehow govt stop paying fucking assholes would charge us $300 pocket every year stupid shit. Good luck! good news effects last day two. Constitution United States supports right free speech. basis “American values”. motor designed manufactured Germany. rest car might South Carolina makes nauseous logic private company operates country provides tax funded infrastructure, educated staff, police protection, working judicial system, military protection invaders anything else government funded, partially product country. country mean people work live there.

It’s founder BNT example chose lab Germany Papua New Guinea. 

Private companies need working state do. Yup. someone ability pick went way make sure got Pfizer. Moderna slightly higher rate side effects Johnson &amp; Johnson way low efficacy likes. Private companies happen located within USA also signed contracts supply deals. difference USA claims vaccines produced allow exported.

In end, matters produced. mind. True. It’s combination socially enforced guilt threat punishment America. much people hate flu analogy, virus really like flu, pre-existing immunity it.

Seniors, vulnerable, health care workers going get annual covid flu shots, everyone else bother. They’ve artificially holding back available appointments direct gets made point prioritize black Spanish neighborhoods north side residents. 

Everyone needs vaccine equally regardless neighborhood one main reasons south side hit harder residents didn’t take precautions way north siders did. They’re benefiting lack care responsibility. Short answer: yes. Next decade EU fuck badly?  seems like kind misleading title, least could phrased differently. ""Covid-19 vaccine protection continues remain effective earliest observed recipients."" much closer actual message. sounds like, ""It's good six months, much longer past that, knows.""  think people place much emphasis titles medical community. Nurses Doctors different roles, can’t really function independently one another. Experience truly gives “qualification” medicine, degree. would appropriate criticize brand new PGY-1 nurse 40+ years balanced experience. important lesson anyone kind medical training learn don’t know shit, always something new learn. 

And record, nurses definitely trained think critically medicine, doesn’t stick them, lol. fair, probably absurdly difficult accurately track things. Testing data imperfect is. Yes. 

Shot one: body idea is, especially never covid says “hmm weird...” files new info away don’t get sick vaccine live little immune reaction. 

Shot two: body says BOY HOWDY KNOW YOU’RE BAD GUY!!! attacks dead virus. Germs make sick immune response. 400 placebo 9 got infected, really tell anything efficiency vaccine. That’s true sure. many publishers “news” content, majority editorial policy ethics. least newspapers those.  not, unfortunately. That's Statutory Sick Pay exists - £95 per week. basically like equivalent JSA. difference employer pay it, government.

Employers give fully paid sick days, 4 actually people get. ELI5- six months we’d need boosters? sick days thing typically found non-union, retail and/or food service positions, obviously places too. handful countries guaranteed leave (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Tonga (though they're working it), United States). Literally every country sort guaranteed leave. industries listed above, time way ""guarantee"" get time due illness able find replacement shift. 

Since people work jobs can't afford take time off, let alone pay doctor's visit (since positions typically come insurance), they'll come work sick, hoping sent home lose job due call/no show (since that's typically get written calling sick without proper notice). predatory shit planet, know, good 'ol American bootstrap mentality... mayor Detroit turning J&amp;J doses especially annoying light recent spike. happens six months? know it’s good six months? bad. 6 months 1 day untenable. starts well good we’re applying common sense, like right banning public health misinformation. arbiter truth? decides what’s worthy banning?

There come point Americans learn 1st Amendment first included Constitution. Downvote want, I’m proud, COVID-vaccinated citizen support 1A death. Well, 5500 deaths much, stop vehicle traffic smoking?

Do think makes sense change human behaviour 300 Mio. people fundamentally prevent 5500 deaths? prevent flu deaths year decades?

Masks destroy human communication proper breathing. Especially children.
Also, germs viruses important human immune system, millions years. reason humans born without masks. flu alone knock someone feet week easily. Again, definitely part problem. +3.36 million according Cyrus Shahpar versus +2.83 million last Thursday. Highest Thursday record. Rolling average 2.91 million. Expecting 3 million reached weekend. No. Okay, cool. I'm happy you. really insightful. bet legitimately this. effective like wearing full body armor get shot face still die. 

So saying I'm Batman. 3. Yes arent allowed, put positions getting sick almost guarantee amd bosses betting many coworkers going get sick. No, people 'confused' whatever 'model' education nursing school uses hope one allowed grasp importance vaccines better average. Okay, but, live state guarantees it...yet still get PTO. happy friends position. phase 3 data required EUA, done already. protection due it, there’s harm waiting.

also big pharma terrible, think BioNTech company developed vaccine pfizer manufacturer. That's BS agree it.

I also could hours cut favor employee take time off.  could put lesser position. There's thousand ways could punished taking time off, without saying vaccine, know took off.

Don't think one second things like happen. yes, paper, right. paper rarely matches reality. True one knows long term effects, it’s widely agreed upon scientists physicians relevant expertise it’s unlikely long term negative effects 

As cases people vaccinated, that’s studies showing. people get covid-19 compared control arm vaccines shows 90%+ efficacy. Doesn’t mean absolutely won’t get covid you’re immunized, mean it’s unlikely do, it’s even unlikely severe case.

Please consider getting vaccinated, helps data also suggest stop spreading others!  needle

I see there. point fact don’t yet know sure whether AZ working reduce infections it’s fact harsh lockdown 3 months. look Isreal Pfizer’s data. may need boosters, don’t know sure Pfizer/Moderna know sure need AZ; even need mRNA boosters protection comprehensive it’s easier make, vector problems. 

Try sell public, oh yeah vaccine oh doesn’t work variant, locking - people going go apeshit people going question point vaccine, long run it’s worse vaccine uptake. Notwithstanding US/Isreal partying vaccine.

As said US end vaccination soon powerhouse levels production ramp - really see reason wouldn’t able pump money get slice pie vaccinate entire population heard lasts weeks, us never it. unfortunately got morbidly obese grandma severe lung disease lifetime smoking need able help emergencies, feel safe we're vaccinated.

You need read history. Clickbaity headlines par course long newspapers around. US went wars headlines sell. shit ain’t new. Thank response! hadn’t heard side effect, bit jarring. minds tend go extreme, it’s bit scary. give us wake call make sure yearly check ups though. Holy crap amazing! 

Being 15, probably shot I’ll getting, I’m happy. I'm hoping get booster included annual flu shot. expect flu shot year include COVID-19.  Nice, also getting first shot Tuesday, can't wait. everyone needs new shot every 6 months year actually achieve herd immunity? hope move date statewide vaccinations. PA, Washington Virginia recently. Fingers crossed “At least” Interesting. would expected rural communities kind naturally socially distanced. Stupidest comment post award goes arduinonut, congrats flush rest turds? Lots replies reek ""it happened me, couldnt happen thee"". asserting there’s level risk vaccinated people scared untrue nothing fear mongering would've thought

This obnoxious phrase needs die throwing idea fun: U.S. sent 100% doses needed vaccinate everyone Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Samoa etc. right now? would save shipping logistics efforts outside lower 48 (and PR, USVI) allow U.S. better target expedite batches remaining locales.

Just idea. obviously know happen. seem rather confident virus can't evade immunity. scientific world keeps trying evaluate variants evade immunity. damn confident researchers field not?

As far much change evade tests? idea. wheel house. many damn conditions scenario. according article, chancing catching vaccine zero, they're 3/4000.

Also, research front line workers; expect group people getting exposure/higher viral load average bear.

Give break. ridiculous thing even debate. Bro, they're literally saying ""*at least* six months."" They're saying 6 months absolute minimum. Maybe safer maybe rational thing do, it’s strange put recommendation little explanation. asshole

I'm going pop say that's exactly coming across. mRNA vaccines 100% effective adolescents. vaccinate starting younger, potentially rely less older effectiveness drops. 

But vaccinating incentivized insurance carriers increase adoption. new threats, substantially permanently altar future health technology.

Posts like removed misinformation. call anyone anything. I'm saying can't really hot face reality many people avoiding vaccination intentionally.

Edit: lol everybody getting downvoted exchange I'm really sure saying. keep saying things contradict other. said range natural immunity 6-8 months, agreeing that's least 8 months likely longer. 

No one hypothesizing 6-8 months right now, maybe year ago everyone agrees likely last much longer. delay continues, hope it’s delay ban

If India follows US example vaccinating population allowing exports, vaccines India months. 

The wording ""the situation India stabilize"" allowing exports. Data countries show vaccination much impact infection growth least 60% population vaccinated, unless accompanied strict lockdown.

Here’s thing: walking weapon others unvaccinated. are. Also worth mentioning, Bolsonaro refused buy 70 million doses Pfizer back August, made attempt buy vaccines (the fucker said manufacturers interest sell vaccines come him, even one came refused...) tried sabotage acquisitions many vaccines. Somehow federal institution managed strike deal AstraZeneca locally manufacture vaccines, start June \~ July.

The reason likely early days pandemic army factory manufacture absurd amount chloroquine declared pandemic over. there's stock 15 years worth chloroquine there's way explain expenses.

Worse yet, he's trying play people's saviour everything prevent lockdowns. economic fallout real help government, small companies going bankrupt people going unemployed, hungry desperate. Bolsonaro used try damage image governors mayors implemented lockdowns, many people buying narrative getting angry people ""keeping work"", idiot stopped getting vaccinated earlier, stupid ones believing day chloroquine save death.

If think bad he's incompetent, imagine wasn't... Look test numbers. Lack testing means lack reported cases. Goof news, didnt wait 2 weeks see surge.

People 45 high risk. stats directed prove point. Cases rising weeks (Up 35% month), deaths still continue drop (Down 31% month).
Deaths lag, month. Cases metric concerned itself, especially hospitalizations deaths mirroring last year. *graph shows half states steady decreasing* Thanks, appreciate it. hard process fact gone. Please everyone get vaccinated asap. would saved BiL life back then. +6,790 today, highest since February. saying? need get Pfizer complete oversight part. There's reason UK rejected Oxford's alliance American pharmaceutical firm.

Sorry, really know works, bit confused. vision less politicians believe vaccine saw urgency. America money vaccine way mess save economy - worry cost spent crazy amounts purchasing, planning, production distribution. It’s rising, things (cases, Ed visits, hospitalizations, deaths, etc) rising proportions last surge? No. bad, bad last rise. It’s good/bad, it’s understanding context numbers relate previous surges.

Doesn’t appear tk demand issue. 

It shows 30% state gotten least one shot. Woot woot France around 50% population vaccine terrible rollout. terrible time moment, that's different point made. It’s certainly strategic mistake EU governments reliant parts supply chain outside EU. Globalisation works times crises.

That learn PPE shortages mind blowing me,

The uk much better regards. Two weeks later, Florida reported +6,790 cases today, highest since Feb.

Turns out, another covimbicile proven wrong. know someone who's vaccinated means I'm vaccinated right

and can’t carry virus (it small ) far Programmers innate distrust computer technology.

This one totally legit though. Programmers know anything remotely complex bugs, hardware glitches issues exist. miracle stuff works well does.

Wtf even going Germany anymore? Common sense clearly ain't part it. Nope thanks Pfizer Northern burbs won’t see awhile.

Bruh seriously? think perfectly reasonable countries restrict entry visitors based vaccination status. Whether person's vaccination status validated via passport means, confirm vaccination status visiting foreign country perfectly reasonable thing request.

For anyone wanting get vaccinated willing prove vaccination status, mandatory Covid test quarantine reasonable alternatives. aren’t vaccinated yet people care aren’t vaccinated worried people letting guard early going cause one last surge. Even vaccinated chance surge could hurt ability get medical care something else overwhelms hospitals. Long term though vaccinations beat covid it’s question many people die last surge. Saying isn’t seen insignificant amount lost neither ungrateful have, arguing something could done it. Recoverable valuable time passed, yes, insignificant. Here’s normal “leave information pretend it’s death life” post.

\- Project long it'll take people offered vax get (&amp; develop immunity)

\- Release vax

\- Publicize date end mask mandate

What they're instead creating artificially higher risk period vaccinated many others aren't. clear - care people refuse get it. I'm saying date lift mask mandate probably sooner 10 weeks (assume flawless distribution operation, takes 1 month vax whole state's willing population, 3-4 weeks doses + waiting period beyond second dose) vaccine, detect unvaccinated presence. another perk biologically 5G capable now. Could be, getting bit confusing keeping track studies haha 

I believe Moderna also testing variety second generation vaccines either stored normal freezer temperatures given one dose Heh, true! know mean. American. Europe first world, much choice. either AZ AZ :) Nah wear it, it’s uncomfortable I’m damn sick it. Quit using strawman “yOu dOnT cAre OtheRs” simply somebody doesn’t absolutely love wearing mask. Also, access mean point anyone sign appointment accepted scheduled immediately near term period. time, anyone doesn’t vax can’t get refuses get shouldn’t expect entire world stop turning. count 50 million doses Pfizer spoiled fall. would shock slightest nerd Lockheed figured make blimp even show radar.  scheduled first dose Apr 19, 4 days I'm eligible 💪 feels damn far away   That’s like saying “Trump said masks lame, won’t wear them.” really need politician’s behavior determine yours? live one countries still suspended AZ vaccine. Although third country skeptical AZ vaccine specifically, overall vaccine hesitancy affected - still well 90% people want vaccinated.

Some interviewees reasoned exactly (and agree with): authorities suspending one vaccine reasonable suspicion dangerous side effects part *why* feel safe getting vaccinated. think people perfectly capable discerning ""one vaccine potentially dangerous side effects"" ""all vaccines composed Satan"". remotely comparable birth control. believe told clades/variants concern. adult population nyc 6 million people, getting israel ~50% vaccinated requires already process get second shot additional 1 million next weeks. Currently vaccinating around 60-70k day doable. CDC would probably recommend everyone live lives plastic bubbles forever could, one listening.

Once cases decline negligible amount, one wearing masks regardless long vaccines last. notion - promoted public officials - spread occurring solely social gatherings full ignoring spread workplaces damn irresponsible pathetic. hope puts whole vaccine rollout perspective.

Wisconsin decided (for better worse) 60 day emergency order legislature would need extend. Moderna today. side effects me. Thank Nope, trial. Excellent!!!! Ok, March 4th 2020 Texas reported 1 case. record. Saying something sensational like ""record low cases"" without bounds kind ridiculous. say, ""Texas currently lowest 7 day average case count (3,452) since September 2020"" making accurate statement. least EU suckers keep handing guys vaccines, enjoy!

A US company receiving billions US funding, establishing supply chains production US funding, supplying vaccines factory EU US funding totally EU 'handing US'. production used supply Europe, dilly-dallied months US already signed deals J&amp;J start production. thanking US acting swiftly did. Thank responding. late 50s early 60s, health problems, nothing immune related though. definitely got shot. got shots late December, might early January though, Washington state live Ontario, kind relaying information father. guess got vaccines would dead. Yes, read many saying pump dump scheme Zika virus.

Provide context? sure mean. answered question. want people vaccinated restrictions lifted! want live according lie vaccinated people spread disease deadly children adults wear five masks stay inside forever. takes 3 weeks getting last shot reach ""safe"".

Just getting shot mean people go back licking doorknobs US, tackled electing new president lie pandemic, cover up, ignore health experts. Brazil that. do, screwed. sounds like best control control getting vaccine getting tested. seems like vaccine starts offer decent protection within 5-7 days getting (it could sooner that’s proof of). heard somewhere also lessen symptoms already contracted it, don’t link anything top head. Sending well wishes all’s way! makes think didn’t read it? especially loved part “concerned fitness classes collegiate athletics.” only, mean only, concern right getting shots arms 70+ yr olds. gives shit fitness classes. Twelve months crap counting. get saying, ideal world would answer. Like walk store, restaurant, whatever show card get sticker says I'm vaccinated - need mask, we're good. 

But see ton people enforcing kind stuff.  happen fake vaccination cards sale, people make stickers, underpaid employees already struggle anything mask compliance another layer shit deal with.

There lot cynical people really give fuck reality things. 

Bars good IDing real, constant threat huge punishments caught serving underaged people.  bars level ""threat"" mask compliance would serving underaged people time. Takes time administer doses even everyone technically “access”. Additionally, people can’t get vaccines whatever reasons (health, age, whatever).

Based previous couple posts doubt could care less anyone, anyway. Imagine butthurt piece cloth frothing mouth take lol. seems American companies edge (yes know Biontech German) reports describing cases, yes, suggested ways treating it, yes. would expect. single study demonstrating statistically significant caused vaccine though. Ok Ron 👌 someone postpone getting vaccine returning traveling another part country? Quarantine, vaccine? Masks make life difficult deaf people. rely lipreading. people wearing masks, can't communicate them. alternative lipreading really works real world. Gestures notes alternatives. help communication all. *Does it, though?*

I could see Japanese mask phenomenon pop around globe. That's common thing like last 12-15 years. rather, yes, reason we're talking misleading media trying craft narrative. Let's hope! Mask mandates and/or masks required enter businesses forever? Nah.

Masks becoming accepted social norm sick must leave house, anyone wants wear one preference? Yeah. Poor phrasing, yes! I've quoting studies like Reddit, generally describe effective.""

Even turns 99.6% would generally round 100%, difference popular mindset significant. sort like food calls ""fat-free"" ""calorie-free"" actually (super-small) serving size less half calorie gram fat - eat much, still get fat calories. Similarly, give vaccine lot people, 100% effective anymore. None vaccinated test subjects got disease. part math makes 100%?  much cytokine storm theory explained mechanisms. dont' articles front me, cytokine storm observed small sample people fit, took find another better fitting hypothesis. Give one reason still wearing masks anyone wants vaccine get easily. long wait times. Btw, masks “too much cross bear” wouldn’t ever wear one. wear it, hate it, makes nose dry, staph infection whatever call red bumps nose. It’s annoying af I’m sick it, still wear it. scientists CDC gonna tell policy makers CDC vaccinated people pose essentially risk therefore resume normal activities? feel like CDC national leaders speaking sides mouth this.

These things take time. recommendations people charge massively consequential. right careful. bats: they're reservoir risk. Would something agree leaders either? agree lockdowns masks private gatherings, I'm going leaders can't themselves. Uhh even know fertility means? Zika virus impacting fetus development, ability conceive first place. Anyways, nothing covid. 

Do viruses impact fertility? Yes, bodily infection/illness lower sperm quality till body recovers. covid causing anything excessive normal reduction sperm quality say flu? think so, findings done comparisons viruses. Also, studies exist covid fertility good job taking care confounding variables like stress, nutrition, sleep etc. know ambulance driver would tell kept transporting kids organs fried covid, good news last confirmed covid transport 2 months ago, there's that. fair they've around since 2010 and, despite billions public private sector investment 2010-2019, literally never brought single product market. never even published academic papers. begin with, don’t think happened 1976 deterrent whatsoever present vaccination campaign. people alive remember it, understand skepticism induced. 

The whole thing seems like sunk-cost-fallacy nightmare. fear Fort Dix outbreak start new 1918-style flu pandemic. took watch wait stance US went gung ho. fact, deadly pandemic developed. 

At beginning, technical requirements involving poultry made desirable proceed vaccine production without delay. Fair enough. decision roll entire population eight months later, clearly imminent threat H1N1 anywhere world ... inexplicable. 

As long term effects, per CDC website regarding Guillain-Barré Syndrome:

“ 1976, small increased risk GBS swine flu vaccination, special flu vaccine potential pandemic strain flu virus. National Academy Medicine, formerly known Institute Medicine, conducted scientific review issue 2003 found people received 1976 swine flu vaccine increased risk developing GBS. increased risk approximately one additional case GBS every 100,000 people got swine flu vaccine.”

So it’s like vaccinated dropping like flies. But, apparently, injury caused. would drop bucket face clear present danger, case? seems not.

Small chance vaccine make breakthrough statistic let guard down. 😂😂 Remember said, 'Go ahead, take purge heretic [policy]. see happen."" something effect. post history.

This good start. end. Top bottom, root stem. See waht thar? Gotta work way list, boys. ever give inch people. take everything - every inch - stop. Ever. won't, don't.

Or you. That's me. currently mandatory, think various reasons. 
Those would benefit def take - still doesnt make sense one take account others
Take flu example, thats never compulsory. Covid little effect young healthy individuals - one intervention considered? Absolutely questions? Technically second dose also booster that’s free :) Also took R&amp;D funding, I'm sure strings attached. Weird.

Reddit convinced one, *maybe* two mutations away variant would *completely* bypass immunity built vaccines natural infection, sending us back square one.

Turns immunity doesn’t work like that. would thought? 

Thanks great post! basically everyone who’s died covid. 2.6 average comorbidites. 95% 50. 80% 65. placebo group got it, no, like there's covid around. boss music still playing. college student NYC getting vaccine Sunday, I'm hoping means I'll able go back school person fall. incredibly draining sitting home. Well tolerated restrictions protect risk people, largely vaccinated (or least given opportunity). I'm done moving goalposts. Yeah read article hoping little nuance wasn’t headline didn’t find it. mean, awesome real world Pfizer results agree overly broad statement No, fuck lol results allow authorise teens. Younger kid trials starting - there's discussion top thread. millions doses. I'm use ID cards vouchers, like CDC gives? excuse face scanning.  Yeah, hard know plays out.

Michigan got hit early - say, virus deadlier earlier, treatments good. also caught far, far fewer cases earlier, counterbalances that.

How shake out? Nobody knows. could check antibody counts, there's lot reason believe yield imperfect results. None vaccinated trial group got covid.  Goalposts “death perfectly fine” again! Y’all like three tired fuck “debate” tropes they’re incredibly obvious. 

Just fucking stop, you’re embarrassment. Yemen can't catch break

Unfortunately, situation Yemen bad worse. adults want vaccine vaccinated, worry about? Granted US every adult wants vaccine hasn’t much issue getting it. question is, high risk vaccinated virus poses almost threat teens children, need vaccinate kids? get it, they’ll fight easily antibodies. question whether strict, extended isolation effective, rather realistic.

Then, accept, realistic, effective. Hospital staff worked understaffed long Covid-19. Believe non, people getting sick 2020. Pass around, mutate more, slip past protections place get immunocompromised old gramma can't get shot sick last.

It's good epidemiology crack hard disruptive disease. flu....x10 Doesn’t say much yet, guess testing, would nice research published article tho imo Hopefully republicans antivax flu next year crunch numbers. Insufferable how? Instead personal slight, don’t point wrong. AZ &amp; JJ, standard vaccines

They're far standard. Oxford vaccine ChAd vector never produced scale before. side effects take bit time show up, 24 - 48 hours Creating second class citizens passport country undoubtedly bad thing unless even slightly value smallest individual liberties. God must pissed he's gonna need start new Plague Inc game. someone American Indian background: want presented big “f you” font people saying black Americans valid excuse anti-vaccine beliefs. There’s excuse. single hurt group people United States approached near perfect vaccine acceptance. people every reason trust government, still stepped helped elders duty. 

When see bullshit news articles 5 months discussing “vaccine equity” inner city black people don’t access vaccines accept denial science, remember numbers American Indian communities. thought would good idea make something important Baltimore?  Pfizer Moderna allowing countries produce vaccine. think that's AZ increasing production gradual pace given many countries producing it, makes hiccups likely short term. know plant, something big public eye, eyes watching day one inspecting whole process. Thanks - that's update seen yesterday afternoon. too! Get vaccines folks. end this. get vaccinated tomorrow. stoked! ""In 1961, Janssen Pharmaceuticals purchased New Jersey-based American corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson, became part Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Development (J&amp;J PRD)""

The mistake major embarrassment Johnson &amp; Johnson

[...] thought smoking rates down.

Oooooooooooh. Thank insulting me. proper Actually adult covid higher risk severe disease one it.

The problem cannot quantify that, way compare risk getting blood lot. get blood clot, death rate 40%.

Risk getting covid also varies highly person person

Now fundamental problem layperson like cannot anyway make good decision situation. experts.

The experts actually disagree other. Germany said wait data. said go ahead since risk small.

I probably trust Germany given much credibility anymore.

Apart bad public communication (e.g. evidence human transmission... find evidence like 7 days later), suggested everyone wear masks June 2020, medical expert everyone looks into. unforgivable... set goal like “mask mandates end \~50% population fully vaccinated” would give definitive goal also providing incentive hesitant people get vaccine.

50% population, though? 

As far US concerned, *massive* geographical area divided 50 separate states people travel time. say one state 60% bordering state still stuck 20s 30s. then? 

Or look home state New York even. Nearly half population lives NYC rest spread among area take seven hours get car. Putting percentage goal state whole could still leave huge discrepancy cities. 

And anyone gets silly idea ""afraid going back normal,"" know life hold year continues long we're shut down. one wants see return normal do. want see done safely smartly. states, want set percentage based country - I'd want set based minimum percentage 50 states (or least continental 48) clear. is, instead saying ""once country hits 50%,"" ""once *every state* hit least 50%"" (or whatever number deemed appropriate). mutations may worry though, enough people aren’t vaccinated continues spread, far vaccines seem okay variants, wouldn’t shocked there’s chance mutates something vaccine less effective against. mean offense this, don’t good understanding law. make clear refer “Constitution Bill Rights” two separate entities. 

Not laws laid Constitution. Constitution simply lays powers government rights people upon government cannot infringe. vast majority laws cannot found US Constitution. includes laws create sex offender registry. also includes laws outlaw sex offenses. 

All laws, however, must stand judicial review challenged court law. Ultimately, court believes law violates Constitution, legal obligation strike law (or unconstitutional portion law) down. law doesn’t mentioned Constitution exist—it cannot violate Constitution according courts.

Now let’s get back sex offender registry. purely opinion sex offender registry violates double jeopardy. courts agree. fact, one cases mentioned previous link—I think ex post facto challenge—the court ruled sex offender registry punitive. eyes SCOTUS, viewed punishment. disagree that—some dissenting justices did—but court rule unconstitutional.

So no, completely wrong. sex offender registry example courts throwing Constitution vague “wisdom” standard protecting public. case, Wisconsin judges decided shred Wisconsin law emergency powers nonexistent “wisdom” standard. think they're still saying ""by May 1"" everyone open (or strongly encouraged to). looking like vaccines still effective e484k mutation (South Africa Brazil variant), probably less effective. efficacy data problem variants Novavax’s South African study 60% efficacy compared 89% efficacy original strain. 

So still effective, less effective. wonder mRNA viral vector vaccines perform. bright use, seemed 100% reduction severe COVID matters. Wow guess shows well run pfizer/moderna actual companies. probably prepared better mass production others did.  stressful times life waiting see would get enough unemployment money sustain myself. Good ,I've stopped wearing mask no, let be. Fewer Republicans 2024 election. let get variants guess. Operation warp speed worked vaccine manufacturers allow fund production vaccines approved, allowed stock pile vaccines distributed citizens bypassing existing laws would hinder this. Warp speed funding government agencies administer shot sites running vaccine arrived allow immediate injections. Warp speed also coordinated department defense using aircraft bring doses Germany faster, using military vehicles transportation allowing equipment necessary distribution vaccine sent front lines. probably ban user, interested trolling spreading misinformation. May 1st Metrics, dates I'm confused need this? 

I'm still catching information here, seems Europe solved America bad. Surely 9 months glorious Europe struggling pandemic still?!!? European I'm relieved. part, isolated, wore masks, shot economy numbers finally we're going back normal. tourists bring virus right back would absolutely suck. heard vaccine makes dick grow extra inch. *distant sounds men women screaming “my freedom!* That’s fair thought, we’ve seen work practice nations secure borders. case, long term lockdowns haven’t shown effective tool controlling spread n Re: first paragraph
There still legal requirement wear mask places tx. Something people seem understand say texas moved quickly.

I think important consider compliance enforcement policy reason it. effect due compliance what's difference it? know answers think alot people rush judgement issue seems way complicated really understand point without data. mom Anti-Vaxxer, refuses get vaccine. came shock me. 


Before knew this, personally spent days researching biology concepts studied years could understand mRNA vaccines work. 
I tried passing information onto mom thinks knows refuses listen even though understanding mRNA actually does. 


She thinks vaccines ""change code"", thinks sort unholy evil. idea talking about. actually tried convincing get second dose pfizer. What's worse lives poor sister imagine influencing get shot either dumb fear has. 


My sister bad habit never thinking follows mom says, make matters EVEN worse, husband phobia needles (passes gets shots every time), probably easy convince.  


My mom sister eligible live MONTHS. even know do. stupid preventing sister husband safe.  Push anti-education, anti-vaxx crowd edge flat earth. Lol, amusing read comments people EU sometimes. They're actually quite bit complicated manufacture. need wear mask vaccinated virus kills easily would harder time spreading.

Don't say B.1.1.7 contagious deadly, albeit vaccine preventable contingent supply? that’s would expect vaccinated individuals Zero state-mandated mask requirements **all** 50 states? 

I’ll say July 1, barring something truly unforeseen like escape variant, highly, highly doubt. 

But believe vast majority states like June 1, possibly even mid-may. None vaccines gene therapy, factually inaccurate. One thing many people fail realize that, sick cold flu, symptoms caused virus, least directly. Rather, body causing symptoms fight disease. E.g. fever disease raising body temperature. body raises temperature tends kill pathogens. nose runs body trying flush pathogens. Etc. etc. buy time body (hopefully) create right antibodies target specific disease wipe out. ramps higher losing battle. 

A vaccine essentually dose real pathogen, one can't reproduce like naturally occurring one. body hopefully creates right antibodies fight real thing future. still go standard procedure trigger symptoms.

FWIW, people worst symptoms vaccine would worst time real virus, people mild symptoms probably would ok without it. People zero symptoms might already even know. know else would make fall? mass fallout dead people payouts virus couldn’t contained. must assume people smart enough know wear masks they’ve never ever lives. find later that, like HPV vaccine cervical cancer, covid vaccine protects us form cancer linked covid? Sinopharm also probably gotten approved US efficacy low. CDC primarily concerned giving advice Americans vaccines approved US sinopharm one vaccines. least dude sand storm w/high winds blame. foul totally human Stop banging az vaccine. irrelevant. deliveries way promised even usually can't give reliable predictions next week. opposed asking Reddit, default CDC recommendation. Fully vaccinated people gathering possesses extremely minimal risk, that. can't right. read guys post facebook said flu. misinformation? said 100% effective death.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* awesome, thanks sharing!  Whole lot dummies today. think ""pro virtual society"" done enough snooping around post history. based unpublished study 2,260 children aged 12-15 US. study followed original dosage schedule 21 days found 18 positive cases among fully vaccinated. testing done asymptomatic participants.

These data means nothing scientifically yet good clicks. data need peer reviewed, understanding asymptomatic protection, data vaccine protects original dosage schedule 21 days followed. find confusing all. assume much based confusion. rule law rule law, quote actual law instead something opinion article it? read can't possibly understand law procedures.... yet.... declare illegal. kinda find confusing learned free thinkers like make go. fucks sake, Baltimore. opposite end we’ve also told people year we’re overwhelm hospitals keep elderly population safe. People see elderly getting majority vaccinated longer care. That’s told protect Oh agree. would make lot people's lives bit easier. there's talk US going open EU/UK mid May - Americans think US going require vaccine passports negative PCR test going enough? 

As we've stopped AZ vaccinations Germany discussing mixing different vaccines also wonder would accepted governments? many unused vaccines. could already ship many countries still enough left. 78% usage remained weeks always supply amount administered daily (or more). Also, mRNA vaccines shown 80-90% effective one dose, partially vaccinate people, covid fizzle quickly.

Just look California. infection numbers quickly decreasing people get vaccinated. nearly every vaccine around 2 weeks provide meaningful amount protection. think one impressive stories two mRNA vaccines, looked quite critically beginning, due first kind due complex logistical requirements, turned safe, extremely effective least error scandal prone. AZ &amp; JJ, standard vaccines, kinds hiccups. swear, SUPER tired hearing certain group people “want locked forever.” Maybe people would like higher rate people vaccinated act locking won’t vain, shit finally go away without fucking half “new normal” measures. infuriating read crap, always “us vs them.” I've flown delta dozens times since August. really impressed me. fly AA last week since option. Wow, huge difference. could see delta cared, American bare minimum damnit Based comments you’re “pro” virtual society economy future. That’s obviously going happen overall though jump board get back life don’t. Nobody really cares personally. Oh yeah. 

I gonna see helper since fully vaccinated, 
I wondering could tell risk would us see other? time do, beyond two week immunity two doses. live NJ, state mentioned. CDC says see people case safely, deathly afraid virus. seen since last March finally seem like chance get together again. Good data Pfizer equal bad data J&amp;J. data vaccine soon, protected, that's matters far apart two Covid infections, mind asking? Yes, ran out, means every mask critical. made reusing masks past useful life. Every mask take away means masks used past useful life, ultimately sick doctors nurses overwhelmed hospitals.

Yes, CDC telling people use cloth masks would saved lives. would cost lives hospitals (or parking lots) saved grocery stores. CDC's job treat lives equally take actions save lives, means prioritizing healthcare workers rest us, save others.

They screw up. knew exactly doing. lied us, would happily again. That's job. Well, throw first stone never delayed vaccination program weeks pandemic. completely unaware that. understand would push person antivax. Thanks letting know. official website country sais 25 people 20 million vaccinations.

So that's less like 1 1 million. wait see people know arguing need get vaccinated everyone else's vaccine protect them.

Kinda cowardly ask me. rest world dire need supply, sooner US finish vaccination, sooner start sending doses produced places need it, too. 

I know we’ll get eventually might biggest setback imaginable, it’s still 15 million people wait longer, 15 million shots less way ending soon possible. states countries don’t even many people living them. Fauci's words pessimistic video though, disingenous, stated comment: response legitimate question, Fauci disembled ""So saying masks work?""

To me, that's sheer incompetence negligence. see advice would better different setting sure I'm actually optimistic current situation. possibility obviously feel doom gloom something evidence even occured yet. First class 175 better narrowbody FC. Prove wrong. work healthcare covid positive patients. exposed general population Right, loophole law regarding masks law doesn’t count dealing them. 

Are opinion laws suspended governor commit illegal power grab? that’s way get think right.... Using logic, also don’t know COVID causes kids grow third arm reach 20. mean come on. remember reading comments Moderna big grift investors pointless US buy doses company product market


Don't trust random people reddit, idea talking Lol bet you’re scientist huh leaders even follow rules (looking you, Newsom pelosi), expect public to? know anecdotal, wife RN admitted 64 yr old covid19 vaccinated 3 weeks ago moderna (first dose) Yeah, guys job.  data suggests vaccinated individuals carry virus

Also, huge problem meaning ""don't"". gap ""basically don't"" (like 95% efficacy) ""absolutely can't"" (100.00% efficacy) pretty damn wide. article linked post frankly terrible job pointing out. implies latter quietly showing former: ""Among fully vaccinated people study, three COVID-19 infections detected... Unvaccinated participants logged 161 covid cases...""

I totally understand people *want* ignore data believe vaccines 100% effective individual level. think desperate wish leaking media coverage even CDC statements. true. Vaccines 100% effective population level, herd immunity vanquishes disease. Well, least guy blocked Suez Canal someone point to.

""Sure, blocked world's important shipping lane week, least throw 15 million vaccines trash worldwide pandemic."" Obviously it’s good, mistakes happen though seems like caught issue went out? Screw anti-vaxxers, aren’t vaccine they’re worried production issues, non-factor dopes   one def case! southern California October, assure lot almost state yet...

And yet California bottom half states deaths per capita having:

* Numerous high density cities
* High poverty compared national average
* High homelessness compared national average
* Massive immigrant minority population overwhelmingly live multigenerational households work essential service jobs.

Seems California much much high risk states still better. Keyboard warriors 🥱 ton different colds, rhino. chance would right cold lead rampant Covid pretty slim comparing transmit (Covid transmission much rapidly rhino). would need knee deep baby care centers playgrounds transmit colds nearly efficiently covid - assuming mask wearing entire period infecting everyone. would end very, badly...see Brazil imagine much worse.  cell comment may little harsh referencing fact historically unable generate protective vaccines infections require cell mediated immunity. Yes get cell response vaccines, response subset helper population needed help induce antibody response. main mechanism action vaccine cell mediated, antibody/B cell mediated. memory cells induced may help aid re-inducing response variant setting initial response activated overwhelmed important mechanism first serum antibodies produced long lived plasma cells (type B cell) provide sterilizing immunity initial infection activation memory B cells overwhelmed. cells would come response aid antibody generation. Understandable, even 1 case entire county would put 5 per 100k, keeps red tier.  Sigh. option last week sign Pfizer Johnson Johnson chose J&amp;J one done, tested variants circulating closer traditional vaccine. got Monday know it’s affected vaccine, news Pfizer week much effective one dose essentially stopping transmission really regretting getting Pfizer instead. variant could pop evades immunity mean treat inevitably. Mutations random. likely virus mutates something less deadly. Let’s ban Alex berenson twitter start nothing suggests this. also user above, kids long term organ problems, anything said it?

Except first world countries actively trying prevent 3rd world countries getting vaccine. virus mutate something vaccine cant prevent Corona Virus round 2. things become toxic high doses (ie, take much Tylenol even doesn’t relieve headache), otherwise plateau. Even beyond that, get something like 95% efficacy rate real, physiological difference 97.5% single individual either worth clinically relevant all.  39.5% Canada's population.. don’t think means much it’s bad sign.

Doesn’t matter either way, op getting tested, good I’m fighting burnout That's tail end third wave. Nothing so-called fourth wave. Disability discrimination plainly illegal. Federal law would stop scenario.

Not vaccinated disability. That’s easy clear. California’s tiers don’t make sense, change much arbitrary. Plus, there’s maskless normal. Moderna ready two weeks Covid sequenced. mRNA platform really fast comes minor changes alterations - much faster regulatory process prove changes.

A mutation specific booster probably coming, right current mRNA vaccines still handle variants.   county already 40% adults, vaccinations fully open 2 weeks. Anyone still waiting first dose Memorial Day, probably even weeks earlier, isn’t trying hard enough support. month next going vaccinate everyone wants one US. reason restrictions that. earlier hypothetical, believe based nonsense low numbers, 5,000 lives, actual sentient human beings, much spilt milk save societal cost kids seeing stranger's faces year. 34 dead fetuses, fact provided source BTW, *is* high cost save lives vaccination?

That crazy. conversation crazy I'm done it. Virus doesn’t give shit politics borders opened state/county/city everyone week tons available appointments got snatched up, nothing available good news. 

My entire county hit 30% vaccinated tomorrow Finally appointment Monday, fucking happy. Pfizer too. It’s joke, I’m happy. absolutely data Moderna's long term efficacy. whole point infer efficacy mRNA. Moderna far worse adverse-effect way look totally different vaccines Lol know arguing bad faith. says right page stopped collecting data March 7. current data include last 3 weeks. Gotcha. Pesky Delaware ;) that's sick leave for? would export stop like UK US. still hope society this?

But seriously, everyone opportunity vaccinated things go back normal exceptions. top trying tell Russian Chinese vaccines planning rolling safer AZ?

Those vaccines safe. controversies safety. even invoke even know can’t trust data related studies? 

Well that's circular reasoning. Sputnik V's interim phase 3 clinical trial results peer-reviewed. Mexico's government recently came table incidence rate mild severe side effects people vaccinated several different vaccines they're using Sputnik V safest metric. people social skills lot going personal life. Repeating shit best come with, getting upvotes like-minded people makes feel witty liked.

I wonder many spammers actively profiting trading. pet theory small percentage making money “memes” convincing suckers prop stock, majority left holding bag, buying late high want part meme EU already included clauses booster shots variants contracts manufacturers couple months ago. know many restrictions life due able trust general populace? Like every time want buy bottle wine grocery store, show ID people lie. I’m arms it.

We probably agree this, point going back forth. funny thing I’ve fully vaccinated since February due job, don’t problem wearing mask I’m asked public know vast majority people vaccinated yet. wear one grocery store public places. go restaurant bar, I’ll wear one table take eat drink. I’m friends home theirs, don’t wear one. You’re one that’s even fully vaxed, even upset? Learn make titles stupid. Lol there’s absolutely possibility it? don’t get tested come contact virus exactly you? Gee, really helps German people right huh? Nothing government says affect braindead morons think this. true start. thing works mandates. Look successful countries- government mandates, suggestions. EU already included clauses booster shots variants contracts manufacturers couple months ago. add herd immunity getting infected. shit coming end. sounds like needle reaction I’ve past. get tested disease reason believe have? dude learn read Irrelevant point. EU exporting vaccines. due respect it’s insane worried given circumstances Moderna really induce CD8+ Tcells enough meaningful, theyd boast it. question is, whats % participants successfully induced? level lower, higher equal recovered patients mild cases? quality functional matters too. 

For example: JnJ Nab,cd4,cd8 75% induced younger group 30% older group (over 65) 

if 65, would choose JnJ? No, Pfizer would better choice. However, youre 25 yrs old healthy, JnJ fine better nothing, aways boost another vector next year AZ think mixing might good idea, work Russian Institute. important thing money started flowing production. August. supervisor morning fact discouraging coworker mine getting vaccinated age group BS sub deep, deep, deep denial regarding cases, deaths, likelihood fourth wave. understand much transmissible UK variant compared older strands. also grasp yes, people survive many serious complications impact quality life, ability work, etc. People wear masks Asia almost entirely big cities, wear masks viruses air pollution. can’t get decent 3 bedroom house NJ 300k. that’s boonies way Poconos. You’re taking 450-650 get closer NYC. live like flu thanks Pfizer Human trials way UK. You’re right, let’s go back constant Arrested Development references, maeby les cousins talk touching always money banana stand lolololololol

Reddit’s always memey redundant shithole, best far blocking everyone says dumb things. Pfizer earlier today, shot felt like starting get hot/sweaty (I went kind nervous already tho tbh) honestly think anxiety, feel fine besides slightly sore arm. self assessment end comment basically situation call pandemic late stop it? read wrote. scared shitless hypotheticals (variants, decreased efficacy). immmunity begins fade, we'll know able provide boosters completely goes away. We'll always threat variants, justifying restrictions pathway masks forever bullshit. Flu constant threat mutate pandemic flu, covid's similar threat shouldnt different. baseline ~1k deaths day become ""very deaths""??  read study limitations? Invested domestic supplies etc  even know start, worst vaccines study field, made mistakes dilluting part members study, stretched data had, real data older population, although older population affected. business behavior lot better, recently published numbers study US withdraw next day. 

It funny UK suspects others nationalism politics. outside looks like lot national pride UK involved here. things going ignored honest people. 

It may safe, may worth risk - options. got second dose Pfizer Saturday like Christmas present done worry articles like anymore mean I'd definitely favor law permitting citizens take time receive vaccine, think thats bad idea. I'm saying idea entirety US businesses unfeeling uncaring would fire employees letting take half day get vaccine bit strawman. feel like reason cool reddit pretend US dystopian corporatist hellscape we're thumb unfeeling capitalists reality. German government government fund Covid vaccine development. 

The EU contracts suppliers already include clauses switching booster shots variants currently developed Biontech CureVac, two companies funded German government. Also, though vaccine highly effective highly safe, 100% effective 100% safe.

Can name single medication vaccine is? People allergic aspirin, that's standard science medicine ever held to. Relative vaccines, they're pretty damn effective flu shot. Personally, want anything go back normal. Look ‘neutralising immunity’. Yes, show home office Yes, dont say anything that. works whole situation germany vaccine age restrictions annoying. whole world doesnt care vaccine everything find......and germany? Oh astra zeneca us peopel 60 biontech forbidden.... Oh clogs age 60? peopel 60? got shot sunday suddenly meetings stay replace mrna vax??

Cmon mess US EU? There's high % of, well I'll let fill blank. Thanks Hey I'm halfway vaccinated excited second dose weeks. certainly would comfortable first line. evidence ""sweeping rug"" I'm aware of, government corruption exactly strangers, naive think billions trillions dollars stake vaccines work people accept them. Also, though vaccine highly effective highly safe, 100% effective 100% safe. good outweighs bad, vaccines authorized emergency use (i.e. experimental) study even yet - clinical trial goes another year. data looks good ""so far"" highly believed provide way benefit harm, that's authorized emergency use.

Again, I'm vaccine, already received first dose. I'm going pressures criticize someone else wanting something body want do.

it's bit ironic pfizer delivered astrazeneca. Yea even discussed people said might implemented Peer review: process boss emails header ""PLEASE READ COMMENT 1:30"" starting lunch break.

But real, data going far scrutiny standard peer review. Even Governor Newsom, advertised “stricter Cuomo” caught birthday party indoor dining. agree covid probably lot weaker several decades well. hit hurricanes last season? feel like number way higher due natural disasters number 10x higher. I'm guessing also booster cover new variants? no? 9 deaths possibly associated 2.7M vaccinations.

That means getting vaccine dangerous driving 80km car, considering [Germany’s trafficking fatality rural always handle better virus works. issue people fairly regularly move around counties, need bigger net look things larger scale. virus care county lines start end.

Ex: Rutherford county lifts mask mandate, lot people Rutherford work and/or travel Davidson, population dense area. clearly see issue. i'd go vaccinated percent number cases. Pretty much. Cases won’t drastically spike way put Thats bad day office need develop nuclear Arsenal get rid Michigan straight typical blood clot issue though. like DIC, blood clots even though thrombocytes get extremely low. think should, what’s point legislature

That's exactly point. Wisconsin legislature Republican, means Governor adult room. JJ needs market “anti-vaccine”. Problem solved. half wits get vaccinated we’ll survive human race! Ahhhhhhhh. never call confused Yes, last summer articles Moderna experience going F everything uo Nice Per CDC: ""People tested positive COVID-19 within past 3 months recovered quarantine get tested long develop new symptoms.""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Incorrect. White House *did* increase Michigan's allocation Multiple surprising. WA 0.01% fully vaccinated people got virus according DOH. Except lefties surrounded conservative areas. conservatives like visit nice areas. though stay own. effective, that’s even debatable unless don’t like them. people thread floating idea lockdowns masks past certain point might good thing immune system pretty weak due lowered exposure, fair point. say lockdowns masks aren’t effective bullshit. 

As Michigander, I’d point many people didn’t follow mask mandates begin with. mobility returned back pre-pandemic numbers within months start; people may staying home “locking down”.

My daughters school, attended virtually, new cases reported like every day. people locked down.

In-person dining started 2/1. Cases went right that. Surprised? got curbside pickup place week ago looking inside full capacity, probably 100+ people, one wearing mask seated “eating”. 

This isn’t rocket science. Masks effective, people quit giving shit. Hopefully vaccinations lead less deaths hospitalization long time cases go without restrictions. people can’t get it? don’t get make choice also allowed extended, revoked. take law do, agreement session. Legislative branch never create temporary laws emergency. we're war gonna call stay home orders illegal 61 days?  Hahaha. many times session pull ""illegal"" orders? sub while, forgot legal acumen free thinkers. would hate look mandatory vaccination supreme court's rulings there. partially vaccinated person carry increased risk spreading virus? don’t even know fertility impacted know least 3 friends/family rash Pfizer/Moderna. rash issue stop unless life-threatening. thought flu vaccine already: one version flu, get vaccine past versions help fight it. following year, get new vaccine includes previous version flu. Lol. edit that's actually pretty funny answer. There's data supports it'll help already covid. fact, HCP usually recommend waiting least 2 weeks injection mess medicine. Yes point also choose get vaxed would also understand risks. risk(death hospitalization) scared corona get vaxed stay inside. go whatever. cant esp since seems like “must get vaxed people” dont really care talk people concerns dont want Every mask civilian bought would one hospitals have. enough was, point out. would mattered much doctors nurses got sick unable work, compounding disaster.

Community spread less important hospital spread. one mask, good hospital grocery store. enough. Wow go NY that's exactly they'll think haha give two weeks past second shot. 8 weeks probably modest. Beginning July would likely things really return semblance normal. Worth noting, probably right think population homogenous. Even spread perspective, considerable evidence spread primarily superspreaders, superspreaders likely old obese.

That's say kids can't spread COVID, might see pretty appreciable effect without vaccinating kids. hard study though, we'll likely open keep vaccinating. It'll really hard parse extra transmission coming kids vs. adults comparing completely separate environments. Possibly unintentionally KiDs iMmUnE. diminishing infected. body better time deal it. based basic immunology tho, Covid still gaps knowledge blimp radar would likely pretty big blip. using nothing data generated contours one's face create ***unique key*** (possibly combined date/time vax serial#).. 

&amp;#x200B;

it's big brother sounds.

they ***need*** picture. need 20 25 ""coordinates""

hashed vax serial number whatever.. get unique key.

&amp;#x200B;

think millions people let faceID protect (access to) phones.

nudies one thing.

but face log banking app too.

&amp;#x200B;

biometrics strong enough Fed allow move money 

face/thumb scan makes sense. Devastating loss. 15 million doses... vaccinations 10-15% mark, vulnerable people protected, sure, nowhere near enough ""the threat basically biggie lose large numbers healthcare workers once"" sentiments. strange got from. Alot Yeah think anyone reasonably expects chances 0. wondering perhaps gotten sick second reached full effectiveness. That's true, whole last year live study many different hypothesis. figured transmission via surfaces, washed everything, ""masks work"". learned masks work, know exactly why. know least 2 different reasons masks work. glad scientists writing proving it. start larger process education everyone why, though hopefully vaccines too. uncld going get vaccinated sputik astrazeneca, first dosis. much wait gets antibodies?  Ugh know feel. day mixed garlic powder onion powder pantry completely ruined taco seasoning making. feel this. I’m still trying accept I’m fully vaccinated, it’s completely okay see vaccinated friends. Pretty sure got Covid back November hour spent every week watching bunch 4-5 year olds. Thankfully mild case give single person even though quarantine away 4 roommates. Right. wondering since likely exposed every day, would mean antibodies stay diminish regardless You’ll fine! soreness likely virus floats air suspended little droplets saliva, UV light destroy immediately. wonder studies look long virus survives open air shade temperature affects spelled name right give little love way. Pfizer.

&amp;#x200B;

These types study reporting random. sponsored supported Pfizer. Pfizer better game Moderna, startup commercial product vaccine. like lot better “11 days behind Italy” last year! 3 feet course, 16 17 get choice. Illinois dropping mask mandate CDC says to. full capacity bars staff mask time guests expected drinking. Every wedding state require masks. stores require masks. “Just rich”......well yes actually. 
Air travel large part commercial airline history reserved wealthy middle class. 
Why think people always talk “good’ol days” air travel. 

When seats tight cramped lot people would able afford air travel like today. Greyhound car. 

Airlines find sliver worth bearable! It’s also airlines stopped going bankrupt business like past! Look up. Airlines historically always lost money recently....which also coincides cheaper frills airfares include seat nothing else...and happened number people traveling United States world wide? They’ve increased highest levels ever. Air travel never accessible everyone worldwide currently is.....aka gave passengers (customers) wanted everyone could afford. 

Why making “absurd” assumption meant lie flat seats.......premiums seats you’d consider standard size seats.... pay extra them. 

I’m honestly interested airline 5’5” person leg issues... I’m 5’8” never issue flying coach....I’ve also never flown budget ultra low cost carrier...please answer one. 

Yes, right. Airlines charge every little thing gives customer choice want pay don’t.....this made air travel cheaper accessible ever before. Airlines wouldn’t eat cost amenities would include seat prices everyone would pay things. Even used/wanted/enjoyed not. also given group free-for-all, least neck woods. paper trail track it, let alone study it. patients come forward, guess might useful information. survey later on.  Since JNJ doses count first second doses actually multiply estimate two. like week half delay so.  bet even that. Welp dispell good info. affect vaccines already delivered still track vaccines needed. folks investigating see occurred. Could another factory make error? Probably  Many us, included, adament that. sub open everyone ask questions get answers. Closing sub subsection doubt never help convince solidify doubt. understand risks spreading coronavirus? Whoops. People die result. know that. Maybe four five days. We're getting close 3,000,000 daily average, time we're current Johnson Johnson doses might close 4,000,000 daily. bad probably ""weeks"" bad. Seems like yes no. one hand, could greatly reduce J&amp;J's shipments April maybe even May, planning switching using factory US supply. hand, Pfizer ahead schedule, Moderna looks like they'll soon able start pumping vaccines even faster. still track vaccines every adult end May, less leeway. Yeah think says section real numbers + extrapolating course correcting numbers actually posted. 

But super fun see scale shots. Every second, 4 Californians get shot. crazy logistics. article linked literally droplets hazard need take aerosols account creating COVID current official guidance personal protective equipment designed protect wearer droplets, infection spread aerosols considered risk caused medical interventions intubating patient.  facemasks provide inadequate protection aerosols staff safety increased widespread use specialised tight-fitting respirators (N95 FFP3 masks) increased indoor ventilation,"" Proffesor Tovey said.

 I'm assuming mean least six months. Right? No, that's far. keep stuff mind prepared there's another pandemic avoid going lockdown. I'm partially vaccinated. random walks past sidewalk sneezes, right demand proof vaccine status? grocery store get check vaccine passport letting decide whether need mask? Like get it, totally pandemic expecting people behave responsibly laughable, *especially* anti-vax anti-maskers plagued US whole pandemic. That's excellent news. happen link source? Thank They’re partying streets looking like January 2019. ""In South Africa, B.1.351 lineage prevalent 800 participants enrolled, nine cases COVID-19 observed, placebo group, indicating vaccine efficacy 100%,"" company said.

This fantastic news.

It's bit annoying thar efficacy dropped little 95 91%, may fluke would also grounds become mandatory many places, personally I'm opposed to. Keep masks public places little longer. There’s way tell glance who’s shot hasn’t. Even have, wear mask people’s peace mind. Mask wearing needs norm really virus run. don’t think anyone go far. able find silver linings - least identify past adversity inform future choices - pretty key coping mechanism ~~intellectuals~~ functional adults who’d like stay way. Pfizer even say this, made ""journalists"" Independent. US pharmaceutical company said new EU rules regarding free movement goods across borders hampering ability export vaccine. 

The administrative burden respect exports zero bearing production like headline suggest.
Also framing ""free movement goods"" dead giveaway nothing propaganda. never completely free movement goods across customs borders. minimum even FTAs customs declarations required. there’s bit feed. according Murray I'll wear mask winter idiots want get vaccinated. force get vaccinated instead forcing everyone wear damn mask?  population swells, deaths. broken later road. quarantine makes sense, would impossible enforce masks unvaccinated people. population swells, deaths. broken later road. Yeah counting authorities day come say ""It's safe now, whatever want""... well year shifting goalposts, learned one year (and counting)

Already goalpost shifting ""100% vaccination including children""

After going ""Once vaccine passport program rolled across states""

After going ""Due variants, vaccine passports 3 month validity renewal requires booster shots (by way, already NYC's works)""

After going ""It's good idea"" Moderna Girl! keeping COVID-related news last month (took break Reddit clear mind little bit). Israel right now? Sorry stupid question. David Able days??? There's lot nationalism seen, think means failure. Germany Marburg BioNTech mRNA vaccine plant capable producing \~1 billion mRNA doses every year.

Yeah, contracts say ""the first 160 million ours!"". 100% failure though? I'd say great Germany, along Belgium, Netherlands, many EU member states, able supply EU even large parts world vaccines. AZ South African variant, looks good. honestly think rural people traveled via rolling clinic something may cause think use China made vaccine. Wonder reason high cases None 13 children bleeding haemodynamically unstable required blood transfusion, **and child ITP died.**

I think big difference ... Az vaccine 10% effective south african strain anyways  see using extremely stupid false equivalencies arguing bad faith that's surosie. seems critical thinking surely something strong suited family. 

Which media outlets brought conclusion opinion vaccines?  really need figure way reach people mentally get vaccinated Chile Hungary use Sinopharm. crazy majority Germans believe can't vaccinated end Q3, even first dose.

They basically live parallel universe EU vaccine deliveries planned 2022, and/or government incompetent vaccinate population 6 months even abundance delivered doses.  global vaccination plan - it’s going well all.

So guarantee. well, wrong... Sono italiano pure io. Comunque scusa per averti taggato. washing hands everything else, still flu-like chance get Covid. washing hands reminded touched dirty contaminated things. Hard decisions. wish could give award, please anyone award comment, it’s important one. vaccines lead thromboses etc, rare etc 
also never many people vaccinated time! It’s it’s kinda expected know vaccines diseases.

It happens hard prove vaccine trials wasn’t focus back then.

Real data Israel already confirmed this. Basically could read article old Venice. knew half know still smarter many today's people. Hahahahahaha generally required. ""might"" still get able to. Ooooh tell direction I’m facing! seems necessary me, know anything Chicago parks. I'm defending headline. headline misleading. anyone took time read article they'd clearly see chance zero. Likely would worked fine, look WW2 army numbers Europe -- red army largest far.  mean replying comment clearly stating opposite? hundreds Teams Zoom meetings I’ve attended led past year, yet see one every attendee paying attention whole time. Since many people know, might already immune covid, vaccine required me? thread: ""france locking down""

You: ""they takin muh vaccines""  Sounds responsible haha Yes. good portions parks also closed recently well. still playgrounds equipment blocked off. concerned America really potential 4th wave? seems like cases rising vaccination rates improving they? Silent

Have ever met child? take people follow rules get vaccinated? disagree OPs choice words it’s inaccurate say immunologists expected initial efficacy results. level virus someone low nonexistent days exposure, it’s hard imagine would possess enough viral load exposure infect someone. science journalism community obviously skittish making assertions enough anecdotal evidence assume strongly (like amount viral load strong correlation outcomes) impossible read lines assume news would come. Wow, thanks stating obvious. Solid contribution. Silent deadly Playgrounds? That's later places.

Still, though, there's nothing stopping Timmy visiting Billy. That's people Covid bubbles. They're talking past year like kids spent solitary. likely reached. Still whether country opens based new number infected + test positivity ratio. Look US, Covid still claiming lots liven even though stand better Hungary. wearing shirt thing injecting foreign substances body? gotten vaccine, completely understand people hesitant, especially new. well, evidently 100% nowhere near 1% either, course, seen reports local media probably significant all, plain bad luck fringe cases.

I'm really worried, deal data: cards hand play better (even overkill). Well, Sinovac vaccine effective mild cases (78%), severe cases hospitalization (100%, probably less though, virtually 100% really possible guess!). based health care workers Brazil, substantial elderly people too. 

That means, turn COVID ""a little flu"", reducing deaths, transmission probably still happen (because 50% efficacy symptomatic, let alone asymptomatic...).

The thing is, guess vaccinate everyone, let coronavirus infect people, improve immune response. really big problem infecting coronavirus, people dying vaccinated IMO. fair you’re working insanely high risk setting likely treating unvaccinated people high viral loads. people’s exposure won’t multiple highly infectious people. also good data suggest breakthroufh infections vaccinated people infectious symptomatic, means asymptomatic spread could also eliminated reduced. everyone setting vaccinated exposure risk already relatively low, like store indoor dining, dynamics change. matter do, happen anyway bet. 12 since one dose Yeah. I’d like hear countries right/well. New Zealand news exemplary don’t hear Vietnam?   covid eventually turns lego, can't rule out! I’m confused CDC allows vaccinated people indoors without mask one household unvaccinated time. it’s safe CDC approved (who fully vaccinated) go door door without mask every house neighborhood, can’t invite two different neighbors hang time? messaging unclear. mean, Chicago kept playgrounds closed couple weeks ago. every flight flew pandemic basically full though, LA Boston Remove mask lipread. There's alternative lipreading. imagine age conditions. two read 80 many existing issues.

Already extremely rare clotting event (no risk factors, unusual location, almost unheard occur 18 year old) doctors could never confidently attribute anything. Multiple surgeries, almost 2 years warfarin + lovenox injections. sucks feeling like I've already shitty blood clot lottery condition rare literally worth anyone's time investigate risk factor anything covid vaccine related.

I blame people thinking reactions nothing. even even reading articles caring small risk personally experienced did. Beyond woman 30s known data feel completely alone dark comes understanding concerned feel. snap z formation typing sassy crap? 73 countries world entire population- Every man, woman, child- immunized amount vaccines lost mistake. Every single country smaller Somalia would able get completely immunized doses.

If interpret vaccine that's 100% effective preventing deaths, estimate 1% infected people die, would hypothetically 150,000 deaths. Obviously numbers anywhere near easy, God damn, pretty big loss international community. doses almost certainly meant export. Sure risk transmission vaccination nonzero, vaccine provides 90% reduction risk think qualms going back normal life. 90% reduction far better cloth masks likely achieve! would merely avoid contact vulnerable immunocompromised unvaccinated elderly people. Damnit.. we're trying. JHU. even things out? mild symptoms almost 10 admitted hospital. that’s definitely case. it’s good example 99.9% anything still remainder go untouched. people represent 0.1% like germs stay hand using sanitizer kills 99.9% germs.  Yeah, sountries closed borders Brazil P1 variant You’re vaccinated. Don’t complain, happy fully protected severe disease death strongly protected sort infection. That's pretty much article arguing. means vaccines 100% efficacious infections? Well, might true 70% close enough 100%. sure trying conscientious citizen increase virus's transmission range turns Typhoid Mary unknowingly carrying it? got second dose vaccine, one healthcare workers stated everyone room that;

1. efficacy vaccine fully mature 2 weeks second dose
2. efficacy rating 95% Moderna vaccine(the one got)
3. take medication like ibuprofen immediately affect vaccine, take Tylenol. believe 3-5 day window ibuprofen.
4. two weeks up, anyone else also vaccinated indoors without masks without issues, HOWEVER, even ONE person unvaccinated/unknown status, masks required everyone

Obviously ""required"" used sense ""highly recommended/encouraged"". People whatever want end day anyway. 551 k today. Yes!  Got first shot today! Thank you. That’s trying point article misleading.

Team Rhino way Yep mild, thankfully! responded another comments up-to-date source showing increasing hospitalizations. Also, think person downvoted top-line comment specifically moving conversation away that. Every company different. friend's job instituted ""covid days"", anyone positive covid test result (or someone household) get 10 days PTO separate normal PTO. 

And think said ""double dip"" if, example, kid gets it...then later get it. 

But friends places...they get nothing. sure hell seems like it. Hospitals overwhelmed anymore old people vaxxed, justifications restrictions point malicious. Hopefully done crap next 6 months. well deserved vacation planned Summer. ask backdate fake vacations, instead FWD HR request vacation carried forward new year guarantee (signed, writing) able schedule vacation Q1-Q2 following year :-)

They'll love forgoing vacation BS literally like handing $$$ back company. What's hourly rate x 80? (-tax) lost losing 2 weeks. depending value time vs. $$$ Yeah preCovid making fun nurses like normal. Especially antivax variety. think individual level things profoundly different two weeks dose 2. much much less fear. societal level lag get fully vaccinated, Labor Day think society look almost indistinguishable 2019. Pfizer's clinical trials reflect data see UK. reduces transmission, extent trials claim. sloppiness though? feel like lot negative press without much evidence support it. 

The UK leading charge use AZ seen infection rates fall 4K day death rates averaging low 50, 1500 month ago! 

If successful don’t know is. Commission indeed took basically moment agreement signed never superseded it’s contract signed 14th August applicable 27th August. Apes too, together strong. Interesting information! Thanks sharing in-depth response. There’s reason think ever need take shot again. There’s also evidence show won’t. seems unlikely immunity would last one year. don’t think vaccines last one year. need flu vaccine every year virus mutates lot, way antibodies one strain largely ineffective another. far least (and remember it’s year), SARS-CoV-2 variants mutated way. vaccines developed original strain work almost well variants. Well, lot low information folks, sure. right? cringey every time see people saying 'oh america doomed, shithole country', time waltz grocery store buy vegan egg scramble within 10 minutes. spend 30 minutes country like india people realize good here. source: spent year india. absolute shitty infrastructure widespread destitution, terrible see think EU implemented EU first policy like USA/UK? said Mitch McConnell contributed?

It'd nice America could embrace like Asian counties decades, guess enough ""patriots"" prevented that. think I'll reserve judgement closer August (or maybe even Labor Day), truly give everyone time vaccinated doses, yeah I'm going mental breakdown can't get back normal then. interim, encouraging fully vaccinated people get lives  sure varies person person I’m vaccine expert (immunology researcher vax specific), guideline get one every 10 years whenever potentially exposed 10 years may start decline protection exposed get one better safe sorry. sure means 1 year booster, step rusty nail, means definitely give booster agreement tetanus shot confer lifelong immunity better safe sorry toxin extremely terrible exposed Wish tech savory data also show cells fight naturally well new strains. i’m likely get second time  make combination shots like viruses? know one diptheria/a bunch bacteria whatever testing, especially over-the-counter tests authorized today, important part country’s pandemic response—many schools, workplaces, communities, entities setting testing programs quickly screen COVID-19.

Although get others’ point that, random minimum wage worker know you’re vaccinated. guess makes sense wait 70% population vaccinated drop mask rules private businesses. Lol AZ vaccine 10% effective? Nice trolling. hospital 5 less ICU. I'm getting Pfizer shot Sunday b/c appointment available I've already told boss look Monday...and maybe Tuesday. Insane overreaction. can’t believe they’ve gone route. citizens must really frustrated. EU waste time cheap. per capita basis, Germany alone spent twice US spent vaccine development. addition EU EU countries spent spent Covax boycotted Trump administration. Show studies effectiveness masks vs viral infections. Everything new here. new virus, new vaccine method (mRNA), new virus situation (an entire world exposed new coronavirus first time, presenting us new variants &amp; hybrid scenarios). new variants &amp; hybrids likely impact long vaccines last. scientists learning things unfold real-world, real-time case study. 1) People trivializing virus way (it's like flu, young people immune, need mass exposure natural herd immunity ala chickenpox, etc.) fools. 2) Count blessings vaccine even exists instead whining long vaccine lasts. 3) continue learning experience rest lives learn long-term effects adults kids learn long-term effects contracting young (will manifest something like shingles get old? persist like Lyme disease?) fear mongering, talking vaccines. early reports efficacy current crop vaccines P.1 encouraging.

Like, low key actually miss lmao Well luckily conversation improved vaccines already part society getting one - however don’t expect offered future better ones proper supply certainly hope it’s friends family’s turn get better ones onset going anywhere, anything, providing payment establishment requires vaccine passport. really don’t think reason banning vaccine statistical significance. leaning towards spat AZ also political issues brexit playing role decisions here. wow, south leading way! agreement basically one page term sheet actually anything, especially IVA negotiate EU. rest EU also pissed it. real agreement 27 Aug: Unfortunately, no. usually technically doable (cashing vacation time) I’ve seen kind thing discouraged makes managers look bad avoid whenever possible. mean, vaccine actually distributed decent chunk people, there’s absolutely reason keep restrictions place. vaccines turn last long, variant evolves immunity vaccines, put restrictions back place. good keep place interim. [Trump signed president order back December blocking export (until Americans vaccinated)

More recently, [Biden blocked exports raw impacting production capacity primarily India Yikes. Glad live EU then. addition comment wrong 200 different ways, fascinating see claim ""hurts"" pretend everything fine when, actually, hurts lot acknowledge reality. 1. Covid eradicated UK.  
2. Don’t compare small island nations anyone else stated another response you, Mr. Bourla's statement completely consistent said: Regular booster shots *may* necessary based future evidence waning immune response. trial provides evidence immune response significantly diminished 6 months. immune response remains vigorous next 6 months, presumably one require booster every year. AZ already working booster jab expected ready Sept doubt need mix. Even need mix would want uncontrolled studies millions people? Sounds like madness! yet recent studies say yes vaccines protect P1 well…. Stop fear mongering. good. vaccine acceptance rate abysmally low there? 2nd lowest country. got first AZ last week bullshit. hope get second time june. US refusing export vaccines materials vaccine production, EU exporting half produces. think EU follow US example halt vaccine exports? bad side effects 2nd Moderna shot. want every 6 months. mean will, ugh, hope to. saying? Would suck 1.5%. reason need get herd immunity, means getting anti-vaxxers take it. live spanish flu. Every year season flu contains strains spanish flu, humans gotten used dangerous initially. you’re vaccinated - are, still give them.

There magic shield vaccine. efficacy rate - screw fall outlier group? go school coronavirus, it’s indisputable college nowhere near fun year. German/EU propaganda. Jesus even like Brits (being Irish) I'm bored it. entire Northeast going back up. Got first Pfizer dose today. Also got free Krispy Kreme donut! bad experience. HR department sent notice out:

[that’s understand original comment says war covid thanks vaccination.

The next comment says next problem anti-vax - it’s true. reason measles still around thanks anti-vax movements.

The next usual “well fuck em then” sentiment.

The one replied correctly says leave get infected, vector new mutations.

You bring mink mutation anything trying ensure maximum vaccination rates humans.

Of course would effect possible mutation rates animals. Well, aside fact reducing spread humans also definition reduce chances spread dealing head idea unvaccinated people lepers.

No weren’t. comment chain comes anywhere near sentiment third comment - bringing potential mutation anti-vax populations fact counter-argument “well fuck em, let get infected. ""Won't somebody think children!""  

Scientists working feverishly clinical trials 12-16 year-olds younger children thereafter. perfect world everyone would safely approved now, course.  

With 65-70% adult population vaccinated, kids extremely low risk serious illness, much less viral spread like they've seen past year. Sit tight, they'll get shots soon. School look much different '21-'22. trial haha 

Cause there’s one put press release saying dosed people March 10th. they’re testing bunch different stuff idk what’s anymore That's good know. Well event mentioned new data may make change mind. answer question depends define “deadlier”. article dealing mortality rate entire population (not get infected). Vaccines reduce number people get infected. less people got vaccinated flu, would flu deaths, lethality flu wouldn’t change (which would another possible definition “deadliness”). I’m suck LA smogs dick Going crass here, apologies. would think really low immeasurable, usually takes longer two weeks get sick enough die Covid. free, US government paid them. right, eventually people going pay boosters like pay flu shots. mother also get it. insane. father get second shots. free now, US government paying them, right: eventually people pay them. That’ll vaccines you. Hopefully two guys charge testing either iPad delayed 😒 Conservative news coopted term fearmonger domestic matters. Vaccine passports international travel discussed months. Totally agree you. Like past, children survived horrific wars. Famines. today, children can't survive year home parents, plenty food high-tech entertainment. 102 cases 1,000,000 vaccinated people. one saying vaccine 100% effective. one open questions whether vaccinated people spread virus without symptoms. need worried ~10% still get sick everyone vaccinated still potentially spreading virus? R0 &lt;&lt; 1 people vaccinated vaccinated people unlikely spread virus exposure. vaccinated people become asymptomatic carriers capable spreading virus, may linger much longer. wife Moderna trial, get booster ""late summer"". boss told can’t get vaccine blood type O-negative could fuck up. I’m doctor though, don’t know accurate is. buy goldfish groceries midnight. I...I.... thought premise vaccine normally.. Pretty childish perspective. That's like saying, ""There viruses like COVID-19!"" Well, are. question going light reality live in. J&amp;J 66% max efficacy one dose.

This quite right, increases time. seem remember 49 63 days post vaccination really high efficacy. Thank one first comments I've ever seen reddit expressing genuine appreciation vaccination companies. swear god, companies singlehandedly pull us pandemic like $18 shot ever hear bad pharmaceutical companies are!!! Unbelievable. Nope, boyfriend, already COVID. wouldn’t surprised isn’t anxiety - know I’m still freaked despite vaccinated. also imagine she’ll change mind things proceed. mentioned open cabin trip friends later summer closer Labor Day, imagine last. :)

I shared anecdote say “hey people don’t think vaccine change lives much” still added flippant remark, didn’t mean make people upset. Yeah statistics work. feet reach floor last time flew 135lbs. Maybe try better argument accusing fat. needs top comment Assuming ever get there. I'm concerned Israel's vaccine drive completely stalled. tasteful, get upvoted. not, people bury it. efficacy hoping for, vaccine 50%.

The mRNA finishing thier trials first high efficacy . made vaccines look bad comparison.  16+ eligible April 6th. Even reason he's two days early compared eligibility. Probably concerns people taking vaccine cause know things return normal one way other. 550 million doses, vaporware like doses promised Europe never received? 
Whaaat....? please source one me? US supplying vaccines European Union countries (Pfizer J&amp;J relatively quiet per article above, suspect keeping supplies mostly domestic government gives okay). Additionally well, EU far heavily reliant Astra Zeneca vaccine, fair share issues bad press. 

I'm defending US actually, agree stop doses vaccine sent anywhere, also think fair somewhat skeptical Russian motivations here. point say actual drop bucket vaccines actually order Brazil, Russians publicizing make US big bad boogie man. 

If want criticize US, need informed specific. Let give examples. US specifically Biden administration refused take action previously granted authorities lift intellectual property protections existing vaccines (Pfizer Moderna foremost, among others). protected patents, like factory India start pumping formula recreate one RNA vaccines, Pfizer's one. instead licensed Pfizer, done Pfizer; Pfizer also ask whatever want price terms receiving countries (such Brazil). lucky live advanced enough country government afford pay Pfizer's asking price, great-- tax dollars (or insert currency) put work. not? bad-- playing rules capitalism far vaccine developing companies concerned. world fully vaccinated sometime late next year 2023.

See? That's give proper criticism current US vaccine policy, stuff fluff.  IIRC, think 90 days, get another vaccine different type, confirm primary care provider.

Did worry manufacturer made boosters vaccines, yearly flu shot? course not. There's nothing *really* known would prevent mixing boost prime doses different manufacturers, trials using one dose AZ Pfizer. hope ways, remember picked one go first randomized. hope randomized. title misleading. Well, say businesses able ask vaccine pass anti-science people like it, leave house.

Didn't get vaccine went hospital? Sorry insurance got dropped due reckless behavior. problem might... cure cannot find anyone answer I'd super appreciate someone knows answer shed insight. CDC says someone 2 weeks past second dose Pfizer/Moderna 'fully vaccinated'. Someone 2 weeks past J&amp;J also fully vaccinated. Pfizer Moderna 92% efficacy first dose (and 94% second dose), J&amp;J 66% max efficacy one dose. full vaccination, CDC provided set guidelines follow safe. example, say people fully vaccinated see indoors without mask, like 'normal'. 

Why Earth unsafe someone 92% efficacy (aka someone 2 weeks past first Pfizer/Moderna shot) socialize normally vaccinated people, whereas someone 66% efficacy (2 weeks J&amp;J), CDC-approved permission see people indoors without mask?

Flaws logic like make think something wrong. unethical, literally sacrifices immunocompromised cannot vaccinated real medical conditions, sake MuH FrREeDoMs. supposed 11M JNJ delivered week US (they apparently actually manufactured Netherlands...). Status less Children don’t die virus. needs stop new thing now. Daily reminder article posted states agreement import Sputnik V 10 million doses fraction 550 million doses Brazil contract year Pfizer Inc. Johnson &amp; Johnson

This also vaccine approved undergoing sufficiently rigorous testing (phase 3). That's gonna dog. probably immune protection point. Personally I’d rather get vaccine get sick yeah it’ll probably mild next time. either police get bunch people lying, right? yet, fully folk actually catching Covid. really true. though? may Netherlands aiming 2,5 million vaccines week eligible population roughly 13 million. Thats 5+ times current speed. One 3(?) organizations vaccinations say currently 1 million + week due lack supplies rouglhy quarter that. Supplies rise rapidly april may. adults 18+ vaccinated july first according calculations done version nhs (2/3 fully, 1/3 one two jabs). get amount vaccines rest Europe, proportional population. bit behind US UK weeks/months. course everything goes according plan, probably won't, said USA UK. evil EU leaders forced UK export vaccines rest world exported +30 million countries /s.

Damned EU making Boris seem like a-hole. got second PFIZER shot today. wonderful news. kind operations in? Sex toy manufacturing something? fear-mongering. Teens still get it. People 30s 40s die time. 10-30% become long-haulers living serious symptoms may go away. Wearing mask social distancing lot ask. Keeping everyone chance get vaccinated much ask. next election 2022, unfortunately. Suit Quarantine passports allow treat unvaccinated people like second class citizens? That’s thing tend agree. Extend olive branch getting vaccinated dont give fuck.

Fortunately theres currently limiting factor via supply, loss really everyone else's gain right now. Every unvaccinated anti vaxxer another vaccine someone else willing it. I'm able find source thinking (apparently standard tests give disclaimer pick vaccine antibodies), idea vaccine generates antibodies spike protein natural infection generates antibodies ... [something else.]. former if, effective, picked standard test. Looks like may hit miss bright line though upon research.

Here sources support this, direct way remember vaccinated person likely get negative result serology test, even vaccine successful protective. That’s different serology tests detect antibodies different parts virus.

Some tests detect antibodies spike protein virus, produced response viral infection vaccine. Others detect antibodies different part virus called nucleocapsid protein, produced response infection, current happened read says contract manufacturer J &amp; J vaccine US ruined 15 million doses human error (I would like person), doses already distribution affected, made different facility, Netherlands. 

J &amp; J started deliveries EU members yet - that's supposed begin end month - stuff delivering US made Europe. said days ago.  it?  Fertility means whether conceive not. 

You're referring something else entirely. caused pregnant women getting infected virus damaging fetus. pregnant infertile. office declined provide details, including numbers outdoor infections identified contact tracing much increased.

Stopped reading right there. Garbage article.  Teams meetings potential clients, maybe engaging could get vaccine... immunodeficiency disease well, genes. much better older though, still good someone else age still effective. wonder though would stand covid worrying. yeah kid would sick time simple illnesses one time even flatlined moment. I've seen lots articles posted Reddit, I'm sure find them... Yeah, too. annual flu shot usually little uncomfortable. Pfizer vaccine shot - nothing. Amazing. difference. government people pushed this, Federal Govt. threw huge allotment them, allowing punch vaccinating everyone rapidly.

And also Navajo fucked virus harder anyone else Earth. people needed this. you’re saying there’s comparison /s comments little, anything, article devolved unrelated mask arguments. see that's possible without vaccinating children, we're yet. much wrong justifying lying public ""for good"".

We literally got rid Trump guy lied like 10k times. would okay another politician lying you? 

It okay Trump it. okay Fauci can't figure truth either. Lol, Florida literally comparison problems Michigan/NY/NJ faced March/April. mean that's true. vaccines would bene produced somewhere, regardless whether EU thing. HI PLEASE HELP.

It people refuse wear masks get vaccine ones spreading around themselves.

A bit justice. Sucks cases people can't get vax due medical issues though. eliminate EU. I'm fairly confident impossible.

That means 2.5-7.5 months second dose saw 68 casrs vaccinated vs 681 placebo. read efficacy dropped 95% first 2.5 months 90% months Sorry hear cancer. receiving chemotherapy another treatment? respond vaccine? True, people vaccinated refuse ""it's 100% safe"" ""Astrazeneca causes blood clots"" ""why risk? choice"". 28 healthcare workers 29 refused it, likely underlying conditions?

Also, be, healthcare workers medical conditions prevent taking vaccine (or delay it).

 Even people simply want (and underlying conditions) first sent work less risky department there's need sent home (but get vaccine, never beyond December 2021) buddy already got vaccinated got positive test back taking care infected family. Given Modern similar, would safe say offers similar protection (that's vaccine have)? Proof please real-world performance better...I'm seeing 70% vs 95% Pfizer Moderna. Pfizer keeps getting COVID. AZ keeps hospital, keep getting/possibly spreading it. side effects indeed miniscule, PERCEPTION among already timid skittish deer-like Japanese public means nowhere NEAR enough people going take end pandemic, therefore quarantine requirements. way anyone real job able leave country come back...it'll two-week quarantine summer 2022. seems like J&amp;J issue yesterday nothingburger terms timelines delivering doses 15 million doses trashed already known about.

This clearly isn’t true. 

I wonder they’re pissed Biden’s team undermining talking point. Good news long countries aren’t vaccinating, ecosystems virus eventually mutate new strain come take us out. source says produced, spoiled. allegra Croatian article things observed, study, ok? post then? magical vaccines sitting around nothing? 

EU approved Pfizer Christmas, AZ 3 weeks application, J&amp;J already approved.

EU stop-and-start precautionary approach either. individual countries' decisions halt AZ. understand downvotes. agree still wear mask grocery stores/doctors offices/etc around people everyone chance ge vax. i'm taking boyfriend 2 weeks second doses (so early May) INDOOR dining place celebrate Wait read percentage people die covid.. looked China stats, highest death rate peak (feb 2020) 150 deaths day, joke reporting I'm voted asking benign question? Thanks reddit! also heard anyone vomiting shot heard people vomiting sick covid would take chances vaccine. enough time passed. expected last longer, though possible effectiveness would decline somewhat time. likely effectiveness would go 91% 6 months 20% 7 months example, gradual decline possible. 

With time know much declines. It’s several weeks since Fauci others announced variant crossed 50% cases threshold. 

The variant new new America. It’s dominant awhile now. “Data suggests”: this? Ancient Aliens? Lmao that’s even close works. wife minor side effects first, none second. brave you! legit gave definition word. Im antivax bc common sense. idiot thinking helps out. supposed made end 2021. beginning. reason talking you. 
Your volunteering kill letting change dna. Global supply hampers manufacturers cannot export vaccines US, UK. 

That impacts supply vaccines countries know. US one bought them.  Yeah, beware inevitable coming headlines ""scientists unsure protection last 6 months.""

3 minths ago lots headlines ""scientist unsure protection lasts beyond 3 months.""


Yes... gotten far enough say definitively, reason suspect last. Yes, research funded Americans America. Drew Weissman important mRNA portion. Nationwide increase new cases pretty small. vaccine everyone going back outside, imagine potential new wave lower ceiling. Gotcha, thanks! Man, must outlier thread. I've worked multiple jobs many different bosses course 20 years widely varying sectors, construction, retail, food service, office, IT. Never issues people say, took plenty sick days years. think US finally seeing action variants, least that's what's going Canada many countries worldwide. data emerging, vaccine appears heavily reducing transmission. means most, nearly all, new cases likely unvaccinated people (including people enough time post vaccination create antibodies getting exposed--it takes couple weeks protection build).

Coming spring warming temps we'd expected cases decline things equal. totally let take sick day provided harm deadlines.

But, absolutely nothing help cover absence end taking kind hit taking time off. Since seem answers, clarify logistics 12 week lock us? surface seems wildly impractical. 

Who cares sick? Doctors nurses? Surely work. get work? Cars? car breaks? Surely need mechanics. take public transportation? need bus train operators. need maintenance people hospitals. get work.

All people eat, farmers, grocery store workers, truck drivers, manufacturers essential. folks manage systems.

Hospitals consume electricity water natural gas. folks necessary, too. also eat, poop, drink water, presumably commute work.

So perhaps take minute ponder scope complexity system delivers goods services allow exist comfortable bubble advocating silly, shallow thought ideas like ""12 week lockdown now?""

Unless answer question ""how deliver goods services necessary continue exist without requiring anyone work?"" so, awarded Noble Prize Economic research! Whoa.

Still can't find info regarding potential risk vaccinating covid positive. ideas? disagree covid precautions, restrictions, masks, fear last decade? Imagine guy this.

I believe Moderna mostly used USA now, IIRC. Yes sir. clear enough seems. 

My bad. 

Any suggestions improve it? first person receives first dose 8 months ago, would data 6.5 months (takes 6 weeks immunity develop).

Also, takes months get participants dosed. It’s rolling process, don’t give everyone doses day takes time get statistically significant group size. side effects yet hours. Hope feel better soon. wish, Biden make quid pro quo. “We give vaccines, open borders.” We're talking nurses vaccinations, comments justified. Get chip shoulder, debate nurses general value importance. bring random article medical procedure misscariage treated even agreed procedure would led becoming one, understand word sterile mean, ofc randomly relevant. ""and others"" big factor.

Until reach significant levels vaccination, policies public spaces going set assuming people *aren't*.

Obviously whatever want private settings. Unfortunately AP ran “up to” statement. really edit headline. CNN, USA Today, NBC, etc used “at least” 6 months. Fwiw, think whoever tweeted surely must thought logistics must date science transmission understand risks probabilities stack make safe vaccinated people sit couple seats apart outdoor event. literally can't think safer activity involve either going nature people, never leaving house eternity. People people would interesting find one nasal cavity, definitely found mouth saliva before. understand relevance international travel, especially post-pandemic. Plus many countries different mask requirements. use fmla unpaid leave medical conditions. this. agree true, that's outdated advice. recommendation avoid vaccination within 90 days receiving monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma. 

Here's CDC themselves: 

**People prior current SARS-CoV-2 infection**

Data clinical trials indicate currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines given safely people evidence prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. People offered vaccination regardless history prior symptomatic asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral testing assess acute SARS-CoV-2 infection serologic testing assess prior infection recommended purposes vaccine decision-making.

Vaccination people known current SARS-CoV-2 infection deferred person recovered acute illness (if person symptoms) met criteria discontinue isolation. recommendation applies people experience SARS-CoV-2 infection receiving vaccine dose experience SARS-CoV-2 infection first dose mRNA vaccine receipt second dose.

**While recommended minimum interval infection vaccination**, current evidence suggests risk SARS-CoV-2 reinfection low months initial infection may increase time due waning immunity. Thus, vaccine supply remains limited, people recent documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may choose temporarily delay vaccination, desired, recognizing risk reinfection and, therefore, need vaccination, might increase time following initial know whole fucking comment guess/ comment made clear...like isn’t fucking university fucking press briefing... fucking tool. talking I've commented posts say going case based prior data vaccines.

[Funded billion dollars US Johnson &amp; Johnson [In cant say lasts year year. ""it's 6 months, still working!"" eventually like flu shot? Annually? protections like too. Well, get goddamn Internet. Humans evolve wifi packet switching. Internet destroys human communication proper posture. There's reason humans born without ethernet cards.

The rest us here, enjoying benefits science technology. CDC said yesterday fully-vaccinated people can't spread virus, therefore longer need wear masks. took 3 days dose 2 employer say boo. ""At least"" 6 months mean ""only"" 6 months. means still working 6 months, implications beyond that. Yeah, ever read anything related vaccines Twitter watching people talking efficacy numbers completely misunderstanding numbers mean interpret can't compare Facebook private platform. ban whoever like 1st amendment issue. must missed whole anti-mask thing  Oh see.

You meant ""You can't reaction vaccine without producing antibodies""

Not ""You can't reaction vaccine unless already antibodies""

Right? Well, used stupid... self employed turn monkeys I'm sure we'll see next 100 million doses .... We've never passports flu, never problem. Calling permanent flu passports virus that's around 100 years effective treatments pure insanity. put context, 15 million doses put single production line 2-4 weeks, depending line speed. plant multiple lines running, could make even faster. isn’t likely create supply issue itself. larger issue root cause “mixup” remediation implemented. ends root cause larger implications, could put batches danger. issue small number batches, quick fix, small “speed bump” supply plant. 

Source: pharma engineering consultant depends definition 'severe'. I've read studies, fever would considered 'severe'. (I heard J&amp;J, know classify severe) Awesome! got first shot Pfizer vaccine hours ago! Good luck lol Exactly, even US specific thread, even were, there’s wide disparity state state rollout schedules! litetally vaccine disease 100% effective contracting transmitting disease asymptomatically. technically vaccinated measles still contract spread it. fact matter real world data currently highly vaccinated populations Israel UK suggests 90% efficacy rate asymptomatic transmission, better ever could dreamed certainly good better existing vaccine. unless suggesting everyone wear masks social distance forever eliminate incredibly miniscule chance vaccinated person transmitting possible disease, zero reason fully vaccinated individuals continue social distancing wearing masks private gatherings (I support continuing wearing masks public everyone wants one chance receive vaccine, though). No, 6 months keep watching see long works. cant say lasts year actually watch people who've full year. way implication stop working 6 months. goes show money indicate intelligence. Omg thought weird sticky sub, thanks reminding date. Jab Shove (In Wanna (Forget Vaccination) really understand effff up! like they're mixing chemicals hand. Everything automated. They'd literally mislabeling agents actual shipping containers they're arriving in. FDA better step see kind operation J&amp;J running. One would think employers would rather employee 1 2 days due side effects 2 whole weeks due Covid. Except matter pace vaccine rollout come dramatic rise hospitalizations death. purpose vaccine make immune system stronger so, no, getting rid viruses use vaccine destroy immune system. Approval highly likely, ~end April. Yeah don’t ... follow CDC guidelines source ""the CDC says masks reduce infections 0.5 percent""? try find data website, [it tells different fun scaring people without evidence Hopefully concerns ""reports"" end wrong, past performance indicate future performance time around. ok studies show us vaccine prevents transmission. would necessary that? Kept hustling long it’s yourself!!! information whether vaccine prevents long term effects. Thats exactly know whether people immune them. 

Yes, people suffering long term Covid sometimes feel better getting vaccine. research awesome? 

I need exit conversation now. Hope good day.  say sounding like we'll need annual shots? possible, finding way evidence need yearly boosters. Still happens. course it’s relevant. don’t culture impact trust doctors. sure it’s anything laugh about. took pfizer side effects shit Jokes you, I’m male stripper Sorry speak America, tides turning. governor calls lockdown one follows it, really happen? major country done better vaccination purchasing us US, that's Moderna Pfizer US companies. government realised MRNA vaccines would hoarded US wisely invested heavily AZ. government done better vaccine recruitment, US literally would allow us MRNA. contracts US sign simply ban exports, massively limit ability Moderna Pfizer spread resources across pond, especially Moderna. 

It's question competence effort, simply US policy power change. Biden interest helping UK. like Johnson, strong Irish identity, desperate prove stronger China Trump. US foreign policy less eurocentric next years. golden opportunity US increase influence developing world currency vaccines. 

The roadmap certainly extended give AZ, give AZ probability roadmap extended significantly decreases. Based probabilities, makes far sense vaccinate AZ now. roadmap factors need booster. Whitty said today probability us going back lockdown even cases rose significantly low. certainty anything, probability, probability current approach chance succeeding, based likelihood AZ vaccine provide protection severe illness variants. end month we’ll look back point small blip downward trajectory.

That said, next week still suck articles talking 4th wave. people already won’t let phase them. guess government push incentive get vaccinated. Doesn’t 1 somewhat effect efficacy they’re given close other?  Whoops. Didn’t get good summary one! about: caught cold employee came sick. called Monday. Tuesday showed masked grabbed stuff work home. wanted get covid test could return, meanwhile sick employee office working. get test want know returned work yet. working home test results yet. Somehow bad guy going work test results back.

The employee took covid test working office waiting results, eyes makes look bad. can't comprehend stupidity office manager this. talked boss agreed one work office waiting results. 
How many mRNA vaccines made past animal test phase Covid vaccines given emergency use authorization? Yet another example physicians keeping new information. That's terrible idea. chance vaccine resistant mutation foregone conclusion people US would surely die result move. would also little lower chances mutations scheme things. Everyone wants get back normal ASAP, people care situation Agreed Or...stay here...the statement objective fact like ""98% infected COVID survive"" that...a statement fact. nothing dismissing danger, statement fact. Yeah mean that's obviously fair decision EU good either. today, saying EU vaccinating fast enough risks hotbed variants. time take measures get vaccines, whether importing doses India putting controls exports seen horrible? 

It annoys see people talking sides mouth. Either export bans ok protect population vaccine export bans bad disadvantage make vaccines. truth say. healthy kids spend hours internet every day. like vac. Honestly, don’t mind 6 month booster given it’s protecting against. wanna catch implication vaccine lasts 12 months. think varies. [I've read range efficacy first dose Pfizer Moderna 52% - may average 80%? exactly know - really asking anyone seen data this, Health Canada winging it.  imagine cop that's power trip coming asking papers... Starbucks baristas think skinny-french-vanilla-mociato contain 1 pump vanilla, two. Seeing already variants likely similar needing flu shots every year. casualty rate likely bit higher 25,000 plus year US flu. world community done hard shutdown isolation/masks immediately year ago wouldn’t death toll maybe wouldn’t any, least many, serious mutations. Thanks, makes sense me! 

I'd curious know response level correlation demographics prior health conditions, etc. 

Like among 10/100 vaccinated contracted virus, could predicted still higher risk, seemingly random subsample clear patterns? That’s take away comment? even close...the science done vaccines amazing. science takes time. 

People choice wait choice impact career...especially things going rolling out

Call crazy pain butt fly damn passport. get delivery distribution level flu vaccine I'd fine yearly booster.

It pretty much already there. vials longer need kept special freezers.  must great year surrounded people dismissing COVID even remotely dangerous ""98%/99% survive"" year combatting covid deniers fully supportive mitigation efforts, even I'm ready open. I'm fully vaxxed Monday want things before, without dystopian rules (concerts example). Understandably flip switch, think vaccines eligible need allow people make choices again. hope uptick severely limited vaccination effort good summer. give much boss government I'm good leaving country everyday life cant wait abused municipalities wannabe cops asking papers. [reported booster shots would need lengthy testing, hopeful might available late summer. Well documented proof way penalized jury duty major crime school district would facing **SERIOUS** legal ramifications.  gym year either. took VR work VR now.. weights obviously fair amount cardio I'm hoping least sub remains somewhere read long term studies arise with. Things like, seeing many faces affected infants year? learned coronaviruses? mRNA vaccines? Etc.  FREEDOM™ countries hate Great place wash money you’re poor housewife know guy named Rio. vaccines got young basically one done whole life, *hopefully* 1 year? vaccine blueprints make antibodies COVID vaccine. Presumably shouldn’t tremendous side effects later date. 

And also COVID seems long term side effects including lung scarring, kidney failure, myocarditis. mean, you’re really concerned long term side effects, still would probably want err side vaccine, no? actually get immunity turning giant coronavirus.

Hope like rolling around everywhere. 50m surplus vaccine now, time crank it!  That's thinking know do, don't. know living, imagine doctor epidemiologist coming place work saying ""I worry might work optimal way."" laugh them. good reason.  I'm claiming cover-up, I'm sure country free press would possible. Romanians rest Europe? key words ""at least"" I'm willing bet longer that. I've lost essentially faith World Health Organization. serve almost purpose preventative actions developed nations point. still think they're useful developing countries, act like they're helpful entire world makes look awful, ridiculous.

I think considered charity anything. reading comment, World Health Organization probably acting behalf. country probably organizations fill function better job. I'm getting frustrated listening constantly lambast nations fund them- Except China, course- giving nations absolutely nothing legitimate benefit return. helping us need stop acting like are. EU literally signed contract one day UK did. That's issue. AZ underdelivering. replied comment saying nurses anti-science taking covid vaccine. However, covid vaccine authorized emergency use standard trails vaccines authorized normal use had. Furthermore, nurse's demographic contains lot young females want kids, process trying get kids pregnant. anti-science demographic want take covid-19 vaccine due vaccine tested demographic. relieved &amp; nervous. relieved know won’t get seriously ill, everyone else returns normal, kids high risk ones super careful. can’t wait community infections drop relax little. pictured, like....an ice-cream truck, vaccines. Driving around playing tinny little jingle, cartoon superheroes punching viruses painted side. also entire country Israel's data work with? would probably cut labor force store hours keep business alive pandemic. get select appointment? get choose three different vaccines, day time slot. certain point benefits restrictions small worth cost. worry experts focused zero risk ""defeating virus"" make us suffer longer necessary. US better rely AZ right export ban. ""haggling"" put issue Pfizer delivering doses initially ordered actually fulfilling sign contract first presumably entitled earliest deliveries

The EU signed contract one day UK did. issue contract, AZ overpromised can't meet demand customers time. Ummm ... yeah, completed. mean guess. call propaganda suggesting live life ""in fear."" whole pandemic made realize digusting things important wash hands disinfect belongings get home. 

Hope makes sense. Dated nurse. believed conspiracies pretty hard core. They're always bright. Married? Kids? Retirement? curious guess... feel like things end screwing things up. God, hope put you’re black belt CV. Sure don’t want anyone miss opportunity. got 2 shots Pfizer side effects. 34 old Male bad imune system. Thats got shot Early. even joined research / study effects vaccine lowered imune system. take tests first shot. 2 months 6 months after. Checking effects vaccine. 

That said might get side effects. tell went fine vaccine. still Wear mask behave like havent got vaccine. feel save. Kinda disappointed bill gates mind control chip last 6 months. like windows launch again. Yeah, right, scrap whole vaccine thing. We're acting far rash.


.... wtf many countries aiports open Brazilians 
this variant? ""Avoid non-essential activities"" != ""12 Week Lockdown now.""

This conjecture Christmas 4th July, know, fun stuff, seems less likely spread COVID19 number things actually essential collective survival modernity, like food manufacturing plants, e-commerce distribution centers, medical facilities, public transportation based population density social bubble overlap, lack better term it. year pandemic, data back too! 

The fact people debate year pandemic alarming me.

There's one way out. Stabbing arms.

Oh, people leave houses too, they? hate nationalism source spreading emergency good rest world that's dire need low supply. eats inside, knowing elderly Canadians received doses instead dying European nationalism.

The doses charitably given away, they're graciously allowed safe passage companies export channels EU grants every single day. export channels unable used companies plants US, UK, India.

Had EU kept doses, it'd similar level doses used US, meaning slightly lower per capita still improvement. sufficiently shown able 80% vaccine usage rate, similar US, even impressive given multitude nations horrific unreliability AZ changes delivery amounts days delivery. leads higher stockpile account suddenly receiving millions fewer doses may already scheduled.

But no, keep calling blind nationalist, whilst almost certainly country currently benefiting vaccine nationalism EU's goodwill. high level vaccination 2% positive again. Testing levels dropping, hospitalizations rising 20-40 age range. Several buildings work closed positive covid cases today, coworkers symptomatic. Definitely feeling effects rise, work disrupted, seeing trend multiple coworkers testing negative several times symptomatic either family testing positive eventual positive test. That's getting bit disturbing, that's either change virus problem testing (possibility testing CVS common theme). missing point.  Protecting vaccinated yet. people going around masks lying vaccinated, poses risk general public. Hence best mask rule transition period. situation India good, probably agree export. asked two weeks ago, remember known back then. 20-year-old son risk-averse. He's extremely cautious pandemic done things experts advised. surprised day admitted may get shot ( he's still undecided ).

He's extremely concerned potential long-term repercussions getting vaccine versus danger age group. He's happy got shot he's still exploring feels getting his. horrid. That’s anti-vaccine stance. I’m saying people right decide themselves. pro vaccine also support people making medical decisions. Feel free browse post history, I’ve advocating vaccine past year, ever since started.

I reiterate, however, people choose accept risk unvaccinated free so. Trying impose social travel restrictions people choose get un-American. never treated medical issue way. AIDS epidemic isolate HIV positive, impose restrictions gay community (where spreading most) keep interacting other. Suggesting people chose vaccinate treated second class citizens shameful. Furthermore, group would also include people seem suggest would protected restrictions placed upon unvaccinated people. taking “data suggests, said CDC,” claiming “CDC said longer wear masks.”

That intentional misinformation.  somebody explain me, come Corona test positive next day another test one negative? result trust then? often happen? already 2 close friends happen them. Would appreciate could also link studies it. what's general accuracy test? Argumentum Ad Hominem. take sick time get 2nd shot. I’m taking days vacation days case get bad side effects. It’s messed wasn't. denialism - mid Feb made clear threat Covid imposed. countries acted others believe risks there. countries listened would acted earlier, simple. yes, literally said comment replying to.

u mad? job consider whether someone might tough time reality. We're living pandemic. They're they've trained do. Eh, Netherlands Leiden specifically. Janssen HQ Belgium. there's certainly correlation though literally school district penalize evaluation took jury duty. told SUPERINTENDENT, caught taking days child sick us, would seriously consequences. Luckily, teacher, aide. think teachers couple days taken passed tenure teachers district, living dream world. reality I'm at. Amazon. public school. 1,972,021 first doses nearly +100k versus last Thursday! carry virus I'm fully vaccinated, there's nothing protect anyone from. wear mask? what’s that? it? a) scope drastically expanded proposals. School/some travel visas nearly comprehensive list vaccine status tracked adding restaurants/stadiums/bars/etc. list massive massive scope increase. adding COVID additional requirement existing checks that's one thing adding many orders magnitude places checked huge change.

b) common ""vaccine passport"" setup talked showing vaccine history directly, showing QR code tied government database gives yes/no response. behavior infrastructure normalized trivial add things COVID vaccination status database return yes/no response. mean, main point go one 20+ states eligible, yes, think wait victory lap now. Odds vaccines protect longer 6 months without much waning efficacy, extent data tell us point. science medical communities always conservative messaging, opposite could lead unsafe behaviors relaxed restrictions. I’m fine without Donald Trump life. tone set nation . . . ideal.  also happy odds Covid-19 survival (~99% ages 1-70). Oh wait.. appointments Fridays. first shot laid two days. 4????

what

and happens get sick Week?

are paid  difference make? We’re talking 3rd shot. Booster shots would one. lab theory probably legit dont want know...

so lucky live US Considering 2 autoimmune disease hahahah you’re dumber fuckin cory trevor... **fucked** great least proof lasts least 6 months. hopefully get one year. happens exposed vaccine? Someone (masked) close contact literally way get (moderna) vaccine tested positive COVID. happens now? employers right decide don’t want disease vectors property

I agree don’t surprised get downvotes SPREADING SUPPORTING MISINFORMATION

Are mental breakdown something? typing caps like lol. find ironic you’re accusing spreading misinformation said right deny vaccine wants to. **Opinions don’t like misinformation**. woman article never said vaccine bad, said she’s personally skeptical doesn’t want moment. Again: **Opinions don’t like misinformation**. calling misinformation literally misinformation itself. NYTimes modeling expects us hit 50% May 10, 45% end April realistic deaths, pleasant. already exist variants evade immunity far better B.1.351. Luckily, immunity evasion stems glycan coatings turn make difficult virus actually bind ACE2 receptor. Yeah, US paying shots administration (like actual act putting arm) insurance. programs reimburse providers uninsured. Absolutely ridiculous. described unnamed person unnamed location you’re concerned what? rude him? Who? Tell exactly rude to. Completely absurd. pull 65% butts. labatory test conducted earlier year: variants. get new flu shot theres there's new flu strain almost every year. evolves suuuuuper fast. viruses do. That's like, thing. Lol reality Americans. penalized take side effects. say that, they'll find another reason punish it. one done unless side effects lessen. got engaged August (2020) course haven’t started planning anything even picked date. want big wedding (we’ve together 6 yrs &amp; lived together 4) even wedding general (family does) definitely want party! point is, I’m literally surprised many people questioned logic holding planning anything middle pandemic. Like I’m crazy one don’t want put others risk party. general response usually includes “You letting life controlled” “You can’t live fear.” aside fact we’re looking forward actually paying it. reality could kill elderly family members selfishly impatient I’m interested starting married life way. ‘then’ I’m perfectly happy waiting plan actual blowout without COVID concerns. Better take 2 weeks covid exposure actual illness. mean don’t get wrong general need shift work culture sick time given alternative needing use even sick time potentially serious illness think pick lesser 2 evils. sorry, don’t agree. you’re nurse, least, care saving lives. guess aren’t MRNA vaccines? Someone educated topic speak this. Generally mutations. know tetanus need every 10 years step nail something, don’t know even it’s 10 years. became much happier person stopped watching television. Inn going go back get ""second"" shot every three months. Yeah, fucking horrible. haven’t COVID thank god. act like pest, get treated like pest. painful watch. Yesterday ""Millions doses ruined J&amp;J plant"" headlines today we're seeing comments like ""I scheduled get J&amp;J I'm worried getting 'bad batch'. cancel?"" 90% number reported recent CDC means getting COVID infection all. participants study sent weekly nasal swabs PCR testing. 10% get COVID mild cases. try get appt Friday work hours? would give weekend get side effects. ☹️ far 31 cases **CVT** alone Germany. Again, blood clots. much, much higher number would expected without vaccine, CVT usually rare.

The rate death Covid-19 **healthy** 40-year-olds certainly 0.1% (1,000/1,000,000). I’m sure “only prevents severe illness” came from. lot people misunderstanding different efficacy numbers different trials. mRNA vaccines shown 90% efficacy preventing infection. That’s asymptomatic symptomatic infection. came several real world studies U.K. US. studied healthcare workers vaccinated tested weekly infection. 

There change discussions lower efficacy vaccines like J&amp;J Oxford. cases people wanted tout reduction severe illness hospitalization apposed lower symptomatic infection efficacy. around 70% J&amp;J US trial. 

Then people Reddit began repeating false statement vaccines designed prevent severe illness death ridiculous statement. Vaccines aren’t designed manner. vaccines created intent stopping infection. succeeded amazingly well that. kind efficacy, mRNA vaccines, among best vaccines ever created. Considering scientists initially hoping vaccines 50% effective, 90% stellar. need new job, real. point, biggest limiting vaccine Black population south hesitancy, access. Kemp Georgia stupidly sent tons vaccines white rural areas weeks, leaving little mass vaccination sites Atlanta big cities. finally course corrected last week.

I drive 30 minutes north white anti-vax county Georgia, city enough appointments vaccines everyone qualified. Surprised Brazil made appearance, reddit hard-on Bolsonaro so... Venn diagram one circle (mostly)? kinda sucks wrongly caught net that.

I post conspiracy subs because, tbh, like debunking arguing dumb shit. ends getting banned subs ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ said vaccine proved 95% effective preventing severe COVID-19, 100% effective preventing cases among 800 volunteers South Africa, B.1.351 coronavirus variant prevalent. I’m Pfizer trial went couple weeks ago 6-month post vaccine blood draw could analyze results. It’s 2-year study. sound inhumane. 🤣 I'm pregnant, even ovaries! LOL oh. Ok. I’ll quit job generous sick pay benefits I’ve ever adult life for....? aware job market like right now? 

This America. paid sick leave like. live surely you’re aware. don’t, someone tell health insurance. That’ll blow mind sure.  Vaccine hesitant come around friends vaccinated fine. Vaccine resistant... well... you’re probably going change stupid Laughs European. lack information? would actively blocking information see concern communicating reasonable skepticism become overblown attract anti-vax mentalities?

That assumes ""reasonable skepticism"" actually reasonable. apply J&amp;J single dose vaccine less effective double dose Moderna? 35 years need receive 6 doses vaccines per month.

There also gulags non conformists. fuck disease... want smell come back normal, lot things dont smell like old garbage, maybe abilikty breathe freely... even care every joint hurting more. Correct. J&amp;J, ultimately people remember contractors fuck up. \-- 91% effective 6-months, based 927 cases. case count high, seems pretty reliable actually good news. protection dropping couple percent 6 months, likely remain protective much longer time. going drop 0% sudden 1 year.

\-- take booster, sometime next year, necessary.

\-- remaining 9% still going benefit vaccine, one case severe disease vaccinated group. vaccine going protect almost everybody.

\-- Seems protect South African B.1.351. 800 people enrolled, 9 cases vs. 0. Sample size low, however still good sign. Need wait bit actual efficacy duration protection.

&amp;#x200B;

So far pretty amazing news me. It’s insane right? get pretty intense “sickness” flu shot. far covid shot whole level. 

I’m lucky office isn’t open right don’t worry temp checks. shot Friday STILL fever. there’s third shot, we’ll likely person time. can’t take 1+ week shot. literally don’t much PTO. cannot life see somehow personal moral failure. Would nice vaccine doses…

Why many people think problem lies administration process? simply don’t enough doses. hope don’t become commonplace. couldn’t see shopping store demands see medical information I’m vaccinated. working boosters. enrolled booster trial tests, data helpful OG trials more. Someone pay vaccine. free *consumers*, vaccine free. health insurance company, billed. it’s worth, should. pay premium cost vaccine less premium people. responsible healthcare costs and, according ACA, already supposed cover 100% several different kinds preventative care. cost far less money pay vaccine pay stint emergency room. 

If *don’t* insurance, case many Americans, *then* government pay vaccine. Either way, there’s *zero* cost you. anyone tries charge you, walk find another vaccine cause one might legit. 

Tl;dr- Vaccines cost money someone pay them. probably people pay pay healthcare. Seriously though, demand starts falling off, I’d like see companies really step offer free things getting vaccinated. Thanks correction. aware that. Personally, skeptical lack information regarding vaccination. really get vaccinated area that's different story. really irrational wait 4 month study got released? concern communicating reasonable skepticism become overblown attract anti-vax mentalities? like Phone. Phone X percent battery.

once lasts 1 hour confidently say lasts 1 hour. u Dont % much left cannot say lasting 1 hour. 2 hours Pass say lasts 2 hours.

basically dont know long lasts yet. know atleast 6 months What’s outrageous states, nothing prevent employer granting sick time also punishing using sick time. This, drove 2.5 hours way suburban Philly Poconos (mountains/rural). So... need boosters vaccines? vaccines early testing immunologists/virologists predicting effectiveness 6mos 2 years. It’ll interesting see close was. boosters needed they’ll likely include variety spike proteins cover problematic variants. thought second shot booster first one. remember figures. based rough estimates 1% infected would die, herd immunity would eventually kick 60-75% would get infected.  wasn’t time frame, “the course epidemic”.

Suppression tactics (masks social distancing stopping short full elimination) didn’t exactly reduce potential death toll .... they’ve delayed infection vaccines arrived herd immunity reached hard way.

Without vaccines you’d still track eventually reach couple million deaths (maybe 1.5 million since treatment better early days).  would’ve taken years. They'll start getting places start requiring proof vaccination enter travel.

Corporate America started offering carrots (got free donut last week Krispy Kreme! yum!) also may start threatening sticks. Due scarcity vaccines right carrots enough, reason people can't get vaccinated stubbornness, time break sticks. date, 10% region's total population received one vaccine dose, 4% completed full vaccine series, organisation said.

CV2 mutating like flu might necessary yearly shot going forward. See, issue UK variant huge concern unvaccinated. Pfizer vaccine crushes it. Therefore, vaccinated, UK variant changes nothing. either use sick time shots, sick time Covid itself...pick battles.

Companies/Corporations required provide time something voluntary. Regardless great reason is. Last 6 months 1st vaccines given mid December today’s date April 1st? think phase 1 trials moderna started march last year. sure pfizer. phase 1 trials much smaller phase 2/3 trials though, may enough data. Here’s press release cdc days ago made buzz overlooked media. One study’s strengths design: participants self-collected nasal swabs week RT-PCR laboratory testing, regardless whether developed symptoms illness. Researchers able look evidence SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective symptoms. small number (10.7 percent) infections study asymptomatic (i.e., result symptoms). However, majority infections (58 percent) occurred among people whose infections identified testing developed symptoms knew infected. study demonstrates two mRNA vaccines reduce risk SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic important preventing asymptomatic pre-symptomatic infections among health care workers essential workers vaccination help prevent spread SARS-CoV-2 care serve**.Findings study complement earlier reports two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reduce asymptomatic symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. good point! weekends wherever live? Woah settle there. World Health Organisation, that's who. mixed dosing study expected conclude Autumn. actually really important dealing current wave(s) shaping booster programmes next year potentially world wide regulators accept findings. 

If mixed dosing gives acceptable efficacy healthcare providers would constrained procuring boosters matched original course.

This would good healthcare providers (and state funders) less good pharma giants. Moderna $30 dose vs Pfizer $15 becomes interesting justification even AZ maybe $8 $10. anyone news vaccines used protecting P1 variant? oh no, oh no, oh nononononooo don’t worry, CDC isn’t gonna come say will. Cell mediated immunity lasts forever memory cells don’t forget make antibodies. If/when need get booster, it’ll variants. live UK get 4 paid sick days year. old job ""unlimited"" though. feel mad. Same, second shot uncomfortable. woke second day entire body pain Quit job get opportunity work elsewhere. know opportunities don’t grow trees, nuts. don’t deserve employees. Plus, worst would happen even lasted 6 months would would need booster shot. ""2 shots every 6 months'. I'm hopeful effectiveness lasts longer 6 months though think highly likely will. love said something jest, clearly referencing getting sick shot bunch ""Reddit-types"" jumped injustice employer broader political context.

I totally get saying feel way. employer would totally fine took sick day, want *this*. they’re available everyone- they’re available everyone age 16. Children get sick. Usually “severe” need hospitalization, lots kids suffering lingering complications mild cases. It’s destroying sports careers lot adolescents.  measuring risk death covid young people? Exactly, kind thrombosis showing exceptionally rare (in press conference said **one** single case expected time period) EMA published report even recent data (which said themselves). Thus, kind thrombosis showing lot often ""should"" what's alarming showing young healthy people, exactly people showing all. still claim increased rate incidents?

I'm talking thrombosis general, I'm talking specific thrombosis showed mostly young females getting AZ vaccine.

And couple days later scientists Greifswald hospital Germany said found trigger symptoms. scolding parent techniques.

I guess question whether legitimate concerns (fortunately few) healthcare workers real reasons impeding getting vaccine, factor risk represent patients getting vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  100%. absolutely love fact haven’t sick anything since like January 2020. issue lack data, lack protection. Participants vaccinated 6 months ago. still working. 6 months now, say vaccine lasts 12 months. 300lbs smoking next grandbabies, might well one foot grave banana peel start. cases I’m vaccinated people still getting even want produce may.  would say lot factors involved besides rules/mandates place, location state, population density, etc. 

Rules/mandates one (very important) piece puzzle. Many vaccines require boosters... anything new. Glad thankfull country blocks exports moves disrupt supply chains outside I'm merely talking timeline, COVID like flu Hospitalizations really lagging indicator? doses never made bottles. ingredient contaminated Emergent Maryland, caught.

Currently J&amp;J doses factory Netherlands. MMR kill anyone? looks like no. Cause AZ vaccine killing people, that's newsworthy. would much different flu shot point, right? will. soon we've meeting it. Followed briefing. Followed workflow analysis. Followed debrief.

It's kind comforting we've finally found something Germans awful at. Comedy vaccines. internal monologue mine identical. least even 10% end getting it, we’ve pretty much ruled serious COVID, hospitalization, death vaccinated. work “bad cold / flu”. 

That said, first meal restaurant year another fully vaxxed person last weekend. *was* really nice get little slice normal back... everyone listened WHO, world would better place now. advice ignored constantly Somebody inform Dr. Fauci CDC director positive news. still seem pessimistic public statements. NJ.com article: “Persichilli said state also expecting deaths increase warned state could “a long difficult summer” numbers materialize. added hospitalizations likely won’t reach levels first wave last spring state adequate supplies battle pandemic.”

Scare tactics. state definitely right lmao. one really paid attention quarantine anyway. keep population rejecting vaccine

Every time organization tries bend truth head public panic, backfires.

There real, deeply concerning side effects vaccine absolutely newsworthy.

Attempting control message causes skepticism. So, professional sports games music concerts open allow everyone attend. I've hardly ever washed hands eating unless visibly dirty sick years, issue me, makes difference.

I reason care bacteria hands can't see, taste, smell feel effects from. Also, mental gymnastics justify US exporting biontech vaccine? Let’s hope friend. everyone saying, ""the pandemic get vaccine,"" not. longer worldwide threat.

There still concerns vaccinated people still spread virus, even lesser chance. vaccinated, possibly kill you.

The light end tunnel finally visible, still ways away. So, sure, party people vaccinated, continue responsible spread public people vaccinated. FUCKYOU poor summary somatic hyper mutation. 

You’re immune system isn’t trying make B cell variants respond future virus variants. It’s refining library B cells better job recognizing *original variant* infected with. Somatic hyper mutation improve response variants many regions virus different variants. threw variant different enough original would luck.  think rollout Europe acceptable?  dipshits get vaccinated, variants big deal. variants likely explain spike cases U.S despite 130 million doses administered.

They ripping dipshit population. ""No, think won't."" - CNN Also, mental gymnastics justify US exporting biontech vaccine? I'm sorry loss. Also, I'm sorry people monsters.  agree you, I’m mildly interested counterpoint this. Like, could less effective? so, how/why?  hypothetical ""immunity evading"" variant may cause hospitalization vaccinated populations. Also tweak vaccine booster shots nearly tall order initial vaccination. though people difficulty accepting COVID 19 humanity's rearview mirror. 

\*NOTE: Opening prior widespread vaccination still idiotic; we're home stretch people want risk much close end maddening. guy suggesting vaccinations holy water thoughts prayers, could speed increased mostly stalled supply. Demand massive. Ok. That’s good. mean, part, many city aren’t wearing masks many 95%+ time home. isn’t comfortable (especially approach summer) breathing humid breathe mask. 6 months? hope that's lowballing number. I've gotten two shots, 6 months, might feeling like ""what vaccine for"" get 2 shots every 6 months indefinitely. many people? many etsts compared last year? asshole source AstraZeneca isn’t safe ... that’s happens rushing vaccine development Sort of. It’s much harder you’ve figured there’s lot less “magic” troubleshooting/tweaking biological products like ad vectored vaccines. time stores opening Monday call worst case right? think likely either theoretically possible. next 8 weeks really show coming true not. like think cases start declining rapidly again. got information from? poor testing back then, beginning Wuhan tests use CT diagnose patients, (and tests less sensitive tests today, Dr Li Wenliang swabbed 8 times confirmed positive. ) released updated death count 50% higher, adding bunch deaths believe probably Covid never confirmed swab, Forgot tap head know want believe ""this end COVID"", scenario describe occur vaccinated individuals neither carry virus get sick enough individuals get immunity confers lasts long enough. either conditions fails, COVID end yet, likely never completely eradicated, way smallpox is. create super virus thrives masks! :-o got 2nd Moderna shot 11:50am got sore arm within hour. got symptoms 12 hours after. Fever, chills add slamming headache woke next day. Lasted whole next day normal time went bed. make sure trip couple meters finish line. keep good work well truly over. Maybe vaccine rollout wasn’t total shit. imagine brainwashed believe flu magically disappearing deadlier virus exists conspiracy theory Germany put money later on. actual *development * vaccine funded 100% Pfizer. Europe,huh? link confirm that? think long viewed personal choice ""We need mandate yearly"" get reasonable response. Post COVID, I'm bus flu season future, masking makes sense. pop store grab couple things I'm beach? Nah. basically right. vary state, demand saturation increasingly met many states. People see shortage today assume persist long time, happens rather suddenly supply demand works. goes impossible find appointment, week two ""oh wow getting easier book appointment"" ""wow, every place vaccines."" 

While binary (like vaccinations stop right away), many states leveled declining vaccination rates despite continuously increasing supply. 

Mississippi gone nowhere early March (in fact gone down) despite open all. 20K/day rate administration, presently delivered vaccine supply lasts 28 days - far justifiable two week administration lag. days supply growing daily. Alabama even worse (although ""technically"" general availability yet, based definitions 90%+ population covered). 39 days supply. Compare California okay amazing - 14 days supply. Massachusetts? 8 days. 

Very roughly, categorize states following buckets: 
&lt;14 days supply: Supply constrained - 25 states 
15-21 days supply: Either demand constrained within specific regions states incompetent logistics - 15 states day supply: Demand constrained - 10 states 

More falling days supply. Aaprovla slow Pfizer Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca waited New Year file Conditional Marketing Authorization, elsewise vaccine would available earlier January. Johnson Johnson vaccine approved month ahead arrival first doses. agreement

I need start using phrase often. least they've got priorities straight! vacinne developed Janssen belgian part j&amp;j?

Also US fund dutch plant? really doubt hoping expecting point time we’d options home kit. Something could buy Walgreens something test home. problem kind absolutely good news amount people anti-maskers anti-vaxxers use information either lie saying already vaccinated need wear mask believe since people getting vaccinated, need to. One best friends deep territory now. thinks entire thing completely inflated doctors make money labeling deaths covid. asked many people thinks would need involved global conspiracy scale think signed Discord point. going chemo

She pfizer vaccine went fine Again, case Europe easy target. going criticise US US take shit. They'll pull funding moves. Criticising EU way make look good without risk Pretty positive it’s vaccine thanks concern. don’t really option staying home work regardless. It’s really routes needed kind situation don’t doses satisfy needs simultaneously. UK Israel prioritizing strictly age healthcare workers first, much better US. UK impressively so, especially since given doses roughly rate US Israel given ton more. want prevent deaths one dose hand, give oldest person know. It’s simple that. don’t see patients, you’re sort irrelevant whole equation, delicate balance maintain regardless convince perceived importance. pocket cost vaccines, require health insurance information sign up, anyways? Presumably 1/50 dead 98% survival rate, comment he's replying oral sex atmosphere definitely number 1 to-do list. plan A?  many headlines “Pfizer vaccine works 6 months” leading many people saying “it works 6 months?!?!?! What’s point?!”


Wish they’d learn word things better. Whoosh love new dichotomy ol' Donny deserves credit developing vaccines, one take safe. wonder many studies articles needed finally put Fear Variants bed. New Jersey reportedly planning vaccines 65% effective variants. real. get another shot 6 months cry. can’t keep taking time work! surprise slightest.

Even people Montgomery pretty compliant gotten lax last couple weeks governor decided lengthen mandate numbers still dropping.

These morons understand keep works problem gone. immediately stop taking medicine start feel better. want cough go away.

I get annoyed AL go place shit even worst behaved state South. girlfriend nurse told every single one nurses works anti vaxxer. It’s depressing. know what? I'm down. Fuck anti vaxxers. plastered headlines/news?  made laugh , great comment ! Get ready downvoted. Oh man, I’m sorry. get dizzy seeing blood occasionally white coat syndrome. point. Get enough people vaccinated we’ll fine. fact poster knows someone got really means nothing vaccine didn’t already know. significantly slow transmission. lead eradication, enough people vaccinated. get moved FDA approval emergency approval will. day coming quick. Nope, let’s stay shut another year....just case, know? Lol, no, real Americans support nonsense. I'll go wherever fuck please Interesting

My state prioritization smokers general pop vaccine Water wet get rid viruses immune systems tank next virus manages sneak 40% death rate people don’t seem understand: medical degree understand science behind vaccines, viral transmissions, etc... doesn’t mean best person make value judgements trade-offs COVID restrictions costs society restrictions impose.

Someone knows treat cancer necessarily one knows many resources society invest cancer research. goes COVID fully vaccinated. people got first shot yet receive second shot, extended beyond manufacturers recommended time period shots. high rates vaccine hesitancy amongst poor black people US result history racist treatment

They need move on. muh freedom lol No, hospitalisations first noticed. link established now, link still looked at. probably keeping press (and EU commission) reminded supply issue Pfizer/BioNtech met contractual agreements. Politicians often clumsy things whatever outcome EU commission AZ, Pfizer/BioNtech want get caught it.

Good PR strategy IMO. shot 95% effective severe covid.  longest I’ve got without catching cold. I’m gonna keep wearing masks long people vaccinated 30 mil 120 mil contracted... bit short... stupid news shit, long astra zenecea prevents severe lethal cases 100% effective worth it. keep bashing instanly bad news it.

In germany could get shot jump 100 floor would title : man dies astra zeneca shot..... nothing EU whatever want regards assets, factories etc... owned US companies EU get Either way going get doses sooner. Interfering process exactly that, interfering. Thankfully actually reducing production all. 

The EU rights, would vaccine, instead vaccines going UK USA. talking nonsense disseminate fact EU leadership UTTERLY failed populace trying dissuade populace voting throwing blame. 

The EU minimal vaccines two reasons:  
1-Misinformation Astra-Zeneca (which proven risk, almost EU countries stockpile of)  
2- Inept EU leadership early now. would Italy Germany negotiating Russians Sputnik Vaccine? self-loathing smugness thread. Turns every region world terrible controlling spread. Europe still far ahead vaccination compared rest world. thenrest world thank China, Russia eu even vaccinate little can. Ripped right body aches day loss taste. downright brutal Nothing 100% certain fool proof, like first thing anyone actual science background know.  There’s evidence support Vaccinated people aren’t spreading virus. Scroll subreddit &amp; you’ll see there’s post linking proper scientific study heavily advertised state ended restrictions, Texas, cases still going state still restrictions, Michigan, cases going up.

Michigan actually relaxed bunch restrictions several weeks ago - schools, bars, sports, etc. ""Everything open"" free Texas is, Michigan stepped back bunch restrictions B.117 taking southeast Michigan we're paying price. surprised. monster guys reared. going keep moving goal posts masks social distancing completely normal. don’t know longer six months essentially one vaccinated longer that.

What people first trial? line basically every vaccine humanity ever developed entire history vaccination. Polio one vaccines break 95% threshold that’s still ~3 shots. 

“It’s 100%!” Isn’t rhetorical hill people die convince vaccinated people still mask majority people position they’re at. Wait ... vaccine going annual? WTF?!? fucked!!!! No, y'all downvoted people sick tired misinformation vaccine skepticism peddled around BS gonna make last LONGER. stop it. dying Covid/losing months recovering seems like good answer I've met alarming amount people getting vaccine, hopefully make 70-80% vaccinated. TIL vaccines exactly they’re engineered do.

Who knew? report indicates 95% effective severe covid. Well, that's nice then.

As long Special Olympics music industry carry normal... Sure, I'll go pick another vaccine vaccine tree. got mine 5g fucking legit. literally play rocket league thoughts wonder there's correlation educational attainment 🤔 Yeah, surprised make sound like memory B cells brand new discovery, think misleading: “The emerging idea body maintains reserve armies antibody-producing cells addition original cells responded initial invasion SARS-CoV-2.” That’s like saying “the emerging idea skin cut [a new kind knife] blood form clot stop bleeding.” Absolutely, get choice, possibly go Pfizer conservatives already shitting over, ""vaccine passports""?

As general rule thumb, conservatives invent things get upset absence policy actually like. upset whole thing.

So, make good policy worry conservatives think. They're going upset either way. Well least count uk since germany doesnt even manage safe vacc developed country It’s don’t data six months yet, trial participants haven’t vaccinated long. likely longer, careful phrasing results. US good job EU poor job regards vacciNtion. It’s really simple bud Yay. I’m scheduled get Pfizer one April. figure make dicks stay hard longer they’ll probably good vaccine. Lol Yeah matter. region herd immunity, additional outbreaks unless massive influx unvaccinated visitors occurs. article claims vaccine makes high percentage people ""immune"" virus. 95% vaccines. mask required.

I also read many times vaccine prevents severe sickness, someone still get carrier virus. Therefore, masks still necessary.

So correct??? Someone set straight please. really reals? It’s published Mayor Bowser’s situational reports. find city’s covid website Twitter. number 177,000 March 25. Yeah second someone says “this coming someone who’s vaxxed” know they’re full shit. They’re kind people conservative white pretend black liberal, say heinous shit, conservatives piggyback it. It’s one stupidest parts Internet 2021. Thank you! Appreciate link 95% time, variants virus wasn’t prevalent today Yeah Bloomberg really weird. heavily pushing anti-AZ stuff media. Remember ran story 29m doses discovered Italy 'definitely' going UK really EU vaccine doses haha Typically turns vaccines last longer, six months they're sure since people got six months ago longest innoculated test guess recurring subscription model might pipe. feel full patent reprieve encourage bunch inferior less effective knockoffs. Perhaps manufacturers quality vaccines encouraged temporarily license product capable manufacturers (think Merck, Sanofi, Serum Institute, etc) $1 something, sort profit sharing scheme, would great! yet keep increasing capacities everything. concerned increasing indoor dining capacities! large part they’ve completely ignored that’s really point. That's exactly got mine. town fairly blue, vaccines. Drove 15 min road small clinic town still flying trump flags, walked 30min later vaccinated. hasn’t even opened vaccines adults yet. 

Yet another reason end restrictions. we’re talking kids too?

WSJ point end.

When deaths/hospitalizations low levels vaccinations high enough cannot bounce back. close yet. find dizzying observation gets downvoted. Darn, that's awful... data yet aware of? mean: life span, maybe info general condition someone recovered virus? Kind hard politician worshiped spent entire year downplaying entire pandemic conservative news outlets joined in. Agreed. anecdotal evidence number young people strong reactions early first dose dual dose vaccines. 

You can’t reaction without antibodies can’t antibodies early without virus inside system. Ergo... Alright, hope you’re right. concerns given rhetoric continued see CDC (“impending doom”) Fauci (live arts happen “sometime fall”) late. states seem fully willing follow whatever say, don’t see would suddenly stop happening summer, regardless case/hospitalization/death data point worst case scenarios always really awful. ended beating moderate case winter scenario pretty well, restrictions they’re like “restrictions.”

It’s basically Florida except wear mask going Walmart. know release trials, omit participant factor. little damning say good six months wildfire see social media morning worth getting six month deal. Whoa. Raw dogging completely different meaning here! Lmao.

Don't Google it, Bing it.  saying reason rapidly found false assume proper herd immunity reached better drug available ala polio measels smallpox vaccines bright side getting delayed indication uptake high area.

A vaccinated person unvaccinated population likely get measles unvaccinated person heavily vaccinated population. 

Your protection partially vaccine, especially now, longterm mostly community. say it’s business related lol... even child tax credit peanuts compared kids cost. sub immediately downvotes anyone doesn’t bend one knee worship vaccine daily basis, name “science” despite caring science benefits them. Notice sub full people loved Fauci saw second coming Christ virus broke out, believing could wrong. vaccines rolling good chunk sub dislike says still careful limit activities even vaccine. said, care science benefits them.  high rates vaccine hesitancy amongst poor black people US result history racist treatment medical community? read commenting easy? Yeah except younger people like 40 way likely get plus side, gonna charismatic. past year made realize many people's smiles fake shit. smile eyes people! think found smokers get Covid less general population, ones get outcomes worse. weirdly makes want watch novelty seeing crowd people. Yeah, news and, well, everyone, dropping ball since beginning. Saying they're sure vaccine last something like saying sure apple fall back throw air. Yeah, possible strong gust wind blow away passing bird catch it, generally take things like serious consideration. Oh baby get another shot like getting flu 🤧 amazing news, I’m reading article literally coming across possibly worrying article “breakthrough” covid cases people fully vaccinated still getting covid, course happening city, 50% also FDA’s magic efficacy number vaccine candidate. bright you? Biontech 100% German company, Bruh... might stupid suggestion maybe could ask doctor prescribe zofran/anti nausea med (not lot, like 2-3 pills something) could take prevent vomiting case get nauseous vaccine. APRIL FOOLS! People received vaccine trials prior December. people volunteered study also followed receiving vaccine monitor response. willing take Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine? so, get available. not, know he's making excuses.  Washington state announced yesterday everyone 16+ eligible vaccine starting April 15th. pretty high demand relative states already opened eligibility, really shows supply longer concern. concern convincing people get it. I’ve never seen anybody serious make claim. instead making fun people try understand discussion it. worth mentioning Tetanus shot virus. Clostridium tetani bacteria causes tetanus. Excuse me, hard lockdown since fucking November?!? reason get yearly flu vaccine variants long lasting immunity isn’t there. One human viral disease ever eradicated human history small pox. virus us forever. Unfortunately. sell short! job market going look good year IMO. lean, competitive, WFH transition able start finding jobs available living high COL areas. partial full. Still? tried taking fever-reducer it? would smart thing do. Unfortunately around live, lucky find vaccine luckier able schedule appointment get it.

That needs fixed else. drive hour find appointment first shot. boss sounds like real jerk. You’re crazy one. They’re crazy fuck. greatest emergency us ever see large gatherings exactly don’t want happen. 

Are “living fear” every time put seatbelt? decide smoke cigarettes? sort vague generalizations like “living fear” “letting control you” ways control you. cost benefit analysis right. Don’t give small-minded folk. 

Besides doubt want atmosphere pandemic hanging special event.  Yes, this! never got sick pandemic, I've always really fastidious washing hands. Even toddler daycare, avoid lot illness way. Whenever read ""I sick since started usually get 3-5 bad colds year!!"" wonder lot people practicing basic hygiene this. think keep wearing mask flu season anyway. ice broken America. Wearing mask common sight like already asian countries. miss getting flu lol. They'll update us data. Bruh, 90% vaccine invented America. people work Biontech invented mRNA stuff? Americans. people invented stabilized spike protein? Americans. Pfizer literally copied spike protein Moderna, got US NIH. think that's always true. Tetanus boosters, example, every 10 years due new variants bacteria. second shot kicked ass good 36 hours I'm sorry hear bad reaction shot.. fortunately mean next one get bad. body may gotten used would consider ""same ol', ol'"" feel nothing different.

Hopefully follow shots 6 months year intense you. Yes, add time compile review data publishing. confidently say 6 months reviewing data 6 weeks. 

I suspect we'll know effectiveness wears due news stories, data proving months FT much better Covid articles 50% fully vaccinated? That's amazing. That's level Israel started massive drop off. second jab 10 minutes ago, sooner world vaccinated better. Black American vaccine hesitancy rates higher average. Math hard, huh? Especially large percentage leans way. Dude, one (offered) $15k deductible, $800/mo SINGLE COVERAGE. So, would cover (really anything) would pay $25k pocket. 

Great have... terminal cancer? guess? lol won’t reflecting anything thanks fella. 

Maybe pay attention people say, maybe also consider concept irony

But we’re splitting hairs, didn’t point say Canada “basically France”. said “pretty french”. alluding fact, also kindly pointed out, 22% population french. Perhaps should’ve said “almost quarter french”? Noted

And also, greatest respect, I’m pretty sure vast majority French Canadians aren’t generally consulted decisions matters like vaccine approval, need able pick macron line really isn’t requirement. politicians.. that’s different story, macrons number saved phones wife finally gets 3 paid weeks, worked place 7 years finally get That's say brand new vaccine. keep following initial recipients update us along way. could much longer way knowing exact, NY Times tracker expects us hit 50% *total population* May 10, current rate. 50% *adults* (age 18+) would equal 39% total population. Yes. I’m treatment Multiple Sclerosis targets B cells help stop immune system attacking spinal cord brain. Since started treatment, haven’t symptom relapse 4 bleeping years. fact, overall functionality, balance, etc improved. 

I’ve curious B cells covid-19 since pandemic started. lot folks don’t seem know B cells exist, let alone do. know politicians/bureaucrats completely risk averse. data strongly suggests messaging cdc “if get vaccine, live normally” instead “impending doom” need give people incentive get vaccinated. cdc director crying “impending doom” certainly isn’t that. problem thinking doesn’t stand reason. vaccinated person doesn’t need quarantine exposed? directly CDC guidelines. It’s can’t spread disease. 2 weeks post vax tomorrow plan kissing hugging every single one friends needed away past year. part Sucks employer like that. Employers general US abusive. all. companies raking billion-dollar PROFITS year? Yeah, I've worked least one - raises rare minimal, compensation plans cut lied (screwed $2500 - what? quit, filed unemployment, won. Never got $2500 back, moved state bothered travel back forth $$ civil court). 

WHY? companies greedy allotted 10 minutes time bathroom, used throughout day, along 10-15 mins MAX 2x/day breaks. lot jobs get tbh! 5 minutes late? 3 strikes? bud. 

Insane, clock anymore, stay accountable team, that's worked much better me, family, even employer. Fuck corporate wage slave. work small business now, still somewhat wage slaving, huge step previous shit shows I've displeasure exploited by. Nah, opinions ""I like,"" ""opinions based false misleading information."" ""Just opinion"" mean actually worth listening to.

Bye, troll! got pfizer weeks ago get warning ibuprofen, worth. Oh I'm questioning figures current strains, wondering future single jab year long term efficacy it'll seasonal thing like flu, formulations need rejig regularly response dominant strains emerge! someone still get carrier virus.
 
In theory vaccinated person generate significant viral load drastically decrease chance spread. Public health experts know this, statements take time back data, meantime masks recommendations continued pandemic default abundance caution. Additionally, announce masks optional people get anti-maskers refuse wear one even vaccinated. funny though, know couple people providing conspiracy theory level reasons wouldnt get months back. “I don’t need it.” Progress? definitely. someone used take public transportation pre-Covid, I'll probably start wearing mask flu season I'm taking bus train post-covid Please stop shitting America. companies way.

I live America work company unlimited sick days full pay. sick week, go short term disability reduced pay... occasional sick day problem. 

It definitely norm country, also company treats employees well America. I'm fortunate employer gives ""unlimited"" sick days family care. due nature work would get behind much took day mid-week this. 

I took Pfizer doses work hours able take advantage weekend side-effects. Luckily really (other sore arm) speak of. bro u even lmao  Maybe turn asset.

The vaccine hesitant group US republican men. Maybe rename one variants ""I hate America"" variant, ""I love (something left wing)"" variant.

""Dude, hear? Jimmy got hate America variant! Make sure stay hell away 10 days. Maybe get vaccinated?"" CDC trying defeat virus.

They trying open schools reopen economy.

I'm really interested state propaganda. Wow, finally concrete statement vaccines aren’t stumped variants. could almost cry That's option many people. Hell job gives us 5 days sick pay go basically anywhere else number 0. mention month paternity leave, excellent benefits everything else I'll lose top massive pay decrease. Welcome America, vast majority sick pay. Well, full lockdown since October November able go 8pm (until last month). sports closed, able swim ages. European countries, social life, restaurants, fitness studios swimming pools opened 75% time. 
And even much (or any) better supposed open stuff soon??? 
Well fuck supposed lose faith, really getting nerves start care less less restrictions rules (for example able see 1 person private). got shot mass vaccination site never asked insurance info, that's interesting. mean, despite blatantly wrong imply children human? don’t agree what? said nurses vaccine. I’m Mets fan living Tampa. moved 2017 haven’t seen live since. got first Pfizer shot Monday they’ll town mid-May I’m getting tickets soon they’re available! I’ll three weeks second shot excited. 🥰 kidding. I'm fortunate employer even asking apply sick time vaccine. 'Take much time need get vaccinated' policy. One employees got 'lottery' call vaccine fine leave spot scheduling get it. much time take off?  don’t wear masks everywhere anymore. even waste time typing out😂 6 months cuz really many months worth data. time goes number continue rise two also. It’s awful. Far I'm aware state, much problem. increased capacity bars restaurants 75%. scam continues we’re jab. Arguing vaccine nationalism idiotic. richest countries vaccinate poor countries first, entire world much worse way around simply due massive economic downturn.  mean, covid would covered FMLA and/or TDI I’d get paid.... post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccine go effect immediately, exposed quarantine get tested become symptomatic usual. Put money research?

Both Biontech AstraZeneca vaccines developed EU. Please point specific thing said wrong. can’t find anything, feel free continue browsing personal account find unrelated flaws find motto useful wide variety social situations, really. stopped time 91% effective virus 99% survival rate, sounds legit. Could eventually reach point there's oral nasal version booster could own? would complicate vaccination records? Totally aware look fools defending telling “get new job.” LOL can’t nice things. shut up. many Americans sadly is. They’ll following clinical trial participants several years expect reports every while. letter debunked? don’t like says? story mom unfounded fears mRNA vaccines. listening bunch stupid people saying take bunch preventative measures taking zinc hocus pocus type remedies. Well results lab study close vaccine efficacy. Seems like look actual studies that, like one others show fully effective least one known starting see slow 65+ slow now. think going slow rise 75%+ them. number still pretty ""good"" given responses polling gone.

I think we'll see increase demand drops/supply increases enough walk-ins possible. Telling older folks go sign bunch disparate websites setting failure. Right now, process heavily favors younger generations. 

Once technology requirement goes away, would expect us capture good chunk remaining older population. got even news today Pfizer vaccine completely crushes even big bad South African variant people fully vaccinated carry virus. information people need see go back normal living they're fully vaccinated?? whatever want point! Narrator:   Anyone know applies JnJ well, pfizer/moderna? point variant mean anything special. outcome whether cases UK variant original sequence. vaccine effectiveness literally exact same. 

Israel shown mRNA vaccine still well 90% effective UK variant. news anything talk about. 

Different story talking SA variant, lot test data, we're yet. know people going best misunderstand ENTIRE POINT VACCINES. innate distrust computer technology.

I understand that. understand power AI, deep fake, robotic emerging computer tech detrimental couple years fall wrong hand? depend application. 

It's similar scientist view nuclear bomb. Fucking thank you! fair, I'm surprised hiccups point. Humans make mistakes. setback, still making progress. confirmed covid, don’t see issue waiting month two get vaccinated looks like Pfizer seek full FDA approval since 6 months data. full FDA approval enough you? Oh no, anyway.

Maybe sub finally stop shilling sub-par vaccine. fair, put france graph way worse brazil... think brazil crap healthcare system addition caring virus I'll fully immune May 9. rate we're going, half country vaccinated anyone wants vaccine get one. willing make effort get one then, bad.  Exactly. can't believe people reacting genuine attempts discussion beyond lobby level. sources data back up? Good. Humans meant live old normal, none new normal BS. Honestly point Bolsashito 10X worse Trump, coming somebody vehemently disliked Trump day one. hit 400K January 500K February. eventually started getting passed recent graduates.

It's skill, $$$

Why pay someone twice much pay naive young college grad half. That's literally anywhere comment replied to. Interesting say edited either. that's case OP kind shit sipping fritata. Worst comes worst, likely selling covid19 vaccines local Walgreens, behind counter. Here’s effed thing. It’s toothless bumpkin.  It’s Tom accountant, it’s Mary fun mother you’ve always looked to, it’s kids teacher.  half say Covid family fine. It’s really bad. Check link doctor really make think aspects concerning new vaccines.

But forget freaking dead wrong pandemic beginning straight through.  It’s like listening Q adherent.  Everything shifts fit need keep go forward. already. Practice makes perfect. I'm arguing country superior one, Europeans better people. even say that, fuck would white supremacy target white men worked employer year entitled 84 days FMLA fired US. noticed Hungarian. Everyone I’ve met racist Roma, awful.

Nice things, often educated, mention you’re Romany spit you. unfortunately grandchildren tech savory figure them. helped elderly neighbors get felt nice help can’t freaking conversations anymore. It’s idiotic.

I agree sorry loss. LFG that’s complete bullshit data back up. Thanks got round 1 last weekend. Cant wait round 2 couple weeks. always plan, they're admitting it. Die almighty dollar, plebs Pfizer already injected tens millions people. caused issues, we'd know now. Get shot, pal. ridiculous amount people thread thinks people get paid week work tummy hurts. Happy both! private companies use publicly funded infrastructure? based Europe Bangladesh? get highly trained researches, studied free public school universities. Yes it’s private companies this, without government would able do. Yeah major blow sure. Hopefully turn around quick. None said translates ""this vaccine lasts long time.""

Why bother telling people lasts 6 months A: may last far longer, B: apparently know either way? release information 1-month mark? article would've titled ""Covid vaccine lasts least 1 month!""

See poorly worded, unnecessarily released, potential causing alarm? say sick leave that? I'm employer can't details. I'm sick. Convo over. approved vaccines far seem solid choices. yes mRNA ones far appear best. sterilised

Yes there’s drawback forcibly sterilising people, it’s don’t trust doctors anymore. Thanks edgy HS college kids Wise words. 6 months!!!! Really????? parents fully vaccinated moderna. 2nd shot, mom bed fever day half, dad said even tell arm got shot in.

My state opens 2 weeks. I'm kinda hoping got dad's genes comes covid vaccine reactions. people care able still get flu vaccine year, really true Never said afford it. get short long term disability coverage well, completely different. Millions Americans get disability pay. Honest question: someone clarify ""health system collapse"" means, practice? in, point look health system say fact collapsed. see tons tons posts **impending** collapse, really know means collapse actually happen. Man 100 kids Scheutbos Anderlecht Molenbeek area would blood running. bois de la cambre, 5000 people, refusing leave far 3 got arrested. love reporting well ""one lockdown much"", issue racaille bruxellois area guess. quote take couple days worst man get back it, pass. sounds like big baby honestly They’re destroy 15,000,000 doses someone fucked up. disagree. mRNA vaccines give us ability knock back severe symptoms viruses. 

The technology allows us train immune systems specific types N H antigens make cocktail administered yearly performance based interval. 

We opportunity limit severe disease outbreaks endemic viruses.

I think much optimistic future vaccine technology Yes. Please. article also stated 50% state residents 65 fully vaccinated.

To add: state opens everyone 16 April 5th. counties hit target goals early opened 16 last week. work large hospital confirm statement. nurses Dunning–Kruger effect combined vocal health professional, definitely let opinion known. 

There smart hard working nurses, usually reserved allow data come making conclusion like lot health care professionals. employer US imo value employees health, time life

Only special ones people exception end day profits. may jaded everywhere worked people care employees~ excluding 1 old boss company like found lovely ways fire guy~ nothing greed expense Intellectually true reality always thing. take work, mean without repercussion. Read thread examples people me. Moderna, Biontech, J&amp;J, NovaVax target prefusion spike. Oxford/AZ this. time probably continue see AZ struggle mutations candidates.

If AZ buys nations time get another candidate (one vaccines, second generation vaccine), done job. Right still capable reducing mortality making significant dent transmission. clear UK definitely still useful tool. course you’re Canadian 🤣 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt bunch countries lockdown social distancing. Brazil tracks deaths accurately others. Lmaooo six months. Wow still missing point. bad decisions wearing mask affect general populace fault own. Today first 7 day period we've reported 20M doses administered.

7-day moving average 2,903,730. week-over-week change daily reported administrations 526,670 doses. Given relatively strong uptick, may cross 3M moving average threshold weekend.

Side note, got 2nd dose morning, shift fully vaccinated column! Makes sense. know Illinois week adjusted added 100k administered doses pharmacies either behind reporting filling data forms. Whereas get shipment know everything make room sign ups. I’d like real-time data shots arms obviously it’s infinitely better people actually focusing getting Please let us know tomorrow. Moderna CEO indicated expectations vaccine two years. large difference? count flu shots too? know it’s apples apples, office flu shot event every year least last 8 years (before past fall). “unknowns” covid vaccines cause risk aversion? Think covid made lot people forget viruses  forget also quarantine India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt ton African countries lockdown social distancing. UK make anywhere near enough population agreed contracts companies based countries import extra knowing planned accordingly. would export tiny supply would mean we'd import even more? 

We've got small manufacturing capacity. countries needing import vilified exporting vaccines. can't suddenly become global supplier vaccines overnight. Okie doke. Enjoy living fear rest life. given human error. happen 15 million J&amp;J doses USA could happen plant.

Nothing guaranteed life. Could someone explain consequences ""health system collapse""? ""un-collapse"" wave COVID over? I've heard phrase many times past year always remained vague. J&amp;J received ""pre-buy"" handed money front vaccine later, though development paid for. However, handed $1 billion product exist yet pretty close. miserable antivaxxer somewhere else. hopefully go thru vax passports idiots like can't part civil responsible society. parents put college married home. grew whole self-righteous asshole phase got older. Put pipe smoke it.

Let also address defend folks may ask questions claim answers : listen assholes chastise challenging claims moral superiority. whatever order practice good sense making. Times especially difficult everyone, *especially* try understand things beyond superficial state, anyone condemns honestly self-deified internet warrior wishes actually good person. Go forth prosper. point shouldnt assume Modernas work mRNA without real world data. me, need following:

Neutralizing antibody

doesnt need high, some, enough meaningful. Tcells important people detectable antibody sarscov2 specific Tcells ends asymptomatic, avoided death hospitalization vice-versa, ppl Tcells HIGH antibody end well. confers Tcells alone protect resulting severe/death Hmm must've missed said that. must've somewhere else cause comment replied to. Thank you! Unfortunately hadn’t heard side effect kind caught us surprise, that’s fault looking side effects bit more. I’m glad people sharing stories went through, really help. No. evidence trial says vaccine high efficacy *at* 6 months, evidence high efficacy SA variant. means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future. know long amount time passed. could year, could also 5 years, 10 years, indefinitely. Everything ""proper location arm"" much likely everything it. Yeah pointless, especially many restrictions roadblocks continually throw front AZ vaccine. Although 10 million exact amount UK requested India, maybe symbolic dig got first Pfizer shot yesterday. Literally everyone else talked said basically ZERO side effects besides sore arm.

Looks like drew short straw wwwoooo feel like absolute ASS today. However... care. Still worth it. even bit hesitant going back round 2. wanna able take kids places let fun. poor 3 year old idea life lived almost entirely house. billion people could agree, it'd still factually incorrect.  entire country legalized ;) No. evidence trial says vaccine high efficacy *at* 6 months, evidence high efficacy SA variant. means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future. know long amount time passed. could year, could also 5 years, 10 years, indefinitely. Great, get get poked feel like shit every 6 months rest life. Hmm. possible translate mRNA used today's COVID vaccines saRNA? know much looks like vectors similar, addition non-structural proteins subgenomic promoter saRNA. adjust antigen code whatever new variants arise?

P.S. totally irrelevant dental hygienist took temp cleaning teeth. said something like, phew! little worried cuz second dose running temperature past couple days (but fever broke last night).

she like, wow, sure brave getting experimental gene therapy stuff. smiled said I'm glad gotten it. proceeded tell 96 yo father almost died COVID. kept quiet cuz absolute last person want anger one pointy things mouth.

Oh man, tell it. Pre-corona trusted damn near religiously though unbiased one could (how naive), holy shit faith plummeted, anything say take grain salt, even that.

In reality, indicate may last several years. likely effective two years. may require 3rd booster could provide many years efficacy. likelihood based knowledge vaccines require semi regular boosters.

Lockdowns unlikely needed Britain learns treat coronavirus like flu, Prof Chris Whitty said.

The chief medical officer said 25,000 people die bad flu year without anyone noticing accepting Covid deaths would price keeping schools business open allowing people live ""whole life"".

Prof Whitty, speaking Royal School Medicine webinar, said Government would forced ""pull alarm cord"" dangerous variant arrived, people immunity sparked exponential growth.

""Covid going go away,"" said. ""You've got work what's rational policy would differentiate quite lot pandemic environment get seasonal flu.

""Every year, somewhere 7,000 9,000 citizens die flu, elderly, every years get bad flu year 20,000 25,000 die it. last time three years ago one noticed it.

""So clear going manage it, point, rather like manage flu. seasonal, dangerous disease kills thousands people society chosen particular way round it.""

Prof Whitty said important bring Covid deaths low possible, warned society would tolerate locked prevent similar numbers deaths flu.

""We want get close \[to zero\] question balance priorities?"" said. ""What people prepared put with? we've demonstrated last year flu want to, things we’ve done Covid led virtually influenza.

""If next year say 'we deal flu, everyone lock winter' think medical profession would make popular general public.

""We need work balance actually keeps low level, minimises deaths best can, way population tolerates, medical countermeasures like vaccines due course drugs, mean minimise mortality maximising economic social impacts fellow citizens.""

Prof Whitty said although would always measures could put place save lives, shutting schools universities preventing relatives visiting elderly care homes, restrictions prevented people living ""whole life"".

Asked Sir Simon Wessely, professor psychological medicine Institute Psychiatry, King's College London, whether lockdowns would reimposed cases rose, even local areas, Prof Whitty said: ""No, think so.""

However, added: ""Society tolerate certain number people ill, even know going go away come spring, area we're going pull alarm cord variant concern comes see back situation unconstrained growth immunological response there.""

Boris Johnson previously vowed current unlocking restrictions irreversible, next week Government determine whether shops reopen April 12 planned.

The latest figures Office National Statistics (ONS) show infections community continuing fall, dropping eight per cent week.

However, Mr Johnson warned last week cases rising Europe third wave may spread Britain continent. Latest data King's College ZOE symptom tracker app also suggests 'R' number may one, even areas. ONS warned cases may rising East England.

Prof Whitty said impossible prevent variants coming UK, argued shutting borders would unlikely prevent new infections.

The Government strongly criticised keeping borders open lockdowns, even though studies shown vast majority Britain’s cases imported countries like Spain Italy.

""We accept idea stopping variants coming UK realistic starting point, slow down,"" said. ""Anyone believes put border policy stops misunderstanding problem completely.

""While 'R' less one, two three months, new variants much foothold. start open things up, variant comes opportunity spread cases import quicker starting point. we’re trying slow down.”

Prof Whitty also said sensible keep ""open mind"" whether AstraZeneca vaccine caused blood clots proven otherwise. old people fully vaccinated mostly (which actually show data, average ICU patient significantly younger first wave), people still first dose grants immunity, tons people 1 dose getting sick. Sinovac effective safe, people tend ignore fact Chile bought historically influenza shots Sinovac... Chile going post summer back school/work March, pandemic fatigue huge, everyone tired, vaccines indeed working, need time. 90% country lockdown last week, hope vaccine effects start showing soon. judge Chile's numbers yet, early.

As strains, they're identified country small amounts, borders closed entirety April. add, Youyang Gu’s model predicted infections would rise point time infections would peak next Saturday. Given dude money, I’m willing bet, see cases decline then. got second dose appx 8:30 morning. appx 10 pm night take painkillers migraine. possible medicine messed vaccine? googled endlessly try find answer, everything says ""don't take painkillers vaccine"" nothing find says anything long before. 10 hours enough time medicine system? Totally defeats purpose using home tests catch transmission happens. Ok diagnosing prevention got mad brown people got vaccine jumped line.

How fucking sad. vaccinated 29% Texans. make fans present vax cards enter stadiums maybe I’m sure won’t Ain't truth. can't even believe comments I'm getting week Amazon's peeing bottle scandal. America, whether people want open eyes not. Scheduled appointment 4/11 NYC. next two weeks going absolutely massive!  No, misunderstood. ""at worst"" meant need new shot every year it. absolute, best case scenario would vaccine protects us years years indefinitely. Although vaccine working 6 months, far, definitely far ""worst"" case scenario. 

If say, vaccine's efficacy reported worded it. 

It would've better saying ""hey guys, know two-dose vaccine barely gave access 1/4 country far? lasts 6 months, time everyone gets it, vast majority who've received need somehow get it. Sorry. Lol.""

People average psychopath redditor hurr-durr-downvote want, vaccine serious pandemic barely lasting half year fucking scary. Started Pfizer’s see weeks would think. Companies also extra careful AstraZeneca swirl suppose people wanted got. Sucks American. Hey! Why’s everyone hostile?! I’m asking provocative, baseless questions ill-concealed attempt push specific point view?!

Pointing cognitive bias isn’t attacking you, point you’re trying deflect; like right now. seems like fragile ego bruised whip credentials, proverbial dick, onto table compensate, that’s speculation.

Dunning-Kruger bottom quartile overestimate knowledge. applied specific domain knowledge, intelligence whole, anything between. particular instance type see engineers. you’re well-educated knowledgeable particular area, think qualifies speak unrelated subjects domains. You’re top quartile one area doesn’t mean everywhere else, overestimate abilities anyway. It’s engineers fall woo time. mean, honestly, don’t even scientific background. Although know people got bad reaction shot 1 nothing 2. know people flu like symptoms shots. 

It hits everyone differently. Agreed - vaccination program big morale boost us. lot damage control done rear collective heads rubble. understand value work ethic, enduring illness nothing that. everyone experiences flu illnesses medical conditions way. Calling ""soft shit"" part problem. 

Now ability safely work home it. Perhaps lack perspective many people low wage ""essential"" jobs get luxury often paid sick days. However commend responsible things pandemic  Yeah, mine two days ago, follow Wed. took offered (after searching like 6 places offering them, refreshing hours).

Getting right weekend would ideal, that's everyone wants it. There's shortage vaccine general, let alone getting apt ""prime time"". Nice! able catch game summer! Unfortunately it’s even worse, I’m UK - excess deaths, lockdowns, financial instability; thing going us vaccine drive even wouldn’t say it’s greatest Turtles way down! zero evidence **so far**. I'm saying vaccine unsafe. I'm saying I've heard pregnant people say take vaccine vaccine tested pregnant people. test placebo group versus vaccinated group showed different miscarriages pregnancy problems versus placebo group I'd agree pregnant women/women wanting become pregnant taking would anti-science. stands, much harder prove vaccine causing negative effects live study pregnant people placebo group compare to. get people saying number people miscarry getting covid-19 vaccine line standard rates. 

And yeah, article focusing nurses want become pregnant pregnant. think among nurses pregnant women women want pregnant general population since majority nurses female that's wanted bring point. would say last sentence false vaccines many years study use show safe approved normal use whereas covid vaccines approved emergency authorization. Great. decade half ago, really moot problem point. Literally one admin still works there, fact, I'm pretty sure super dead.

And given circumstances time, absolutely putting position still looking permanent work. Call bad American, 22 years old market completely collapsed, ass concern, taking established school district. It’ll definitely increase. remember last year saying antibodies infection, length antibodies kept rising time give aid country refuses take action?

Yes, citizens suffering, world pay mediocre administration either. Bolsonaro plays ball international community, I'm helping. trying fix mistake doubles down. Successful lockdowns actually drop death rates compared normal: live Massachusetts teens get vaccines April 19th second wasn’t bad, low fever whole body hurt. Hard get comfortable  Married, kids. borrowed time there, hoping couple years need make child. 

I see ever ""retiring"" key enjoy life do. minor investments always looking new opportunities.

My succession plan hire manager handle day day operations business building paid afford that. I've built confidence managers ability operate sell business vender take back loan make easy take responsibility ownership. would continue collect rent monthly commercial space which, today's rates, enough. Yup. I’m cool mostly opening up, unnecessary exceptions like crammed concerts, think everyone continue mask public. It’s easy we’re pretty used point. Anyone doesn’t acting pretty selfishly.  I’m you! Really hoping doses come manufacturers openings expand.

According Bloomberg, three manufacturers missed end March plan. (Moderna million shy, Pfizer 20 million shy, don’t even want talk J&amp;J.)  data suggest things would happen? Coat, hat, gloves, scarf, hand foot warmers, blanket going today. Vaccination really picking Texas probably first day everyone eligible showing feel like I’m living another outlier Los Angeles. We’re steep drop cases we’re also recovering biggest surge country. It’s big drop think virus ran hosts certain areas. certainly isn’t behavior hasn’t changed months. mean kids - need that. like healthy ppl shouldn’t lock protect tiny portion people immune issues. getting insane. truly believe lot people covid induced OCD still people 65+ want vaccinated, 'correctly'. that, mean passively signing bajillion lists waiting someone call rather try actively get appointment rather get added list.

Already talked 2 separate unrelated people; 1 got appointment later day found couple places call. got vaccine already. jumped line bullshit like Lightfoot pulling. Since didn’t check, got friends family sign too. we’re mostly good get back life. go circle set. Unless Texas.. then.. well.. too, called back work. But, pandemic let put time cultivation skills, money I've saved going out, saves money making rosin. Yaaay live rosin. one said ""only 6 months"". evidence trial says vaccine high efficacy *at* 6 months, evidence high efficacy SA variant. means vaccine still working well likely continue working well future.

Bottom line: enjoy vaccinated life worry getting another appointment. think Founding Fathers ever imagined Facebook, Twitter massive Media Empires.

With that, really know solution individuals spreading lies massive audience little repercussions platforms use. old days, either stand corner deal ramifications said pay pamphlet produced distributed, might cost lot money. Now, make Twitter account Facebook account start putting message see gets picked up. really bare costs spreading message. Making videos go viral spread around Internet hours within possibility average person. come point Americans learn 1st Amendment first included Constitution. Downvote want, I’m proud, COVID-vaccinated citizen support 1A death.

Americans bit entillited comes Free Speech. worry one group people activity trying exterminate another. get places like Burma, parts Middle East Africa, one group spreading lies intent exterminating another group real issue. Military Junta Burma get free access send messages via Facebook WhatsApp does, thousands Rohingya might killed. Husband professor reviewer editorial board international journal.

It's honestly whole lot unlike this, paper anonymous (not boss), three reviewers (reviewer 2 allowed asshole), person submitted paper knows going probably wait month, crossing fingers get ""provisionally accepted; revisions required"" ""revise resubmit."" saying since started real bad got downvoted oblivion. close borders, one out, government capable handling vaccine roll send UN start vaccinating people. Rangers start 3, I'm real curious see many people show today. They're allowing max capacity even come close two soft opening games played earlier week.

If vaxxed, I'd there. is, gonna halfway May I'm covered Quote, Russian scientists, use vaccine prevent mutations virus, often occur inter-specific transmission pathogen"" 

Konstantin Savenkov, deputy director Federal Service Veterinary Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor)

And know, inclined agree that. Allowing virus freely mutate carnivores horrible. extremely lucky good job that, might easily change future. close gate, risking turning cats dogs natural coronavirus reservoir. India exported vaccine multiple times last month, near expiration date. something wrong administration vaccines there. seems getting point vaccine hesitancy stalling efforts south say southerner. Tbh surprised limit deep south 50-55% willing get vaccinated growing major concern here... hope eliminate short medium time, seems like uphill battle. Especially reading articles stating AZ 30% efficient P1... :( Media form right controlling flow information.

I would like submit article publishing /u/Quiet_Attention_243 's newspaper. Please let know submission deadline included tomorrow's paper. Yeah except lockdown suicides depressed teenagers don’t count... hope everything turns better eventually sounds like place piece shit. I've similar thing happen mental health related gave even less fuck. factory question dont believe ever released vial vaccine. was/is still undergoing FDA review. brace it? clench buttcheeks? think overlap demographics. 

Antivaxxer often Female, Middle Class, working, college educated - ""Whole Food demographic heavily represented Nursing profession. sad, surprising. answered great question good answer seems essentially Pfizer trying Israel getting data vaccinating population. getting lot good information Israel mass vaccination going including information people contract COVID vaccinated. data propriety Pfizer unless choose release expect much unless find concrete pattern.

Think way - vaccines effective made hard study COVID positive trial participants got vaccine would hard determine pattern. mass vaccinations continue would surprised data comes people catch COVID vaccinated. EU allows private companies export vaccines countries. US bans vaccine export. vulnerable population vaccinated point. ? Ny state? think know patients hospital then.

They almost vulnerable virus, like vaccinating work home middle school professor. Length immunity vaccine alone harder measure. exposure act like booster immune response vaccine starts, hard tell someone immunity (for example) two years vaccine worked long, exposed virus every three months period, body never stopped producing antibodies. true, think lot people unhealthy think are. know people said ""yeah guess i'm elligible I'm 'technically obese' roll eyes,"" I'm like yeah dude, obese real. high risk. moot. nursing home critical aortic stenosis severe biventricular heart failure stage 4 cancer age 90 etc living borrowed time.

Extremes age severe preexisting conditions absolutely considered severely lower life expectancy general could literally die time. 

It's clearly people died, lot counted covid even given 6 months live anyways. I'm fine that, irrelevant acknowledge that. complex topic appropriate try analyze simply.

But main point take minute think horrible heart disease is. kills 550k people every single year forever, majority deaths preventable diet lifestyle modifications. Cool response. Thanks. 

Some folks got rubbed wrong way story/theory.

I think things like ones posted tools learning understanding...so thanks good redditor person! literally first thing wrote. even quoted it.

I thought well known.... 29% protection asymptomatic infection British variant

Great. British variant reported infections area. I'm going offered vaccine offers whooping 29% protection catching asymptomatic COVID could pass baby can't wear masks take vaccines. can't even offered guarantees prefer wait another, according government ""vaccines yoghurts"" cannot choose. doses Pfizer. side effects enough keep home work. slightly uncomfortable day two, maybe bit tired. that’s it. Totally manageable. imagine would make sense gone, anti-vax troll. wasting breath time me. Everyone’s getting beta version vaccine rn.. I’m sure improve years go figure virus necessarily matter believing science, mean going medical school. situations better take epistemic approach realize everyone different agency risk/reward. Perhaps studied history remedies caused issues many years future something.

PS : antivaxxer much lower rate. Ideally continues going “for entirety life also protects stubbing toe” yet coronavirus much stable influenza. according article Pfizer vaccine protect variance. there’s that. Well that's real reason supposed keep masking. want ""class divide"" among unvaccinated/vaccinated. Germany several days vaccine. There's central database side effects. Thank summary! makes sound lot better initially thought. Ah typical god complex holier thou coward. surprised jumped conclusion believe morally superior literally everybody. 

Also hope raise kid balanced rational human being, else he'll fucking nightmare like you. Nah. Brazil happened dumbass leader deny Covid. Again, it’s directed you. It’s directed author article. That’s way I’m seeing it, maybe I’m wrong, doubt assuming everyone knows intricacies molecular biology. see may came arrogant especially added edit comment.  mean, it’s probably bad can’t smell it, right? Awesome. know lot people want hear this, really good news. vaccinated protected others.

Keep masking - know maintaining social order virus continues circulate among unvaccinated people. It'd nightmare manage people yelling they're immune to, jealousy unmasked people, etc. safe jabbed. Enjoy going society again! live immunocompromised individuals can't prevent transmission, worth me. know matter time, still nothing go still chance contrary evidence. I'm unemployed moment I'm going anywhere to. live city getting hold vaccine immediately available without fudging details. What's take this? true shit hole. Mutation major form immune evasion, way. Memory cells live forever, live long time (and many quality generated depend virus) time die could lose protective immunity pathogen seen even mutation.

I believe vaccines produce long term response based strong initial response is, fair conservative situation get caught surprise end naive population expect. Whaaaat?

Now timed money making ongoing vaccine? Source? Especially upvotes done random idiots. Like people expert couple things. Amazing often see comments upvoted know absolutely incorrect. 

Upvotes mean people like say, necessarily correct took ibuprofen daysss 😞 Agree that, news sides, seems vaccine fear, I’m sure gain is? Great, also go subscription way?.. hella allergies, asthma. think things tied overactive immune system. mention though, actually used get sinus/bacterial/infection/bronchitis-type illnesses (*especially* spring) started treatment. could count every spring, like clockwork. still get infections, though they’re generally less debilitating. keep top rest immune system tends take hit (cue UTIs, reason). Correct, human trials started late July 2020 IIRC. doesn’t vaccinate herself, treat others? downvoting doesn’t change said. you’re working patients, make sure you’re healthy it, otherwise defeats purpose caring others. 

but course, reddit. downvote shit makes sense. Died covid Covid? two distinctly different numbers. It’s that’s solid data for! Hell, I'd like see combat vaccine availability eligibility.

Leaving states determine bad idea concept, really dropping ball. Yes websites twitter handles could follow get vaccine scheduled, work average technology challenged person. personally know 3 people: 2 50s 1 30s currently positive traveled vacations (by plane) last two weeks first time pandemic: none vaccinated even 1st dose. One light symptoms (50), one moderate symptoms (30), one struggling (50).

There's never ""best"" time come novel disease, can't imagine worse time catch proven vaccines put arms tune 2-3 million per day. 

So true people ""giving up"" cautious still tragic people die get sick right finish line thing. agree you. REAL worry mutations, get adults, send every vaccine countries WAY behind vaccinating population. mutation come there, here. Kids WAY likely life altering affects everyday accidents, covid. Oh bet security clearance!!!! thought well known. learned stuff college studying molecular biology like 16-17 years ago. know news now...?

Why would well known someone study molecular biology? assume everyone took molecular biology?

My degree mechanical engineering, I'm dope, worked hard school (though long time ago), took lot classes I'll wager lot people didn't. Therefore, knowledge others don't. therefore expect knowledge act like shock don't.

Perhaps idiot strong, point arrogance still stands. tired mild fever &amp; headache pfizer shot #1 24 hours, delayed-onset stronger fatigue &amp; headache fever peaked 101.5 total length side effects lasting 36 hours, counting muscle soreness injection site.

&amp;#x200B;

it fun, i'm looking forward another round, much prefer getting real thing giving loved one. agree likely last longer six months, original comment wrong edit necessary.

And truly dependent virus long immunity actually lasts, actually worth studying sure. examples viruses produce long term durable responses even without evasion mutation. 

I agree CDC messaged conservative manner terms vaccines, making broad statements things understand leads waters muddied further.  That's contract ever gets signed. sure sought approval yet either? hard stereo type exhibit characteristic lack empathy present certain, easily identifiable portion population mixed constant victim mentality.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* TBF, article saying anything shutting society children vaccinated. saying kids vaccinated ASAP gives lot reasons try get parents get kids vaccinated ASAP time comes despite major risk children themselves. mean you’ve COVID recovered, natural antibodies effective 6 months? think right they’re saying 3 months curious. people qualifications drive find better jobs. people aren’t scientists, though. there’s terrible issue messaging since march 2020 yes. get fucking shot already dentists absolutely exist. “Biological Dentistry” Yeah. That’s happens media completely biased mostly focused criticizing another country. media misled Europeans think good behavior could beat virus. Except you’d need draconian lockdowns closed borders actually beat covid. Oh deer She’s nurse, head World Health Organization. personal opinions way effect ability work injured sick people since job requires objective procedure testing patients. read article would see **supports** others get vaccine thinks vaccines ultimately good thing. zero side effects Pfizer shot, even sore arm. relief read something worrying me.  know sucks, to. get shot friday (or whatever day weekend is).

&amp;#x200B;

fwiw, probably six months, might 1 2 years. original 4 week interval study read prelim data little back, numbers symptomatic good, real world data excellent, longer interval gave AZ vaccine greater overall efficacy. guidance working getting vaccine? I'm currently think 1 1-1/2 hour gap vaccine workout. Unless there's consensus suspect within years we’ll getting flu coronavirus vaccines annually, either two separate shots, one combined. sounds like something would say anyway  really need stop looking social media information.

Random person 1: ""Here's statement fact""

Random person 2: ""Actually that's wrong""

Random person 1: ""No actually right"" Yup! even counting towards March deliveries anyways. yep. seriously medical benefits care suck compared rest world. Summary

### Background

A new variant SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, emerged dominant cause COVID-19 disease UK November, 2020. report post-hoc analysis efficacy adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), variant.

### Methods

Volunteers (aged ≥18 years) enrolled phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies UK, randomly assigned (1:1) receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs weekly basis also developed symptoms COVID-19 disease (a cough, fever 37·8°C higher, shortness breath, anosmia, ageusia). Swabs tested nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples sequenced COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses measured using live-virus microneutralisation assay B.1.1.7 lineage canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 seronegative participants NAAT positive swab 14 days second dose vaccine. Participants analysed according vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy calculated 1 − relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 *vs*MenACWY groups) derived robust Poisson regression model. study continuing registered [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/), [NCT04400838](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04400838), ISRCTN, 15281137.

### Findings

Participants efficacy cohorts recruited May 31 Nov 13, 2020, received booster doses Aug 3 Dec 30, 2020. 8534 participants primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) aged 18–55 years 5065 (59%) female. Oct 1, 2020, Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose throat swabs collected participants trial. these, 401 swabs 311 participants successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity vaccine-induced antibodies lower B.1.1.7 variant Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2–11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy symptomatic NAAT positive infection 70·4% (95% CI 43·6–84·5) B.1.1.7 81·5% (67·9–89·4) non-B.1.1.7 lineages.

### Interpretation

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity B.1.1.7 variant compared non-B.1.1.7 variant vitro, vaccine showed efficacy B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2.

### Funding

UK Research Innovation, National Institute Health Research (NIHR), Coalition Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley South Midlands NIHR Clinical Research Network, AstraZeneca. shit Microsoft Surface 14 days vax. Works perfect. conflating safety efficacy. April fools!!!! mistake shut health resource platform conflict. Irresponsible. Well truth there, early months virus reporting test highly unreliable. one point saying anyone ever coronavirus would test positive. assumption test gotten dramatically better kinds stories painted people’s perceptions tests early on. See, happens don’t share vaccines like EU, exported 70.000.000 vaccines. Counties like US UK didn’t export Single approved vaccines. understanding well, viruses constantly mutate, eventually vaccine generated antibodies cut relevent strain anymore...but could take years. argument holds absolutely water. OK like car mechanic refuses brake jobs dentist root canals. bill insurance administering vaccine. cost you. body choice. surprised consequences decision cause able participate fully society.

There's need bring race component here. making yet another antivax excuse, trying way make anyone arguing look insensitive best racist worst. Stop. transparent. got vaccinated foreign travel. Lmao headline pic TL;DR - Yes gf friend see anyone March October. Mid 30s healthy. met gf first person met person entire time. demanded stay outside six feet apart masks entire time. Ironically still ended catching corona despite months later. Apparently hospitalized well. Makes wonder vitamin deficient staying inside much always mask outside may played part. allergies ? would thought dampening immune response would also dampen allergies too? honest God debate someone great it'll chip floating around post-vaccine. small backyard bbq, everyone fully vaccinated, standing 20ft apart, also wearing 3 masks 

but even someone call murderer /s Keep virtual option schools end year parents teachers concerned kids spreading it. Gives parents want stay home protect kids can’t work home another round stimulus checks.

Let childfree people business usual majority fully vaccinated. EU sharing vaccines either. Unless think anything created private company automatically ownership state. I’ve read isn’t really thing vaccines. Side effects would’ve already shown point. view it’s riskier wait take chance getting COVID get vaccine. Lmao what? going keep restrictions forever then? last sentence real.

After reading threads whole pandemic though ""if much misinformation spread upvoted something understand, must things understand""

Social media good sharing fun videos memories, great nuanced discussions topics. major problem, there's nuance reddit, everything options usually wrong bigger cities counties like Austin Travis County still mask mandates, FYI. 

See also: Texas ended mask mandate, event cancellations started — losses adding Yea thats exactly it, longer revert statutory sick pay pretty low. also account 28 days holiday get year uses antigen Adenovirus vehicle.

mRNA without vector virus really want break simple elements. It’s definition job. There’s always worrying strain existing virus (dangerous flu strains), new exotic virus remote land might arrive soil (Ebola, Zika) antibiotic resistant bacteria general danger new diseases making jump animals. It’s literally enough field keep plenty experts busy engaged worried full time. last much longer. They're careful data yet. Sorry confusion, replied wrong comment last night. I'm skeptical able drop mask restrictions vaccinated people yet, seems early still spread even vaccinated one state age 45 eligible morning. essential workers state age 45. That's dipshit, that's system letting workers down.

Luckily, today opened anyone good luck getting appointment. Maybe. Maybe not. 

Shot 1 didn’t phase shot 2 took day. profession? definitely norm. ...how getting 30% adults 80-90% individuals 2-3 weeks? people also get unlucky side effects. Lockdowns no. worth it. 

Masks? Yes. They’re totally easy. lingering problems hands kids vaccinating, anti-vaxxers, vaccines 100%, need get cases way cut risk new variants might wreck vaccine efficacy. vaccine works get second shot 3-4 weeks later, get it. Busier, yes. Overwhelmed, no. reference Michigan total 26.5k beds Good lord, talk disinformation soup. 12 week gap, AZ completely fine variants, especially UK variant, data Scotland England shown. fact, real world data shows it’s actually superior mRNA vaccines. much, mind, they’re absolutely fantastic.

J&amp;J certainly fine well, there’s zero reason be.

I’ve seen spread disinformation before, ask again: employer? 6 months untenable Man, vaccine buffet!

I find I'm one-of-each kind guy. Nobody got second shot AZ yet since suppose delayed 9-12 weeks started February.

Also unclear plan people already first shot. might change 3 times then... never said lasts forever, settle down. Considering there's growing argument people infected need one dose, surprised decided people need one dose hypothetical annual shot. truly get it, I'm actually one optimistic colleagues whole time. long conversation wife last night pissed CDC's messaging seemingly clear plan get close. really lot reason hope vaccines going ticket this.

This also great time try educate immunology too, lot weird ideas people immune system works half truths old wives tales whatever good time try challenge future since everyone actually interested. They're ruined. Never shipped. think grander point thread lot headlines incomplete, unnecessary, contribute people getting vaccinated. Chinese vaccine strategy working really well Hungary Chile. better wait better vaccines coming summer. Wow! would've thought complicated internet sign-up pages would bad way distribute vaccines needed old people! ""vaccine-corps"" going around jabbing people like Polio. go post office without ending shot! Take damn upvote. vaccine drive company J&amp;J becomes available. 600 employees offered plus spouses vaccination. far 16 signed up. people simply don’t trust and/or don’t want vaccine constantly boosted. 2,200 coronavirus patients statewide hospitalized, figure doubled since beginning March. Five hospitals Henry Ford system Detroit area total 75 coronavirus patients week March 8; Tuesday, hospitals 267 patients. Monday, health system announced would reinstate policy limiting visitors several hospitals, response latest surge. ... virus November also side effects 2 days 1st shot. hoping 2nd shot side effect free. Hey, least German government accidental April Fool's joke loke Polish one did. They've opened vaccinations 40+ today, said mistake moving registrations second half May. totally normal scared getting shot.

If story scared you, Covid19 horror stories scare less? I'd much rather get vaccine. It’s insane big difference is. third winter kid daycare. first two years, spent solid three months winter sick least 50% time. year? Nothing. haven’t sick once, even kid still daycare amount. 

Turns always preventable. knew? Bro one made statement ""I always get silence ask 1 50 looks like hundreds millions"".

You're damn right 330 million infections, contagious virus may be, contagious. 

But posit someone virus infect 1/3rd Americans, infected, 2% die, us take odds. that's exactly dealt. measures place reduce transmission much possible; yes. exactly done.

My whole point replying overzealous doom casting harmful trying downplay severity virus. OK. Good getting vaccine. tell exactly NZ going - what’s point rushing programme easily wait get good stuff fight variants again? 

I know that's NZ covert strategy, might be, NZ vastly different spot Europe, UK US, need vaccines *right now* save people's lives. summer, longer shortage vaccines viral circulation low, we'll definitely able change strategy definitely see mRNA vaccines prioritized. 

Unfortunately cannot afford right now. even NZ risky position never know whether new outbreak emerge rapidly spiral control, especially new variants incoming colder season. chances Chicago opening sooner May 1 high 85 degree day February. Everyone know city car ventured far Quincy Danville get shots. inaccurate they? 

I feel though inaccurate would harmful everyone. People barely follow mask rule bars cities barely look like there’s pandemic going on. 

If people got hold they’ll take it’s negative go even wild coronavirus vaccine produce antibodies like vaccines.. statement true. article: recent cases per capita state, seen soar recent weeks, 5,300 cases day 1,000 Feb. 21. nation’s top three metro areas recent cases per capita Michigan: Jackson, Detroit Flint.  absolutely alarming,” Emily Toth Martin, epidemiologist University Michigan School Public Health, said week. “Looking numbers yesterday felt like gut punch. We’re going go surge, hard work again, get numbers down.” 2,200 coronavirus patients statewide hospitalized, figure doubled since beginning March. Five hospitals Henry Ford system Detroit area total 75 coronavirus patients week March 8; Tuesday, hospitals 267 patients. Monday, health system announced would reinstate policy limiting visitors several hospitals, response latest surge. said significant increase hospitalizations state people 50s, group still risk becoming severely ill dying Covid-19. Younger people driven rapid increase cases recently, said, including high school students participate sports contracted virus activities. people believe “one life lost many” think keeping measures longer means save everybody, even though last year already proved that’s possible. got appointment today choice 3, went J&amp;J. idea 1 done appealing efficacy rises level that's closer Moderna/Pfizer 56 days. 1. Im telling trust me

2. anecdote unreliable source. makes less reliable news watch Tell Lie vison? Troll? 

How questions good faith? antivaxxer tired people claiming scientists real scientific experience.

You claim 100% clear accurate grasp reality never true anyone. Yes! also Sinovac chance approval since trials conclusive yet. Sputnik give us doses, mainly Q2 (in Q3 supply issue, matter people think) think leave house get groceries. parents symptoms got assume age thing I'd like know EU rollout could sped vaccines. 
 
Most actions EU could've done better, done 3-6 months ago. supporting expanded production capacity ensure plans AstraZeneca. 
 
It unfortunate EU make sufficient backup plans, really ought shamed for. companies failed sufficiently warn failure deliver help accountable well. pay dearly. guaranteed PTO retaliation, shift workers would able easily access vaccine. ones driving transmission. simple EO would done that. Guess US cant waste paper. think : lightyears ahead use comes vaccine rollout. deeply ashamed annoyed living EU moment. first two comments (idk said elsewhere, stalk people's comments) mentioned nothing able get vaccine yet living immunocompromised people. could said get go, framed 'argument' terms enough information. comment continue add ""reasons"" can't/won't get shot. time argue constantly shifting goal posts. hope get available, hope get sick meantime. didn’t read article. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

Challenge studies monkeys look [*really show strong immunity, [sterilizing multiple vaccine types. We're still figuring much sterilizing immunity expected current vaccines, though starting look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, [that would end worse hedge least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've 

Stay, strong, get lazy staying safe, [you'll regret Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even shittiest masks seem work, [but Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.


Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something... side effects vaccine:

Nobody saying side effects. clearly side effects. I'm even saying side effects vaccine could last years. effects infection may show while, [and know last long notably loss sense smell.

I'm saying we'd find side effects within months. side effects suddenly show six months vaccination already shown people.

If example side effect vaccine side effects seen within first four months suddenly found four months post-vaccination, I'd change wording post.

I'll tell though, I've still gotten example vaccine side effect show least people way vaccine administered.

I get plenty ""look, vaccine used decades ago tiny country rarely causes one long-term side effect, wrong"", address point I'm making. worry, say severe reaction impossible, we're talking 1 millions here. take much larger gambles probably amounts daily basis. eyes real? understanding side effects beyond normal EXTREMELY rare. casual reader sub. let experts answer. would like say, thank right thing general population yourself, regardless motives. Cheers! forget: ones USA ones get media. see things like anti-mask protests countries like Germany well excited - nobody knows long term effects yet.
You still get covid also like many others getting yet media talk much sub block anyone posting it. Show information know effects vaccine.

You scientist right? expert scientific methodologies inherent bias variables you? Please share fount wisdom. Pfizer Moderna highly effective 2 weeks first shot. 

I believe saying accurate vast majority population. someone truly high risk, eligible vaccine months now, gotten shot yet, that's them. might emergency approval covid vaccines. someone side effects want vaccines possibly cause. covid vaccine becomes annual thing likely could get time. companies even trying combine shot already. parents live Europe early 60s still gotten vaccine. Meanwhile I'm early 30s living US I've gotten first Moderna dose. Oh that's excellent point. places I've seen topic discussed, first person point animal reservoir. People got absolutely buried last year even hypothesizing seasonality might significant COVID, sure seems like case. Maybe ""like miracle, disappear"" garbage parroted last year, definitely huge impact overall spread virus. virus mutating fairly rapidly. couple years might still robust immunity original virus much immunity version currently circulating (similar flu) suspect worst case scenario efficacy would sit 61% whatever single dose number is? Sorry, know Chicago someday April 16th May 1st Chicago? thought Chicago already said May 1st. Anyone know Chicago open sooner? quite. order enough, although orders later been. 
 
The EU ordered several times required amount needed vaccinate entire population. 
 
What failed consider badly AstraZeneca would fail deliver. could also done help build production capacity vaccines. states never true ""lock down"" restrictions many states gone since May 2020. way hell ever lock US. You’re one that’s circles. said nurses don’t get vaccine shouldn’t allowed work due getting others sick. agreed that. made beliefs said nurses don’t actively support vaccine shouldn’t allowed work. disagreed said beliefs way effects job performance. went back said would healthy, get vaccine would leave greater risk sick, nothing beliefs all. Unless you’re still stuck nurse getting vaccine we’re talking two different things.  heard pick bootstraps though. 

But I’m saying *if* there’s opportunity switch jobs... current employer doesn’t deserve loyalty. bit different since ship got stuck Sues Canal caught sandstorm. wasn’t like human error caused get stuck. situation could MUCH worse. mixup seems like human error completely. think it’s least partly due different regions waves different times.

I don’t see coincidence Northeast hit hard March-April region hit hard last year. people interested traveling outside county. But, yes, challenge second half 2021 much stick use. worries need apologize, expert field get it. I'm trying say ignore CDC guidelines everyone take masks anything like that, think really shitty year there's reason optimistic, we're lied anything things looking pretty good based know. absolutely need so. doses coming mRNA vaccines, J&amp;J AZ (barring delays) enough vaccinate everyone willing August latest. Sputnik Sinovac, albeit effective, little political drama. mistake plant Baltimore manufacturing two coronavirus vaccines, workers accidentally conflated ingredients, could also increase anxiety. 15 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine contaminated mix-up, delaying future shipments Johnson &amp; Johnson doses United States. 
 
If want increase anxiety, really need point none doses J&amp;J vaccine administered far affected. Baltimore production facility yet contributed national supply vaccines. director going sob tell us scared is? /s Stop trying. people entrenched idea scientific thinkers reality, 99% never picked book. knowledge idea epistemology, think plainly black white view.

I time find powerpoint slides, Immunology class grad school showed certain vaccines provide resistance decades others years declined efficacy. Thank you, really informative answer.

Just whilst we're here, whilst big animal reservoir, would big human reservoir effect? can't see vaccines getting poorer countries meaningful way time soon, would breeding ground strains? Phew I’m facing pfsier shot tomorrow. Wish luck coronavirus special risk category immune compromised people? communicable disease there. take standpoint everyone locked pose risk immune compromised, would basically put everyone permanent quarantine. state zero risk never standard living America, place.

Again, staunchly pro vaccine, COVID, anything else vax for. However, can’t locking away people don’t certain vaccines. made informed choice accepted risk. purposefully unvaccinated people free get virus deal it. get immunity anyway, problem solves itself. Locking millions people protect handful people theoretically want vaccine, can’t take absurd. announcement causing panic, poor reading comprehension people spreading misunderstanding is.

I believe responsibility held combat misunderstanding instead generating outrage.

I'm done outrage panic. decide freedom. fucking chance national state level. worst time catch COVID probably airlifted hospital 200 miles away rest full.

They given much life time something even helped achieving normality. 

I'm baffled understand that. lost numerous studies prove point easy find here. Look don’t want vaccine fail genuine evidence suggesting one better surely one would want, it’s rocket science. need sometimes change tack accept wrong, British people rather incredibly stubborn nationalistic pride overtaken entire debate around AZ. staunch supporter AZ early time gone evidence come it’s patently clear it’s job long term; good getting us started don’t see it’s place future get access mRNA - really it’s ok vaccine falter hold competition, Oxford university ok, ok, AZ might (but that’s PR disaster). [got squint see Certainly nothing like seeing October-November.  Countries like Canada zero domestic production vaccines ones blamed. depend Europe feed vaccines Europe threatens block exports vaccinate people Canada pulls strings behind scenes keep pressure on. Stop lying read data yourself. employer? I’m getting sense aim either July 4th start school year, restrictions left masks public large gatherings, maybe full wrap Thanksgiving/Christmas. Russian flu epidemic late 19th century likely caused similar coronavirus gives people common cold.

We fine. Find better job quarenteen 4 different times last year, due son exposed school. fiancee brain tumor take days due that. went 7 days PTO first quarenteen period. time take fiancee, missing many docs apts for, told ""you're PTO dont really unpaid time here"". meeting told HR would work bot worry it. Two days Thanksgiving spiked 102.5 degree fever texted manager ask do. told ""you decide sick work"", say I'm willing come want fever I'm allowed work I'm going go doctor let know doc says. 3 hours later I'm literally doctors office manager calls me, I'm literally speaking doctor let go voice mail. 10 seconds later calls pick say ""Hey Mark I'm talking doctor office right now-"" get cut ""you absent x number days employment (extremely large defense contractor) longer needed."" Glee dripping every word piece shit spews forward. point meeting absences given ok take it. get told call HR do, told made mistakes computer system never trained use. 4 shots year

Um, people know basic mathematics? That's I've hearing friends.

One friend Covid early (last March) warned first shot would kick ass, rather second, effectively booster shot her.

I suppose ""kick ass"" better defined ""a modestly unpleasant 24 hours"". Canada’s better Europe. issue vaccinated going stupid crap. assume everyone know personally shot. Sums idiotic approach whole thing short-sightedly turned closing schools ""proper"" lockdown big political boast. Now, incredibly predictably, measures necessary, embarrassing him, harder get people accept them. mean it’s kind insane me, like non zero chance something bad happening enough permanently alter way everyone lives, logic often given (variants!) really extended perpetually, like there’s hundreds variants since last March? don’t matter that’s benchmark kill fam lmao.

It obviously made sense alter lived last year, covid many people risk best taken, wasn’t still could contribute risk, it’s delirious doom thought.  say see anti-vaccine stance? live town cows outnumber humans. single murder since 2005, also pharmaceutical industry speak of...

*I bot, action performed automatically.

I would interested see prevalent ""no sick days"" employment statistics are, trying get previous post. ""seem"" right ""most"" Americans receive sick days, sata back up. hope first jab 6 months. sure. worry nitty gritty get immunity, right it’s important get everyone safe.  TX vaccinated 29% people per CDC, yeah people still going infected. likely good news P1 (Brazilian) variant similar mutations. NJ hospitalizations going up. Yeah mostly kills fat people Sweden think fine Look I’m fully vaccinated far I’m concerned pandemic me. I’m going back regular life. I’ll still obey local regulations without complaining that’s it. 4-5 months makes sense. would see transmission dropping well then. looks like natural immunity year ago worn off

That pretty large conjecture right Given data/trajectory Israel statements administration, feel like trying ""wrap thing up"" July 4th (though memorial day feel pretty normal), guideline compliance plummeting cities I've noticed even strictest places (testing sites, airports) really care anymore. think canadians EU feel exports going dictator instead them?  2 differences have. said career 25 years, going change perception company. I'm like you, take need questions asked. everyone lives like us though. believe CDC director might misspoke yesterday said vaccinated people don’t carry virus, don’t get sick it’s clinical trials, it’s also real world data. found hard believe, would mean vaccines 100% efficacious, know aren't. 

I read morning. CDC study referring to, concluded ""Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (≥14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status"" 

If headline true individual basis would expect see zero covid mortality hospitalization full immunized individuals account covid infection impossible. occurred region. Israel reports cases hospitalizations vaccinated population. 

Overall likelihood infection detection massively lower (and reduction viral load shedding demonstrated.) certainly help bring end pandemic compounding effects wide rollout. suggestion vaccinated person's straight ""cannot carry"" virus already debunked based phase 3 data. That's vaccines reported 100% efficacious, people developed symptomatic covid post dose 2. check see test actually works first Earth would take 4-5 months ""sign"" transmission dropping? real question is, show. There’s plenty tickets still available OP talking sick days though

Sick days =/= holiday days many people topics keep saying last years know cause x z saw linus tech tips. No. Six months now. stop lying ourselves. may longer, may not. 29% TX vaccinated assume anyone doesn’t want infected won’t go packed stadium you’re kind right. lucky. many people went Florida, picked up, registered cases home states. Master Government, paying taxes! feel like every week there's new rapid test approved changes nothing Ding ding ding.... winner dystopic thing said today.

""Keep paying us want get pneumonia every year."" TURTLE!!! wrong. thing that's certain very, confused. get take openly anti-vaccine stance say 'actually I'm pro-vaccine', expect anyone take seriously.   ZeroCovid cultists still won’t accept real. Tortise folks. turtle. fear-mongering. Stop terrified communism. swear God feel like I'm back damned 80s every time talk fox news watcher lately. loosened restrictions didn’t they?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's straight douchebag comment. guess expect sub though? depends job/company. Generally speaking, white collar jobs fine taking time work long get shit done (many places even care use PTO, extent). However, hourly workers tend treated much strictly get fired showing even 5 minutes late many times. Reason low skill work looked (""if job fuck need micromanaged"") seen trivially replaceable (""I saw look phone, fired, maybe replacement starts next week better"").

Also, employers US can't fire medical reasons, *can* fire without cause. long explicitly say ""you're fired ill"" 100% legal. ""Pfizer/Moderna appear likely much better long term options""

No. according real world data. There's real difference play here.

""it’s proven Pfizer/Moderna better next threat variants""

No hasn't? There's even threat begin moment.

""Just vaccine British""

Couldn't care less.

Who employer? Yes.

This backdoor way gain access R&amp;D. every pharmaceutical company ability manufacture mRNA vaccines. would allow catch up. think get content? think overstating generalizing personal experiences. March 2020, 78 percent civilian workers had access paid sick leave that's one category, private similar levels government even higher. saying room improvement comment false. FKIN REKT would require virus completely evolve something else infects without spike. 

Would tests even able detect that? least Japan guaranteed paid leave that's government mandated... Pfizer says vaccine synonymous Moderna since mRNA based vaccines? apologies nuanced/stupid question believe expected. Lymph nodes critical fighting disease infection makes sense swell, tender, like symptoms.  Play Jaja ding dong! Avoid reposting information, quite bit ago. I'd say concern vaccinated people well. pandemic situation still one that's development helps continue pushing narrative caution, especially face many shown woeful disregard public safety. Yeah does. Like instead saying ""I'm gonna kill you"" could say ""I'm gonna take life away"" make way better.

/s

In Lyon here, nobody cares anymore rules. Use good masks social distance that's it. isn’t really anti-vax all, please explain supporting better vaccine anti-vax slightest? that’s point right? strategy works time, ofc UK/EU/USA need act fast wait wouldn’t wait better choice? 

Moderna probably make big buck got worse performing vaccines need booster, think rich countries (unless strange sense pride) AZ probably dead boosters unless somehow getting AZ means can’t get mRNA vaccine - even UK investing Curevac mRNA booster shots way optimistic it’s like lack critical thinking ? Fachj lost credibility months ago. staggering silence border crisis huge number Covid positive cases clearly speaks volumes. really consider protection two weeks second shot. need let guard close finish line. Sounds like going need get annual Covid shot.

And considering unlikely relatives going actually year, Thanksgiving officially sucks ever. evidence deadlier every vaccine tested effective. Hold horses. one thing coordinate global effort vaccinate everybody current strain. another global effort give everybody booster shots next strains. Brazil closing daily deaths would like 6,000 people dying day US...  That's 13 month long study based people 50 years old. First data arrive June. don’t see could allowed without human trials first. again, scientists know I. could safe effective say. I’m glad United States following guidelines set makers vaccines. wife gets second dose Pfizer tomorrow, get second dose next Friday. Oh God mean totally dependant alot things like company work for. saying right shit lots Americans roaming malls 2pm people get time off. couldnt doctors dentists, banks others would hold hours directly overlap average work day would bankrupt.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s vaccines work 6 months ago. Since started working home needed fill daily log, weekly log, two monthly logs did. found higher paying job.

UPDATE: left told unprofessional us fill work logs UK human trials sequence data soon. needs highlighted. Wooo! Can’t wait go June visit dback stadium see baseba!!! Hmm think possible although weird member family exposed many days tested positive EU make production lines exporting vaccine, happen borders. Vaccine production zero-sum game, EU acted months countries already started working fleshing production. Subscriptions everything nowadays. We’ll see. really hope it’s earlier vaccine high demand here. appointments Mass booked least month - it’s way since February. kind demand going get worse it’s open adults. don’t see wouldn’t get shot June/July numbers.

I’m guessing Mass get 90% vaccinated. Absolutely everyone state wants replaceable

This truth low/no skilled jobs. need unions replaced anytime...problem machines starting jobs now. Nope, choice would private company able that? like showing ID enter bar. worried bar control information ID? good thing got moderna. *cough, sht need sort storage first ability revolutionary - moment mRNA vaccines global solution - hopefully changes time lower price tech (which doubt) expect put Ursula von der Leyen, incompetent politician Germany store, top EU commission? women position minister defence effective destruction German forces WWII allies. feel this...making 90K wife barely afford 2 kids, part house, car. sucks amount need make live. arm pain weird. 6 hours day bad enough make difficult lift arm. next day completely gone. Vice President got Moderna. shame Americans get shafted much get paid per hour. work twice much get pennies. long virus exists somewhere, new variants risk, whether pop Brazil, Belarus Zimbabwe. really makes difference. doubt anyone would happy country giving vaccines country willingly mismanaged pandemic. Hell, I'd argue significant amount EU citizens already pretty annoyed many vaccines they're giving away, lot countries necessarily need help.  vaccines still offer solid asymptomatic protection 

Has similar study mRNAs weekly swabs post vaccination? Would grateful could post link. father got exposed Thursday, developed symptoms Sunday, tested negative Wednesday, finally tests positive. symptoms 4 days tested positive. There's lot J&amp;J shots made available yet. CDC data vaccines administered nationwide 2.3% hear, guess I’ll find react 21 days. dont data yet. Id choose Pfizer available vaccines choice. fact POTUS vaccinated Pfizer NIH-Moderna kinda says something Apparently needs children vaccinated go back normal 🙄 AstraZeneca vaccine recently recommended people 60 protect Corona. head Standing Commission Vaccination, Thomas Mertens, told Der Spiegel younger people received initial vaccination AstraZeneca would recommended ""that receive second, so-called heterologous, vaccination RNA vaccine BioNTech. Animal data show immune response heterologous vaccination.""

Well great. basically Germany going large scale study (2.2 million people) mixing vaccines based animal research data. inspires confidence me! Apparently still take AZ risk 60. I'll think it, since AstraZeneca proven works. I'm also worried countries accept mix full immunization could make travel harder. vaccines reduce serve disease dramatically never 100% - hence still see thousands deaths like flu every year. someone clarify ""health system collapse"" means, practice?

Sick people storming capacity hospitals like zombies   places get away unemployed worker can't afford fight it. too! higher level science classes college botany, amazing learn cellular processes *don't* involve chlorophyll. one anywhere seriously suggesting vaccine passport required live normal life.

They're using J&amp;J Washington? Remember Cuomo killed bunch old people. I’m sorry went that. country fucked deserve much better. hope job physical mental health supported! yoghurt after? Pfizer Moderna done similar study weekly swabs post vaccination? know better asymptomatic B 1.1.7.?

and vaccine protect asymptomatic infection mean prevent transmission significantly. know, could close 100%. people incompetent dangerous governments like this? also idiots charge Greece citizens actually anything media government-friendly opposition nowhere seen? lawyers build case remove government power disastrous mishandling? Story seems unrelated, swear ties point. I'm defense contracting, program's job warn soldiers short range rocket mortar going land base, take cover. first rolled out, warning threshold set 1 1000- 0.1% chance rocket mortar would land base, sent alert. thought safe, actually- wasn't. 

It take long soldiers take warning seriously. many false alarms. So, alarm went off, time, nothing happened, soldiers stopped taking cover. then, rocket hit, none took cover, people died. 

So, raised threshold. Now, may ""leakage"" rocket lands warn on, rare, every time alarm goes off, people take cover. So, even missing shot two, we're better less cautious, human nature cannot defeated. 

So, blame messaging CDC Fauci, human mistake make, feel like they've conservative, little worst case scenario, messaging, eventually, people tune out. best guess quite time vaccines prevent someone spreading last long time, pessimistic messaging around it, there's lot people think vaccine almost worthless. subside within 24-48 hours even occur overwhelming majority antibody doesnt start waning 3-5 months. Also, younger individuals innate response quite strong shouldnt depend solely it. P3 trial reached endpoint 3 months expected everyone vac group really good protection spreading via aerosols. Turned relevant initially believed - got second Moderna yesterday 1:30pm around 2am started feel awful headache body aches. It’s 3:20pm headache gone feel light headed still super run down. can’t wait passes

I hope feel better! Sounds like you’re speaking experience California, they’re still working backlogs several months ago. German Vaccination Comission recommends people 60 received first shot AstraZeneca take second shot mRNA vaccine. second vaccine dose younger persons already received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, scientific evidence yet safety efficacy heterologous vaccination series. appropriate data available, STIKO recommends administering one dose mRNA vaccine 12 weeks initial vaccination place second AstraZeneca vaccine dose persons aged &lt;60 current knowledge, basic immunization started must completed product. exception made persons aged &lt;60 years already received initial vaccination AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. individuals, recommended dose mRNA vaccine administered 12 weeks initial vaccination lieu second AstraZeneca vaccine dose. rationale protection elicited single AstraZeneca vaccination begins decline 12 weeks. STIKO recommends study investigating immunological effects following heterologous vaccination schedule.

If me, would take unproven second mRNA shot? biggest worry approved national level. doubt safety immunization levels all. Would able travel outside Europe received mix vaccines (would US example recognize full immunization)? Babies risk hundreds things deadly covid - important thing getting sick AZ stop make valid points I’m sure America finished vaccinated, soon, ‘preference’ whoever money shove Pfizer/Moderna’s face plus ramping production every week - imagine couple months significantly less issues supply. It’s trade off, stick AZ (continual) results effectively useless suppressing spread variants true back square 1 virus still circulating killing people wait bit get everyone vaccinated vaccine proven work bother. seen quickly variant spread btw already see ZA variant uptick - it’s something ignore. 

The point Autumnal boosters another one ‘worry later’ problems, easy say stuck inside waiting another vaccine shot another lockdown due variant spreading opinion quickly change you’re giving accurate information. You’re giving biased outlook said unvaccinated friends unpleasant side effects asymptomatic cases understand ""lasts *at least* 6 months"" means. automatically assume lasts 6 months really 6 months data currently Meanwhile, Michigan: 

""For state whole, seeing increases travel nonessential trips outside home approaching pre-pandemic levels,"" Petrie said.

It's confirmed. last 24 hours studies showing vaccines strong variants, long lasting, effective kids. CDC least beginning start admitting vaccines mean don’t get **and**you don’t spread it. 

And everyday another 3 million get jab. mean, good news around us, folks. someone flies New York Michigan, would nice quarantined. wait employer must moron. wont let take 2 hours every 6 months could get covid miss 2 - 4 weeks possibly even die lol Unfortunately recent studies enough data determine it.  area without variant probably nothing worry hard believe offers protection severe disease given essentially protection infection SA variant.

Right. antibody test positive covid infection. I’m sure 2 false negatives test doesn’t detect antibodies produced result vaccine. article full contradictory statements.

""Fully vaccinated people don’t get sick"", except three got sick trials.

“Vaccinated people around unvaccinated people even without masks distancing” “Not public don’t know vaccinated not”  idea medical research works, thus idea talking about.

Again, sad  They’ll let need get work done.. Yes, is. 

I'm hoping well, Brazil capable vaccinate population similarly US, issue low amount doses doctors said

You listening experts topic, facebook fanatics. wisdom. Many people listening unfounded fears, needlessly putting others risk. don’t doubt it’s cheap costs fairly negligible rich governments it’s bit moot point. It’s fairly effective UK wonder much attributed harsh lockdown also really interested see growth variants here. person stated above, create selective pressure vaccine escape mutations thrive don’t prevent infection Ahem...who's got ""binary ideological thinking"" now?

Again, sad. Brazil population roughly 2/3rds size US, deaths hit bit harder US deaths hit US. Per capita they've actually surpassed US peak. help government done anything meaningful alleviate suffering. matter time another variant comes that's far dangerous current variant. want thing done already.  think health organization going try keep people dying. president spent nine months lying severity pandemic. really sure we’re talking “lying,” though government going 100% truthful everything. CDC doesn’t even know full extent getting vaccinated prevents transmission yet, wouldn’t expect recommend policy changes quite yet. reality less 20% country fully vaccinated still don’t lot data agree! Yep get that. definitely trust private companies... especially governments use app's scan logs back-door build user profile. 

That said... app open-source properly built, would trust privacy perspective. Vaccine mandates would likely lead segregation based education, class race. There’s anti vax implications that. Get weird little high horse

Of course, society little nuanced purely public health, going care. sure unlimited means according Wiki, lot guaranteed days workers UK;

mployees entitled 28 total working days (5.6 weeks) annual leave. often include 8 public/bank holidays otherwise would unpaid. Many employers offer 20 days paid annual leave addition 8 recognised bank holidays. Paid time increase years service. example, employee might accrue one extra day every 5 years service maximum 30 days paid leave, exclusive bank holidays. employers allow staff purchase sell holiday, usually maximum 5 days. Part-time workers entitled amount leave calculated pro-rata basis ya. guy said. /r/iamverysmart allow Buzzfeed here. u/brady_t12 said, indeed salty journalist, referring scientists doctors ones ""known years."" material find textbooks introductory immunology.

Science journalism improved significantly past decades, lingering problem I've noticed rather frustrating... quite often well-established science described new revolutionary discovery.

Also, clear referring experts, please remember wrote post like 1 banged like 2 minutes. Scientists bit notorious bad PR unless specifically plan it, people communicate day-to-day basis scientists, often fall trap thinking meaning clearer really laypersons (frankly, true people highly technical fields... remember dad trying teach new coding language realize he'd explain SQL was). Good think goal post keeps moving, knew start needed everyone willing get vaccinated so. Kids spread germs going school, touching things, touching face, picking nose, etc bring viruses home. Kids vaccinated go school, adding one made GLOBAL PANDEMIC seems reasonable. ad hominem attacks actually seem understand implications posted. Good job that's really sad. unfortunately also one downsides. unable scale production anywhere near BioNTech/Pfizer. Money good incentive scale up! said Americans, really meant people working American companies right?
Very rarely smartest minds American, mostly immigrants children
It’s good you’re proud Indian dude working real hard get medicine bro that's definitely norm. required law employer so. There's money 6 month protection. big pharma works together try one eachother, 'they'll gravey train life! sound nice?' /s

The way get 1 year plus advancements sell market 6month dose variant. seeing similar studies results Moderna vaccine? need go annoyance finding another appointments 6 months?? live NJ see brief statewide lockdown reopening line last year things don’t improve middle month. I’m telling stop giving people false sense doom gloom based information may may true, current evidence points untrue experience claim also says earth flat 😎 way prevent happening shut non essential domestic international air travel.  Go away fake information spreader.  You’re purposely obtuse Big Tech banning ideas oppose. You’re going flippant information agree censored. think get budge line ahead them?

Why think budge ahead line Europeans? is. work actually anything. expanded measures working urban centres rest province. 
Now timed money making ongoing vaccine.

Sounds like goal constantly vaccs needle arm keep alive along needle bank account drawing money pay vaccs. How’s sunlight vitamin treating Brazilian friends. hope so. i'm optimistic last unless new strain showed required booster. cases spiking areas compared places like Michigan hasn’t removed masks opened mu Tx FL? Essentially, hospital system collapse means hospitals overwhelmed run manpower resources treat patients. Even triaging — treating critical turning away everyone else, diverting hospitals — becomes nearly (if outright) impossible. 

Supplies like oxygen essential medicines run entire wards may die. Hospitals may close doors they’re unable treat patients. 

It’s serious even “near” “at” capacity. It’s catastrophic failure. There’s guarantee we’ll live see tomorrow. healthcare all? /s someone chimes tell ""fully"" vaccinated yet, still need cower fear like 85% good, 95% good finally go outside. managed win lottery get DC’s system - getting second shot tomorrow. want see people district get vaccinated we’re fairly behind. 😔 got yesterday feel kinda crappy maybe bit fever otherwise fine, two pieces advice second dose someone group getting vacinated drive home, try tense getting injected. second dose much rougher ride first Thank posting this. come sub. can't searches going virus whole world. That's good US, meanwhile Moderna missing shipments elsewhere, sign. family medicine MD able order 20 vaccines J&amp;J, pretty neat considering want get vaccinated strangers can't make centre. Good He’s saying along. 

There’s still lot scientists think covid could eliminated time too. I’d quite like aim seems rather defeatist stop then. [At one point strategy vaccinate less half population. Things change.] Sorry loss. :( scheduled appointment April 7. Live Michigan Studies shown immunity MERS SARS seems last many years. COVID fairly closely related two diseases - hopefully we'll see COVID immunity also lasts 10+ years. ...for saying story undersells well-founded idea science thus weakly establishes public trust phenomenon? assessment wrong

It's Pfizer's assessment serious. want know highest risk common source spread is, people's homes. Really, jails nursing homes worse, I'm assuming problem people. Homes people take precautions. industrial ventilation. rules. Everyone assumes safe precautions all. People live 80+ years. 6 month sample sufficient demonstrating issues? DTP took years get taken market Gardasil still available USA today. think people jumping head first experiment relatively low risk disease crazy. worry it, appointment fine Yep. governor state São Paulo went Bolsonaro's authority made deal China. state institution helped human tests locally packing vaccines locally Chinese supplies, vaccine right now.

Bolsonaro actually health ministry confiscate vaccines tried make look like along fooled loyal stupid followers. São Paulo's governor first tried stop doses meant everyone state vaccinated April, law allowed health minister that, would probably worse vaccination started whole country. know Man, seems like chile something strange numbers, like would count deaths ""cured/no longer infected"" boost numbers got caught president apoligze healt minister fired.

How vaccinate many worst Situation day, Trust numbers.   Brazilian here. city one best public health systems country, terms quality capacity (proportional population). refusing ICU patients almost two weeks pretty much died to.

I leave imagination average public hospital looks like right now... doesn’t matter it’s one person. You’re telling you’re okay blanket refusal compensation legitimate reason exists? Nope. thing happened sister flipping out, matter though Yes 110M coming Q3 quick easy vaccinate yet vaccinated then. 

Norway example planning vaccinate general (45-) population two steps: give people first dose two dose regimen June, second dose July, giving people one dose J&amp;J June July, effectively ending vaccination program July. deliveries J&amp;J June July enough vaccinate third Norwegian population. Keep submissions topic. add, excess death occurs almost lock step covid hitting country. little lockdowns. Testing right contact meaningless. Might well get tested, reason Well, quotes president vaccination commission. literally said scientific data mixing vaccines humans, animal research data. course likely going fine, AZ vaccine proven massive human trials, nothing indicates second vaccination would put risk. find highly dubious they'd vaccinate 2.2 million people basis positive looking animal research data. days symptoms mild all. bed, ill.

I wonder severity level would considered medical professional. knowing people play symptoms quite bit. going hospital already indicates ""very ill."" That's range natural immunity, know getting that. Natural immunity lasted long we've able measure thus far. NH Governor now:
""Once everyone state ability access vaccine, really need ever come back reinstitute restrictions again. That's really endgame getting vaccine everyone wants vaccine, well way achieving matter weeks."" Lower winter case surge? Sure. However, could easily second highest peak four. That's we're starting much higher level. Summer peaked around 70K, we're already 65K. course infections vastly underdiagnosed last spring, talking confirmed ""cases"" only, peak last spring (what might want compare since also spring) lower current rate.

Hopefully deadly last spring's peak since many vulnerable populations protected. course that's balanced deadly variants we'll see. acceptance rate online education

That's extremely concerning... Right. bottom line careful word things public.

""6 months?? That's nothing, I'm gonna risk getting art-ism this!""

""They said it'd least last 3 years muh buddy died got year after. 5G probubly made wurse."" scheduled second dose Moderna way 40 days past first shot. local clinic wonder go back see earlier second dose appointment. really know happened sub. guy obviously pulled 50% number ass top comment. Look, CEO Pfizer already said believes Covid shots may need annual event.

So guys talking one done maybe booster shot that's it?

I'm one pulling poorly sourced opinions rear receiving COVID vaccine year may offer kind protection needed one go, according Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, says shots may need become annual event. not, no. According NY Times contaminated doses delivered state doses states expect receive next week. friend's girlfriend got contact someone tested positive. Although girlfriend tested negative yesterday, got test day contact Tuesday. friend last saw Wednesday morning today hang car half hour. windows open time wore masks although sometimes took (I never took mine off). What's likelihood got covid? worried? Failures swiss cheese going guess connection impossible rather soon Yeah, we're switching dentists apparently current one staff wear masks all...

I looked around dentist right street current one got rid waiting room everyone wait cars, serious regular covid precautions. We're happily going see future.

If dentist care covid, else caring may affect health? Yikes. Can't tell sarcasm serious. true, virus care eat Olive Garden visit stores. prefers family gatherings. California passed law allows take 80 hours sick time that’s related getting vaccine you’re experiencing side effects. also retro active Jan 1st 2021. won’t. six months data it’s six months. Efficacy still 90%. better headline would “After six months vaccine still works great! We’ll let know time see drops. Carry on!” great way ensure pharma companies including smaller ones like Moderna Biontech stop taking risks years work intellectual property undone government ""the greater good."" I'm union worker, monsters employers. said serious side effects first shot cry anyway again. know it! work 2pm root canal hostility faced first half procedure weeks before. time, mean suffer taking it. seems range natural immunity original lower-end estimates. looks like easily surpass though. 2-5 years seems unlikely though due mutations. multi billion dollar question whether covid mutate year much new shot needed annually. really hope not, suppose adding flu vaccine annual tolerable. **Will J&amp;J supply issue affect vaccine appointment next week?**

I appointment clinic April 8 CT supposed administering J&amp;J vaccine. worried could affect it? confirmed Tuesday would J&amp;J.

I know mix-up supposed affect doses already distributed appointment April 8th mean vaccine already supply chain? Number people extreme allergies pretty small group. Sure wanna lean that?

Choices consequence free. nothing positive it. rising drastically instances, going downturn overnight. Stop, stop. People probably saying thing 1918 spanish flu. ""get used"" living spanish flu? case, flu died time. vaccine (my understanding). Yeah understand. You’re making completely baseless claims. Get fucked. projected 55m doses end June would enough fully vaccinate 12,29% EU's population, 15,6% adult population. that's great news. Even Canada much better... know friends who've four wisdom teeth they've go back work day. agree. EU drop AZ. continue reliable companies. I’d naively assume two doses different vaccines safe take, two kinds vaccines don’t react negative way. least protect person somewhat covid. good two doses vaccine. Two doses different vaccines better getting vaccinated all. thing would worry different vaccines causing bad reaction. again, scientist, know likely hood happening, it’s even considered. Hopefully trials successful finally beat pandemic! main concern poorer countries. everyone US vaccinated variants arise Brazil example, could possibly end back square one. pessimistic mindset, prefer think realist. hypothesizing 6-8 months? That's super low. estimates I've seen 2-5 year range. fine. probably immunize larger share population cause deaths. originally discouraged masks general public, would unable protect doctors nurses N95s entire medical system would threatened.

Since (the CDC/US government) screwed emergency supplies things bought hospitals long? Like 2 weeks so? re-using old PPE CDC telling ""safe"".

How much better would people told wear cloth masks right there? even people panicked bought supply masks......it would barely mattered reality went down. suspect would stopped ton community spread time would much impactful. general take first available vaccine ""other one""

Agreed. going let opportunity get vaccine early slip away offered Pfizer. wish USA would get involved help Brazil.

Oh wait, did. blocking Brazil receiving Sputnik V mask mandates pointless live. People refuse wear one enforces mask wearing anymore. Stores tried to, quickly gave up. 

A woman, immunocompromised, got vaccinated week people church gave flak getting vaccinated facebook. posted it, even mentioned people agree decision trusting god. That's fucked things US. 

I see vaccination rates getting high enough attitudes like this.  think you’re fine unless start showing symptoms. That’s advice give vaccinated folks Good point, know necessarily translates ""we locked harder."" along invasive privacy policies inherently odds American culture. 

There's excuse testing disaster, though. still shitshow MONTHS started. would undoubtedly helped control little better. Make ordeal--no appointments, insurance, etc. understand capacity limited, really thrown resources like we're vaccines.

I fairly large city still difficulty getting tested travel 3 weeks straight. Appointments full within hour, every day. supply, pfizer first approved injected real world setting. J&amp;J used month. people starting preference general take first available vaccine ""other one""  everyone else, I’m one matters 

Is read article?

People dying alarming rate irresponsible stupid keep schools open. Amazingly finding 65 percent children one state antibodies. think children generally asymptomatic far greater factor transmission originally thought. literally affect Johnson &amp; Johnson doses currently delivered used nationwide. doses produced Netherlands, operations fully approved federal regulators. get vaccine? Regardless, think dad fine based age (assuming even gets it), know easy worry it’s family. news cycle doesn’t help either. gonna try one soon Agreed.  ib pleased claim 100% effective.  statistically impossible? Honestly think making 100% effective claim going open door unreasonable skepticism. cool. phenomenon explained process called “somatic hypermutation.” one reasons immune system make one quintillion distinct antibodies despite human genome 20,000 genes. months years infection, memory B cells hang lymph nodes, genes code antibodies acquire mutations. mutations result diverse array antibodies slightly different configurations. Cells make antibodies good neutralizing original virus become immune system’s main line defense. cells make antibodies slightly different shapes, ones grip invading pathogen firmly, kept around, too. another zero. That's nothing.  /s Cigarette smoke doesn’t get destroyed UV radiation. cigarette smoke smell outside actually exhaled someone. comes burning cigarette tip smoker’s clothes. Yup. lungs, organs. people USA get Pfizer vaccine?

I got Moderna vaccine able get vaccine early. co-worker told clinic extras. 

I know five people got Moderna, one got J&amp;J.

While everyone know got vaccine got Pfizer. small sample size, that's number study, guarantee Pfizer.

Imagine take 20 question test. get everything right. got 100%.

Now take 200,000 question test. smart enough get 20 questions right, unlikely get 50% even 75%. It'll pretty close 100%. However, probably get 100%. happen meet tough enough question smaller 20 question exam. currently distributed doses totally ok production facility Netherlands already approved regulators. random sample? not, ehhh.... Well figured 6-8 weeks includes window, no? states already adults (or 16+ cases) date sometime early/mid April, 6-8 weeks shoots well past that. imagine lot doses would ended Canada Mexico. really sad happened, need help too, even I'm happy United States still probably going good position.  Wow. that's cool Huh, thought NYC vaccinated 1mil people fully 2.3mil partially. expecting 4-6mil people 2 months? problem mutations continue occur unvaccinated populations. far looking like vaccines holding variants currently found.  got vaccine fuck everyone else right here. wife got first Pfizer shots, dad gets first tomorrow, mom gets second next week. Things happening far faster ever expected. Samesies.. Finally! People get nasty side effects literally vaccines, there's evidence worse AZ. sucks sister really add case use AZ - plenty people horrible reactions Pfizer Moderna too. need face fact affects women ... risk benefit young women terrible

Except *no* causal link proven yet. far complete conjecture remotely approaching settled fact. worth investigating correlation equal causation need let scientists look causing events making wild claims. wild many people reddit claim take science seriously goes completely window soon comes vaccine  cool! Thanks posting. I've bookmarked it.

I wonder real, real-time data (like stock market data) extrapolation based data released daily basis (like national debt clock thingie).

Update: seems estimation rather concrete numbers tell, I'd love corrected. looking forward full stadiums movie theatres LOL volunteered last week offered dose. I’m glad would heartbeat, certainly option site. know what's hard understand this. wow cool. Let get infected then. seen estimates months ago 2 2.5 million deaths US suggested lockdowns, masks social distancing occurred. know based time period. site city, lot shots given Army Air National Guard medics, addition nurses technicians. know they're though, I'm sure giving 100 doses day gives lots experience. end march, another contender 'month's biggest fuckup' compete poor guy driving ever given Yeah covid ever saw anybody mask public looked weird, totally see benefit now.  Feels good finally say I'm one doses now. Got first dose Moderna hour ago, exciting started process much closer ending thing subscription virus Swedes live, population density exactly US towns villages. course thousands lakes woods statistically decrease density, absolutely soul lives there, totally meaningless.

In earlier times enough medicine, nowadays sometimes much. big important business.

Do know mass vaccination Great Britain already caused 34 miscarriages? sad little babies even get chance experience life all. speak traumatic lifechanging sadness mothers. Especially mothers zero fear covid anyways. I’m changing shit way live life pandemic *licks motherboard* recommend data show works. dangerous. 

Now fast growing number side effects population far vaccinated AZ UK, nothing see here? get link dm’ed too? understand that. explaining people think. one them. 20 years old health issues. Walked appointment got first dose 15 minutes. God good. South Carolina btw. Day barely raise arm shoulder, feels like took punch prime mike tyson, worth conspiracy sweep things rug suggest, J&amp;J manufacturing SNAFU kept wraps, too? seems prove proper safeguards place information freely shared public.

I guess I'm curious expertise ""cautious vaxxers"" world's leading experts pored scientific data, we've seen evidence widespread harm vaccines date. plenty evidence harmful covid thus far. Report Michigan variants Outbreak.Info data loading right minute reason check later work try  monke I'm sure asking explain people's voting / commenting behavior. Obviously idea do.

I do, however, stand statement that, date, scientific evidence annual booster shoot necessary.  Love seeing post every day. data shows that, board you. Right now, data doesn’t say that. It’s developing scenario :) Access weird word medical community. think means one thing, means another. often means theoretically possible, even real barriers sizable portions population. kind weird insurance uses tell everyone access: kids, instance. everyone needs restrict life people might lie? complete bullshit leave many long-term health issues, young people included.  Well prevents lethal cases 100%. prevents corona 76%. I'm really glad got chance get vaccine like corona gets me. Giving third shot vector sounds like good idea. I'm nurse sometimes wear mask one's around simply forgot still wearing it.

My lungs bitchmade mask doesnt affect me. Whether like not, vaccine rollout increasing every day. Deaths falling incredibly fast past month country. Again, read wrote. serious case caution - scenario vaccines fail variant and/or efficacies wear time, serious problem. We’ve lucked rapid development (fastest ever vaccine programs) great rate protection, real concerns need prepare society for. response shows much. still AstraZeneca saint company xD sloppy trials, cherry picked data on, covid plenty controversies lawsuits settle simply company anyone trust shame oxford went instead company Recently coworker quarantine bc tested positive. She'd fully vaccinated husband caught Covid unvaccinated got tested well. mean carried virus able spread become actively ill? legit test positive result. Ask ye shall Oh cool! would good way get people get flu shots lol ""The bill allows potentially hundreds workers claim benefits previously denied difficulty proving worker infected COVID-19.

If, however, employer offered vaccine worker refused, presumption apply. bill contains exception people medical condition puts risk vaccine.""

There's medical waiver bill. also allows people got sick vaccination available collect benefits. people get benefits refuse going forward without medical exemption. Bring X axis back 45 days looks whole lot less scary. fact get downvoted proves fact obnoxious shit is

It's funny. elitist armchair ""broker"" trying act cool now...

Why can't appreciate fact, vaccine good? Nah, turned yet another HURRDURR GME circlejerk. least they're right see apes. CIs overlap, \[53.5, 100.0\] BNT162b2 (BioNTech) vs \[-49.9 59.8\] AZD1222 (AZ/Oxford) Current vaccinations rollout like ritch vs. poor ... showing depend support time need. :( Really? think it’s precautionary there’s reason low supplies AZ. reorganise vaccines relevant groups deem safer doubt affected long term due volumes Pfizer soon. could probably get rid AZ wouldn’t really affect biontech fabric ready flood world vac wi switch away astra. thing really travel ban. work getting vaccines there, even millions doses right minute, would months could administer enough make difference.

I like idea closing borders like that, nobody allow travel Brazil numbers control. Great. federal law, people would it. agree working people right? Sure could really treat things people get vaccinated heard immunity. Ew, wait what? wear masks Covid then? Like even worked you? stop wearing masks procedures Covid? countries, even richer ones, domestic vaccine production capabilities. Canada, example Thanks, I'll cautious get tested early next week. Literally nowhere population immunity coronavirus, we're rolling vaccines. We're boat here, let's see secure magical vaccines sitting around nothing? 

It's absolute bollocks. Spain we've like 9.6 million doses delivered (6.4m pfizer,2.1 AZ, 1.1 Moderna ), we've administered 8.3m (so 86% delivered). majority administered second shots. 

If supply we'd injecting! feels like reddit lot Brexit trolls.  Great. Let's pass federal law workers. 7 days? Luxury! dream 7. get 4.

But yeah, place sounds shittier mine. Good riddance fuckers. got az age discrimanted allowed get another vac.......

I wont take second az shot becauss yes prevents lethal cases, still consider worst garbage vaccine there. would even take sputnik 5 vac mixed chinese kitchen. lasts 6 months gotta take another one try avoid national news watch reruns Chips. Oh yeah!!! You’d mix anyway since az apparently worthless mutations, pretty interesting though simply skip meaningful trials mixing   March 7, longer collecting new data  Marty McFly would know:) happened removed comments lol?  screen COVID vaccine get plane (or grocery store), stopping screening schizophrenia mental illnesses could possibly pose threat others get plane (or grocery store)?

I’m genuinely wondering people don’t see slippery slope private health data.

I’m getting vaccine encourage others mandate everywhere I’m unsure that. Germany invested 1.5 billion Covid vaccine development. per capita basis twice US invested vaccine development. UK funded Oxford vaccine development 85 million pounds, EU paid 350 million Euros pre-finance AstraZeneca production. literally is? I’m sorry hear that! hope develop vaccine bad allergies vaccines. There’s vaccines created type, nasal sprays pill forms well. hope remain safe then! fair, really demonstrative even US employers. Many, including own, granting additional time allow employees travel receive first second doses. Likewise many friends who's companies making take sick days days missed end adverse side effects. I'm essential worker, never went anywhere except work home get medical care needed pandemic, although I'm work little surgery. plan changing I'm living I'm fully vaccinated. I'm young, I've juggling multiple health problems entire life really want add covid possible long-term effects mix. EU began process late August

Wrong alternative explanation 100 years without vaccine, people left would ones get sick. 

Look diseases Europeans mostly lived ravaged Native American societies. virus inherently less dangerous, anybody Europe going drop dead common cold already done left surviving heirs. get hangnail I'm taking PTO. I've earned days shame guilt using them. Oh boy, read comment history wowwwwww. 

That bad article link lol. know small percentage people fully vaccinated test positive Covid. best part article asymptomatic main goal vaccine. great article shared known, fantastic news. worries, probably pierced vein way in, went right through, injected muscle be. Even went vein, would ok. Moderna? really hard emigrate. I've looked extensively. issue often one cause listed, especially COVID, since existing health issues major risk factor. maybe someone chronic congestive heart failure, would almost certainly survived year normal time. get COVID, turns serious, pass away. Death certificate likely reads COVID combination CHF. get sucked debates assholes actually indicates overcount, die COVID, died *with* COVID. that's assuming actual death certificates accurately marked, especially people may passed away home without direct medical care. Especially earlier phase, going use scarce testing resources people already passed. Absent specific plausible scenario completely independent non-COVID cause led spike deaths *also* happens track lockstep overall COVID cases, excess deaths best way determine likely range current undercounts. they're closer equator summer time mean spending much time sun. Without concerted movement get outside, bet they're still home-bound office-bound like rest us. need new employer. girlfriend works Apple, gets paid get vaccine gets paid stay home days second shot doesn’t feel well. right, better 10 people vaccinated MRNA 10 people MRNA 10 people AZ. seriously get people board here. Goalposts need stop moving. close accomplishing initial goals lockdown. Time start returning normal. I'm running patience restrictions I've board since day 1. Mostly mental health beyond awful right now. Theyre going buddy. Look  Strangely Africa many deaths.

But maybe people young there. looks like small national increase California done exceptional job. 

Look individual states, like Michigan, North Carolina, Mass, yes, even Florida. Ever thought finding new civilized country? lucky. got letter doctor saying I’m eligible current vaccines due severe allergic reactions I’ve past. Gonna remain house get groceries delivered another years, guess. Covid hospitalizations deaths plumetting.

Nationwide looks case California.

But start looking individual states, like Michigan Mass, hospitalizations RISING...two weeks cases started rising, cue. Hell yeah!!! MD, keep taking expected BA... good fucking grief P.1 would like word .... submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understanding concerns. flu shot caused instances Guillian Barre go slightly. vaccine same? Could cause 2nd round Guillian Barre people who've it? Guess what, nobody knows I've already one doctor advise getting vaccine. Edit: I've covid, taste symptom. Cause closing Brazil like closing USA China/3  top that, we've told spread driven private gatherings 15-20 people. Families friends getting together unique urban rural areas.

True.  real estate prices give away. mass Flott! Takk så mye! So, agrees EU stop exports use vaccines home? arrangements? It’s reason family living paranoid hermit lifestyle year now. It’s lonely sitting curbside pickup parking spots rest humanity streams store.

Just weeks go now. gonna mess close finish line. EU trying hard. That's enough, shouldve anticipated prepared like rational government wouldve done know last week though. really communicate numbers knowledge, maybe outrageous ones. looks like they're getting rid stockpile next weeks though. Getting first update tomorrow! may bad news you... literally typed out. that's weird. Good news then, they're already working that. Scheduled mine next Monday VA. Fingers crossed avoid surge CDC keeps warning ICU capacity increase last 12 months hospital? citizens countries outside US even first vaccine US would buy everyone second vaccines, would last 6 months. got firmware update microchip! mean companies received massive government funding? major vaccine funded government? Chances low covid. 

Follow CDC guidelines. there’s enough exposure someone who’s infected, quarantine quarantine 7 days get tested @ 5th day. lot good evidence, thing want believe framing statistics tearful media anecdotes reinforce that. People immunocompromised getting reinfected serious numbers like people symptomatic perpetuating ""pandemic"" This. I’m losing sleep “at least”. not. links provided country whole. 

There nothing exponential vaccine rollout although vaccinations increasing steadily. Biontech said could adjust vaccine within 6 weeks new variants. really powerful tool. lemme guess ill likely result bankrupting hospital bill either? think you’re right!  course forced. Read article. see calendar. Note give second dose anyone mid June, time expect everyone offered vaccination. means July give J&amp;J first dose. First all, you’re simply carrying iPhone, Apple provider know everywhere go when. Google - even know fetishes!

If you’re worried simply keep picture QR code photos show that, carry paper copy. ""pre-existing"" phase, there's really way check someone smokes not. Michigan decided open vaccines everyone think this. easy lie, restriction letting liars cut front non-liars, Governor said vaccinate anyone 16+ wants it. guy represents first chart incorrectly, 7 day moving average cases 17% week. 14.9% last 2 weeks, 11.1% last 2 weeks exclude Michigan’s massive jump cases. Premature call wave entire country, seen Israel happened vaccinated 50% adult population (we 1/3rd, 1.5M 1st shots per day would obtain 50% mid April 50% immunity vaccination early May). doesn’t look like enough runway get control vast majority country hit milestone. got first shot well today! county opened open adults vaccination site packed Terribly sorry that. We'll magic couple hundred million doses vaccine existence thin air get it. Interesting. 
Those words emotional weighting them. 
An outcome usually positive. 
A consequence usually negative. 

It's wrong use term outcome closer neutral weighting, probably better comparing outcomes. outcome really bad consequence stronger word. FLU! /s I’m guessing they’ll mostly vaccinated soon, I’m expecting many postponements first month-ish. Since vaccines smaller immune load natural infection, less chance antibodies cross reacting nervous system (which causes GB) vaccines covid influenza. everyone gets vaccinated covid influenza, risk GB actually goes DOWN. /shrugs Eh, would actually bet different given many pharmacies cities. think 3 walgreens within 2 blocks Chicago. 

On top that, we've told spread driven private gatherings 15-20 people. Families friends getting together unique urban rural areas.  ""small number people"" part infuriates covid already affects small number people significant way talking age group.

This relative danger. reason nations started prohibiting based numbers found. Got first dose today. Couldn’t happier. Next one 22nd Same. second Pfizer shot felt exactly like first, extremely minor arm pain tried lift arm head absolutely it. Almost everyone know got Pfizer vaccine mild symptoms. think adjuvant Moderna that's causing side effects. That’s one way guess. meant emotionally, whatever floats boat. Can’t bothered reply someone POV. like turtles 😐 reason see articles like everyday updated research/results pfizer vaccine moderna? results effectively extrapolated vaccines? MS. Even urban centers fairly flat since Feb. could know long lasts wait long enough see? 5 years said ""at least 5 years"" would keep waiting still know long lasts? GET ANTI VAXXER. LISTEN SCIENCE. work I’m public wear n95 masks.

I recommend wearing clothes Roma woman sterilized unknown circumstances 20 years ago absolutely relevance topic lol neighbor got 2 x Pfizer shots January, last weekend got Covid anyway roommate kind like too. Really proud fact NEVER calls out, even sick. Like congrats someone spreads viruses everyone else, guess? ""Perfect attendance"" awards school really fucked society up. Lmao nursing school classmates refuse get vaccinated, citing “big bad Government”. Really makes sad patients going care lot people going really messed long time thanks varying sources fear-mongering. Honestly saying *probably* true, error bars epistemological uncertainty early studies efficacy one dose 1.5 weeks 10 days first dose getting second dose large would still recommend people wait week second shot thinking well-protected. like two actual real world efficacy/effectiveness studies Pfizer's one-dose efficacy, one says 50% two weeks says 80%, part reason diverge much probably genuinely hard design unbiased study collect large enough sample size get precise efficacy number, although encouraging studies studies indicators immune response seem pointing direction. personally take time like job gets done poorly people suffer there. Suffer might strong word, get idea.

It unavoidable unless really good preparation work get sick. Okay I'll bite: ""They made informed choice accepted risk. purposefully unvaccinated people free get virus deal it. get immunity anyway, problem solves itself.""

You try mask stance behind half-clever rationalizations, working well. think could really useful children can't get vaxxed yet age limitations. could make opening schools much safer. ‘Murcia! Colorado do, sure they’re talking exactly. Kids get like two three vaccines/titers visit they’re young thinking become less deadly time? think PHO's need come provide finishing line target control peoples behaviour, goal post moving likely people say meh recently COVID. Starting Friday, eligible get vaccine.

His doctor said unsafe get vaccine within 2 months infection bad many anitbodies?

Is true? I've tried googling around can't find anything. think pretty clear comment implied reason nurses doctors enough intelligence. fair, EU really shot foot sidelining AZ-Oxford vaccine fears blood clotting. cheapest readily available version Europe. ought revisit decision based fact multiple agencies said cases likely linked vaccine. Holding millions doses something statistically small. results half sub freaking high case numbers half telling fine. read Pfizer proven effective SA variant, Moderna well then? got Moderna,y state SA variant one main ones, extra cautious see family friends til SA booster? really wanted celebrate baby's first birthday family never even met him. They're vaccinated too. show *Cells Work* really shows well, think. Neutrophils, T-cells, NK cells boots ground, macrophages arriving clean duty occasionally help out. cells acting coordinators command center. got accurate information suggests vaccine doesn’t prevent long term effects?

I’ve got data shows long term effects haven’t shown themselves, people suffering long covid getting better vaccine stop blaming everyone else it’s EUs fault taking long put orders vaccines. would funny global solution. American visiting Brazil? Ireland you. Yep, Ontario boat Huh? thought supposed lifetime like vaccines. Well said, thank you. That’s value accurate information value freedom. Freedom bad thing. value both. 20ish made decision spend time working spend myself. Seemed reasonable get live half life. 

It huge change one family friends support of. 

Now mid 30's, I'm self employed work Mondays, Wednesdays Thursdays. 3 days per week. use time days strategic planning organization productive working hours. know I'm missing sales opportunities days time worth much $$'s. 62 years old seems real old you. still working 5 days week. much social security ""golden years"". still can't believe gone. Oh thank god I’m at, hard pass break leg tho. Yeah first shot problem second one five days. GF got back normal like 24 hours. think it’s third entire country batshit insane, people end place Yes don’t value actual data Twitter. Delete account, delete app, pay mind Im glad work union... Im getting paid extra 2 hours per shot even day off....  America one worst first world countries majority citizens. I’m glad live one progressive states. course, means real estate crazy expensive property taxes roof. There’s emerging issue NPs, too. go school get BSN immediately become NP without ever seeing like week bedside care. course I’m saying aren’t amazing NPs there, nursing profession suffering laughable shit. 

That said, PGY-1 doctorate degree don’t really know anything, either. Basically medicine bunch new people walking around fancy degrees can’t even hang IV remember take manual blood pressure, lol. hey, there’s never dull moment here! 🤪 basically war.

Not yet. Pro-diseases (anti-vaxxer) still exist... mention vaccinated secret. 14 August 2006, United Nations (UN) Committee Elimination Discrimination Women (CEDAW) found state Hungary violated Convention Elimination Forms Discrimination Women (the Convention) ensuring Roma woman (A. S.) sterilized January 2001 given fully informed consent sterilization (UN 29 Aug. 2006, 17). Hungary signatory Convention ratified 22 December 1980 (ibid. 12 Oct. 2011).


This fairly widespread, one off. occurrences http://www.errc.org/press-releases/united-nations-hungary-coercively-sterilised-romani-woman


Many Roma discriminated seek employment, government rate problem. agree. Let’s flu ^/s think understand margin error means And? u sick come back Ur also takes time actually study process publish data HSE says rules apply students except ""very exceptional circumstances specific documented medical contraindication vaccination healthcare student."" said international travel okay, need passport already countries require updated vaccines. able walk target go restaurant area whole different thing. slippery slope step never it. go towards what's next? patriot act stuff taken away 20 years nearly.  governments get power never get back. thrown out. Completely safe. get J&amp;J upcoming weeks even produced facility. know nurses even wear mask properly wear mask one around. Right. 

But would many deaths happen vaccine? 

There seems disconnect here. Could cases increase? Yes. Could Texas see actual wave mass deaths? science vaccines correct. quotes OP. sure got impression time situation explaining matches based comments. I'm sitting ass seven days neglecting job common flu. take couple days worst man get back it, pass. sounds like big baby must important job take unplanned week off. GL chief. safe. contaminated vials there. doses currently scheduled next week different plant Netherlands. children's arms ready poke day vaccine available them. Yeah, make claim vaccine protection longevity time duration data. Claiming longer duration without data support kind like tech world someone writes job postings require three years experience programming language existed six months. That's true today. Maybe month so. I'm definitely group, got first dose monday. know others higher risk think are, seeking it, able get 1-2 weeks.

I think statement true soon, true today. Yeah man, think thought ""xbox on""! need vaccine passports live similar way flu? get 7 months data. 8 months data. on. I’m trying think nice way suggest stop freaking out. 

This good news. There’s suggestion protection drop dramatically next month two. don’t know yet, it’s unlikely. 

It’s also unlikely we’ll need 2 dose booster. booster shot likely one dose. 

Your “at worst, needing booster annually” kind says something you. meant say “at best.” There’s part subconscious that’s rooting reveling bad news. That’s way someone could twist report badly. 

And no, best may need booster several years maybe ever. check local subreddit able give tips websites dump appointments etc. also willing drive hour really helped find one since live high demand area. good attitude though, every person gets vaccinated good thing us! actually seriously trying make point? 

It duty American serve jury go jury duty. back bone judicial system United States. hill would ""dying"" one important institutions history man. 

Standing rights get black listed. explicitly says review got trouble going jury duty would win major court case. sorry reddit friend. helps, America evil year excess deaths many years troubled politics. good news been: women's soccer championship; Mars rover; bit ahead Europe vaccinations. Numbers lie . . . Germany 6 weeks behind America that's it. Germany absolutely catch-up understand frustration. hope America starts exporting weeks relieves pressure EU. Hopefully get long term data mRNA vaccines children help allay fears folks like you, completely valid. New tech always little scary risky. anaphylactic reaction totally different situation refusing covid vaccine due allergy refuse wear mask days act irresponsibility. NOWHERE story mentioned allergy. 

One choice, one don't. Allergy PEG incredibly rare. ""Immediate-type life-threatening reactions vaccines exceedingly rare; reported occur 1.3 cases per million doses."" 

If student nurse allergy, nurse might case. How? working home since beginning pandemic. see anyone aside spouse. canceled every vacation planned. restaurants bars. 

Not say go office expose anyone. jackass' narrative created. point think absurd take entire week work something like common flu ability work safely. seems soft shit Thanks much this. One effective responses anti-vaccine sentiment hitting people hurts most: wallet. explain means layman's POV? make Moderna less effective long term? guys....when say ""at least 6 months), they're talking long since started administering it. time passes, ""months"" added. headline put back, 3 4 5 months instead that's time passed. safe get J&amp;J vaccine? possibility get contaminated vial?

Haha knew idiot would downvote perfectly valid question. still tested positive get vaccinated. case would told self-isolate. hope guy doesnt get another shot, available country. sitting around nothing 

I dunno finding vaccines. country use everything comes delivery reserve best 10% second shots. Wait what? 6 months???? Sigh. Exactly. Admins deleted posts prepare delete. I’m baffled controversial Actually, pretty promising. Three main ones development zika, rabies, influenza. main difference wasn’t sense urgency development like Covid. Zika contained pretty well already effective rabies vaccines market. Influenza already difficult thing vaccinate against, it’s basically always guessing game. mRNA vaccine technology incredibly promising, especially looking future. Emergency Use Authorization admittedly relatively new concept FDA, given before, scale Covid vaccine. H1N1, Tamiflu given EUA infants even though hadn’t studied well. Good point. thinking distance. Like remove territories continuing delivery concern vax push. U!!! guarantee you’ll feel like hot garbage! people know got Moderna, reported intense side effects. 

How feeling far? got Pfizer week ago. felt ok first day downhill second day. haha upside, it’s Thursday true weekend maybe worst hit sleep. 

Also injections burn like hell? I’ve never experienced anything like shot. country nurses working?

(happy cake day!) local regulations obeying? Haha “we’ve heard before”

That said it’s terrible idea... buzzfeed article... BANNED! Pharma companies providing information studies published journals well briefing documents send regulatory agencies like FDA applying authorization, find FDA web site. memory, small differences efficacy different demographics prior health conditions. one major exception people immune disorders - e.g., Novavax nearly efficacious HIV-positive patients South Africa trial. can’t get appointment. I’ve checking every day since group opened everything booked up. 

Normally, would irritated, I’m really happy people actually taking damn thing. Vaccine efficacy 100% - always small risk. luck. honestly.

you train body fight infection whatever reason body might weak day, antibodies can't enough, etc... human body incredibly complex nothing 100%

and reasons 5% variants/strains not, still unknown. would overflow deaths require conspiracy level coverup? hyperbole day I’m caught up? mass gathering could lead mass deaths, take body burning comment. Akin mass graves refrigerated corpse trucks happened result bodies piling up. like shot! like shot! Yeah, love phrasing. Props redditor J&amp;J.. Unless immigrant, Denmark screws hard. see Wrigley field crowded TORTOISE! really understand got impression. said basically unable take day two off.

Didn't mention finances, likely due boss disapproves sick days.

Different cause, result, employees showing sick. wanted point another reason ton people show sick. say shitty thing do, correct, putting blame employees rather employers.

Have come sick get ton trouble boss otherwise, literally can't afford it? shitty person. like thinking. Yes, awful, agree puts everyone else risk, like anyone ever wants come sick. do, due work environment financial situation. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Got vaccines? No? really, really quiet. Agreed. end feeling crummy days recover normally, that's fine. Hopefully 9% group first place, even am, Covid longer scary was. Crap. got second Pfizer morning. Yeah. reasons. One old managers told managers searched anything able fire me. gotten rid rest bilingual team pay level me. new hires came much lower pay scale me. According her, reviewed normal 5 calls month order catch infraction. 

Funny thing, quit next month. managers department head either transferred fired. one original worker there. Unfortunately really toxic workplaces America. Yeah, read headline instantly thought, wtf?! 6 months?! use pandemic lasted almost 18 months? People still get antibody tests done month final dose, make sure arent one small percentage people dont gain immunity. Pfizer's vax doesnt work 5% people, wouldnt put number unless concise, headline kind needs asterisk. edit: Fuck it. clearly pulling ""They protect deserve vaccines DO"" card.  There's discussion around bullshit. Well that's even better! Hopefully US government massive advertising campaign promoting vaccine Right, talked last paragraph. That’s indirect death due pandemic. unfortunate suffer due AZ. Masks 100% effectives preventing infections means would still get train immune system. Also, mask 100% effectives preventing infections, need immune system anyway. Hell, thrilled get 95% grueling 4 hour 200 question test certification. test *hard* I'd studied ass paid nearly $500 take it, fucking ecstatic 95%. one know random sample population anymore?

You can't take convenience sample apply statistics assume random sample expect get right numbers 0.1% accuracy. stats 101. still need wear mask times, unfortunately. think that’s main gripe people come “just schedule around work” attitude. get get. It’s difficult making appointments. don’t really luxury choosy vaccine brand accept days schedule. guess waited indefinitely? maybe states better/more efficient, jeez. 

Also, everyone “weekends” people speak lol Fair enough. effects different everyone. guess I’ll keep posted want tomorrow 😅 freedoms limited? sounds like melodramatic hyperbole. know, flights require it, would alternative means transportation. lose ""freedom movement"". feel bad minimum wage store workers going deal you. Target worker tying job know you’re vaccinated? take word it? People lie. Nope, FDA updated rules late There's good programs. There's quick programs focus much science background side. I'm health attended school one top top nursing programs US.

You run 12s get run ragged whole week off. people like that. Yes, trade offs.I'm saying could attractive job.

If nurse gone bsn higher, know people called nurses league.  amazing mods removed comment nothing quote article. guess reality political sub. 30% vaccinated, considering something like 95+% deaths 65+, 75% 65+ least received dose means regardless wave, largest impact covid (death hospitalization) minimized. hate made laugh Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* \*\*If afford that. problem many. sure VAERS website open standby make sure something bad happens gets recorded. Haha, going sugar coat yeah suck. But, it’s way better alternative it’s less one day flu immunity serious covid think fair trade. left job. work hospital get paid days exposed side effects vaccine. get paid decent health benefits amazing. I'm pretty healthy take care myself. Since Covid, I've thanked lucky stars I've consistently employed first get vaccinated. walk appointments usually larger line see hesitation well... agree. think need J&amp;J clinics underserved neighborhoods myself. think single mom 2 kids car find time two shots? think again. (and blame anyone situation one bit - need reach them) use semicolon instead comma intention. - used appointments dog's vet appointments. year, earn less 10 days per year went ""earned PTO formula"". math, way earn 80 hours ""earning"" take time paid holiday (we get 4 - 7/4, Thanksgiving, Christmas NY Day). US also waste time cheap Pfizer negotiated good purchasing agreements took care citizens. implying EU completely screw vaccine purchasing agreements? pneumonia lingered 6-8 months...well aware unfortunately haha DON'T. care do. probably wear one now, you?!

What's hard difficult wearing mask?! I've nudist 40 years, hate clothes, go wear them. Wearing mask comfortable wearing clothes. Wow, tests completely at-home give results within 15 minutes. 

Swab nose, add solution card, insert swab wait. 

The BinaxNow Quickvue at-home tests expected sold 2- packs around $15-20. Yeah, know what... beginning pandemic thinking herd protection.

Now, seeing people around wear masks law forces to, coworkers defended offline teaching totally unnecessary, made fun insisting opening windows, every business owner claims business totally safe allowed open clearly isn't, people flock bar interiors soon they're allowed, building people remove mask upon entering ride elevator maskless, etc... care less community honest. care loved ones, others fend far I'm concerned felt zero support community, neighbors coworkers pandemic.

An babies clearly dying COVID significant rate, know much many get long COVID. I'd rather catch all. Yeah, last administration. could say ""the vaccine works entire duration period studied"" true. 6 months comes from. right, people hear 6 months assume means immunity end that, evidence. Yeah, that's true.

Still, pneumonia, even survive thanks miracles modern medicine, walk park.

1) Get shots

2) Wait 2 weeks

3) ????

4) Profit! get sick unlimited days get paid them! USA USA USA Exactly! I'm pharmacist works side large health system one earliest COVID vaccine doses given. I'm intimately familiar aspects vaccine process health organization perspective. LOL lot comments here. lot presented conviction believed true fact base. recognize expert particular field.

However, many things I'm expert honestly makes question everything read Reddit. Detroit public schools learn virtually one week following return spring break, officials Thursday.  Detroit Public School Community District, students staff commence virtual learning April 5-9 “as safety precaution,” COVID-19 cases surge Michigan Metro Detroit.  say temporary switch online learning designed “allow employees students week social isolation spring break limit spread COVID-19,” [**announcement  say in-person learning resume April 12, learning centers reopen then. School staff required receive negative COVID test returning buildings resuming in-person learning. wrong. 

It's blood clots general CVT, specific ans serious type blood clot caused AZ much higher rate occurs population large. Yeah, pretty depressing giving people ability vaccinated without financial loss, midst pandemic, considered liberal policy, that's America live in! Remember “hospitals overwhelmed”? 
Covid less threat kids 16 flu that’s fact. suggestions continued lockdowns/masks protect kids insanity. Perfect! Thanks! I'm midst new muscle building routine that's kind bodybuilding-esque today great hear Nah, asking good faith question. Bye, troll! show scientific studies researched please? would like see ""science"". ruined, fixed? theory scientific studies rigor better guessing. words “it’s six months since trial concluded, still good.” sound like baby haha That's good question. lots people *strictly* followed mask guidelines STILL became infected. know sure people simply susceptible viruses others. clear pattern, either.

There lots people done much all. Still hanging friends, wearing mask much else sick bit.

I realize everyone wants rules. follow rules, nothing bad happens. simply work way contagious illness. guarantees. I've said 2 times already available area yet. I'm trying difficult I'm antivax. I'm trying communicate someone seems informed am. CVS offering vaccines risk individuals I'm risk. Would recommend lie potentially take vaccine someone needed do?? understand headlines like take data specific area start applying national scale. 

Michigan extreme outlier. cases rising elsewhere US too, nothing close MI. Everywhere else world we've dealing outlier areas tightening restrictions there's cause concern elsewhere. see evidence going problem rest US? Right evidence exist. postulating theorizing.

I get travel happens fuel surge everywhere, like every Michigander loading car take road trip today. Eventually true. anti vaxxed get covid, die get immunity hard way. I'm guessing interval (or even anything close it) studied all. Single-dose, think, was, going worse that. trolling, even little. 

It article Scientific American. pushed Reddit.

We discussing industry journal, scientific one. magazine general scientific interest standard consumer audience. 

Again, read magazine, I'm expert field. Hell, point career, doubt I'm expert much anything (maybe wife something).

I appreciate trying say, really need go back read original post. go back source cited. I'm sorry, poster arrogant, quite negative reason all. 

Mind you, think see respectful generally positive, think trying put shine something simply never shiny. (my god horrible metaphor, sorry). personal reasons? wife gotten yet trying conceive already trouble, doctors said hold studies done. valid reason selfish? Hey insult Florida way - fine here. 14 days since 1st shot Pfizer, 4 days late period (negative pregnancy test). I’m worried, know fairly common periods get irregular body stress/battling illness (which vaccine tricks thinking). Would rather take chance vaccine covid. got first dose yesterday 10am intense workout noon felt nothing.  Israel reported 176 cases 5 deaths. Looking forward seeing numbers nosedive weeks months ahead. CDC director made statement Rachel Maddow Show week. topic. long enough. data aware that's related recently discharged population risk complications. It’s time *you*, people vulnerable likely infect someone vulnerable. rabies fucked with. 

whenever exposed even think exposed, get vaccinated. rabies horrible way die, guaranteed death sentance. one two examples people surviving post-onset symptoms, serious medical intervention.

seriously, ever even suspect might exposed rabies, get vaccinated asap. time start exibit symptoms, late, fucked. bet every one sells essential oil and/or supplement, too. six month booster, look efficacy 6 months 90% going magically drop 0% even 50% six months + one day.

The fact efficacy remains high within confidence interval published originally two months post vaccination strongly suggests protection likely persist years. thing really consider potential future variants ""escaping"" vaccine level escape. Oh fuck's sake...  I've read they're starting think older adults may need MMR booster, too. Well, think they’re saying you’re idiot knowing stuff already, you’re wrong. They’re talking way information presented. onus isn’t know things already, it’s author article make clear aren’t new facts, things known YEARS. don’t take response arrogance, take frustration media properly explaining understanding situation experts have. new us aren’t medical field, experts known things decades articles explaining information general public aren’t experts shouldn’t presenting new found information. That's blows mind. Last year EU looking us well, reversed! one wants speak soon. They're conservative Yeah, criticise others? They're ***checks notes*** independent body made World's leading Doctors specialising virology, epidemiology medical logistics. fellow medical scientist also learned concept Immunology years ago, need recognize *you* might contributing blind spot science communicators general public. take issue quoted section article replied to, serves catch people highly specific concept somatic hyper mutation. defines discusses greater context SARS-CoV-2. What's issue?

For vast majority public, science information ingested timeline I, literally took classes structured order subject, received information. Laypeople take non-linear approach learning niche information, first enticed headline getting ""caught up"" established science inside.

I'm sure mean best, careful riding line gatekeeper science communicator, see anything clickbait-y article headline quoted excerpt. they've eligible jump mean they've opportunity. age, they're likely limited transportation tech get online get booked. tl;dr:

It likely antibodies remain protective levels years patients. However, anticipate point booster shot necessary maintain appropriate antibody titers. less. 

it's possible variant could mutate way totally evade current antibodies generated vaccine, never totally binary, on/off sort situation. much likely strain mutate resistance, complete evasion. end result vaccine/antibodies less effective overall, could catch mutant strain, chances severe almost negligable. less backed preliminary research.

Hmmm, maybe missing unique feature exclusive virology. usually care people telling ""edumacate myself,"" seems like pulling depth knowledge currently have. still believe multi-mutation thing anything new, I'll look funsies. immune system changes response exposure new antigen (either infection vaccination). 

Well... kind true kind not. body still develop specific effective antibodies antigen exposed again. also unclear whether person responding considers covid variant's altered spike protein ""new antigen."" sense part spike protein different, whereas parts might least similar enough initiate immune response vaccinated individual.

The short though even vaccinated individual exposed covid variant, still head start mounting immune response, result much much less likely experience severe manifestation disease. extremely unlikely covid variants evade vaccinated person's immune response completely clearly don’t even work scientific medical community, did, you’d know entire field made predatory opportunism, especially US. We’re acutely aware shortcomings field, damn sure aren’t going use “predatory opportunism” reason discount vaccine we’ve literally watched *colleagues* die covid. Going comments accusing people “thinking scientists” demanding research it’s even warranted contributing nothing constructive conversation. available research isn’t obscure fantasy “scientists” privy to; it’s common fucking sense point game.

Hard work. Traditional American values working hard fading country positive, unless like communism guess. studies Pfizer's asymptomatic protection reflected real data seeing UK. Pfizer better AZ stopping transmission, doubt good studies suggest. inevitably need boosters anyway, virus mutate never get vaccine coverage required globally stop transmission. India population 1 billion, they've barely started rollout. US get anywhere near vaccination rates get, virus still spread mutate. think accept reality boosters rather aiming end variants.

If ZA variant evades protection AZ vaccine (severe illness etc), we'll slow roadmap probably implement short term New Zealand style border closure. We're tracking spread ZA variant think confident act quickly data suggests ZA variant starting grow. Currently still miniscule impact total case number. Ironically, AZ jab's inability stop transmission might silver lining, ensure UK variant continues circulate outflank new variants. 

Pfizer shown indication capabilities produce vaccine enough us rely MRNA like US. EU implement export ban, Pfizer moan take EU's money (especially given Germany biggest funder, alongside US, Biontech-Pfizer vaccine). Moderna still setting EU facility Switzerland vague rollout Europe.

Do stats indicate **most** Americans get time work Covid vaccines (or sick days general)? Quite probably less often. idea huge amount MRNA vaccines waiting come UK fanciful. 10 million doses Pfizer order, given EU's rhetoric unrealistic believe reach us smoothly next months. ordered 17m moderna indication arrive pace next months. Novavax ready May absolute earliest, possibly June given difficulties ramping production quickly. US MRNA vaccines, export ban, decision massively prioritise Canada Mexico, make unlikely UK get stocks time soon. AZ vaccine actually guarantee consistent supply of. want delay AZ doses wait MRNA, roadmap pushed back, they'll many people getting hospitalised unvaccinated groups. idea year lockdown people would regard booster jab autumn massive problem nonsense. would lose faith government would suspend AZ vaccine absolutely evidence caused ""blood clot"" cases agree dropping masks. may want look whether vaccinated people really spreading it. cdc released data suggests Pfizer moderna, 94%+ effectiveness actually means people even get virus can’t spread it. 
We really don’t know whether vaccinated people spread asymtomatically not. data seems suggest don’t. Obviously vaccinated fall smaller subset people still catch virus wouldn’t apply pass on. 
I think masking 1) know sure 2) take masks off, sets precedent even people without vaccine take masks off. want Hela’s outfit. siiiccckkk. needs disbanded everything replaced something new Testing usually recommended way possible test positive long fully recovered. I'm talking restrictions vaccinated people. talking information. Stop giving people false information. Give correct information let decide themselves. 

However, want talk restrictions reason vaxxed people need wear masks can't tell vaccinated isnt looking them. lift restrictions vaxxed people unvaxxed people lie infection spread. everyone wants chance vaccinated yet, neither kids, can't remove restrictions majority people vaxxed. know think person matters, live society try make rules based many peoples safety. yours. Think way.

I afraid covid understand risk *incredibly* low. Like I'm talking, chances dying car accident.

I afraid vaccines chances something like happening *incredibly* low. mean, 72 year old dad got shots already nothing pain injection site.

For example, one single twitter user banned recently resulting \~65% drop fake news/misinformation spread.  

Sometimes nip bullshit bud. need start exporting vaccines ASAP. Even 10% US's daily vaccine deliveries (for example) would make enormous difference Brazil set States back week two. long run better everyone, even Americans, like said vaccine resistant variant waiting emerge. I'm talking donations, just... let private companies start exporting. Congrats!

Let arm hang getting shot muscles tense, drink lots fluids stretch arm injection, take tylenol going bed. Pretending kids mostly stuck inside fear past year magically make so. Lol Europe preoccupied debating hard keep locking populations instead focusing one thing truly works.

Everyone tired moving goalposts. society can't always expected operate level safe dumbest members. New study South Africa finds Pfizer 91% effective variant. statement weren’t true, fuck would point vaccine. shit? Well , complete failure . tunnel even light end . would make skeptical? We’ve known along vaccines anywhere 75-95 percent effective. also reasons health people would higher priority Philly. example, healthcare workers, customer-facing essential jobs, critical manufacturing workers, anybody lives works congregate setting like shelter group home, pretty much anybody involved food service, even clergy eligible 1B. bs. work wardsperson got vaccinated pfaizer us still got covid. difference vaccine makes bad symptoms unvaccinated people. still get infected infect others. Waking new month month closer end nightmare feels good man. look daily numbers NYT puts out, CDC. numbers higher two weeks earlier, every day week. Today's:

Over past week, average 64,396 cases per day, increase 17 percent average two weeks earlier. Yup anyone thinks case paying attention year... trump still pull strings! cohort long-haulers large enough rigorous studies yet, anecdotal evidence showing long-haulers experiencing improvement symptoms receiving vaccine.

Which points one two directions: either vaccine mechanism alleviates least long-haul covid, least long-haul covid psychosomatic vaccine unblocking mental process people that's keeping around.

I'm happy odds. people would say fully vaccinated fully vaccinated people able resume normal lives. Yah impacting production all, adding paper deal with, worst annoying Pfizer, slowing production all. article explicitly confirms this. something else fearmonger instead. I'm arguing well informed gamble, gamble. article sent also contains passages critical three month strategy.  


I managed find Lancet article easily expected. Turns late Feb early March. see here: 


Their concern seems twofold, firstly assumption underpinning decision follow 3 month strategy based evidence. Essentially *"" However, biology straightforward vaccines . . . immune system remembers first dose respond whether later dose three weeks three months""* underpinned scientific evidence. Secondly large number people partial Pfizer protection risks emergence variants immune vaccine.  


To mind, planing vaccine strategy around assumption evidence back gamble. Even sensible one potential consequences dire.  


In response edit, UK country world leading professors. (as far know) country chosen 3 month strategy Pfizer outset. doubt knowledge objectivity JVCI. That's like peeing section lazy river waterpark

That lazy river connected everything Ahh, get now: simple act shitting kid elevates it, spawn, level importance far everyone else around them!

f outta that. i'm glad love kids, that's great. nobody else cares. What's next?

Likely tears recriminations.

The conspiracy theorists never, ever let go one. China never admit anything, even unlikely possibility shred truth it.

Either way, virus there, going go away. Deal it. Fauci (followed media) blasted Rand Paul week ago saying case... Well... quick google search america 30.5 million cases 552,000 deaths. thats 1.8% death rate. I'll definitely take .01% chance hospitalisation almost 2% chance death lol Literally 3rd bullet point: ""There limited data safety covid-19 vaccines people pregnant."" going say lasts longer would obvious lie, there's data support statement. Likely repeated small exposures make something immune naive problems future.

OC43 likely caused russian flu pandemic, today youths adults mild cold, occasionally causing viral pneumonia babies elderly. article particular virus. interesting read. want time travel test people future? That’s way get information. get 2nd Pfizer shot week, I'm part. I'm saying intentionally get controlling people (at least hope not), think sometimes fully appreciate harm suggestions make people. Health Service Executive. joke, right? Shots perpetuity life! vaccine work 38hr/week. year 40 paid days off. sick risk getting fired. sick leave paid well. also got company car, phone, laptop. Y’all getting screwed big time. We'll get vaccination opened general public everyone's chance get theirs. point - contingent deaths/hospitalizations low, *should* broadly vaccinated population - time done masks distancing. they. implying EU completely screw vaccine purchasing agreements?

He said ""Not EU made glaring errors"", clearly isn't. US also waste time cheap Pfizer negotiated good purchasing agreements took care citizens.

The EU shortage Pfizer vaccines, Pfizer overdelivering.

The US better mainly rely AZ vaccines severely underdelivered pretty much every region export ban. Even less efficacy, won’t still lower transmission? Hasn’t evidence pointed carrier covid vaccinated still render transmission almost nil? 

I hope talk news never do.  called Dunning-Kruger Effect :-) understand that, really know means. Saying 95% effective makes sound like totally probabilistic thing, there's underlying reason 5% case. left chance, factors consider.

I'm basically trying figure know causes 5% ineffectiveness. No, mask protects everyone else.....that's mainly for.  can't wear masks others not, impossible enforce correctly.  need wait numbers reasonably low level first, happen summer. flu spread relatively unchecked century, vaccines 60% population best takes every year. Yet never passports it. now? Nothing flu changed, effective treatments it. person micromanaged, agree. college degree. I’m looking new job. one horse shit hospitals I’ve worked states let call 4-5 times 5th-6th give verbal warning, 6-7 write you’re fired. That’s year span, let’s say called today, I’d wait April 1 2022 fall off. know upset,

How even issue beyond me. Yes, EU great job vaccines! /s wonder much Chinese pay statement. credible organization? train passed year ago.

""Organisation backed nation utilised Patriot Act stop export vaccines countries tells countries get act together"" Right likely like flu shot ? year hopefully don’t get strain that’s resistant vaccine Wonderful! lucked spare dose month eligible. almost said no. I'm all, ""that's insane."" 


I feel MUCH BETTER vaccinated. I'm ready help community get theirs. This. We've vaccinated 30% - growing - entire population capacity. Uptick? Certainly. Wave? Probably not. 

Of course, think uptick mostly preventable, articles feed PTSD previous waves. Virginian - Fucking finally. Exactly... p1 joke. Cool. United anyone never hacks never sells information.

The fact people even trying reconcile sense human rights liberty mind boggling. Programs like never stop ""oh, covid vaccine passport"" inherently leads path ever increasing social control government. Yep, they're giving kids 1 shots pull like 4 different needles. Hell, vaccines known acronym shit protect (MMR, D-TaP whatnot) what’s HSE think that's across board. Maryland standard (depending business size) 10 sick days year. definitely overstatement long shot. Every full time job worth anything offers PTO. Sick days mandated law numerous states.

Take days them. lot ""I get trouble take days off"" attitude self imposed. used feel awkward putting time PTO thought people cared. realized earned days use like. Despite shitty exploitative industries/sectors Canada (contract, seasonal work, etc) still far labor protection law compared US guaranteed holiday pay protected (unpaid) sick days. things still rough many people many places still absolutely nail taking days working holidays. that's choice. want protect themselves, that's them. could always move state ran different political party whatever choose! What’s people today sticks asses.

Joke's you, ALWAYS stick ass reasoning takes time body produce viral load (in case proteins associated virus) takes time immune system recognize build antibodies responsible. 

Hence adults experience (mild) immune response symptoms later stages first dose second dose. 

A fast immune response first dose seems appropriate body template available IE via infection asymptomatic otherwise. 

To confirm we’d need administer antibody tests individuals vaccine compare v-safe data. Doable outside reach. Africans don’t need $$$, regardless many billions, trillions superzillions supposedly sending. need vaccines arms EU stealing those. right live. think get budge line ahead them? Even complete buy-in countries, implementation plan would still take months produce substantial results, i.e. herd immunity. Fucking ban travel Brazil RIGHT NOW. Seriously, fuck waiting for?? P1 joke. I'm skeptical survey people report symptoms themselves, especially leading one something vague ""fatigue"".

For symptoms like ""vomiting"", non-stop 5 weeks beginning 5 weeks after? former seems highly unlikely latter could easily different cause people would report same. 69420 days effective Personally, *enjoy* getting cold/flu something really ever think go way avoid. assume I'll get one every years like people ""suffer"" bit days. 2nd shot Pfizer yesterday, couple hours sore muscle arm injection site, nothing else, fever headache etc. Wait. flu shot due amount variants flu produces year. suddenly immune old strains anymore.

Is correct knowledge vaccine? need virologist lol. Well sure. Plus think people informal work developing world. dead next time something like comes around.  Phizer right arm. j&amp;J left.
4d vision better imho. Same, went couple week ago six month follow up. 6 months pfft.

say hello lockdowns time 1. videos people refusing wears masks airplanes americans;

2. think already post pandemic, brain dead;

3. know country mask requirement, must also know must far behind european countries. everyone us immunosuppresants, vaccine may effective. They're starting study us. media nothing cover Covid gone. It’s big money maker. J&amp;J also developed Europe/Belgium Janssen Pharma. Well certainly say *not batman* I'd take yes Totally, that's goal. That's got this. early childhood strong desire control peoples lives make everyone absolutely miserable long lived long.

I swear, half sub probably subscribes CueAnon bullshit. People vaccinated Phase 1 receive quite vaccine Pfizer used Phase 3, IIRC. 40 yo male got Moderna two week. day half. India's bottleneck distribution production though, it?

Otherwise literally makes zero sense they'd exporting doses all. agree you! I'm science believer- messaging gotten hand one. Somehow message ""you still get spread covid vaccination"" took hold, message past current data suggests ""you unlikely contract covid even less likely transmit covid vaccination."" Even CDC built post vaccination guidance around premise. great news!

But messaging atrocious- biggest science vaccine supporters feel spread word ""we know yet"" ""you still spread it."" there's lot disinformation spreading anti-vax/covid denier side things, may equivalent opposite side spectrum.

On bright side- I'm hopeful within 8-10 weeks infection numbers speak themselves! ""Rub lavender lemon oil chest prevent covid symptoms"" What, vulnerable people going need ongoing booster shots quickly mutating virus? course know that.  might reach 40% adults vaccinated Saturday. 

+0.2 increase people 65% vaccinated. Definitely slowing significantly. 

Over 200 million doses delivered.  Even public colleges universities vaccine requirements. get booster grad school, didn’t couldn’t register classes Thanks Unlikely. things patented fine tuning details probably remain trade secrets. 🚀🚀🚀 don’t think feel like need continue sharing level antibody test results.

But double blind study originally. really? I'm convinced illinois urban legend outside cook county. seen conspiracy nut while. CDC says it’s longer necessary, it’s longer necessary. then. agree it’s still useful.  I’m frustrated (meaning cdc/fda alongside previous administration) passed idea instant tests higher efficacy rate people infectious last summer.  could part great plans. would tweaked like crazy best utilized. work well, called yellow card system individuals also add well professionals. kind 'cover-up' relatives would go tabloids. Please scare people unnecessarily. “Cases won’t go back up!”

“Ok cases went back expected, hospitalizations won’t!”

“Ok hospitalizations up, much last time!”

And don’t need squirt see 20% rise. Ok, vaccine manufacturers preparing create new boosters? public health experts would us live 100 absolutely miserable. see 60% mentioned lot first dose Pfizer seen [provide kid rapid onset reaction would apparatus body able recognize virus would indicate body previously developed antibodies.

I think necessarily true. 1 month pace looking pretty solid. Pandora’s box opened though. honestly say it’s ok let virus spread unchecked last year we’ve gone through? ate forbidden fruit turning back. No, much mundane that. Unfortunately really willing go detail small industry. earth produce vaccines? Covax meant countries like South Korea Yup people getting nature's vaccine point. Wheres data moderna? used person too, mostly terrified I'd fired shitty minimum wage job. worked restaurant, even periodically run bathroom puke, owner/manager let go home (huge food safety violation). *one* time called year half there, sent multi-paragraph email angry were, let everyone down, etc. eventually shut corporate owner said untoward things BLM mass email employees (long left, surprised whatsoever).

Now work union job need fear calling out, still hard train mindset. Even I'm legitimately ill unable job, still feel like called I'm going get boss's bad side. hate see that. Hopefully vaccine production keep ramping start getting supplies there. Even true, people idiots. That’s what’s important. It’s principle behind it. Yes, Facebook ban people information precluded 1A. doesn’t take mean it’s spirit American values. 💎✊💎 Reported misinformation point CDC said vaccinated people longer need wear masks general (yet.) may cause issues trying kids.

Where linked article stated implied? False information mitigation measures, vaccines, etc. pick one stops dying. 

which them. Im assuming means unessential activities. Christmas essential. Spring Break essential. Thanksgiving essential. Super Bowl parties essential. Memorial Day essential. Labor Day essential. July 4th parties essential. going say going bars essential reality no, bars essential. 

Im thinking adds human behavior selfish stupid tend be. could end world hunger time everybody’s got theirs. AIDS primarily infect gay men iv drug users would cure 90s.

People gonna people plenty government wrong. Like forcing companies home office opening schools. Instead restrict civil liberties. interested companies donate think. 3rd wave could avoided. Yeah, turn TV. See that's going whole Amazon fight. literally creating fake tweets undercut attempt. That's far anti-union sentiment country. theory, mean actually can. store demands see medical information I’m vaccinated.

I envision something invasive. bluetooth NFR-based app phone authenticates vaccinated trusted third party transmit identity medical information store. would work similarly contact tracing app tech Google Apple developed last year, uses bluetooth transmit personally-identifying gay person reminds 80’s banks would require single men get hiv test getting mortgage.

I hear point different things. COVID-19 case minority people CHOOSING ignore science put health OTHERS risk so. known time. J&amp;J get one shot vac numbers explode bet! It’s good, happens! :) America handled pandemic terribly, idea America shithole country Reddit trope. none them? I'm vendor grocery stores. made appointment got shot middle day. Got it, kept working problems sore arm. I'd say job analogous workout (I drag 2500 lb pallets regularly) news media population large go easy folk. experience they're mostly anti-science, seditionist, theocratic nationals biding time get bat signal commit atrocities fellow Americans. They're ticking time bomb, inmho. yeah, height hypocrisy.  
 
Using logic: many doses EU exported India? Oh, none? Well guess EU awful vaccine nationalists then, stop asking India gifts gives nothing back. first ""we""...you overlords mandated take screaming berating forcing actual evidence fact loads contradictions lies. 

ok lists ingredients...tell what's besides rna reverse transcriptase.....WHAT Ingredients...oh ya know every doctor know go along higher ups tell Asymptomatic infection still reduced levels transmission vs active symptom producing infection. ..You know understand there's debate here. go find killed everyone count up. 

We go look heart disease deaths year compare previous years. common death types like accidents cancer. 

Then add everything known values see what's left compare number COVID deaths reported. Again, science decision. 

A person make decision much personal risk they’re willing take public good. 

I know it’s semantics, since people using “science/anti-science labels” shield completely shut discussion particular vaccine, it’s important distinguish two.  dad got first dose yesterday. He's public school teacher eligible. That's one less person bring covid house. Also Australia place New Zealand they’re using Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine recommended regulators. Lotta people gotta agree would downvoted oblivion. I'm making claim average nurse intelligent relative doctor.

reading really hard you, huh? sister got first shot today! think right, record vaccination numbers coming April bet. learned live flu changing absolutely nothing behavior flu season. necessarily hard make happen, digital app quick scan phone could even bluetooth-based app checks walk similar technology Google Microsoft developed contract tracing last year. Honestly thank god he's started publicly say kind thing Best ask primary care provider. Today Show ran piece morning saying cdc announced 345k total deaths virus last year making third leading cause death. thought 500k year ended? dreaming?  Lol reality Americans.

Zero percent true. Stop making lived experience statistical lie. Keep submissions topic. civil spread misinformation. they? We’re massively vaccinated getting better every day. 

I don’t see signs “out control” diagnose headache situation nothing like OP explained thought ""soft"" take sick time. idea infection still happens, virus particle gets inside cell starts thing immune system turns takes care it. That's technically infection. know get ""sterilizing immunity"" yet, all. happens enough times, theoretical possibility could spread it.

In real world, really unlikely. expecting people work fevers worse else grit? people different reactions you, make better them. people hardly side effects all, mean they're superior people way implying. Except reasons vaccine hesitancy based science

I agree need deal Stacy I’m tired excuses hundred million Americans gotten it

It’s selfish jot inform potentially kills people corona keeps peoples livlihoods shut Exactly many years left. lost cousin 55.  fat special needs congregate care guess f#€k right? 

At least that’s rabidly prolife colleagues seem imply. 

I mentioned conversation yesterday evangelical since topic asked thought would died year without covid.  said well never know it’s time God call home there’s nothing it. 

Meanwhile colleague (has maskless denier get go) covid around Christmas spread 12 family members 3 ended hospital least couple days.  uses experience testament Covid really bad didn’t kill father really pneumonia (not Covid) gave trouble. thinks I’m one denial. 

I can’t freaking conversations anymore. It’s idiotic. Merkel promised give every adult option vaccination September. reason party needs tank next election. looking things going miss target ratings dropping like crazy. could won’t even next government, never mind lead it.

I sad additional deaths, least might get legal weed. that’s nice. yet official CDC policy. know absolute certainty, no. course not. extremely probable. Happy? expect get yearly Covid shot like get yearly flu shot I'm perfectly ok that. testing readily available go get tested.

no one diagnose headache internet.

allergies cause sorts problems. cold. flu... sorry! Ah see white supremacy continues. Ruined homelands centuries still continue believe superior race people. ashamed. God wish would make flu vaccine quick Covid shots be. mean, quick, seems like Dr always spend ten minutes filling forms putzing around vials even come out. tfw 2 passports dual-vaccinal citizen resides within united federations zero covid Isn’t asymptomatic transmission minor contributor overall transmission? recent survey found majority people U.K. don’t comply self isolation symptoms (the support payments shit here), efficacy symptomatic transmission relevant, especially includes presymptomatic. cant help killer headache 24 hours first shot, finally broke took advil. Could delayed reaction shot. could something else completely. Repost Story time:

Coronaviruses account 10-15% common colds. 

In 90s, [a study volunteers challenged (purposely infected) common cold coronavirus. became infected developed cold symptoms. Measurements anti-coronavirus antibodies taken consistently thereafter. antibody levels peaked 2 weeks infection, slowly declined consistently that.

1 year later, group re-challenged virus. volunteers reinfected second challenge - HOWEVER, found shed virus less time year importantly, *none* developed cold symptoms.

Again, *even if* studies show antibody levels Sars-CoV-2 diminish time vaccination *this mean* therefore unprotected COVID-19. *may be* robust level protection remains which, though enough completely block reproduction virus, enough keep us severe even lightly symptomatic illness. country get paid full sick 6 weeks.

after health insurance pays 70% salary

mental live US Unlikely. CEO Moderna said possible mRNA vaccines could effective couple years. guessing course new data encouraging Pfizer similar vaccine. course possible we'll need get boosters variants emerge time tell that. Yeah governments need show they're something, people feel safer. like month ago France said ""we're lockdown instead tighten borders protect people"" vaccine provide much protection case. said far certain would infected. act like may though get test days. enthused prospect getting vaccine every 6 months. Hopefully SARS-CoV-2 goes away soon. American healthcare/work system joke. Lucky."
