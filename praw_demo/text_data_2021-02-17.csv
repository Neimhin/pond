These kind people need see 1 person follow rules rules lose meaning never followed. probably saw 1 cop without mask duty, set stone refusal put one ever Imagine much money spendt this

Florida Man never thinks much money he's wasting, connect dots like this. did, Florida Man Rip Germany. Schools reopen days cases rising right now. respectfully disagree. changed statements numerous times without data, instead said thinks people need hear. He's constantly pessimistic consider negative impacts lock downs including mental health, economy, business, jobs, homelessness, etc. need balance things said public. it’s cold-causing coronavirus core. reason it’s problematic us it’s novel zero immunity it. type immunity it, turns sniffles most.

It join list already circulating endemic coronaviruses cause seasonal colds.

Plus, shares similarities SARS MERS, it’s deadly two. Like 99 percent people get Covid survive. deadliness factor kind caused burn out. symptoms showed dealt with.

Of course, always watch Covid population while. soon people vaccinated aren’t get immunity Covid catching virus, alright. Getting vaccinated Tuesday. shots, I’m gonna go restaurant, get way drunk, leave big ole tip. haven’t sat place eat since like June. Perfect attendance still thing unfortunately. Add attendance requirement DCF agency called concerning child welfare. socioeconomic side parents feel push work make ends meet since many living poverty still. cliched COVID related depression, put weight marriage breaking guy. 

It’s good news here. source that? Absolutely food shortages am. teacher lecture parents every year: keep sick kids home. best kids get sick (which best) likely get sick students affected take days work feeling like crap. Anything catch kid get back. Or, everyone able connect pandemic send work it’s going while. Please please keep sick kids home. (I work private school everyone nanny’s maids keeping kid home isn’t burden parent’s work) Seriously? 90% number includes data 8-21 days first dose (when immune system already kicked in). sub-analysis. course going higher efficacy immune system starts reacting mRNA. getting exposed days 1 7 shot likely much benefit, that's overall number 21-day period lower. dunno quoted saying ""by Christmas"" recently. kills me.

Vaccination sites setup communities color turn away people clearly communities trying get vaccinations. Hospital staff pulled non-local patients line communities snuck hospitals get vaccinated ahead them.

The goal make sure communities left behind vaccination like deaths mounted initial outbreak.

The problem actual safeguards ensuring equity vaccine distribution. put sites wherever want, stop people cars traveling sites access supply. short use local supplies, spread use someone else's. 

This happening, whether fits world view not. reality, handwaved clinging sociological theories, surprising given display human self interest (albeit great displays human selflessness well) length pandemic.

There people communities may want vaccine. community. telling many want cannot receive doses going local arms. 

The system literally setup drive 20 miles get shot reserve dose location. totally ignores injection site setup area first place goal increased access local population. Speaking vaccination rates communities without considering increased demand placed local supplies myopic. 

It useful study reporting ""2% people getting cut buffet line get jumbo shrimp. Let's examine may be."" think ending speak. gigantic fear workers students calling sick aren't. Moreover, corporations willing pay staffing accommodate sick calls. stretch people thin foster culture ostracizes ""being weak link"" calling sick.

""Well, DEBRA worked flu. Imagine much slack she'll pick stay home. really want repay like that?""

This line thinking considerate make be. motivated purely desire hit numbers. come never needed prove vaccination disease now. sudden Corona vaccine must? constantly told last year ""over Easter"" ""over summer"" one point bojo started bringing hopes ""normality Christmas"" summertime bit nuanced that. efficacy usually different mild severe illness death. Fortunately vaccines effective severe outcomes. might 68% mild illness 98% hospitalization death. Right NYC essential workers underlying conditions (regardless age) eligible vaccines. pharmacies apparently? Seems like strange rule. important look numbers closely. low end range often mild moderate illness, sometimes number represents average period time includes time shot became effective. one explanation. actually give shit healthy children, money.  true. use teams, students send direct questions reply phone computer without missing beat. It’s art usually snap photo work shoot over. One friends 70+ year old colleague 30 yo 911 dispatcher. think percolating while. already idea AstraZeneca vaccine. think needed enough data come in.  Chickenpox still regarded way UK, kids peers offered chickenpox vaccines 90s mum made share cups friend's kid try get way toddler. think yes potentially. even increased time doses 4 weeks say 4 months, would allow us get everyone first shot lot sooner. maybe say high risk group get one shot. Would game changer. woman alopecia, people care female hairloss, one wants study women general hormones, probably know another decade so. I’m pointing literally impossible contract AZ UK august, building plants UK’s money months that. Mine tried award perfect attendance end December last year. actually got it. Literally everyone received incredulous best, especially knew might coming back Christmas due ANOTHER lockdown. never said implied was. sure you’re trolling stupid. you’re fun trolling pandemic need seriously evaluate life grow up. Covid issue one taken lightly. 

The 18-49 (“military aged folks“) contain 50% infections 26% hospitalized. reading comprehension skills, death complication caused Covid. legally supposed accomodations children. Home study etc makes sound like viral evolution thing Frieza revealing final form, I'm pretty sure that's works. Brazilian strain? ever hear news it? There’s 3rd wave now? Ugh EU's mistake counting UK supply vaccines midst Brexit fallout. produced vaccines EU. “Now you’ve read click see bunch child actors look like now.” evidence whatsoever. in-laws 80's made changes lifestyle, got groceries delivered, ate home, travel visit family, spent time phone zoom, etc. really rocket science. still understand at-risk population past year. remember freshman junior year high school absent 10 days dropped semester repeat grade wouldn’t enough credits pass. wonder policy working now. one side: ""a subset population bad opinions"".

On side: ""socializing knew halted, able many loved ones year, nursing home residents dying dignity-free deaths total isolation, childhood development across country stunted, exercise outdoor leisure time breath freely shunned voracious moral panic modern history many places legally prohibited, physical boundaries work home lives eroded rendering life endless cycle screen time, people trained view human beings six-foot death radii, livelihoods permanently wiped out, favorite places go community shuttered, one public faces anymore"".

There nothing even close equivalency two suggest otherwise disgusting. friend high school also excellent grades summer school graduate based solely attendance. sick basically school doctors kept accusing faking. BS clearly mastered content. (She eventually get better doctors get diagnosis treatment legitimate health issues, things got bad took medical leave college semester.) friend mine one 990. physician's assistant profession starting work mass vaccination centre Velodrom week. description, offer get vaccinated pretty last minute, jumped chance. vaccinated Sunday morning. hardly believe luck simultaneously bit puzzled others want it. Opposite here. Negligible whities 64. I’m freak! train kids work sickness put undue burden employer. need build strong compliant cogs. Thankfully school district got rid couple years ago. Really dumbest award ever. Especially look many kids need braces, etc. Try getting ortho appt every month without missing class time. Unlikely easy! 130 feel free develop vaccine produce mass scale. Let's try. evil someone threaten pull vaccines citizens supposed serve? give people dont spread first. Front line workers priority. Honestly sure policy. determined 80-90% serious illnesses fatalities 12-15% population, clear dividing line. Rather lock 85% people benefit 15%.

When problem something like breast cancer identify target population help outreach, prevention treatment. worry people affected. screening breast cancer among men little risk.

But virus treated everyone equally imposed lockdowns restrictions everyone. People age 25 extremely low risk virus, low countless risks take daily basis, lives upended year sake sick people aged 70+ never saw. really make sense. Yup. Mentally ill mom multiple full blown episodes year medical family emergencies. remember eleven guidance counselor laugh say needed quit tricking parents letting stay home wasn’t sick she’d send truancy police parents arrest laziness. Oh focused mom didn’t realize dying month organs started shutting down. Talk pressure. already moderately parentified child get treated way school system non understanding adults around me. tell truth hadnt grown freaking sensitive massive guilt complex really might tried terrorize people cruel. Poor, different, dysfunctional, forgotten actively dismissed marred people’s view see us. 

I remember child knowing couldn’t go hospital school accepted ten hospital notes year, used seven mother already found HSP Henoch-Schönlein Purpera. go school dying avoid arresting parents. America fucking sucks. much good squash policy. Yup. Likely blood ""clotty""..... You’d think mr data scientist would better things complain imaginary internet points, yet Paywall wasn’t dangerous cold. weren’t pandemic before. ""What cost lies"" Wow, fuck NBC. NBC = News Comcast Novavax makes even antibodies 50-60% efficacious symptomatic disease. antibodies nothing all, others work fine, end result unknown vaccines. hope cellular immunity still protect severe disease, actual data all. 

In absence anything that's actually known, headline writers gonna keep making things up. want frustrated read this:  got nasty cold years ago coughed like 6 months. Long-haulers exclusive covid ever leave house first place? real reason variants “reduce effectiveness” scary, shows direction virus mutating in. Yes vaccines still neutralize ones, literally see spike protein changing slow motion. worrying. Mutation continue new variants continue evolve. it’s important stop community spread right now. pregnant wife teaching person months. done couple weeks get ready birth, absolutely option given work home teach remote kids whose parents option. teachers seen potentially expendable even vulnerable teachers like wife others two options: say, quit altogether. want quit, so... Wel yes, look contracts agreements available us. What’s written contracts don’t know speculate Lmao oh Reddit “this fine” created humbling experiences U.S. diplomats representing world’s wealthiest country.

Are supposed feel sorry them? ass.  think great idea policy makers need balance concerns virus concerns -- mental health, jobs, businesses, education, etc. past year things somehow forgotten. We're supposed thing PTO company makes exception sickness. 

FWIW state would make employer pay Pto week think would cover person disability unemployment  I’ve trekked gorillas Uganda Rwanda officially you’re right, common gorillas get reeeeeaaaaaal close personal. You’re allowed approach them, whatever fuck want. 

There always rules going cold/flu symptoms infect apes. I’m surprised they’re still allowing trekking all, can’t imagine many international tourists right now. blame media social media well. ""SAVING LIVES"" mentioned feeling slightly suicidal restrictions ""but life"". hypocrisy still astounding live eastern NC friends teachers said haven’t gotten yet. schools open essential workers? brand covid seems like ACE-2 receptors. Leydig cells testes shown ACE-2 receptors cells important production testosterone body spermatogenesis. seen different interpretations data like suggests 90%.  quite get whole ""we vaccinate poorer countries also mutations pop up."" Mutations pop anywhere. difference, mutation perspective, vaccinating 1 million people UK vs 1 million people Somalia? long overall total number vaccinations going up, issue mutations lessens correct? layperson's interpretation erred side caution. pretty sure 2nd dose would give protection longer protection regimen developed tested. tested, want deviate even additional data came in, vaccine tested specifically deviate testing results uncertain. can't change anything else vaccine, dose, stored, etc. can't change two-dose regimen.

However increasing data single dose effective. Even resisting making changes name safety. guess finally become convinced. probably due part studies done Israel 1 million people, essentially much larger clinical trial.

So short took figure out. almost failed sophomore year bc emergency surgery, dr notes, bc missed many days one semester. 🤦🏻‍♀️ One dude 80. many 80+ US marshals? earth would think Christmas would normal? Ok. Thank you. Articles read gave impression almost WANT strong reaction. guess misinterpreted context. could, didn't. 

The game fair, pay more, get earlier access, think almost billion dollars vaccines Pfizer paid manufacturing equipment? Let put way, even half population degree immunity kids mess.That's Schools last shut first reopen country probably many countries.

20% 0.2 r number high enough virus survive. needs greater 1 virus spread. mathematically ignorant case me.

As trusting experts, said Thalidomide safe wasn't. medicine either, think Chernobyl, various hydro damn collapses mishaps.

I think find comes medicine burden proof manufacturers designers prove safe, customers prove unsafe. Given long term data know could possibly prove safe.

As said things like Oxford vaccine seem much safer also cheaper easier distribute seeing used much outside UK understand. Russian vaccine, Chinese vaccine. trying new medical technology tested properly long period time first. right believe people fully submit government. 

I, US, not. Sheesh America crazy. I've never even scolded calling sick work. So; comparison: estimate ramifications general population’s health one vaccinated – Covid-19 effectively welcome go rampage mutate much wants – opposed possible ramifications fully-vaccinated population? I’m sure you’d reach conclusion, there’s really choice. is, you’re 100% willing sacrifice others’ lives protection body. learned lesson Star Trek. powering delusions thinking simple denobulan flu, next thing know control alien trying sabotage ship.

Some diseases meant powered through. meant fought back bed rest plenty liquids. Knowing difference two vital. Fair enough still I've family go Florida church service separated masks masks idiotic take. served lined took ordered us - GQP bowing anti-vaxxers ridiculous. 'It's pretty terrifying'

That describes pretty well. US elsewhere, one button, keep pushing it. making plan ending lockdowns even considering exploring options. gone completely blank. Sorry poor humor, stated hoped would fall off, balls is. going thru difficult divorce know marriage amazing challenges better I. Exactly. It’s time open things save sanity! think little chance fully learn experience.

For example, new norm one sick wear mask work public settings cannot stay home. also positive significant portion population would find tyrannical government oversight. Always needs huge, unacceptable behavior defying confidence something crucial, needs front page ASAP family buried someone week, ok. (Eye roll.) Easy beginning. alcohol prohibited shit beer well took decades people get hold market top producers. many options craft beer nice. Weed eventually get way. first see big corporations buying market controlling it. get tired crap weed eventually lead better things. tax revenue much needed states lack taxation wealthy. instead raise property taxes residents counties rely influx tax money. Yeah, great time developing feelings someone lives overseas coming home 3 weeks world shut down.

Even better, lives country *scary variants* can't even daydream another visit who-knows-when. family kind me. family sucks. support system here. I'm afraid I'll never feel kind love acceptance again. hypothetical, people countries *are* getting vaccinated US. unethical magnitudes difficult obtain shot countries? That's whole different question. [Spanish go walk. talk people. Please get out, make best surroundings. Log reddit. cant, look fun things get excited about. instance massive historical space event today. watch live here, starts hour: popcorn feel connected us monumental day! Go USA! vaccines least two dose regimens. However, second dose usually quickly. assumption Pfizer Moderna designed 3/4 week intervals second dose speed trial results. can’t results enrollees fully innoculated according trial design.

In retrospect, unfortunately didn’t simultaneously run trials single shot protocol. know feel. (I'm Poland. us additionally Catholic Church akin government branch.) think make funny joke, Common Core math prove correct. much many correct. Yes. That's pandemic raging utterly mismanaged many countries. Economies suffering folks quarantining/distancing months. 
There plenty good reasons feel bad right now. kinda want argue lot, also want get icky germs. Present idea realistic feasible achieve want. plenty things use time none fulfilling actually people. that’s still year stolen, especially considering I’m college normal year exact opposite spending day home alone watching TV Next week 2023... I’m opinion Florida actually things right. It’s time let people live sake mental health. Florida 28th cases/capita right now, it’s though less restrictive measures severely detrimental. can't would be. cannot personally empty wallet end homelessness doesn’t mean can’t believe it’s unfair conditions exist lead small portion population hoard money others homeless.

If really believed saying, would taking actions end homelessness humans going hungry. COULD this, won't, exact reasons could give limited supply vaccines others, won't. 

I hate hypocrites. Apparently BioNTech vaccine produces third antibodies South African variant original virus. feel like it’s that. feel anti-vaxx people coming here. hate anti-vaxxers much. fair SII, started manufacturing vaccine completion trials. essentially gamble risk taken SII ensure fast supply vaccines soon trials wrapped vaccines approved. 
A pvt company took gamble Oxford vaccine luckily actually worked  Particularly problematic Thailand US, (I believe) use PCR testing exclusively N gene targets. Someone surely correct I'm mistaken. exactly it. Almost news turning positive none ""experts"" know think. start babble say things completely unrelated reality. pretty odd. water wet, what's US... virus spread easily

That's first time I've heard someone say COVID. Would interested read anything support position. good untill indians ready get vaccine ..at rate ..it'll take india 3-7yrs vaccinate whole population (added exponential growth)

Main reason can't choose two vaccines
Covaxin Covishield

Covaxin still disclosed efficiency data yet phase 3 trail never ended..


Like countries.. Leaders took vaccine people boost confidence ..India's Ministers yet take Exactly bill gates said 3 shots today lmao  No, type positive! Yeah, clickbait. Number deaths reported page total number deaths received coded date analysis represent deaths occurred period. Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range **1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death** link scientific study peer reviewed paper 100% confirms this? Thanks. Last year work end year like "" make sure use PTO"" got sick time left. came could barely sit right LAB. higher came giving vendor tour. barely got words careful I'm sick. asked work? response: HR said need learn schedule PTO better. sent home pay concession schedule PTO properly. get paid extra day running fever get well though. people hold ideal "" tough comein"" still going around silently judging everyone making moves work place fuck people over. wouldnt sure. 81 year old US Marshall. Lol think going fool? Yup. Fewer people sub? Less interest? Dunno. Hindsight. 

In beginning, didn’t know vulnerable impact vulnerability. Also, younger caught virus didn’t know extent illness long symptoms would last. world working real-time information ever-increasing death rate, even nearly global quarantine efforts. 

If followed proper protocols beginning, like countries faster, successful recoveries, would already. seeing headlines uk sa versions like ig consensus coronavirus little flu open up, except china exceedingly dangerous? media watching that? Maybe time switch sth else... Deflect me! Yep data supports this. nothing vaccinating poor countries, problem rich countries hoarding supply vaccines. Canada, nation around 30 million, bought 100 million doses vaccines. poorer nations (mainly africa) rely handouts UN. science back going school pre cautions actually good? mention good students sake support teachers getting vaccinated, condition schools re-open afterwards. wonder criteria are? I’m taking meds seeing therapist, I’m definitely anxious depressed pandemic. WINTER STORM 👋👋👋👋👋 sex time strangers, YOLO!

is even fair comparison? see plenty ""cut dick off"" online, really see people advocating people even riskier lives pre-covid. people want shit already doing, like going bar. last saw mom person Christmas 2019. 77 let's say heavily Red rural area taking seriously, one many stressors whether I'll ever see person again.

Now vaccines starting rolled serious volume I'm hopeful I'm also far past furious poorly done burst crying sometimes. can't even figure mad at. 

They plenty time setup systems distribute track. Instead we're stupid shit always mix public private sector elderly neighbors (based NextDoor) spending time every morning calling browsing everywhere might vaccine trying set appointment. Bro, I’ve noticing vaccine posts getting less upvotes every day. No, I'm arguing past thought release modern scholarship showed case. leave that, wrong, looking old assumptions fueled Cold War distrust come conclusion 80's much like anti-China animus fueling lot people blaming china today. Wanna cite that? trying demonize teachers unions? know that’s strategy / talking point circulating among GOP. let’s hear it. Name names. fractionally true bullshit taken context spun outrage brewers Fox?

Getting little tired transparently coordinated talking points wedge issue fear mongering. in- 1 3 adults self aware/honest enough realize admit depressed/anxious due COVID. That’s mass testing. Mass testing testing random people reason try identify isolate cases measure population prevalence. That’s tests widely available given low threshold. Would Uk able pull Brexit? long-term effects think others people get long-term effects? change outcomes symptomatic? Last week sub thought multiplied, based data Israel.

I hope like escape strains. 60% efficacy severe disease prevent lockdowns next winter. happened.

That's precisely happened, think fuss happening?

The EU expect receive production UK, sure hell expect receive 0 UK government allow AstraZeneca balance production yields plants.

That's UK govt AZ wrong - first ban exports private company EU making fail contractual obligations, AZ over-promise under-deliver massive amounts.

Also despicable bragging shaming UK EU bad deal, ""best effort"" clause ""delay signing contract"", reality UK exact thing similar time windows. Turning vaccine covid 19 race show Brexit best thing disgusting. Yeah read study, anxiety mostly related lockdowns, etc., fear getting virus mixed in. I’m scared learn 2/3s anxious depressed  case developed countries food security US among best world could judge us seeing magnificent display love endless breadsticks?

New Mexico wasn’t list I’ll give shot. could finally start bee farm.  Given that's smart thing do, I'm sure well way late make difference. 93% reduction stacked top 93% reduction symptomatic disease? Meaning far far higher 93%? Well, I'm mandatory quarantine 2 weeks coming canada, that's I'll going stores restaurants climbing gym again. whatsoever before

also got see vaccinated family left too, nice course mutations worrisome, hardly likely single mutation set us back March 2020. Especially true vaccines mRNA technology  perspective, already dropping pandemic due poverty opioid use. 9/10 moms agree  yea there’s debate that. bunch redditors know nothing still downvote saying lol Wow.. variant detectable PCR tests would really suck doesn’t align experiences involved parent. perfect attendance thing something kids parents, even sahm’s, experiences anecdotal therefore representative everywhere. 2 lying Thankfully actual shit though! (Crohn's patient, poop humor given) Good luck, hope works you! Yeah edited post obvious yeah next time guess I'll try obvious. politicians saying I'd board. least state California gonna keep shit going foreseeable future. never discuss kind light end tunnel. ""32.33%, ughhh, repeating course..."" Yeah get it. aunt uncle (he leukemia remission!!!) went resort Mexico Christmas. raving whole place plane tickets cheap stuff. really wealthy get travel world every year frustrating.


Everyone sacrificing keep people safe huge risk group take advantage situation go great time beach feel entitled it?? mean I'm glad good time I'm even seeing family Christmas want get sick I'm sure works, possible immigrate easily Ireland Northern Ireland? Miguel Jr. said. “It ECMO death.” 

More like ECMO death. I've never seen single patient hospital I've worked survive ECMO week (they recover, die). last resort last resorts; intensive, expensive, often futile. hey let's kill healthcare staff making work 1000% save people, that's totally signed half COVID-19 patients undergoing ECMO die hospital, according 3,400 COVID-19 patients worldwide, though centers reported survival rates high two-thirds. 

Article addresses this. ECMO guaranteed treatment, mindset ""oh put ECMO would survive, Drs wrong,"" terrible attitude propublica propagate. providers probably assumed thing working healthcare seeing ECMO patients; put heroic effort still die. ECMO pretty either, put died anyway, last image would way worse ventilator. 

LAs care sounds like total disaster regardless, less ECMO cure-all denied like corporate red tape BS getting way actual health care. spin article sits wrong me. follow issue real issue isn’t essential workers risk, given haven’t shown higher risk person essenatisl workers, it’s personal teacher fears; many baseless selfish often calling kids vaccinated Obviously scare tactics working well enough. side think I’m arguing here? dont kids, working home, received stimulus checks, earned promotion. Im one unaffected sure thankful, worked hard position work covid happened. literally worked way bottom top decade. really enjoy free time home dont commute work. exercising changing eating habits best also help metal well much. 

To anyone struggling best advice eat healthy get 7hr sleep. close 3rd make sure drink lots water time, take vitamin morning /u/sweetp3achtree pussies Seems like pretty disingenuous excuse there. average member public read scientific study data understand overlap. simply believe they're told press/politicians, highly politicised vaccine personal reasons. Obviously European leaders going around calling ""barely effective"" going cause massive hit public trust vaccine. Infinitely information that's found science journals.  
 
Scientists *responsible* politicians spoken time irresponsible comments thrown around, far, far late point restore faith vaccine that's attacked months.  That’s it? means u/Scryb_Kincaid 's theory infected found area outbreak inevitable baseless. many infections left China, probably thousands, failed spread. virus spread easily. needs concentration develop outbreak superspreader events rare event spread continues slow burn gets extinguished.

There's lot research early infections US support difficultly virus seeding areas. lot done Washington state mistakenly believed wide ranging outbreak early on.

So blaming China obscuring severity virus outbreak, thereby dooming millions across globe slow painful death completely justified. parents came somewhere mean there.  Normalcy back long time ago wealthy privileged, political class. I, maybe 2022, maybe never rate. Lots people getting 15 minutes fame spreading doom public avoiding travel restrictions preach. KN95's really look like coffee filters me.

Probably made using machinery.

Which also explains fit, can't get certified (the fit). think 20% children infecting one person significant given virus normally infects one person per infected person. That's saying 5x less infectious children reading right.

Furthermore vaccines work measles viruses never removed influenza. using influenza terrible example vaccines working influenza always manages come strain beats whatever vaccines creating cat mouse game.

The thing mRNA nobody knows do. even experts. That's problematic perfectly good vaccines based known trusted techniques like Oxford vaccine, Russian vaccine, Novavax, even Sinovac. parents can't afford lose days pay look child, choice send in. Population density good measurement regard. population density low since Sweden huge uninhabited areas, density lot higher areas people actually live. large uninhabited forests affect virus' spread. purpose system

That’s trade is. It’s willingly giving labor time something someone else wants. tools allow sick kid attend class home. teachers video conference thier lessons. kid shows video conference marked absent. literally eradicate spread many diseases time get 100% attendance millions children. easy, everyone would it... pandemic would over. Soon never fast goalposts change. Can't wait announce permanent masks distancing! Maybe try building factories manufacture vaccines like countries ""Expert says"" First paragraph: *""Other variables accounted age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes.""* Right. genders androgens different amounts best thing could possibly improve chances vaccine continue working we're hoping will, reduce cases much possible without reductions occur result vaccine-derived immunity,"" Dr. Michael Mina, epidemiologist immunologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health, said Tuesday event.

 U.S. Tuesday reported 59,500 new COVID-19 cases — far cry six-figure case totals reporting month ago. experts warn infection numbers still high could see another uptick Americans let measures like masks social distancing continue play key role, virus continues circulating high levels, likely often come contact with, try infect, people vaccinated, Mina opportunities give virus come contact somebody immune, opportunities virus find way around level immunity antibodies,"" Mina added. China hiding severity problem fine rest world glean situation actions words. Gotcha. again... China communist constitution says so? Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), sovereign wealth fund managing Sputnik V’s distribution, told Financial Times signed contracts 15 manufacturers 10 countries **to produce 1.4bn jabs**, enough vaccinate 700m people. country **initially planned manufacture 30m** doses end 2020, scaled back plans **just 2.5m** local producers encountered problems acquiring equipment production vaccine’s second dose. Dmitriev said issues resolved. Russia **plans make 33m doses end March**. 

This literally everything need know ability Russia produce vaccine time according contract.

Yes, herd immunity absoluteley useless, profitable pharma China. could sell vaccine ever. say Russia ""Moscow Mordor, Saint Petersburg Isengard"" rest country undermined. I’m remote wfh worker. Hawaii right now? case rate adjusted somewhat based many tests conducted - e.g. right state dashboard shows 29 unadjusted 20 adjusted case rate. immediate impact cases going less immediate impact deaths hospitalizations, since 65 group makes 16% pop 80% deaths. It’s going excellent see death rate drop low levels. Selfish shortsighted. Unfortunately typical coming privilege. 

The wealthy wealthy nations seeded pandemic around world. wealthy suffer. poor suffer. suffer according deserve nothing cure afford purchase deserve full price pestilence exact. even doesn’t last nearly long it’s still probably better get many people immune possible short amount time. Less chances mutation less chances spreading, production/distribution much easier coming months find short coverage. Cue Americans getting upset 50% effective preventing any/all symptoms.

We still know older people (people likely balding) filling hospitals using group study. yes, maybe see correlation overall, know enough young people hospitalized population statistically relevant age group? 90+% people 40 ever even hospitalized, really enough people age group ti something widespread? think would studies huge factor like thread suggesting, fuck sounds like thread thinks baldness akin age heart disease, think know biggest factors are...

Stupid government initiative. everybody someone call babysit sick child moment's notice can't take day work stay home them. I'm American. question case rate!! (In LA least) testing almost 5x rate August, tiers devised, makes sense case rates positivity rates don’t line anymore (eg case rates seem super high).

LA 25/100k would seem purple, positivity rate 6%, solidly red.

Should CA update tier system reflect realistic case rate thresholds, given much testing now? Herd immunity. 140-250 million people already, plus 58 million vaccines girlfriend also refused take vaccine lack data influence fertility understand view that. Sounds good. it’s time get vaccinated, decline say want citizen Mexico get vaccine instead. US doesn’t anything positive test result. Rapid testing would solve COVID. Hurr durr yeah think that, smart Yes, unfair. But, what's wrong rich countries sharing have. could've taken lead created concerted / organized effort finance huge risk stockpiling. Even poor countries could've chipped in.

So now, instead global campaign fight virus, country themselves. What's worse, viruses respect human borders, one nasty variant going go everywhere we're back square one. It’s local news, it’s pretty common ask random people opinion. randomly approached street journalist asking law Congress pass. I’ve always kept kids home sick. Even though I’d take doctor pay $40 get note absence wouldn’t excused.

At LEAST NY state legislature needs revoke emergency powers immediately article day elderly obese spread covid particles. Plus, seems likely hospitals could areas high spread despite strict regulations.

[Per CDC conclusion report school transmission transmission schools associated community transmission. Transmission spread within schools limited strict implementation layered mitigation strategies.14,32,34 community rates COVID-19 high, increased likelihood SARS-CoV-2 introduced to, potentially transmitted within, school setting. Evidence date suggests schools implement mitigation strategies fidelity, transmission within schools limited.

So largely true much spread schools proper mitigation strategies preventative measures universally consistently followed. happen, spread within school occur. 

You wanna make bet kids teachers continue strictly follow rules? **potential** super spreader event definitely since classrooms comprise consistent comingling 20-30 households per class. CDC notes 

Per CDC outbreaks occurred schools, leading closures. Significant secondary transmission SARS-CoV-2 infection occur school settings mitigation strategies implemented followed.

Just like perfectly healthy young grocery workers deemed worthy vaccine, smart idea get ahead potential community transmission vaccinating teachers. 

Besides, teacher gets COVID gets put 2-3+ weeks, also basically negates benefits reopening school teacher's kids. Better vaccinate happen.  True, also get injuries long term pain slipping stairs go get mail something like that. happen mean happen every case, even most. would venture guess 99% young people get covid, even stuck bed week feel sick, back normal weeks, like viruses. could immunity lasts longer. could also robust different variants. could also better blocking transmission. likely worse three regards. Hi, Texas here! public schools funded way. remember high school we’d meter would fill/shrink based many people absent day always strived specific percentage Oh basically giving ""sickness"" twice? make antibodies get antibodies tire die? Interesting. gave updated recommendation regarding PCR testing month ago, advising use less cycles.

Less cycles = less (over-)sensitivity = less positive test results (including less false positives possibly less true positives well)

That change contributing least somewhat fall cases deaths. vaccine still administered small number people, it’s even smaller number account fact current cases deaths reported right probably weeks back.

Edit: also, saw today somewhere Canada they’re increasing cycles again. expect Canada numbers rise weeks despite vaccine progress. mean really Pfizer Moderna, using brand new (and effective) tech. J&amp;J/AZ shouldnt issue. dont understand make good point follow equating said something ridiculous like making gay. 

I'm absolutely saying vaccine causes infertility. understand hesitant specific case.

For worth, vaccine available I'd get right second. 100% effective preventing moderate/severe disease, 78% effective preventing mild disease, 50% effective preventing any/all symptoms.

By comparison, Pfizer Moderna never even tested efficacy mild disease undiagnosed symptoms. Much larger confidence interval meaning could significantly lower 95 percent.

The conclusion agree with, she’s idiot isn’t making logical risk/reward judgement they’re right fire state fire literally reason (although I’m sure lawsuit since seems grey area)

But arguments y’all using get conclusion sketchy AF. Yeah make like 22% population US everyone forgets discussing “herd immunity.”

Even 100% adults got vaccinated, without children, max possible immune vaccine would less 80%. florida lower deaths/capita UK so....  Pretending thing lying yourself.

You're riot!

Caught 180° bullshit still ""no, you"" nonsense.

Nice. know long term effects decades now. kids' school district tried that. First snow day, students expected attend, decided BS played outside instead logging in. Yesterday supposed school day, many homes without power, district cancelled.

Only fantasy see hypothetical situation variant burning vaccinated population, that’s happening FEWER vials. cost living insane, aren’t expecting open things spring 2022? anyone live California? makes perfect sense allowing 6 week grace period teacher vaccinations schools open. problem unions still won’t accept terms regions.

I think unions trying drag things beginning next school year assure teachers get vaccinated return classroom. sad part year half time wasted educational development kids. still shortages **years** now, lot worry about. banned  According them, symptoms considered normal, worry much. You’re telling me. still happy church open, least give credit choosing go online worst peaks area.

I'm Catholic gone Mass since pandemic began -- definitely understand frustrating church still continuing Mass, understand Catholics, Eucharist center faith. Generally, obligation attend every week. Church suspended obligation is, itself, big deal. waiting drag pandemic even longer hurt people.

I know many educators school staff want go back person, anyway. Many choose either go back, take unpaid leave absence. leave field altogether, many done. personally glad back person extent; selfishly speaking, teaching special ed online (and mound paperwork comes along it) way difficult time consuming I’d person. 

My local union stated many times opposed teaching person. want proper safety protocols place. district seeks taking proper precautions terms virus, I’ve questioned safety work nearly daily basis pre-covid. pedantic, really get much effect \~10 days first shot, number would actually whatever number people received least first shot 10 days ago. Lol come logic next time started work March able begin production EU British investment Canada friend live? Remote communities prioritized many extremely limited healthcare facilities. people live often must travel work medical care. BC, even relatively small outbreaks remote places meant transferring patients long distances local facilities got overwhelmed.

Any mass gatherings uncontrolled community spread lead variants. 

So, IMO, need get vulnerable vaccinated, get community spread emergency levels, get adequate ventilation public schools increased space allow social distancing PPE staff students? Sure. Open schools. 

But, back original point, diverted far from, OP thread demanding vaccinated teacher required return work matter what, point variants exist, greater numbers everyday, one them, responding well current vaccines. It’s dangerous difference, illustrate danger uncontrolled spread, thus uncontrolled mutants threaten public health. said *if* variant appeared burning vaccinated population, absolute stance unwise. need able respond reality pandemic is, moment, fantasies think things be. 2 3 depressed reasons. point Redditors slobber Europe much can't even admit Europeans refusing vaccine wait another one coming later stupid.

Lucky you, probably get first shot November I'm lucky.

There light end tunnel, keep pushing know isn’t going life forever. That's plan too. I'll still wear mask outside (it's really uncomfortable point) I'll go back normal otherwise people get vaccinated. correct someone days ago here. 

It's amazing. doubt, blame variants. kids teens bud Good you. Thank thinking others, particularly last semester. say, extra poundage pandemic ruined marriage, wasn’t worth keeping anyway. put scenario category sickness health I’m sorry happened you. Hopefully meet someone worth point. point people going take risks take control mental health? live life deal suicidal thoughts. Drug use suicides up, especially younger people. lives matter? article said, might shift demographics treated. 

In early days NY, instance, basically triage regarding able get help hospitals, people could sick begin with. Yeah shit lol Oh trust me, won't. Spanish flu (which far worse COVID ever be), certainly wont happen, except probably minority people.

You nothing worry sure, I’m tired caring others think. I’d it’s they’d find something else complain about. People love complain get riled hear anything conflicts world view they’ve told think. numbers don’t bear out. thanksgiving Christmas superspreader events you’d expect see big spikes 10-14 days out. saw modest spike early December probably thanksgiving related, almost nothing early January point Christmas outbreaks. think he's intelligent person. I'm glad platform. No, unless US, Europe, countries act concert manufacture distribute vaccine globally, things suppress monitor disease, nation-level vaccination efforts unlikely meaningful durability. basic reality viruses spread without regard borders human constructs. Right now, seem focused protecting pharmaceutical industry IP expense long-term plan actually prevent virus circulating back kicking whole disaster again.

There also plenty countries lockdown, like Vietnam South Korea, suppressed virus manageable levels. following example demonstrable failure US strategy (or complete lack thereof). totally feel that. general education classes much looser attendance policies. wanted point certain programs classes strict attendance policies. feel bad peers would medical issue family problems. labs understand important certified you’ve actually done physical work. assume it’s fairly similar medical field too?

My program would actually encourage people drop class issues doesn’t effect GPA get pro rated refund rest semester. Oh, anything magical. variants. Sadly, he's even getting slap wrist he's done last year. virus 0,1 % chance dying force us anything? me? I'm sure majority people already knew true cost lockdowns. mostly vocal minority (at time) media (also time, switch narratives) made opposite side (pro-lockdown) seem common actually was. tbh, seem like pathology. seems like reasonable emotional response actual crisis situation. course people feel bad! else supposed feel? Thank much.  Trying help wife’s family work full time juggling childcare assumed things things done grandma getting nitty gritty something I’m glad people like guys willing help people delve into. proof? really really really doubt 20% US it, would show mass testing. Cause mind government told us wear masks control us. Marshalls government employees need control wear masks..I really understand masks control people probably something related islam wearing hijabs... cause know racist gotta add bigotry onto also. I'm right least state live in. know many states (I'm pretty sure Texas similar attendance standards, dunno). I've seen teachers commenting states seem vary quite bit. Yes article says, China aging population. every person dies naturally age 80, least one person turning 80. Obviously variations given year, along evidence seems suspicious. Cause mind government told us wear masks control us. Marshalls government employees need control wear masks..I really understand masks control people probably something related islam wearing hijabs... cause know racist gotta add bigotry onto also. think people understand yet scale event: single person expels millions virus particles minutes, unimaginable amount virus multiplying body (billions, maybe trillions viruses), every single instances there's chance error produce new variants.

We're actually lucky virus seems ""stable"".

But face massive spread, chances increase favor virus. better country? big problem about. they're wearing masks. careful believe. cite ""depression"" reason get medical marijuana card PA. Might lot people kind thing. See, that's funny Yeah, except Covid, governments manage pandemic, uncertain everything is. Due covid, rest reasons good they're finally seeing bad consequences lockdowns, quite late it. Better late never, never forget. mask wearing sick becomes common, companies use excuse implement decent sick leave policies. tell people ""it fine come sick, wear mask"". Staying home sick much better wearing mask. Sure, get least four evening week spend things, you. Duties split evenly cool smoking tobacco pipe. One day might want live yurt, deal breaker able live one, really want partners work together help eachother out.... “Hotel employees, including front desk agent whose cousin U.S. marshal, found strange federal agents would take issue wearing mask, manager contacted authorities corroborate claims, according complaint. “ one would faulted UK done full in-house, nationalised vaccine explicitly British people, might sold rest world stocks permitted. 

The issue AZ private company appeared selling product around world like multinational pharmaceutical company. None EU plants producing exclusively country located, far know. everyone surprised announced vaccines made UK exclusively UK market. 

If AZ explicitly told EU UK would get priority treatment would changed EU's negotiating stance. contract filled vague stuff 'best efforts' obviously people annoyed. Ugh fine nothing extravagant. people don’t think exists. Depressed anxious due lockdowns long think it’ll till Osterholm’s fifteen minutes fame over?

Giving platform new administration’s biggest misstep. And, hopefully, time enter 2022, degree normality approximate kind normality used to.”

Not really sure claim quote context Fauci saying 2022 ""approximately kind normality used to""
  
Which total bullshit given fact whole reasons started restrictions protect risk overwhelm healthcare system. longer issue within couple months elderly currently getting vaccinated soon immunocompromised follow. Normal talked within month 2. restrictions. rollout makes sense. know medical coders day care workers fully vaccinated already (the day care worker I’m sure used connections parents) yet people need trouble getting appointments. OMG, laughed like bish... *happy sigh* like magically jumped day, ramping weeks leading up. teachers vaccinated prerequisite. know full well kids super spreaders. far im seeing whole lot different trump, rate F handling this, biden gets far. two either insanely wealthy lying Maybe cases ""negligible"" part restrictions? covid19

I would argue primarily lockdown Giorgio... you? Please stop talking one cares think guess I’m smart you! 
Please learn virus fake conspiracy control non government officials obviously law enforcement wear it. never take Republicans facts class?

/s obvious yes point poster every gene 50/50 parents. also cases segments chromosome inherited one parent, lead disorders inactivated copy (e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome). Epigenetic inheritance another example one parent disproportionate effect. hypocrisy EU would blocking orders, they're made EU make EU ordered vaccines. UK US invested far per capita EU setup exclusivity turf orders fulfilled whereas EU decided drag feet penny pinch already non profit vaccine. EU wanted exclusivity 1st door invested new factories. actually craziest part. even clear numbers decreasing. says 150000 names longer list. possible. certainly hope people cave agree live like 6 months every year. would miserable. Commiefornias response atrocious people keep defending it. 

The people bash Florida Florida fared better restrictions order change, leadership want change. Many businesses, CEO come even they're feeling sick show committed are. travels senior managers, middle-managers, finally line employees. sets corporate culture pushing illness, absurd.

My company...opposite. CEO directors decided set policy untracked STO. constantly tell managers ""tell employees stay home they're sick."" same. encourage people work remote something mild, otherwise expected online. account average amount sick days planning work.

Things never smoother. pandemic hit, years prior, stopped ""mini-pandemics"" always seem sweep office every year. real pandemic hit, already accustomed working remotely, literally stoppage work, things kept going, fine last year.

Companies refuse reasonable sick work-life balance policies deserve named shamed. Comparing immune system 99.9% chance beating virus vaccine emergency use approval. Doesn’t take Einstein calculate one. Funny flu numbers nosedived past year. Makes wonder flu deaths preventable practiced good hygiene social distancing along. I’m going wear masks one force wear pants. prefer freedom nothing bottom feel really bad university students currently. missing proper education best years lives. places treated like prisoners (see, e.g., Burrrr burrrr burrr! Keep going Mr. Vaccine Machine. mean 80% made up? math... Might 75% 70% exactly 80%, quick estimation... 12% population gotten vaccine far. agree that. Like said think owner worked move non customer facing role. everyone else works os vaccinated limit risks acting vector customers. 

But maybe try find solution work. 

Where I'm strict reasons fire someone think I'm looking lense.  Source paywalled. anyone simply link buy N95's? pack 100, KN95, N95 masks. Okay, generalities screw disabled folks time time (like society) that's ableist discrimination fucking wrong wear n95 surgical mask day, even one else building. see one coworkers, patients, husband chose even see parents holidays. exposed COVID boss, completely isolated two weeks. take illnesses seriously. 

In pre-COVID times, fever, actively vomiting, absolutely knocked bad cold course would stay home recover. turned car around realizing sick. also believe generally cannot isolate common cold symptoms arise reasonable judgement used decide safe work sick. mean covid go away Easter 2020? best friend pair beats high school missing school :/ Right? I’m “I don’t work, don’t get paid” camp. caught flu 2 years ago &amp; sick couldn’t get bed. missed 3 days work &amp; took us month recover financially. need functional immune systems  'I'm gettin' hair cut'

'Why get cut' soon Bars make Texas normal again? put sick days vacation days bucket call PTO. every time take sick day, use could otherwise vacation day. guy would make great piñata global stupid convention Interesting. always saw men body hair (more testosterone) seemed go bald men without body hair kept hair Yep. Men family maternal paternal sides keep hair - going gray early runs family. dad mostly silver 40 gray streaks start 25. agree. trusted. A+ Slow elective surgeries. receive industry reports work show one showing elective general practice appointments unless critical. It’s picking up. Psychologists mostly virtual now. Oh guy. Crap, I'm bad names. sound crazy thing harder science setting public expectation via bunch people solely rewarded exciting make next news cycle.

""Scientists say evidence suggest DEADLY new virus MATCH SUPERIOR SCIENCING!!!""

""Scientists WRONG!! Admit new evidence shows vaccine POWERLESS DEADLY virus!!!"" wish right “before 80%” number seemed made up. sad truth is, lot states (mine included) targeting people disabilities. fact, many states, people disabilities priority general population. California, aren’t opening vaccine eligibility people disabilities March 15 - three whole months vaccines approved. And, according Fauci, general population get vaccine April. So, California (a supposedly “progressive” state cares disabled), people disabilities get access vaccine weeks earlier general population.... Honest question: else parents going them? Old news Make pattern baldness caused excessive t-levels. Excessive testosterone actually converted estrogen. Male pattern baldness caused genetic factors inform production DHT, testosterone derivative. t-levels actually low over-producing DHT shrinks hair follicles, causing baldness. Yes, different everywhere. area, vaccinated county live work much show proof. Watch everyone, he’s claimed daily thread before, guy’s known anti-pantser!! wear mask you’re wearing pants?

Such fun troll!  simply bizarre see detractors AOC use power title initials. people isolated 17 days. mutates (already small chance) many times less likely spread anybody else country Sheer, utter arrogance (and money?)!

Excerpts: Peter Diamandis, also engineer, executive scientist, believed could create “immunity bubble” safely host scaled-down version pricey annual tech Instead, conference became superspreader event infected 24 people, including Diamandis, novel “I thought creating COVID ‘immunity bubble’ small group TV studio setting possible,” Diamandis, 59, wrote blog post last week. “I . Months earlier, A360’s parent company, Singularity University, canceled large in-person gathering. would-be attendees sick living isolation willing pay $30,000 inundated Diamandis team . Diamandis believed could create COVID-free zone polymerase chain reaction tests, considered many gold standard use genetic information detect Everyone required take PCR test 72 hours conference started Jan. 23, take another test arrived. second swab sent lab confirm . 25% attendance tested positive. audiovisual team, mostly isolated always wore masks, spared, Diamandis Masks mandatory attendees much “I allowed false (and dangerous) sense security based belief sequential PCR testing serves safety mechanism … tell fallacy,” Diamandis wrote.

And many folks 25% go infect? conference Boston beginning pandemic folks infected conference itself, snowballed thousands infected individuals. know it’s ideal I’ll take “only” million extra start That's good point. almost like certain countries invested vaccine production. Children like .0000001% chance dying. 

Anyone 65 0000001% dying covid. likely die car accident. 

We ban cars I'm thinking we’ve start. dealt pro lockdowners calling us names selfish etc etc. it’s almost 1 year anniversary lot us really cynical. mandate vaccine safety requirement, don’t understand point employment.

The point person consistently believe either employer right set rules government setting rules. case typically at-will proponents suddenly ""the government stop happening"". one other. I'm sorry, give shit. I'm typing but: Airplane metaphor. I’d think per capita figure would better metric. Raw numbers invariably skew favorably towards countries big populations.

The numbers US already exceed total population 24 countries world. I'm sorry happened comment cute. way is. young people strengthen immune system weak adults.  way exposure vax. People vulnerable try practice avoidance. small percentage population.  everyone practices avoidance whole population becomes vulnerable. I'm vaccinated really clear woman wrong? vaccine tested pregnant women effects known, CDC says wants get pregnant choice, employer's. Please link comments subs encourage brigading. Thanks. Seems like go-to strategy long term issues face Found guy thinks run business concern wellbeing employees. fact, think employee exist serve company. You’re completely right. And, add point, lot people comorbidities ones need frequent health care. example, you’re going chemo cancer, need go hospital frequently get tested / receive treatment. continuously puts risk. Furthermore, lot people comorbidities work earn living, putting risk. Contrast many people late 60s early 70s retired stay home day. think look glass.

I think studies showed sixfold reduction effectiveness.

BUT still plenty fight variant, vaccine effective first place. Hopium giving fuck anymore. handling pandemic destroyed chance successful run President. like @Vitamin_Plus_C said, Texas schools paid based student attendance. It’s weird system - local school board sets property tax rate people pay state local school district gets portion back based Average Daily Attendance. public school system TX funded. She’s actively trying get pregnant

She could put month fine. acceptable excuse. dad never let take sick days. thought insane. Please link comments subs encourage brigading. Thanks. get doesn’t actually violate subreddit rules? Look Northeast. Clearly holidays. course things super bad Midwest already holidays places like ND, SD death rates three times higher regions like mine peaks holidays. People's behaviors adapted death rates hospitalizations dropping mobility reacting this. issued mask mandates, etc... yeah, regional differences, plenty places clearly holiday spikes. Agree. old enough receiving vaccine week, would like see next tier ages 55-64 - free all. feel like vaccines going prevent death 100% severe cases 95%+ every variant year still seeing articles new Uzbeki strain shit may cause human die within next six months? can’t, however significant quantitative data thousands school functioning normally ( calendar wise) schools general “super spreader” sites. quantitative data shows public private schools “outbreak centers”? already getting warmer California? Seems like peak winter everywhere else. 

I think vaccines millions cases, people exposed developing kind sub-herd immunity. Health care workers, frontline workers, people take precautions must much higher infection rate average worker home. TL;DR: Covid around long time, perhaps forever. Vaccines right highly effective, updated futures. Even heard immunity never established likely life quite normal disease severity mild. Covid may end like common cold coronaviruses many masks last year China went trash last year? know hospitals trashed ton poor quality last spring. masks, medications manufactured overseas withheld.  Mitochondria powerhouse cell speeds

You know influenza mutates faster right? Good, keep 'em busy days make more. common cold lot grey area. without fever day probably go back work taking reasonable precautions getting coworker’s faces. would never encourage someone go work flu, actively vomiting, point barely get bed, etc. base decision doctor recommends particular occupation. inherit baldness either side. Ok, want talk anymore fine, but...

your quote:"" \~51% 14 days first dose 80% 28 days first dose (see Table 15 linked FDA/Moderna document below). ""

...is wrong. days (which includes 28 days after) 92%. Please see third row table reference. enduring fact pandemic he’s old won’t deal consequences younger people what’s matter him

Coincidentally Covid mitigation strategy. Oh Yeah, disagree role government. Perfect attendance elementary-limo ride Incredible Pizza 🍕for day. 
Perfect attendance high school - get opportunity win new Chevy Cobalt! 👍🏻🤧🎓🏆🚙 principals don’t even care. better missing limb fire come tardy. April 4, 2021? eligible, I'd bet started trying get signed get one least next month. I've trying get dad one since restaurant workers (he works school district) even eligible. Mandating make sense there's enough supplies. I'd bet fired expressed want get it. High altitude symptoms usually dizziness, nausea, sometimes headache. also potential Covid symptoms. Get tested. Sorry. I’m unable ban him. think factor 2020, schools basis ""miss day make come back"" high level class, puts behind, ton work. everything online miss day, home bit. think people freaking interpretation said. Biden specifically say ""we expect normalcy December"". specifically states ""we different situation."" two different things say.

By saying ""we different situation"" means ""I expect us return normalcy time within next year Christmas different."" send kids back school now? Seems risky point. read many area went back meals. cool. Y'all already shit once.

did learn nothing last time? Hmm vaccination makes sense all. considering much current restrictions make sense, knows lol Thanks. person makes hard people like life without getting sick simply take common courtesy stage f home sick! ever stayed home sick, mom said I'd clean whole house.  Among symptoms considered ""long covid"" things like fatigue, depression forms mental illness.

This time another epidemic, mental illnesses, due restrictions gloomy mood everywhere. 

There certainly cases around know post viral syndrome real thing ridiculously overstated. It’s mostly returning expats well may true. August contract mention ""Licence Agreement"" made Oxford AZ 17th May. However, know terms agreement, enough give priority UK. Pfizer came said ""I need one dose, Moderna needs two"", Pfizer would go-to them.

They sell half many doses, get near 100% market share. guys vote, drive, drink. adults. responsible adults, irresponsible adults. 

I remember reading woman NZ escaped quarantine crawling over, hole fence. 40s. boss caught COVID summer. told us, said choice whether get tested. office lady forgiven getting tested lives elderly people. coworker also opted get tested point declared ""afraid"" quickly lost job. No. New York approved vaccine day hours FDA approval. delays. [NY Pfizer much logic handle NPC. ... hoarding vaccines young low risk? 

Shit, man, state high risk can't even get due supply shortages. JJ easy scale store, distribute. difference outweights efficacy. EU? Yes. ancedotal experience says keeping Pfizer away COPD sufferers potentially vulnerable patients. live scary world acceptable people say stupid things like this...  Kids cleaner parents. always wash hands, avoid playing dirt never pick nose public /s

Kids basically germ powerhouses pick sickness 30 kids class would enough unless R_0 5. Maths education really needed. like fingerprint criminal. fingerprint can't harm alert police.

The protein capable anything, immunity recognise foreign body remmembers it. Expect illness, preload acetaminophen, need return directly work. you’ve covid second shot, like have, expect mild flulike symptoms. keep mind shot working I’m Texas. Legally kids allowed around 18 absences year, split two semesters. year 8 allowed 1st semester 9 or10 second. 3 absences, receive formal letter reminding us take legal action kids aren’t school. top that, “flex” schedule end year. student missed 7 less days ENTIRE school year, get two weeks early. Also, absences equal. Makes difference it’s excused, Unexcused, dr noted, 1 period day.. it’s full absence goes them. 

Half first semester school year virtual. Due problems attendance software/google classroom stuff many kids burned full semester 8 days within first month. daughter’s school issued chrome book wouldn’t stay connected bullshit program marked absent every day first week half... even though assignments time. amount arguing school got fix absences. threatened visit CPS. 

So say fuck it. feel kids need mental day, take it. We’ve taken 2 far semester. don’t even explain school anymore. notes, calls. send excuses don’t take account anyway. daughter marked absent gym class teacher refused fix error. called days trying talk attendance office find isn’t anyone working attendance office due covid.  went quarantine around thanksgiving never returned. School hasn’t replaced them. Like WTF? They're safe take vaccine, accept risks getting Covid-19 don't. going force people get flu shot every year well? Maybe straight eliminate second dose, follow UK's COVID strategy Let ask this: believe corporations exist make profit? lot people do. lot people people believe corporations care profit shareholders. tend agree sentiment.

Now, businesses care bottom line dollar, wouldn’t make economic sense business certain areas? would chose high-crime area corporate offices in, example? 

It’s race thing; it’s crime thing. You’re racist assuming crime committed blacks minorities. false equivalence fallacy right here.  It’s like saying don’t need anything vehicle emissions used put lead gasoline. prioritized, understanding situation. EU already made new orders Pfizer-Biontech Moderna, going rely AZ-Oxford. Japan currently almost finished building vaccine factory. UK already built 2 vaccines approved. UK place food product shortages? True. knowing could end useless, wouldn’t arguing favor prioritized. would looking contract figuring slowly back away it. submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ridiculous Website exist might double number vaccines available right now? expected send kids fever 38.4°C=101.1F school Switzerland. kid can't even walk straight line kind fever.  Haha, think people learnt pandemic? I'm curious Newsom walk back ridiculous thresholds tier system. bring work hole work overtime. proof offers significant relief? Omg!!! Get lives lab studies mRNA vaccines. Maybe convincing ground, thats South Africa. reference, similar ""early agreement"" EU [was early almost month later. agreement negotiated 4 EU countries, later handed everything EU. South Africa completely stop AZ vaccine distribution? high percentage country receives AZ vaccine, another wave infectious deadly variants protective measures relaxed. UK release August one, CNN found freedom information website. 

I imagine would signed contract May UK gave AZ £80m infrastructure production etc. give money contract. Due virus due lockdowns? know, thing (from co-sympathizer) working, coworker obsession never calling out. worked small room cubicles, right top other. 

One day 25 weeks pregnant (and complications hospital tests) showed sick work. asked leave. refused. asked boss make her. talked basically said says isn’t sick can’t force leave. HR said thing. fucking sick couldn’t stop coughing. literally got work done could barely speak wasn’t coughing. got work anyway exposed. 

2 days later woke sick. work week course got really sick. Ended antibiotics. used sick time pregnancy related issues beginning year. coworker also made lose week pay. Thankfully husband breadwinner id screwed.

I’m glad don’t work now. also don’t know efficacy vaccines SA variant. j&amp;j AZ actually trial it. Read full Pfizer article, including responses Pfizer it’s rebuffed. small sample size incorrect assumptions. 1 dose may offer great protection proven 93%. believe one day need single dose middle it, maximum protection prevent spread source that? Would interested read r.e. estimated total number cases to-date. glue mouth shut? English get? confirmed yet. People hate change. Great idea 100% though. Member, Merica. agree, hence said overall probably right. think likely reason Israel denser population, contagious UK variant much prevalent, lot community spread young people aren’t getting vaccinated yet. I’m also open idea people US gotten infected thus antibodies. I’m trying argue you. I’m trying promote discussion. contract exists, surely would UK's interest release one instead one signed August.

It could case exploratory talks concluded May, contract finalized actually signed August. way EU least, announcing contract signing later date, usually months later. forced go school unknowingly midst staph infection, sepsis simply unbelievable amount pain. told day get physically enough collapsed outside began convulse shit. eventually driven ambulance hospital, recovered full month plus. one could fathom went school, tried walk around like normal, let alone crying mess whole day. even think able move spine, let alone go school. rest year many absences school due sickness, fair, feel like I've earned it. Never ever ever school come health me. reckon earlier contract related funding initial doses, since [the government made statement announcing deal top researchers rapidly working find coronavirus vaccine benefit £84 million new government funding, Business Secretary Alok Sharma announced today (Sunday 17 means that, Oxford vaccine successful, AstraZeneca work make 30 million doses available September people UK, part agreement deliver 100 million doses total. know payment upon delivery? saga started people knew AZ efficiency newer variants. AZ also produces antibodies SA variant. understanding follows:

What fails stop infection happening. i.e. modified ACE2 receptor means virus still able enter cells antibodies attached elsewhere. antibodies still kill virus unable prevent sickness.

I'm pretty hopeful see minor (non-hospitalisation) sickness vaccinated people vaccine getting SA strain. EU UK needs vaccine mix get populations vaccinated within reasonable time. offers significant relief pandemic. lived half life connections it. 

I met intelligent people there. even agree potential problems AZ vaccine trying get Pfizer one instead. 

Anyway good luck! I'd rather protected old variants variants.

Yeah we'd like receive Pfizer Moderna shot, however short supply right now. give whatever available hopefully mRNA booster later on. incorrect pointed elsewhere thread. UK government contract back May, also pumped load cash development. also food product shortages. sword cuts directions. Germany gets approximately 18% EU delivery.

As said that's true. EU orders strictly distributed population share. countries actually order vaccines ordered much could every company. That's countries get less Moderna Pfizer others get need money. lectures UN do. need vaccines. would nice move, US starts sharing domestically produced vaccines least neighbors. Export 10% vaccines makes difference US, crucial Canada, Mexico World.

The UK. Even symbolic export AZ would good welcome.

EU must reports many vaccines produced vaccines sold. Otherwise, operations EU looks quite shady corrupted. UAE Israel prioritized? That's widely used southern hemisphere. South Africa even want work local variant. God help strain starts come dominant UK AZ booster shot ready. back square one. Long COVID, also known anxiety depression. thought r/jokes minute. That's absolutely true. incredibly defensive ""their* vaccine. said choice respected? can't work anymore. 3/4 deaths US come since beginning july. yes, beginning worst, nursing home deaths relatively small factor point explain disparity. know explanation seeking difference decline US israel. coming whole bunch reasons disagree obvious one, alternative explanation. plane put oxygen mask first assisting others. Yep. kids still school, basically went like this:

1. go school get exposed whatever respiratory infection rolls around.
2. get infected come home me. keep home they're sick. 
3. get sick spend next two weeks kind coughing fits feel like lungs collapsing also bring blood. 
4. go doctor prescribe antibiotics (for secondary infections original viral respiratory infection), make sure flovent, prescription strength decongestant, nasal spray, hardcore cough suppressant. 
5. Rinse repeat several times school year summer. 
6. Rinse repeat next school year. 

If think it, lot schools trying open back despite COVID. Think yeah, that's going go well. Strange people still arguing vaccine substantially less effective emerging variants. strep throat countless times kid. Know many I’ve since school? Zero. Yep. posted comment earlier pandemic think relevant time we’re 5 kindergarten get rewarded ice cream pizza parties “perfect attendance.” later, least high school, could opt final exams (basically) perfect attendance. sure still thing. God forbid sick one two times, need see doctor get braces tightened.  get work force.... you’re unfortunate enough work something like fast food retail it’s uncommon let go calling sick. Happened restaurant mono teenager. work office, even accepting employees taking sick time, undoubtably asshole patting back never calling sick X years job. guess? help dictator? what? Yes. Smokers protected class. countries exactly? European countries working way. Higher testosterone makes hair follicles thicken time leads hair loss.

Testosterone also helps covid attach cell. Yup.

The working class ones navigating new normal.

The rich noticed difference. 

So anyone expecting things change quickly go back 2019 was, well, since overly concerned rich powerful, left 2019 like, keeping working class thumb. Still done sons high-school Australia. Ridiculous. Rewarding kids attended sick. Unfair kids chronic health issues. Stay home sick. mean... ever countries? Good point. probably right big factor. Thanks... looking good uk want reopen borders Strange. 

My friends UK told many times enough pay lot(as UK) vaccination guaranteed. One could also ask give kids snow days school, adult get snow days responsibilities. think must initial contract dates etc promised production delivery funded UK government, [in may reported they'd signed contract UK announced they'd partner Oxford university. AstraZeneca, partnered University Oxford a leading COVID-19 vaccine candidate, already inked deal to supply millions doses to U.K. Now, the drugmaker is scouting partnerships make potential vaccine available U.K. “will first get access” vaccine successful, Sharma said a briefing. Under deal, AstraZeneca make 30 million doses available September. funny Lmao seriously, like person respiratory imaging technician? finding people? hear second dose terrifies you? Feeling bit sick sore arm? Like literally elicits pure terror you? finally understand. know US government producing vaccines themselves. impression vaccines US manufactured company also manufacturing EU.

Wouldn't make sense, company sell vaccines produced one country ones produced another, right? /s HIV. infect someone HIV. That's similar all. It’s definitely undervalued profession. that, generations likely become reality movie Idiocracy. original commenter trying pin unreasonable responsibility pandemic China's action alone. That's something agreed. Yes, china could stopped earlier, could nation prevented spread territories. 

China fair share faults, rest world: denialism pisspoor response covid-19 exclusive chinese - would argue even worst offenders. People file grievances enough pencils desk. Covid protocol CBA always least argument. minimum comp would use progressive discipline firing literally one year. That's long term. know wait that, right? totally agree. Trump bad, Biden good. Democrats good, Republicans bad. Canada forgot memo ""new normal"" happening people dangerous jobs. risk lives save others danger pay. join military fight country. same. understood us brave altruistic.  Yet somehow outliers always disabled people. OK, don't. What's big deal? contractually obligated PSAs something? Lol go it. Would love see goes. pregnant. ""unborn"" speak of. complicated. 

Everything comes play pandemics. Everything. Population density. Tourism. Age population. Even culture religion. well accuracy metrics. states never gave much damn testing... undercounted deaths lot. Florida one sadly. 

A lot extra ""pneumonia"" deaths Florida past year seems. 

Thankfully, California's data reasonably accurate. done almost 30% tests Florida per capita example. 

Thankfully, seems getting better almost everywhere. quickly Cali. Hope holds. OK vaccine distribution bidens fault states, unless Trump. Gotit Russia isn’t even American problem, it’s European one. 

Russia could conquer half Europe wouldn’t affect US all. 

Containing Russia important Europe US. please don’t threaten helping problem. JerseyMike2 always smarter one. Makes better sandwiches too. Potentially swapping hair loss man boobs, hmmmmm.... decisions, decisions..... Frankly risk vaccine trial *just* vaccine (which proven safe anyway), also placebo not. envy much people vaccinations trials. half vaccinated none supposed know got, applies even vaccines go commercial unless strong reason get vaccinated. Volunteers paid study sake science too, agree scientific purpose study, includes blinded placebo group staying placebo way get clean vaccine safety data 1–2 years.

Quite opposite. “Should people already received first dose vaccine second dose delayed number months greater supply.”

it's solitary confinement. 

it's supposed nice. kid’s school last year, too. Nothing virtual school idk in-person classes it. Hope not. 

My kid didn’t get sick also took DisneyWorld week grandparents. Yeah better wearing mask time lol. Neither EU. 

The EU sharing single vaccine purchased.

Vaccines manufactured EU bought countries never EU’s property, can’t share something never owned. 

Why many people struggle understand simple concept? China shut borders announced COVID-19 declared global pandemic.

And? China wuhan lockdown started 23 January, nobody else reacted.

 lockdown deemed necessary chinese people, need 'notification' shit's happening.

For real, wait chinese 'suggestion close flights', rest world can't fucking shit together? 

China faults, trying tie fate rest world failings China's responsibility asinine. ask podiatrist kid's headache? quite incentive. can't see reason go there, unless serious (but even then, need isolate 14 days urgency sort gone) misery cult subset revels lockdown, perpetually competing one another show much martyr are. could end quarantining 5 star beach front resort hotel, fully paid government destination wisely. Eating fucking words better part pandemic humbling depressing experience. one people thought would summer 2020. Ha. Ha ha. Cool. Smallpox, measles, mumps, polio... gone (vaccine induced) herd immunity. 

Covid flu virus.... don’t need suggest ban flights though. human human spread confirmed mid January that’s WHOs call. Fauci pushing low numbers US enter holiday season / winter, reduce height surge.

Beyond that, state wanted eliminate, summer would logical time - also basically appetite US (and would require state border closures manage anyway). read epidemiology statistics better one top experts subject UK. 

Goddamn, someone get White House line /s Oh yeah. think something similar happened phrase ""herd immunity"", too. do?  science support that?  

I would interested cite EUA that. Yep. sent kids daycare sick forced employer use PTO FMLA babies - unpaid FMLA option. came back PTO. earned one 8-hour period per month. allowed unpaid sick vacation time ever, ever take time anything (doctor’s appointments, illnesses, or, god forbid, vacation) I’d send kids daycare sick didn’t high fevers. ended quitting older child needed OT fiscal year I’d taken maternity leave second. FMLA exhausted didn’t leave time bring weekly appointments. UNIONIZED job minimum entry requirement master’s degree. 

So yes...until America makes substantial changes leave policies, people going work/school sick something find completely understandable.   school district asked could help ease fears going back school response was, ""Stop letting attendance lady call shame us keeping kids home runny nose."" Like, I'm sorry, yes, school important kid feels like crud know runny nose going lead symptoms I'm keeping home. Period. refusal puts staff members customers work. /fired early pandemic instead wiping groceries would run ozone machine trunk 20 minutes bringing inside. Glad wasn’t crazy “cut” “uncut?” One dose gives immunity, second dose booster. There’s good chance okay. you’re rich smart.  course. disagree you. replied precisely *don't* think study contradicts reports population-wise, young people labor force ones end transmitting covid most.

It looks like source confusion studies use word ""superspreader"" label describe types people expel viral particles air around them, things equal. People uh, biological SuperSpread-ability. silly word cobbled now, part interesting scientific question. Super Spreader interacts 5 people might infect 5, Normal Spreader (I guess??) interacts 5 others exact way could infect nobody, due biological factors. Maybe Subpar Spreaders too, never expel much virus, could literally spit fine, knows. people could Super Resistant, biological trait, behavioral one.

If superspreader (person high biological SuperSpread-ability) stays home infects one, they'd still superspreader biological definition. Similarly, someone allergy never experiences allergic reaction, allergy still there. define innate medical trait, label result action.

A superspreader (defined person high biological SuperSpread-ability) hardly ever leaves house could still resident nursing home dense communal living situation, end hospitalized potential infect many people there. use word make many sensationalized headline, biological component independent behavior, need know. /r/iamveryrichandsmart pretty much everything except type preliminary herd immunity? always last possible scenario

Because media screamed rooftops like 6 months ""impossible"" reach refused discuss nuance whatsoever. conversation someone Fall vaccines + partial herd immunity would lead cases dropping Spring completely shut ""herd immunity exist Covid."" yet...here are... First all, I've watched make inaccurate claim multiple times now. Teachers ""cut line."" governor made decision wishes teacher's union itself.

Secondly, I've also watched draw incorrect, fallacious analogy employees patrons K-12 students educators even though one group choice not.

One operating within context personal choice context legal mandate. continually conflate two difference, challenge someone pointing you, disservice argument demonstrates lack understanding dispute Brown teacher's union. ICUs pretty empty everywhere except South summer chart showing hospitalizations going incredible rate. Jan 9 130,781 hospitalizations, Feb 17 63,398.

Not sure understand I’m downvoted. FL sure would suprise anyone. open secret military folks exactly sharpest tools shed...  Describe what? shots? honestly didn’t get good look. seemed like shots regular syringes, hurt like hell. formed us line stuck right left different nurses. didn’t ask shots were, boot camp, don’t that, take it. God, remember “lockdown vaccine” doomiest doom could ever doom? Teachers go back school without vaccines. don’t want to. CDC confirms it’s pretty safe go back school. state allow anymore. note specify days absence, plus note must received within three days absence.

Which fascinating, miss week, three days expire bc weekend/kid can't wait attendance drop note/miss class.

Ended homebound schooling twice bc shit like that. Hahaha hey that’s me!

Sure beat poor uneducated basement boy. That's part it, there's definitely institutional factors play. example, Arizona opened vaccines seniors weeks ago. website translated Spanish yesterday. barrier vaccination, part reflected disparities. Yeah also kids get sick lot. usually missed 20+ days school per year, due sick. Luckily schools stupid attendance penalizing policy, would probably still finishing high school ten years later Far defend aspect U.S. military industrial complex, forfeited right practice skepticism upon enlistment. comparatively qualms human tests subjected to, taking vaccine theoretically aligns part job description serving others nearly much reticence.  body, choice. Make mandatory I'll go jail fight this.  would send potentially sick kid school infect others knowingly? guess colds always still exist season. I’ve gotten summer before, it’s way less likely fall winter.

I kind wonder though asymptomatic spread considerably common thought. It’s hard get real measure though haven’t tested large chunks population west... need it. Yeah. Upper right. Here's says:

 **Date** 08.12.2020 

You disagree this? realize even president since article posted? hate comments like “why people saying need stay home 2025???” like, people? serious stance anyone credible make sake arguing getting upset?  There’s nuance. course lockdowns cost think proponents lockdowns would acknowledge this. question nothing worse cost lockdown. situation looks completely different two months ago. Less death/cases/hospitilizarions way vaccinated/on pace vaccinated. costs lockdown may worth benefits. whole argument ever clearly people don’t believe worthwhile governors, media, regular people always going come around ending restrictions things got better they’re getting better. [3]

While implicitly acknowledging rollout vaccines developing countries diplomatic battle western countries currently losing, Macron said interest countries wanted borders remain open extend vaccination programmes beyond home territory. 

“It’s interest French Europeans. Today 10m fellow citizens families side Mediterranean,” said. 

Macron, whose government criticised slow rollout vaccinations France, insisted transferring “3-5 per cent vaccines stock Africa” would impact domestic inoculation programme. “It won’t delay single day given way use doses.” France promised vaccinations adults want end summer. 

Without helping neighbours around Mediterranean Middle East Balkans, European countries would never able reopen would end reimporting Covid-19 variants resistant vaccines, said.  [2]

Macron acknowledged EU slower US ensuring production supply vaccines populations facing shortages, said diverting small share doses Africa European supply chains would hinder vaccination campaigns.

“The key move quicker,” said. “We’re talking billions doses immediately, billions billions euros. It’s much rapidly allocating 4-5 per cent doses have. 

“It won’t change vaccination campaigns, country set aside small number doses transfer tens millions them, fast, people ground see happening.”

Macron said discussed idea “a lot” German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “She supports agreement,” said, calling “fully European co-operative initiative” adding hoped also convince US, vaccine supplies plentiful EU.

He said plan would test reality multilateralism. “It’s vaccine diplomacy, it’s power game — it’s matter public health,” Macron said, adding welcomed global provision Russian Chinese vaccines provided certified scientists use appropriate variants virus.

“It’s unacceptable vaccine exists reduce chances woman man according place happen live.” guy constantly spamming thread random things trying provoke reactions. [1]

French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe US urgently allocate 5 per cent current vaccine supplies developing countries Covid-19 vaccination campaigns scarcely begun China Russia offering fill gap. 

In exclusive interview Financial Times video link Elysée Palace, Macron said African nations sometimes buying western vaccines made AstraZeneca “astronomical prices” — two three times price paid EU — offered Chinese Russian vaccines uncertain efficacy new variants virus. 

“We allowing idea take hold hundreds millions vaccines given rich countries starting poor countries,” said ahead G7 meeting video link Friday leaders world’s biggest economies called UK prime minister Boris Johnson.

The French president said crucial pharmaceutical groups making vaccines transfer technology abroad order accelerate global production vaccines — “we apply pressure can” — transparent pricing. 

The concept intellectual property essential innovation, vaccine manufacturers co-operative “inevitably political question intellectual property arise countries,” said. “I don’t think it’s right debate, it’s helpful, arise — discussion excess profits based scarcity vaccine.”

“It’s unprecedented acceleration global inequality it’s politically unsustainable it’s paving way war influence vaccines,” Macron said. “You see Chinese strategy, Russian strategy too.” India provided 60% world's vaccines pre-covid, still GG. plan get vaccinated. job gave us links guided meditations “resources” plus “daily inspirations.” post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Mink shockingly exceptional intermediate host farms around Weifang Shandong 100,000 them. true raccoon dogs also transmit well give back humans. Bats roost disgusting farms carry pathogens back forth them. Fur $20 billion industry China; even since many countries wisely banned it. 24 January, 2020, China’s English-language Global Times said based GISAID data artificial intelligence software likely intermediate was... mink. could even original host. study pointing mink set Chinese Academy Sciences, Wuhan institute Virology Chinese CDC. team, led Quian Guo, highly respected, study well run, results contested.”

“In fact, focus Chinese mink, especially Shandong. recent months, learnt scientists mink catch virus humans infect back, often adding mutations process. beyond that, long history disease mink shows overcrowded intensive farming, solitary species — like farmed carnivores, unlike social herbivores —, sensitive many diseases becomes health nightmare. clear 3,000 mink farms China, 100,000 animals, could source current pandemic. therefore hard understand viral research conducted them.”

“In 2014, Shandong mink farms suffered outbreak pseudo-rabies originating pigs, led death 87% animals spread disease rest province. scientists trying evaluate extent outbreak 14 locations confirmed publication virus highly contagious region « it would challenge fur producing industry ».
In 2015, team including Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli isolated identified viruses bats closely linked human, pig mink viruses. suggests interspecific transmission exists bats humans animals.

In October 2016, team veterinarians Qingdao Animal Science Veterinary Medicine College discovered Shandong minks contaminated contagious avian flu H5N1.
In 2019, veterinarians college detected mink farms Shandong emergence deadly co-infection virus canine distemper H1N1 swine flu, became new strain H1N1 infected lungs mustelids.

Farmed minks also possible intermediary hosts type Influenza lead directly indirectly development human pandemic strains. sometimes host epidemic form type E Hepatitis virus unclear whether affect humans. Minks also monitored BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis) inclusion animal protein diets.

In order minimize damage, mink vaccinated viruses affect most, highly contagious parvovirus Aleutian disease, canine distemper. Minks fragile lungs. spontaneously catch lung infections, spread easily sneezing (as ferrets, also mustelid family). Mink, like ferrets, carry specific coronaviruses. ferret coronavirus called « systemic », attacks organs, mink’s virus called mink CoV (MCoV).

Bats, attracted fur farm buildings, frequently defecate caged animals
The fertile breeding ground viruses farms represent measured fact Chinese mink concentrated mainly Shandong. historic fur production region home thousands farms, different species often raised together. animal population totals, 15 million mink, 3 million raccoon dogs 6 million foxes. clustered relatively small area, extends towards south coastal town Weifang. animals live crowded together sometimes appallingly unhygienic situations, fed partially fresh fish coming Yellow Sea, pig offal, poultry giblets, animal bone meal carrion species. Large amounts animal protein important quality pelts. captive existence short : mink, example, reproduce March, give birth April litters killed mid-November mid-December. ones survive males females necessary produce next generation. reproductive animals account 12% population farm, enough pathogens persist.”

“Also important fact Shandong mid-mountainous forested region, known partly caves shelter many species bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, coronavirus carriers. bats attracted farm warehouses, provide easily accessible shelters. urinate defecate often beneath them, including cages housing animals.

So Shandong, areas China, ingredients exist powerful viral encounters, recombinations kinds, rapid emergence spread disease.

A little known fact 2019 Shandong produced 6.5 million mink pelts, nearly 15 million 2018. means nearly 9 million mink disappeared one year next, 55% drop production one province. sharp decline suggests form disaster. Could health problem ? production hides foxes (5,7 million) racooon dogs (3 million) remained perfectly stable. China Leather Industry Association, several requests information Reporterre, explained email «a stagnant market overproduction» led «many companies leaving industry». hardly enough explain dramatic drop output.”

The article long worth read. mountain substance compared practically real scientific data article. No, saying beginning distribute vaccines finish line. explicitly saying non pharmaceutical measures conjunction vaccines get this. people, like you, actually read articles, read headlines hit comments ferment outrage. 

Everyone, scientists, doctors, regular people, want end asap. trying help us get back normal quicker, telling us best way continue wear masks distance vaccine distributed variants ruin progress made. 

Imagine everyone handful dice. get vaccine take dice away you, get virus get vaccine roll hand dice. roll magic number, well fuck there's variant could evade vaccine. want reduce number people dice fast likelihood varient fucks us diminished. wear mask social distance us vaccinated rampant uncontrolled spread eliminated. Y'all ever notice people think overdramatic say social distancing killing grandmas also think Cuomo evil killing grandmas?

What's that? humans stay still 90 days. Already bought tickets March. Fun fact started pandemic working grocery store, worked much know time day really, week actually got enough sleep cognizant surroundings low behold started panic attacks like crazy manager without pay! 

When quit still living  parents threatened kick make homeless! I've also confirmed major Depressive Disorder Psychosis general Anxiety disorder! 

Ah, Narcissistic parents, gotta love'em

I hope everyone domestic issues parents better least decent trying thats could ask really. vaccine schedule pretty behind US honestly I'm shocked. likely dealing covid longer unless something changes. guess small, crowded apartments coupled least one person work high risk job order survive. redacted contracts UK EU compared practically identical. use ""best efforts"" language. ""export ban"" contract. describing plot movie really medical data got extra vaccine. That's way valuable Pfizer 18M doses. Mortality would 10x higher without lockdowns actually enough. reduction infections important part eradicate virus assuming resistant mutations. Taiwanese media source lot China conspiracy theories regarding Covid. can’t help feel I’m reading propaganda meant whenever read story either country. like life time stolen

Really? sure feels like did.  Weird, dont remember fox news jacking dems last years. Eh, Must’ve missed support imho I've never happier US. less restrictions Europe (even restrictive states) deaths per capita worse. seems strong public sentiment favor returning normalcy here. Also, done vaccinating months sooner Europe. comedian Oligarchs shitty children. work development mRNA , followed manufacturing, followed rollouts slow get ahead varients, back, cap hand, UK I'm not.

America went all-in vaccines, Europe went mitigation.

We're seeing results played out. Theyre totally selling vaccines side people supposed listen opinion based radio report heard point. even radio report incorrect match guy said. Got it. 1 3 adults also depressed, anxious, horny COVID  NZ even vaccinating yet barely. They've done well controlling waiting data. said ""lockdowns work people still gather inside anyways""

you said ""yea work leave house""

I said ""...yea exactly, may well keep businesses open then"" Covid, realization large portion people selfish Aholes care others? many people lose relationships family, friends, neighbors, etc toxic people care get sick 🤷‍♀️ literally bullshit headline ever seen.

""The study found vaccine still able neutralize virus yet evidence trials people variant reduces vaccine protection“ I'm you. entire company switching 3 days person/ 2 days remote. people need quiet time intricate/complex work, great. people need leech others, much. Lots incompetence exposed past year. What? talking article talking covid. Every time cases hand deaths gone hospitalisations ICU numbers reduce, open back up, that's fact.

What? comment know isn’t relevant thread topic discussed? Honest question. even dumber vaccines going hotspots deaths, countries poor countries. both? think both. 2 depressed they're adults I’m understanding correctly, Pfizer-biontech Moderna vaccines 90% protection one dose. huge. would likely drop transmission numbers It’s months I’m recovered. careful wish for. I’m locked struggling breath every day. Wait wait wait depression important now? Fuck needed pandemic happen taken seriously? think doubling Pfizer Moderna, orders, also made BioNTech break exclusivity Pfizer resulted new partnership Sanofi pharmaceuticals make BioNTech vaccine?

Are ordering vaccines AZ? No.

Just Pfizer Moderna reinforced 400 million doses.

Basically AZ turned unreliable, they're verge done. EU seems taking USA approach going full mRNA, leveraging facilities pharmaceuticals EU.

If see headlines EU pulling AZ contract surprise all, almost half billion Euros could placed reliable pharmaceutical companies.  anyone else amazed every single European government extending extending lockdowns instead coming actual plan ending them? problem let virus run wild countries time space evolve new variant could make existing vaccine bit useless like Oxford/AZ South Africa mutation.

It **global** pandemic. reviews also say company nonexistent customer service gotten products. sound like robot. Hospitals full, far it. Heck, metric lockdowns went amount hospitalizations amount cases hospitals overrun. Also, point take suicides, depression, poverty, homelessness etc. account? mean, end year people died hunger (predominantly young people) Covid-19 (predominantly old people) *direct* result draconian measures lockdowns worldwide. 

It's easy say making 'sacrifices' sit home, watch netflix collect paycheck. reasoning get people first dose significantly help mortality situation. obviously already? must really annoyed see there's still something bottle supposed throw away... read data, agree position. 

We could dramatically increase number people vaccinated, get transmission even lower everyone one dose time being.

Dragging longer necessary seem worth it.

Btw: changing policy. individual getting vaccinated right now, turn dose offered, assumption help. Sounds like good reason wait employer also good reason let go. Golden rule. gold, make rules Ignore NYT one anti UK rags there, drivel don’t know it’s 3 3. got COVID, ""recovered"", anxious trying get it. know people died others currently ICU. symptoms mixed bag terrifying.

Fuck thing man. already stated PTSD pandemic lingering years come. Many don’t another 20 years rebuild everything worked hard lost 6 months. Ik 40 year olds who’ve lost homes. can’t get back hustle whole house again. Shits it’s 10 years alone rebuild credit. mama wasn’t still living idk I’d hold together. indications affect effectiveness vaccine. know, I'm medical professional; I'm going clearly told. incentivize attendance many schools' funding based many student-days record. if, course entire school year, student misses week's worth days, school whole loses week's worth funding capitalism logic school get money students present? Sounds like someone trying justify boring life business still cannot operate, going year. PPP unemployment coming anywhere close covering gigantic income loss. Customers bugging tell events coming back, crystal ball and/or control permitting.

 business lot social life, adds depression. Eating feelings resulted 40 pound weight gain. Marriage complete dumpster fire husband prefers avoid basically anything doesn’t make completely comfortable poor listening observational skills, doesn’t know good partner told do. Maybe always way, it’s gotten glaringly obvious I’m emotionally drained.

Also, seasonal affective disorder gets every year, tack least another month.

I’m damn lucky nobody know got it, grateful helps keep individual experience perspective, doesn’t stop really depressed. Excellent article. Wonderful information highlight absolutely everyone absolutely everything avoid risk contracting and/or spreading covid. No, wouldn’t. risk long term effects isn’t worth it, case mild lasting effects months later ruining life.

Basically vaccines developed far struggling SA variant. It’s “wildly unfair” helps cover China’s virus origin scheme, perfectly overlooking virus lab Wuhan studying coronaviruses, saying could come another country. I’m much better world stinking sub, wait!

I pretty much OK election post-election drama piled mental limit exceeded I'm falling apart. force deliver EU order 50%.

You could used time educate instead pretend death preferable staying home pandemic. basically sucking tiny bit sterile bottle air needle, sucking liquid needle, giving shot way air left needle exactly purges dead volume needle? Congrats dude. 😁 think happens vials sent? No. not. 

I’ve told needing show id racist. yes, providers verifying people say show up, everyone needs provide necessary information making appointments. Foreigners prohibited registering appointment first place. Oh noes boring able educate myself. one example. There's lots do. guys chose complain instead. not. know use it. Yes lot doctors seeing less patients many elective procedures postponed. Good you? everyone chances work have. Lucky you, lived twenties 10 years ago got enjoy it. Lots nature walks, gaming. problem guys can't find good time waster enjoy. Reading books.

It really isnt issue manage pretending dead better utterly pathetic insult died. we're buying house right i'm double anxious/depressed thats great advice, isn’t easy deciding think it. anxiety, depression, trauma simple none us would suffering. I’m looking forward day bullshit doesn’t impact anymore. live California. point kind true lockdown. Everybody ignores restrictions consequences. wouldn’t even know there’s pandemic way people about. 

Versus China, welded people inside homes arrested anyone violating orders. true lockdown. think deaths usually like 1 2 weeks actually occurred, sometimes get even longer backlogs paperwork issues. seems average 1 2 weeks Indeed. big step, think people would judge us harshly moving together soon wedding!

 Lots lovely cheap land New Mexico it, job market bit rough though, really look remote gigs seeing popping up... yeah absolutely well stated. comment one provided source claimed reviewed data. put much confidence it. May be, right, bro. source Pfizer wanting change recommendation? Seems like company started shipping less vials EMA allowed 6 doses one istead 5 would cut proftis like that.  Alternatively, become nurse realize possible maternity ward normal ICU slammed hospitals large places full people different jobs. really. 10μg dose similar 30μg Lol clearly taking public school chose seen kids private I’m confused, public college old public middle school transitioned online classes pandemic. private high school stayed open, even supplemented online classes. mean “they’ve open whole time?” pandemic legacy elimination results favorable mutations allow virus cured easily next game. Well that’s good least. bothering kept acting baffled Oxford vaccine approved US yet, among places. kept waiting correct explain scientific reason approve vaccine provide proper trial data. seems like can't put biases aside.

I remember asking form teacher couldn’t even come response “means kids won’t skip school” two possible end games virus fizzled either infecting enough people stop spread mutating, vaccinations creating widespread immunity achieved goal. really two possible outcomes outcomes every past virus.

We produced vaccines incredibly fast virus spread unchecked parts world year. recent declines cases feel bubble bursting. well may reached level exposure immunity virus longer spread. ""Herd immunity"" on/off switch degree really know many people infected get sick. estimates 3-5x many cases say higher that? 50-60% people exposed virus done. I'm uk definitely food shortages yet! Ahh yes, depression, “get stuff done” illness.  ""Our Government"" make sense context. federal government, state government. Direct anger right idiots. pull word significantly from? everyone experiences bad symptoms, strong side effects seem common Moderna. feeling like garbage indicate working not. 


How feel first dose? AZ great high uptake country. ask whats better, 95% people getting AZ 75% people getting Pfizer. 

UK high uptake country benefit fast AZ rollout long term, uptake well whats expected. Imagine 90% population got flu vaccine every year? informed choice refuse vaccine cdc recommendation, intentionally make high risk getting pregnant. Mhmm. Smart lady. what? found data known bald people, grouped variables (essentially age BMI), compared rates positive COVID tests hospitalization. read ""study."" there. even mean ""they found baldness risk factor itself""? found correlation data. Correlation mean suddenly risk factor. is. known group people allows medical history compared quick dirty statistical analysis.

Well I'm definitely kids. place fucking nightmare. administration really look investigating J&amp;J far behind versus promises made. course it’s safe to. Western culture suck  say apparently rich country like Canada idea month.

When rest Europe start taking things serious regarding quarantine. one tired misinformation, nonsense, fear paranoia. People riding train crazy even know it.  wear masks, said enough masks!

He never said that. Pfizer Moderna producing vaccines state. get federal tax benefits, state tax benefits.

Ok, mandate people actively sick contagious illness targets old people old people homes despite able properly isolate them?

If it’s even comparable. Vaccine manufacturing lot spots get delayed getting started. happened hit few. Yes! kids high social anxiety kids. moved years back, started 1st 2nd grade new school. 2nd grader missed lots days anxiety and/or called school constantly feeling well.

Attendance important point, child managing workload well, concern. Even then, attendance guarantee good academic success. honest, since they've schooling home, wish could home school indefinitely. focus interesting things things need focus on, fast track stuff they're already strong with. understand, states holding half vaccine receive reserve second doses. I'm pretty sure stuff. It’s California.  Hmm. Kinda rude. Biden likes whole promise overperform thing. way things go wrong look bad, things go well looks even better. See: 100 mil vaccines 100 days plan, already completed month deadline Yeah here’s source shows labs across Canada running PCR tests range different cycle numbers, including 45. concluded lab tests roughly equivalent terms *lower* limit detection (releasing sensitivity), didn’t study specificity (aka tests’ probability positives true positives). study big reason everyone desperate things return “normal” even means poorer countries get screwed.

I guess time past stuck me, lesson took cells put unexpected situation evolution prepare for, may unexpected things. thought stems engineered adenovirus enters nucleus triggers whatever set responses normally sets off....but engineered virus veers script refusing replicate, can't help wonder cell freeze bacteria did, unable move forward backward viral response program activated left waiting necessary viral cue never come. wonder try co-opt cells' natural responses using unnatural cues, eventually find example cells 'computationally stupid'. could simple thing, smart thing, changed script instructions written event.

Indeed, finally made factually correct statement. 

It mostly kill majority population, highly transmissible react strongly.

Can get source this? one dose Pfizer really gives kinda response think makes sense seeing cases trending places good news stories keep coming out, difficult keep ruining lives economies ""lockdowns"" never end. Cringe. thing is, actions need taken address CURRENT variant, AZ vaccine effective against. 

Pfizer stock limited.

Therefore instead allowing current variant running rampant next months wait Pfizer stock updated vaccine, choose address variant have. 

If people choose ignore current threat focus 'WHAT IF' next months, kudos them; I'm change mind. like plane dropping sky wonder food island happen landed on.

There reasons keep monitoring SA variant closely - threat mentioned. ways deal future problem; insistence ignore current problem sake future proof nonsense me. 

As said though, send back they're useless. yet find anti-AZ vaccine happy propose actions. son got certificate perfect attendance Q2 yesterday 🤪


Though, miss week school covid isolation counted apparently. Yeah, really misleading title position Pfizer. 9th grade strep lot 3rd time missed 10 days school (with excused absences). Administration literally told come school would held back year even tho doctor's excuse came school active strep. Anyone half brain knows ridiculously dangerous send children/young adults school pandemic. dress reasoning anything economy getting parents back work frankly insult. Thanks explanation.

I've taken look Nedlands, Crawley Shenton Park google maps detached housing, really built close together. road layout indeed ridiculous, seems houses surrounded roads sides.

But want turn apartments, much space gained there...

Even much bigger cities like Tokyo type ""detached houses"" almost dense row houses close people actually working CBD, really problem live 50kms away?
They could build satellite offices coworking spaces? currently live little 50kms away nearest CBD sometimes take train (45mins) mostly work home another office near me, seems working fine.

When new districts built needs ample public transportation, healthy mix zoning. guess suburbs ""bedroom communities"" causing traffic problems requires highways.

I get gentrification pushing prices neighborhoods nowadays seems less demand apartments see redeveloping would change much. Maybe, good planning, 30% homes crammed in? really going change much?

And yeah suburban sprawl horrible way real antidote apartment buildings demand that.

With popularity home working arrival self driving cars near future seems endless suburbia way forward country enough space...

A place like eastern China limited space, high-rise apartments abundant public transportation much efficient fact sustainable good luck convincing Australians live closer together. reason Chinese people moving Australia get living space :-)

In Europe also notice people without children like living mid-rise apartments city people aspire detached house garden point lives. space it, mid-rise apartments built :-) how's supposed work hourly workers can't work home? saying basically thing USA national roll out, things really caught done much better Biden. bet J&amp;J. holy shit article atrocious, bunch anecdotes least one someone contracting virus soon vaccine could taken effect gf's company tried keep in, despite taken test.

SAF variant becomes dominant months population protected think are. expectancy United States dropped staggering one year first half 2020 coronavirus pandemic caused first wave deaths, health officials reporting. health experts say shows profound impact COVID-19, deaths directly due infection also heart disease, cancer conditions. They’re likely frontline, low-wage jobs living crowded environments it’s easier virus spread, “there stark, pre-existing health disparities conditions” raise risk dying COVID-19, said. So, 2 guys better wear fake badges, lie, commit crime lying, threaten people, bogus medical exemption cards printed (and laminated!) wear mask asked to. People amazing.

Today, 62 days since tested positive, still suffer crippling headaches unlike anything I've experienced before. I'm 38 years old physically crippled two months.

This certainly anxiety. aware vaccine stop infected coronavirus spreading it. reduces body's reaction virus. still washing hands, wearing mask social Go read phase 3 results yourself. vaccine keeps hospital there's proof apply variants.

but maybe think ICU remdesivir better options.. declines happening world wide, midst peak flu season. Odd unaware this.  read Arktek. sounds like costs $2000/device used roll vaccine 300k people two years. heroic, rate, still think makes sense rollout J&amp;J vs sending hundred thousand doses Pfizer administer slowly continent. idea even optional. Like flu strain? would easy tweaked, hoping universal coronavirus vaccine someday. That's argument here. argument whether ethical practical delay second dose. ethical approve JJ vaccine all, ethical approve delay second dose mRNA versions. Seriously, take day two sick take vacation? vaccine prevent spread. reduces body's reaction virus. one goal mind: produce quickly many vaccines possible new virus variants Europe. wants avert great medical challenges 'do whatever takes'

How mindset starting June 2020 completely beyond me. Today, 62 days tested positive, still crippling headache dizziness unlike anything I've ever experienced before.
This certainly anxiety depression. Yeah, issues UK variant. weeks battle vaccination campaign variant spread, vaccines finally winning couple weeks ago.

It crazy watching numbers increase even 25% country got 1st dose. know that. live there, still open. Indeed, vaccine work UK variant probably would shitting pants make alternative plan too.

Like common sense reasonable course action score people anti vaccine whatever reasons. 

We're going change mind efficacy vaccine, write leaders ask ship vaccine elsewhere. 

Thanks concern precious little island though. Ebola vaccine it...

So yes. countries without necessary infrastructure UN WHO, WFP, agencies funds step provide infrastructure extent can. This. Absolutely this. accords everything know cell biology immunology. admittedly much people designed vaccine, regulatory bodies--but hands tied regulation litigation.

Everything done terms pandemic best-effort basis. vaccine approval provisional point. seems odd suddenly insist exact three-week schedule, much public utility six-week schedule. logic permits EUA could readily permit three-week extension second dose.

If question, ask people booking appointments: volunteer delay second dose someone else get one earlier (like husband brother, instance)? Sign release. Lol alright good day. People definitely need get word vaccine takes weeks become effective. Lots people saying going parties day getting vaccinated. flu vaccine similarly takes weeks become effective. also disingenuous act like shot dark, rather based available data strong precedent basically every vaccine created previously critics accused officials sending mixed messages head Sweden’s public health authority caught twice without mask public transport **while municipalities banned certain employees teachers wearing them**.

We need data tell us someone symptomatic virus POSSIBLE infect others. 

I think confusing data likelihood possibility. 

It 100% possibility vaccinated still spread virus. believe debate that. can't help scientic answer social standpoint area masks recommended enforced (anywhere can't physically distance, indoors, public transit, ie.) would still wear mask. region (Canada) antimaskers say anything wear mask. put retailers, clerks, anyone works public (including customers places) risk infection also make uncomfortable. Even though vaccinated, many people status quo socially acceptable practice still wear mask. life!!! fucking loved school loved quote statistics attendance critical grades, made policy drop letter grade absent, even tests homework completed. Self fulfilling prophesy. true states districts. That's right. well versed medicine Ebola basically terms temperature handling. infrastructure know that. Yeah, give school money, teacher gets cheaper teaches 29 students instead 30. Also giving sick student summaries day's work thing.

/s never proven. going bald, asked doctor said it’s bullshit. 

“Why would one genetic trait passed mother’s side, every trait 50/50 shot?”

It also makes sense mom’s side filled men hair, started losing hair exact age father did. reddit thing. Oxford/AZ got **a lot** bad press:
1. botched trials
2. little data old people (see 1.), many countries giving 65+/55+
3. less efficacy mRNA
4. possibly low efficacy SA variant
5. bigger interval doses (means wait longer ""fully vaccinated"")
6. Hospitals France, Sweden Germany ran problems **42%** staff called sick first dose. regions temporarily halted administering AZ.
7. ppl cancelling AZ appointments demanding BioNTech, come argue get BioNTech given AZ

Saying ""EU disinformation campaign"" borderline conspiracy theory. EU supposed do? Censor free press reporting?

There *are* voices. Officials experts trying convince people get AZ think reduces hospitalizations death difficult convince ppl bad press. Again, confirm scientifically proven. course chances something likely happen, speak something like it’s fact confirmed spreads fake information. need data actual scientists. Chinese bot? Nah open everything up, fuck talking about. can't agree more. Still is. Back 2017 high school, recall someone got ‘award’ never missing day class K-12 I’m talking I’m saying risks outweigh benefits society safety nets people’s health Yeah don’t disagree prioritizing given role children mingling children schools, source spread needs stemmed vaccinating kids important consideration want achieve low transmission rate. Also kids seem severely affected given complications injuries organs lifelong, I’m less comfortable dismissing young kids safe even contract it. Society wouldn’t function everyone something genuinely loved Colds often last weeks. Staying home weeks small sniffle overkill.

Anyone loves snow happy. totals 36 inches 3 weeks Chicago. foot day. personally want more. nothing amazing winter :D Go get some! Ah okay punish woman wants body time complying CDC guidelines? 

Good know. send sick adults work? Everything I've read suggests natural immunity still confers least protection variants. That's cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc. also falling places variants prevalent (like UK South Africa). world full bacteria viruses. never hide them. robust immune system exposure early years likelihood missing work common colds greatly reduced. case you’re conflating bipolar disorder narcissism, please don’t. angry narcissistic person nearly thing bipolar disorder. also idea you’d think vaccine would affect mental health like that? Super weird conclusion make offered get vaccine job. next seem like problem federal government CDC. issue guidelines instead? Haha jbchi content shit /r/chicago, comes /r/coronavirus vent grievances OVERALL entire month 80.2%. Yes, obviously fare better exposed COVID second half month first dose (no surprise there). Several vaccines less year... bungled? fuck sort world live in? really could REALISTICALLY better.

I’m sure you’re trying counter claim something supports it. Ya know good fetuses?

COVID. think states enough vaccines get 1a. ""service industry"" (as reason told someone asked) friends got to. so...that's cool....or something. obvious conclusion since inactivated virus rely spike protein 100% protection. China shut whole country end January pushed open foreign travel till end March. Chinese authorities limited domestic flights Wuhan Chinese cities like Beijing Shanghai effort contain outbreak January, urged international carriers maintain flying schedules. That’s unacceptable I’m sorry. question earlier. looks like probably states recent weeks begun using limited number retail pharmacies give vaccine doses, federal program launching next week cut doses allocated states — time, greatly expand number sites eligible people get Oh Kevin durant Yea, would make sense go descending age instead job. Well wish best hope things turn around you. Without knowing field, lot things learn self-taught say Udemy there's actually lot demand, especially creative fields. degree literally anything help specialize. currently unemployed anyway, might want think adding skills relatively easy quite cheap learn (it hurt resume regardless, might open major opportunities minimal time commitment). all. Everyone mitochondrial DNA, passed mother. certain kinds mitochondrial DNA appear show risk factor severe Covid. implication someone mothers family severe reaction, likely also. I'd gladly trade spaces you. There's lot people making argument prioritize adults developing countries spend doses lower risk young people.

I'm hoping make enough choose. black woman, would response? literally answered question. instills value working illness seen weird positive American society. comorbidities bigger risk factors age? I've read, age seems biggest one far. articles? isn’t science showing teachers higher risk. None.

Worth noting daycares never closed, apocalypse didn’t happen. little kids worse social distancing big ones

What’s difference? Unions Yeah school district work basically hinted least first semester probably going anything, masks form social distancing, still offering online learning outside person said it'll hybrid schedule.  heard first 100 times. people stay fuck home thanks. Why? high risk medical condition? bartenders given special priority Kansas? I've gotten doses Moderna. first dose sore arm 2 days. second dose woke 3am chills, moderate body aches, fatigue headache couple days. enough make call sick work, sickest I've ever felt. Well sounds dangerous. Lab studies suggested hydroxycholorquine would magic bullet. Let's see something vivo saying problem solved already. I’m wondering young vaccines administered eventually.  60Million kids 16 US. big chunk must age 12. I’d think school aged kids preschool 12 need considered they’re pretty big disease vectors transmissible diseases. makes fucking sense consider much current restrictions make sense I’m scared you’ll right Maybe put getting pregnant couple months opposed risking contributing pandemic killed almost half million people US? could snowstorms going on, people checking hospital even normally would?

of course going slow eventually, might snowstorm  people believe covid hoax mild flu sleep 2 days feel like new well pandemic joke.

Because people feel important receive education concerned childs health feel joke.

People still think covid joke believe covid deaths regular expected deaths another virus bacteria regularly cruises.

Humanity ready next step ladder evolution.

PS: subjective thinking typed here. literally objective sum peoples opinions online read IRL. necessarily. many people questioning legal fire somebody taking vaccine emergency use authorized. 

Also she’s following CDC’s recommendations trying get pregnant. Could spicy discrimination claim top that.  gave statistic symptoms 57% people surveyed said bed-ridden least one day. 

Who ""they?"" I'm PA one find appointment. constantly full, across state. People drive 4 hours get shots. even open teachers yet, high risk medical status. potential super spreader epicenters. 

Like said, research (that I’ve seen) school transmission support claim here. something contrary, please share.

[Here’s one would even demoralized lived :/ Literally everyone x chromosome... what? Side effects Pfizer Moderna second dose fairly common. chills, fatigue headache couple days. definitely smartest try stagger second dose 3-5 days. Fortunately fuck way better dudes, there's that. High five Smoking Virginia, could registered county January 14th. register statewide site, everyone registered county ahead you. went school, got degree career field studied me. Left another job okay beginning started drag me. want take additional debt go back school. Goal pay bills hope retire 40 50 years. Yeah small apartment medium sized office. Medify makes awesome units, four ma-14 two ma-25. filters get scarce sometimes I've always able get them. Smaller units might cost like $300 6 months including unit filters. ma-14 clean 200 square feet air every 30 minutes. ma-25 literally blasts medical grade hepa filtered air room rapidly enough clean 500 square feet air 30 minutes. That's favs, want ozone blasters stuff, really great filters there's variety depending application.

You rapidly mechanically pull bad shit air, capture filters throw trash! Highly recommend. they’ve YEAR figure out. There’s excuse UK’s incompetence.

And brought countries implied common thread them. quite explicitly stated there’s 1000 differences countries could explain different outcomes. don’t think right policies first place don’t think right policies now. seems like we’ve decided double restrictions pretty obviously effective, great cost :( honestly sad

I count among people lockdowns since like, May last year, really demoralized point Sounds like they're planning go back in-person classes. around 30 gremlins don’t wash hands frequently isn’t putting higher risk? superspreaders amongst first groups vaccinated (for example superspreaders predominantly older) could explain precipitous drop cases everywhere, once. could it? think Atlantic’s coverage really good. allows employers reasonably ask sick feeling well, put thermometer gun forehead. They're free ask questions, hard genetic proof vaccination, either healthcare provider never necessary mandated retail/restaurant/at-will employment setting. predictable. People wearing thinking good, numbers explode Republicans say ""masks work!"" Covid low here, it’s like let us Clearly you’ve never seen online classroom. There’s lot missed. Clots blood, messes balls, fucks nervous system, straight deepthroats lungs... Nothing literal yeah messes fuck ton things. feeling apologize including every piece information history inside post.

That’s led much higher admin costs university k-12. education resources become monopolized books expensive, etc. actually posts recently talking teacher funding recent comments want details. states better others.

Yep. 

Case point: ""Antibodies disappear 3 months."" media really latched onto one. People see think means immune 3 months, reality, antibodies wane infection immunization. That's immune system works! need actively cranking high titers antibodies immune. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Ha! Always ugly ones don’t want cover face 🤣 Yes, response pretty sad. Inconceivable! Kids go school parents go work. I'm surprised virus government response made apparent everyone.

Even Canada talking need get everyone back work first step reopening schools. think soon people realize lot people government see school daycare parents work, lot decisions make seem make sense. Lol. thought something guy. know quite people work healthcare including couple doctors, none espouse views opposed Republican yes men pretended exist almost year tired hearing news stories terrible vaccine rollout US ""struggling"" etc. rollout amazing continues amazing. increase vaccine volume various ways happening hope enough send countries. Around world. knew kid high school perfect attendance... since KINDERGARTEN! Yeah people complain sub probably exception Ca residents social restrictions government restrictions. Like 60-70 percent normal things right NJ lot people’s friends families still don’t feel comfortable going out. Asking questions experts opinions factual statements perfectly fine. means you’re critically thinking affect everyone else. consensus opinion “this vaccine fine serious side effects mechanism behind simply can’t harm us aside taking little sickness day” I’ll take word it. know better do.

Sorry seem trusting experts taste, that’s literally they’re for. aren’t toying us trying harm humans. know risks benefits much deeper level understanding either us ever achieve. serious doubt safety vaccine, wouldn’t administered. That’s process works. It’s insanely regulated.

Sometimes it’s data long term studies, sometimes understand mechanisms based decades research ahead time. mRNA vaccines brought fruition. said - everybody noticeable reaction.

Another vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech, example - coworker recently got vaccinated COVID, said read possible side-effects bought analgesics fever drugs beforehand case, experienced nothing. way around, crazies careless going around getting covid, children. covid messes testes tissue adult males, would issues boys getting covid puberty? knows see. 

So least group may affected fertility problems reproduction rate may decrease. see evolutionary win. Exactly. know US Marshals' retirement got better that. amazing like popping bubble. No...

USA, EU, already made change go 6 doses/vial instead 5.  definitely giving lesser dose.  6 doses vialbut need specific syringes order consistently draw 6 doses normal syringes waste much use. 

The Researches base claim NEJM study found first dose gave 90%+ protection 14-20 days.  52% protection number include time first shot including first two weeks provides little protection. 130 countries make vaccine want wait available them. Oh really, heard that. know Manaus really rough time. It’s even better. news station reported commissioner organized Manatee county put name list along four people personal circle, people even lived two zip codes. 

The corruption nakedly display Florida. article says able make 10M doses Sputnik per year. 

With population 85M take 8 years vaccinate themselves, let alone become top vaccine exporter region! genuinely sorry wish best. currently 26 degrees freezing rain DC metro area even cancelled online schools... course makes sense. roads like one big ice rink.

These reasons I'm struggling anxiety probably depression right now. I've removed many people life time being, stays you.

They stopped hit high school. freshman 2008. Yeah, money study well spent No, *first two paragraphs* patient needed ECMO. rest rationing care. Someone claiming something 100% true time regardless anything every state saying absolutely true providing source... Makes doubt pretty hard.

""Believe me"". No, think will. Man called one... J&amp;J vaccine Trump vaccines. Conservatives, vaccine line... get mine! One glaring “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.

Wow wow wow. Yep like, team started game 0 points ended game 24 points scored average 12 points.

I saying while. people never think hard viruses vaccines. get shots kids go lives. Nobody stresses fact flu vaccine 39% effective 50% people take it.

And media bad laypeople... guess media really laypeople. see concept data interpret grab random points make good headlines. turn misinforms public. Unsure getting downvoted.

I get kids kids, still active pandemic despite recent improvements. students actively giving negligible f*cks well-being anyone around them.

It's like bunch kids getting drunk hidden parties driving home. expect expelled. able refuse vaccine military? people immunized prior deploying countries, right? refuse vaccines? China literally single digit case numbers mostly free live lives majority pandemic. national healthcare. economy fine. Culturally mental illness taboo topic. America 6 digit DEATHS, 10s millions cases, mass unemployment, economic ruin, healthcare, political unrest, majority country locked inside fucking homes 11 months. fact numbers much lower China come surprise literally one. people lives unaffected, ones less likely talk it.

Please, I'm sincerely begging you, take statistics class read book acting smug internet. Yeah exactly. I’d rather covid lockdowns.... it’s really sad Bon jour. Imagine living -as business- oppressive communist dictatorship would force punish workers sick. I'm glad born S-Corp rights, freedoms punish workers.  Wait... you’re kids random high temperatures?!?! young child got slight fever, ongoing pulmonary issues, felling ill. Communicated mother several times kept school next day got Covid test (negative). Two weeks later wife written rant complaining communicating health needs said FAKED sickness one saw high temp feeling ill. guess call you...

""here's award lucky getting sick"" 

k. Yeah it’s called preconditioning adult hood. Seems unlikely I’m actually surprised it’s higher number. I’m one adults. I’m dark place, feels like there’s end sight. There’s nothing hopeful about. 2021 far basically 2020 2.0. see articles everyone depressed people suffering, what’s solution? There’s long long list problems different groups people majorly affected pandemic, government doesn’t care one seems offer solution make better already. China India Russia repeated months efficient, safe cheap vaccine fake dangerous, based pure gossip ""but Putin take yet!"" purely come famous western lab? employer force get experimental even old established vaccine. certainly (and allowed to) end association want vaccine (or reason matter). entitled force others associate you. So? never said relation pandemic. true police still needed interim. 


If people getting attacked broad day light police presence perfectly reasonable request. Remote working year now. Personally done studies, everything remote year counting. pretty common situation young single adults far seen peers.

We mostly ignored told hang there, risk category ""kids"" anymore, school situation priority. true! yet it’s still, non-linked form, told site removed lol course see good news, accidentally round decimals Cases dropping every state US almost every country worldwide even vaccines distributed. shit. I'm sick able anything. I'll probably reschedule honeymoon next year too. mean we’re still 2700 day we’ve seen Israel death lagging indicator takes several weeks vaccinate vulnerable population it’s definitely possible. vindictive side really wants kids punished expelled. parties among top causes COVID spread, they're selfish hell.

On hand basic human nature - we're asking juveniles responsible year, avoid enjoying youth.

It's hard situation even judge, let alone manage. guess heavy fines strike good balance. 

Though course undergrads getting expelled COVID partied get news more, I'd utterly fine it. Brazilian strain? ever hear news it?

The second school policy. graduated high school last year policy got three absences without doctor's note per *school year*. One cold done- forget mental health days anything else. think idea was, well, sick enough stay home, sick enough go doctor- convenient if, again, work lot times really wasted time. good kid made good grades, yet marked truant two semesters high school dared two colds. Sue me. 

I know there's underlying reasons behind school policies honestly, even funding issue excuse them. think get sick kids go school even need funding. Fuck them. understand ""controlling variables"" means? control age, find common link people remaining. higher expected population, risk factor. Um, no.

That's great cases going down, knowing important.

Nerdy math humor win! trying hate help her? got older relatives appointments pretty easily effort. way could done own. 

Even 65 year plus getting appts pretty easily. Keep dirty Mericans here!! It’s magic shield it’s best precaution take besides vaccination itself. better suggestion I’m ears. Good. Anytime tried bring ounce nuance conversation lockdowns called murder. Excuse trying look sides dice ruining millions lives.

This going sound heartless people we're trying save even around 5 years. I'll (hopefully) still around 5 years I'll likely still dealing aftermath bullshit. fair?  Lol course would given props agreed said remaining portion salary donated covid relief.

Instead, guess proves posturing. much worse article says. herd immunity work, every group people live work go school together sufficiently immunized. entire elementary schools full unvaccinated kids, entire summer camps full unvaccinated kids, matter adults vaccinated, virus spread quite easily. 

We either decide safe enough kids, get vaccinated, fact FDA following business usual part problem. really need accelerate testing younger people. train work important anything else world prepared job death. Looks like ~50% immunity first dose initially reported result including data immunity took full Polack et al. (Dec. 31)1 report vaccine efficacy 94.8% Covid-19 two doses messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech). authors also report vaccine efficacy 52.4% first dose second dose, calculation, included data collected first 2 weeks first dose, immunity would still Um yess, clearly think woman right control body life. allowed 1000 vaccines shipped, ordered 2000.

New data came effectively ends argument case Pfizer vaccine. One dose nearly good two (93% protection 2 situation Astrazeneca still unclear, delaying second dose Pfizer seems clear right choice. case, meager increase efficacy second dose outweighed literally double amount Pfizer vaccine available. I've wondered myself. remember kids getting perfect attendance awards. grew poor; times school literally money food. sick mother smoked house. like attendance awards awarded perfect people never got sick. care ventilation important safety measures. all. 

The kids go school, workers go work, cares anything else long enough live keep whole creaking ship floating. people going try drag things longer necessary (or bearable), eventually pressure great normalcy return fully. think happen sometime 2nd half year, 2022 2023. I've pointing decade. earth would ""reward"" parents send children school sick? (Because lasts face it, grade school kids go school even feel well parents encourage it). always terrible thing ""reward"". 

Funny many people go along schools expense health children. Perfect Attendance award one harmful practices put forth public schools. course not. isolated widow year. spunky, sharp, barely human contact past year. won’t around forever vibrant now.  done everything mean everything right book past year.  told visit website fight 1 million people get appointment. 

At point one thing know vaccines protect hospitalization death vulnerable populations.  One thing hope don’t know sure mitigate spread (I think find do). Cause Feds thugs criminals kids fake sick get school unless attendance requirement hardly show up. fake 9 10 get 10th need really sick what...you can't tell one way other. applies people jobs carries responsible maintain certain attendance policy hope parents teach kids properly. 25% infected.

They didn’t quarantine relied testing, Based 2 infections massive confidence interval... think anything changing soon Oh another side effect scare people MILLIONS restaurant employees country threw bus last March touching carry-out food year so...definitely vaccinate people dead last.  Similar people go work sick USA. sixfold correction amount antibodies produced. already produces like 100x antibodies needed fight virus. sixfold reduction much problem. Nice need vaccines per day. dysfunctional country like US get past 2 million day India even that. need get number chance vaccinationing enough ppl year reduce risk, they're magic bulletproof shield.

That’s i’m scared lol Imagine childhood didn’t watch price right daytime soaps blanket soup!? hate them. love friends much there's specific group wants Zoom watch livestream another friend used host piano singalong, delays always comes awkward. annoying fun. Worth noting data far whether vaccine reduces risk *others* still minimal. far evidence seems suggest vaccines producing sterilizing immunity (i.e., still get infected, particularly symptomatically. open question whether pass infection along others).  think worth least data businesses insist employees take vaccine safety customers. Guilty. missed total three days grades 5th-12th grades. showed sick many times due fact missed school couldn’t attend sport practice cheerleader bunch different stunts didn’t show threw everybody day. Moderna? I'm really unclear one better, seems like efficacy vaccine enumerated differently makes hard compare. days home alone ""sick"" around 10 greatest ever. 

I spaced enough could get away it.  like would adult jobs later. thing. Pretending thing lying yourself.

Actually, know what, sure. something happened past, \*has\* comparable. otherwise learning past.

Therefore, fully open summer 2019 zero covid cases. Summer reopening confirmed safe, using past example. need account new information makes present different past.  even vaccines (way early that)

Maybe so. There's talk high efficacy following single dose Pfizer (93% 2 weeks)

 news pandemic killing millions always come ""how long wear mask for""? completely understand economic impact lockdowns (especially schools) going immediately ""bUt mAsK"" every piece good news self centered.

There many things need bring back society economy-wise urgently. agree good news like means bring back sooner, maybe even soon. Encouraging wearing mask (especially indoors) maybe last thing think lifting. doesn’t like Chili’s?? Guess can’t millennial anymore 😂 Well, exactly.

“In November, Pfizer said two doses given 3 weeks apart, vaccine's efficacy 95%. according FDA analysis, strong protection 82% occurred first doses 52% two doses.

On Twitter today, Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, immunobiologist Yale University School Medicine, said one striking finding people protected early 12 13 days following first dose. added high affinity antibodies longer-term immunity likely require second dose...” restated argument, actually add anything address anything said. bring unrelated fact new Zealand. strain COVID we’re dealing endemic likely become endemic next several years. strain hasn’t existed long enough considered endemic. I’m seeing James Franco meme. First time? I’m worrying able send kids school tomorrow due fevers I’m afraid boss going flip out. Sad put position. really depends case case basis. Many older folks rely younger people supply care. many older people don’t family friends help them, yeah don’t work going whole time grocery stores places meet needs don’t means pay someone make someone else go them. Well even openly states pre-emptively planning getting available, employer planning make mandatory - see logic, firing bit much since moment available yet yet risk anyone else.

So can't really use 'putting people risk needed done', since moment even power mitigate risk yet. would say probably given warning planning make mandatory would put job line.

It's unlikely would changed mind never know. roommate nurse initially hesitant wanted 'wait see results get later', ended caving getting right away.

It's assumed awhile vaccines end pandemic.  reasons epidemiologists still struggling explain, virus seems decided take swift nosedive towards end pandemic, far earlier faster literally anyone predicting. 


If things keep going way even, let's say six weeks, pandemic US effectively vaccination program even get halfway done. 

I guess point open count fact takes time virus build again, time continue vaccinating, probably never gets foothold. still different scenario people planning two months ago. could possibly know stories true? I’m resentful towards regular older people honesty inconvenienced pissed measures. Politicians? Never liked them, care even less now. Except Bernie. He’s basically saint. series cases, controlled trial placebo group. Hence reason termed association opposed causative. could literally skip one month size trying get pregnant totally clear. hasn’t subject targeted study, yes, say “we don’t know impacts fertility” absurd. great handle vaccine works, plus animal studies, claiming could make sterile insane whackadoodle level propaganda.

Yeah, right. Fuck past. can't learn anything something past. exact thing last time surely give us different results.

Enjoy jab fuckers Mr. Glass looking her. blatantly lied received Bachelor Arts degree Antioch University Seattle? Blatantly lied visiting professor university? confronted false claims, claimed credits short degree attending classes special program. Guess what? blatant lie well since school stated special program exist?

This sexual assault happened, way? 
Do also ask women drunk, dressed, sexually assaulted? see credibility quickly leaking Tara Reade? **Especially something happened 30 years ago?**  


How something happened 37 years ago? Something one remembers supposedly there, remembered happened, around date, person making claim. strike credibility?

If critical her, i'm genuinely curious critical Christine Blasey Ford. cdc literally says reason delay pregnancy covid vaccine.

Jews came Judah took Canaanite city Jerusalem. Israelites Canaanites conquered Judahites short period confusion comes claiming Israelites Jews. no, Canaanites (Philistine/Phoenician/Israelite, etc) remained majority Canaan/Palestine day Jews occupied small area around Jerusalem many already migrated elsewhere since nearly 2,500-3,000 years ago. Hasmonean dynasty, persecuted forced Arabs, apostates, Canaanites, Hellenistai Judah convert Judaism. Yep. 100% agree. think I'm frustrated post called ""How Buy Real N95 Mask Online"" paywalled article, links removed automod, costco link $300+ worth masks, sources KN95 masks, discussion valved masks.

I would like buy Real N95 Mask Online. nurse. Covid know least ten people also got vaccine. haven’t heard anything worse chills fatigue 24 hours so

Personally minor chills sore arm link? Blessed fruit! mean? explain layperson? Theyre 68-98% less likely transmit disease? dropoff rate insane online again. think they'll it. We’ve person teaching year, Governor Foghorn Leghorn South Carolina says vaccinating teachers “immoral unethical”. mom's real one  It’s governments/politicians, though. It’s also institutions, like universities, royally exploiting us couldn’t care less collateral (our lives). condition getting full approval results longer term studies, could vaccines ever get full approval? ask ethically, let clinical trial participants control group know gave vaccinations well. could ever complete long term studies without control group anymore? Things back normal PCR international travel, quarantines enter China, Australia, New Zeland, Vietnam Taiwan among others. face masks public transport, new vaccine every year rest lives.

Like 11S new security checks bans air travel. Put airports alongside bomb sniffing dogs.

Although make sure remember dog which. Whatever. I’m normal summer. I'm really starting notice everyone coming woodwork saying they've previously scared say. sick BS. got extreme. Sure, really worked, sacrificed livelihood it. And, understand reason this, much misinformation surrounding virus keep people contracting it. also understand people say before. keep numbers lower, meant following guildelines. one expressed over. Everyone seemed like enjoying it. I'll it, vent sometimes, Reddit. this, grateful. Well disgustingly racist.  I'm gonna need lot information they're defining ""reinfection."" means trust fund kids view whoopsie whereas working class kids absolutely devastated fine. 

Such life. guess. richest country world, could given money companies mass produce vaccines risk. like India did. I'm one think US given vaccine paid like that, believe lot could done didn't. article sub interview production BoNTech. Nobody cares lipids. Surprise. EU produce literally everything literally now. delay rebuilding chains. Yeah don’t think that’s real concern. There's reason can't get vaccines mobilized first send help immediately elsewhere. see moral issue that. take care people first others. I'm sinking ship family friends sinking ship across harbor, I'm going best get friends family life boats sailing thither help them. selfish? pragmatic Found it, hopefully far KN95's fit ""little bit"" worse. lot worse. bunch them. Fit perfectly awful, even stay nose. Try get real N95's. still right make choice respected they’ve saying whole time masks work. mask shouldn’t issue. stupid fucking bullshit reason see many sick people work! Yes, message you. people charge. read lot people illness going work awards got perfect attendance. Czech Republic something even better - law saying ""when (officially) ill get refund state company first 3 days illness"". law 10 years people abusing former compensation law. got least 60 % money first 3 days... still quite demotivating imagine vast majority people still going work lose 40 % gains. think really stupid law. 100 % compensation hard working people 0 % people provably abusing system. Someone made unofficial NYC area vaccine appointment finder. I'll see find link. got Dad appointment Rochester NY Sunday night spending 3 hours official NY site, appointments closed Monday opening new group. know NY releases new appointments Sundays, opening new group Monday. nebulous term. normal means

\-100% schools, businesses sizes, sporting events, movie theaters, etc open ZERO masking requirements--then quite frankly he's probably right. Around time, 2022. 

But mean most/all things running summer, differing degrees ""non normalcy"" spent year university Japan would get docked 0.5% final grade every class missed. Cold-like illnesses valid excuse take time off. 

Always hated pointless rules. Especially since paying there. initial reaction ""good boss!"" read article realized wanted wait see data pregnant women. seems harsh. However simply ""I want take can't make me!"" fire means EU, Germany. Germany gets share EU. Period Well...no that’s true. China sequenced genome...and Arab world china together brought “western” civilization Venice ottoman—Venetian trade partnership 500 years ago. no. uni student I've completely online since March 99% recovery rate age 50 information UK used widely vaccinating 1 person approach. know voted. Numbers going worldwide. Weather US seem like best explanation. recovery rate age 50 funded R&amp;D paid doses. selfish us collect fucking paid for. obligation protect rando african country expense ours. couple years we're trying sell leftover vaccines poor countries, sure that's selfish. Protecting product poured billions not. empty wallet every time pass homeless guy? No? That's suggesting U.S do. Thank Really feels like story... That's well good, feel like speak many people say extra $300+ lying around masks. things really reason $1 per masks, especially since would mean people could wearing effective masks cheap. 

I got 20 pack K95s sale like $15, that's reason even any. 

Once gone, back cloth medical masks me. Canada paid vaccines per capita country yet like seven doses. better recruitment strategy works I'm sure they'd love hear one: recruit children.

I agree you, c’mon, isn’t strategy, it’s “what do.” question do? misleading study shown six fold reduction effectiveness rather presence anti body tethers Biden yday gave Christmas ""if goes well"" conservative even cautious given trends we're vaccines etc. guess possible factor could variants know something don't. article comparing Israel’s vaccination rates US.

THAT'S kids going back. I’d always use excuse ngl fate worse fate worse death?

That's pretty bad! someone comes family teachers (and was/will teacher I'm done staying home kids) approve this. Classrooms place learning takes place consider well-being whole child.

They need let everyone get vaccinated point. people getting stuck betterZ technically correct. would argue subset teachers care quality education actually lot bigger pesimists, like myself, want assume. Full disclosure, worked education working becoming teacher myself, honest issues profession system. 

A lot teachers care whole bunch. work butts deliver good ""educational product"". Caring lot working hard thing effective, proficient, good job. many teachers scrape by, even full engagement effort. achieve tenure matter all, get lazy. They'll probably job matter bad actually are. 

There ton teachers bad job care. Another big set care, suck great amazing. maximum potential high. another set care amazing potential be. another set care deeply proficient effective. teachers middle. care best, factors school student demographics, teaching environment, admin support, flexibility, patience really stressed results great real world performance. 

Teachers wierd complexes. designed job smartest person room. authority information, compete other. qualified, experienced, Innovative. tecahers take literally develop wierd ego driven presence classroom school. 

No one respects schools anymore pre packaged. Schools trying hard ""personalized learning"", that's hard implement effectivly control. 

Parents busy raise kids. Right wrong that's fact many families. Schools equipt it, everyone, including them, insists try have. fighting losing battle. 

End rant. Shits wack. try hard students, think really good, imposter syndrome shit comes along teachers real AF. understand many teachers dicks. would like what, 2 weeks 1 month difference? anyone even care point. vaccines still used. Yeah flying fuck shit sudden? Click journal links listed article gonna spread mutate regardless whether give scraps third world not. look like paid R&amp;D actual doses, deserve protect population. zero involvement either creating manufacturing it, they're entitled anything. Furthermore, there's limited supply, would different issue purely financial issue. We'd taking protection country giving rando African country, politician suggesting would get voted quick good reason.t let get called court. would fun day judge.

Yeah, he'll get erection get kids taken away - fun day everyone involved! /s exactly like game, won. Vaccines found. Don’t eradicate win game. It’s always satisfying though prepares real world. gotta work sick else eat roof head. thing sick days good old USA. Gotta work drop. Yes it’s bit like saying, eating bananas could potentially kill you. Title bad news, content actually good news. It’s while, started notice hear thinning falling mid 20’s started panicking researching hair loss.

Now, everything stuck, hair loss stabilized since, remember reading older ages lot people bald. old people hospital bald, think that’s pretty normal. percentage men suffering male pattern baldness goes age. early twenties even late teens, eventually, believe, men 50% experience age 50.

Not saying couldn’t factor severe Covid course. It’s definitely worth following up. sub hilarious. makes think one dose suddenly good two? evidence suggest it??

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes. Masks first thing go. Elementary schools, high schools, things. I'm sorry positions. truly horrible. Care point study segmented age? Yeah think so. Literally said accounted it. Except vaccinated negligible amount people Canada seeing drop cases every province regardless restriction levels Why? teachers want stay employed rightfully recognize could mean jobs people begin realizing much line work reduced use technology. great! I'm sure people appreciate ethic practice. bet whole organization sees better total outcomes due policies like this. Tbh least experience, young people largely supportive strong restrictions. old people know worried attitude May-June “I’d rather live life fullest even increases risk remain locked up”.

I’m defending either position, perceived. Great argument. worldmeter numbers dropping, cases, deaths. 2018 job, 98% attendance overall. numbers actually good, however working 12h shifts 2-3 days vacant 3-14 days times. urged take paid sickdays get numbers down.. give fines kids dont go school. 
But doctors dont want see either, cause cold flu give tylenol make sure plenty fluids. impossible get slips saying sick cant make it. Thats afford take doctor. system screwed up. joke many. know isn’t political sub don’t put past DNC run supremely unpopular candidate Exhibit A. work aren’t school? long strict lockdown stay-at-home measures stay place middle next year (which definitely should), believe achieve Covid-free society. new variants emerging well, makes wonder social distancing mask wearing enforced even achieve Covid-zero road. secured damn ps5 series x launch day, heck, even 360 back 2005. getting covid appointment cakewalk. evidence yet whether safe pregnant women receive mRNA vaccine. seemed like reasonable request give time.

until consider fact covid far likely mess proven safe effective vaccine. pure human stupidity devil know vs nature, society accomodate stupidity.  Title: “Pfizer says”

OP: “Pfizer didn’t actually say”

The whole article two small bullet points? think need better source this. result still beyter J&amp;J also one dose. False positives tests higher that. fun, let's make mind experiment:

change world ""UK"" ""China"". think safe say Covid far likely mess pregnant woman vaccine proven safe effective literally would nothing reproductive system it’s personal choice link says limited data. 

Sounds like she’s making informed choice get vaccinated since she’s trying get pregnant. 

In year two data (and actual vaccine approval) getting vaccinated reason may seem dumb limited knowledge seems like right one me. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah clearly didn’t look data tables data tables listed lab maximum number cycles, varied.

Glad deleted account though! reason people get fired outrageous call moral failure critical supplies aren’t donated free.

Anyone paid research getting deliveries, US. It’s sad countries need rely charity, it’s wrong governments taking care citizens first. fact, would suggest would unethical towards taxpayers.  Angry wrong man. Reddit. frustrating children legitimate illnesses end getting lumped unexcused absences that's fair. sounds like automated process. Well found husband's burner employees then? Besides, refusing take proven safe effective vaccine far dumber going eat, pandemic not. Theres differenced getting medicine body temporarily putting cloth face. Cool, that's eugenics. Well woman now. Every time idea continuing restrictions cases vaccinations reasonable level presented sub comments section mobbed people claiming we’ll locked indefinitely vaccines no. long take 95% immune second shot? Like many days also tend work death also fun. Go America! hard say. possible test positive even weeks infection even contagious. 

Only way know sure get test. language article heavily implies expect ill effects vaccine, aware didn’t specifically test pregnant women. remotely close to, “I can’t take Covid vaccine I’ll pregnant”. even gave everyone dose amount

Who ""they,"" this? [Pfizer Phase three trial arms testing two doses 10 μg, 30 μg, 100 μg respectively; [Moderna Phase structure, testing 25 μg, 100 μg, 250 μg respectively. You’re building arguments top assumptions based limited data, I’m saying level confidence necessary diverge proven approach vs unproven one higher level confidence necessary unproven approach vs status quo. 

Maybe data enough meet threshold experts know, maybe isn’t. 

It’s decide, suspect that’s haven’t shifted strategies yet. Possibly. Possibly not.

Imagine media outlet hearing half story China *not* running faced it, found far ok Get ready 1 month quarantines. lol ok. fun staying inside forever! Sure, wear masks flu season. vaccinations good chance death rate fall comparable level even lower. posit saying evidence infection via route, _after_ got everyone wash hands like crazy, particularly meaningful claiming little _risk_ infection via route.

This update seem based new information, like hangup comfortable assumptions amount virus actually ends packaging. 66.67% better. UK [clinical trial mixed vaccine right vaccines mixing provides _better_ protection, fingers crossed. Maybe trickier logistically people already fully vaccinated though. never never understand appeal wearing vermin hides fashion. Hoarding isn’t limited supply, patent manufacturing systems Western countries constrain availability vaccine globally. Rich countries pay break patent, accelerating access manufacture effective vaccines. security populations stake not, because, again, uncontrolled spread poorer countries going accelerate vaccine escape countries like US shown capable responding crisis using suppression measures (like South Korea, never locked down). Hundreds thousands dead overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure every 2-5 years recipe economic social disaster. would explain much messaging hopeful optimistic numbers seem show

I've wondering tone changed yet, makes much sense  Name 1 year wore masks flu season?  wow Stop trying tell people let lives lives. firmly maintain NZ's approach best mental health overall. fact probably best almost every way. Even economy suffered less Sweden's.

In Sweden, people still best stay safe, mentioned. government even making effort look (I assume). that's takes schools operate full capacity masks, distancing rules, etc. it. think missing point, lockdown causes depression anxiety Covid. really spell you? Agree. Holy shit. Use UK benchmark population 67 million. around 600k die year. kidding? done time. practically lose limb stay home. snow days. 3 feet fresh pow? GO SCHOOL.

Not saying good, right. absolutely positively norm. Remember ""perfect attendance"" award? kid sick everyone else.  question strawman argument. 

How answer question even make sense?

I responded point people use logical fallacies, give chance make coherent comment.  I’ve always struggled anxiety anxiety definitely much worse time last year. It’s come waves I’ve great stretches definitely feel it’s exhausting. I’m tired. agree that. I’d curious know Sweden approach better mental health even though damaging physical health. I’m kind thinking NZ/Sweden best mental health even though approaches radically different. said 60 million. know enough IV injections say, I'd assume not. mean due COVID restrictions right? COVID that's causing depression; politicians letting us live lives. Maryland get memo.

Yup. I'll trust expert something purely charitable foundation anyone financial stake game somewhere. is, unless want think best-case scenarios. ready harsh reality?

I pay taxes government, expect treated government. means vaccinated ASAP. 

The American government already barely gives shit citizens, want give even less shit us focus countries?

America last 1st world country focusing others. barely even focus is. really expect everyone stay home years? want don’t expect everyone to. Life gone like normal except wear mask go inside Yeah actually made illegal require people wear masks fortunate enough young, healthy, underlying conditions, little contact risk populations. Honestly, far greater risk depression COVID based data. willing take risk able go things/see people again. know that’s controversial opinion people’s eyes. think fair attribute unavoidable consequences COVID-19 COVID-19.

The problem they're entirely avoidable. country could've tried go NZ route actually stop COVID. least go partway route get R0&lt;1 watch fade away gradually. didn't. EU simply negotiated terrible contract screwed much bureaucracy wrong investment Sanofi.

Well, read CNN article? 
Actually took UK longer sign AZ deal top it, EU got way better price. Looks UK got worse EU favor fair distribution vaccines UK US, even less actually UK since we've invested covax other.

Before Covax, EU already started initiative fair distribution vaccines raised 15.9 billion EUR it: Coronavirus Global Response, launched President European Commission Ursula von der Leyen global action universal access affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment testing. European Commission's response global call action launched World Health Organization governments partners 24 April 2020, face pandemic.

The Covax contributions UK (640 millions) tiny comparison. Also EU gave additional 500 millions Covax top already doing.

For info this, check: plants EU produce vaccines countries world, EU. EU right thing here, UK US not. means set second trial evaluate dose timing.  chosen speed certainty original trial.   Funny see folks advocation halving dose. California cases per capita Florida lol wild great news! Since UK already dad got Pfizer waiting delayed 2nd dose, I'm really happy right thing reality never will

I'm actually tired repeating myself. honestly, big long response posted first class claptrap horse manure.

There's ""bargaining"" disease. There's ""bargaining"" science. 

Just.do.what.you're.told.and.lets.get.done.with.this.fucking.shit. Depressed hipster? 
Depster? Ohhhh one them. Sorry bothered. doubt that, point stands depressed anxious result people’s actions, approaching mentally healthy way. therapist help separate emotions people doing. Treatment often comes (in whole part) form cognitive behavioral therapy, step 1 get stop mental health tied people.

I know it’s hip cool blame GOP it’s healthy. job prove claim made. IV right? Ask therapist? like dog idea, want double checked catching variants case whatever smelling changes.

or double &amp; use dog plus regular test :) ""significantly help"" seems hypothesis point, given trial prove it.    advocated similar saying skipped phase 3 trials approved EUA end phase 2. point maybe make claims like prepared source. Otherwise, sound dumb.

 can't imply personally know 78 people sick symptoms questioned it, say ""I'm pretty sure heard radio even that's exactly right another guy said exaggerating"" get annoyed people take seriously. 

I mean did, really shouldn't.  Agreed correct answer. Also, Biden one decided federal buildings mask mandate. gives briefings? would *breaking law*. would add bad look. That’s licensing. Depends mean day 1. kind referring early-ish March.

Also know refers decision makers know, average rando

It quite clear wasn’t big risk children day 1. fact time certainty started wane little. I'm sorry, pure ignorance. like saying frequentist approach real approach Bayesian methods exist. dozens senior epidemiologists, public health experts, economists come say institutional strategy tackling problem rigid. UK realized problems currently seeing successful vaccine rollout among large countries result. got link found saying illegal? Ideally something facebook meme conspiracy theory website? envy covid subreddit mods. amount flaming, outlandish conspiracies anti-vax mumbo-jumbo astounding. I've trying find information long test positive COVID19 infection, found concrete answers. anyone resources??


I definitely exposed work January 21-22, notified 24th, asked quarantine 2 weeks. took test 26th one state's public testing sites. mild cold symptoms time. never received results assumed news good news (was supposed get phone call positive, email negative). Today, state's health authority called quick survey symptoms testing positive! shocked. 


I went back work scheduled February 8th, took pre-planned international flight February 14th. I'm flying home next week need negative COVID19 test re-enter, I'm sure test negative not.  Lol gotten single call back job since last March. wonder what's causing depression They'd still choice either staying trapped home, catching COVID. hopeful. kind choice. lol. Thanks sympathies :) sure option? still found information whether incompatibilities vaccines. Many children US school nearly year, many likely go 1.5 years without. way long. used vaccines?

Also mix two vials? give someone two half doses one other? feel that. tend get depressed compare much people things better, one really anything feel bad life. I'm normally really depressed around Christmas typically anyone celebrate with.. year seemed like people's Christmas canceled feel like left something everyone else gets participate in. 

Don't get wrong. like going restaurants, traveling, stuff. I'm hermit, lack social pressure nice. hope peace mind somehow hold even post pandemic. ""Believe me"". No, think will.

Good thing less 10 minutes using Google show anyone that's case (hint: legal fire someone refuse vaccine) It’s bottle. It’s needle. found way none needle. means clinical trial prove this.  test dosages too, maybe half quarter doses good enough.   mean time stick proven science. reason read ""1 3 adults"" ""look Ma, I'm celebrity!""

But nah instead grim. Bro, don’t mean taking seriously either. I’m saying we’re terrified, I’m saying we’re depressed isn’t life. Nobody’s paranoid, people sad can’t live. Yeah like flu suddenly vanishes March never returns lol Yeah afraid family die year you. unlike mental health depends titer variation general population. low variation, nearly effect.

On hand, easy extrapolate, comparison SA results AZ J&amp;J vaccines phase 1 neutralizing titers shows. Anyone knowing measurement period poor AZ result vaccination dates? spike protein configuration? diagnosed autoimmune disease high school missed quite bit Sophomore year recovering. remember getting truancy letter detailing days missed scheduling meeting principal, guidance counselor, teachers, parents discuss “avoiding” school. mom called doctor asked write letter explaining illness. doctor livid wrote letter said would go meeting needed stand medical standpoint. Nope, even (Slovenia). Schools closed 4 months partially opened. Unis still closed.  weird conclusion draw. Florida many people die covid last week Australia last year. 3 countries world deaths per capita Florida last week. 1100 families lost people last week. It’s ok opinion deaths necessary sake broader mental health, it’s weird say deaths aren’t “severely detrimental” suggest Florida’s approach better elsewhere. first could definitely wrong. based I've read, trial data outside US(UK, Brazil, South Africa) could reviewed enough data elderly participants get FDA approval, among inconsistencies may met FDA's standards. 

The elephant room AstraZeneca even submitted data FDA approval. speculate is, obvious answer knew would denied based standards. yes definitely waiting US trial finish think tells full story.

The part gets unclear enough data elderly patients. mention group got half dose regiment full dose. I'm assuming done elderly group lot data can't used, two dose regiment what's submitted approval. Actually, pretty helpful mindset know youre alone. use another needle syringe next person. bullshit article. software glitchy first built rush. 

The writer banned tech journalism. grandma scared stay home age 50 99% recovery rate hydroxychloroquine plus zinc cure many problems  UK Government hiding everything related vaccination. official position UK. Why? single-shot Pfizer idea takes hold would amazing... would nearly double capacity. train show work adult would guess. already think. case vaccination general. 

You don’t get decide don’t want it. employer fire you. assuming health risks young people COVID health risks flu even similar, long-term data known certainly known time shutdowns/stay home orders put place. Worry worry control. It’s control you’re powerless it.

Amor Fati friend, amor fati could wrong people given vaccines part trials purposely exposed covid? doctors monitored vaccinated people see developed (severe) covid symptoms? Apparently not, reducing dead volume needle purging remaining liquid air. think using sterile air vial prevent contamination. allowed teacher? true small minority country owns majority wealth? curious take that. got later start life finally living independently lot look forward to, three months got independence, COVID hit. 

Losing support systems killer. Minor league baseball job loved? Gone. May able work summer either unless it’s mask 90 degree temperatures. In-person Mass belonging church choir? Sorry, choir’s dangerous oh well Facebook Live church deal it. churches requiring reservations Mass kind community building social functions table. 

I’m community service group that’s still meeting Zoom desire part it. People still scared meet person organizations worked aren’t even taking volunteers COVID. 

Work home getting harder. department secretarial function lately treated like increasing anxiety making stressed used love job. someone else’s department doesn’t time, problem. Hire people delegate better. tasks specialized tasks team isn’t trained in, yet we’re expected dive limited background poor training it. 

It’s upsetting lose everything knew loved one acknowledges unless get kick calling “selfish.” instance job lost may part time seasonal still loved it, friend actually nerve say worth work it’ll save lives. really hurt. I’ve barely spoken since. 1/3 empty like Wont work well every country equally vaccinated 5% population year end either, realize right? It’s going take many years vaccinate everyone. volunteering wait end line? Yep, expected increase even Moderna / Pfizer increase supply J&amp;J gets approved. stupid? malicious? headed Linda Lacewell, attorney former chief staff Cuomo. Lacewell superintendent state Department Financial Services. task force members include state health Commissioner Howard Zucker...

The finance superintendent leader task force created health concern? health superintendent member?

This entire situation cluster. let covid positive patients facility filled susceptible. Find alternatives. Killing people one. Nope, quickly ramping 7-day moving average 890k Jan 20th.

Also nope, federal side things issue. instance, states built models federal vaccine numbers expectations drive distribution strategies. Trump admin lied large cache vaccines, actually never existed, tell fucked *my state* relying it. That’s one example.

And look - vaccinations *were* ramping up, I’m fighting that. strongly believe could lot farther along Biden federal competence. want get back normal life fast possible need competent admin. don’t care it’s Trump, Biden, Robo-Hitler Teletubbies, get done don’t fuck up! I’m republican nah don’t think they’ll probably call conspiracy it’s worth shot reducing chance someone passing variants resistant vaccines. simply game numbers.

Thank you. ""natural herd immunity"" stupid dangerous. addition whole lot death get whole lot variants. took global pandemic slackers get anxiety depression? That's lame. Legalize weed lets happy lot means nothing. Interesting definition.

European factories independent. Indians. add another percentage point every two days. not. delivered Professor Farnsworth. Yes, can. vaccine sites prioritizing keeping stock vaccines age 65+ individuals. one keep seeing NYC Walgreens/Duane Reade. Check here: may live NYC area, there's also know say appointments currently, however Monday except javitz available slots. would check daily. Hi 2 3 adults liars. see study large enough sample size draw conclusions effectiveness AZ vaccine South Africa variant. Yes US Europe shipped vaccines rest world we'd totally eradicate covid. would take like 5 years vaccinate whole planet right? Let's stay locked then. Cases deaths countries falling, means going down. overwhelmed. Many people put weight ended relationships whether marriage gf/bf relationships. Covid ruined lot people's lives. alone. Oh no, people forget Boris Johnson made sure spam enough media, specially near end Brexit negotiations - rest assured know.

Still justify slapping export ban AstraZeneca force deliver EU order 50%. 

For example, BioNTech received funding Germany EU see Boris Johnson say: ""oh please keep production vaccine wait"", recall correctly really happy receive Pfizer vaccines start kickstart vaccination UK - rightfully so.

The UK still receives Pfizer vaccines made Europe, we're still find altruism UK govt.

It's odd double standards, that's all. EU controls exports private companies, EU bad. UK enforces export ban private company, good contract? allowed criticize US gov spreading lies sars-cov-2 escaping WIV, otherwise get labelled cHyNeSe bot lol Apparently use air inside vial push “deadspace” liquid needle, doses drawn vial.

Google translated points inside metal needle, base base syringe vaccine left substance withdrawn bottle vaccinated. However, air bottle allows needles syringes drain areas waste fluid accumulates. Room air must added vaccine bottle syringe, technology uses air added inside bottle pharmaceutical plant. Yea, I'll take it. game fair. Pfizer must say deal, pays - get all.

But discover discovered shady deal UAE and, especially, Israel. Israel together UAE steals vaccine Canada proposed more. bribe corruption. past year, telling us vaccine goal, people vaccinated lives back. 

Now, guy saying keep restrictions indefinitely order keep cases low, even vaccine. That's completely unacceptable. 

If ends mutating enough substantially reduce vaccine effectiveness, booster shots, like flu. Get fact teachers close contact many students per day, many might wash hands socially distance. constant exposure puts higher risk. see every cold flu season, even infectious.

 work education person school year. terrifying. think US education system's focus perfect attendance prepare students future life factory standing spot day every day exact job function next 30 years. era people able take sick day needed.

Don’t get discouraged everyone’s definition “normal” different.

I would hope start NFL season September see fans back full capacity. people opportunity vaccinated then, somewhat ridiculous we’re yet then, opinion. county started vaccinate teachers, start recently halfway done. even vaccinated, reopening schools includes numerous restrictions.

For kids high school example, half students go 2 days week (half 2 days, half 2 days), remote learning 5th day per week. Kids wear masks, desks bolted floor keep distant, use laptops like remote learning teacher room them. phased bell schedule mingle halls. eat together, cafeteria one chair per table.

Sorry boat. pretty obvious states counties around country completely mixed teachers fall vaccination priority, whether teachers vaccinated means reopen schools.

Some areas vaccinating teachers requiring teach anyway.

Other areas vaccinating teachers closed schools.

Other areas vaccinating teachers, say even vaccinating reopen schools, teachers vaccinated without needing classrooms.

Some people say teachers vaccinated teachers i.e. good society, regardless whether going teach year.

It's pretty inexplicable. isn’t. one wants end live events, festivals, parades, music tourism industries among others. imo definitely much bigger factors playing role vaccinations.

when USA started drop vaccination rate minimal(specially taking account vaccine help first days) , also see example north dakota, experienced massive drop without help vaccines.

israel 20 doses per 100 population going down, cases sharply rising exactly unscientific (and apparently insane) run multiple sets trials testing different doses? Get it. then? cool.

European Commission President von der Leyen wants avert great medical challenges 'do whatever takes', former ECB CEO Mario Draghi promised avert euro crisis.

Europe switching war logic fight virus variants. makes pact European scale researchers companies mass production new generation corona vaccines. offers Belgium opportunities pharmaceutical biotech hub.

The European assumption AstraZeneca - never manufactured vaccines - would produce 3 billion doses year painfully naïve. world's largest serum institute India achieves 1.2 billion doses annual basis. ' credulity one lessons European diplomats learn bureaucratic approval procedures, slow purchasing slow delivery vaccines.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen admitted last week mistakes made. also realizes plan new European crisis authority hopelessly late hands deck fight dangerous potentially resistant variants corona virus. new unconventional plan attack, draws lessons criticism, hoping European leaders give approval video summit next Thursday.

Von der Leyen exchanges European bureaucracy strategy bio-defense: organized tightly managed collaboration politicians, industry researchers one goal mind: produce quickly many vaccines possible new virus variants Europe. wants avert great medical challenges 'do whatever takes', former ECB CEO Mario Draghi promised avert euro crisis. so, Von der Leyen reflects public-private partnership also forms basis American Barda, authority advanced biomedical research development. Europe lot research production capacity pharmaceutical biotechnology sector. However, clear overview entire production chain central management.

Exceptional means warranted times crisis, reasoning von der Leyen took recent Belgian-Danish proposal. Setting European vaccine production urgent challenge. “We time build factories,” stresses Thierry Breton, EU Industry Commissioner.

""The solution dashboard connects companies Europe work together,"" clarifies source close prime minister. Now, collaboration - example, production doses Curevac vaccine GSK site Wavre - comes chance contacts CEOs companies.

Belgium pharma hub
Europe already powerhouse vaccines today wants exploit power. ""Belgium sees pioneer European story,"" say sources prime minister. Belgium hub biopharma incubator biotech companies Argenix Galapagos. pharma platform consultation government, research domain companies expanded biomedical platform.

European control necessary rapid detection analysis virus variants. data tests shared. Europe also fund network clinical trials across Europe. testing facilities conduct tests children young adolescents. 'We virus contagious exclude children vaccination, especially want achieve herd immunity summer.'

The bureaucracy disappearing. New purchase contracts must provide detailed plan delivery vaccines. approval procedure accelerated - also European Medicines Agency EMA. Commission even wants use rapid emergency procedure vaccines case share liability manufacturers.

If Member States support European approach, important step towards joint crisis response. member states resist, Europe fall completely vaccine race spiral division threatens. European sources expect little opposition companies: 'They also benefit clarity European scale'. perfect attendance throughout high school, didn’t miss single day. average student. arg bad, know missed that, thank you!

We know natural immunity persists past 6 months, vaccines prompt stronger immune response natural infection. idea immunity shot would evaporate 3/4 week mark make much sense. there's reason think would vaccines. Impossible answer. depends variant going around type vaccine shot got. speaking Biontech Astrazeneca Johnson Johnson example ? different vaccines different efficacy different variants. 
The promising Biontech vaccine actually seems best one terms efficacy even one knows happen future possible escape mutations. 

I read study new england journal medicine reported two-thirds drop neutralization power variant B.1.351. compared forms SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. 

""Thus, compared neutralization USA-WA1/2020, neutralization Δ242-244+D614G virus similar neutralization B.1.351-spike virus weaker approximately two thirds. data also consistent poorer neutralization virus full set B.1.351-spike mutations virus either subset mutations suggested virus mutant residues receptor-binding site (K417N, E484K, N501Y) poorly neutralized virus Δ242-244, located N-terminal domain spike protein.""

&amp;#x200B;

However study points limitations:

 
""Limitations study include lack systematic examination individual mutations potential mutations alter neutralization affecting spike function rather antigenicity. onset protection one dose BNT162b2 precedes development high neutralizing titers, BNT162b2 immunization also elicits CD8+ T-cell Thus, unclear effect reduction neutralization approximately two thirds would BNT162b2-elicited protection Covid-19 caused B.1.351 lineage SARS-CoV-2.""

&amp;#x200B;

But take look summarize know, one knows right even CDC points reseach needed considering recent variants possible future escape mutations higher selection pressure leading possible vaccine resistance. 2nd dose booster, help keep high immunity level long term. Please def get 2nd dose chance! Power overwhelming Huh? mean case countries. give another shot cases deaths grow joking? 

How many factories built Israel? UAE? UK? Japan? NZ? lot death disparity compared case count US Israel came begging pandemic hospitals overwhelmed, nursing homes exposed (accounting close half US covid deaths date), didn’t lot knowledge, strategies, COVID drugs reduce COVID deaths. much better keeping deaths compared case counts today. death count skewed high US reasons higher untested cases, overall, probably right. Lets spread news around. anything get republicans board this. Germany gets approximately 18% EU delivery.

If German newspaper reports ""1.8 millions Moderna expected Q1"", Europeas ordered 10 millions Moderna doses Q1.

This simple correct. Germany can't buy vaccines self. comment political according bot apparently. Worst bot I've ever seen. No, pretty fucking clear rest developed world usual Americans don’t want listen. UK's official contract actually dated August 28, one day EU's contract.

However, find date UK contract relevant. signed EU contract, making whole ""first come, first served"" argument moot. ""What shut downs?"" - Republican governors vaccines evenly distributed every country world, per-capita vaccination rate would low vaccinated people would already losing immunity time communities even reach 10% vaccinated. also got heavily criticised Reddit experts You’re mentally ill.

Of course bald 30 year olds filling ICU. Age remains important risk factor. long term immunity? We've known time one dose heavy duty immunity line second dose make immunity long lasting? studies defining male pattern baldness though? people acquiring official diagnoses young ages, people thinning hair obviously know common age?

Accelerated hair loss also attributed stress, nutrition, etc. could put risk severe symptoms. seems really presumptious say baldness would somehow worsen COVID deaths. Correlation causation. Nobody saying people jobs, instead getting 5 training regurgitate info get 8 requires critical thinking, problem analysis alongside practical application prior known knowledge. lot schools never get practical application literally class often times pushes flat barf knowledge exact words. 

Schools fail help understand much actively control control. job something agree base level easily negotiate even deny do, two things alone something school. Children's education literally important thing society must do.

Virtual school year = mostly Zoom, ""full classroom"" feel. Still largely Google Classroom-based, simultaneous live teaching sessions.

We eventually switch hybrid, I'm aware that's case everywhere. districts even floated prospect split scheduling, even virtual, next school year. think improve instruction uncertain times?  true, false economy. struggle proletariat bourgeoisie false consciousness, classical Marxist terms. Marx went wrong believed laboring class would ever position take bourgeoisie, matter, would real interest so. doesn't; reality, capital labor need much fight.

The real struggle technocracy bourgeoisie: expertise versus capital. usual, proletariat stakes game; work bureaucracy; others private sector; constitute ""class"" utterly divided interests, therefore class all, different relations means production. Teachers, cops, bureaucrats, firefighters, derive welfare taxes, capital. 

The fact cost either dueling, ruling classes help workers neglect them; indeed, helps them; makes everybody's lives better. arguably; demonstrably, obviously better. reducing pollution same. yet bourgeoisie US, unlike civilized nations, actually seems enjoy impoverishing workers, somehow benefited that. Roosevelt said, people think way traitors class.

What bourgeoisie needs make world better rule set much *compel* right thing, *incent* right thing, *permit* without losing competition. ideal role government capitalist/Lockean/cooperative/""free"" society. first time life, think executive power US, right now, understands this; first time, hopeful future.

Yeah said know Biontech vaccine seems far best one variants. already knew although need studies finally prove it. one can't vaccinate entire world biontech soon...

Other vaccines much lower efficacy like astrazeneca. Soutafrica actually stopped vaccinating population astrazeneca efficant enough.

It funny one clearly already made mind. :D Oh please, look posting constantly reddit day every day. either job cushy enough position get away it. pandemic inconvenienced one bit compared people lost jobs, livelihoods, even lives. Wearing mask least inconvenient thing right going forward. someone explain many say we’ll need masks well 2022 maybe even 2023 people expected vaccinated July? see you’re saying...I suppose could work metropolitan areas...but tenure? Isn’t goal teachers? wish could trade memories peanut butter shot vaccine may reduce anti-body protection 2/3 still able neutralize virus, don’t know yet trails variant reduces vaccine protection. Yeah that’s clear all.

But fact talking altering vaccine adding booster shots kind hints effective newer variants namely SA variant, story vaccines. Let’s hope it’s anywhere near efficacy performance like AZ vaccine SA variant, doubt don’t surprised drops 60-70% efficacy range SA variant. article Aug 2020 info COVID changes constantly newer studies. it’s accurate article reference would suggest finding recent one also covers new strain. Yeah genetic 95% men form lives. crazy fast dropping off, looking CA's website today went 55k cases day 4k cases day Jan 8 Feb 16th. zero changes/lockdowns burning via herd immunity/vaccine point.

Yea, bootstraps jazz. I'm Canada, countries without lockdowns, businesses better, visible, even without much analysis. Thank you! Source? kind guidelines? one would *think* lab position might well update say, communications procedures time like that.

So good know balding catch COVID easier, know hospital data suggests probably ""any age"" baldness that's causing hospitals filled. Nearly baldness seems alopecia, aged 50 half men form baldness thinning, 60 2/3 men do, goes there.

Sorry yes less 7 since 4.0 7.0 listening podcast recently Kristen Neff said something helped alleviate panic depression me, maybe it’ll help redditors. I’m also paraphrasing/taking site I’ll link below: 

Often times feel worst, feelings magnified there’s element self judgement feel we’re suffering alone. 

(Direct quote site) “Sadly, however, people don’t focus common others, especially feel ashamed inadequate. Rather framing imperfection light shared human experience, they’re likely feel isolated disconnected world around fail. focus shortcomings without taking bigger human picture account, perspective tends narrow. become absorbed feelings insufficiency insecurity. we’re confined space self-loathing, it’s rest humanity doesn’t even exist. isn’t logical thought process, type emotional tunnel vision. Somehow feels like one dumped, proven wrong, humiliated.

And even we’re painful experience fault — perhaps we’ve laid job economic downturn, instance — often irrationally feel rest world happily employed it’s sitting home watching re-runs day.”

So me, definitely overly critical *and* tend think I’m alone shittiness, I’m person world feels defeated lazy unproductive right now. no, it’s good news people depressed anxious, hope appreciate fact we’re alone feelings. 

If you’ve never heard Kristen Neff, look up. work amazing I’m woods means, research website treasure trove positivity trying times. Hope everyone’s well. 

Site: idea intimidate others “exemption card” valid. honestly, get. I’m sure many hotel worker, restaurant servers, etc silenced tactics like this. necessarily believe them? Probably not, going potentially risk jobs lash back someone willing take far wear mask? lots free time watch movies tv series. like life time stolen. People know use without regular work bored.

A.so fact America pay welfare relief nowhere close would sufficient reason People suffer. money. I'm young generally healthy want everyone truly needs vaccine get me. boy, suffering severe, severe vaccine envy lately. Trying remain patient tough. Hello there! trolling support biggest expert pandemics United States? really far gone country? lawyer another thread doctor one liar. saga about. Pfizer shortfall spread evenly among different countries ordered vaccine, whereas AZ shortfall passed EU vaccines produced UK destined UK market first. think second time it.

YIKES sucks. scheduled get vaccine soon (or feel kinda pointless right now)? Yep, news positive. can't profit enough 2 3 depressed anxious due society. lawyer another thread too.

Which ya big phonie?

You MD Attorney law? measures like masks social distancing continue play key role, virus continues circulating high levels, likely often come contact with, try infect, people vaccinated, Mina said.

I going guess advocating continued mask wearing social distancing virus circulating **high levels**.

Which makes sense. vaccines work predicted, virus quickly drop low levels circulation. Well...no that’s true. China sequenced virus...and Arab world china together brought “western” civilization Venice ottoman—Venetian trade partnership 500 years ago. no. could get people might think consider factual science based statements political. Fuck off, statist. mean virus 99,9% survival rate would make people depressed. harsh measures lockdowns nothing it. There's light end tunnel though, people get vaccines... measures lockdowns stay place! anyone read reviews? Apparently deliver customer service nonexistent. never forgive either. Well, young. Looks like getting hitched. win!! correct question be: Taiwan ever talked Shanghai Fosun supply BioNTech vaccine?

I guess answer NO, explains ""POTENTIAL"" Chinese pressure. read article... say 150K people removed, said list 150K shorter. extra dose better extraction needles methods, lesser doses. Pfizer delivers promised. Pfizer problem. fun others without pants. new normal. pants. EU pretty weak position going forward going need updated jabs, means (in regards AZ) UK funded Oxford university, knows long? EU wants good relationship vaccine provider Country, going funny way. hell even going on? anybody know?

At given time sub find 3 articles say Pfizer works variants, 3 say doesn't. Summer school etc meant punishment make sure child catches properly without held back. 

Very public schools actually punish child. making sure get adequate education. Florida local mask mandates (although they're enforceable per DeSantis's orders) lots stores ask wear masks going in. people see wear masks live.

I think we're well strong hospital networks due elderly population. never resource crunch like New York California. also warmer weather average lots sun (UV), kills virus outside. also know ton counties installing UV lights HVAC systems buildings like schools, sure across country.

I mean, we've lot COVID deaths well, catastrophic like places. Yeah switched jobs well start virus included move across country. went many hoops keep safe ended renting RV move stay hotels fly. honestly pretty nice things considered

But coworkers flying Mexico shit resort vacations I'm like 😑 saying done willy-nilly, studies data analyzed, US, country world still woods yet, halving vaccination saturation worth risk imo. last time happened sent less vials US account 'extra' dose.

Sort of. US letting count extra dose unless ship vials low-dead-volume syringes required extract extra dose. able secure enough syringes, Pfizer decrease number vials sent - started counting vial doses.  


In case, potentially excellent news. seven doses extracted Pfizer vials, technique require special syringes, means supply 20-40% larger thought. means people get vaccinated sooner. wife separated COVID. Mostly issues pre-COVID. pandemic sort pressure cooker. foundation wasn’t strong good luck. 

My two cents, solution. another hard time time. It’s temporary. hopeful that. pretty dark place myself, I’m working I’m working marriage. I’ve relinquished illusion control everything I’ve never felt better. Also therapy. it. Excellent idea. ### 30 Million can't sell $3.75 pop.

Sorry. concern. available normal sources (even industrial suppliers), hence people saying they're available.  LOL no. understand, harming others take vaccine? vaccines may protect 100%, people taken one, risk negligible right? point force everyone take annual flu shot well we're it. 

I also assume exact stance every year Covid-19 someone take flu shot? keeps going longer already was. worse. probably exercise. God bless you. saving lives. brave! please go away  Oh, even overpromised British government. worth, experience KN95s terrible. hurt ears seal face. Nope, nothing wrong unemployed either. Initial data says yes, published yet, probably enough time passed. made smile. happy you!! opinion. enjoy human society somewhat looking forward pants-wearing occasions. fine, vaccine mandatory employees. choice:

Get vaccinated stop working there. Really simple. wants private life business, wanting kid change fact vaccine mandatory employees. Breaking News: 2 3 adults lie depressed anxious due COVID-19 population Hubei 58.5 million 150,000 elderly people dying 3 months seem like would dramatically different expect. would 600,000 year 1% total population year dying. average lifespan ~75 years. want proof China lying believe it. Thank you, makes sense. Admitting first step towards seeking help, maybe? That's kinda positive this. they've also decided send less vials since order specific number doses, vials. Job searching/switching careless, many people lost jobs need find work support themselves. neither job switching someone find better job financially anything else allowed especially time. horrible fallacy. think teachers deserve plenty protection, think Florida, Texas, states proven protections given well adequate. Community spread dangerous teachers school spread. 

Which means, teacher fine grocery store workers exposing HIGHER risk teacher exposes school, picketing grocery store workers impossible standard zero risk met.

The damages children disastrous, risk teachers taking teach person well worth it. science denier. horrible selfish person. Yeah man. would use butter knife wedged little slit knob supposed be. destructive kid fml. NC restricting state people getting vaccines inside borders?

ICUs full everyone needed ICU bed get one die 99% time would lead much higher fatality rate. position makes rules like that, earth would advocate paid sick leave? Agree here. think concerns baby's development valid. Keep stimulated possible. Talk sing whenever can. get better keep hanging on. Im impressed impersonators 81 yrs old. Seems kinda sus already face. vaccines, goddamnit? ones have? live one richest countries world, home half Astra Zeneca, absolutely idea going get vaccine, vaccination program moving excruciatingly slow speed despite pouring mountain cash it, VACCINES EXIST.

And guy, less line entire political career, comes stupid, meaningless impossible platitude look nice, country one highest numbers dead per capita vaccination program manages even incompentent ours?

This guy going finally manage get Le Pen elected I'm not. think impossible situation he's done good job could given circumstances. Mask mandates, economic aid, closures select business sectors, etc .

And comparing states... would've done ""good"" Florida, 10,000+ Californians would dead. 1 3 adults depressed anxious due complete failure entire governmental system tax money gets wasted by.

FTFY Yes agree. infections get bad restrict. improve, ease restrictions. vaccine widespread last ease restrictions permanent. run ICU beds fatality rate increases. Warzone saved us That’s august dummy! Since millions kids gone back school zero outbreaks  2, one dirty liar already depression &amp; anxiety covid Seem like Pfizer claim 93% efficiency 28 days first dose want change recommendation one dose. 


Astra-Zeneca one supposed one dose changed two. Johnson &amp; Johnson one dose. Also something using 12 weeks doses Astra-Zeneca one. would kinda think maybe matter much maybe waiting bit longer better. would overrun health system. so, move balding men higher priority list receive vaccines then? exactly, fully protect country distribute table scraps among many countries need? We're also missing point we're *literally going giving hundreds millions doses away free* we're done population. charity, vaccines want, they're need. monetary issue would completely different story, plenty spare. vaccine spare unfair U.S government expected abdicate responsibility protecting citizens first foremost. Well gave priority emergency approval vaccines, yes, better make noise it.

And AZ better pray EU pull contract, happens, lawsuits start rain them, country EU itself. Well also seems like Americans huge outbreak amount people recovered virus vaccine bringing number down. europe locked less cases less people antibodies rely vaccination along Australia nz read data? Username checks i’m immunosuppressants well concerned efficacy. hearing shit times good news cuz means must work😂 jokes course, getting second dose tomorrow. hope shitty time :) problem ~~idiots~~ brilliant lazy persons EMA, must fired. Because, example, understand meaning term pandemic thus declaring professional incompetence. 

Especially person, Emer Cooke, get position because... know reason. come WHO! WHO, got epic fail trying manage corona pandemic.

 
We pay nothing, also give former bureaucrats top position EU lot money responsibility? Great, great. That's fair. earloop style bother ears bit long time, work well grocery store trips. headband style ones too. 2meirl4meirl I'm 20, dare call old I'm sure fine three years 333... never gets rounded 34. Highly doubtful. one going accept lockdown season every year. That's economically financially unfeasible country municipality. Well secretly enforcing it, leak makes seem like contractual basis (which even worst) - government yet refusing maybe lying.

Well, quite serious lie. curiosity, think realm possibility way around?

Because know far: AstraZeneca exporting single vaccine EU, claim British government allow it. know, one wants admit Biden bought paid stooge. EU screwed vaccines price going paid unfortunately unless want voted out. Canada donating extras get population vaccinated. They've publicly stated this. interesting Hungary Czech Republic going up, nearly every country world going down. 

I wonder what's different. mean... shitty is, least two still love other.  Wait that’s works, vaccine “in effect” training body duration symptoms, acetaminophen (assuming state true) decrease vaccine effectiveness  bonafidemasks.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Really? That's interesting. tell 2 half million dead people. maybe swing let 108 million cases know that, despite long-term organ damage they're going deal with, decided say ""screw it"" tough cookie.

If anxiety high realized many anti-science people like there. incredibly unnerving human would actually say ""screw it"" point. ✋ possible doubt lockdown restrictions flu. read data, favor getting people one dose fewer people two Soooo person argues business owners force people work sick. tell business owners thing. rationalize don’t business?

Are saying OP liar? long there’s spaghetti, I’m good. feel Olive Garden? Don’t worry, I’ll bring masks people. They're new depressed anxious, we're old depressed anxious. isn't, absolutely right. living hell. “clearly preferential” simply editorial opinion. suggesting senior community location serving receive vaccine?

Are suggesting states send vaccines county allow county handle distribution? Think logistics nightmare, since it’s kind thing counties usually equipped for.

And keep mind threat implies “do else” condition! 

In case “threat” is: take vaccines we’re sending we’ll send somewhere else! 

If don’t want there, suppose state could simply throw away, think would better solution someone uses them!

I’m sure alternative here! issue taking preemptively. taking start reaction. tough handling liquids small volume. tends stick sides container pool bottom. small liquid handling devices lot issues delivering every last bit. Example. Think syringe needle work. push plunger far go expell liquid that's actually needle? what's known 'dead volume"".

Most time one cares 99.99% situations deal things like 'overfill'. situation totally unique people want get last microliter vials. Hence specialty equipment specialty techniques. EU seem spend huge amount time crying vaccine that, apparently, want lol be. doses available people scheduled appointments weeks ago second doses.

And probably people got ""wrong"" first dose also allocated second dose. Oh am. know otherwise rational optical engineers still thought covid would almost dissappear media election. mind blowing convenient conclusion completely botch two dose vaccine rollout I'm seeing psychiatrist diagnosed completely different disorder mid late 2020. tests took indicate level depression anxiety - since causing acute distress I've never felt like harming others we're waiting see goes away trying treat quote Dr: ""Being sad worried perfectly reasonable way feel life right now.""  would assume everyone wrote, edited quoted article misinterpreted read data. big accusation make, based absolutely nothing. agenda here? UK US? getting vaccines EU exporting ZERO vaccines. ZERO. really. Depression joke. teachers would like vaccinated coming back person school able guarantee 5-day, in-person teaching soon they’re fully vaccinated, excuses stipulations vaccination Right Covid hit, intermittent fasting pretty close-to-Keto Keto Diet. lost 30 pounds. cruising.

Now, got back. I'm trying maintain, Herculean effort. Gone Keto Diet (carbs comfort food), gone (I much time sitting around nothing)...I'm hoping vaccine mainly get back wanted happened. still hope, really want yet another virus among us. people suffer symptoms all. take shot. UK government can't secretly force export wanted. nothing contract, seen. nothing medicines ban list.
So maybe lying. great, India kicking ass vaccines. Motrin water: Ricky Cure-All Umm, kinda hypocritical call OP thread that's brigaded daily politically driven accounts insinuating masks, restrictions, etc. useless get virus harmless. get give. exposed virus compounding, reduces risk ~93%.
But since less people infected (for example) half population vaccinated, time chances exposed reduced well. Pfizer vaccine effective first dose, really shouldn’t worried working variants.

If hand it’s effective, stick original dosage timeframe laid clinical trials ensure maximum protection. teachers going home vaccine priority. teachers going back classrooms priority. strange, remove COVID storyline really good year 2020. Job secure, work home, got big raise, so, fortunate. anxiety whether I'm get totally blindsided kept awake lot nights. hope nightmare ends soon sake people lucky was, man. poll bit confusing, one side have—

""States wait reopen teachers received vaccine"" 

and is—

""Schools reopen soon possible, even **all** teachers received vaccine.""

The first option specify whether mean 100% teachers need vaccinated, second specify whether mean even 0% teachers vaccinated. anonymous academic say reviewed data. likely RFA interviewed short question get ""third party opinion"". 

It's trust scholar. trust RFA communicate ""anonymous scholar"". Umm makes sense ethical way providing fair compensation based known risks, additional compensation unknown risks pop up.

Wife middle destroying life he's depressed anxious. problems covid made exponentially worse. depend variants, South Africa dumped AZ vaccines refused give seem like working new variant.

So, looking good AZ, EMA pull plug moment due new variants. Hopefully not, good EU shifting towards mRNA, seem work well new variants! I'm talking results, addressing policy K would great could least start vaccinate healthcare workers, plan problems. enough vaccines AstraZeneca would vaccine easy send. even less it. Bro people faint flu vaccine blood taken. People faint around needles. surprising thing. school reopened since August. I’d still like get vaccine though. Splitters. country came close RESULTS New Zealand.

Because several countries without good weather, timing isolated due geography tried strict lasting lockdown regimes border closures. One example country tried New Zealand Europe Ireland. reality, results achieved proved practically impossible interconnected, densely populated countries relaxed point.

New Zealand's biggest advantage perhaps luck. virus never got big numbers. never possible European countries. Here, know virus free run late 2019 January even noticed. stabilished local population cannot eradicate it. Lol literally going post this. brother includes ""mourning"" emotion feel like depression.

Sure. not. add pile. Canada here. want know thing. covid back December, I’m weird state trusting what’s left antibodies/t cells thinking I’m immune  government forcing them, could would make merry hell it.

Which doing? literally telling one largest trade blocks world can't deliver vaccines - bound save lifes major socio-economic impact- government allow it.

I think realize serious likely money. Prices different AstraZeneca vaccine. Thought around £3 jab, Pfizer £15. doubt planned source EU EU factories start shipping UK cost them. Especially speculated EU cheaper deal.

Again, price would say would price, export ban. Pfizer selling double EU price Isreal still delivering EU. trying find excuses assuming pharmaceutical lying EU, nothing points lying - fact, ones trying hide behind elusive UK government: refuses comment, refuses release rectified contract public, hiding behind contract apparently ""best effort"" clauses EU.

You seem try find speculative excuses. Depressed &amp; Anxious crew: Who’s me!!! Don’t sad!! percentage us seriously pissed off? Every state already process reopening even vaccinating elderly at-risk, so... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ likely smaller 

Most rural school districts state far larger (physically student body size) schools city school districts, massive student bus service districts, bringing kids together multiple small towns county-centric groups.  

YMMV, generally seems way they're funded. Every good response would looking like overreaction works. believe something said Fauci. wasn’t shady deal. It’s open it’s necessary deal Pfizer scientific data. one stole anything. “We forget,” «мы не забываем» lol okay buddy. fight injustice! doubt we'll learn.

Here dude clearly avoiding facts Crazy part probably wear one inside hotel way pool room. process take 5 min cases. Thanks sharing. excerpt fucking nightmare fuel. Make note based NEJM study we've known since December showing high levels protection starting 2-3 weeks first dose 2nd. know longevity protection, there's reason believe level protection drop sharply. we've seen similar arguments made study before, including sharp experts US well.

I think there's growing consensus (WHO, CDC, Canada's NACI, EMA, etc) delay 42 days safe affect efficacy, think every jurisdiction look actively so.  Quebec's UK's 12 week delay seems riskier though.

The one thing policy makers councils would keep eye though variant exposure, noteably, South African variant.  Pfizer Moderna effective it, want highest levels immunogenicity , increases greatly booster shot. areas variant threatens become dominant, delay doses probably best idea. Oregon, governor prioritized teachers seniors came vaccinations. However, school districts (including mine) likely won’t even open school year. Elementary schools starting person month middle high schools, doubt it’ll happen year. Meanwhile, 70 year old grandma can’t even get vaccinated yet! US exempt countries like India giving away even Russia/China exporting US export controls. Hell, even EU still exporting. Literally US UK hoarding own. interesting given previous studies said Pfizer effective it. Yeah but, we’re probably done summer time year. betting man I’d say people get back old routine won’t even thinking much year five years. mean is, without Oxford providing vaccine, factory. "" Given China's rapidly aging population, academic wished remain anonymous told RFA increase number elderly collecting subsidies, much less dramatic decrease ""

There confusion posts, thinking I'm anti-restrictions whatever. Actually, I've getting sides.

The virus serious business. kills people. makes people sick long time. people lose sense smell/taste. people get sick all, *no idea* why. Yes, I'm ignoring age distribution stuff here, know people every age *can* get really sick. really want loss smell taste happen me. That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose, spite me* there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices.

The virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up. 

If think ""defending"" China, beyond help.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever. Masking easy, yeah, suck, anymore. I'm ""pro-mask"" point. seem work, myriad reasons. Double masking dumb, idea comes good intentions. Experts [trying hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING protect people deadly virus. really difficult you, I'm sorry. 

Please assume troll argue conservative subs I'm conservative. I'll get banned eventually. "" One hundred forty-eight patients (64 ± 12 years, 70% male) severe COVID-19 infection \[all requiring hospital admission, 48 (32%) requiring ventilatory support\] ""

"" patients ischaemic injury pattern, 66% (27/41) past history coronary disease. ""

You're citing small study mostly older males, 1/3 already history heart disease, unusually severe cases. even know 2/3 also undetected cardiac disease. relevance population large (the overwhelming majority mild cases requiring hospitalization), let alone children. Yet another useless FUD article promote doom without tying general case providing hint common aggregate. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've Said saying. Saying Said?

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

Oh goodness. like read comments something...  people vaccinated spread virus?

People downvoting science, they're beginning downvote scientists skew toward excessive doom. credit, adjusted pandemic fine consuming media pass time, need psychologist. he’s happy, seeing one wouldn’t make sense. What's lag time reported deaths like? FL reported 165 new deaths yesterday 6 deaths actually happened 16th according state dashboard. think biggest issue herd immunity counting mutating something vaccine earlier antibodies treat. take one small mutation another year. reduction infections, there's herd immunity vaccination, basically 100% reduction deaths. Hope variants change picture much Pfizer vaccine. News today says antibodies plummet 66% SA variant, making Pfizer vaccine third effective original variant.

But mean take - protection better protection all.

Macron mentally ill crackpot. least I’m significantly less ever since don’t need commute wake 1 min classes :) actually biggest critique think countries hard lockdown.

You would think would secured vaccines moment could start vaccinating Australia NZ seem really taking time rolling out. Let’s go buy yurt together. think ready. seriously think Putin accomplices give damn rest world thinking they’re “worse Hitler”? don’t think so.

Uh, yeah do.

Dude, calm down. took EMA what, 10 days longer FDA approve Biontech/Pfizer vaccine? legit concerns Puurs production quality compared Mainz.

The EMA fault terrible vaccine delivery schedule. right here. It’s schools rewarded it. Hell high school missed less 3 days semester exempt taking final exams. everything could make sure never miss 3 days. said, revealed news agents use sources online state got anonymous source/scholar (technically lying source specified author).

I need discredit them. article good. second hand piece citing source partially without providing original link, bad already. partial citation makes jumpy too. ""anonymous scholar"" help, familiar journalism works. Maybe original article could clear. There's lot speculation comment several countries tried policies strict New Zealand worse got absolutely nothing it. homie.. UK based decision vaccines logically work. used deductive reasoning. Yeah could worked us logic pointing working. Well mean public schools closed, private schooling still full speed ahead. gap pay. People accepting Zoom conference calls substitute proper education rude awakening. needs front page. thinking terms area population. good chunk population multiple lockdowns.

Say 100 ICU beds full lockdown. think ICU cohort mortality rates 30% maybe 30 people would die. tripled infection rate (R0 seems around 1 lockdown around 3 lockdown) would 300 people needing ICU beds. 100 would get 30 would die 200 would get likely would die 230 people dead. closer 7.6x dead scenario. Moreover, compelling data 1 dose provides approximately 80% efficacy among elders mobidity factors (80% vaccinated, 33 331 40 000) healthcare workers (approximately 50% vaccinated, 172 979 320 000) reduced number deaths among elders Quebec.

Source (in French): can't imagine would depressed. employer cancelled performance based raises (even though work harder Covid), reduced retirement contributions, cut back much vacation accumulate, telling us important necessary were. None us gotten take vacation we're working unpaid overtime (being exempt great), can't travel due restrictions anyway. I've lost people cared Covid, basically living fear year now. Seems like super happy way things going.. states actually allocating vaccines individual counties?

I live CT sign get vaccine, absolutely restriction county get in! It’s finding appointment.

But anyway, here’s analogy see it.


You cook dinner family put nice healthy plate food front youngest child. 

She says, don’t want want chicken nuggets.

You say, I’m giving chicken nuggets, eat gave I’ll give brother.

Headline “Parent threatening starve kid!” Italian fashion industry deep ties China. Milan particular, northern Italy hit hard early due travel. think countries succeeded keeping covid away failed vaccination may eventually see large spikes infections time come. employment-at-will doctrine disagrees you. Mine too. believe law return money budget slated care use care. new fiscal year started bunch extra money.  mean, AZ vaccine **is** factually less effective SA variant. Maybe SA variant spreading France? know. turned 36, unfortunately still anxious depressed. France actually backed BioNTech instead banking Sanofi Pasteur, might actually position donate vaccine doses former colonies Boris Johnson said friend dealing outbreak care home England even though staff residents first dose end December. *laughably...*

*All countries gonna get vaccine end, lots vaccines gonna production.*

I propose, Israel UAE wait end vaccination get eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

This fair ... Israel UAE CAN'T compete EU financially.

This fair ... Israel UAE invested zero vaccine development(as EU, UK US).

This fair ... Israel UAE even dint pay early help build infrastructure.

Israel gets vaccines first shady deal Pfizer. Stealing vaccines EU Canada, paid upfront invested development.

Next time, Israel wait common queue.

Very. Long. Queue.

Do really think, see numbers? know Israel signed contract? No. forget. dont know wealthy parents sending kids school parents need work sending kids schools. 100 percent adults. Fuck covid. 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! perma banned r/politics saying military personal went capitol insurrection court marshalled given death penalty.

Apparently that's inciting violence despite fact death penalty literally legal punishment sedition military.

EDIT CLARIFY: mean people breached building. No. government forcing them, could would make merry hell it.

More likely money. Prices different AstraZeneca vaccine. Thought around £3 jab, Pfizer £15. doubt planned source EU EU factories start shipping UK cost them. Especially speculated EU cheaper deal. beautiful sight behold.

Indeed. compelling data 1 dose provides approximately 80% efficacy among elders mobidity factors (80% vaccinated, 33 331 40 000) healthcare workers (approximately 50% vaccinated, 172 979 320 000) reduced number deaths among elders Quebec.

Source (in French): good early (like 12 mo ago) correctly pointed would go global.

Now? He’s lost plot. shame. That’s kinda mean guess. Like theory 70 percent vaccinated probability would decrease lot imagine. I’m probably using wrong technical language describe mean. epidemiologist Guys, stop downvoting people ask questions! 

It's better respond answer question others informed.

And can't answer question perhaps that's problem! "" "" okay keep scrolling. would great changed one dose approach much later.
Every one goes variants people unvaccinated?
Far likely new variant develop someone who's unvaccinated someone is. He's nuts. France vaccinated 3.6% citizens one dose. vaccines give away.

Also, Macron's fake news anti-vax comments AZ vaccine, calling ""quasi-effective"" hours European regulator EMA approved it, holding back take vaccinations France.

I honestly think he's got mental problems. teen groomed 40-year old teacher married age 18, see mental problems come power imbalance - he's constantly trying attract attention though prove important reverse sub feeling must teen. Hopefully people remember 2020-2021 learn next time (even outcome looking quite grim) “Economic impact lockdowns”

“Mental health impact lockdowns” Again, making huge jumps. guy exist? jumping place discredit article every possible thing could happened, based absolutely nothing.. weird. Wealthier people NYC sending kids school still. So, anything, education inequality going grow, people enough money managed avoid gap children's education.  100% 

The finer details confident abilities we! keep seeing people say zero covid working Australia New Zealand ask, really? 

The fact countries lockdown time case two pops unknown origin tells lockdowns can't work virus unless want rolling lockdowns forever.

Are going force entire populations take vaccine? not, virus pop back anti-vaxx community back lockdown.

How rejoin world community zero covid strategy? can't possibly make tourists quarantine 14 days expect tourism economies roll on.

All questions even addressing much freedom people willing give security. think want national government capable shutting everything hours notice.

In beginning thought right idea think it, countries like Sweden US's national lockdown plan right idea. Let localities decide need lockdown protect hospital capacity. Another question I’ve aren’t places open 24 hours? It’s way logical people trickling throughout day/night rather force everyone pile time certain hours. sister issues stomach many missed days, schools start harassing parents arrest neglect on.

But take maths example:

If I'm school unable solve problem ask teacher take look it, maybe missed x used rule wrong way. took 30 seconds time one bothered. 

The issue home would require draw problem google meets paint whatever ask teacher look it. 

Takes like 5-10 minutes everyone meet gets blasted conversation want hear.

Plus we're finding samples showing somewhere mid late November, likely means community spread already play, especially since we've found samples late November early December range Europe people without travel history. Even factor cases asymptomatic/mild.

Not saying China make big mistakes. ultimately stoked fire already lit. soon cat bag late. Europe actually responsible seeding world virus early months pandemic. China/Asia likely source point (likely crossed humans October November). CCP trustworthy all, science tells us already community spread outside Asia people knew existed. pandemic going happen either way. blame China upfront exacerbating situation, like speaking mid late December would stopped virus made least two continents prior (Europe &amp; South America).

 Ehh yes no. I’m teacher poor zip code big east coast city. Attendance directly correlated learning. teach aged high school students like 17-20 years old. never gone school consistently, mostly due rough home lives. also 2nd-4th grade reading levels. analyze even basic reading passages nearly impossible. students try come school every day actually learn something comes twice week less, usually don’t make it. Virtual learning year brutal. person 400 students roll, usually 50-60% show daily. Virtually? Maybe 30-40% show up. Sadly due school we’ve lost 6 kids due fun violence past 8 months. that’s one school. Imagine schools area many kids we’ve lost gangs violence.

I think school provides structure kids need, discipline, people care course two free meals. Every kid different course. one two brilliant kids could skip every day work, truly handful kids.

If post something Russia Today praising vaccines point definitely raised. Even article perhaps correct Okay I’m talking transmission vaccinated people. know yet vaccinated people transmit virus themselves. said correct discussed, people trials vaccinated around not.

The person said “Transmission possible second dose” like said, confirmed yet. Brunswick County North Carolina. Schools still open. recently, 3 days ago, select schools closed COVID outbreak. think Brunswick County administration wreckless. schools dont trust students self learn. general rule students go class, likely learn get better grades stupid presumption, class waste time productive read textbook home. announced **licensing** agreement Oxford University AstraZeneca May. funding comes **Oxford University** today agrees global **licensing agreement** **AstraZeneca**, UK-based pharmaceutical company, commercialisation manufacturing potential vaccine.

The deal UK AZ second (future) agreement, undated ling provided. took 28. August 2020 means that, Oxford vaccine successful, AstraZeneca work make 30 million doses available September people UK, part **an agreement** deliver 100 million doses total. Well, expecting more. Transmission definitely still possible vaccination. trials several vaccinated people became sick covid. 

The likelihood reduced still possible close contact high risk person still reasonable. Exactly :( insanely sick elementary school even parents working full time family 5 lived two bedroom apartment. remember left home alone 5 year old parents literally could afford miss work weak get bed entire week (they called every hour everything could would come home lunch breaks neglectful desperate) US still losing 2.5x per capita Israel per day. UK built decent amount, start last year pretty much vaccine production. 


We're currently set produce majority components 3 vaccines. AZ, Novavax Valvena. experts. manufacturer. 

Oh, btw, despite completely made headline, manufacturer still criticizes policy warns it. 

Which likely “your side” resort dishonest tactics like lying Pfizer reversing advice. ""Good News"" lmao. people don’t want AZ vaccine absolutely sure. needed equation beat virus. Fact even delays facing, delivering doses example Moderna, alternative vaccines replace AZ vaccine short time. influenza vaccine works keeps people dying influenza. flu mutates quickly us make high percent effectiveness vaccine it. doesn’t mean doesn’t work.

20% children infecting adults significant number. It’s major spreading phenomenon, it’s rather mathematically ignorant say 20% population insignificant.

And far mRNA vaccines go, I’ve heard plenty people smarter subject talk good understanding mRNA vaccines worry. understand mechanisms. haven’t deployed doesn’t automatically make dangerous. burden proof people claiming could dangerous. like said, neither us experts, I’ll leave vaccine experts tell whether vaccine safe. saying is, I’m good.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *Due lockdowns Israel far fewer total case % population indicated death count (US lost 100 times people 35 times population) there's natural immunity now.

Cases per capita pretty poor metric function spread testing. US twice cases per capita many tests per capita testing showcase that.

US deaths still 2.5x Israeli deaths per capita. absolutely crucial reduce hospitalization death.

Many people simply dont want vaccine, wuite sure that. majority K-12 students fine staying home regular cold. Yes can’t, majority problem. gamble UK taken. Looks like it’ll pay off. lot people travel important enough feel like neccessary pandemic.

Let rich get killed. time take care other. need us way need them. Correlation equal causation Hmmm sure.  I’m particularly thinking countries making comment.  yes,  could lot worse scenario, could better one well.  However, I’m current scenario making statement.. 🤷‍♀️ Cases fallen 50% keep falling (dropped daily average 8k day rolling average 4k), deaths slightly behind, also fallen 40%. worked small hospital ER said use pto it’s gone maybe someone donate you. Went work for. Different hospital wife caught Covid place sent home paid leave 2 weeks sent sick kids school work wouldn’t provide many family home ‘sick’ days.

Otherwise, take personal days. paid. booking trip year half advance. Before, knowing would happen.

So. Now, get spend time sick kids lose money saved up, vacation cannot afford. Studies suggest 100% protection hospitalization death. much better alternative, waiting months deliveries mRNA vaccines. Look, get reasons send kids school pandemic, agree lot them, simple, two pretty strong reasons send them:

1. Online class simply good person, regardless age, especially younger kids.

2. lot students parents work, kid suddenly stay home, means parent longer work, least find baby sitter. lot families isnt sustainable.

Now anyone says things like ""online class better class died,"" obviously thats case. Ive seen, lot parents work sending children day care, cuz many still open. kids actually seeing *more* people allowed go school normally. least school somewhat enforce safety procedures.

Bottom line: black white, im sick people pretending is. Im glad im school administration cuz dont envy people make decisions. Nobody called UK plague island. We're watching interest concern. like Brexit Sequel. OK. Quite apart might mean covid, fascinating. Would idea latency persistence help explain chronic illnesses? example, considered possible cause ME/CFS? seems like potentially huge impact way think illness (or least ""we"" laypeople working science). good news? problem? value working illness

My workplace graciously said sickness absence reason ""Covid 19"" count towards maximum allowable 11 sick days 12 month period. everything else still does. seasonal flu knocks 2 weeks, better bloody sure (had) perfect attendance TWO YEARS surrounding flu (12mo after). Otherwise getting harassed HR. better sick leave policy worked retail, saying something. school went 9/day 229 yesterday, still refuse call frats partying. saga started last year AZ kept lying dodgy test results. time, everybody still wanted believe ""Oxford vaccine frontrunner"" spread British media worldwide. Yeah, pretty much. February europe access better information ground compared china new years Eve.

Plentiful countries, many neighbors china handled pandemic well, nowhere stage US, EU, Brazil.

Covid countries magically less dangerous others places. better decision making. 

Lying willingly bad, rest world cannot pin shot show china. tools enough data take better decisions February. even July. are, one year after, still deal covid daily, many countries fine. 

The duty protecting citizens ultimate solely elected officials one else, leadership US/EU clearly failled, repeatedly. true February, true along 2020, still true today. It’ll certainly make effects less deadly though 

The BBC ran story guy 30s ICU Covid. morbidly obese looked 50. ate healthier lost weight wouldn’t bad 

It may spread less would kill less fever, exhaustion, muscle joint aches 3 days 2nd dose. rough!

Get 2nd dose, prepared. Bring on! :D

I want dose vaccine man :(

How many young americans already vaccinated though? guys going ""first-come-first-serve"" route or? got downvoted it’s stupid question. majority world vaccine high efficacy offers significant protection severe cases death. yes, exception South Africa vaccine provide significant relief.

I know focus article childhood education, dang whole system broken childhood education high school college working job. legitamently go doctor sooner could get appointment class want miss. Health always come school apparently society agree. Wow sound like wonderful parent. I’m second semester senior high school already accepted dream college parents won’t let miss minute school even takes huge toll mental health. wish understanding you! senior got pulled principal’s office I’d many (excused) absences. sick lot year, don’t remember many days wasn’t crazy amount. AP classes, 3.95 GPA, headed college, sooooo worried attendance issues. much BS. Honestly, it’s pretty startling badly people treat kids think them.

I remember went period constantly sick pretty much everyone accused faking. least twice week would hours night terrible diarrhoea.

Only one single teacher school took seriously suggested might lactose intolerant getting sick drinking milk almost every day. Go figure fixed problem.

Not single person ever apologised admitted wrong assuming lying trying skip school. kid extremely well school reason fake sick. thank, I’m good - good new on, thank much 😅 quick reddit, bash guy students sue? lawyer sort bait switch thing seems like illegal... f keeps us closed much longer fighting recall election. know maybe show planet ape scene ceasar says ""NOOOOh"" first time. pandemic taught quite lot actually. thing point really conditioned are, molded fit working class society. one things I've noticed. Adding working home dependent technology. Ig intention prevent truancy effects weren’t good Yeah, comparing risks, I'm saying Covid-19 vaccines definitely absolutely long term side effects (though probably won't). let's suppose someone least interested could happen Covid-19 vaccine recipients road. question still remains, ""well, exactly think might happen?""

I've never gotten answer beyond vague ""something bad"". 

We *know* short term, Covid-19 kills people. *know* Covid-19 cause lasting complications. *know* vaccines work effective Covid-19. available Covid-19 vaccines also undergone testing, millions people vaccines administered, there's zero evidence vaccines worse virus. 

So far vaccine fears concerned, *exactly* bad thing that's supposed happen people get vaccinated? Based know Covid-19 available vaccines, need something ""something bad."" concerns *specific* side effects vaccines, stuff could conceivably tested and/or debunked? otherwise I'm really seeing people failing avoid *known* effects Covid-19 they're afraid *vague, unspecific, non-falsifiable* threat vaccines.

From risk-avoidance standpoint, make much sense me. vaccine skeptics least *specific* fears? Explain *precisely* they're concerned about, talk concerns scientific manner debunk/validate fears appropriate? otherwise, seems make whole lot sense take damn vaccines. would much rather things open masking requirement close things longer without one. shame can't rely broad compliance non-invasive preventative measure. I'm sure lot people forget Covid years pandemic ends start again. Parents still sending sick kids school. 

It’s easier take day work hope kid doesn’t get sent home.

I’ve seen it. Nice. still voting recall Newsom though.  like seeing businesses close people lose jobs /s oldest son first grade, happened dropping something front office school. mother waiting son. taken school -- sick -- could marked ""on time"" day took home. could perfect attendance award end year. Fair enough. Think looking comment looking number times used word ""I"" framed everything terms impacts you. wants everything opened ASAP too, hope things keep improving way open things possible, personally, I'd rather things open masks closed without them. give scale ""really bad"" human health? People sit next laser printers day, ozone smell emit. bad breathe poison, nobody suggesting using occupied rooms (except Asia, widely used).

I already know scale ""very long half life"" - 30 minutes. could use airplane subway car leave couple hours would dissipated. obviously much faster way would ventilate fan.

I understand people henpeck much unconventional solution (obviously injecting bleach *foolish*). Ionic cleaners extremely good cleaning air they're dirt cheap part conversation 1) there's research specificlaly virus, 2) emit ozone \[if they're badly designed cleaned long time, they're designed emit ozone\]. Misleading headline. We're extreme capitalist society values money else. highest reported death rates. lots poor countries testing capabilities may underreporting dictator want lose grip populace. Yes Cool. mask still coming enough time passed following two doses. Twitter? That’s funny, don’t Twitter. So, gonna rescind part wrong tried say instruction manuals wasn’t cycle numbers? happened kid’s class. Turns kid’s mom teacher. go in, kid too. widowed mother one available help watch kid. sad seeing awards given scenario! constantly withholding information. expert trying make plain statements non-experts. That's works. Actually, every 6/9 weeks many schools like extra recess ice cream party ect perfect attendance since can’t get STAAR endorsements// money don’t X amount attendance %. kids schools worked perfect attendance end year got giant rewards/ activities, school got x amount attendance would like big inflatable water slides. Weekly grade would get award door class best attendance. one many ridiculous things teaching mad put with. principals would call never would sit people list kids tell us get back school, call parents. Request try there. Every year STAAR usually group kids literally active temps coughing teachers come test, finish leave school finish. Schools also get paid many butts chairs kid day attendance. don’t give crap leave nurse send kids back fast walk in. 

They don’t even send kids home active visible lice infestation, r ring worm let whole grade get it. “Learning important” doubt family feels same. think ""underrated"" vaccine -- going fantastic choice healthy essential workers.

Most states still working 65+ medical workers/first responders — co-morbid conditions gets prioritized essential workers, continue deploying mRNA high risk people ramp production mid-Spring.

With one, businesses could even traditional vaccine clinics workers using one since it’s single shot requires refrigeration rather deep freezing. agree hard teach since parents may able tell sick kid feels unless really young. always allowed stay home really felt needed (but mom let stay home alone turned 8 parents aren’t cool with) mom would always keep home spewing fluids fever even wanted go school. missed field day one year fever. think logic extended symptoms easily spread things like excessive coughing sneezing stopped medicine. took cold medicine get school day cold way many times high school missing AP classes would stress much I’d feel even worse. I’m pretty considerate person didn’t really think getting kids sick far knew thing. idea needs change. hope young kids right get idea getting people sick big deal it’s okay. sure gonna try hold onto lesson over. Totally agree balance think emphasis taken preventing spread illness even don’t feel bad. won’t pay. dislike masks find dehumanizing. like see people's faces. hard understand people talking (especially wearing two). find two masks even uncomfortable wear pull ears, end wicked headache. (So, admit wear two often). said, dutifully wear mask vaccinated. that, though, mask coming going trash. Really wish could making tons vaccine since last year... is. Better nothing... post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I'm programmer, really reason work home, management prefers. Wearing KN95 hours day shit better covid. Yep, point vaccinations get point open societies economies again, completely agree you. want see schools open, gyms open, home gatherings, restaurants open, vacations happening, bars open, etc. want it. 

Wearing mask indoors? means stops spread much much sooner, I'm it. whole anti-lockdown argument premised around economic/educational impacts lockdowns, I'm onboard. Let's open soon possible - broad mask wearing makes come sooner.

Masks still one main tools prevent virus spread, given minimal impacts economy/education, one last things lift - words, lift restrictions SOONER given we're still masking, course assuming broad compliance. It’s opposite, least state. first group medical staff, etc. second group essential workers. Teachers second group rolled out, they’ve bumped place people smoke. they’re limbo everyone else, behind essential workers. Good third group one letting first group stay home year. holidays + vaccine roll that's pushing entire US good direction.

I hopeful May/June we'll talking reopening things normal levels turning 21 days 🥲 woman right whatever wants body without risk getting fired happened 2 close friends, 28 30 years old. mom mild case long haul symptoms too, she’s 55. I’ve also seen younger folks speak social media people know loosely. know ppl say everything true social media know long haulers ignored dismissed media governments, so. 50 considered low feeling side effects generally nothing worry about. personally brought doctor since would feel heart rate dropped low. substantial weight loss caused body still adjusting. keep mind. Military folks walks life throughout US (and occasionally beyond). such, opinions stuff likely going reflect rest country.

And thousands literally small %. 

Only difference point, FDA approves fully, likely mandatory whether want not.

But yes, demand still way higher supply military too, reason POTUS override approval requirement. sense mandating vaccine can't provide. You’re seriously going compare COVID flu 2021 half-million Americans dead less 12 months? You’re dangerously delusional giving anyone advice. traveling global pandemic another option. said thing în another post down-voted oblivion. Maybe worded poorly smth, also think limited supply vaccines bad idea vaccinate teachers returning classes instead vulnerable People.

People hear ""But teachers"" turn brains.

How focus what's right children? Stockholm low population density?? similar population density Berlin large European cities? much dense neighbours density within cities? trying use whole countries density opinion would pretty dishonest. 130 countries anything developing vaccine? No? quit bitching Man, PA getting another 5-8 inches snow tomorrow. Last year measurable snow fall... 40 year old, assure perfectly reasonable. people daily thread nuts, suspect quite young. nuts college too. Don’t let bother you. agree. theory already hit poeple weaker immune systems frequent risky behavior, rest less likely get and/or asymptomatic. irresponsible. Please try convince talk doctor concerns.  mask protect you. Enough alarmism Works? Apparently took *twelve years* full time study learn show work behave appropriately around coworkers.  And....? think every parent reckless you? railed hard perfect attendance policies local district. They’re INSANE public health perspective hope never come back. Vitamin part Well, mean...

* person right body vaccinations medications take.
* business freedom fire person found person suitable business.

It simply clashing interests. mean, seen information says. says we're getting 11M doses week. swings 1.6M doses day due excess supply past two months. 

So show article says we're receiving 11M doses week, supply limited many vaccine doses give... Teacher Texas here. school funding partially based attendance. school day exact time announcement stop take attendance. snapshot used record schools eligibility funding. crazy. removed one preventative measure (among many) school system returned August. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

America leads way science. lot lower hanging fruit essential workers buddy. think lot missing study. Baldness today's age somewhat mitigated least slowed, may mean looking socioeconomic issue considering treatments require money (sometimes considerable amounts). many factors may speed mitigate progression baldness factors may reason COVID. also see chart severity, testing positive.

This missing lot honestly headline anything informative. it’s one other, options (and realistic options), slightly better good enough now. doesn’t mean stop representing people. derive mandate people voted in, decide hold higher standards office would campaigning Trump. 

These two wildly different scenarios qualifications make strong statement childhood development? memory loss. double standard. either federal state. change one favorite game. Right here. Right now. What's quote random ""mom four"" article? cares completely unqualified uneducated person street trust vaccine?

There's two doctors quoted article. mom quote nonsense. useless? district can't reopen safely lacks resources, perhaps reopen.

I money buy safe skydiving kit. mean skydiving regulations useless, means skydiving. Lol remember around 10 11 years old, sick literally collapsed hallway house, mom convinced faking it. Well sure enough, forces school minute sat class teacher asked feeling alright, obviously said &amp; sent main office. temp like 103 104°F staff couldn’t believe parents actually allowed come in. Long story short, parents ones instilling idea “work you’re dead.” sick child parents valued education physical health. It’s culture change needs happen. right line behind healthcare workers. never understood weren’t.  Nothing like good ol shot peanut butter butt. Still remember 17 years later. Never forget. comments seem way distracting people much COVAX dragged feet everything. can't follow precautions reopen. problem I'm seeing many places schools followed precautions teacher unions still saying teachers must vaccinated even small number needy students re-enter school receive accessible education. lucky China recognized virus Li tried warn fellow medics disease looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus.

But told police ""stop making false comments"" investigated ""spreading rumours"". That’s want; food servers lied vaccinated potentially fatal contagion. places (like germany) even harder restrictions first time way longer. snarky comment involving trump's shitty hair ffs time put rest. Well, world imperfect place, unfortunately. know wildly accepted truth. people paid vaccines want them. That's works trade ownership. time comes countries want donate them, will. 

Now countries paid vaccines, that's different story. Indeed. practical move avoid kind discussions. ""wake lion"". 3.7 million teachers US, theye averaging 1.7 million vaccine doses per day.

Could declare tomorrow ""National Teachers Get Vaccinated Day"", vaccinate one teachers, done it

They want teachers die did? thought AZ... 100,000+ Americans died road last 3 years. getting car ""not smart""? 100,000+ Americans died road last 3 years. getting car ""not smart""? That’s whole point. You’re supposed leave. believe ""my body, choice"" would foolish choose join armed services. sign, becomes ""their body, choice"". Yeah eligible NY. still enough supply though. Teachers literally home since March, want priority vaccinations, over, say, grocery workers, people frontline? No, teacher unions bought paid Biden admin, governors, city supervisors hold children hostage get way, i.e. Los Angeles Chicago teacher unions. dont need vaccinations, need get complacent asses get back work like rest us oh makes sense don’t see many people saying this. Seems like saying keep schools closed couple months. wants schools open teachers get vaccinated? Oh, well that’s smart.... definitive metric, also definitive sunset regardless. discussions unfortunately take place static backdrop, restrictions mounting costs decreasing benefits time, arena decision making *cannot* simply constitute covid outcomes. Yea, put bunch landscaping around pool. looks MUCH nicer instead grass concrete lol. remember America two densely populated regions vast swathes farmland desert between. Europe evenly dotted cities countryside. current vaccines require cooling capabilities many hospitals super abundance, need prior now. get Johnson Johnson's easier store transport vaccine, I'm hoping pharmacies Midwest give like crazy. there, excess quickly go Canada Mexico (like 90% Canada's population lives within hours' drive US border). good simplified summary caveat vivo may work differently, cell responses may still work well too. 

It's concerning mostly hints easily could variants avoid immunity even greater degree, gotten big enough foothold pop limited radar yet. surveillance picks hopefully spot them. would terrible wait many months boosters distributed another variant voids immunity sweeps world learn mistakes fast enough. Hopefully vaxx people quick enough avoid scenario  short term memory loss states know / getting shipments previous administration screwing around lies conspiracy theories? hell lot easier manage vaccine distribution know coming much. 

Gotit

It hard right/left whatever acknowledge pick crap job. difference feeling well actually sick. times feel well often due anything infectious. actually sick fever, vomiting, excessively sneezing/coughing, diarrhea come school/work. Nothing makes mad people coming office visibly sick hacking lung. employer generous enough give plenty sick days, use them. guess see difference administration deciding die deciding who's important, Trump gave instructions die followed brain damaged thinking. canceled large events really ""intrusive""? Masks something intrude every time one goes public. suppose life invested large events might case, seems pretty subjective. helps plan take in-person class June (and fact removed option yet good sign suppose) looks like limited capacity. sure mask situation be. vaccinations available public large August I'm sure in-person classes would canceled fall. even though eligible mean even get it. dad school bus driver NY still can't get appointment get first dose. Making vaccine mandatory point plain dumb enough supply right now. ~51% 14 days first dose 80% 28 days first dose (see Table 15 linked FDA/Moderna document think point broad lacking nuance. There’s 1000s reasons different countries fair better worse.

But entertain implied point. Comes culture better worse. Unless idea rapidly reprogram enough brains undo entire culture enough lockdowns ever work, you’re shit luck. scientists ran trial say take shots, that's approved for. parents' judgement misguided. Complete garbage.

AZ’s trialing showed much, much lower antibody responses SA variant. necessary amount needed neutralize. Also worth noting mRNA vaccines significantly effective wild type AZ’s vaccine ever Yeah goes say husband considering trying start family. isn’t pregnant thinking trying. Yep, COVID vaccine roll-out NYS marginal, rural New Yorkers drive 3+ hours receive vaccine state sites. 

The online sign-up process abysmal too; pharmacies sign-up separate state sign-up--bodes well seniors...... worries! Like spread good news I've done nothing since last year, work sales open whole time. can't risk day. bet backyard looks amazing! post photos spring. love gardening etc can't wait! Novavax get approved, hopefully one smoother production distribution. Wish could said anthrax vaccine. shocked even choice. Unfortunately that’s going one things continuously adjusted can’t really put deadline virus. agree need definitive metric “zero covid” isn’t exactly realistic. likely FDA full approval. probably not. kid catches classmate, brings home, parents get sick, miss work, get fired family can’t eat keep roof head. really dense?

The US order earlier paid right manufacture vaccine distribute locally first. 

The EU decided cheap possible agreed distribute vaccines outside Europe exchange cheaper price. 

If hiccups may worked EU, issues (of course) EU bit screwed. 

The EU realized much screwed decide threaten export ban, completely screwing countries waiting. 

Only realizing could never enforce ban without cut important imports themselves, change course. 

They decide start propaganda EU “caring willing share world” lol complete utter rubbish. talking two studies led one. Well, hand washing staying home you’re sick always kind thing. Mostly. Hopefully. meant masks lot less disruptive every event ever cancelled, capacity caps, remote learning 2020 goodness. 

But yeah, it’s absolutely question live. you’re in, say, LA County, expect wearing mask rest year tbh. reasoning? like shots? would think want protected possible. really can't imagine anyone would it.

Wanting help take part trial science one thing. isolating 17 days injected virus like covid? thanks. unless I'm getting £4.5k it. Moderna 2 days ago. Hours 12 36 rough. feel better now, swollen painless arm Yes. heard teachers refusing go back classroom they're vaccinated. Oh doubt month two definitely receded. last two days declining 20 percent probably snow storms. pops back 90k flatlines days variants taking hold, probably people going getting tested. guess Operation Warp Speed Biden's idea, LOL. /s No. might experiencing pain discomfort normal side effect getting shot making behave unreasonably. avoid reinfection. (possibly - hopefully) make harder transfer others exposed again. (again hopefully) increase immunity COVID variants. ...they make deals people think covid hoax, masks anti-freedom, Trump stable genius god-king..... 

its freaking hostage negotiation thats horrific believe scene Idiocracy. +72 million ""patriots..."" cdc guidelines state 4 days early ok. know man, sounds soul-crushing me. love job always thinking genuinely something love. worry kind people want punch clock, seems spirit-killing.

Edit: trying make feel bad, describing sounds like absolute last person would want hire. sound like someone going beyond bringing creativity extra skills table. that.

Yes, I'm scared, shit's scary! That's really frustrating. One thing difficult district different ability vaccinate teachers, follow protocols. Unfortunately, think seeing districts reasonably open limited number special needs students open time seeing districts cannot follow guidance open way. lot people getting screwed devastating.

One frustrations parent child special needs teachers county whole keep saying ""we job kids learning. go back?"" illustrates perfectly. job best virtual learning accessible daughter despite us paying shit load money random aide come home every day facilitate learning her. specific situation, school system asked teachers take absolutely risk face evidence risk low, keeping job can't (not fault), pay $1000/month also take risk stranger come house every day.

I love teachers. really do. situation nuanced requires careful critical thought, seen lot side. Yes. brother got November still brain fog. crazy think 4 months later still symptoms easy thing highly effective. save click- article mention anything X-Men. Maybe been. one said cultural, me. 

Furthermore, great cultural differences say Thailand China. Putting one boat wrong. Unlikely exactly? reason Pfizer said due fact think 6 weeks maximum best, due fact test anything outside range (to quicken approval process). Thus, morally, obligation recommend anything range tests. studies trying do. Weigh potential upsides downsides taking calculated risk something thoroughly tested peer reviewed. Nah, government contractor. Job sucked kept roof head food table. Thats anyone could ever ask for. high school thing don’t unexcused absences get void one finals. Right, nothing employment Yes. Tourism fucked everywhere. interesting... another study found mitochondrial DNA may indicator could risk severe Covid. Mitochondrial DNA passed mother, male pattern baldness also typically passed mothers side. Try time: Skip district go state level. Districts push attendance that's get funding. Irish company conducting study UK volunteers. exactly ""racism irish people""? complaining **not** deliberately infected coronavirus? Truthfully hard say certain. Factors would include:

* state in. Redder states lax, bluer states intense.
* Vaccination progress-- looking good USA, definitely.
* complications (not sure what).

I would hazard might 100% normal, would likely close: classes person, maybe fewer people maybe smaller. I'd say... unlikely. maybe Spring 2022. day still dreams missed many days can’t graduate. table shows 92% 14 days. 80% figure lower includes 1 14 day period. updates AZ sa variant yet? look long covid sub, occasionally post symptoms clear start taking anti anxiety meds. 

Funny works Anyone information transmission rates sputnik v? purposes proving paranoid roommate no, still able infect second dose. reads like state throwing disabled people bus yet again. 

The 65+ highest participation rates election, politicians favoring yet scummy unsurprising. Schools opening San diego still. Correlated yes there's still gene causes it. knew couple kids highschool losing hair sure enough mom's dads bald AF. definitely genetic, family weirdly low percent people lose hair Baumol mostly. Well someone functioning business, I'd say frankly sounds like something wrong anyway attitude. Isn’t people like constantly advocate for? one wants go we’re going obviously there’s going losses sides. Kids school online much better someone losing life Call crazy think they'll get electricity running water first. thought AOC already got skipped elderly. Vaccinate grocery store workers admit it, hate Trump refuse give ounce credit. anything goes wrong fault. anything happened January 20th longer President's fault- state's responsibility. Got it. It’s Ventilation. Even without perfect herd immunity, rate spread low enough first enable hospitals sufficient resources treat cases without overwhelming system, vaccinating vulnerable age groups pre-existing health condition folk bring severe cases mortality, make manageable endemic health issue without turn lock downs shutting much daily economic social activities. 

If reduce covid’s impact way level actual flu, place us much better spot reopen engage normal activity. 

I don’t think it’s realistic shoot absolute eradication short (1-2yr) term normalize life global scale. Kiwi again, good job. Immune Fuel dummos twitter work kids first time like 6 years I've made whole winter without single cold! Usually I'm sick mid september november... We've really strict kids coming sick great. teachers playing ""the game"" perfectly.

Cut line vaccinations. early May 100% get shots ""fully protected.""

At point, narrative changes ""well, school year almost anyway. go back now? Let's wait next fall."" mandate approved vaccines administered billions times proven safe decades use neither covid-19 vaccine is. manager decided get pregnant last year. thought idiot before, evidence.

I’m looking forward taking maternity leave. Exactly, double standards getting old already. Anytime went wrong January 20th, ""ITS TRUMP'S FAULT!"" Anytime goes wrong January 20th ""Its states fault!"" I’ve working person since August. severe sped classrooms population immunity infection (rather vaccination) likely confers little protection new strains. means it'll run previously infected like wildfire since many seem think they're immune now. Found guy clearly run business. see lawyer dropping evidence making everything up? Dear god, please spend time looking tiny details Blasey Fords accusation, evidence therein. comical.

my mom works private school, closed single day

she get first shot though thank goodness

I think entire family educators get priority though. dad &amp; brother live her. gets school, obviously bringing back &amp; dad diabetic think rationing still EUA. fully approved yes, would mandatory.

I'm grateful anyone's getting vaccinated. bitter angry order perfect waste energy. obese start protecting elements, I'm telling Texans take clothes cold. read that? Chancellor's (CSU) Regents (UC) announced in-person class upcoming school year *despite* faculty vaccinated, news professors unions (since announced via LATimes rather bargaining table). EU question Russia exporting vaccine? expect Russia vaccine nationalists? see masks mandates changing get widespread vaccinations Probably China. 🙋🏻‍♂️  I'm packing getting ready next pandemic. think backwards.

18% administered least one shot? Why? think there’s little chance school ends. kids school wearing masks, since won’t vaccinated near future, think mask wearing norm least June. Oh damn that's definitely delay. thought read something needing 2nd dose within 42 days I'd double check that. always thought business/commercial transactions. Countries order vaccines different companies, companies fulfill orders. country places order first, logically get shipment first, regardless factory vaccines got shipped from.

Why turning political issue? Even worse, fighting among traditional allies. think it’s well years. Within months probably Impersonating federal agent felony, right? two felons. Got get clicks. like teachers alone classroom though –– there's also students. teachers may protected, hybrid schedules allow distancing procedures like spacing protect transmission students, whose caregivers likely yet vaccinated. Likewise, teachers need time work students chosen fully remote. district, elementary schools moving two four days person next month given distancing seems possible faculty vaccinated (and note lobbied teachers, administration), five days without sacrificing support fully-remote kids. expect districts may dire situation resources make five days possible even teachers fully vaccinated. Nah. Let someone ban instead. wear mask whine them, human scum. Cases Canada plummeting mandatory stay home order province houses 1/2 citizens. Canada makes sense PH interventions driving decline.

The US that. US’s approach covid has, best knowledge, changed since November. 

I think it’s tale two stories. Canada, decline attributed lockdowns. US, decline attributed vaccines + natural immunity. 19 y/o boi here, thoughts, head empty, want back college, want physical hugging :( need weekend away house Seeing faces part human. person locations school? Like school? I’m pretty sure it’s them, that’s work culture America I’m sure parts world well. again, I’m saying, it’s short sighted try make hard rule happen teachers vaccinated, virus constantly evolving every infection shit could take turn worse. again, yes. variant current vaccines less effective against, it’s already happened. happen long virus spreads freely communities. get want kids go back school, too. don’t want kill people make happen merely months away vaccines available everyone, chance halting community spread throw gasoline fire opening schools. states gotten better administering it, federal government gotten better distributing companies gotten better production. need get past pesky uber winter see things really skyrocket... 100% political point, know vaccine good now, Navalny jail relations Russia EU worsened since then. *Decent*  much optimistic now. difference year makes. certain areas strong anti-mask sentiment, wearing mask harms society forms clothes. Sorry buy number, 3 3 adults impacted mentally covid, two showing it. 2 fucking paying attention. worked leaving California Exactly everyone 65 gets Vaccine free rain point. I'm moving Florida lol. sure severe infection long term consequences? Yeah, think either while. high crime areas years mask bans likely make come back. probably two points related Vaccination you, effects everyone around you, yes people right isolate anti vaxxers away society. hope apply rules schools flights well. Well, consider roughly year ago thought mRNA vaccines could effective coronavirus developed, tested ready deploy within year sounded entirely unrealistic, think 'insanely hard do' within wheelhouse. doubt many keep them. Let's see happens actually get vaccinated. surprised bait switch get vaccinated new demand. I’m dark place, feels like there’s end sight. There’s nothing hopeful about. 2021 far basically 2020 2.0. see articles everyone depressed people suffering, what’s solution? 

I take consolation there's like 5 vaccines approved nearing approval working get distributed. far better 2020 see end. different SEE it; know close is... see coming. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

We know covid sucks hate “wear mask.” Something “your” gives energy “cover shoulders” “fix uniform.” 

(Disclaimer: recognize current importance masking wear one every day) depressed virus. depressed overreach lockdowns. Yeah, fifteen years exactly enough. Maybe she'll see now. Great idea! think that.... someone physically healthy, ok deal mental health issues? physical mental health important. black white. People need right themselves, even means things give sense normalcy. Especially suffering. 

Don't light fire keep others warm. Amen brother. idea need keep schools closed protect kids back-assward don’t know start. Covid extremely low risk kids. going school bad kids, especially among vulnerable population. Cases US plummeting despite middle winter. doesn’t make sense suggest vaccines aren’t playing major role

Cases Canada currently plummeting well, yet far behind US vaccination rates.

It’s likely something else. instead conducted lab tests enginnered virus looks similar SA variant. found lower efficacy

Really? Let's see authors say Dormitzer, one Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists co-author study, said interview believes **the current vaccine highly likely still protect concerning variant first discovered South Africa**.  level neutralizing antibodies may order third half level neutralizing antibodies see original virus mean third half protection level, **you may well full protection,**” said.

About reasons primarily think means we’re going need change vaccine,” said. “It’s primarily learn change strain, terms manufacturing level, especially clinical results are.  variant comes along clinical evidence escape, we’re ready respond quickly,” Dormitzer Yeah, used make smile sort cute clever, like...damn, can't anything without constant reminders sides something wrong. Even people wearing masks around me, always mannequins statues advertisements.  Unlike UK US, EU far supported international cooperation rejected vaccine nationalism. History show EU right. Apparently is, pro-masks posts comment voted. bet people actually buy everything say Sure businesses allowed mask policies normal times. There’s mounting data suggesting COVID impact male fertility via sperm count.

There’s existing evidence RNA used improve sperm count.

That’s literally I’m going say here. Don’t argue anti-vax nuts, you’ll drive mad. specifically said unscientific opposite Yeah. Covid thing became kinda annoying. Kinda sucks. won’t experts tell us works. save lives end restrictions quicker. heard one person say ""JUST wear mask sick"" mask cure all. 

Really? I've seen tons comments places imply that. CDC actively promoted studies said mask mandates could replace lockdowns. Hell, even comments thread suggesting get flu levels wearing masks. It’s hard thing think many will. think educators ""lower"" priority? Can't valuable? Yes, meeting independent advisory baord approval likely come within couple days. Yep I'm mentally ill time last year, least get worse? Hooray, protective effect depression's numbness? Though gotta say SAD's little worse year able go friends. Y’all moderate way much. fine comment. Self-diagnosed. probably not. Neither get first. rich, old, gives f. trust government care you.

If guess, would something amount viral load exposed addition immune response. 

My symptoms: memory loss, day fatigue, chest pain, shortness breath, insomnia. 

Here’s it: don’t wish anyone. I’m not. one know wants virtual events replace person ones permanent masks. Shocking news - essential worker euphemism cannon fodder. literally made shit up, that's OK interview said scientific advisors. Wtf?   possible delusional?

Removing mandate active decision. sucks. Everyone whose working since started feels inclined shot. They’ve always stepped continue be. sad. Despite American? America top innovator producer pharmaceuticals world. Thank lucky stars US exists save shit like child Life easy US people create problems now. celebrate victim-hood weakness.

And all, context contacts: words, hand afterwards. 

If fomite transmission plausible risk vector, hand washing would necessary recommended prevention viral respiratory infections. yet...it is. Highly recommended. Why? That’s point. already recruit adults shouldn’t things said beginning. ""It ethical choice gambling health, life, also gambling lives others""

- Pope Francis I'm convinced ""give many people possible first dose"" always best strategy.

When shortage doses high level virus spread, best strategy. Quebec, still received enough doses start vaccinating able-bodied seniors live outside nursing homes, even they're 90 years old. vaccination ramp, period.

It is. Christmas/2022 date seems long it’s going take vaccinate everyone. Mortality mothers childbirth rising... Gulp, country 5% population first shot, UK variant spreading cluster African variant found apparent connection travel. 😬 Smh It’s really. think there’s certainly risk someone’s droplets landing surface, virus staying alive relatively small amount time, time touch touch mouth nose eyes become infected. occurrences like definitely driving majority spread. said, help also protects kinds germs too. type can't read?

Do voice text interface? again, insult still don’t even know said make argument me.

Also join military 17 second one. think lot issue many people want schools fully open instant first teachers get first dose. take time get everyone two doses antibodies build. could start vaccinating teachers today safely open six weeks so, that’s good enough lot people. want full person right regardless safety.

And say someone teaching school person months, yet state hasn’t even started vaccinating teachers. burned lot teachers’ good will, don’t feel safety matters parents, school boards, state leadership. penis (and extension, vagina) covered spreads disease, considered culturally socially indecent it’s taboo show public.

I'm 27, drink, smoke, drugs, exercise quite often. thing need change eating much sodium (which hard American). Germany. sure point is, though. Hospitalizations declining cases large rate. delivery Moderna, totaling around 100,000 doses, remains cold storage

Enough give every Palestinian 65 living territories first shot. feel like thinking country backwards. vaccinate everyone nursing homes first. Im trying insensative people nursing homes go lockdown away people. 

I say hit highest percetange age group spreader covid first. hit eveyone public job. course medical staff first responders go first well. Covid me. It’s tough, I’m grateful good job.

What's people constantly coming daily post rant rave people saying things never actually said? k It’s anti-vax setting dangerous precedent restricts bodily autonomy. 

It giving people choice, I’m personally also waiting vector vaccine released, don’t know long term effects rna-vaccine.

 Everyone also told us Contergan (Thalidomid) Safe medication pregnant women resulted cases Amelie (people born without limbs). Psychosomatic mean real.

I've experienced severe brain fog DPDR episodes, wholely unrelated (preceding...) COVID. also new term, ""time panic, sensationalism social media echo chambers attention seeking"" mean much. 

Funny enough, DPDR also entirely self-reported, physical otherwise testable symptoms, highly comorbid mental illness. Yet single psychologist would deny existence. stop fat lol. Great systemic approach public health. didn’t health experts possibly think this?  used significant amount Pfizer. cost key factor here, supply is. doses AZ available use better sitting waiting Pfizer. dick nose analogy all. It’s basically treating nose it’s genital, something never happen. every covid case actually replaced something can't see deaths would also going Taxes pay public schools though... 1 3? meant 16 2?

Eh?

Where BioNtech again? Yeah man. special education classes. Half person half Zoom.

It sucks. kids pretty incapable learning engaging format.

Really feels like treading water rather growing learning It’s pressure Cuomo. loosen up. genetic factors tho? That’s actually matters. know exists. good coping skills. Please use global crisis excuse look mental health ECMO semi-routine NICUs? Wait vaccine better 100% efficacy?

Fucking hell, really going good stuff! 2 anxious depressed coronavirus hit economy

Stay home, wear masm get may barred getting another vaccine booster years afterwards. shortages weird politics. $5000 heavy fine lot people millionaire.

I guess split yeah, gets better still. huge amount natural test metrics would score lower summer break though? People going forget lot summer since they're thinking school, permanent decrease. they've studying test scores go again, see spring test scores. gather end school year regression disappeared, since test scores go regression. anything shows temporary losses school pretty easily reversed. Unless think summer vacation, seem able handle kind issue pretty well.

About time school, impression schools US reopened either in-person hybrid amount time March now, continuous 18 months classes. Also, online class may good, equating completely school huge overstatement. percentage benefit regular school coming online hybrid classes, that's 100% also lot different 0. talk normalcy Christmas 20-fucking-22...just wow, absolutely unacceptable. vaccination ramp, period. actual fuck Biden talking about?

My worst fears coming true: He’s going drag way longer necessary show us “pro science” “his side” is.

This country beyond screwed. American society screwed up: mass media, mass hysteria, tribal politics.

I want pack move woods point. full-on societal collapse. total tragedy. hell schools (especially colleges) losing money tuition like 5-15k per person? wouldn’t read articles, important information clinical data. clinical data shows sit 40-50% first shot 95% 10 days second shot. 

After received first shot almost side effects. second shot felt like complete crap 48 hours. someone really 90% one shot doubt people would feel drastic side effects second shot. need set parameters measuring against.

AZ 100% efficacy severe disease hospitalisations ""normal"" covid.

What can't say, efficacy severe disease hospitalisations SA variant (which really matters), niether say efficacy vaccines this.

Saying *vastly* inferior incorrect.

But I'll wait goalposts put place actually see trying say. Hey making sure lol, good one   I'm exactly health anxiety absolutely beyond and. I'm worried others (family etc) becoming ill, myself, I've worried sorts non-covid related illnesses past year point extreme stress I'm all. logical don’t factor organ damage lol seriously believe vaccine 100% effective anything, especially without quoting proper clinical trial ?! \*spring change want keep jobs. Y’all weird realize global pandemic virus care borders? people vaccinate world better be. happened last summer, extended restrictions get past bank holiday..except bank holidays May, June August...so there's always day use excuse Hey feeling fully recovered covid &amp; still get shortness breath? know could drop pseudo scientific tier system... understand importance hand washing preventing spread bacteria disease, context covid (which understanding primarily spread droplets air respiratory virus), hand washing important? thought making shit up. Holy shit. tough year, despite challenges parenting pandemic remote learning that, got spend lot kids' childhoods would otherwise. schools going back days week end next month I'm getting shot may likely back work person soon and, honestly, I'm really going miss many ways. mask mandates local. state Virginia rules based cases hospitalizations state, rest country. federal mask mandates, besides Biden's federal land. Guys, don’t try argue somebody who’s mentally middle school username. don’t fight kids.

To u/yoogdadoog : Wut? “put kids buildings now” panic bad toilet paper panic March Dicks spread disease make babby, noses spread disease breathe airborne virus. Yep another explanation. think US ever reach 600,000 COVID-19 deaths? yes, when? Youre norm. envy guys lmao, Europeans I've got question:

I'm healthy 22 year old UK I've received invitation book Covid vaccine next week. assume chronic fatigue, record indicates chronic underlying health condition pushes priority rankings. However fatigue puts extra risk Covid technically priority.

I'm really date current UK vaccine situation is, would accepting vaccine deprive someone else needs more? therefore cancel booking? I'm currently uni (online course) really urgency get immunity. guys: doubtful. would get 'at will' termination conservatives love 'at will' termination. courts would tell pound sand. Seems posted wrong sub, mate. Israel offered Pfizer medical data sort large extended trial. 

That's true happened January, 4 million doses already delivered Israel December start January, doses Israel paid extra for.

The data doses possible unlike countries, Israel's distribution hit ground running, vaccinating 1.5% population day week program, US UK quite hit benchmark day (of course much smaller population helps lot). provide unique opportunity Pfizer, especially Israel vaccinating exclusively Pfizer already.  shit Nope. Open shut case favor employers states, matter politics. even make judge. cases auto-dismissed start seeing public service announcements saying employers fire legally refuse vaccine. Rooftop Koreans come back Hard disagree. go know works ton data showing works. don’t try something evidence think might works especially based limited data. Us great pace vaccinate especially given festering cases. anything fuck current trajectory wrong move. biggest mistake places like New York made strike iron hot. right, called kids back early, instead wasted 5 months low transmission. realize human brain takes well past 18 develop gain proper awareness mortality.

Out interest, what's minimum age joining armed forces country? Huh, why?  100% legal states. Every single employer legally fire refusing vaccine. makes difference degree approval. google - absolutely true. still takes weeks second shot sweet spot vaccine. hate masks believe best keep wearing reason still protect others going boat load people saying they've vaccine walking around maskless US masks cost twice much Chinese ones. know need domestic supply national public health I'm really surprised. Cases likely approaching summer levels midwest - account 3-4X testing going then. Stop jumping results study tiny amount data. low end 95 percent confidence interval 68 percent meaning it’s likely could significantly lower 93 percent. top ton real world data Israel showing two dose regimen highly effective. Throwing large scale data away study high degree uncertainty makes sense. nothing greed. complain clearly data emotional subjective believes. Yeah uh Amazon isn’t handling delicate vials stuff requiring constant monitoring ensure temp stays same. Amazon yet shipped nail polish didn’t break transit 😒 ain’t trusting vaccine vials. chocked. live Stockholm work clothing store whole families (kids, parents grandparents) visiting store. masks required enter store people rarely think social distancing. People literally come face asking help cough straight air.

I wished company work would take bigger responsibility us working also customers. feels disrespectful like we’re worth healty.

I one staff wearing mask, others thinks doesn’t fit face it’s hard breath.

Personally don’t really know think masks. mean use right way. Always washing hands put remove it. use maximum 2 hours never tuch it’s on. see many people using masks putting down, wearing nose tuching stuff wearing also seem reuse wear 2 hours. people using right don’t really know efficiently works. honestly seems way damage using wrong using one all. (Of course depends person’s situation) makes sense. agreed allowed outside exercise? Wtf u talking about? sound evil bitter. yeah get you’re saying. It’s like everyone bed ridden functioning. think everyone certain degree experiencing symptoms anxiety depression. think many able get past pandemic behind us  look forward hive mind. People think I'm weird that, thinking Borg nothing wrong. would foolish base decision study large confidence interval. Needs lot data switch current regiment talking thing Ontario (Canada)

W.T.F. think world start open lot sooner people think, especially touristy places. Half countries listed (seychelles, cyrprus, iceland) massively dependant tourist economy willing accept minor risk vaccinated foreigners order boost economy.

We're already seeing places like Thailand Spain set dates international travel open countries. Thailand plans let vaccinated October, without need quarantine. makes sense that's special tourist visa scheme ends.

This next 6 months going focused fully vaccine rollout, focus international travel imo Thanks! one verified epidemiologist list says speculation point:

There's difference sad miserable worried depressed anxious. average person, someone close dies, they're sad; they're depressed. people mourn person still get take care basic needs, perform work school tasks, muster shower put pants.

It's normal worried upset pandemic. impacts ability hold job perform well school healthy interactions family (even phone) depression anxiety. barely distribute internally across 50 states, hell think coordinate across 130 countries ensure equitable distribution? Well think goes without saying shouldn’t listening Boris Johnson advice public health. perhaps American society culture one best generating anxiety? mean crashing mountain bike could mean bankruptcy I'd anxious too. always perfect attendance kid... missed one day highschool Uncle's funeral history teacher took away attendance bonus points. FUNERAL. Glad mentality might change. Affirmative. Nope, necessarily want it, surprised worried happen. think idea behind articles let people know expected lots people nothing concerned with.


But everyone reacts differently it. know several people side effects all, fatigue another mildly sore arm. don’t sick time would rather use limited vacation time don’t feel best would like paid able use vacation vacations. CBA don’t follow state laws stuff would give us sick time. Working elements lot quite often get sick still go work. Okay, well visit, two babies climbed partner fully grown female sat close next could feel breath neck. 

There real risk infecting apes respiratory viruses. still taking tourist groups wouldn’t surprised gorillas infected. Also interesting, outside genetics, balding also occur Vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin deficiencies also lend severe cases COVID. would curious correlations there. drives nuts! school, 10.5 days parents go school attendance board. excused unexcused. remember high school boyfriend got RIDICULOUSLY sick sophomore year 2 weeks straight. Like, doctor said could go. dangerous others. mom go absence review board first 2 months school almost failed him. That's working vaccine version defend coronaviruses. You’re problem world OP it’s done limit damage.

And I'm contesting (though go uncontested; notion things listed anything ""limiting damage"" laughable).

I'm saying severely painful damage happening personal wellness massive numbers people, simply different far pernicious category harm ""30% country bad opinions"". school 70 days year school get funding. It’s corporate grooming I'm willing bet people making statements prioritizing countries get vaccines, vaccinated already never cared countrymen. Awesome, yes contracted Covid vaccinated far mild. Yeah, thought AZ vaccine wouldn’t effective it, Pfizer? don’t base system wide approach little bit evidence small sample size. Especially headed good direction. Supply ramping up, cases coming down. reason fix something unless it’s broken. get approach countries supply issues makes sense US unless want run another trial showing works would take least couple months point especially given would need volunteers enough cases trial may hard point.  Check comment history, looks exhausting Hi forced go school FLU high school bc didn’t excused absence days. mean students? work? go outside? seems bit hyperbolic job TV loop announcements stuff. TV loop right count absenteeism talking many manufacturing hours lost. includes sick days medical leave. frustrating. install grammer/spelling extension chrome, browse web usually see many highly respected trusted sites typo. Even major news outlets pretty often. proof vaccine stops getting virus spreading others? Please share source educate me! barely prioritize vaccinations local state level. fuck think could world level. mean, still better nothing right? It’s still piece several layers cloth, made company claim is. crazy N95 masks made readily available people, especially given shortage. This. know several older people couldn’t didn’t patience navigate sign changed selecting date. kids friends helped able get appointment little work. 1 3? Misleading title - didn’t threaten anything, simply said don’t want we’ll send somewhere else! many world would received shot point spread everywhere... 0.5%? Less? would like vaccine all, anywhere. There's enough go around... *yet.* Good Ukraine? Wildly nations invented invested vaccines. likely aren't, guys seem believe rule law assumed laws apply US Marshals. Prolly would easier wear mask?? I'm working sick right now.. work makes take 2 weeks anytime slight sniffle, positive covid test not. 3 year old day care brings home new cold like month.. I've already twice past 4 months can't afford another 2 weeks off, would break us. kept mouth shut. What’s really sick many workers defend work culture, working death company zero loyalty concern them. isn’t older workers either... find culture upheld young middle aged workers well. strengthen worker rights stop enabling unacceptable. Show proof vaccine keeps spending virus others. lol, standard student apartment university.

They designed students would spend time anywhere else home. Lots ads masks Reddit well, like hope health supply think it’s called? There’s also /r/masks4all lot people sub clue anything general public has. like hear like feel smart, talk something relevant. I'd recomment coming articles taking comment serious. article itself. obstacle comes companies like Facebook Google, banned sale advertising N95 masks effort thwart profiteers diverting vital medical gear needed frontline medical workers. Cost job. horrible, I'm sorry tough spot. means ideal glad gets go maternity leave soon. Hopefully vaccines readily available time returns. Congrats upcoming joy. :) 😂😂 Show science vaccine keeps getting infection stops spreading it. Everything read says suppose lessen severity virus still get potentially infect others. That’s still want wear mask. Based age she’s high risk group severe disease. Researches done countries like China India majority Europe. Yet America first. proved point. That's expect. Multiple snow storms power outages around country. Hopefully worst winter weather behind us week. Hi think numbers across board going low, vaccinations one, cases well. Almost pushed pause everything week. thaw out, anticipate everything going back again. Math teacher. Missing class causes problems student missed, teacher, students class. way school currently works highly dependent students less page given topic. 

There also definitely exist students miss school frequently reasons health (maybe parents want travel family , it’s student’s birthday, student wakes really wants stay home relax).

These type students regularly miss often need to
(A) ask teacher help outside class catch otherwise would needed.
(B) independently try get caught topic using learning materials class/internet
(C) lean classmates help 
(D) ask questions thoroughly understood rest students previous classes 

Because things tend burden way another almost everyone class, emphasis placed attendance. 

Unfortunately, also leads students genuinely sick need missing class expense others health. 

Obviously pandemic emphasis attendance backfires big way. 

I think real solution problem, shift learning students page towards mastery learning: students move topic demonstrated thoroughly understand apply it. means students cannot tethered topic. students miss day would negatively impact others. 

Unfortunately isn’t simple. benchmarks must met student’s? teachers students re-trained teach/learn new way. Etc...

However think, pandemic exacerbated problems trying keep students page enough may good time reassess teaching methods consider changing substantial ways. Colorado. did. results support me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm worried might us kid starts school couple years, hope people flexible time comes. thing getting sick average kid spread virus us, illness year, refreshing. Apparently sick kids make kids sick; we're really hoping parents keep sick kids home future. I’m half household isn’t vaccinated god damn want go normal dinner night half. 

Soon. Interesting detail: two smaller Islands, Saba Sint Eustatius, receive Moderna vaccine. population small, entire population vaccinated one go, prevent spillage. start Monday. 4 weeks (time Moderna doses), two regions first fully immunized regions country. school made sure everybody show making perfect attendance one ways exempt end year exams.

You 70 average perfect attendance, 100 1 absence doesn’t matter. 

They also voided doctor’s excuses way remove absences, they’re “not school related”. I’ve gone school sick times count now. really think researchers surveying covid related depression Syria Somalia? literally see countries studies based graph. Given leave try get pregnant? Bruh tf good news flair Oh wouldn’t dream arguing you. father law went Yale lawyer? foundation run family? Bill Gates doesn’t want understand tax estate law? You’re logic undeniable. work culture Japan probably worst developed world rest point makes sense forced stay 20sq meter room involuntarily? need help? reason schools still care attendance federal government. feds require students attend minimum number days school, students reach goal feds cut amount funding school receives. 

And schools get exemptions sick students, exemptions require student written note doctor. Well fact going doctor costs money time parents always have... ridiculous take kid doctor simply suffering stomach bug, mention time able get kid see doctor would likely already well. happens many kids notes doctors schools need feds school start trying things force kids come school whether sick not. schools even threaten call child services kid misses many days. often schools cross line need back fuck up. You’re disappointment wife Covid don’t really get take anytime work together year one coworkers came work sick. 

Stay fuck home, aren’t slaves. Travel get vaccine. Lucky companies hiring geniuses. Try search engine DuckDuckGo ""Let's show everybody well vaccine works lowering cases much vaccine even get chance prove works.""

Sorry, resist. bit sarcasm. good they've opened borders vaccinated people. Even influx foreigners present risk, well worth boost economy back up. seriously hope tourist countries follow suit. I'd also posit theory:

the people gathering, working, cautious - population (let's call third half country, throw wild ass guess) LOT covid infections. There's probably another third country pretty cautious limiting exposure lot.

So population likely get covid getting lot it, vaccinations, we're starting see effects herd immunity population people likely contract/spread virus air might much dryer you’re used cold isn’t common. Every year allergies go nuts it’s winter. politician USA would sign they'll immediately voted office. sure America big enough dystopia account 50% anxiety cases despite tiny part global population, America PERCEIVED biggest dystopia world. can’t imagine people oppressed American say Syria.  66.666 percent be. far I’m concerned Quebec hasn’t administered single vaccine (no second doses yet). major study comes proving they’re fine, great, remember they’re 0 scientific backing right now, essentially imposing real world clinical trial citizens. care size english writing menus peoples’ wellbeing. Finally good news Cali trending right direction! Skid row, tenderloin district, come soon! don’t know would be. It’s intimidation tactic part idiots challenged “Marshals”. probably thought going federal would easier recognize fed vs local leo. Sure, force go back? families also can’t send kids back high risk family members kids would risk.  kids high risk wife. Enough people died virus others willing sacrifice risk rush people back normal days. schools haven’t made changes necessary prevent spread COVID-19 every week get two letters school encouraging people send kids back another recent outbreak. work long hours barely got see kids this. still work long hours pay cut get home actually see more. force people back? Keep options. Especially it’s preventing people dying. guess he’s probably referring claim apparently originated German govt 8% effective 65s Macron claiming it’s quasi-ineffective group. claims either false supported evidence.

I’m pretty sure one ever claimed decisions made regulators disinformation. apparently UK enforcing export ban AstraZeneca, despite contractual obligations EU, allowing manage production move vaccines UK.

Where brexit brigade? Mods, better remove reply well. honestly it'd seem beneficial point. really think vaccine killed him, would tell anyone? could told  Swedish, must know that:

- State epidiologist Tegnell several internal e-mails argued ex. benefit letting school children spread virus. 

- publicly said want eradicate *all* spread virus. 

- leaders several opposition parties said briefings strategy told herd immunity goal. 

- Tegnell mail Pete Tüll wrote decided go herd immunity strategy. 


All well known Sweden. question Swedes keep denying threads? Cmon Florida man, stick drugs, stop stupid masks. local news said lot vaccines shipments US cancelled mass vaccination centers closed due weather numbers might low week. think less making kids go school get education, freeing parents go office (also terrible idea) keep economy going.

Politicians perfectly fine exposing kids altar economy, US. UK (repeatedly!) geology class labs, made almost (I think missed one), mostly involved looking rocks identifying properties going worksheets. Almost none labs someone would difficulty making weren’t issue identified above. You’re talking technical college labs, I’m talking homework policies class work. Oh blow ass. Glass 2/3 full. still carry disease infect someone chance get vaccine yet sudden UK export ban start settle all?

Mods words, watch out. ""The EU signed bad contracts.""

Isn't lot people said sub? could ever know material compare to. EU released AstraZeneca, CureVac Sanofi contract. Others not.

Now compare... Guess what? read earlier vaccine ~50% efficacy 1st dose. Anybody else remember that? getting extra dose vial? giving lesser dose vaccine recipients? 

I'm glad I'm Canada half-assed ""rollout"". US based companies position. cited article less half price Demetech [""I ARRESTED FORCE WEAR  Yes, still thing. Even year still thing. BS. refute call police, hints racist want police. Worth noting 95% confidence interval 69%-98%. unlikely real efficacy way 93%, line thinking. Hey feeling now, fully recovered covid &amp; still get shortness breath? Eh, people get sick hearing variants eventually. find something interesting talk about. Yea I’m nurse basically everyone work come sick don’t want use Paid Time sickness. wanna use vacation Minimizing controllable risks means opening indoor dining pandemic. Certainly less still risk. CDC mention droplets also land surfaces objects. possible person could get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, eyes.

Though admittedly says common way. still option person washing utensils I'd putting mouth vaccinated not, I'd definitely pick vaccinated. Thank maskless parties could safe. narrative back Trump strong arming CDC kill Americans! Well flag blue nothing’s changed. Makes wonder they’re one team? yes.most testing programs sort reward valuable participation.imo easy money tbh. Wait, something wrong Mr Peanutbutter? It’s called American capitalism 

And it’s fucking disease Hey feeling now, fully recovered covid &amp; still get shortness breath? approved emergency use dumb question. Employers don’t offer sick days offer sick days it’s usually max 4-5 days. little billy boy gets flu September take week work, eats sick time. Billy gets strep December shit outta luck take one day without pay spend money outta pocket urgent care diagnosis strep that’s time afford. practically beg doctor steroid pack little billy feel better enough go school next day dose Motrin pray lasts least 6-8hrs like says back box. 

If seems like bad example haven’t spent enough time low income America. doubt it. Look North Dakota. still cold shit warm April/May, yet they've consistent downward trend since insane peak 2,300 cases one day back early December. They've nearly 100k cases tiny population ~760k. seroprevalence studies show actual infections may four-fold more. may actually significant population immunity point. Whoa, news come from. could absolute game changer! Same. One person issues 6 months since resolved. Wait bad boy hit annihilation speed. I'll defib defib me! *predator handshake* Note: Pfizer actually say journal articles pretty much do.

Slight problem ""must exclusively use title"" rule. So...misleading headline? Yea probably 80% bad news past year right thoroughly ignored everyone. makes uncomfortable want go back living American myth doesn’t mean readers want keep track information like this. That’s lot guinea pigs Ancient slipknot posters found caves near modern day Sweden people upstate booking appointments near city people city booking upstate? logic checks out. body, going people refusing vaccine. dare frame ""personal choice"" issue obviously nobody would cared choice affected personally. Expect new variant pop every weeks media get panic clicks referenced company sketchy engaged weird stuff here. legit places get N95 masks. one them. State law changed. Schools get paid per student enrolled period. many absences, needs different way deal versus paying school. sure start discussing, anyone developed tendonitis-like symptoms shooting pains wrists first time covid?? I'm artist guitarist can't use hands, wrists swell hurt bad. never happened before. Omg would game changer comment valid im assuming get sick,they probably get vaccine help recover anything like happens. don’t think past prologue. news article came today increase doses. Excellent news though. we’re limited 1.9M doses day. parents thread upvoted comment Yeah transitive transmission would give better chance immunity. Hope good! Yeah figured 95 CI would massive Honestly stayed home every time kid's nose slightly runny scratchy throat morning would probably much November- February. Cold? Allergies? Dry air? say? cold mildly annoying symptoms 10 days rarely feel badly day two. much cautious course hope protections sick kids workers flexibility work/ school home. Why?

Parents send kids school either:

* Think kid sick take care himself. 
* Don’t trust kid house alone. 

And

* can’t afford take time work home them. bet know voted for. potentially huge. means single dose essentially good two doses. could delay second doses get everyone vaccinated half time. 

If needed, administer second doses later ensure long-lasting immunity. mild moderate cases fine, unless bad genetics? It’s probably mentioned I’m going scroll — reason we’ve sent kids school keep parents working contributing labor capitalist economy cares extracting profit people. exposure probably limited initial case. I’m worried whether people works closely may spread me. Last time work 7 days ago somebody exposed they’d likely either asympotsmtic start showing symptoms soon. suspect exposed last two days sometime near future. Luckily tomorrow. We’ve people office covid spread early pandemic. work chemistry lab fairly spaced part wear masks ventilation best buy work concentrated acids. suspect I’ll alright especially given fact none coworkers work room 20-30 percent day coworker sick showing symptoms good sign. moderate immunity Cherry top. Really hope becaus would hate get sick I’m able fully immunized seems like dodged question aw shucks Biden moment course they'll open up. People dying over. Another business take place ones fail.

The thing slowing case numbers.  fired trying get pregnant, that's silly thing business owner putting people risk allowing unvaccinated customers.

Oh, falling back whataboutism now? arguing everyone put maximum peril instead minimizing controllable risks? What's logic there? Fair enough, social distancing long term basis practical. Lmao.

It’s whether counties same. It’s competence administration.

If truly believe need look comprehensive scale public education USA sit reconsider said. 

But means show (rare occurrence) teachers paid they’re actually worth. resources assistance ease job. they’re content admin. 

And let know salaries compare national local poverty guidelines assumption single income households.

We’ve defunded education years years years less educated workforce apparently bad thing.

On global scale, going penalized this. absolutely gonna come back bite us. True enough! hope changes get “webcam you’re sick” days. OP wear mask January 2020 doctors thought cough ""weird"". mask STRANGE hated took selfie mask ""lol dumb!!!"". Ah... know... There's new study says 93%, guess, literally one hour ago answer would've 60%, somewhere range suppose. $$$. Schools get state money based average daily attendance. teacher, high school got letter threatening drop classes two weeks sick. numerous chronic illnesses doctors notes still got drop threat letter. Bs keeping work. Simple, public school child care education. Would also support grocery store worker union said worker returning work vaccinated? workers utilities? Cell phone telecommunication operators? Agricultural workers unions, return work vaccinated? military? truckers, warehouse operators, manufacturers, construction workers, heating plumbing repair people? honestly make argument *all* people stay home vaccinated? Using logic laid ""hold line"" too. Within month wish likely granted. -No functional health care many Americans. 

-No sick leave parents must work

-Lack affordable child care, schools become baby sitters 

-during COVID parents refuse wear mask themselves, refused believe it’s real

Ain’t damn sub going work sick factory little pay protections. Unfortunately CI 69 98% much data, whereas 2 dose 90 98%. meant picked initial clinical trials?  kids school introduced flags year hang outside classroom students present day sent home flyers ""its ok away"".. think pandemic changed anything. absolutely fantastic news true. Guessing money?

Edit: “But would-be attendees sick living isolation willing pay $30,000 inundated Diamandis team requests.”

Yup. anyone else starting recognize growing resentment towards politician older generation younger generation?? I'm seeing weeks go by. younger generation (I'll say ages 16-29) lost much basically told suck fuck off. Better yet, people aged 16-29 treated terribly BLAMED keeping pandemic going. mean tell lost job, prospects future, whole year socializing/learning told I'm STILL blame??? Yeah. Miss that. 

I think politicians media corporations realize they've shot foot least next decade. People age pissed lost year lives still get blamed. Family member front line worker. Recently fever sore throat, fatigue aches. checked work. 
Counted call day points her. Next time said take antipyretics go work.

""Biden think things normal?""

""December.""

It like

""Biden think things normal?""

""You know, thank Jesus think Christmas gonna look pretty good year.""

So think reflects sort official expectation policy. I'm good hygiene (e.g., hand washing). mostly responding ""social distancing"" part comment. helps look vaccine's effectiveness less help hypothetical single person, help wider population. undeniably bad news, however may bad *enough* news public health perspective, words effectiveness reduced may still effective *enough* out-pace spread variant. 

If like analogies, grass fire used lot describe spread virus, vaccines large-caliber fire hoses. *Any* working hose extinguish grass burning, need enough water spread quickly enough put faster catches grass fire.

If fire burning strained analogy transmissible variant, we've learned hose large we'd thought. may fact still large enough, need data know sure -- know precisely many gallons per minute need particular fire we're working on. student come school MUMPS two years ago. Parents didn’t vaccinate sent kid sick. 

I’ve also AP students come hospital band still take tests (that easily could made up) parents made go school. 5 hours? absolutely Western part New York 9 hours away absolute Eastern part. one travel across HALF state get vaccine, that's asinine. they're willing currently can't get appointment locally, mean appointments exist. People get appointments hospitals medical establishments big vaccine sites, try hard enough. want one week willing travel far, that's them.

And flat stated 2/15 pharmacy policies changing still 65+ yes, people known that. Otherwise looked appointments unless thought changed. Maybe better system place sure, mean ever supposed way.

But may either way, change fact makes sense pharmacies 65+ right now. Maybe weeks change there's still many elderly individuals can't get appointment elsewhere, even wanted travel. open anyone else, basically getting either. Either way, can't afford make big mistakes threaten wellbeing others, guess?  efficacy first dose much higher margin error second dose. need get second dose willing participate study probably got rewarded volunteering.nobody forced experiment.it would considered unethical forced join :) making close contact hundred people day? Hey fault can't get one even though want badly since I'm good health 20 years old. really start giving everyone people high risk gotten point. long schools get paid butts seats schools going perfect attendance awards. 93% immune. hard measure chance spreading it, know, reasonable guess would cause large decrease transmission.  Why? employers expect people work. can't work kid sick school. What’s worst could happen?

Death. ☠️ Interesting, thank you! teacher emailed class reschedule zoom classes vaccine appointments. They’re still getting paid. It’s easy want go ridiculous idea like zero Covid non-essential job business getting shut always someone *else’s* job business. didn’t know about. It’s yearly ritual work hospital good know. employers choice plague rat staff. never aspired that. always valued mental health days.  Quick! Cut beard glue head Common link could also elevated levels chronic stress Ludicrous speed Im sorry, get yours? gorillas pissed found got Covid! Public schools place premium attendance get paid district state based ADA (Average Daily Attendance). 5% students stayed home sick, they'd lose 5% money. encourage sick students come school long they're \*too\* sick (fever vomiting tend dividing point). hear you, technically amount ordered isn’t going change would mean rest world. I’m supposed get second Pfizer dose days I’m seriously reconsidering seeing study. idea side effects second dose bad. Meh. valve, getting protection surgical mask N95 nothing exhale. Sure, it'll help protect wearer, protecting around huge reason wear mask. places let valved N95 (and shouldn't; perspective others, mask face) Boo hoo ""I got shots got sick"". Cry river. FDA said since beginning. mean could potentially make Pfizer 1 dose vaccine? Cause would huge. There's evidence emerging lately vaccines reduce viral load reduces viral shedding. link handy, pretty sure saw sub.

IMO, point, targeting vectors effective targeting vulnerable isolating. Ideally everyone would be, vaccine supply limited, targeted reducing total cases also reduces total deaths, instead simply reducing deaths.

Though wish story long term care worker instead server restaurant, suppose harder find people qualified willing work long term care settings restaurants. Vaccinating work vulnerable potentially interact others outside would target overall spread deaths creating buffer communities spread may occurring likely succumb virus. spent like 5 years partying snd total dipshit you’ll still ahead even takes little long first year two haha. get frustration, like you’re suppose sit try anything?? It’s dismissive. 4 years thinkpiece people 25 behind something. stuff different day. came us (millennials)over buying avocado toast snd liking chili’s. It’s also fault people don’t buy napkins anymore! Apparently!  news since beginning. FDA said December. hospitals make crazy bank students residents. Many programs student works free paying tuition. Residents get paid 60k year 4 years hospital banks work (up 80 hours week allowed AMA). government even pays residents wages hospitals. grade school gave awards end year, one perfect attendance. remember getting every year feeling pretty satisfied myself.

Then middle school typical teenager ditched class lot, give awards point anymore gave punishments bad attendance. making things now. study fully peer reviewed accepted scientific community. link it: point obviously arguing bad faith. You’re expecting media cover good news? case, I’ve got beachfront property Kansas sell you. media ignore good news story hammer “Variants scary!!” cows come home. problem people worry protecting themselves. don’t wanna get scary virus stay home don’t go out. work children young people done 10 years now.

I know probably need hear this, sound like know snow day mental health development zoom class could have. Nice work there. every day saw multiple stories today within hours 180 degree contradictions lol. four variants left go form infinity gauntlet! move hot zone get job meat processing plant Amazon. tell us vaccine people took. Pfizer, don’t personally care. got Moderna. could said Pfizer folks. give us got, move lol. Ha ha:( no. U.S. course. Like China, slightly better advertising/public relations department. Here’s suggestion: Make vaccines. second Novavax appointment week enrolling teenagers location at. However research office university campus, could Pfizer moderna well. feel completely. It’s almost year like this. year! I’m single man early 20s. Fresh college. I’m spending adulthood. Sitting home Friday nights binging Golden Girls mom. can’t more. don’t know much longer put this. Pfizer going try get single dose FDA approval anytime soon? Really? [organ [blood too? deny truth want, long hauler real. really efficient way make anyone take brain break hours hours zoom classes feel even shittier. kid got award one year. actually legit— never got sick. would never sent did. Go figure.

Other kids. wife would assume parents care work could stay home them. lucky regard. schools safe reopen. Teachers aren’t dying covid contracted students. Schools Europe never closed completely fine. Schools Florida completely back open single teachers death due covid caught school.

The administration isn’t following science. They’re caving demands teachers unions put personal gain ahead students. dentist, felt like got last email state. know people weren’t healthcare simply overweight go ahead line... calm down, jung long hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, we’ll get used get back normal. researcher Wuhan chance? see linked private medical practice hormone treatment men low testosterone. I’m saying you’re incorrect don’t really trust source. CEO sounds like got position smarts. Look Halyard Fluidshield N95, got box Amazon long ago 30 50$. liked wearing extended periods time hospital, I’d take 3M n95 job FDA already determined months ago think. Maybe wasn’t fda know read late December/early jan. teen, went school one day highschool. Looking back, wish enjoyed school sure workaholic; mindset stuck maybe 3 years ago laid got thinking, dedicated hamster wheel?

I really hate sick people go work, makes sense mindset ingrained early. science takes time. sites. Using reader mode, turning javascript etc. also work. situation med school students clinical residency notoriously bad representative work environments cultures.

I know still crackdown crazy working conditions hospitals put new professionals through, absolutely unethical. employees, patients too. “we may actually normal summer.”

“Widespread vaccination going take much longer that, I'm afraid. even starting vaccinations under-65s medical conditions younger April, millions even get under-50s make final group. that's assuming keep rate vaccinations we're currently maintaining, face supply shortages.

I think get hopes ""normal summer"". think ""normal fall"" significantly likely, though. “

Comment r/California. Thoughts? study says Pfizer 93% effective one dose questioning fuck went week hell extra 2% effectiveness. misinterpreting data, someone make feel better vomiting guts feeling like shit second dose lol Yes. second dose reintroduce spike protein immune system trained deal it. increases immune response (which many people stronger reactions second shot). likely helps train body deal virus, gives longer immunity. data? cdc lol. know fact study claiming hundreds thousands cases 100% bunk based ""could happen"" zero evidence whatsoever. actual number probably somewhere Good question. may uncertainty duration protection single dose, administration second dose within 1 month first, recommended, provides little added benefit short term, high-risk persons could received first dose vaccine supply left completely guess argument buys time administer first doses many people possible, second round. first dose higher efficiency might make ""first dose first"" solid strategy. Also US massively screwed normalizing masks thought might sick absolutely go sick. People freaking grown it. Hear out, wouldn’t making requirement open schools guarantee teachers prioritized? missing something here? stupid require proof Covid vaccination instead negative test. Same, discussion doctor said let know (when schools reopen) little man needs time he'll give note send school. Illness care test scores ""No one cover shift"". hope pandemic least gives us right sick care dependants are. kind seen, least US. Although overall trend down, Dakotas, instance started downward trend Thanksgiving. Lol probably already based case trends.

No way hell line graph following shape immunity-driven decay curve month cases fallen 68% coincidence. Preventing flu deaths far easier. need drop reproductive rate 75%, 10% avoid seasonal waves. little vaccination (on top handwashing we've probably got OCD now) it.

Even year, flu deaths significantly vaccination. can't, THAT'S PROBLEM, fuck me, im OP  supposed that? can't vaccinate whole planet once. real... especially since it’s 1 dose person. finished graduation requirements early give diploma let graduate early community service paid fines make poor attendance.

Still wondering made sense. Yes, practical. bit weird. done vivo testing yet, vitro one show 2/3rd reduction neutralizing antibodies. seen big reduction, actually know that's enough drop affect immunity. Why? still cutoff point number = immunity. example Hep B, know antibody titers higher 10 still protected consider booster soon ish cause anything lower considered protected.

We cut point covid. vaccines could giving us titres 1000, new variant drops 100, matter cause need 10 fight off. 

I hope somewhat understandable. getting second dose time (be 3, 6, 12 weeks whatever), long would protection last? understand is, second dose much push efficacy points, make immunization long lasting. love Germany. also family there. Lots systems pretty great.

I tend look states countries curiosity eye towards learn what's working well, opportunity trash it, maybe that's weird. can't repeated enough.

People can't run around saying ""listen science"" turn turbo Karens comes opening schools. absolutely ridiculous. Gurl! girl boring life! vacations, staying home watch Price Right, etc. Welp least we’re resilient like older people try tell us, like that’ll give us back year experiences milestones lost :) 

Anyways serious note, I’m sorry career. hope get back everything works you. Sure, I’m Pittsburgh spending little free time trying get in-laws appointment here. grandma Suffolk county Long Island. remember discontinued children’s school (somewhere mid 2000’s). long overdue, promote going school even felt lousy made sick feel like sort failure. Schools get paid based number students attendance. kid stays home, get money day. terrible, stupid system.   second dose basically nothing? Plague rat 😂 I’m saying. Like yes, great trying conceive. you’re frontline worker, get vaccine, wait month two try conceive again. find job allows work home. honestly know rate baldness people African decent, yes, ethnicity play role. never biggest fan observational style studies take issues tie together taking account variables. perfect example correlation mean causation. headline awful. way declare baldness risk factor, study nothing severity. testing positive.

I swear, since outbreak COVID read garbage studies online read entire life. like every hack world lining create studies find links without first clue truly run study. Even ones done people typically hacks end causing issues (I looking Henry Ford Health garbage study hydroxychloroquine). Touching plates nothing anything.

not everyone washes hands every 3 minutes busy. makes issue. come ""well should"", would isolated killed virus year ago. Prove virus putting others risk. Also ill tell thing told op, don’t wanna get sick don’t go restaurant.

Well, that's incorrect. Masks reduce risk, they're magic bulletproof shield. That’s case NJ lose hair... migrates south never comes back north :/ emphasized attendance detriment wellness far long. good news could potentially almost double vaccination, study says 1st dose Pfizer vaccine 93% effective 2 weeks, almost good 2 doses. could really big. Okay? anecdote 8 years ago, general nastiness restaurants. Also, doesn’t baldness affect African - American males more, likely adverse covid outcomes well?

Vaccinating elderly likely wind hospital makes sense, everyone saying otherwise true goal - whole point lock downs, whole reason crappy year+ - mind, prevent overwhelming health care system. problem school meant teach value education. meant instill tenants regular work day. Show time, get work done, take breaks allowed, come work sick get work done. 

School set teach good employee. cares little human being. Strict attendance policies set benefit company. give half shit going through. replaceable. matter. health matter. matters keep making company money. can't replaced.

This shit teaching children. Go shitty dead end job time. Keep head talk back authority figured. Make sure get work done due date ass fired capital F. reason need education reform Really? district would “count day”, literally non stop week count day non stop reminders messages parent make sure you’re day. Daily attendance makes much sense that.

Ive vaccinated sure hell waiting December. priorities state vaccinated Im living life again. Dont care anymore. Something lot people know, states part funding schools get tied student attendance. many absences, funding gets cut. Schools push ""perfect attendance"" hurting grade absences want lose not-enough-funding get able educate students. Dehydration/altitude sickness. Happened first time going Colorado.

If everything stock market driven, yes.   Nah, that's watching father's work ethic. Dude 60s, retired, got another job can't get settle down. free childcare honest, feel optimistic year, especially stuff went past several months. Actually pandemic showed exact opposite... terrible missing school kids. kid quarantine flu two weeks literally worst possible lesson could even imagine take away pandemic... hated high school graduated, remember looking back surprised adequately prepared college. really gave decent foundation. also punishes sick kids. I’ve ill since child, missed ton school. high school defend credits even though graduated top 10% class advanced program study. I’m teacher hate watching sick kids give opportunities things enjoy weekends they’re sitting loss credit, despite good grades. you’re sick don’t get lot time things enjoy weekends pretty valuable. would happen someone got one dose vaccine? much immunity would have? worked restaurant. thinking dish washer. Obviously comparable waitress atleast give option/ workaround.

My reasoning CDC saying surface transmission significant risk. (Though possible, yes) baby whenever wants. also lose job getting vaccinated. sound fair me. Essential workers stocking children's Fruit Loops Lucky Charms can't afford child care, school really helps out. believe side WFH Redditors seem miss point on. I'm software developer. I've code 13+ years I've fully remote 9+. 

At literally every job I've had, big part success showing time listening people. Phase 1A Phase 1B 37% population California. Since Phase 1A healthcare workers long term care residents assume get vaccinated (3 million 100% vaccination rate). Phase 1B includes 12 million people, around 70% vaccination acceptance rate assume moment around 8.4 million even want vaccine. Thus, Phase 1 completely account 11.4 million vaccinations right now, 29% population California. Considering great deal people won’t get vaccinated March 15 (based many factors vaccination rates, wanting wait others get first “test” etc), assume less 29% population California vaccinated comorbidities start signing up. carrot end stick think guy responded meant foot doctor. analogy foot doctor treat headache. People wearing masks thousands years. According  Angela Rasmussen, virologist Georgetown University’s Center Global Health Science Security,  two-thirds drop neutralization South Africa variant's mutations, conclusion made vaccine performing real world it’s still known immune response necessary protection current vaccines, known ***immune correlate protection***. one definitely tell answer. hear lot ""should"" words fact matter nobody knows answer. explains clearly science behind new Covid variants spreading faster vaccines might work. Strongly recommended. Imagine year still believing risk covid death. also contact Einstein ~3% people Covid died many struggle complications related virus. masks. friend fucked corporate culture made us think way. one ever feel guilty taking vacation Sick kids? ever seen sick adults work? Like father like son. lot people reddit contrarian high schoolers plenty parents knowingly send sick kids school time, pre-pandemic during. Hell, parents city said want kids back school full time ""no matter what"" even 6' distancing place. gonna fit them? feel like 60% parents lost goddamn mind pandemic.  sad thing is, species basically unlimited resources point, top 1% busy playing real-life monopoly. could easily let people follow passion (and heavily incentivize things still need can't automate away) knows would advance species.

But no, let's keep going work 102-degree fever sweats prove strong workers are! Almost like different people different opinions. 

Are discovering Einstein, people hivemind? Join me. way. coronavirus transmission vector. need conversation someone virus needs aerosolized airborne, need inhale upper respiratory tract.

Getting mouth hands skin effective unless someone cough directly finger immediately jam solidly nose take deep sniff.

The staff back transmitting directly patrons, servers going vectors customers. answer needs go top!!! 

This why. Good attendance means money public schools don’t see news media pushing flu vaccine every year children, you?

Yes do. yearly flu vaccine recommended children 6 months. want wear mask rest life go ahead. majority won’t. employer right employ people don’t take vaccine. Yea fuck woman control body reproductive decisions. Yes will. pandemic forever current measure permanent it’s feasible economically, financially mentally. 99.9985% us left! clandestine pathogen ? awesome. Really? Vet here. vaccinated, without choice, yellow fever number obscure diseases never encounter. ridiculous. high blood pressure well control. Sit around 120/70 minute sitting down.

Maybe bring HR blood pressure doc. get low HR warning every morning around 2 5 AM. Dips 37/38 20 minutes so, every hour. Seems deep sleep. I’m shareholder, JNJ got $1B promise 100M doses ready use. failure. Breach contract? I’d see agreement text, unable produce more?

Right would say covid-unrelated ailment. Fortunately, risk children covid lower risk flu. So, adults vaccinated covid pose much substantial chunk population comorbidity incapable functioning themselves. pharmacies get go elderly policy never changed. understood ""this right now, register anywhere else"" anyone appointment cancelled homework.

The point make easy elderly possible. open pharmacies anyone comorbidity guess what, elderly would never get appointments considering many people qualify New York right now. Eh can’t really blame people don’t know risks could possibly pregnant women. 5 nurses unit work aren’t getting reason. 2 actively pregnant 3 trying Pfizer Moderna started churning vaccine doses trials still ongoing.

I even get started someone register someone nepotism registration even open public, ridiculous tell senior citizens ""register online"".

It getting slowly better increasing supply offsetting general fuckery going process.

I deny vaccine reluctance thing, anecdotally lot people want shot lack resources jump hoops call favors get experience. literally go site refresh get told receive call back never comes.

Not actually gets hopes whatsoever, life future 100% dictated law school I’m sure make classes mandatory online next year (after first week so, tuition becomes non-refundable, like they’ve done last 2 semesters). Yea can’t friggen find non valved n95 best scenario protect others Lol screw him. Hopefully, state legislature prioritizes teachers. Clearly, Foghorn Leghorn doesn’t care teachers unless work private school. confidence interval wild Pfizer backed up. She’s following CDC recommendations all. even little bit. CDC literally says reason delay getting pregnant taking vaccine. also say it’s “a personal choice” pregnant women. Here, read yourself. Hot press February 12th, 2021. Seems risky based what? countries kept schools open without problems. studies show schools significant source transmission. CDC come said safe reopen schools.

There poor families depend free lunch kids. lot working class people can't afford day care can't go work kids home. can't ruin bunch people's lives *just case*, science says safe. Hey juddshanks

Just following claim, Im interested makes believe tourism industry 'evaporated' opposite happening spouting misinformation here, Im concerned widely held belief Melbourne?

Are involved industry struggling hate boner Andrews influencing opinion? Im leaning towards latter honest.

Cheers Sure, interested surgical mask protect around me, would buy surgical mask. N95 masks offer superior protection. Hey feeling &amp; still get shortness breath? Thank really helped! think we’re dismissing [Hygiene little early here. immune system works best gets regular use, quite simply, cold flu season annoyance years, tremendous burden.

Plus, start road try permanently modify behavior, viruses probably evolve spread easily, could actually lead another big outbreak road. We’re may end turning pile dry tinder trying avoid catching fire. Well validates that.  2. Imagine J&amp;J least tacked on, maybe 2M/week minimum April.

The USA bandwidth administer 4M shots day within 45 days. Let's see it! totally agree, they’re making decisions based outcomes. vulnerable vaccinated, hospitalizations/deaths basically negligible, spread reduced due significant % population vaccinated + natural immunity previous infections, even reaching Fauci’s goal (which ranged 70% said 75-85% think?).

I hope making decisions based outcomes, I’m feeling pretty pessimistic little easing restrictions arbitrarily large % non-risk population fully vaccinated, even adverse outcomes fall low transmission slows. really depends person. case, nothing sore arm, although couple days longer first. wife, also bruise rash vaccination site 4 days. fever, fatigue, gastro upset either us shot 1 2. N95 protects surgical protects others. Everyone covered so? Seems understand probability. local school district repeatedly opened closed due staff shortages resulted staff quarantine due exposure. time, entire working community tasked finding children work hours two weeks time. school closings ripple effect community.

meanwhile, think misunderstanding effective reach vaccine risk exposure means clinical sense. cases, vulnerable infection vulnerable infected. Imagine 10 years old bounty head. tho Over-simplification half-truth. CDC indicates reopening safe (1) community control measures kept spread controlled, (2) certain safety measures place, inside school.

And teachers died. Hundreds dead, according American Federation Teachers. Google search easily confirm this. Seriously, great job! used work place upper manager would break barely got work snowstorms, could get work anyone else able well. Mental physical health PTO must! ableist.

In high school, ill time. Vice Principal called ""bad kid"", said using chronic illness excuse, threatened call CPS parents. 

Eventually meeting VP, school guidance counselors, parents. parents brought back up, rheumatologist. doctor pissed.

I wish evil VP. literally dropped high school cruelty. So... base changes preventing primers binding? evading otherwise? poor people can't take day child sick often can't afford babysitter. Leave nanny, duh!  I’m saying think they’d side her. Didn’t New York send covid patients nursing homes? workplace safety failure? politicians know schools tied economy, kids staying home chances many parents well instead working stimulating economy depend state. Alaska vaccinations reached around 20 percent population. Case load yesterday state lowest since September. Locally, Anchorage municipality 300,000 people, 9 cases. priority? Like 10th? Vestigial industrial values. fading away. lot people can't afford daycare can't work without putting kids back school.

I understand people coming want destitute appear significant risks reopening schools. Thanks information. 1 2 years never like before. Didn’t need information thank bought pack don’t regret it. feel much safer classroom bootleg masks using before. [Pfizer NEJM [FDA EUA say vaccine efficacy 82% first dose.  important point none vaccines full approval. They're emergency approval. means, employer can't mandate vaccines yet. 

This company risking lawsuit unlikely win. Young people still get long covid may effect rest lives. need work living. People pension stay home wait. ""Damage includes inflammation heart muscle (myocarditis), scarring death heart tissue (infarction), restricted blood supply heart (ischaemia) combinations three.

""  Right, dare say schools reopened, selfish care people dying.

I guess disregarding well working class parents students unsubstantiated fears schools significant vectors transmission make selfish though. goal never turned needing healthy people vaccinated work

White collar workers go back office they've vaccines. There's need rush WFH works fine. Herd immunity impossible vaccines currently available. come one ever talks that? AstraZenica 27% effective reducing asymptomatic transmission [essentially useless SA think that's good enough achieve herd immunity, even 70% population gets vaccinated. even know effective vaccines asymptomatic transmission one seems care enough study that. Covid rules young adults like abstinence education teens. Colleges either closed stay open acceptance plenty students get rona. Staying open draconian rules basically nothing bait switch last year could stop fucking us one damn week, that’d fantastic. We’ve waited long enough return normal god dammit! answer gave guy. 


It's asinine compare reopening last summer, 10% population previously infected vaccine, now. Completely different situations. 🥰 Hope chill time! another form propaganda make good workers. know. California’s least restrictive tier yellow. Like shouldn’t green instead everything goes back before? say reckless per se. probably reckless, many group people multiple front line jobs, like fast food workers.  believe main reason neutralizing antibodies modest first shot. First shot suspected prevent severe cases. believe idea behind second, neutralizing antibodies, hopefully prevent infection outright. Limiting mutation, importantly spread. scientist though. Good news. virus plummeting. can't purge without, know, going numbers way down.

You can't meaningfully compare reopening June 2020, 10% previously infected vaccine, reopening March 2021, 30% previously infected, 12% least one dose vaccine, continuing vaccination program \~1.75% population per week scheduled grow near future.

It's environment. Describing drop infections ""down slightly"" honest good faith description. immunity amongst portion community running around ignoring restrictions behaving though pandemic. It’s subset population. herd within herd.

There herd immunity rest population, trying stay home possible, hand washing, masking, distancing, travelling families dinner parties, etc etc hasn’t tested pregnant women, true, it’s like idea risks could be. mRNA vaccine new tech vaccines around long time. refuse you’re even pregnant yet absurd honestly, sounds like she’s parroting propaganda without critical thought.  Well connected folks getting vaccine jumping queue. little hope things normal people need waiting line well connected vaccinated still staying home nothing opened. anyway... quote ""absence evidence evidence absence"". mention strain puts parenting.

People act like parents miss work home kids without consequences.  People weak California normal while. vaccinating based age, old people normal summer many young people unvaccinated. great! India 💪!! Moderna Pfizer recently reaffirmed belief deliver 100M doses end March another 100 end May. seeing \~20M/week combined March, \~25M/week April May. won’t happen. hand king eventually become future queen. Let courts decide force tell world matters everyone else. refuse reasonable sick work-life balance policies deserve to

go business replaced better companies. People certainly better job social distancing people height Christmas holidays. know masking though, unless they're counting slight shift one cloth mask two, gotten bit common. Found sensible one! Beach tourism overrated. true. inherit baldness parents, children. Local subs lost cause. pfizer, 68-98% efficacy. bit broad range someone works children, pandemic day die wearing mask time cold/flu symptoms like East Asians. Honestly, I’m point. point I’m concerned mental health point. Kids butts seats pay bills. schools want kids there, sick not. Well, you’re missing obvious: mitigation factors work. Distancing, staying home, wearing masks, gathering numbers. work, still affect.

There “herd immunity” play, true herd immunity. It’s everyone. large numbers public still taking seriously; mask up, try stay home, don’t go round family dinners restaurants, etc etc etc.

For chunk population simply ignores (and places, even abide certain rules, depending are), sure, virus probably run subset people. people society, subset probably already, least enough antibodies, slowing statistics down. “herd immunity” building amongst part “the herd.”

However, careful cautious people come hiding; go back restaurants large numbers, abandon masks shopping, theatres large gatherings allowed resume restrictions all, etc, numbers would rapidly increase.

People like look excuses numbers go - weather etc. really, smaller factors simply interaction other.

Vaccines stop viruses reducing number people become infectious, reducing transmission virus (and, lovely thing, generally stopping people dying.) distancing staying home operates exactly vaccine. barrier erected prevents ongoing transmission, moment virus doesn’t pass on, dead.

All arguments world made numbers going down, appropriate course action.

The simple fact every single person world stayed locked cell month, virus would essentially simply disappear. Given can’t that, could lock families homes for.... three months so, let virus run course amongst anyone family it, leaving time ensure end people let out, one still harbouring virus.

And would gone. 

Of course can’t that. Society needs function. Food needs bought, medicines made sold, fire engines run, hospitals staffed.

But get close possible - lockdowns. Essential workers allowed only, enforcing masks hand washing distancing workplaces. Families allowed send one person outside one hour day get groceries. Etc etc

It sounds awful, is: also works. China demonstrated it. Australia demonstrated it. place virus comes outside, international arrivals - quarantine two weeks arrival, leaks happened, stamped snap lockdowns.

Life town like Adelaide Australia largely normal. restrictions - number gathering restrictions, theatres operating half capacity crowds etc, large life pretty normal, virus community all. flared (leaked international hotel quarantine), short, sharp lockdown eradicated control (of course contact tracing, testing quarantine important tools.

Anyway, point is, US isn’t woods yet. lot people still taking mitigation measures, working home possible, ordering online, interacting, masking distancing necessary. need vaccine, don’t immunity tgenerated (at cost 300,000 lives) amongst irresponsible community. look back selfie took last sporting event went fan (I work sports I’ve to/worked bunch since then) restrictions think going mind point:

- 21st birthday 2 weeks 

- school getting ready host conference basketball tournament eventually NCAA regional (before got canned)

- I’m less year away graduating December. 

Little know awaited 21st birthday. 3/16, day everything pretty much shut down. poor cant believe data proving this: ""Second, pretty good evidence people better job social distancing mask wearing,"" said. Centers Disease Control Prevention said ""the actual risks mRNA vaccines pregnant person fetus unknown vaccines studied pregnant women.""  agency said researchers studies planned Pfizer Moderna monitoring people clinical trials became pregnant.

I guess businesses right terminate reason, also true policy appear based science, makes restaurant wrong imo, especially willing take precautions. restaurant gives others medical exemptions ability pass vaccine. trying get pregnant, makes rational sense would want cautious research saw risks situation able turn unless deemed safe situation... second dose likely necessary immunity long-lasting. Still sending kids school sick. sub announcements “don’t come school you’re feeling sick” blame parents say didn’t know weren’t feeling well.

I also work gym people pay private training sessions don’t want miss come coughing things, sneezing, wiping nose touching equipment...

This pandemic may end way people won’t.  exactly.

(the laws refer passed)  thing virus may still getting organs may destruction. Research needs done this. People's health guessing game. Pfizer shot 90+ efficacy one does, universally accept vaccines lower efficacy recommended dosages fine substitutes. Doesn’t make far sense double shots arms give one dose?

Am one thinks maybe vaccine producers realize double profits saying need two shots purposely nonincentive find data one shot?

A one dose 93% efficacy versus two dose 95% probably means impact rare people didn’t work first time, many second one works, it’s addition first

It doesn’t make sense halve total amount people getting soon minor efficacy differentials case, need 2 shots per person. Let's spread vaccines out. think right different variants. I’m pretty sure contagious British variant rampant Israel, it’s starting taking hold US. focused health family members around kids? seems way likely adults elderly get sick rather kids smart enough read basic charts...

50% effectiveness symptomatic infections means definitely effective enough herd immunity. requires least 50% effectiveness infection. Arkansas entered chat.

Nothing stupidity woman. risk serious effects Covid thousands times higher risk vaccine. compounded fact probably deals great deal unmasked people day. way dumber say ur standard antivax housewife, least stay home avoid Covid, job one riskiest. agree data spotty, seem lot reporting wearing masks indoors stops lot spread shorter gatherings (e.g. going grocery store). useless SA variant

Against symptoms. probably still stop hospitalisations deaths though. guess, can’t help feel like dose would increase immunity 93% 95% would better spent increasing vulnerable person’s immunity 0% 93% Coronenberg-19 government take offered vaccine Sputnik, secure beforehand. much choice really. vaccination even started yet. waste year life... know now.

Attendance part school's overall performance. know every day kid misses class.. looked determine school's success rate whether receive funding far know. also really hard teachers.  understand sides, hello at-will employment + 50¢  sars spread sewer system appartmentbuilding 2003? guess that's also risk hotel quarantine.

These mandatory hotels serve discourage travel. moms teacher said ( prior year ) attendance made big part passing grade. top ( younger ) kids couldn’t stay home alone parents cant afford day work due high bills / food costs, along fact child care absurdly pricy. Exactly even get 1 case per 100,00 lowest level restrictions. There's literally level 0 restrictions. Newsome California liberals wants keep us least form restricted living literally forever. didn’t make 3 billion? super big ifs lot downside. going spread it, others get vaccinated? I’ve “discussing” guy another sub thinks I’m conspiracy theory anti-science nut made case reopening schools staff inoculated. hear experts say, simply think it’s risk don’t take disease don’t fully understand yet. Thanks links. think overstating CDC position bit (I think saying there's conflict, kind punting question), reading tend agree position.

My original point really challenge original statement (I actually know), somewhat baldly asserted. Hot glue valve then. Hot glue guns like $2 Walmart solve issue. 🖖😷 Biggest crossover since Spiderman showed Civil War. Ah yes, Florida California. Completely different story representative majority whatsoever. even though others get vaccinated, still plague, see seems really want origin, want witchhunt. Sort controversial sanity, always, always. literally 8th December 2020. wrong ? I'm Orange County. name least half dozen restaurants never closed within 5-minute drive. know best tool compared distancing closing schools eating outise tents weird inconvenient things address this? I'm things, I'll admit seen solid data comparing effectiveness different strategies. really know effective is. MF one step closer triangle zanthar That’s person full shit. risk patients vaccinated, would young people go lives? Hopefully we'll see something like J&amp;J. actually going deliver 100M vaccines end June they'll need ship something range 5-10m vaccines per week May June, depending March April. Currently they're experiencing delays, expecting 2M vaccines *all February*, I'm holding breath. OK. understand PCR test always run number cycles. keep running \*up to\* amount cycles. detect positive result then, need keep running cycles. 


So ask tests 35 fewer cycles, mean lower many cycles running, even labs running 45. means use tests dinged earlier. Good thing Covid minor virus young people even notice catch it. really hope ""X hosted superspreader event"", superspreader event defined 2-2,000 people, go die fire.

At point like olden days go back events people get sick next day.  employer fire employee absolutely reason, matter absurd (not I'm necessarily saying absurd), EXCEPT person fired reason protected civil rights law. Wish could trade Newsom him... also fire people smoke? Training insane, profit-driven incentives hellscape American work culture... Good things there's teachers schools also less fourth population California. Wait COVID fucks balls? destructive murder, robbery assault?

Guess commits that? That's messed up!!! give work complete home? school district homeschooling options homebound students works kids sick extended periods time, like Mono cancer, surgery something. thought schools I've taught 3 states now. form filled doctor believe. teachers send work home, drop off, parents pick up, teachers actually go teach home either full time job optional school kind job. Also Google classroom helps. It’s also BS metric workplaces, too, studies shown people productive 40 hours 35 30. means someone physically present, longer. I'll honest, read first little inner egoistical monster came said well... good right care getting protected asap. 

Then, made aware lack vaccines third world countries impact well... risk mutations mean vaccines end might end ineffective. Hol Wtf, state prioritizes smokers? Hmm. Kinda rude.

What personally want patience wait teachers vaccination sending back school.

In fact, would like patience wait us place anyone wants vaccination gotten one teachers live alone. live households un-vaccinated family members.

They say early summer everyone wants vaccine one, rush send people back school buildings short months away making everyone safe? 

They sending teachers back new contagious strains gaining momentum. insanity. pretty much admit bad idea demanding vaccination requirement employment September. 

They double standard logic serves slap face. Go check South African second wave. Started dropping straight 2 weeks went 6 week hard lockdown manditory face mask time. got first shots yesterday. 

Our biggest ealth insurer medical research council speculating 50% cogid based blood donation excess death data. ridiculous considering haven’t even vaccinated teachers yet LA. saving grandma March 2020

That mistake, clear early march Covid minor virus worth lockdown measures, people protested rioted time instead people cowering fear spinning save grandma narrative we'd avoided lockdowns much better position. May due stuff like this. Dunno I’m scientist know much Israel even. It’s best solution requires level administration would severely hamper rollout speed, harm good. big cities California completely shutdown. Even rogue spots operating, still hardest shutdown country. couldn’t anything months ago LA. yet everywhere governments possible reopen schools...

Attendance cards still thing

And work, sick days still looking bad, paid less paid, punished sick productive time society accepted ways seen bad, matter reason...

Such poor understanding production people, people come work sick infect people, instead paying 3 sick day fully 1 employee company end paying 1 sick day 70% 100 employees somehow congratulate attendance savings...

And people die... amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  mean, *think* kidding (I sure hope so, anyway!)... 1.6M total. 900k *first doses*. Shit. It’s learning Voltron. gotta stop merge super coronavirus. They're trending countries either using vaccines using non-Pfizer vaccines well though exact story. First twelve years life privileged- dad decided didn’t like us (me mom) leave town start real city. cool enough never pay child support either- dope. Asymptotic means gonna get teachers sick like Trojan horse. Man, multiply 100 answer get percentage.

[Here's formula come Democratic yes men think sending people actively sick virus targets old people old people housing facilities good idea. 21k people ages 45-54 died Covid. 460k dead, that's 4 half percent deaths entire age group. still absolutely significant risk numbers stand point. 

Sure, 20x riskier sounds like lot, comparing like, .02% chance death. put things perspective numbers wise, 75 year old 220x likely die COVID. want diminish lives lost high risk group, absolutely travesty, we're looking things nationwide perspective measuring risk, real numbers mean. Thanks! Really good detail there. Imagine offended piece cloth keeps old people safe terrible death 90 days think Plenty people would volunteer get trial right testing one dose (plus one placebo) verse two doses. people won’t chance get vaccinated summertime. analysis also even including Novavax AZ, could potentially turn surge tsunami April/May.  think testing everyone vaccinated. I'm sure outside that. doubt even know yet, would hard set anything early anyway.

It's also WAY sold lol think you’re misinterpreting OP’s statement. 100% would taken year end life spend 29th year living world without concerts, shows, large scale events, festivals, etc. Shut nerd. Dormitzer, **one Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists co-author study**, said interview believes current vaccine **highly likely still protect concerning variant first discovered South Africa**.  level neutralizing antibodies may order third half level neutralizing antibodies see original virus **does mean third half protection level, may well full protection**,” Pretty much worthless statistic. First dose already highly protective. example, Moderna, 92% effective pandemic ends much faster.

Unless immunity fades quickly we're back started fall. real risk immunity fades quickly second shot effective; would disaster would certainly prolong pandemic. week slow due horrible weather across country. Sucks, hopefully make next week. focus things realistically slowly work toward larger issues.

Yes let's rid world disease mutation incubators represented ~50 million mink killed per year bother 70 billion animals killed annually (and threat pose creating lethal pandemics) hard reason?? effort would entirely tokenistic. said all. Give everyone two doses find subset volunteers willing take risk participate, finding may challenge Science says certain measures place community spread certain levels. Almost nothing done schools besides mandatory mask wearing. Even social distancing non-existent. does, means that's obviously reffering to. year. literally neurons brain dedicated facial recognition. stiffling collective well-being robbing us shared humanity. less, minor things: 
\- *committed* 200M end March 400 end June. *expect* 220M end March 400M end May.  
\- They've shipped 86.5M doses, scheduled ship 15.5M doses next week. hit 200m doses end March need ship 100M doses four weeks, average \~25M/week. slightly less double, accounting recent increases. Hmmm ... sites allowed listed, one??? Strange say? think Fauci threw cold water Ah. minute faster last minute can't say vaccine delivery increasing. Got it. Genocide human rights violations weren’t enough, guess, lmao. bright side, suicides decreased due Covid Province! What’s worse people wine people preference former teacher would want return classroom asap without teachers getting vaccine. bother chose to; students. mask mandates place 50 states

I think locales, mask mandates may ""officially"" go away long time. one rules like ""No walking elephant 7pm Thursdays"" see places forgotten never enforced.

States maybe different story though. Seems low. appears wants return they've even second shot time take effect. across country actions tells plan rest lives. cool. Feel free distribute doses British factory counteract Indian propaganda buckle didn’t bother all. Lost promising business young man due 9/11. built solid career bought house, lost housing crisis. current position higher convention business, god damn feel like can't catch break, know I'm relatively lucky, things considered. There's military necessary evil. like it, change fact. . Absolute strawman, never said military evil unnecessary, also never said like it.

Yep, true, didn’t go back far thread. that’s relevant last question asked would hire instead. There's also: better recruitment strategy works I'm sure they'd love hear it.. said nothing recruitment strategies outside ones targeted children, he's assigning opinion never said.

That’s strawman, that’s mean, frankly. He’s misconstruing argument way he’s addressing argument. implying without recruiting children enough people military? 

Nope - I’m reiterating guy’s question (hence quotation marks). don’t know enough topic say either way, average age people enlisting 21.

...by admission, average age 21, youngest enlist branch appears 17, means depending definition “children” (do think 18? 20? 21?) means half new recruits children. least, “very young adults”. feel you’re “good at”? Genuinely curious. Yes seeing eyes public terrible thing. appears wants return they've even second shot time take effect. kind society you’re still going produce. one said that. appears wants return they've even second shot time take effect. Correction: Vaccine delivery increasing last week United States.

Of course, there's excellent excuse that. Again, preaching goddamn choir. want world police. want live country cares people even THINKS foreign countries. Yep. too. Really love wife, like around right I'm finding exceptionally annoying. know mental health shit right now. getting fat also.

I'm 2 year old daughter want good life her, I'm busy right divorce, want really get divorce many reasons. 

I'm hoping beyond hope right return normalcy might help whole situation. shit, I’ve spend whole visa Canada indoors man.. shit hurts That's xenophobic racist even think people stupid know use public transport, drive, use internet, contact health care provider ask get registered means. telling doctors hospital decide nothing knowing people access internet???

The way writing makes sound like minority races therefore marginalizing generalizing whole minority group saying know use/have access internet. Notice, talking old people whole; discussing racial aspect problem.

That's literally racist itself. bigot, really need check yourself. lmao, say that???? dont understand logic.... Entitled what? Vaccinations approved yes, ones haven’t. emergency use authorization we’re using, FDA approval. LOL shit, it’s highly likely it’s going get worse gets better. I’m already planted friend, here. repetitive argument isn’t saying much. america worlds police? global superpower? leader free world? said, america built international system forces everyone else play by. That’s 1 masks. We’d need least 1 per week probably 1 per day can’t sterilize properly. evidence vaccines US don’t provide strong protection known variants. evidence children, parents, public education system whole harmed keeping kids school. also real world evidence vaccines extremely effective. makes sense keep kids school hypothetical situation happening likely happen. makes teachers different essential workers coming work since day one?? Teaching person essential work. 

And yeah sure let’s put money tracking new variants, don’t disagree virus spreading like wildfire US. sitting saying vaccinating less? understand logic I'm medical expert pretend one. But, believe regions high occurrence male pattern baldness. Covid-19 appears hit male pattern baldness patients hardest. There's also rumblings Australia completely closing borders citizens, except case-by-case basis. So, there's that.

That's ridiculous. Stuff like beyond stupid.  Jesus Christ. depressed, spending two days week helping people sort unemployment issues/issue Food Bank Vouchers doesn’t help. particularly bad day dismissals spurious causes upbeat call youngest hitched positive sounding boyfriend also connected inspirational educator cheered end. still hope there. never since society decided risk something must fully eliminated. yet employer longer granting COVID leave, requesting medical leave absence disqualifies unemployment insurance. Yaaaaay. glad India fulfilling roll potential superpowers  1 mask per person 328 million masks assuming get discount, could cost $150-$300million. Yeah fucking way. can’t accept another spring/summer 100% canceled. pretty much death sentence life another 10 months.  obvious idea world? going force people spend hours every day rooms groups people raging pandemic, least offer vaccine first. Understood. Thank clarification. hope wrong, feelings arbitrary situation look like problem scientific knowledge virologists suggests likely 1 dose plan save lives. also know 1 dose plan safe.

So do? Go plan science tells save lives plan trial?

Trials scientic evidence have. consider understanding immune system we've observed 1 dose.

If experts tell us plan save lives I'm happy that. so... FORCE everyone accept risk? uh... what?? lol Even pathetic number, started beginning Feb, that's still half million week 😊 go every week. Also, get saying. ""We reach herd iunity first reaching others"" get it. think things could done assist less developed nations. Becuase, whats point ""eliminating"" virus developed countries going keep spreading like wildfire everywhere else? actually quoting president macron vaccine information. Jesus fucking Christ. Fur attractive practical (it warm) point fake stuff job well enough satisfy fashion alternatives work well need warm clothing point fur industry basically die. It'll never go away entirely, there's need huge farms/industry point. never said care rest world. said government care people rest world. cared yet, hence rest world cared yet.

This logic literally every country earth uses, reason US one country cares others own? Nah fuck off. odds covid killing remotely low. Isn’t body choice. Heck even military isn’t making mandatory yet Portugal? article:

Colorado far identified 67 cases “variants concern” state. prominent among U.K. variant, known scientifically B.1.1.7. variant part clade 20I.

Herlihy said variants still make small percentage overall cases “at point, we’re really seeing clear trend.” 

But, regardless variant, playbook remains same: social distancing, mask-wearing hand-washing.

“The strategies we’ve using last couple months,” Herlihy said, “are really strategies going effective decreasing transmission variant.” Anecdotally, I’m part phase III trial went back week unblinding. amount people got one dose placebo vaccine. offering one shot vaccine people got one shot placebo. indicates tracking one dose efficacy. Yeah, what's chance 95% efficacy? I'd say low. boost production mRNA vaccines much possible. would basically double supply, cost would using dose regiment gone significant testing. risk either immunity starts wear quickly second shot longer effective.  city Bay Area, Alameda county. There’s lots cities Bay don’t want dox hard fully trust online reviews even person interacting with. negative online reviews may written competitors trying scare people buying company, even people reselling may that. person comments may work company posted positive comments basically advertise product. least one variant current vaccines less effective against, dangerously so, seen phenomenon. continue allow unrestricted spread infections via mass gatherings, new variants inevitable. future effectiveness current vaccines mutations exist yet literally unknowable. demand teachers required teach regardless consideration vaccinated short sighted. 

Did know less 0.2% labs currently equipped genetic testing necessary identify track variants? Part new covid bill includes money increase 50% aren’t flying blind like undeveloped failing state are. Idk live people can't get vacation people 20s need sustain study, sure fuck universal started whole thread claim one's 20s universally sacred. Another misleading headline without context.

All vaccines potential side-effects, healthcare staff also experiencing these, resulting take day two recover receiving vaccine injection.

The recommendation stagger vaccine injections among staff, need recover time.

Yet another thing learned pandemic, 20-20 hindsight seems blatantly obvious, wasn't. Aren’t 1 3 adults generally depressed anxious? People always talk ""back normal"" rarely see discussion actually work. Certain things exact date attached them, curious people's predictions dates that:

* Daily deaths US double digits (7 day avg)
* Daily cases US 10,000 (7 day avg)
* Walmart officially drops mask policy nationwide 
* mask mandates place 50 states
* remaining restrictions place indoor dining entire US shit Wolf warrior diplomacy.

You wonder they're trying achieve nonsense like this. meant intimidate us submission? so, profoundly fail understand Western mindset. look like bunch 5-year-olds.

Is meant make look strong domestically? would make sense, still use wolf warrior technique social media sites Chinese citizens allowed use. news 6 months late. variants exist, blown proportion.  said safe? Macron talked effectivity, safety. got moderna shot 3 weeks ago since I've seen efficacy numbers 80-90% range single dose really wish could give 2nd dose someone else understand trying point mate.

Like, license agreement BioNTech Pfizer. contracts. Yep. Dont drink water! Deep State putting tracking chips it! awful kind stress sure hope things get better you. bet way lot people right now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hearing teachers want head back class vaccinated? seems like putting straw-man effigy prod public come pitchforks bonfires. belies entire argument teacher's unions pleading prioritized. think hesitant reluctant they'd say ""essential"" work groups like farm laborers, grocery clerks, food service employees get shot first? say instead trying paint sort Indian vaccine, developed domestically, shared world. 

Also, AstraZeneca/Oxford sold cost everywhere. pretty easy catch high-school level material online.

Education disparities bad enough is. we're enforcing catch-up side lower classes. talk equity, we're really dropping ball here. Sorry I'm Chinese. goes argument. Joke's them. depressed anxious even Covid-19. food deliveries? US really set aside couple billion prefund projects like this. 

Surveillance initial development series vaccines new strains come up. way well way one starts significantly evading immunity. Work, society always sent sick kids school work. households parents work 9-5 kid school, parents might able take day care sick kid, give extra Tylenol say good luck. 
 
And problem beyond schools employers, crappy enough fire employees taking day take care sick kid. know also concerns providing partial immunity raises odds selecting vaccine resistant strain. Granted, slow rollout way. There's definitely enough nuance I'm gonna try backseat quarterback. remember, ton fake ones China. SII manufactured 50 million doses risk phase 3 trials even knew vaccine worked - that's enough doses donate rest world.

Much richer companies like JnJ stockpile even though billions cash - US shortages.

Their role pandemic commendable. anxious WAYYYY COVID 19... least i’m part something rn correct understanding efficacy 1 shot 91%, two shots 94%? 


 
If that's true, considering current shortage supply, would insane give almost anyone two shots. That's another person wait vaccinated, increase efficacy 3% first person. would even consider continuing that? come across bit unhinged respond like that. Here’s link saw: particular quote: “ highly protective first dose, benefits derived scarce supply vaccine could maximized deferring second doses priority group members offered least one dose.” someone BC CDC. 

I thought heard Pfizer said something effect, sure now. find test population though? realize order would need someone *volunteer* receive one dose, possible risk gaining immunity subsequently getting infected and/or ill. Fair enough, America certainly regressing developed status see life expectancy falling middle class vanishing dear sir madam, would like respectfully agree disagree.

Day 1 involved coworker coughing work socially ridiculed (jokingly) didn’t know much virus it’s symptoms. Words like “social distancing” didn’t exist yet, went lunch together coughing coworker sitting us. One lunch attendee Type 1 diabetes, one 50 two immuno-compromised. laughed coughing coworker mentioned going dinner elderly parents night. knew nothing, except virus existed made way America.

That next day, told pack desks leave office 2 weeks wait news. Schools area also shut down. rumors started flying potential symptoms wash mail deliveries received. mass chaos confusion. next months involved world learning virus impact real-time. realize sure rate severe cases low children young people. know day 1. Maybe like day 48. Seriously, it'll likely time next school year starts, proper in-person schooling constantly disrupted threat outbreaks happen. Assuming normal school year starting fall, it'll probably less year non in-person class, hardly going end world. I've seen high school courses catch major disruption practically wrote entire year material; one year partially online (which even complete write-off) likely minor setback most.

Also, thing schools associated transmission there's much community spread contact tracing near useless right now. one's going able find smoking gun link school \*the\* cause outbreak right now, absolutely mean they're safe. We've seen pictures crowded hallways Georgia high school know risk factors covid are; pretending schools somehow magically exception known risks ridiculous. \^ - Wonder hard people say. could basically double supply free, right? Yeah is, except Foxconn selling iPhones profit margin iPhones saving lives fucking absurd. vaccine could still provide enough antibodies effectively neutralize virus yet fucks still fear monger clicks. need open everything get back normal. variants going dealing multiple mental disorders media caused. Yeah, seems like best take. necessarily able gather large groups winter, large events must planned months advance, planning necessarily possible right now. problem planning restrictions, likely. anyone know google would block that? Seems weird whether lockdowns theoretically work kinda irrelevant reality never will. Florida deaths per capita California open. That's spread happens indoors mostly family members roommates other, outdoor dining indoor shopping masks, etc. say ""fuck it"" entirely yea keep businesses open precautions closing actually slow spread, bankruptes businesses. Becuase already terrified half country, might well go full nine yards I’m sure supposed feel confident buying stuff counterfeits everywhere companies like Amazon aren’t held accountable them. Can’t buy directly 3M. hope 5 people okay depressed anxious J&amp;J dose would also efficacy ~70%, less Pfizer's single dose regimen data hold true. mentioned western superiority complex - immediately went race.

I think says racial obsession mine. Hey y'all! damn helpful [last website, wanted show video! 50 sources amazing guest contributions. Thanks support help last time site! got lot great info community want continue helping folks better understand new vaccines. sounds like vial pressurised. Maybe it’s fact mRNA vaccine? sounds like it’s much delicate vaccines. biggit, want grandma die /s I'm anxious Karen confront wearing mask. country in? life good Minnesota. going Mexico Saturday im excited! asking real questions California prioritizing university professors college teachers returning anytime year. make sense. People care science, want shot. take twist every bit data rave getting shot. 

Hence subreddit went ""protect vulnerable!"" ""give shot fuck grandma"" vaccine came out. I'd disagree

For concert, probably would pay less attendance.

But festival experience much people performers 67% parents want continue remote learning asked CPS survey. given opportunity attend person learning, 20% parents actually sent kids school. 

Why shouldn’t parents get choice whether feel safe sending children back? dangerous. I'm going Mexico Saturday can't wait! yeah also idea Americans October winter returns.

What makes say that? good chance thing mostly October partly right, proportion would anxious depressed people impacted lockdowns? People lost jobs, homes, children unable go school, people trapped home abusers. could go on, nothing virus direct consequence cruel loss freedoms life makes sense. would thought time still needed learn this.

Is applicable vaccines? never really knew anxiety covid happened. least better emphasize effected anxiety disorders get last part.

Also Hoskins effect? never convince two three adults OK normal times would problem moment doses bottleneck money. best part festivals (Outside music course) anything goes. sweaty ten thousand peopls faces hugging, dancing, drinking, without care free feeling same. Years ago forced write finals kid bad case chicken pox. start making ridiculous send kid school sick, think easy would make frowned upon go office sick!

I immune system problem; basically immune system. get sniffles, end hospital. last year isolation staying home get sick. really abnormal me. get really pissed people come work looking like warmed death. happen? keep date buy ones still list. reputable US middle-man would still sell those. DeSantis put Wood Chipper,..... although India developing country, really strong comes manufacturing. surprised giving away vaccines poorer countries. long vaccinate first. 

But understand US really resources give vaccines away. US EU alliance. paid billions doses. see hands another country? way. would understand maybe helping thy neighbor (mexico canada). sending middle east africa? unless attain sort deal. US afterall.

Anyway. give free. tiny fraction yes. least 98% given americans first. Illegal legal citizen matter point. matters vaccinating folks currently living US soil EDC May? I'm EDM fan I'm yearning festival experience.

Any restrictions? n95's cover valve something. Remember salary breakdown see frustration Oregonians teachers. let childcare workers currently working person continue work $13/hr, make $70k cut line vaccine, won’t even come back teaching. guess consider much valuable childcare workers worthy vaccine despite agreeing teach person again. Yes, restrictions capacity. Closed places, think. mutated detectable ? they? contact many people every day could get exposed South African variant. Since even Biontech less effective makes sense stay safe. That's Americans October winter returns. long strict lockdown stay-at-home measures stay place middle next year (which definitely should), believe achieve Covid-free society. new variants emerging well, makes wonder social distancing mask wearing enforced even achieve Covid-zero road.

And suddenly plummet rates everything coming rushing vaccines keep going staying scares huge signal beacon end pandemic coming sooner rather later crazy be. I’m wearing three bullet proof vests take 2 still get shot chest, still protected? also see real possibility lot people sociable Covid become wayyyy depressed Covid see people socializing like crazy restrictions lifted. heard hospitals given similar number doses regardless size. large UPMC facility get enough vaccinate healthcare workers patient contact smaller community hospital got roughly number doses enough vaccinate workers without patient contact even left affiliates. South Dakota*

Montana also dropped restrictions. Wisconsin also ruled mask mandate unconstitutional, plus NY officials trying strip Cuomo emergency powers (which means longer mandate masks lockdown). think happens extra vials? get send countries, it’s hand full countries actually vaccinate population. billions people need vaccinated. makes sure get earlier. indoor dining open capacity another country right now? know California even Portland got back. always post articles immediately comment ""now wait sub x z"" anyone said anything? looking trouble lmao mean guess. envy right tbh. I'm glad kids bullshit. vaccines widely available, it’s time start firing people shutting travel, concerts, sporting events. We’ll see quickly idiots hold out. might point here:

Some German epidemiologists estimate bureaucratic lag 4 8 weeks. widespread AZ campaign might enough slow virus bureaucrat speed, preventing last straw measures. Didn’t cdc say everyone wear two? don’t know, assumed that’s Biden Harris it. Yes, this. let go expectations thus let go disappointment helped anxiety. foundation partner strong accepted is. peoples feelings actions control live what's best myself, letting anyone anything get badly before. freeing life changing. way handle toxic relationship stuck together due pandemic. situation personally. one hoarding vaccines secret stash white house. understand argument, surely comes point 20% extra efficiency 85-year-old second dose valuable 80% efficacy 55-year old first dose.

In practice, thinking priority line vaccinations, decision needs made.

I'm convinced ""give many people possible first dose"" always best strategy. I'm sorry AZ vaccine safe. data say unsafe.

And huge Phase IV trial UK 5 million vaccinated AZ vaccine (all 65) also shows safe.

I'm sorry EU vaccine rollout going badly, mistakes EU mistakes mentally ill crackpot Macron.

Spreading lies vaccines make EU rollout go better, know. make go worse result part world still lockdown end year economy shreds full blown banking crisis along it. I'd rather set example ditching masks vaccinated. people control country goddamn averse positive incentives? Pre covid 100% attended school cold, yes friends caught too. Absolutely. Florida fared better? 

If California ""well"" Florida, 10,000 Californians would've died. 

I get complicated every state/region different every state's data testing efforts/#'s different but... cmon man. Yep. scrotal balls eyeballs ... Spoken like true infant. Go bed child. happen UK sadly Teachers Union pretty strong bugs far pandemic still this, widely known takes weeks effective, coupled false sense security people first shot, easily taint figures Sorry worked retail years. Taking time sick unheard unless actually dying. flu tried take one day manager said bring doctor's excuse else, go could afford health insurance. see would take position bill gates says probably

Trump may White House superspreader. (Not trolling here: really think may one.) know burning comedian school? data FDA appears show roughly 93% efficacy two weeks first Pfizer dose, compared roughly 95% efficacy two weeks second dose, raises uncomfortable question me. I’m supposed get second Pfizer dose days, wouldn’t dose increases immunity 93% 95% better used increase vulnerable person’s immunity 0% 93%? effectively wasting half vaccine supply whole time?

Another thing leads question whether get second dose side effects. first dose, series bizarre frightening seizure-like experiences next several days, whole body suddenly started shaking violently lie take deep breaths went away. freaked leads worry lot second dose might do, considering everything I’ve heard indicates second dose worse side effects. even rolling dice side effects increase immunity 2%? Precisely. sure people aren’t getting COVID deaths regardless whether they’re recorded not, silly think otherwise. definitely dropping. expected faster. rest world high cases dropping faster them.  Say millions already injected it. case, might better getting one vaccine might trouble talking anyone giving vaccine. I'm scheduled get first dose Pfizer next week. hope someday cult like Nostradamus following made based digital statements came true. Ok, watched [the interview seems like 2022 quote, like many, taken wayuuu context.

The reporter asked: “Can tell us something hopeful world looks like terms returning semblance normal life beginning 2022?”

And Fauci responded: “...Things get better better, particularly people get vaccinated. see dramatic diminution, continuation diminution new infections per day currently experiencing. So, hope things go well, get better months go by. And, hopefully, time enter 2022, degree normality approximate kind normality used to.”

So didn’t randomly throw 2022 finishing line; responding directly question 2022. imagine studying COVID accidentally discovered cure baldness? Wouldn’t something! Dunno wontfixnow lives tell works France.

Of course noone knows brand names vaccines even still. generally get prescription vaccine, buy vaccine pharmacy, stick fridge head doctors day two. vaccines probably stop those. probably meant say uvula.
From possible coughing. Ah, [master Covid They're looking across entire population. variable controlled across population. might enough data younger age groups get significant corellation. need study age group independently. like anything data. hospitals figure risk severe illness. conditions increase risk across age groups, though. data assume rule, exception.

My wife got married October 2019, got pregnant like mid-January, BOOM...life changes like that. 

I already moved away 8 hours family, miss anything world, would days/weeks still adjusting that. unable come see us I'm expecting first child awful. pregnant wife pandemic awfully stressful. Making decisions people come see child/if come/who come...etc etc.

None friends met little girl. one close uncle outside immediate family wife's immediate family. almost 5 months. really hard take anywhere (an empty coffee shop early morning that's it). 

I feel extra lonely isolated. shit Hell personally. fucking HATE seeing masks still even though pro-mask love help people stay safe. I'm it. cannot wait vaccine. 

And that's top natural human empathy suffered way worse me, too. Nope physical health fine throughout pandemic go threads people dying saying ""It's fever mild soreness, what's big deal?""

It's insensitive, people get probably enjoy pandemic lack social skills handle normal life.  information source telling teachers risk? Look table 1 study. Mean age BMI similar 2 groups. shown [Table COVID-19 positivity trended higher increasing baldness. Yea that's true known days now. maybe couple weeks.

Q1 6 million total (4 million Pfizer + 2 million Moderna).

Q2 supposed 20 million doses. Pfizer upper 8 million 10.8 million. means Moderna delivering 12 million Q2. adds roughly 23 million.

Together, adds 29 million. many places even give paid time. That's blame people forcing work sick. So, that’s no? Fake Lol ape math. bad numbers. Superdepress super anxiety. controlled age BMI. 

I understand many comments saying ""well could age"" study linked to, controlled that. Can’t believe China would lie us like that. Ah yes, COVID what’s making people depressed. Yep, disease itself. Or... hear hiur here... simply feel mental health fine throughout pandemic? He’s dead. Hey look talking me! realize statistics require expertise make inference right. high school stats class calculating averages. even analyze true raw data this, would take much statistician data scientist said:

“I mean, Manatee County doesn’t like us this, totally fine putting counties want it,” DeSantis said. “And we’re totally happy anyone that’s saying that, let us know want us send Sarasota next time, Charlotte, Pasco, wherever, let us know we’re happy it. think people opportunity bring vaccines efficiently think they’re gonna want it.”

I don’t see threat there! writer merely paraphrasing threat long promise dance TikTok lol feeling March/April, we’re gonna get ton articles op-eds saying saved 100,000+ people dying flu year wearing masks social distancing. We’ll probably see commercials Fauci Osterholm saying well. product food shortages? Seem non yet. Also 2 months in....give time ffs. Ah. expectation people buys valved N95s glue valves? certainly clear earlier discussion focused wearing two masks instead. me, doesnt explain downvotes, 🤷‍♂️ controlled age BMI. Thank :) Hmm ... give short doses??? issue shit comms around whole thing since start.

I hate keep harping New Zealand, ... single coordinated response government single source truth. Public health experts clear likely take couple years clear up, going back last year. clear short long term goalposts leading metrics people could monitor see relative bigger goal.

In US, people can't accept bad news kind, led drip drip drip optimistic oh we'll see next month etc met well shit still bad next month. works couple months people get fed lose trust. Contributing fractal response across every level government.

IMO missed opportunity feds beginning. pandemic national/global threat kind thing like war feds prepared for, response ready roll out. states counties believe would absorbed plausible/credible federal plan. they've developed uniqueness emphasized way whole thing politicized. Wow, even 8 doses. Fantastic work, hopefully mean vaccinated faster. People follow precautions without needing restrictions tell do.

I live country death rate per million half UK rate, population density significantly higher. didn’t lockdown winter.  husband told specifically take anything vaccine. conservatives still find something complain about!  You’re probably going downvoted sentiment, although agree part you’re saying. I’m mask burning parties subreddit discussion thread anticipates summer however see nothing wrong wearing mask volition think might sick, cough similar symptoms heightened cold/flu months. It’s literally top recommendation FBI spot fake n95 masks. There’s another post sub right includes recommendation.

Typo’s exist, market flooded fakes fakes could contribute death, spelling grammar mistakes critical ensure authenticity. year *so far* include impacts surviving covid long term health effects. Ah alright makes liiiiitle sense 3 sick days insane. Like, literally one flu out. wonder. Perhaps quarantined older (70+) people fragile health people kept society open mask wearing higher sanitation. crisis really hurting millennials zoomers like 2008 Recession facilitating greater concentrations wealth businesses. bet society opens we're gonna see austerity people lost jobs businesses, young people hurt worse this. think overreacted. Ohhhhh dont like haha. Don’t forget brexit/uk -bad, EU-good pay matter what, even drug would failed trials pay. gamble One country one vote. political statement reelection soon. distribution states issue, state's distribution was. Look new york vaccines going waste find enough minority groups give giving anyone else law.

And averaging 1 million doses per day Joe took office. get sentiment 20s going slip this, even year. people say mental health fine throughout pandemic give energy people say they're risk see getting little sick big deal. Yes! Agreed!!!! think thing normal things there’s stigma it. least among people know there’s gossip who’s traveling going restaurants.

I’m guessing lot lifted people get vaccinated. plan going back pretty much normal life post vaccination except wearing mask months longer protect others. I'd like research breaks ""long covid"" different categories. instance, agree would pretty unpleasant recurrent low fever six months, coughing episodes every morning six months, that's definitely persistence symptoms kind long covid. would worse unpleasant really serious symptoms, fatigued get bed, chronic hives, debilitating headaches, etc. 

If 10% get long covid 95% low fevers unpleasant life-destroying symptoms, I'm much less scared 10% get long covid half can't work six months.  Lyme disease teens persistent symptoms year, relatively minor impact life much, instance.

All research I've seen breaks ""people persistent symptoms"" three months six months. suspect alien abductions ... /s COVID 19 stay like many, many years would saddening us. unstoppable trend likewsie. know it’s disappointing lose opportunities feeling like time passing by, 20’s last chance fun. many people 30’s even better 20’s filled traveling, friends, adventures. Keep moving forward safe! Don’t let tell need meds mentally ill. Anxiety depression normal reactions this! you’re anxious depressed, wonder you! Yeah, career stuff point esp second time short time working world. Makes hard care anymore 4.0 college GPA high point career. Get Reddit. people it. Precautions part routine now.

I'm sure guys much better morale places expectation work sick. also bet guys cut dead weight way employee ""exploit"" generous view sick days.

Seriously, hope direction leading company becomes norm exception. Priority #1A get shots arms fast humanly possible. Get shot it’s turn fact didn’t even google see “n95 masks sale” less results “sideshow Bob fellating Rick Sanchez sitting pineapple” fucking hysterical exactly needed today rise social media clearly exacerbated lock down. Granted lockdowns done correctly, half-assed lockdown year probably would've able human contact like New Zealand achieved “The timeline shows additional vaccine candidates given green light Health Canada, 24.5 million Canadians could fully vaccinated end June, though Pfizer-BioNtech Moderna shots number immunized Canadians timeframe 14.5 million.” Correct. Another 1/3 adults depressed don’t understand symptoms. though happen sometimes weather like this.

There theory teachers commute place internet access hold class... seems unlikely.  strange- see 5-10 different vendors click link, including CostCo, Ace Hardware, local vendors. haven’t clue what’s going on. seems low think assume isn’t though. live province averaging 350-400 cases per day December January. 13,000 1.1 million people fully vaccinated. Mostly healthcare workers old folks homes. haven’t gotten general elderly public yet. hardest hit areas remote northern regions haven’t vaccinated yet.

Our cases per day dropped 50 percent last three weeks. Deaths haven’t dropped yet.

We don’t even strict restrictions here. Beyond meetings 5 house, restaurants *and* bars still open. actually never closed weeks last April May. Schools open year. Yes. Exactly. Yes!! Let's hope pandemic least bring change treat people I'll. 3 years ago son 3, got strep throat almost every month 4 months, daughter symptoms therefore test (another bs rule needs change). Finally 4 months doc tested positive strep asymptomatic carrier. let school nurse know confirmed kids normal strep since showing symptoms send anyway. doc sent letter school board able complete assignments home 2 weeks. Kids basically germ virus storage distribution facilities schools employers need realize this. large study... hundred people. People keep forgetting vaccine partnership Oxford University (UK Govmnt funded) drug manufacturer.

The UK Government invested research UK Manufactiuring plant well vaccine proved work. incidentally particular vaccine sold cost.

AstraZeneca also factories Germany EU countries not? inability meet needs EU nothing UK. EU thanking UK great price getting. thing. people people much deeper, troubling issues. wearing masks sick needs brought every time someone says sick wearing them.

Yes, would nice people wore sick make hate less. Went site N95 stock, almost 4$ piece them!! 

It’s amazing much going n power outages? could why? maybe expecting power outages. Nah fam, Zoom suck it. bad “nations” “investments” irrelevant viruses.

Ethical beliefs subjective preferences. favorite color magenta. like smell lemongrass. don’t like taste pickles. like movies sad endings. don’t like children victims sex trafficking.

Ethical beliefs simply preferences happen relate people treated, extension, preferences policies laws govern communities. Basically, whenever somebody says “X unethical” interpret shorthand “X related people treated, preferences strong aversion X”.

While acknowledge “ethical preferences” product various cultural biological factors, therefore subjective, nevertheless feel strongly must expend least time energy persuading others adopt preferences. Why? various cultural biological factors. understand origins “urge persuade” scientific perspective, knowledge reduce strength urge.

So, it’s preferences, possible persuade others?

Whenever try persuade somebody, usually assume that, basic axiomatic level, preferences similar other. arguments usually seek expose logical inconsistencies within worldview opponent. people find cognitive dissonance uncomfortable, approach sometimes effective.

On hand, point find disagree fundamental level, discussion usually worth having.

If understand correctly, value detached ethical constraints. value feeling freedom way thinking gives you. don’t believe entirely free. Surely horrors world, child sex trafficking, sadistic violence without cause, slavery, dislike? truly preferences people around treated? asthma whole life. health far important school. think he's going learn focus getting enough air day?

""After 28 days"" means ""after 28 days FOLLOWUP"", AKA entire 28-day period, vaccine efficacy 80%.

So yes, absolutely semantics. I've run vaccine trials myself, I've always referred followup manner.

Bottom line, semantics aside: OP exposed 11 days vaccination, best estimate 51%, got exposed within first half 28-day period. Realistically probably higher proximity 14-day cutoff point, is. report daily numbers. Go ahead downvote me

I still want know time released results study using actual full set mutations. see taking one time would show variant worked would useful answer well vaccine, actually plasma someone vaccinated, **full** variant.

the mutations leaving may may anything signifigance. starting bug pfizer moderna studies, done already released results.

so many countries putting hope stoping pandemic hands buying products. reallyt oo much ask this? absolutely correct.

So rephrase. hit benchmark above, ***additional*** failure regards United States America. Biden mentioned well town hall, moving ""spring"" late July anyone wants vaccine. dad worked factory growing up. got gereric awards perfect attendance year year. Plaques, medals, special certificates, etc. think got 13 years something perfect attendance.. Lord knows many times went feel best expected employer. case couldn’t get rid award since basically penalizes kids truly sick staying home? Sorry, trouble finding ""tiny micro cuts brain"" searching term scientific journals.

Fuckin idiot. find surprising though. knew back March last year would long haul vaccines would way mess. wonder quickly build huge government facilities. China build temporary hospital like 5 days? appreciated Biden realist say what's popular. seem understand Palestinians Canaanites well descendants remaining Jews Judah. 😆 Like what? OMG yes! capable administer 50000 doses one day. whole infrastructure already there, give shots? Elimination strategies reduce restrictions. best. wear 3 first 1 offered protection? fair it’s kinda starting seem like might hitting little bit right now. 1 star reviews worth look think I'm going keep wearing masks. They're kind of... fun match outfits make different kind statements with. I'm going miss freedom expression normal anymore. meant see chefs waiters wearing masks time longer. people eating. played out.

#COVID19 I'm super pro science pro vaccine think I'm waitress this.

We know impacts vaccine fertility pregnancy. say article husband trying. takes time know pregnant. Add vaccine 2 doses taken weeks apart theres chance pregnant receives shots. 

On side, understand need restaurant protect customers. Overall difficult situation. feel least, restaurant tried work put non customer facing role. (Maybe did, dont see statement restaurant story)

Also, saying irresponsible trying get pregnant pandemic. even baby end 2021, dont understand stance. Cases also consistently dropping global level well, good sign think Man can’t catch break COVID mutates like cold flu likely never will. become endemic. Check countries.  Parents don’t anywhere else take kid can’t miss work. preschool teacher, parents would drop sick kids giving Advil lower fever knowing they’d called pick hours, least wasn’t full call day them. think need help parents put situation, like time types family emergencies, profit companies don’t want factor in. schools get paid students attending lose money students absent.  poor policy. real statistic? know, feel thats weekends for. remember going safari africa. elephants really chill. left. Later got email one guests safari us. stayed another session left. said something spooked elephants giant stampede. rushed vehicle slightly sheltered area hoping elephants would avoid nook. 

I feel like never know. wild animals strength kill us.

That said, id go another safari lol. think come alive anyway. We’re biologically social apes best can. don’t blame people emotionally reacting idea many months (possibly years) restrictions social contact. get point point article, think it’s unrealistic given current climate divert attention resources balanced methods living within vaccinated population. 

Either way. Cheers. I’ve always thought perfect attendance stupid kind ableist. showing warm body really important thing? 

Like got flu, pinkeye, chicken pox. Fuck dragging school spreading it.

I condition shitty HMO insurance wanted see pediatric specialist two hours away. don’t weekends. important see pediatric provider growth wasn’t stunted.

A friend spine condition multiple surgeries, requiring extensive recovery. used wheelchair crutches things needed exchanged adjusted grew. time out. Grainger.com 3m N95s sale right (albeit valve) put surgical mask valve good. sick days speak of? Here’s anecdotal story. Recovered Covid 3 months ago. Raynauds Disease fingertips. Never before. new autoimmune disease. wonder go away eventually. \*Companies supported least partially funded countries they're in. ""food insecurity"" means nothing lol. Check it. Europe conservative tolerant beliefs. American christianity comparison seems form extremism (for lack better wording) 


For example Europe less importance given form Christianity one adheres (ironically enough, think due shift towards protestantism anglicism open minded honour ''bound'' (traditional / conservative) sect Christianity) 


In Europe essentially enough Christian faith God chastised this. mutual ground respect even agnostics consider christian deeper questions life share questions human individuals experiencing collective experience called life. 


Also much less importance commercialisation. TV evangelicism find America considered blasphemy here. Yes televised services priest pastor rolls royce telling people donations private bank account save soul actually comes across usurping mitigating message Christianity Judaism based / compunded upon.  Virus work way. lots people infected, lots get infected. long people available infected. conditions November favorable spread conditions February. 

Yes Christmas something it, something infected enough people get level immunity built up. Covid gone easter!! mean? lol true

I remember last April predicting cap 65k deaths end June would fade away. know turned out.

I doubt they’re exaggerating; along lines “extreme” reports though, i’ll admit. That's suspected. Bald = older = deader. Man never thought I'd say this, actually disagree medical professionals, least ones pushing measures.

How ""professionals"" disregard mental health, social life economy? They're acting they're game main objective ERADICATE covid. Stop. fucking stop.

a life that's worth living sight, almost there. agree current lockdowns ""one last push"" vaccines rolled out, anything overkill. I've lost shit know I'm alone makes worse. even doubt even would achieve success. 

Then bring all? They're advocating claiming would work neither you. Moderna. Zero side affect 1st. Nothing. record, never got side effect flu shot ever.

I'm complaining mad EU, gotta make sure population gets vaccine.

I might well wrong, think EU bringing export control f$king reason.  TIL. Guess always assumed automatically would. Thanks!  Could list symptoms? ""Guys, can't like Canada""

""Yeah...nope"" think that's also true people posted bad covid long-term effects them? websites let schedule, there's reason someone cancer organ transplant able go ahead healthy 65 year old. afraid COVID-19 may stay like many, many years even vaccines authorized approved use alongside treatments. may like seasonal affliction then; however nonstop trend.

COVID-19 may never eradicated instead may mitigated even better completely greatly control.

Mitigate vs eliminate? Imagine wanting government mandated lockdowns. mild flu like symptoms 12 hours post vaccination, followed hangover feeling lasted couple days specifically talks havibf policies ""allow fuller opening Canada’s economy society throughout  radical COVID measures hurt economy. true: measures help economy, allowing resume normal functioning

That's excluded. spend good portion article talking it. matter? Look wearing masks done flu year, virtually eliminated it. culture wearing masks staying home sick risk spreading sickness would lot better off. look eastern countries fared much, much better pandemic US.

Frankly, hope get future people wearing masks flu season, etc. ones laughed shunned. said extreme lockdowns issue, came alternative masks, distancing, closures etc someone intends still somewhat cautious getting vaccine, point part help get cases way running rampantly population. 

There's also difference ""sticking restrictions"" ""sticking restrictions"". get vaccine I'm going lot I'm right now, everything used pandemic, least immediately. words, life 90% back normal, maybe wearing mask sometimes avoiding big indoor crowds. little kids able get vaccinated while, I'd rather expose unnecessarily virus, even though risk complications low. No, mean people still go work. Like said. Sorry see mention anything eradication covid. Social economics costs excluded suggestion. mention plan's success cost fields. seems like reduce covid near-zero, whatever costs... explain can't. can’t downvote saying facts. people ridiculous lmao. Oh I’m ultra optimistic, dare ! Doesn’t matter respond vaccine, they’re still problem right now. 12 years perfect attendance school. Blame mom. got college got sick lot. LOL graduated HS, girl class got special award perfect attendance 12 years. Cmon, sick 12 years?  Idk think elite class would want everything shutdown lol. Like power u would want things running normal. things running normally simply kick back exploit people like usual. literally stand nothing gain lot lose shutting things lmfao. CARES act *alone* $2.2T, comes $7,000 per person US. March 2020...

If mRNA vaccines cost $10,000 per person, would still worth it, strictly economic perspective, least US. quick google search says Moderna pricing $32-$37 range... That's basically free. Neither us? agree. don’t think remote work become norm. think accepted remote working days week fine. Despite hearing Twitter Google whatever tech company says permanent remote work ok, think companies still require face time (NOT APPLE FACETIME). 

I think people realizing miss face face interactions work. Even beginning like “ woohoo, never set foot office again!!! Mary annoying co-worker. I’m glad don’t hear impressions latest twist Bachelor!!”

I suspicious anyone makes claim absolute certainty something certain of. They're famous smart. Moderna might getting far less positive press coverage far EU far fewer doses Pfizer. newspapers focus Pfizer - makes sense, remarkably effective we've ordered lot - rather Moderna (also super effective havent ordered much) news papers sway public opinion. things like these, many people influenced knowing heard vaccine, sometimes people might even know Moderna similar vaccine.  literally showed sources.

holy wow, points creativity tho... mean suspending disbelief skill they're teaching us guess..... I'm reading news reports side effects AstraZeneca vaccine. Whole schools closed vaccinating staff people develop fever problems. true side effects common severe particular vaccine Pfizer/Moderna? hard data it? Man, really don’t want come ‘as soon I’m vaccinated I’m *done* guy’. REALLY don’t want come ‘power hungry government’ guy ... getting little Medical experts reminding public coronavirus pandemic still continue vaccinated, it’s important keep wearing mask.

I get idea mask wearing public chance vaccinated. hard be, I’m fully vaccinated others get chance I’ll wear mask we’ve given need shot. we’re expected keep masks distancing we’ll everyone protection keep hospital... don’t know say changes needed easily let lawmakers politicians make decisions.

Almost every infectious disease expert admitted expect virus isn’t going away, forever circulate population albeit mildly. **still** pushing elimination endgame headlines 11 months pandemic..? 1000%. also might talking ass, I’m fairly certain 102 degree fevers point lives. memory/pain fresh, we’re going say it’s worst we’ve ever felt event may worse point. making great case yourself.. year hard us. sure neglect mental health. Fresh air sunshine really helps lot. No, aren't. Elected politician follow proposals without considering side effects. elected politicians writing article, enforcing measures decided on. 2 haircuts past year lockdowns ...

that seems like benefit risk. country didn’t claim know origin location, proceed raze site could investigated. r/AngryUpvote  Aside arm soreness, felt bit tired it, like hangover got really bad night's sleep.

Symptoms started 4-5 hours getting vaccinated, lasted following day. fact commented women’s story asking “what’s point” shows apathetic really are. know “Irish” race. still white. makes think draconian measures would achieve aim? Ohh dramatic. existential threat. threat losing like 5% profits. families choose meet children willingly, family chooses meet willingly, gas station could make contactless payment compulsory, choosed willingly. Nobody forced anything scenario. Well, tried explain thought that, super defensive AZ. 

This football tournament, actually talking ending pandemic here.  George Carlin went experimental school homework grades. turned greatest comedian time. 

So necessity, think know works, we've never really tried another way. Man “muh freedoms” insult went window *months* ago. 

You know why? people past point able put life hold sake small % population.

So yeah, it’s actually complaining put house arrest. even right - article suggests ... *after public vaccinated?*

How far willing take this? Honestly. willing go another 3 years saves 80 year olds? I’m sure hell not. sick lockdown, movement end March 1st. Oh hilarious even two paragraphs picked highlight top \_directly\_ contradict other:

""A laboratory study suggests South African variant coronavirus may reduce antibody protection Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine two-thirds, **it clear shot effective mutation**, companies said Wednesday.""

then dozen words statement:

""The study found vaccine still able neutralize virus **there yet evidence trials people variant reduces vaccine protection**, companies said.""

Completely bonkers terrible writing here. Yeah, that’s sensible. Time tell, suppose. People aren’t receptive solemn news here, evinced downvotes.  Errr... variants? able reopen schools pay decades come. Vaccinating teachers investment future. Nearly every single state spike holidays extended downward decline. really sure getting information from. exactly, partly terrible article

They found antibody response two thirds lower SA variant, response still much greater ONE dose vaccine wild type, know around 50+%. thats theyre fairly confident. 

The amount antibodies generated response wild type much, much greater needed neutralize virus. Even two thirds reduction antibody levels still high enough neutralize  Thank God. wondering got many upvotes. season changed though? isn’t natural waves we’ve seen since start? say lockdowns inherently better economy. 


If anything type ""lockdowns"" worse economy. Go d00m elsewhere. essential workers service you? No. going (for arguments sake let’s say it’s pandemic unreasonably high mortality rate: 100%), places risk others. It’s you. example it’s yourself, friends, friends families, family, guy gas station fills car, family, person delivers meal, family, nurse physician care get sick, families, etc etc etc. It’s narrow minded assume decisions like effect yourself... Lol hell nah. currently COVID joined research study regarding it. argument? believe play part community, care think? worth, Nvidia AMD want build new production facilities US. Correct I’m wrong haven’t tested yet.

The test I’ve seen genetic modification spike protein, tested antibodies lab...

Not fully mutated virus, vivo. wouldn’t daring enough that. Something tells pissed gorilla strong enough kill lol I'm also going add ""Fuuuuuuck"" though? exponential decline combo of: idiots don’t think it’s real getting it, vaccine less people contracting compared last 6 weeks year? Please excuse giving damn made plaything 1% “the economy”. bunch Reddit buying GameStop proved “economy” scam. Please also forgive wanting government bail corporations tune trillions, cut taxes rich, send billions nations sudden screams “the deficit” comes time help American people. surprised see amount opposition R/Ontario given generally pro lockdown whole time. game reference Florida jokes aside, seem may underestimated seasonality. Cases getting much better. Nearing half million dead America guy still thinks big deal 

It big deal scary also ending. Jesus terrible title. wrong! Ummmmm....shh😌 Wouldn’t mean believe vax produces 66% less antibodies SA variant OG covid, they’ve found it’s still 33% effective (reduce disease severity)? It’s confusing one form expressing “less antibodies” still “neutralizes virus.” Here's best simplest answer, ADA MONEY. state federal government give schools money kid arrives campus. 

The school obligation making sure kids line turn paperwork state.

At one time attendance ATTENDANCE, PERTICAPATION, HOMEWORK GET MONEY. state made pretty hard teachers. 

If kid computer working hours part problem. Since COVID vaccines aren’t really approved, approved emergency use, can’t mandate like normal vaccines. I’m convinced poster teenager troll none info schools remotely true. lol  That's usually methodology. Review process reproducing numbers. indeed given, qualified scientists incapable determining methods sound. Bald Asshole also DNR people special needs, nice... thought were... official source brain dead news outlets dont know report scientific findings.

Basically, vaccine produces greater anitbody response SA variant one dose wild type. know one dose wild type around 50+ % effective. words still works, better one dose wild type well two doses wild type. seem bit dense. know CDC allows 42 days doses either mRNA vaccines right? actually responded argument.  .....really? chaotic situation... well wins.

Every day dirtier, colder, hungrier, poorer, sicker, watching watching energ futures go up. ( seen price crude go up, thats one)

panic streets make killing So, issue new stricter guidelines labs December ‘19? time suppressing reporting outbreak? know comments downvoted. great news lot encouraged about.

For example-I get Covid. I’ve read long Covid. causes anxiety. Anxiety gives heart palpitations brain fog. don’t go dr cause live America cost life savings. self diagnose long Covid repeat cycle anxiety.

I’m sure long Covid real. think non zero percent cases anxiety based. want kids back school must vaccinate staff(teachers, bus drivers, cafe workers, paraprofessionals). Remember US 7-day rolling case average dropped 100k? whole five days ago, going drop 80k today. Exponential decay, man.  bet they'll happy get vaccine. Seems like everyone hates Oxford AZ reddit now.. time being, active tests complete, unknown vaccinated prevents positive person spreading covid-19. vaccinated person may protected symptoms, may still carrier, spreading covid-19 Canada, parts world.

Because NYT ""AVG. PER 100,000 IN LAST 7 DAYS"" US 24 dropping really fast.

In SF, 15. said, send back. affect UK guys want do. 

AZ prevent people 65s hospitalised. That's good enough you, let risk out. teachers refuse go back classroom they're vaccinated, earth get priority? Absolutely ridiculous. Vaccine availability teachers tied actually going back teach, otherwise what's point. want vaccine like essential workers, actually work like essential workers Yep, read another story report made sound like great news.

Honestly people going believe stories support wanted believe first place. wonder paychecks lost last year among well paid medical professionals. Something zero absolutely nothing. much incentive change things, it? bought stock company you? have, that's point. favor providing help work whose income heavily damaged COVID (though already TON help provided unemployed beyond stimulus). high horse, pointing economy failing, unemployment emergency level, ""fucking prick"" suggesting everyone needs $1,400.

Even mild social democratic reforms met swift decisive backlash them, spend vast sums ensure policies never enacted, ceaselessly work tear are. reforms would change lavish lifestyle conceivable way, know this, fight anyway. Humans everywhere need public spaces social contact. It’s specifically American trait. EMA, likely bad faith, refused accept russian application updated documents old version online portal dedicated that. that, never told Russians this, kept waiting response, press went happening. absolutely limits far Europe go annoy Russia. drowning vaccines moment. not. OP stated, would hanging vaccinated people. risk there? drive infections vaccinated people still social distancing group?

As well, research pointing fact vaccines stop transmission well. i.e. part, get vaccinated. Sticking restrictions personal choice, think you’re getting vaccinated you’re gonna live life normally evidence pointing vaccinated people don’t get disease high rates, don’t spread high rates. Good see media outlets finally rational. hope hysteria continues die vaccinations increase, get back normal within months. I'm guessing make ton sense yet since (1) FDA approved yet - EAU still, also (2) there's enough supply yet anyways.

There really practical reason compel people take yet given even enough doses give people *want* take it. Democrats always back lose lose situations regarding politics. can't say vaccinations requirement ANYONE. Even though benefits everyone say that. make look like they're forcing vaccines, make right go ape shit shoot another school. they'll say shit like CDC says suggested guideline, requirement suggestion. 

The money claim need smokescreen like every policy suggested they'll look into. They'll say, afford right can't even afford this? afford need afford that? Suddenly nothing done constant juggle maybe laters rather taking action. bad. Sorry boss Choosing put ""mah freedoms"" lives family neighbours.

That’s pretty decent actually. [Time start masking toddlers, Lmao it’s amazing news outlet interpret results. one says don’t know it’s effective SA vibe disaster. 

Meanwhile CNN TV right praising saying gave great news effectiveness lower it’s still able plenty effective enough SA variant. 

Everyone talking outside ends. wonder people get confused vulnerable vaccinated Pfizer Moderna. good, despite Brits gave suggested, nobody wants die. 

The others getting AZ think largely turn pointless exercise, maybe even dangerous. People may feel safe live normal lives again, they're still risk new variants. 

You call hate let's get emotional. want quick future proof solution. personally think that, ideally, AZ play small part best. everything goes according plan, cases, hospitalizations deaths continue fall vaccinations ramp up.  approval rating going go quite bit things go back normal. 

All Cali done well compared states... 33rd country deaths per capita.. know. what’s frustrating didn’t happen like stronger, efficient plan sooner.

Meanwhile can’t get 81 yr old mother heart issues vax appointment work grocery store go workers test positive daily shot sight. re-read it, case skipped it, see anything supposedly good economy. Let's wait 21Q1 economic data tge USA vs UK. see lockdown would ""better economy"". Brett kavanaughs accusations turned joke too. Full shit.

See works? ""The study found vaccine still able neutralize virus yet evidence trials people variant reduces vaccine protection, companies said."" do, scientist. know review process. 

The study maybe rejected mostly methodology. review process fundamentally change data is. able scientist able analyse data make preservations wait certain elements confirmed.

The data alluded AZ indicative enough much I'd like see full paper, immediate outstanding issues. I'm sorry able objectively yourself.  lot context left title. can’t blame case. evidence yet whether safe pregnant women receive mRNA vaccine. seemed like reasonable request give time. Whilst UK obviously handled pandemic badly terms lockdown etc give full credit research vaccine programme. wrong. little nuanced. CDC continues endorse quarantine 14 days recognizes quarantine shorter 14 days balances reduced burden small possibility spreading virus. CDC continue evaluate new information update recommendations needed

However, shortened guidance 10 days would get people comply it, whereas made burdensome, people would blow off.

If need work see doctor, trying hang lulz, would still full 14.  lot jobs desperately need them. special exemptions putting rest us front line jobs back. work dental hygienist job definitely listen, obey, time, told. still basic principles many modern day professions occupations unique manufacturing jobs.

I’m like, sniffle? stay home, tummy ache, stay home, etc. answer you’re looking coverup. Good question. ""Then open people comorbidities all. ""

So solution easy someone comorbidity get vaccinated someone 65+ let get vaccinated all? mean... could wait pharmacies open 65+ logic want go with. Surely mean that.

You also said, ""Or tighten comorbidities""

Yes, valid point failing realize much slows everything. We're trying get many vulnerable people vaccinated fast possible. hiccups, obvious many specific levels requirements slows overall process. need working generalities, minute specifics get done (mostly) fair timely fashion. obviously places unequal, part they're trying get vulnerable vaccinated fastest accessible way possible.

"" mention comorbidities way bigger risk factor age. ""

Yes, some. general, age much bigger risk factor.

Just clear, I'm disagreeing say terms accessibility etc, I'm saying general guidelines made large populations diverse groups people. find middle ground, sadly middle ground almost always leaves outlier groups without best situation. I've always advocating months schools continue Summer way safer go break winter widespread vaccines. Meh. Ive downvoted hell before. dont mind it. Could hid behind HIPAA said none business  understand, shutdowns always protecting ICU capacities.  main purpose 2nd dose ensure long term protection? research yet proving UK's plan good one since waiting 12 weeks doses. purpose defending authoritarians. simply critique statement regime like must anti-intellectual. false statement. Vaccinate us go back. 

It's simple, really. though? caught virus going cdc guidelines, first thought ""how soon go see exact people?""  Herd immunity mean 100% immunity, means enough immunity R&lt;1. currently R&lt;1.

AIDIN VAZIRI FEBRUARY 17, 2021

California’s coronavirus numbers continue show signs improvement.

The percentage coronavirus tests come back positive — closely watched indicator reopening economy — dropped 3.5%. That’s 11% month ago.

Hospitalizations coronavirus patients also dropped 38% 14 days, rate infection state fallen 0.65 — meaning infected person infects fewer one person.

“We different place hard work,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday visited vaccination clinic packinghouse Coachella (Riverside County), area that’s home many farmworkers.

Earlier week, Newsom indicated “substantial” number counties likely enter red tier California’s four-tiered reopening system. red tier — allows indoor dining 25% capacity indoor spaces movie theaters, museums gyms open limits — would improvement purple tier counties, including Bay Area, in.

But even vaccinations ramp across state, California delivering average 193,000 shots day past week, Newsom said demand far exceeds supply.

In total, state delivered 1.4 million vaccine doses past week. California expects 1.3 million vaccine doses federal government next week.

“That’s good, that’s important progress,” Newsom said. “But clearly, basis administering, that’s enough.”

He cautioned mass vaccination sites opened across state past week, locations Oakland Coliseum Alameda County Dodger Stadium Los Angeles, cannot operate capacity.

“We throttling back many sites constraints supply,” said Newsom, adding current pace doses administered, Californians wait June July vaccinated.

MyTurn, state’s notification system scheduling COVID-19 vaccinations piloted Los Angeles San Diego counties, open residents week, Newsom said. People register myturn.ca.gov calling California COVID-19 hotline 1-833-422-4255.

The state also hoping vaccine distribution contract Blue Shield, administer 3 million doses week, helps meet targets.

In meantime, mobile community clinics continue pop across state.

A drive-through, mass vaccination site opened Wednesday Alameda County Fairgrounds Pleasanton. Run county, Stanford Valley Care Sutter Health, offers shots health care workers people 65 over.

“It gives sigh relief,” said Carl Sauceda, 79, Hayward, got Wednesday morning.

Salonia Williams, 70, Hayward, said hurry get vaccinated, checked online saw appointments open, “I thought, wait? feel good. I’m ready dance.”

During visit Coachella, Newsom said reached spending deal state lawmakers small business grants, stimulus checks individuals housing farmworkers infected COVID-19.

It includes additional $24 million allocation Housing Harvest, program puts farm food processing workers hotels contract virus place isolate.

“It’s candidly underutilized, recognize that,” Newsom said farmworker housing program. “And purpose new appropriation maximize effectiveness.”

Newsom said lawmakers would release joint statement details spending items later Wednesday. include money grants $5,000 $25,000 small businesses, nonprofits cultural centers.

The deal also cover Newsom’s proposed stimulus plan give $600 one-time payment low-income Californians.

... or, point? I'm sure sarcastic serious... Yeah, true, many businesses allowing employees wear masks simply sake appearances, Publix phrased ""so scare customers."" 

I think likely OP (parent comment) referring to.  Someone tell California. They’re moving next month vaccinate anyone disabilities risk related heath problems, list medical conditions oddly specific high blood pressure, type 1 diabetes, obesity 30-40 bmi doesn’t make cut. wrong. Sounds like lockdowns ruining one covid story. wear wig help defend corona? ThEyRe fUn advocating exactly, then? 

The virus always going around, even widespread vaccination, much less threat. scientists expect become another seasonal respiratory virus comparable flu cold. 

Keeping cases low level forever would require restrictions forever. Yeah, big problem Brazil. worst part people vaccinated right elderly people 80. much fucking scumbag need something like this?

Now people going company someone film vaccine given. lot health workers also showing syringe show vaccine given.

The worst part know yet what's really going on. vaccines sold illegally afterwards? Bolsonaro supporters nutjobs believe vaccine sinful alter DNA throwing trash afterwards? know. Thank kind words. feel work done high standard time, someone needs go hairdressers work time mind? Luckily us everything cloud based, queries email, landlines divert mobiles. work anywhere.

Reward good, support workers. want surrounded happy people. cultivate that?

In past ""looked after"" piss-poor middle management types, enough autonomy let staff go little early work done, mind medical appointments (how anyone supposed get outside work time?). worst managers ones went strictly rule book. see manage way wet paper bag. people skills thought rule book sacrosanct.

They badly trained, incapable trained, compassion understanding.

Make people happy, make happy. Simples.

Plus, tried recruit lately? hard work! wants could nicer staff leave? It’s pretty well known sub whole “there plan” narrative pushed Biden false (even Fauci admitted this) trump admin OWS provided solid framework us vaccinations point  Toronto’s Chief Medical Officer: “Despite vaccines, huge declines case counts locally worldwide matter prevalent new variants are, fact flu season peaks early January, I’ve never worried future virus variants. let non-essential retail open 25% capacity, face third wave overwhelm health care system plunge us 3-4 month lockdown spring summer”. 

Ottawa: able keep indoor dining, gyms, bars open year without problems. 

I feel like ever time people we’re going tell De Villa (Toronto) screw off, it’s now. actually said allowed small retail stores bring 2-3 people now, we’d take away patio season later. woman insane power overconfident abilities expert. respect her. possibly look words going worldwide right think lockdown option? Well end day comes 100 people don’t show 100 extra shots. don’t vaccinate within hours go bad unusable. local vaccine site closes 4. moms friends showed 3:50 asked extras day said some. called family went got vaccinated. can’t hurt go ask. Hmm, familiar reference ... clue in? ""less sight"" way Russia less sight go Fairbanks Nome. mean, yeah, technically correct, nowhere remotely close. Yeah, well...I WANT DOUBLE DIVORCE!

Ha, smoked... got healthy 3 years place line back. state offer smoking card either. would take months get unhealthy number up. cheer up. 3% implied stated reference military members is, guessed it, wrong. percentages include 26% hospitalized probably contains obesity also apply military. Listen know mean well it’s like talking potato you. things settle I'd really like see Dr. Fauci get TV show PBS like Bill Nye. country could really benefit learning science. Guess lucky then. dad grandad's kept hair long time.

Maybe purging somehow done injection. I'm surprised 1/3. more. I've experienced trying move city suburb happened twice. found place, $1,750 rent. Two days later, someone bids us $2,000 28 months. Found another, applied, got told accepted, signed realtor's papers it, next day get told decided rent family instead. end March move.

Got told realtor buying house suburbs stupid crazy people taking 401Ks pay house. saw house Zillow price history like $190k early 2020. $305k. Like, get here. Ready rent $1,500 place bad year, save even more, laugh everyone's housing value year. panic buying. country know stay calm.

I've seeing red stock market past 3 days.  Well guess time tell, great example sub already. Compare 2020, last year, current year, 2021, people grown tired lockdowns even masks (especially vaccination), last year certainly popular opinion, many people pro-lockdown time, pessimism dominant feeling back then, unlike pessimistic comments actually downvoted, beautiful sight behold.

I think right - I'm fine this, long they're honest transparent it, use event vehicle propaganda. bad help anyone, even allies.

I mean, lot people like Trump, pretty transparent. issued executive order, publicly, preventing exports vaccines. I'm way comfortable Biden simply mention courage say something line : ""we can't part endeavor allies yet, come eventually"".

He remains silent. hide, like Johnson want admit slapped ban AstraZeneca exports, using moment say: ""look great brexit is, we're winning vaccine race"". Instead admitting can't let AstraZeneca export vaccines government poor job managing pandemic, way found control situation.

Worst, criticized EU controlling exports, criticized delays EU signing contracts - same! absolutely disgusting vaccination turned propaganda vehicles, think mid long term bad outcomes...

In fact, starting show - UK USA denounced findings China investigation... rest world? Remained pretty much silent.

The question is: EU next time? sad, probably, yes.  agree would completely unacceptable...

if epidemiologist article actually said.

He said nothing keeping restrictions indefinitely. far aware absolutely one said vaccines made UK exclusively UK market. True sure popular sentiment sub, good common sense. countries getting free vaccinations thrown countries vaccine finished administering populations Believe averaging 1.6M last week, though weather issues probably pulled back sense kicking field goal? like situation set journalist asks thinks win says ""Maybe"". best solution would vaccinate spread (middle aged people) highest risk developing mutations (severely immunocompromised people) every country move groups across globe. never done since people view entire humanity one big family. truly believe that, might well restrictions told elderly stay home. everyone else lived life normal. 

I mean would better option I’m sure you’d agree mean, makes sense. even live, we’ve barely vaccinated 3 percent population it’s gone considerably last month. 400 cases day province wide 140 dropping. Coronavirus cases rise!
Experts : OMG why? happening. 
Coronavirus cases dropped half!
Experts : OMG why? happening.

Who's claiming this? I'm pretty sure directing wrong person.

You want fight nationalist brits internet - it; take elsewhere. pointing send vaccine back want it. problem? marshals exempt either way? confirm, 5 years good times daddy bounced country, ruining mom's credit. I've seen statements, ol pops owes million bucks. Oh, hey, know answer one.

It’s childcare murderously expensive, economic system isn’t set help parents (particularly, struggling parents) much all, school functions state-sponsored daycare addition education, allows parents barely eke living combining incomes partners. So, close school indefinitely, one parent forced switch full-time childcare, financial consequences ruinous. you’re single parent situation? Congratulations, staring homelessness face. Well, rollout mess world. New York’s mess right line states, United States significantly better West general.

But people continue get sick die downside curve, knowing make weeks months get vaccinated, don’t think they’ll comforted deathbed state line relative pace vaccination. downvotes predictable. lot money riding extending lockdowns long possible, people speaking truth - - attacked shills. significant factor might take number down. trial solely healthcare workers (a group that's 20× overrepresented covid cases). General public might much higher efficacy due much much lower exposure levels. U.S. personnel complained subjected anal swab tests coronavirus Chinese authorities

""*another* outbreak US embassy? sorry guys, know rules. bend over"" almost like different information different circumstances different stage pandemic. I've teaching high school 22 years. could tell many stories kids coming school obviously ill. Sneezing, hacking, unable stay awake well. 

We video temperature scanners everyone must walk past get in, covid. I'm leaving indefinitely keep students staff show sick. people also undetected hospitals? nearly March, ma'am. Amen! Proving what? NJ Maybe people start taking virus serious. sure spending lot time fighting vaccine caring wellbeing though. feel love. Thanks buddy. Mom Dad miss work sick. Selfishness? US one damaged countries COVID. Thanks sharing. got first Moderna shot today. anyone reading along, woman man says ""she emotions showing clearly fake, believe her. Believe women- except one.  even though eligible soesn't mean even get it. dad school bus driver NY still can't get appointment get first dose. Making vaccine mandatory point plain dumb. good luck getting US government agree let anywhere NEAR place lmao $2000 day 1 becomes $1400 *someday*

Classic dem Agreed. People get caught fact 1 dose still achieve 90%+ effectiveness, take consideration fact 2nd dose really longevity effectiveness. 
 
There guarantee 2nd dose 12 weeks 1st still give long term protection virus. really want give everyone 3rd even 4th dose botched timing 1st two doses? parents really strange feel someone anti-lockdown since, essentially, two weeks made sense. damage incredible - must end news coming telling us going go much longer yet despite vulnerable vaccinated therefore protected... Expect see concerns definitive end actually defined. ""Indefinite"" essentially ""infinite"" comes public policy government restrictions. article even mention another benefit elimination strategy: minimizing chances evolving escape mutations. stay-open-at-any-cost brigade visits every comment section every post sub force usual. 

It's depressing seem learned anything even half million deaths. Thanks trying u/Cinnamonstixz. I've seen kids dropped off, picked couple hours later. happens frequently!!! sad cause everyone risk, Teachers, Custodians, Aids, Kitchen staff. affects everyone one school. Everyone safe careful. Keep wearing masks right way, nose!!!! Christine Blasey Ford posited shitty, inconsistent story. long layers onion unravel. herself. Hence, suffered consequences fizzled obscurity. 


Do agree statement? don't, show true colors, considering everything surrounding case EXPONENTIALLY LESS evidence towards true, Tara Reade. 


Me Too, unless Blue. Cry it. check r/GotTheVaccine look videos people talking experiences YouTube. might well wrong, think EU bringing export control f$king reason.

It brought up, AstraZeneca told EU could deliver expected. strangely enough kept delivering UK. main plant located UK; indirect threat used little reminder UK hinders exports, would EU. never directed Canada. EU want act national like countries do. Let's get vulnerable vaccinated first. never hear much Silent Generation. nice. said Friday’s meeting Group Seven major industrialised nations – United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada Italy – “can create momentum mobilise necessary financial resources”. US secretary state, Antony Blinken, told council Biden administration “will work partners across globe expand manufacturing distribution capacity increase access, including marginalised populations”. Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, whose country president Community Latin American Caribbean States, called speeding COVAX stopping “undue hoarding” “monopolisation vaccines.” Schools LA County got green light open. believe businesses opening soon too. 

Light end tunnel hope. 

And China, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand--basically entire region world. pathetic poor country like Malaysia somehow cannot. Masks least invasive mitigation measure, they're uninvasive absolute sense. Handwashing staying home sick (or would paid, seems political that).

There already states masks required relatively low mask usage.

Yay...America! science pretty clear: strict lockdowns, mask mandates &amp; travel limitations work.

If government pursue making options economically &amp; practically viable, ""following science"" This!! acquire immune system coming contact germs. vital survival. 

I'm advocating pandemic... over, extremely unhealthy generation children sanitized immunity... keep current protocols. you’re already bald Pandemic took away me. I'll take job. I’m surprised myself. thought wouldn’t see numbers like May Interesting. pain point can’t move, huh? You’re first person I’ve ever heard report effects. might want contact FDA findings. Okay think next school year look like? actually believe we’re going ramp vaccinations September we’re already vaccinating two million day extremely well?

You gave response response didn’t really answer question. Top UN peacekeeping force providers India, Pakistan Bangladesh. must shitty job. entire world faking numbers make Biden look good? weird reality dwell That's good point undercounted deaths. could well likely Florida.

There's question CA paid heavy economic, educational, mental health toll extreme measures, feels like grown crippling point. point I'd like see son get education, one. set foot school almost year, gets half-time classes, teachers assign homework ask accountability. agree Robert M. Wachter. Get many people first dose possible.

Don't let perfect enemy good. need end thing fast possible Isn’t man boobs highly unlikely though? schools start catering sick children whats next? Employers? want disingenuous don’t reply others definition opinion? measured? could call system? anyone looked this? went toHS 12 years? Companies manufacture vaccines, countries Irony never said wrong right, asked reference newer article recent studies strain. Didn’t think freak much about. beds, staff resources correspond too. can't bed without resources trained professionals staff it. weird.... news morning, showed North Carolina cases deaths Georgia projected numbers... middle/upper class old people live alone? ones live multigenerational households grocery store workers? Uh yes. Covid causes lung long term organ damage. 

You literally saying can't problem problem would much problem lmao. Guess what, covid big fucking problem! friggin pandemic idiot. suspect story. least Uganda, visit gorilla family, group. max 10 ina group. visit gorilla family one hour max. trained socially distanced whisper quiet family. know, there. gorilla comes near you, stay still, motionless. Head down. state shows hospital stats flu COVID, flu still super low ER visits couple orders magnitude lower right pandemic started flu still common. Since seems get worse season. think many schools plan worst hope best. 

It's easier add people subtract them.

It's hard project Septembers numbers based today's vaccinations. 

There's lot reason hopeful though This! thought federal funding-schools get federal $$ higher attendance. sure. it’s bc higher attendance correlated higher achievement. Obviously must work everyone despite many claim doesn’t Australia producing AZ vaccine ...  many teachers kids died covid? Asymptomatic low transmission. Cdc says return... ""party science"" goes window. Party campaign promises fitting.... 

Meanwhile grocery workers 75 older dying. country protected special groups lobbyists. poor middle waged attendents cashiers along seniors got sacraficed. get started states expecting 75 older sign online.... still house phones dial up.

Teachers sacrificed, heros, essential. milking getting paid.   They’ve tired long point they’ve things extended much disillusioned . Even feel way sometimes. can’t blame them, honest lot sub still sucks. isnt news? would probably drive people following safety rules better.

On another note, ladies Texas Florida probably wont see many good looking dudes more. Honest thoughts... chances next school year starting masks, person classes, less/no social distancing? I’ll sophomore college next year I’d really like normal experience freshmen year ruined. campus chance vaccinated then. School starts late August. think rich going pay things made here? talking long term organ damage due swelling blood coagulation, citing length time directly infected disease, diseases long term effects.

But know, I'm literate. It’s European nationalism mixed ignorance. 

They answer BioNTech didn’t partner local pharmaceutical company. 

The answer course, none capabilities. Europe still quite far behind US biotechnology pharmaceuticals. 

No Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine.

But 70 year old bald guy likely severe covid 70 year old hair.  bald 30 year old likely severe covid 30 year old hair.

Age far biggest factor.  one risk factor.  saying baldness another risk factor, like weight diabetes status. makes sense though doesn’t it? outliers going people extremely small percentage population. I’m saying best fair way, something widespread much danger society whole covid is, yes, outliers groups small percentage population wise. 

This isn’t even large issue grand scheme things. They’re still extremely prioritized vaccine getting vaccinated 80% nation, there’s reason act like they’re disregarded left die something new technology always developed small R&amp;D companies, would work Pharmagiants mass manufacture. It’s even surprising giants got stuck old stuff upstarts pushed hard get new tech market. 

I always wondered Roche would never invested Genentech. people i’ve asked feeling “bit sick”. People dizzy point can’t stand, vomiting, passing out, pain point can’t move. lot people describe worst they’ve felt life 12-36 hours.

Yes, elicits terror me. Wot Ive isolated 200 days free. good deal. People really know quarantining means, going places near food limited number friends stop by, free range hotel. isolation. women get ""male pattern baldness""? 🤷🏻‍♂️
The least could protect herself, continuity government later prove easily corruptible process is.

This drop Ron’s goons failed Fox last night. Covid never going ""go away"". going become endemic, like colds flu. point vaccines build enough immunity population death / hospitalization rate becomes low becomes manageable without restrictions. Source NY nursing home deaths lower majority states? 

NY number 2 overall deaths per capita would interesting.

Edit: add, source independent NYS government issue hand potential manipulation data. Thanks honesty.  


And, get vaccine given chance, still part good, right? bought house beginning pandemic. wild hoops jumping complaining. Already house pretty much picked *just* pandemic, lease apartment already quickly approaching, new tenants already lined months ahead time, really choice point keep pushing forward pray lose job. scary hell. Covid one many things...*many* things... added /s? would amazed many people actually believe this. really jumping extremes mate. even without COVID 22 guarantee good life coming top, lol

You sound angry things work expected depressed. survive wearing mask visiting NYC. Neither things big deal make mind think are. Isolation sucks it. Sometimes things go sideways. Or, Forest Gump put it: shit happens.

Change expectations going serious stress/anger induced problems even COVID goes away. Yep present 🖐️ Same. Dislike. trend jan 20.

Makes wonder news calling terrible botched objective reality, fine better every nation. Really, really gets ol' noggin joggin. different virus made act like actual virus, among host things make headline scary data mediocre. Depressed? Nah. 

Furstrated? Tired? Pissed off? Hell yeah. 

ITs taking long. CZ getting worse worse. British strain hit fast, today ICUs basically full. country wide system covid ICU transportation failed. place left. 

Fuck 17 days add 330 far Pretty sad think UK help EU countries completing rollout UK , completely expect first mark new variety vaccine. EU old stock 👍 Okay - took thinking makes sense. 

- Put syringe vial. 
- Collect sterile air vaccine syringe
 - Design syringe normally purge 100% vaccine collected, left needle tip
 - replacing volume tiny bit STERILE vial air, something fill void would normally vaccine.
 - fully empty needle giving adequate dose thus getting additional doses vial. Boom gottem! Damn harsh downvote! Reality different ideal, reality people going acetaminophen load continually work shot. That’s looking at, downvote rando internet He's troll, getting annoying day. year 2021 articles titled this? predict another world ending event mass human ignorance. empathy universal trait unfortunately /r/2meirl4meirl 

It's jam. anonymous academic say reviewed data. likely RFA interviewed short question get ""third party opinion"". People seem forget also still need supplies capacity every injectable medicine across world well. Making 7.5B-15B doses short order small task, nine supplies planned last year, amd changes like takes years building new capacity normally meet Spending year nothing consuming media good time spent. always sea lawyer insists get the: anthrax, chicken pox, smallpox booster, etc. 
They always reports 'mispronounced-side effects causes  affect anyway.
When faced kiss-every-ring sight evals negatively affected, quietly get line find next thing outraged Comparisons take account one variable ignore confounding variables notoriously reliable comment shy scholar implies latter. sentence quoted may poorly worded translated.  Due things then? teachers. school employees. said ""lockdowns work people still gather inside anyways""

So ACTUALLY saying know ""lockdowns"" work correctly first place. 

Then went say long quarantining correctly, 'fuck it' - we'll head superspreader state.""

Or misinterpret reply.? Heading Bahamas &amp; two days Miami next month! agreeing - can't AstraZeneca, private company, manage inventory? say UK government allow export vaccines?

They liars? truuuue overall sentiment sub ""i couldnt give less fuck third world long countrymen get vaccine"" Yeah, US's lockdowns different think simple matter worse vs. better. tended emphasize different things. I'd also like see mixed vaccinations tested. would significantly stretch mRNA doses. 

I'd volunteer one dose AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax prime, boost Moderna Pfizer. see happened August. article mentions US UK already made deals time. individual EU contries. dates posted above. SA variant would agreed. must allow SA variant spread need doses sufficient neutralizing antibody levels. Giving two half doses induce much better antibody response single full dose. grandmother 99 dementia lives quebec idea she’s getting shot I’ll probably get mine next month live work US. criticize whatever want - quebec feds year prepare. ask government stop complacent “buddy” I'm wondering part (most) due selfishness others. refusal wear masks dismissal people dying. empathy gene seems missing 40% America. 

I depression ask increase meds 6 months ago. hot take paying product bribing someone give product? mean that’s technically correct also really really incorrect Immediately start one person, one vax plan today. got both. don’t get choice. School closures show politics anything. Teacher’s unions counterproductive hinder real progress education. No, *problem* spread vaccine around vaccinate 5% global population, virus time space evolve even new variants.

The issue enough vaccine yet, people vaccinated. think mortality 10x higher since 10% population infected already many countries.

In US I've seen estimates 30%, Israel probably 15-20%. Right, nursing home deaths New York also much lower majority states.

Why exaggerating one overdramatic exaggerating not? almost there's kind of... ulterior motive bias happening can't quite put finger it. I’m good do. I’m highly qualified teacher reward school. school system session since August. started virtual, moved hybrid schedule, we’re full option Virtual Learning Academy. I’m we’re now. students needed school parents needed too. Eh, could way worst - brexit propaganda bad contract EU, UK ""best effort"" clause... yeah... thing left miserable export ban. obvious beginning actions taken China way top compared official statistics. exactly. wait people get infected ""naturally"", trials took many months could done matter weeks. explain two things comparable? get confused self deprecating jokes, suppose feel depressed make jokes hear others make jokes makes question whether sincere. China's rapidly aging population, academic wished remain anonymous told RFA increase number elderly collecting subsidies, much less dramatic decrease. 

I hear saying, quote, shows academic reviewed it, took mean 150K decrease. 150K people removed replaced people. Yes it’s absolutely unheard media overhype things slightly comes corona virus. Jesus. 

I brought radio interview, heard official bbc radio station, chances someone else well confirm everything said. immunity takes good 6-12 months diminish. Expect become less rare. Vaccine make difference country spread around thinly, come really hasnt. simply continued exact trend. taking away access vaccine county current location clearly preferential like base definition threat.

not sure made clearer.

maybe fundamentals. vaccine saves lives yes?
making difficult access making difficult people protect lives.

definition threat:
a statement intention inflict pain, injury, damage, hostile action someone retribution something done done. story says 1 3 could develop symptoms last longer “standard” two weeks.
That’s nowhere near “80%.” Everyone, feed troll fucked vaccine orders would state spare doses developing countries. honest experts decades experience worried neither worked schools like this. crowded 3 generations living living space. easy find spacing normal school year 35ish students classroom never mind pandemic year.  Yeah, it’s true relationship lot it. kind give weird antisemitic-sounding vibe it’s one things. It’s really bad thing. I'm sure ""my body, choice"" applies apply certain situations.

I'm anti vaxxer. believe one right control someone's body. Ever.   really. pretty easily isolate mutations countries. people mostly idle someone learned explain sky falling [re: basically says vaccines escape neutralization sampling fit vaccinated population shortly vaccinations. expect best immune responses. do. immune response appears worthless SA variant. say Covid doesn’t real world consequences absent government intervention. businesses allowed reopen state, many shut back accord staff got infected literally didn’t manpower operate. Even businesses try operate like normal, doesn’t mean customers want come back yet. 

And elephant room, we’re like month past hospitals county past capacity. That’s dangerous people need care don’t even Covid. purely subjective thought: China trolled world lockdowns. 

China fucked virus lab; want admit incompetency; lockdown show world “serious” were. put pedestal media. saw somewhere China financial leverage Italy forced shut down, can’t remember source claim (it may Time article), won’t entertain much. 

Then, China showed world lockdowns “defeated” COVID photos parties jazz. media jumped pro lockdown board lockdown madness spread fast covid did. 

Such massive lockdowns never occurred history, especially free world. Shutting society know locking people holes, threatening legal repercussions never made pandemic playbook prior. Ensuring life goes normal main goal pre-2020.

So yea, authoritarian government’s makeshift strategy sudden became moral thing do.

We learned morality China... insane? Europe's vaccination efforts barely underway. Cuomo covered nursing home death statistics. random insult.  got vaccinated yesterday informational signs volunteers/providers folks coming public. 

Based read, system running vaccines administering them, seems that:

- Untouched vials otherwise require cold storage 24 hour shelf life
- Vaccine syringe 1 hour life span
- Syringes filled they're brought giving vaccines. 
- Syringes auto-spring removed skin, needle longer used. 

So overall, think way they're prevents contamination. also NEVER anything needle someone throw out. 2 lying far #1 deaths per capita. Belgium, Slovenia, UK, Czechia, Italy, Portugal, Bosnia higher. Europe similar deaths per capita US, despite much lockdowns. send another county county, removing counties access he's show preferential treatment gets setup imagine sending vaccines village everyone starving 200 years. Oh, really?

*Covid-19: First batch Pfizer coronavirus vaccine arrives New Zealand*

Guess, vaccines manufactured? someone explain something numbers me. theory prevents 93 percent spread virus lower percentage 93 odd percent mortality. Wouldn’t two compounded theory. Like people vaccinated greatly reduces possibility transmission wouldn’t compound reduced probability mortality. wrong thinking Yeah, unless I’m missing something, would far, far beneficial everyone get first shots ASAP. Maybe get vulnerable second dose lasting immunity everyone else getting first shots, pandemic ends much faster. sick leave vacation lumped together, like fiancée's company. Result (pre covid) could physically walk, going day. I've suicidal since 90s. 

Lockdown live life. real reason Napoleonic Wars people Europe needed way keep kids busy winter. US copied 1837. think Wednesday, RFA published government figures released Hubei Civil Affairs Department showing 150,000 names vanished list pension recipients first three months 2020 

It obviously means former. development? Sanofi alone make 120+ million doses delivered summer. BionNTech alone, new plants, expect 750 million doses made end 2021.

It's delay 2 months, maybe 3 months.

Going forward, even new strains extremely fast - according BioNTech development new vaccine 6 weeks, wait approval roll out.

The biggest perceived problem low temperatures (-70ºC), figured December apparently quite doable hubs hold vaccines distributed daily administration.

It's right move, way expensive (2x), EU free AZ arguably, UK export bans. countries suffering resource scarcity, comes vaccine. US exempt it. Even distribute J&amp;J vaccines abroad, millions, actually solve anything.

Countries need buy make deal UNICEF. else, risk increasing corruption poorer, less developed countries Nah, anti-mask apologist. 

That goes every stage thing, including CDC telling us need masks. information readily available one google search away SARS-like coronavirus first week February. haven’t said word lockdown measures quarantine. saying barely kills according hard data.  3 3. 2 lying. data old people ""crappy"" immune systems. results even better young people. mean he’s wrong necessarily, Canadian snowbirds definitely flying Florida get ahead line covid shot compared I've gotten Moderna doses. Tomorrow full 15 days second dose I'll invincible. don’t think it’s fair require vaccine isn’t even FDA approved still emergency use. studies really done pregnant women getting vaccine either wanted baby, can’t blame second guessing it. Israel still lockdown? keep wondering numbers fantastic one's allowed go there's another method tracking get. understand, I'm troll! federal government paying shots. long US resident, shouldn’t matter. radical leftists act exactly like Trumpets faced sources like bros? incorrect. 

This issue court hundreds times. Employers right fire employee refusing vaccinations deem mandatory work there. 

Further: person refuses vaccines, Airlines refuse allow board plane, Schools refuse allow children attend classes, person even barred public transit systems. 

All already tested courts. surprise GOPs want schools open ASAP? beginning pandemic, they're people wanted economy reopen ASAP well, saying ""seniors mind dying sake economy.""

I guess also mind teachers kids dying sake economy. Yeah heard machines pre-pandemic, even understanding rare treatment-of-last-resort option serious diseases. exist absolutely minuscule number, nowhere near enough make dent pandemic-level death tolls. sit nothing do.

I would give two shits knowing he’s jail.

But right empty pockets head full state secrets. Barely even kills? Americans died Covid combat World War 2, pandemic raging year. correct people would survive covid fine, mass influx people requiring medical attention put huge strain hospital infrastructure. Everything routine broken bones cancer care impacted severely Covid. still best interest Americans lockdown. Even personally would shrug virus, rate transmission creates compounding problem community. protecting sick feable curbing infections. willing make sacrifices needed protect fellow Americans. sucks, I'm anxious, economy poorly, responsible spreading virus kill people community. yet, probably one next hours.

But see summary above. Troll wife died 1993, assume so. Although, died 1995 knows Hopefully means viral activity another summer quiescent human activity Ok! Lol I’m college student continuously surrounded 50,000 adults (both young old). None us “over it”. good news article isn’t lockdowns, per se, there’s scant evidence folks long covid remain infectious extended period time. *Why USA letting citizens die protect people countries?* That's everyone normally going die year died last year. great grandfather single? definitely happen, 4 months sounds like cakewalk past year. mind sharing link? think people would find helpful. difficult discern reputable product \- appears Moldex masks available $1.25 each. check shipping fee.

*Maybe* — huge ""maybe — ""Mask Shut Up"" article *The Atlantic*? reach point hospitalizations/deaths consistently low, vaccinations widely available, general population uptake high sufficient time everyone get second doses + waiting period applicable, done masks, period.

That's engaging. That's enough doses make significant dent ultra-vulnerable populations small countries. 

As long production continues bottleneck, there's excuse anyone sit vaccines. too. Since least anxiety/depression comes interacting people stress jobs, neither really issue, thought would safe time test finally getting antidepressants. lasted month realizing that, no, stupid pills really necessary keep wanting constantly.  No. make complicated, break it. ""prove"" exposure? Who's going responsible verifying that? many cheat system?

It's really simple. Age = risk. Open age, go right list, verify IDs point injection. Start 80 up. 75 up. 70 up. 

Don't overcomplicate this.  mean completely normal might fall/christmas. on/off switch though. Same, social group gets vaccinated expect see regularly. stat necessarily apply you. delta lockdowns started Maybe has? can’t see it. Maybe next year granted freedoms benevolent leaders. Buddy, US lead comes number vaccines administered daily. And, america enough vaccines meet demands. problem is, said, first world nations buying many doses vaccines, effectively cutting developing nation able inoculate population year. Covid global concer, such, tackled global scale. Also, lol, much worlds sole super power, guess america interested outside world comes toppling democratically elected governements.. This. Arden said plans keep NZ isolated rest 2021 likely. New Zealand fine clearly afford stay within bubble vaccines need re-open, quite egalitarian let countries suffering take available vaccines. Exactly! 

And people personally know “they going keep us locked forever” group TERRIBLE adhering even basic directives.  ""mask folks"" always makes cringe well. inherent point, either won't, nobody tells people wear seat belt etc. Phase 2 dose dosing immune response. 

They undoubtedly short cycled many combinations order get market. made mask wearing wasn’t enforceable, exactly thing even though it’s problematic. UK got worse contract.

If case EU would got exclusivity clause UK clearly Covax contributions UK (640 millions) tiny comparison. Also EU gave additional 500 millions Covax top already doing.

No, EU increased funding **to** [500 million 500 million UK contributes Covax, EU already started initiative fair distribution vaccines raised 15.9 billion EUR it

That project vaccines, also tests treatments. also cooperation since US left made UK largest state Unless there's dramatic change existing trends vaccinations declining hospitalizations/deaths, feel pretty good mask-burning summer. Vaccine could something it, largely, cases also lowest September October weren’t major holidays. Thanksgiving Christmas break caused long January huge cases. So, prolong years style vaccine? know long term polio vaccine either. Kansas flu something well we'd probably today.

Vaccines can't pushed they're dangerous. like flu shot people may bad reactions it. People wearing masks profile pic rubs even wronger. efficacy one dose supposed around 92% even still 70% lower end confidence interval (this infection risk..they seen deaths severe cases person shot 1 2 response kicks recommended 6 weeks citing study data 2nd dose also found many instances lengthen even strengthen overall protection 2 dose vaccines Meanwhile Pfizer one barely works 🙄 crazy people different opinions thing. see Finland getting punished, despite getting amount doses paid for. see vaccines able go 10-20% vaccinate world quicker seems like great thing. even fucking question mean, yes masks worn regularly mandated law. 


Because human socialization important people really wants live society takes away human pleasure pleasure leads small fraction people's deaths. 

Why allow alcohol, soda, cigarettes otherwise? logical fallacy?

You established viewpoint it’s unethical hire children therefore shouldn’t - that’s fair. asked follow-up question turn direct result suggestion: “okay, so, where/how hire enough people military?”

That’s strawman argument, that’s logical follow-up question. Hey someone 31 still applying internships, tell aren’t old! Sure, big companies like Nike require undergrad internship, plenty ones don’t require it. got first internship Yelp 26, another year art studio. agree case trapped home Government says (lockdown) consequence anxiety depression. That’s kind surge get behind. location clinic irrelevant register shot.

Placing vaccine close proximity population nothing proximity nothing reserving actual dose. people need register competing everyone ability search online, limited access computers, internet, technologically savvy help. tier irrelevant, get exacerbated go tiers.

They get left behind many levels, benefit putting vaccine sites neighborhood largely offset little way registration process see people area gets shot.

Yankee Stadium example done required presenting utility bill prove identity residence get vaccine site. 

The situation essentially populations neighborhood limited ability travel, limited ability and/or access navigate internet, simultaneously competing people abundant amounts both. 

Yet theorize vaccinations lag, without examining shortcomings distribution; worse dismissing ""bullshit"".

It would productive adapt administration systems place address REAL needs communities knowing resource limitations. 

Pretending issues exist marginalizing nothing. Looking data vacuum less. ""The US Europe failed contain virus, therefore vaccinate less send doses countries""

Do see logic stupid yet? anything arguing better reason keep doses vaccinate faster. clearly can't contain virus methods, right?

Or 1st world lives matter all? yes, agree essential workers (including retail employees) prioritized.

Then going take everybody months longer millions cut line.

Stop making complicated. Vaccinate age range. Oldest first. That's science tells us, that's need do. point prevent 24-year-old healthy teacher getting sniffles. point reduce deaths. Using age, prioritize getting vaccine risk - including teachers, essential workers, etc.  UK right along...shocked...* violently dabs* Man, god bless relative get prep grading done one hour. age teach?

I teach high school, even normal year usually hour prep grading communication *per class* - adapting everything hybrid year made things whack. teachers state five classes standard load, lot folks take stipend position help make ends meet (childcare particularly expensive here). Add faculty meetings, obligatory professional development, parent-teacher meetings, hours end getting fair amount closer.

One challenges teaching easy job stopped giving s*** students. care students' learning, invest infinite amounts time improving lessons, adding accommodations learning plans, giving feedback assignments. one things lead early career burnout. Sure. every country work culture 30s taking vacations whenever feel like. case, 20s freedom years waste another them. Well shit, lost sense smell November 9 still can't taste food.

I decent job savings. first time life feel like travel, make new friends, party.

The 20s end all. Merkel's biggest mistake listen Macron. Macron one constantly lying AstraZeneca vaccines data back up. yesterday's NY times article, learned company buys bulk pass savings. companies http://shop.projectn95.org/ literally disregarded experts. 

The experts agree three criteria need met order schools reopen safely. 1) widespread mask usage. 2) 6 foot social distancing. 3). Proper ventilation. 

Point 2 possible schools open normal instruction. 32 kids cannot 6 feet apart classroom. want listen experts not? parents options CHOOSE continue remote learning, least point 2 possible. Point 3 literally impossible older buildings unless completely retrofitted.

I thought fOlLoWeD ScIeNcE? Bring everybody level, aye? 8 different combinations Oxford BioNtech Vaccines Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled December employers require employees get vaccine (except religious disability reasons).  Teachers higher position rate general saying ""you can't prove caught school"", correct *because rates community transmission high contact tracing work*. think much ask community transmission get back levels contact tracing could work, sake everyone, teachers. least 9-12th grades; k8 kids probably transmit well. Awesome, thank much, cost aside, factors didn’t think of. quote study supporting statements ? Right? Lightweights mean would too. Lucky I’m American tho Na he's correct, seem mad. Life go on. Life dangerous none us make alive. Coronavirus even deadly, fear. Good thing it’s really Fauci Biden claiming vaccinations significantly delayed. Still track Mayish, 7 month delay? 

After family social circle vaccinated going back normal. 

If business wants wear mask, i'm fine avoiding indoor gatherings domestic travel. lives must filled constant humiliation feelings powerlessness Whenever read this, wonder cause vaccine less amount needed full protection. 

Could happen? Good move, EU true 1 dose 80-90% effective, maybe 1 fine highest risk people done. give people option less controversy, plenty likely fine getting 1. 

Another thing changed dose amount given Moderna vaccine. quite bit greater dose amount Pfizer clinical study higher amount, can't assume lower dose closer Pfizer amount effective. Hopefully studying know shortly we'll able possibly triple amount people given vaccine supply. That's basically Google told me! I'm going rural Mexico next week flight home, I'll figure ASAP. mandated masks federal buildings going without one would make look like massive hypocrite. Masks false sense security given people encourage people go spend money economy doesn’t collapse. I’m sure N95s work 99% masks see public really don’t think much. counselor recently ask folks stop referring people her, schedule gotten packed. Lots people realizing need mental health support right now. TWO Depends many masks wearing tbh know why, use ""mask up"" rubs wrong way.  believe instances pfizer delayed 6weeks. reason single dose high efficacy would lose enough immune potency short period time. still preventing deaths hospitalizations people make point, Indians pull stupid shit like renaming ""covishield"" passing Indian. factory, produce Oxford gives them, nothing nothing less. guess I’m little trigger happy responding it’s important people know like early polio vaccines could technically cause polio. one can’t actually give sickness, although make feel rough body runs around making emergency antibodies. problem can't many nurses sick leave time, vaccine especially? They're still making amount liquid given timespan means vaccines administered globally period time. Yes r/politics cesspool anyway, I'm surprised either. Anyways i'll upvote regain lost karma link preprint ? I've seen english translation it

The data negative control analyses interesting. suggests covid cases first 6 days (before vaccine kicked in) almost 15x higher vaccine group receive vaccine all. 

What could explanation? I’m thankful I’ve already anxiety meds regularly see therapist years now. don’t think would able handle pre-getting help. guy exists, willing put name says something. know question he's asked what's context.  think making 2 dose vaccine first place? must reason, still valid?

Simp century husband's burner. SII (India) already party Oxford-AZ long indication investments paying out.

And even then, India still manufacturing lot offering UN already supplied many countries. obvious beginning. vaccinations, many things, there's law diminishing returns - get maximum communal immunity, better vaccinate 2X people one dose X people two doses. body.

But speak 6 weeks pregnancy one instance. controlled environment. followed team trained researchers. one baseline normal vaccine pregnancy.

I'm thankful baby ok one knows possible effects. pregnant longer vaccine available. flat reported spam. He’s posting thing every day break rules spam wonder means. Infections deaths still falling pretty rapidly UK. Sure, infection decrease slowing down, that's expected  Idk getting hate, lockdowns alone damaging people sure cause depression. Doesn’t mean we’re aware seriousness covid ""Younger adults, aged 35 under, likely experience psychological distress age 35.

Extending list include fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhea would detected 96% symptomatic cases

While might true, also unrealistic - I'd imagine like half population would least one (cough, fever, loss smell, fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhea) given time...

So makes sense focus first 3 better predictors covid-19 imo. Yup... Add fiance statistic. Whole family caught covid December. 3 6 got admitted. 2 got released.. lost father. horrible thing going through. I’m going laughing pub summer. COVID, lockdowns. think Gottlieb one grounded, consistent, logical, reasonable expert voices this.

Not directly related, despised almost everything Trump administration, selection Gottlieb first FDA commissioner one exceptions. never heard start, led agency well, post-govt activity throughout pandemic quite solid opinion. That’s exactly  president United States said time. stressed much seemed reasonable, know never end time genuinely believed would soon. hard be? put candles tables think we’re set, right? government may well incompetent, public ignore restrictions, think place blame government.

Not bashing country, I'm Spain exactly same. think people bare minimum fighting pandemic (i.e., following rules) much moral ground blame government. thing say countrymen. teachers unions across country already said vaccinating teachers enough get back classrooms. TL;DR - hospitalization rate first thing needs 'correct' society function normally.

Let's ballpark this.  (This amoral analysis, strictly based numbers. human life value protected.)

It mortality need go function normally. hospitalizations. hospital fills, every single excess person needs facility cannot access it, Covid illness/need, faces risk 'adverse outcomes.' metric control many people need hospital, arguably, long need it.

The United states peaked 130,000 people hospitalized Covid January. Presumably, also individuals need hospital either treatment avoiding treatment facility. 90% reduction hospitalization means peak infection hospitalization would 13,000 people. would allow (or rather, would result in) relaxation protocols. assume 'relaxation protocols (masking, social distancing)' would amount five fold increase peak hospitalization vaccinated/already infected populace, corresponding increase 0.6 yo 2.5 basic reproductive number (give take, admittedly back envelope analysis), would still max 65,000 people hospitalized (again, hypothetical world 80% people vaccinated, take precautions rate hospitals filling forced measures back place). still optimal, lower (from memory) normal times hospital beds pre pandemic 100,000, within 'bad flu season' planning (ok, probably little high side). 

This (maybe?) worst case scenario, since emerging research suggests vaccination result less shedding, ergo, lower maximum R0, basic reproductive number. let's pretend going happen, purposes analysis. hospitalization rate coming still becomes driving factor 'we open'. rather, point. 

Remember 'flatten curve'? goal mitigation strategies stop infection. goal reduce death ensuring every single time person needs hospital bed, one available. idea need focus stopping infections... noble goal, high level planning is, be, saving lives. means tackling hospitalization first. 

This analysis account issue 'Long Covid'. might determined long term, need prevent every infection due possibility many people developing symptoms long period time. case, mitigation strategies might need incorporate planning. ok fine. someone expected skip meal every day donate money would've went towards starving african child eaten days? That's essentially proposing here, we're technically less need, donate doses *we dire need to* countries need more. false dichotomy, question giving something need another country needs well, giving something *want* i.e money, another country needs it. ""better questions,"" encapsulate full view issue, say disposable income we're giving up, money would go towards rent paying electric bill. year road we're trying make profit leftover vaccine doses, absolutely, donate them, detriment health population. Things improving people can't handle it. stay positive! really good beating depression, starting great new career college covid real challenge me. definitely someone excels offices slip easily home months time little connection people. next time massive crisis happens, going throw sense humanity bus? state read data. make assumption reported. That's basic principle reading news.

Btw anonymous source reliable. google source claim get ""anonymous academic"". People done even much better agents RFA. Still greater number available doses then. know argument cyclical end result generally available doses fulfill orders. Luckily I’m music-loving music-making parent wife constant talker least stimulate way. Here’s actual publication,  There’s difference wearing mask pregnant taking vaccine pregnant. think issue?  LOL, @ listening believing person promised 'over Easter'.

If friend could drop work house sick enough days, going overwhelmed got back something already learned new much point bringing home. week friends could drop stuff kinda screwed got dumped day came back fully healthy yet.

Surprisingly school whole lot willing work said ""sorry out. basement flooding"" saying sick doctor's slip. agree. one failures Trump administration explain better. Get test Yet reason everyone still loves him, house enjoying retirement instead misinforming public. countries can't pay vaccines countries holding them. zero sum game, many doses. Yes specifically talking Canada. concede misread earlier message leadership opposed culture. apologize for. start string fallacious correlations countries kind assume you’re getting at.  human nature greedy hold power wealth costs.. sad true. surprise consider social mammals dominance hierarchy. Humans exception. Psychopathy label. Maybe I'm sad, jaded person genuinely believe overwhelming majority humans would become greedy, empathy lacking people given chance. work till dead. America hurts me. Sound like pre party blew real one away! know interesting me. We're seeing evolution taking place breakneck speeds, yet...even witnessing evolution still deny it. 

Anyway pretty fascinating see virus keeps mutating. lockdown since day 1. seemed blunt destructive instrument. even though I'm 64, hated threw young people bus. months wore became increasingly angry, frustrated, frankly baffled people continued cheer restrictions crucify different perspectives. view human nature changed permanently. Biden saying expect normalcy December, really gonna take long? bought 10-pack genuine 3M N95s Ebay $50 couple months back. American teacher can't afford one-time investment $50? $5000, $500, literally $50. masks reused long time long rotate them. Someone severe multiple sclerosis solid organ transplant probably likely die HEALTHY 65+ year old. magically become much susceptible COVID minute hit 65. moving goalposts around dishonest.

Your original argument 'well people going fall cracks that's fine' ignoring fact average going harder disabled and/or sick person drive three hours someone 65 healthy. 65 year olds stop able drive either.

Not mention could allow \*both\* groups pharmacies everyone would opportunities rather prioritizing people solely due age.

Stick one argument. That's harsh true color state. state voted giant peach dementia (both cycles, god help us) cases declining pace country we're looking relax restrictions sooner rather later. People voting comment emotions 🤣. Umm daycare. Ppl always sent sick kids daycare. child brings home daycare infect rest household. It’s vicious cycle. hospitalized flu pregnant kid brought home daycare. bad couldn’t even drive hospital. 

Your anecdote cute, sometimes kids bring home illnesses deadly vulnerable family members. totally, it’s fact defended saying something effect “well who’s gonna stop killing die covid.” recognize they’re joking woulda much sincere validating like “yeah, it’s fucked man, think people like risk severe disease prioritized.” I’d never expect someone offered vaccine literally decline justice reasons. That's saying everyone. communities hit pretty hard; naysayers aside, can't access gap.

Without groups clear, society truly COVID free? Bodies pile corporations getting bail outs Could covid? Slightly flushed hot face headache. Lower appetite. I’ve sort high altitude place 1000-2000m, I’m sure it’s might covid!!! ideas? Furthermore, get benefits anyways. late. time vaccine train reaches full steam summer Europe getting 10s millions time versus building trickle US now. Oh agree, expected opinion. logistics vaccine rollout absolutely work progress. said, roll outs significantly efficient, supply would still major issue. isn’t enough production capacity supply whole world won’t awhile. Maybe. moderna graph starts show divergence around day 10-12 placebo vaccinated group, however 51% efficacy 95% CI range -54 +87 percent, best get hopes up. still thing many schools. Many still penalize students reducing grades first incidence. teachers also extremely unaccommodating sick students criminal schools even person right teachers unvaccinated.

This DISGUSTING.

A workforce already underpaid lack teacher availability is?

This country bunch fucking bullshit operate. Idiotic fucking decisions everywhere. deserve downvotes, American culture actively tries make workers feel like this. I’m normal ass dude (not first responder teacher) I’ve vaccinated. offered vaccine fucking teachers haven’t been? shit show job vaccines. I'm NY, enough supplies restaurant workers. Yes eligible supply. sound crazy maybe suddenly realized much money could make developing booster? Yes? 65+ year olds would denied others taking place? never fucking said okay people die. said make general guidelines since population big there’s diverse range people. Stop trying dehumanize anyone doesn’t agree exact viewpoint. People disabilities still offered vaccine earlier 80% country. Stop acting like move going lead hordes people disabilities dying around. absence science, you’re going make stuff up? 

Do think scientists hiding you? you’re smarter are? American thing. Sick days frowned upon, although tends kind unspoken rule experience. People outright say ""it's frowned upon take sick day"" pretty obvious it? Hear, hear! I've saying since March 2020, whatever. OK, they’ve established costs $5,000 break rules. Fines cost want people afford them. Comes culture better worse.

And article points detail, parts Canada pursued elimination strategy faired much better parts not. want call program didn’t live promises success, maybe agree disagree. screeching ""factually incorrect"" sky make anything say less true. I'm sorry covid ruined brain ability think rationally anymore. Good luck, hope feel better come fear cave day. put deadline social tolerance, though. ends people say ends. Long story short OP protected shit potentially exposed. Again, that's EEOC says. ""*Genetic* proof"" originally wrote, irrelevant specific case. fact is, employers allowed ask proof receipt vaccine. Firing employee lack proof receipt allowed long there's ADA exemption *that can't reasonably accommodated.* 

In words, business employees choice working home office, require working office vaccinated. someone unable due legitimate medical issues, accommodate allowing work home.

However, also determine working office (or restaurant) presents health risk employees customers, can't work they'd expose others. kind hard waitress work home, thus accommodation possible, termination would allowed. N95s Amazon fake. Also everyone afford luxury protection Quite opposite. libertarian stance.

People free make choices. Every one.

An authoritarian one would forcing get vaccine will. looking two totally different sides spectrum terms personal choice. think SF almost hit yellow tier one point. they'll change tier system point there's ""normal"" tier. Folks, seriously, “react headline” article - read whole thing it’s long. Every day contradiction woman? Let's forget masks supposed *temporary* inconvenience. Telling people they're going continue wearing them, even X happen reduce severity virus, would look good compliance. Imagine thinking going get teacher accidentally marked absent grade 1 can't prove there. need turn location history phone, people. think understand lot people denied access vaccine pharmacies die catch COVID. argument literally since many people fine. else supposed mean said small subset population? ""Back normal"" go maskless unless location enforces it? right now, two studies shows evidence transmission vaccination study needed 100% confirmation. Please, keep mask on. Seems pretty science-denying, considering evidence masks vs evidence vaccines :/ still allowed University? make point. Newsom becomes Democratic nominee, I'm planning write Bernie Sanders. want see another GOP president, can't vote Newsom.

Here Virginia, open since June, death rate significantly better California. think people choosing take precautions without relying restrictions determine behavior. changed anything since 2nd jab? going etc. That’s punching clock is. like/need money job anyway clock end day. Loving job loving money different things. There’s people make lot money hate job leave lower paying job something love people leave job love higher paying one don’t like. that’s got words said, think need go back 5th grade work reading comprehension. one said anything arguing kill people letting die lmfao. Get shit. worked place gave 50 bucks days sick, 25 one time sick.

So paid people get others sick, half department would taking sick time lady eyes 50 bucks came infected them.

America diseased long time. Give rest. Yeah they'll probably move hospitalizations-based tier system point end restrictions they're confident hospitals overwhelmed. COPD, immune system, certain types cancer...the kinds things literally getting cold could kill you. going make bigger COVID risk 65 alone. US claimed spanish flu originated spanish back 1918 first discovered US, kinda makes loses credibility comes accusing people virus origin. US claimed spanish flu originated spanish back 1918 first discovered US, kinda makes loses credibility comes accusing people virus origin. lost respect deliberatly witheld information regarding herd immunity stats. literally admitted lied public order get wants (specifically herd immunity threshold) personally consider pretty damn disrespectful argument killing people 'well many anyway' may want consider argument might good.  No, numbers incorrect. stated 51 percent 14 days, 92 percent 14 days  **[Automatic translation provided Google Translate. process developing vaccines went smoothly quickly following necessary steps ensure safe, effective vaccines. understand 2 months first dose administered, countries managed get meaningful percentage population vaccinated.  
 
In Canada rollout especially messy. Delays, cancelled shipments vaccine, sad, really.  
 
This disease brought world economy crashing halt. People suffering. Businesses closing never reopen. figured vaccine would become priority #1 governments world. thought production capacity would increased absolute maximum. Factories pumping vaccines fast possible. carefully planned logistics networks administer fast possible. ""Reasonable"" hardly driving force past year. saying. No, believe claims China started virus, like many lockdown skeptics do. numbers cited correct... cite numbers second half month alone.

I felt data point irrelevant since OP exposed first half month 51% (in hindsight, could left month-long 80% number).  Unfortunately actually. I'd hope judging handling everything seems otherwise.   Lol missed 75 days freshman year reallllly bad mold allergies never came close getting award. I’d get letters mailed home notifying parents couldn’t miss anymore days. classes trailers worst. literally always sick feels like every day article comes sayinf effective yhe next isnt. Id love know ans keep publishing stuff without conclusive proof one way other. believe it’s 1%. success fin? virus already Europe mid-November. stopping one. stealthy first. Doubtful, first certainly last. Snowball effect happen law passed avoiding litigation. Let's real here, insurance companies send millions dollars make sure happens avoid going business bonus. ever underestimate power money. Yeah don’t think that’ll thing average healthcare encounter. It’s one thing you’re bone marrow transplant patient, like, people functional enough immune systems concern, especially mass vaccination literally said one news channels woukd work ok. Indeed, meanwhile Chicago undercut elaborate tier phases introducing new program giving 2000 shots 15 neighborhoods anyone wants it. surprisingly, that's success demand management een failure. No, ridiculous award was. entire school career 1st 12th grades.  schools actually open teachers vaccinated, go it.

If teachers try stonewall though, bother. issue grew (near Chicago) lot public schools air conditioning. Kids productive 90+ degrees classroom. would occasionally couple days like June particularly warm, part, days watched movie fanned notebooks. remember one kid actually fainting one time.   Texas make bars normal again? don’t neighboring countries, low population per square mile, lots spread. 

It’s like you’re starting point western culture sucks trying find logical path it.  married Welcome real world, deniers. metrics site, makes 2021 worst year history like last year year year that. That's I'm wondering 

Male pattern baldness also correlated age, known COVID risk factor. Student attendance everything regards school funding. wife Dean Students Jr high school charge discipline. getting pushback district office suspending many kids school, even though fighting breaking rules. Nice! live northeast metro, kind Oakdale White Bear Lake. relative lives Maple Grove. Lmao always say guys many damn chain restaurants! 😂 Ya know - less truth behind saying ""priority.""

I never looked way. LoL. I'd substituted priority highest risk. Exactly. school system followed guidance still reopen even 1-5 students per class teachers chance vaccinated. profession case? doubt it’s journalist infecting people. Long Covid described anything longer 2 week active infection. Studies claim common site self reported vague symptoms like ‘low energy’ lasts additional weeks sign ‘long Covid’. year long time context. Alternatively, could focus vaccinating likely spread it. Elderly people nursing homes risk people bring Sorry, said ""don't trust government serving"". that's aimed party, dont believe trust either republicans Democrats. Even covid always irritated puts public risk PANDEMIC It’s hardy alarmist expect one’s waitress today reason lied getting vaccinated. Thanks link. agree. seems ridiculous pregnant person, minimal increased risk virus, stratified group solid organ transplant recipient, pregnant/obese/smoker people truly much higher risk, everyone relegates &lt;65 group go behind 65+ group.   source claim thousands deaths linked Sturgis rally? That's EEOC children losing year education critical time lives? Elderly teachers shouldn’t come back vaccinated need get kids back classrooms soon can. problem politicians every-day people thread, saying ""CDC says ok, teachers need get back school!"" actually read guidelines understand districts unable meet them. ...72 million prefered disinfectant.... fathom think it’s worse NYC residents, many don’t cars. parents live upstate drive 5 hours state site appointments, live upstate cars. Lots people city find appointments upstate, safe way get there.

I able book appointment upstate due comorbidities, everyone means that. would sick enough throw school stay missed anything teachers half time real dicks it. Favoritism highschool big thing teacher loved you, didn’t even need show class hated extra harsh unforgiving know.

I think --- schools 100.00000000% (e.g., every school America) open in-person classes next Labor Day, failed country. Again?! thought spurious correlation! It’s confirmed!?


Edit: oh. “old”. find interesting quick insult people online. personally feel consistently following basic principles professionalism throughout school years helped prepare set expectations college career. Middle high school highlights life less say set good foundation real world. 

To dental hygienist need associates practice clinically. usually takes three four years get degree pre-requisites nurse. teach go marketing work nursing home, get bachelors degree broaden opportunities get masters degree. might never want hygienist ever ended chair, would treat respect treat patients. Could related UV exposure. Correction.... overemphasis money. Schools districts made decsions based possibility losing funding students physically attend school. Compulsory student attendance unrelated teacher vaccination. employees (we’re talking employees, students) compulsory attendance jobs. 

And far student attendance compulsory, isn’t really true. kids moved home school rather risky, anti-scientific useless “hybrid” proposed. Well, take statistic, multiply 5 times, reduce time frame 1 year. COVID 15 times deadlier auto accident example, it’s also highly contagious, unlike auto accidents. 

So yes, getting car acceptable risk me. Exposing child COVID acceptable risk. 
That shouldn’t surprise since one 15 times deadlier other. sounds awesome!! I'm Maple Grove, I'm townhouse neighbors say always look forward ""display"" every year. I'm going go year. rough. Lucky kids! hope wonderful day. problem I'm seeing many places schools unwilling unable follow precautions, politicians saying teachers need get back classrooms people want get kids back school.

My wife teacher, district, limited staff building help high-needs kids already, months.  teachers able get vaccinated yet, school board keeps trying shove everyone back building.  don’t walk around worrying catching mumps... it’s effectively gone. trust country they're serving, blame that, serving. 300 pack n95s costco online, Niosh approved. No. mom works office full maskholes friends service industry. Nope. Alberta initial batch cases came Americans people travelled states. 

Travel also banned really. Know someone work gonna fly Florida month pleasure stopped parents... Canada orders additional 1000 doses. delivered Dec 2021 related note, coming say let kids experimented on, please save it. looking Canada wanting 9x vaccines need... I’m happy bar gotten low you. 1 4000 chance death age group. 

Probably worth £4500.

Everyone know shrugged off, literally never get ill. assume immune system beast. Thanks tip! use future paywalls. literally said male pattern baldness said women get it. true not? think Australians much different Americans? Perhaps are. Perhaps respect understand science greater numbers, I'm sure. leadership culture broadly. 

Even states US much much better others, e.g. Maine Vermont, also happen two oldest populations average. doubt form herd resistance, 25% Mexico antibodies november, country hit hardest December January, 25% USA maybe antibodies right now. kitty kitty kitty, double standard hen work together. 

Fed distributes supplies issues guidance, states administer forth. Can't distribute without accurate supply. 

45 accurately distribute, states reliably schedule appointments, ect. 46 reliably distributing, teachers getting prioritized allotted amount- state, 46. today found old spreadsheet like two three weeks ago deaths country, Sweden, back then, categorized age. could simple get current numbers age, minus those, see change age dead period. well, deaths decreased considerably ever since.

Sweden almost vaccinating people older 80, 70% deaths among group people.

Despite vaccinating like less 4% total population, already difference. proportion dead people group decreased 5%. Since deaths younger people increased, simply means less deaths.

All tiny amount vaccines used.

I keep spreadsheet see develops next weeks. Don’t glum 2021, already survive coup attempt! Americans prefer freedom giving near 100% survival rate virus. shame that. places without restrictions haven’t done worse many places restrictions, look Florida example haven’t really cared nothing catastrophic happened. people know hate restrictions would perfectly fine without literally make difference private sector. 

The government cannot mandate vaccine fully approved, private businesses can. Macron said AZ vaccine ""quasi-effective"" original strain virus. zero data support statement. remember start pandemic allowed purchase something gas station cause wearing mask. aren't, posting here. vast majority people apathetic point. need accept minority people feel affected this. See, that's absurd. I've plenty ailments - food poisoning, example - knew going on, need drag go sit doctor's waiting room.  Yup, good bad. I'd call pretty even trade point Rather, simultaneously overreacted reacted. national mask mandate back March 2020, sanitation highly emphasized, idk locked given half-assed was. likely masks mandated public spaces every winter simple tool prevent many horrible deaths. yes, allowed wear mask. Firstly: think suffer sort learning disability, keep repeating myself

Secondly: children. Legally cannot recruited 18. ROTC serves indoctrinate earlier that, that's entirely different story together.

Thirdly: saying 'this sucks' without offering alternative simply referred 'bitching' 'complaining', stop it, cause fucking annoying Sounds great. Glad they're this. Seems like logical question me. Russia offering 100 million doses Q2 can't seem provide enough vaccines population. vaccines come from?

They want end another AZ situation expect certain amount doses exist something *everyone* administering doses specialized / risky? Virtue signaling, projecting, etc, etc Due spacing concerns Walnut Hills High School, parents Cincinnati Federation Teachers called extension remote Monday night, Cincinnati Public Schools Board Education approved measure Board Member Mike Moroski keep Walnut Hills HS virtual ""until district elects accept three-feet social distance standard.""

From article, school staying virtual parents concerned overcrowding. Parents school board want social distancing classes.

And ones linked, says first round shots would hopefully complete past Saturday, second week vaccinating teachers staff, meaning teachers can't possibly fully vaccinated March 1st given 3 week gap doses, let alone full protection comes two weeks second dose. would anyone think teachers would happily crowd schools they're actually protected vaccine? mean, threatening withhold second dose clearly shows knows important!

If deal they'd go back vaccinated, DeWine considered March 1st hard deadline, maybe vaccinated teachers faster. that's understandably something control, opening date. meant is, may many people, all.

furthermore.. would people fine without restrictions? really? i'm pretty skeptical it, sorry. whatever want 👍 simple  Seriously? about.... doctors learn better combat virus. Many people volunteer things like this.

You’re also contagious lasting effects. 

I can’t believe explain adult. Pick book something. Good know thank USA regarding J&amp;J we're still waiting Feb 26th update right? vaccine 100% protection severe disease : missing sometihng here, Germany? common cold usually harmless. gonna popular comment be... don’t like direction life going, change it!! one power influence life yourself. easy part mindset reading comment. hard part keeping mindset makes difference. allowed wear mask pandemic over? Seeing flu numbers go made think maybe masks good idea. mask makes face less ugly. case EU would got exclusivity clause UK clearly want.

In case missed it... AZ gave delivered EU. EU got wanted! No, EU increased funding 500 million 500 million top. UK contributes more.

They EU gave 500 millions Covax programme UK 640 millions. 
But said, EU programme funded **billions** millions. It’s time us citizens push back insanity. one wearing mask come spring/summer. think correct sick leave, even people sick leave need interact world way, especially live alone. still need get groceries, need travel doctor's office, etc... That's ought wear masks contagious. Every day tell doubt I'll around 2-3 years. feel like much future graduated high school 98 got bachelor's 08 28 got internship started career. long production continues bottleneck, there's excuse anyone sit vaccines.

And yet, Western world absolutely give Israel pass this...no surprise No. got copy licensing agreement? know conditions UK attached it? I've seen uptake masks area since November, I'm guessing many cases December &amp; beginning January people took little seriously. addition I'm guessing many people take social distancing seriously contracted December/January natural immunity now.

On top schools remote since November, least area less spread there.

As far winter goes, holidays feel like there's much people really congregating much. No, he's saying keep spread low vaccines roll rampant mutation render obsolete, wasting billions dollars knows many lives, literal shot herd immunity.

we want like athletes celebrating win cross finish line fall face &amp; get passed competitors never stopped working. fact NY allowing 150 people wedding compared IL limit everything 50 making think NY becoming one lesser restricted states now.  Pretty lame statement especially considering labeled respiratory disease false. as? Please crawl back hole came post drivel. got mine literally verification even person said was. Seems bad, also I'm really sure adding red tape process right move. Irony I've dealt depression life I'm pretty good right mentally speaking. class disparity separate problem education system got highlighted pandemic, absolutely think government investing heavily trying improve last year problem open. Trying force reopening cases questionably safe right approach opinion really hides old problem away again; call day things maybe better problem stays continuing cause damage, next time there's another major disruption society running around circles complaining exact issues. ""We still wonder Russia offering theoretically millions millions doses sufficiently progressing vaccinating people,"" told reporters""

We still wonder Ursula feels position negatively commenting UK, Russia, China, whoever suitable deflect blatant incompetence vaccinating enough people.

I mean, people arse. voted woman president Europe?  Isn’t tho? don’t understand vaccine isn’t way point you’re making. vaccine least invasive way this. Everything else requires great sacrifice everyday life average person. Could point right direction track R number. Cant currently find source Macron said ""quasi-effective"" thing week news vaccine less effective SA variant. one adjusting . one know likes masks nothing look forward to. don’t think two options mutually exclusive. I’m hoping whole awful pandemic results positives, including sick leave, emphasis TAKING sick leave need to, wearing masks somewhere sick shouldn’t socially unaccepted past. don’t try enforce others shouldn’t issue.  Yeah, healthier life choices would definitely huge help, cutting poverty would best measure seemed like sarcastic sure, quite buts end it. 2 3 adults denial depression/anxiety due Covid 19. Everyone hit this. post-Covid normal means masks full capacity indoor sports, concerts etc. think six months.

I think masks last go, even things open back up. hear point, researcher think there’s lot said differences exist theory vs practice research. think there’s lot stake stick what’s rigorously tested vs theorized (especially vaccine supply likely distributed coming months). I'm good following recommendations medical experts. Stay home, socially distance, go parties, avoid others, etc.

I'm never invited parties anyway, I'm still taking full credit. Even really wanted right now, make federal mandate masks worn federal property?
 
Also think CDC recommended double masks he's going definitely become norm going work. Fortunately adequate sixk leave europe, problem here.

I definitely see mask usage good flu still want go grocery shopping example. Like people asian countries already did. mean personally would stay home hate, really needed go somewhere would nice people, use mask snot everywhere. I'd guess US end passing AZ along countries, Novovax definitely something nobody talking could real boost I've heard one person say ""JUST wear mask sick"" mask cure all. 

But sick still may need leave house. may need go doctor, drop kids school, pick medicine.

Even universal sick leave people still need leave homes. 

Masks tool, separating better always option. Definitely much higher 1/3 teens. I'm one freshmen 2nd semester College. horrible. Online classes absolutely useless unbearable. motivation school went door long ago, pretty much everyone else. finally able live dorms semester better, first semester home pit fucking despair. Can't see getting better time soon, I'm gonna finish semester best take gap year get job something. Anything better shit. honest think Catholic priests, nuns, bishops, cardinals reside Vatican especially concerned fertility. Highly unlikely. need whatsoever They’ve hit goals far. It’s impressive reason think miss. incredibly difficult believe would ""incompatibilities"" vaccines.

At worse booster give fever, fatique, etc. I'm trapped country fiancé trapped another. separated since November 2019 diagnosed pre-existing mental health issues. Pandemic helped. ""opinions"" things factual answer (which easily found google search) called misinformation bullshit. Anti-vaxxers deserve politeness, I'm afraid. Bullshitting vaccines costs lives. Lol! eat lots fruits vegetables. Thanks assumption tho ;) Funding issue. probably case enough vaccines. Anyways, international cooperation nothing charity. Bullshit. reason doctors giving people getting covid shot haven’t received second one. 

Read article. research sponsored Pfizer. Saying vaccine 100% effective anything dumb gets.

Even Pfizer vaccine reported 95% effective preventing hospitalizations, accordingly [Israeli based real world data.

Taking vaccine 59.5%~ 77% effective assuming 100% effective nonsense. think pfizer really cares that. missing almost protection SA variant mild mild covid leave scarred life. mean 3 3* think approved ahead JNJ vaccine, honest. Novavax platform ideal RNA viruses. really care masks care public places businesses open like bars, restaurants, gyms, parks, sport places, schools, etc. need get houses back activities make life worth living. article recent studies. Hahaha. Fucking baby shit. Count one. Well, complicated, especially given countries going lot slower comes vaccination. Every country circumstances, common pattern saw basically every major country (besides Australia NZ):

* People traveled/gathered holidays, probably lot huge worldwide spike December.
* lot governments around world, around time, introduced stricter restrictions response, either proactively reactively.
* (addendum: lot governments around time introduced strict measures response new variants known)
* maybe everyone followed rules T, there's still lot did.
* Additionally this, really lot major worldwide holidays January/February people would travel/gather back home families for.
* Cases drop.

---

To fair, though, think American vaccine effort, perfect, actually going pretty well, especially relative many OECD countries -- I'm optimistic side thinking overwhelming ICUs something happen much, much lesser degree part we're taking care vulnerable first. 40 million people already received first dose (many elderly), elderly population America around 54 million so. always pandemic itching breakout, viruses incompetent time. Ffs like handful arguments yall memorize repeat everywhere. care 1- vaccine protection 94% 100% still get sick without herd immunity, 2- everyone get vaccinated, people conditions young get vaccinated. Get educated try thinking others yourself. Oh, ok got it.

Thanks! sunken cost fallacy Cases started falling Jan 12th. ~4 days people would caught it, 14 days people would needed vaccinated get meaningful protection.

No, 0.5% population vaccinated going cause stark downturn.

We've watching downturn awhile last 2-3 weeks really hit solid numbers vaccinated people. traveled year. course I'm depressed. Life short pandemic already took year away. I'm sure offices empty, outside recreation significantly down.

Walmart might fun 2 hours every week, otherwise people curbed do. I'm positive voted him. Scum. EU giving away vaccines free charge poor countries, presume? Thanks link. wasn’t aware that. also thought couldn’t require therapy approved EUA. 51% confident work doubling numbers potential lives saved make worth trying can't believe incredibly common sense idea somehow followed.

There opinion piece Washington Post [Fairfax County open schools stop vaccinating comments author ""Republican operative"" ""hates teachers"".

I really understand it. going teach front kids get vaccinated. aren't, don't. People would say literally anything defend Europeans website. already Florida Surprised Johnson Johnson take long distribute following approval. even testing this? first dose little side effects second dose felt like complete shit 48 hours. clearly something taking place body second dose. highly doubt levels EU vaccine contracts demand vaccines made Europe. would come European factories started producing yet. Soon, Sputnik V also produced many countries outside Russia, including large commercial labs big capacity countries like Brazil India.

To date dozen countries supplied Sputnik V heard date single complain contracts respected, unlike every single big pharma lab Europe far. Depends county California. live Riverside county vaccinating teachers. mAsKs LiKe pAnTs. dIcK nOsE. Yup. That’s totally true. like SPED students back since august anything. Novavax could pretty great. X-factor approval. FDA approve vaccine Brittish SA phase 3 trials? not, low case rates mean could take trial long time complete. I’m sure getting info someone received second Pfizer dose aren’t 95% covered till 10 days second dose. means supply bottleneck starting 10 days. need administering 4M/day rates. think possible. 1.7M/day without basically pharmacy - natl assc pharmacies estimated alone could dole 3M/day.

If things go logistically well, 1 month may machine path getting mostly done memorial day.

Real game changer fda says OK 1 shot - everyone get one end april thing ends. Meanwhile tons coming may/June 2nds anyways. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vast majority kids health conditions make risk serious illness covid. vaccination, vast majority teachers strongly protected serious illness covid. Put together, kids, exception rare extenuating circumstances kid health problem puts risk, need 5 day in-person school. Almost kids extremely low risk serious illness covid, priority almost kids go back 5 day person school. Closing schools also shown significantly reduce community transmission little gain, lots lose, opening 5 day person school soon teachers vaccinated  feel you. HS switched hybrid felt like losing mentally. learning anything class stsy 3 homework days. 

Hybrid made lot bearable, though. I'm learning something class half time, get go somewhere outside house socal interactions outside discord Lol. obvious anyone medical scientific training. Partial immunizations lead mutations virus way worse overall population health. Yes. good data.

My point around sub issues AZ vaccine, especially comes SA varient.

There data vaccines perform severe disease hospitalisations SA variant, small study suggesting AZ great mild disease, must useless.

Nuts really. Russia exporting vaccines geopolitical objectives, like China. long Pfizer slow production issue. think we've proven administer far supply.  Username checks out. vaccines provide protection known variants. gets reported again.

There headlines variants ""cut antibody protection"" thing decreasing effectiveness vaccine. someone media misunderstanding vaccines antibodies work trying make story Makes think maniac’s five months ago, long fomite transmission debunked. 

Mind you, guy *obsessed* virus. care vaxed.
So take flight everyone vax non-vaxed person gets what's problem? - everyone else protected vax.
Anyway PHE said virus getting vax - bet huge turnout vax 40's age bracket. think ridiculously grating. say wear mask. get it. Even though explicitly say article, also doubts vaccine itself, rather lack dependable data verify Russian claims. is? Ms Ursula Van Der Leyen. Every week attack someone else. Seriously, really needs highlighted public health type messaging. always see arguments claiming ""the science"" supports schools, gyms, etc. (insert thing want open here) safe studies show responsible high percentage cases. time completely ignored stats come contact tracing data, said extremely faulty. lot likely misinformation spread people media oversight, like people saying ago ""no point closing anything public, 80% cases come private gatherings anyway"", including 20% cases actually used get number ones contact traced. US, 12% population one shot, around 80% vaccines administered January 10th (roughly cases started drop). seen cases drop \*faster\* since then, despite fact theoretically 5x many people vaccinated now. vaccines really driving decrease, expect see numbers go even faster now?  


 
Continuing A/C analogy, building freezing cold. A/C unit rated building eight times smaller ours. Moreover, AC turned *after* building already freezing cold. What's likely: 

\- AC making building cold 
\- really cold outside one turned heat least automod told us website censored. buy KN95's there, update whether fits not. Even masks aren’t mandatory- sped students exemptions Yep FYI: Transmission may also occur routes, including contaminated surfaces theoretically protected people already.

Does greater refer 25k, read comment responded to? sure voted him? know say assumptions..... Russia exports vaccines: bad
EU exports vaccines: ""international cooperation"" Umm, okay? I'm saying stores popular targets thieves going want see customers entire face. people demand strategy chance, lockdowns work next 6 months. problem many politicians stubborn refuse change also think varies lot age students. kindergarten classroom lot different high school. high school kids probably counted keep distance going ask help going bathroom. calling xenophobic racist betrays lack understanding either part. words want throw around assume moral high ground.

I ""one people"" TRYING give perspective. never said anyone ""too stupid"" anything. able navigate internet make someone stupid. Plenty dumb people internet I'll leave that.

What said vaccine centers irrelevant required register online compete everyone pool anyway them

I taught schools areas frequently would run hurdles regarding internet access. Many PC, Mac Book, smartphone, internet access, particularly senior citizens. 

Public transit limited. get pretty much anywhere public transit realistically get location take 3 hours one way. trip would take 20-30 minutes car.  

This defeats purpose putting sites neighborhoods thought increase access local population others register, make appointment worrying location, freely drive get shot.

Where vaccine located means little factor things. 

Person limited smaller number sites person B, access sites register reach sites Person register reach. pool people access vaccines locally citywide people realistically get vaccinated locally. supposed postulate Persons B vaccinated Persons A.

Doctors hit miss. Doctors said people accounts get vaccines. BEST may give number online portal, anyone access to. people back square one.

In practice proximity sites little way increasing actual access. inequities areas addressed rollout areas.

If want belive nothing anything, pointing reality hatemongering answer that. personal issue. manage outpatient individual therapy wait list mental health agency 250 people it. people waiting since July. keep hiring therapists enough. People struggling much right now. Also, one agencies area accepting new clients. accepting Medicare medicaid due wait commercial insurances. truly awful feel bad people call truly struggling can't anything help Essential workers essential profits. Vaccinating health care workers families makes good sense.

Vaccinating remote communities hospital beds limited makes good sense. Russians said want EU approval EU welcomed Russian vaccine; however, looking facts, appears Russia neither wants deliver vaccines Europe substantial amounts.

The Russians playing political vaccine games. Vaccinated teachers coming back in-person school going promote spread variants. vaccines strongly protective serious illness known variants. means teachers extremely unlikely killed teaching person vaccination. Kids always low risk serious illness begin with. Closing schools shown significantly reduce community transmission. Keeping kids school pretty bad variety groups variety reasons makes sense teach vaccination. 

This issue afford bide time wait indefinite point future ill-defined metrics. happen now— question kids go back school now, make go back school now. It’s urgent issue breaks heart see people cheering measures overall hurt kids public education system could raccoon dogs intermediate host original sars pandemic spilled humans civets. frustrating really heard anyone investigating Chinese fur farms, although would obvious thing (along checking old blood samples Wuhan apparently done yet...).  I'm paying customer. really hope rules changed anyone wants wear mask voluntarily able so. Especially they're sick. Fuck fauci make gay? think crazies get covid more, maybe it'll limit them! point is, sometimes sick days flexible paid time employees get (unless see week ahead future). that's case, far, far valuable waste minor illness long still work. Fair enough  Thank this. feel like I've fed disinformation.

Sorry, Ursula. suck less job thought did. probably want person zumba classes. Yeah, said latest episode Coronavirus-Update podcast, well worth listening understand German. Around minute 30, talks ""half-academic"" nature vaccine (i.e. fact university researchers played huge role creating it) respects contributed communication problems around vaccine, publish perish ethos means every working group incentives publish part AZ studies separately, bits starts. turn leads public confusion—because public constantly hearing something different vaccine—and leads mistrust. found extremely insightful! UK got supply chain setup earlier therefore getting production problems sorted earlier. UK never got initial promised doses instead kicking screaming government helped could. get whatever Vaccine offered you. immunity better immunity. pretend politicians without common sense. lot people country claim they're everything right claim taking virus seriously also lacking quite bit common sense. point stuff starts shipping still likely 3 weeks away. huge amount time maybe things little better? 10 million right bat would still huge one dose regimen.  No. Actually misread initially “contracted COVID”, “died COVID.” Ok seems like reasonable claim. ever countries? see disagreement saying. visit, silverback brushed past get flower. protocol place pretty good unlikely gorillas risk.

This article trying cash coronavirus. agree. everyone really worries vaccine efficacy SA variant, point story. Media people loved covid-19 want exploit much can. Fake news. still good enough protect you, states article. US ideal sending sick kids school nothing Asian ideal same.

The applies work. Men MPB higher risk heart attacks, makes sense. Sorry, people give damn lives around USA?

The US healthcare system leaves one third population stranded without medical insurance - private insurance, medicare.

Did anyone care?

Did anyone speak demand 100 million people get sorted government?

Please let's pretend suddenly started caring people. Username checks known really getting people bed action. also thing evolutionary pressure. That’s something *we* help influence type mutations start show up. vaccine represents dead end virus, hosts antibodies them, putting “pressure” virus change, else fail go extinct. scare you, governor NJ paused reopening extended State Emergency 12th time of...39 cases UK variant. 600k people live county 2 cases here. Sounds like total emergency me, starting think certain politicians ever want end. Yes, vaccinated people get infected transmit virus. effective shots 100% effective, they’re ~93%. 

What don’t know whether vaccinated people asymptomatic cases carry virus transmit it, without symptoms. It’s like scene Princess Bride. Yes. Where’s source claiming Drosten ever advising masks? negative new positive. Someone needs send Lori Lightfoot. year, would happy get infected covid it, meant lockdowns lifter sooner.

(Site note: already covid months ago, yes, wore masks law required, worked home, still got it... part.) Part problem separation time off. get sick time (they like regulate this) vacation/personal leave time. Rather giving time use needed. leave company usually pay vacation time sick time. treat sick time gift. They'll opposite whatever suggest. tell ""never punch balls"" fun. don’t know long term immunity single double rising strategies Yes. Real world data abound evidence. take 2 states within climate region w opposite levels restrictions place, seeing identical curve claim true.

The chart cited saying proves holiday spike poor understanding data front you. Every metric started increase around Sept/October (depending region) last year, well holiday travel etc. follow epidemiological curve, regardless interventions restrictions. peaked within 8-10 weeks subsequent declines. like seasonal respiratory threads clear comparisons Yes FDA approved schedule tested trial, anyone feeling Canada may do, given rollout really full effect yet still researchers speaking Canadian health institutions? mean, look like it’s going instead down. Due *response* covid 19. anybody worried actual virus? True Biontech Moderna.

*Covid-19 cases defined occurring participants least **two** following symptoms: fever (temperature ≥38°C), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory taste disorder, occurring least one respiratory sign symptom (including cough, shortness breath, clinical radiographic evidence pneumonia) l*

Sinovac Biontech said one symptom period Willy Wonka nonsense two symptoms one respiratory. Apples oranges.

You're saying think important trial looked high exposure group vs every trial better involved general population?  would suggest prioritizing people pay money highest-need people globally unethical. look closely efficacy numbers. lower numbers usually mild moderate illness. almost equally effective severe illness, hospitalization death people really worried about. Propaganda buy bullshit anymore Poor people typically dont option. problems stem rich rich poor poor Yep. I’ve considering obtaining medical marijuana card. work elementary school, yes still give perfect attendance awards. Although end year thing since May 2019 since school basically cancelled end last year.

I remember one year girl getting giant trophy missed single day K-5. Really award lucky health. Antivaxxer protected class Lol masks 2020. It’s vaccines I'd expect statisticians world read better epidemologist. Idiocracy iRl really ""reduce""? variant can't affect vaccine. things true technically. protect, reduced rate Ever Send Sick Kids School?

Because effective workplace protections allow parents/carers/guardians time care sick children.

It's schools, *everywhere*. Unless want seriously look way society organised, make large changes benefit 90% people, give up. believe best early indicator likely Israel UK variant Pfizer, no?  


Last read UK variant fairly common Israel SA California strains detected almost month ago - given much population vaccinated (and single vaccine), we're likely learn lot next months them.  It’s similar think. Mutations don’t *improve* virus become prevalent. quickly phase out. Mutations give virus advantage, mutations “catch on” spread.

What we’re seeing spike mutations becoming common less common. it’s developing multiple continents independently.

This means random mutations change spike protein represents evolutionary advantage. virus able spread more, antibodies *less* effective them. Chickenpox still routinely vaccinated UK, worry all. vague memories it, sucked, like vast majority children made couple small scars scratched hard. state legal requirement every employee much. Media like this. late. Anyone power vaccinated. think - I’m still going wear mask bc places require least people getting vaccinated, there’s probably end sight regulations tl;dr Bhutan awesome country find odd give number like 50% 24 day period includes 12 days shot effective. think people care long term outcome. rather saying ""0% day 1 90% day 25"" average it.

Laypeople naturally gravitate towards lowest number one vaccine 72% another 88% think one 16% better really case. really care long term protection adverse outcomes. IHOP went waiting table people next masks got left Orlando area. businesses went pretty good enforcing rules. state pretty much set ""guidelines"" ""mandates"". Ah, see...I can’t “just walk past” kids anymore person. Everyone ten feet apart desk shields. stay bubble front room. 1 3? Smart move! me. lined us hundreds mass vaccinated everything possible. choice matter, doubt anyone ever considered even trying question higher authorities.

Of course, also tear gassed us couple times basic training. also quite fun. Didn’t know America society culture make people feel anxious China Middle East human rights basically don’t exist almost exactly experience. go school board get let move first grade years ago due absences. letters pediatrician, allergist, pediatric immunologist, ENT saying chronic issues legitimately keep home school lot. know crucial development surrounded peers age, part grateful germ pit year pick every single thing goes around more. He's also severely allergic dust sets asthma home control exposure. We've one incident entire year he's school balm nerves. posts claiming 80% generally people mentally unwell. irrational fear Covid. Obviously 80% completely unrealistic number. point almost everyone knows many people Covid. I've never spoken anyone knows someone ""long Covid"", let alone 80%. know people said March last year, cure can't worse disease, thought hyperbolic nonsense.

Now thinking cure fact worse. Good thing I’m stocked Xans anxiety, psilocybin edibles depression. hospital change policy patient gets infected sues silly. Companies care employees bottom line costs change. Cue random internet stranger last week “we need get back one cares people sick, share drinks move on, one died” don’t understand it’s problematic offer 25k information Black man Oakland, need stay goddamned panels,” Tran wrote series tweets. “This moment need ask ourselves, end? accountability process, okay, highly doubt that. Lastly, looks lot like bounty Black person funded Asian American celebrities. major, major doubts.”

Not black man, black man committed horrible attack. 

That racist. 

No article actually provide reason police answer, vaguely claims racist think without refuting it. 2 3 adults depressed anxious due COVID-19 There’s thing called COVID crotch got higher that. get bumped list USA gives vaccine countries, probably impact vote....just saying...  already union hospital. pandemic shown little hospitals think us nursing professionals. locked allowed interact human beings. covid. said would happen social media networks started. Humans need human contact Depends context. I’m still gonna wear mine NJ it’s required people work people stores vaccinated community spread still fairly high. Definitely dramatically parts country. Still done want spread shit body go work line cook... fired?  shamed trading floor energy company worked called sick, one trader showed sick flu, spread half trade floor caused large number traders get sick stay home days. management quickly changed toon sickness would flat tell people even seemed like might getting sick go home better. Funny companies change tune impact profits mass flu outbreak trade floor did. lucky hit time weather making prices jump... happened prices static doubt management would given shit day. That's kid whose parents would put bus dead. send sick kid school sometimes kid might lying avoid going school.  so? Please elaborate. understand this, makes sense. Thanks. offered shit, get it. Well, what’s really cool aren’t even giving spike protein. They’re giving snippet generic code body produces spike protein. body reacts produced. give one example Google blocking website selling masks? think that's actually it. Basically US lockdown people still stressed sad.

Like issue I'm legally barred going bar friends, would irresponsible stressful thing do. Prioritization logistical mess, there's guarantee shot goes someone ""worthy"" anyone all, faster rollout better. Take shot. sell anti depressant pills. Good them. Bad you. stupid see fact. Every shot counts Well, businesses still thing, so......  Someone ban guy. either bot shrill selling fake masks online Hi Yeah... certainly control body... protect job. right free speech. miss work protesting week straight good possibility fired. Hi Looks like part Gohan really pushing Cell's KameHameHa, boys girls 💪💪 I've seeing TV briefings believe SA/Brazil variant going spread enough issue time booster shot developed.

This UK variant likely remain dominant strain quite time. also looks like whilst AZ definitely taken hit still protective hospitalisation death. endgame turn sniffles killer disease.

Again expert I've hearing. Take second covid shot. data much wider margin error may see efficacy low 68 percent. Secondly, even data showing good results much much smaller sample size data clinical trial data Israel shows two shot regiment highly highly effective. pace enough vaccine supply everyone summer eligible they’ve determined deserve early line. Take shot stop worrying small scale study large margins error. probably don’t know yet that’s trials run. Honestly, lockdowns restrictions make wish caught back April May recovered.

I would rather 3 weeks hell 11 months counting. It’s parents go work economy continue on.

/end thread don’t agree it’s you’re fucking ignorant way world really works. Maybe, people getting vaccinated, I’m guessing it’s likely might hit 600,000 read ""caribbean neanderthals""... think deservedly still envious guy burnt ass sitting barbecue winning lottery. Probably combination ""America dystopia"" ""Americans likely admit depression places."" live Japan guarantee asked like 1/15 actual amount mentally ill people would admit it. Despite that, excess suicides literally higher covid deaths. lot places Asia (where people live) lot less open mental health also lot less disruption virus. Go ahead get vaccine. don’t care. loved ones adverse side effects allergic reactions, you’re fucked. pharmaceutical companies zero liability. Put pipe smoke it. Bill Gates major share holder Pfizer BioNTech stock. He’s laughing way bank. argue philanthropist, donating billions dollars help world’s poor, let educate you. foundation owned family.

I’m sure it’s need civics class math class, promise numbers 51% needed win election, zero. parents wanting miss work. pandemic changed too. jobs virtual, still enough help lower income. better solution would companies allow sick days. (At least US) assumed reporters paid word.

Sometimes get news mainstream media outlets work subscriptions pay 10 grand+ for. incredible see one pay big dollars deliver information 1/10th words. anyone else getting sore throat frequently wearing surgical/N95/KN95s etc?? feel like never problem stuck cotton, revving protection throat hurts like every week. weather also pretty wacky going warm cold might contributing factor, soooo annoying.  ???

Canada actually almost vaccines. certainly sitting hundreds millions them. bought lot diversify manufacturers developers future vaccination unclear. Cold war v2.0 pita version Y'all fucking laughing us last year. also Canadians coming America get vaccine, Florida fucking insane that. don’t know it’s NY potential. ""no evidence"". good evidence, combined solid theoretical basis. think large part may concern education done via online. Education school system glorified day care. I'm sure teachers lobby groups think boards may may concerned losing jobs pay cuts. recall correctly, Brazil strain = South African strain. know that. Thanks! one saying here. Really it’s enforcing law. strategy keeping social distance focusing masks. ministry health always pushing keeping social distance fooled masks (not masks bad nothing). wear mask people less keen holding social distance.

Also, countries aren’t islands Shareholder read anything....100M promised June.

I hope Texas gets back normal. crazy see weather bad. Plus power situation terrible. dont know topic enough really literate it. 

Does mean 93% less chance spreading it? theyre 93% immune? You’ve posting essentially every day past week, get it, like masks. Indeed. someone field working R1 university try clean misinformation.

Wait what? massive news true. could already known this? person got right. No. Typical healthcare worker condescending attitude towards non-medical people. 

People don’t come Internet blatantly lie “want attention“. 

Allow elevate intellect second:

Just like bad reviews, get dissatisfied people ones motivation incentive go online tell others it. 

They’re mentally broken people pretending non-reality attention-sake. They’re simply people reason go online share experience abnormal upsetting.

Anyway, fucker could rot hell care. Important distinction!

""COVID-19 caused massive job losses"" -- no, government policy did. 

We option power virus (which agree with), beyond frustrated political leadership acting like hands tied, well people cheer so.

Being leader means taking responsibility. rare sight days, easier safer use rhetoric blame virus everything. already battle depression, anxiety, ADHD, ideation, anhedonia. I've cooped year. Remote teaching daughter hard. Depression even cover way feel. anxiety skyrocketed beginning too. However, I’m teacher forced in-person learning since September actually helped calm anxiety while. first, cried panicked upon news school would this, first couple months, started relaxing. started realizing following science rely comfort. HEPA air filters, keep windows cracked open building fresh air even it’s cold (my winter jacket become best friend), everyone wears mask, student shave desk sheilds desks 6ft apart, temp checks door, etc. guess eventually made realize there’s much done can’t spend every day riddled fear. literally making sick. Good. hell purchasing vaccines population? werent depressed COVID paying attention. Another case ""If effect me, matter"". I'm sorry hear little one. anyone thinks person lying child ill needs get life. hate kids sick, would lie put evil heads. So, closed borders forever? hardest Brexits... Me! anxious time I’ll get give mom I’m scared see friends I’m depressed lonely too. Plus lockdown unhealthy lifestyle habits helping anxiety slightest. like 20 panic attacks since pandemic started. It’s terrible. one 1 3, confirm.

I live alone touched person almost year. I'm extremely high risk wonder worth continuing much longer solitary confinement meant people done something wrong. crime born medical issues. Waiting vaccine seems like never going happen.

I feel sub-human like worth anything. I'd call depressed. Everyone forgets isolated year wears humanity. literally remember hug feels like anymore.  pathetic...

Coming you, compliment. clear here, one answering question sign correct.

It's question obviously [a leading [false better question would something along lines ""How much give benefit others?"" ""Can give examples actions take detrimental benefitial others?""

And since we're topic coronavirus, maybe phrasing something like ""Would willing give vaccinations family higher-need populations around world could receive doses?"" that's threat though. help there's group says ""coViD hoAx"" running around licking doorknobs public toilets. reasonable abatement trying stay sane gets called evil both. furthers feeling isolation COVID created. ideal mental health... would union rep get things covered.

Similarly think it’s unfair conditions world led certain countries hoarding worlds resources countries left nothing. Reddit loves act progressive fuck capitalism that, vaccine it’s oh well free market paid you’re lucky get scraps. Truly shameful attitude. vaccines approved US first second dose. Indeed. Quebec represents half deaths Canada. Care homes specifically represent half deaths Quebec. care homes absolutely brutalized Covid, especially first wave back March-April, also second wave. 2/2 household temporary (hopefully) alcoholics due COVID-19 masks vaccines. know Bill Gates wants people get third dose variants clear owns stock companies make vaccines, would help bottom line.

And two/three masks thing. I've worried companies make might want market go away anytime soon. Since people least mask two three, could see manufacturers want push idea needing wear sell more. 

You definitely right lockdowns, too. No. Repeating Haters gonna hate. think they're talking general Republican voters, much power vaccinated. Many also distrustful government efforts fight COVID. So, spreading rumor like would make likely get push representatives board fighting COVID. doctor asked depressed anxious told don’t know it’s covid working two jobs going school full time get masters teaching, able see friends, anxiety seeing anyone- uhhh yeah I’m bit everything right bit confusing, seems happened PA used doses reserved second doses gave people first dose instead?  caused 30,000 - 50,000 short (of Moderna vaccine) supply needed given people 2nd dose time due reschedule appointments? huge deal issue logistics tracking needs fixed future. No. wrote reply realized isn’t pregnant left food service workers like many others rough pandemic. 

If she’s refusing vaccinated shouldn’t working around others. understand worries pregnancy unknown effects vaccine. She’d better waiting baby she’s stuck takes vaccine may affect pregnancy later, doesn’t cannot work. someone cares working people emphasize position recognize she’s tough spot. 

I also think there’s likely story since let go potentially turning vaccine it’s pointless wonder aloud/argue that. said, there’s little room pandemic make room personal choices lead public health risks. 
So, I’m anyone refusing vaccine working job potentially spreads virus, I’m also fired conversation. really, took CNBG vaccine, first dose 4U/0.5mL, second one 6.5U/0.5mL Covid's R_0 number nowhere near high... Poor attendance doesn’t necessarily translate poor dysfunctional family. lot times happens individual doesn’t like rat cage they’re forced into.

The entire US education system first grade, way high school (and even public universities) fucking joke. teach propaganda brainwash youths part system suppresses them. don’t fit mold? Suspended. Expelled. Medicated. I'm afraid go outside. 

Therefore, entire world must stop going outside threat violence local governments. true info Fauci said last night CNN Moderna Pfizer vaccines effective B117 B1351. One better (can't recall which), effective preventing severe illness. really see variants problem. Exactly!! bring attendance people see problem 🤨 pushing empty syringe filled air someones veines lethal right? wtf That's confusing title. vaccine doses identical. guess they're saying is, vaccine doses supposed reserved second doses recipients mistakenly used first doses others. come time second dose earlier recipients, allocated/reserved second dose gone. added laws make clear ;) -

I responded really working would took time off. marked evaluation reported school bad attitude.

I sick month recurrent pneumonia. February last year. Since tested negative flu fever preceptor thought overtly dramatic coughing, wheezing, low pulse ox. 

I hate compulsory work culture, could died probably covid, student capstone clinical placement jeopardize 7 years medical education stand myself. 

It honestly worst really scared might collapse infect patients. scientists theorized case data came December, come making news? That's 100 masks, comes $3 per mask. hardware store area selling packs 1 day. $4 per mask . Whatever gets apartment. Every country response covid, many successful successful limiting spread virus. Accordingly, countries simultaneous drop infections cannot attributed idea global herd immunity, region different infection rates. herd immunity, see countries higher infection rates reaching drop earlier time points, countries lower infection rates reaching later.  I’m going second shot tomorrow. great news think I’ll continue planned. like cured post-viral syndromes. hope I'm 23 lost career. I'll get back lots determination can't get high school experiences back. lost important parts senior year, would devastated. might prom musical senior night... means something. 

Just know hear you. We've called selfish far long. I'm really quite tired becoming quite bitter it. lockdown happy politicians screw point. life might never same. confirm, high schooler. Haven’t stepped foot classroom since 2020 Mar 13. Online education laughable quality rigor, testing security nonexistent. don’t think legal vaccine emergency approval actually approved FDA. Pennsylania amending constitution prevent endless lockdowns.

Will become widespread? mean turned 30 quite young soooo many goals wanted finish 30 haven’t able work them. I’m moving 32 guess. definitely way better starting college though. would hard age Seriously? changes entire fucking playing field. newly vaccinated people wear masks/socially distance 2 weeks. literally missed 2 days school kindergarten senior year high school didn’t get recognized shit. could go back would cared much. work covid lab. bonus tied attendence. miss one day, even caught covid, lose bonus (1000.00). bosses idiots. fucking snowstorm! There’s bigger risk, sometimes vaccine fails. could ineffective, occasionally even cause ADE would make even vulnerable infection. rolled dice signed up, got lucky proved safe highly effective. Even *if* variants render vaccine ineffective, people still resume lives anyways. alternative live like forever, large events, socially distant gatherings, fake Zoom school... good luck convincing people much longer. pants gang! Farts kill grandma. Amazing much triggers people. Okay, let’s take CA example, it’s state live in. 

Right now, 65+, teachers, health care workers, restaurant workers, food + agricultural workers, critical manufacturing workers get vaccine. sure sounds like 20%....that’s huge number people. Seems around 40% so, minimum. meaningless statement using USPS lol Somebody said Biden said normalcy December? Anyone got source that? assume it’s way said things would worsen (they havent) said 1m day 100 days (were helluva lot more) remember one time, girl trying hard perfect attendance award. grandpa died year missed school go funeral. award handout day, cried. asked why, told them, got award anyway, special treat (I remember treat was). that, made special exceptions perfect attendance awards, sickness among them. joke is. India started vaccination 30+ days later US UK, I'd expect India become #1 absolute number terms another month two. India also excellent polio vaccination infrastructure reaching parts country, easily cross utilized.

In measure richer countries better throw money problem.

The important thing vaccines must continue available effective world. else learn work sick next nothing? news? Totally 100% legal make vaccination condition work. Really? stuff still transit, wherever Actually completely correct, case Pfizer Moderna vaccines blueprint thermal exhaust port (irl: spike protein), make nearly entertaining cartoon. spent 5 days hospital pneumonia years ago.  Got released Friday back work Monday.  week couldn’t miss more. state schools legally required meet parents whose students miss 10 days attendance plan made up. Usually around 5 days send letter home try avert 10-day meeting. attendance plans include helping families problem solve attendance issues happening often families connected various public services meetings.

Another part reason attendance measures schools accredited based number factors, state includes rate chronic absenteeism. student considered chronically absent miss 18 days (10% school year). threshold associated lower educational outcomes like GPA on-time graduation rate.

It’s likely getting notices automatic process. required state law, also help save school lot administrative time. school district around 1000 students around 30% chronic attendance rate. students 10-day meeting lasted hour average, that’s 300 administrative hours spent attendance meetings. also remember students getting support home your, others’, children getting. Missing much school make difficult students pass classes, get grades want, etc. don’t support home. strong, reach need talk. I'm sorry way feel like kids sick time. remember always was, friends kids always seem too. Spread schools fairly rare, professions above. changes recommend apply whether there's vaccine not. happened. one goal vaccine, remove potential virus overwhelm health systems. accomplish goal prioritize likely contribute overwhelming. priority. soon goal met go back normal. goal beyond unreasonable beyond societal goalpost imaginable outset this. vaccinate rationally can, oldest vulnerable youngest healthiest. soon clear risk health systems gone, squabble priority priority rest us done mess, finally. took recently learn feel like idiot low key lost wtf I’m doing. right refuse vaccine. right continue serving food customers continue working close quarters coworkers. 

Body autonomy arguments valid birth control abortion, primarily decision concerning body alone. vaccines, especially service sector job, decision get vaccine potentially affect coworkers customers. rights safe workplace food safety? 

The argument might different currently pregnant, not. Otherwise, couple start claiming they're trying get pregnant get mandatory vaccine requirement jobs. 

Finally, currently thousands people desperately work would happily take vaccine job. company perfectly within right set vaccine standards workforce. feels like concerns vaccine outweighs job, job go someone else. ever send sick kids school

Because kids home means parents home

And parents home means workers home

And workers home means wealth extraction ruling class confidence interval 68 98%, meaning 1 dose may low 68% effective. people study, results completely reliable u source chance?  CA last state get back normal (esp. bay area), normal summer country normal late spring. normal fall, everyone else mostly normal summer. 

The weekly supply vaccines expected continue increase. weekly vaccinations go everyone wants vaccine it, barring huge unforeseen disaster Moderna Pfizer.

The J&amp;J supply problems could mean increase slowly projected, hand Moderna announced able supply doses sooner originally planned, might cancel out. actual letter editor interested:  actually means whole lot people significantly protected RIGHT thought. Could explain cases trending faster anticipated. media bias looks like. protect Democrats detriment us all. Journalists need find integrity again. best way give businesses break purge society Coronavirus. worst way help businesses keep reopening every time infection rate dips slightly last year, leading another uptick infection rate another period lockdown.

Remember, infections multiply exponentially, potentially doubling every days week. Low infection rates become high infection rates really quickly, especially contagious variants running society. make sense. NYC NY State part whole country regards vaccination rates. check out. Change ""will become"", already endemic long time ago. used walk home alone kindergarten around lunch time watch TV older sister came home, also elementary school. two us would home alone couple hours parents came home work.

I even think that's legal anymore.  rarely, yes NYS rollout much track rest nation. Perfect love casts fear. wear 3 bulletproof vests still die someone pops head. baldness also related old? think doesn’t want make mistakes Trump. Trump notorious overpromising, i.e said we’d “roaring go Easter 2020”. Biden trying exact opposite. Underpromise vastly exceeded that. Numerous studies past months shown 1 3 people COVID-19 symptoms last longer typical two weeks. symptoms affect people sick hospitalized COVID-19, also milder cases. Lol. agree. Seriously, times I've wanted day scared use PTO, ended getting genuinely sick starting home. funny works. 

I try go PTO time proactively, avoid sick part enjoy catching life. think time ""open season"" vaccines, virus largely control anyway.

this thing June (my prediction) dad Rochester, vaccinated Wegmans really state. But, hear seems Walgreens releases new appts Wednesday mornings 1030 am. need account site see appointments. need Medicare insurance info schedule it. Take look Long Island local subreddit see people getting vaxed sites like CVS, etc.

Check state site even site says appts available, click thru get started w info keep checking queue day. Appointments come go day long fast. redditors luck using refresh extension browser.

You also see local county website queue. 

Honestly way much work seniors unfortunate. feel like nearly tips read people trying get seniors lives appointments. heart goes elderly vulnerable one. will. like they're telling them

I doubt they're telling them. Governments ignoring whole long hauler thing months, convenient them. totally still thing (or Covid), it’s ridiculous. daughter 4th grade, stopped classroom something, teacher commented “hey miss much school?”. kind surprised question. February she’d missed 5-6 days year, didn’t see, excessive me. told teacher incredulous. scoffed, “Only 5-6? ONLY? really don’t think realize much is. several children room haven’t missed single day school year. ever occur kid missing, need take time next day catch missed?“. mean, sorry teacher extra work result child sick, absolutely sorry would keep away others ill, allow rest recover. occurred teacher probably shamed daughter every time came back sick day, probably gave attitude catch missed. think toxic. What’s Israel though? would expected numbers plummet now, still highest case counts per capita world. Honestly though, that's kind point. Punishing attendance happens many days absent. allowed number absences consequences. I'm teacher kids absent much simply parents guardians really seriously negative effect kids' learning. Like HUGELY so. Like parents guardians actually need wake deal kind consequence many really care I'm saying this. Like parents really care. always poor thing either, sometimes rich kids take long vacations Europe middle year fall behind well. I've many rich kids absent extended periods time. Maybe take kids though dealt directly parents. However, attendance need taken seriously kids even starting Middle School start skipping fun showing late doing. really tricky. teacher performance judged based students' success, students absent lot underperforming result, still looks bad you, even though fault, lot work catch constantly. think need make staying home sick seen responsible thing, put much pressure 'perfect attendance' options parents employers take days stay home take care sick kids. Canada received like 0 doses they've bought, plan donating extras. That's hoarding, legitimately know vaccines get delivered, ordering 30 million one company, 30 million another, etc, maximize chances least one getting delivered sooner. people whine wearing masks entitled, whiny brats. city? California huge said friend works city government Ah okay, thanks clarifying. feels like hugely important topic, quite surprised see locked. little incident notwithstanding, think great job maintaing sub, thanks hard work! guy voted dismissing genocide.

You live that, me.  long delay? whole reason second dose really increase efficacy, increase length protection. far I'm aware there's data quickly immunity wears single dose. comment quoted exist? pretty much says 2/3 populace probably dont think real shits scary technically wrong, mink farms entirely different level unnecessary present different type threat. easily rid entire mink fur industry without issue, pushing end animal agriculture (which going happen) distraction. Let's focus things realistically slowly work toward larger issues. people would already adjusting, human resiliency change strong. well-known sub reacts certain messages. never read dismissive comments articles high death rates among minorities poorer nations get vaccine donations? COVID-19 around forever. Like every coronavirus ever existed. Eventually need come back earth. country implemented international system, rules regulations live today, care rest world???




lol







Also, said ""first world"" countries hoarding vaccine, america. confirm. Spring 2022? met many people? people would tolerate shit. 

Maybe international travel restrictions. 2 years this? Even CA people revolt. reason particularly aggressive beating drum year called every name book, proven right over. much patience anymore, I'm happy de-escalate productive conversations possible.

I believe studies relevant original discussion, risk children returning school including hypothetical largely unproven long term effects them. studies presented far exclusively related older, sick populations even then, focus extreme cases agree extrapolated general population. yet see credible evidence alleged conditions common serious threat overwhelming majority population, focusing strikes beyond point diminishing returns.

To point healthcare economic effects, find extremely foolish focus edge cases hypothetical, unsubstantiated fears wide-spread long term effects current solution incur definite, catastrophic damage economy terms unprecedented manipulation money supply destruction jobs. see payoff even close justified given current evidence. Headline may old news now. top page: 

""Due high demand N95 CUP respirators, model longer delivery time.""

Also, $80 20 slightly pricey. patient, N95s 2 popular companies (3M forgot other) show various hardware supply websites *think* cheaper per mask. /r/Masks4All keeps track that. feel, need compromise things gonna get worse. Damned do, damned don't.

Spreading 6 months trials worth it, think, still 4 months approval. much would adding extra month gain you? Maybe much either. 

I think made right call time. need structured trials ongoing test regimens. California I’m anything remotely resembling expert means, I’ve kind assuming it’s possible reasons case reduction working together, building upon other’s potential drop case rate form one whole super drop. You’ve got people infected already aren’t (for part) getting infected spreading it, vaccines top that, people take precautions top that, adding lack holidays major gatherings. like throwing many ways drop once. article:

The study also finds greater risk coronavirus infection severe outcomes communities larger proportions people color, higher numbers essential workers, higher rates mobility.

While yet formally peer reviewed, research reinforces one consistent findings throughout pandemic — inequity within Colorado across nation means burden virus falls differently different communities.

“This study us really underscores higher rates underlying health conditions, air pollution worse COVID-19 outcomes go hand-in-hand disproportionate impact communities color,” said Kristy Richardson, Colorado’s state toxicologist one authors study. CDPHE statistical analysts Kevin Berg Paul Romer Present also authors report. Fair enough. harsh. disagree blaming CCP think pandemic could significantly reduced honesty believe CCP deserves full weight Covid scorn thrown prevent future pandemics growing government secrecy. City that? Same! get uncomfortable seeing sort crowd gathering people talking eachother without masks, real life TV movies.

Worried pandemic going end that's still going unsettling. fauci buffoon went mall yesterday walked past store display mannequins wearing masks. That...was super weird. Outdoors precautions might possible summer agree. makes sound like it’s cool, cute trendy nothing truth. would take medicine work develop adenovirus resistance could make vaccines work future?  considered UK experts, concluded offset reduction number infected hosts virus mutate in. chances mutation reduced overall. give neighbours sell anyone wants buy them, sitting freezer. People die they're sitting freezer.  Thanks answer. Seems like trade rushing trials worth case. don’t think people realize this, many public health officials even calling things like bars clubs risky. ability get rid now, wouldn’t they? Masks compromise keep semblance 2019 looked like. think might needs get head sand I’m mad chose stay home years. wish Yeah but, vaccinates vaccinators? Disinformation not, still handled situation terribly I'm guessing citizen proven factually wrong. Deal that. ... think romanticizing 20s way much. like turn 30 old man allowed fun anymore. Anxiety! 

Especially neighborhood love become violent since Covid Edibles typically recommended purpose, absolutely correct different beast. hope find something works well you! Agreed. Bullet vaccine, choice apples oranges. Florida one oldest states population California one youngest. friend city government says they’re expecting May 2022 think post Covid normal  Pfizer vaccine effective first dose, really shouldn’t worried working variants.

You can't link 2 things together.

The antibody response Pfizer SA variant 1/3rd regular variant. first dose 92% effective regular Read it, misleading headline race much sub would lead believe. Every country goal: herd immunity. reach goal care countries. reached goal see reason us care others lol, much worlds sole super power, guess america interested outside world comes toppling democratically elected governements..

You're preaching choir, ""buddy"". either. country gives way many fucks what's going outside enough people within. I'm saying latter former.

Also US super power. see crying China, EU, really powerful 1st world nation sharing. US huh? Americans expected care foreigners lives I'm fucking sick it. Nah that's bullshit. one, average 40 year old going stable career higher income half age. comment definitely misleading - meant people would willing pay extra finally go festival order make profitable festivals Sinovac 50%. According China. That’s all. 

Moderna BioNTech kill sinovac 24/7. Nah, Vietnam started locking things January Covid started spreading rapidly Italy even. foresight early enough worked better anyone else. timing crucial, actually shut right things arbitrarily leaving somethings open closing things. short periods isolation, dragged year half-measures. media ""jump board"" started making noise ship already sailed. Here's article covering talking about. virus present sparking community outbreaks long exploded. reports free look up, early cases Washington state, California, BritishColumbia, Chicago detected appear lead community regarding ease transmission, here's early study Beijing showing household mask use dramatically reduced infections among residents. keep mind infectiousness may differ modern may also find science says online school less disruptive old people dying? Think lives saved making people anxious depressed. matter never goes away long community spread low enough odds ever catching low enough. bubonic plague never went away either I'm worried it. trust either, reach point described, last wall castle fallen give crap foregoing masks everywhere. (Exceptions places like hospitals would OK.) country got really impacted going seeing temps Monday, probably. think Sunday first day mostly behind us logistics standpoint. good evidence first dose 95% 14 too. reports erectile dysfunction following covid infections, appearance dangly bits concern, it’s fine. Everything’s fine. Try buy Pfizer US. UK. 

Israel paid December. Later country. 

Money Israel useless play role. 

Don’t calculate European money. pay EU. directly. I’m still depressed varying degrees like always been. still think aspects mood unique time since pandemic began. Life feels incredibly stale joyless now. It’s increasingly struggle find something hold interest awhile, let alone make happy. Make antidepressants cheap Thanks wife’s movie pick week ago, get username lol worst people think herd immunity like light switch. People heads nothing normal hit 75% vaccinated (or whatever number think represents herd immunity), hit number, everything 100% normal.

We gradual slope normality, we're already closer people think. don’t trust it. First two weeks vaccines vaccines good yet must keep indefinitely...

Whiplash. Absolutely! major economies.

The cost developing treatments vaccines drop ocean compared massive economic damage caused pandemic. best beaches world fully vaccinated population? Sounds like need take vacation Um well that’s happening, good evidence believe happen vaccines US, don’t see keeping kids school something that’s happening supported evidence happen near future Masks rules going change sizeable chunk US vaccinated. Depressed *restrictions*, depressed *virus*?

Pretty important distinction make, I'd bet. Honestly, less 50% win.

Or 2/3 denial You’re arguing straw man. Nowhere say US vaccinate population first, obviously control infrastructure logistics domestically. refusing break patent pursue coordinated global measures manufacture distribution vaccine almost guarantee worse state affairs future, US everyone else. obvious, risk mutated virus multiplies half vaccinated person increases. You’re arguing straw man. Nowhere say US vaccinate population first, obviously control infrastructure logistics domestically. refusing break patent pursue coordinated global measures manufacture distribution vaccine almost guarantee worse state affairs future, US everyone else. Well, mandate *double* masks... could go maskless wanted to. Normalcy something government gives us, way choose live, least far wearing masks goes.

I went grocery store maskless last week. genuinely forgot damn thing. Nobody said anything. Lockdowns, distancing, masks, permanent fact life. Even somehow Zero Covid never know, could come back, two weeks! Obviously done things like New Zealand, we're situation crashed economy 500,000 dead people. theoretical scenario, they'd need quarantine vaccine came. people decide go back normal, government. bs hahaha argument thought number low. think it’s accurate. “taking seriously” point geared toward anxiety. 

People still getting house and/or enjoying company friends &amp; family America least. visits done within government requested constraints capacity. aren’t much likely depressed. It’s risk/reward trade like anything else So, unions asking vaccines &amp; CDC recommendation compliance? Seems incredibly reasonable me. woohoo! also reported cases. Easter? Add four weeks post easter superspreader theyll bitching Natural herd immunity basically considered right-wing conspiracy point never discussed public discourse. Ah fine taken reasonable precautions. skipped Thanksgiving Christmas basically fine. still risk course, is. hilarious people who've saying months dismissed taking ""massive gambles"" sub, though wanted put everyone's lives red roulette table something. always common sense thing bearing mind 3 week trials set speed, finding efficient gap. may missed cases doubt missed 45% important we've seen pattern vaccines effective severe cases vs preventing mild ones.

I agree that's important enough. Preventing severe cases help us achieve herd immunity. prevent Covid related [organ [long [blood vaccine least 50% effective type infection herd immunity. would help ear pain, ones tried seal well around nose chin North American N95 masks. I’m aware. Florida family 100% ignored whole thing even though Covid killed family member. I'm getting 2nd dose today. delaying lol could see mask mandated finishing, masks still advised/ recommended. Especially ill / flu season Appreciate it! too! Yeahhhhh, I'm buying this. Recent studies show transmission via bags, food, things like next happening COVID surviving another apartment, air ducts, blown apartment incredibly unlikely. People say time conveniently forget grocery trip similar ""harmless"" activity. look Osterholm's comments like worst case scenarios- theoretically possible, plausible- I'm actively making plans around anything like that. see point, 300k seems outdated prediction point, appropriate month ago certainly now. open essential workers certain risk profile. Also - middle high school staff higher risk bc see kids older kids likely pass covid. could done efficiently Things improving people can't handle it.

Lmao lot people feel personally attacked statement, although 100% right one person district got perfect attendance every day Kindergarten 12th grade. either god level immune system real selfish person. It’s even COVID. USA, it’s depressing corrupted government thought lived great country. Interesting view. guess missed breaking GFA island Ireland EU weeks ago then? exactly need study figure out. people get extremely sick even know genetics clearly play role virus effects body. studies showing blood type plays role get really serious cases. go medical school? No. lie. total, UK US spent seven times upfront, per capita, vaccine development, procurement production European bloc Israels money came late upgrade anything. 

False, Israel paid November, upgrading plant Netherlands went Jan-February, furthermore production **still** ramped deal must investigated. 

lol, first investigate EU massive incompetency dealing pandemic, failure allocate funds vaccination effort mismanagement Israel taking vaccines Europe 

False, Israel taking vaccines Europe, buying vaccines Pfizer. Vaccines owned never owned Europe. shown still effective extended time frame? want get jab damn lol whatever makes go quicker / sooner I’m long results still want expect think one pretty fine 93% efficiency.

Also works poorly South African one bothering possibly boosting tiny bit rather give good protection others many possible later time instead anything give something work good one too. mom able schedule vaccination today Mass! It’s going relief family since she’s one household who’s high risk. US-made N95 masks sure actually N95. KN95 Chinese standard. Everything back normal Florida. us haven’t able get vaccinated yet. Businesses still closed. Work still remote.  Haha way they're going able enforce that. Memorial Day, projections current rates vaccination US. enough people received vaccine contracted virus herd immunity strong enough protect rest population. Hospital capacity threatened. High-risk populations already protected vaccine people wanted vaccine received one. Plus, good cutoff point right around many areas begin school year. That’s anyone saying. need continue mitigation efforts get people vaccinated. Yes vaccines now, stop mitigation efforts early give existing new variants future new variants far greater chance escape immunity. 

Think way, 18hr flight coming landing, severe storms ahead, don’t take seatbelt yet. True. still need provide basic safety. Also, 30
30% population disabled, would effect too. Someone pay disability many countries also healthcare. Billie Eilish Voice: Duh. I'm depressed climate change

Come boomers 😎😎 think across US. europe probably not. 2/3 completely fucking detached reality point. Hope country oh oversimplified? could update stop saying lol, want provide inaccurate info oxford/AZ's situation US obvious science done year ago. That's life expectancy works. Here's Again, think everyone knows people still become affected vaccination. topic hand if, much, people spread virus vaccination. doubt that's going happen. fun that. FTA:

- China Russia offering fill gap. 

- rollout vaccines developing countries diplomatic battle western countries currently losing, 

- We’re talking billions doses immediately, billions billions euros. It’s much rapidly allocating 4-5 per cent doses have. 
“It won’t change vaccination campaigns, **each country set aside small number doses transfer tens millions them, fast, people ground see happening**.” so, think CDC/WHO eventually give clear masks? like they've said vaccinated people longer need follow quarantines. think official date say ""okay masks longer necessary."" 

the reason ask bc I'm seeing people who've vaccinated wearing masks, people who've wearing them, anti-maskers, vaccinated people wearing masks, double maskers, people happy mask next year. personally fall category happy mask long necessary. thing know long ""necessary"" is. wanna irresponsible potentially go maskless early, also want someone wears long past they're needed. 

(and know we're still months away least. something I've thinking bc I've seeing more) know find study side effects safe vaccine is? know show medication tv tell side effects preexisting conditions take it? Thank It’s strange come theories like don’t seem know why. can’t give us answers observations. cap looks like we’re gonna negotiate experts, I’d rather wear masks sticking stance going anywhere indoors taboo. Wonder used one tests fda warned might miss without masking repeatedly proven unsafe inadequate plain **wrong*"" former occupant house white repeated spreaders probably won't. Allergic reactions happen within minutes application all, personnel ready let know.

People vaccinating means Covid become endemic live every years optional, unless like lockdowns getting vaccinated anyways due mutations almost bad guy [impersonated officer get free drink Golden Corral. People make jokes common core math don’t understand math works. 

Common core math way codifying weird tricks use (based number theory) heads without knowing it. looks dumb every trick easy every person, idea least one tricks click you. seems extra dumb feels like “the hard way”, brain subconsciously breaks tricks presented hard problem, like sort practice, examples first steps given easier problems

It also promotes better understanding core concepts math *work* makes transition algebra calculus easier. algebra arithmetic actually rules, arithmetic simple case millions us already depressed even COVID 19. going permanently mandated. one wants that. *trudeau

Okay whatever. lost track you’re saying I’ve thinking too. Must reason it’s way obvious otherwise. Haha, sweet summer child. We're little...ahead curve San Francisco [*sniffs*] Thaaaaaaaanks☺️ that's definitely oversimplification, would rather said acting dumfounded whole situation. literally beyond you. take look does, beyond you. Humans also like infected. high risk COVID-19 infection likely experience psychological distress. many people suggesting legitimately go 1 dose.  argument simply delay 2nd dose certain amount time supply low order get people protected, even full protection. 2nd dose would still given, later interval (some jurisdictions going 42 days, — UK notable, going even longer, 12 weeks) seems like limited amount data make major decision.

I think enormous amounts data qualify us make decision. We're losing thousands lives per day, hundreds thousands per month suffer severe damage health, millions suffer damage mental health, hundreds billions dollars economic damage per month. know happening good estimates numbers component damage. 

To act like need perfect RCT implement probabilistic approach damage mitigation egregious illogical way handling information unknowns have. here... seems UK approved Astrazenica faster fixed faults factories. EU approved later, started producing meet quota due issues. countries faced issues seems UK put plan action faster ironed kinks. EU pretty poorly compared Western countries. think vaccinate people based trials suggested. complete new trial indicating waiting safe effective, would full support, I’m entirely comfortable changing plan without clear scientific evidence. [efficacy data vaccine 95% effective preventing covid19. 100% efficacy; *possible people vaccinated become infected.*

“A total 43,548 participants underwent randomization, 43,448 received injections: 21,720 BNT162b2 21,728 placebo. 8 cases Covid-19 onset least 7 days second dose among participants assigned receive BNT162b2 162 cases among assigned placebo; BNT162b2 95% effective preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 100%) observed across subgroups defined age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, presence coexisting conditions.”

Pfizer found zero severe critical cases within trials, zero symptomatic infections. is, therefore, possible fully vaccinated person develop symptomatic illness.

Data Israel suggests transmission vaccinated individuals unvaccinated individuals significantly reduced. Scientists enough data determine much, time. internet search pull preprints, you’re interested. knew along. question last long enough. Sure, masks also existed COVID. I'm sure people utilize they're sick scenario they're worried getting sick, vast majority people wearing pandemic over. can’t ways. vaccine effective SA variant doses delayed. Hesitancy refusal take vaccine plus less access white counterparts equals fewer vaccinations groups. 3D print clip buy goes behind head make tighter. 3M KN95 masks, 9505+ comes plastic clip.

I've used 3D printed clips KF94 masks (Korean standard). like fit better typical KN95. outbid. Like auction, admit is. Yup, never anxiety covid sudden noticed it. negotiations Scott Jensen (the doctor article) states Covid deaths cause hospital network receive income Medicare providers. Jensen also states believe Covid fatalities reported reported. USA today article picking opinion MAY possible administrators game system. following posts Jensen, clearly states believe happening. Read source material posted. aside, think facilities receive funding covid deaths. want make sure hospital administrators gaming system, perhaps install government oversight healthcare network, demonitize healthcare industry together. Agree completely. need bash all; even people agree her. made choice, lives consequences. like rest us. Ah yes someone like forced take vaccine probably kill thanks allergies have... I’m calling shenanigans. anxious person I’ve gone general social anxiety “oh god world falling apart even faster expected.”

I’ve gone “I’m afraid losing parents” “my parents won’t stay home fucking pandemic.”

I’ve gone “I’m enough make world better place” “I literally might kill someone existing”.

I’ve gone “people cruel” “people literally watch die keeps inconvenienced”

I’ve gone “I don’t like going politically” “don’t worry hun that’s flashbangs bullets, let’s try get sleep” “it’s ok, plan go today (1/6) kicks anything bad”

I days HR literally *double* pre pandemic. I’m anxious struggle focus enough complete basic tasks daily tasks living. Aparently I’m fucking broken even successful anxious person. Sure keeps safe, safe meaning know protect loved ones, it’s survivable way live.

I’m glad can’t relate, that’s you, everyone made impervious illness. human body isn’t meant spend much time red alert confirm. Bro last year fun either still beats shit dead. real, awful year feel way. I've never grateful life. I'm sorry man. I’m confused, “rate” amount tests affect much? symptomatic people encouraged get tested? think many people would thrilled pay even usual attend attendance expected lower god, crap human is.

And complete idiot. best definition man can't math.

Math Macron: could help 5% 20 mln, current vaccination rate EU, Africa 1 bln inhabitants? Firstly, vaccine nationalism EU, we're probably world's biggest exporter them.

Second, American, bit hypocritical calling us vaccine nationalism since we're ones exporting canada US blocked exports. Ya, different researchers making argument late December early January based NEJM study.  don’t new info, it’s 2 Canadian researchers throwing hat pro-delay 2nd dose argument.  aren’t official body recommending it. find experts making exact argument January based study, one form letter editors NEJM.

With said, seems growing consensus delay 42 weeks fine (CDC, WHO, Canada’s NACI, EMA, etc) South African variant may affect depending level spread variant jurisdiction level immunogenicity required (the booster greatly increases immunogenicity — 1 shot may give enough immunogenicity neutralize strains, may need added immunogenicity booster neutralize SA variant) see mandated restrictions could exist past summer efficacy vaccines. Many countries ordered far need. country, Canada, example this. long term effects dangerous, allowed intentionally infect people (for research)?

Agreed, hopefully squash sooner later variant comes circumvent vaccines. Granted, knowledgeable variants form that’s something worried not. Oh man, people said social media, thought entire year mask mandates 1918. Man!!!! 6 weeks total!!! California bet 2-3 years.  today says antibodies plummet 66% SA Pfizer vaccine third effective original variant.

[Completely onset protection one dose BNT162b2 precedes development high neutralizing titers, BNT162b2 immunization **also elicits CD8+ T-cell responses**. **Thus, unclear effect reduction neutralization approximately two thirds would BNT162b2-elicited protection Covid-19 caused B.1.351 lineage SARS-CoV-2.** Yes, unless parents decide establish actual homeschoolers, it’s better kids public education system whole, many different reasons

Never seen survey says 80% parents want continue remote learning, even actually case, I’m pretty sure they’d change minds presented actually honest cost benefit analysis rather screeching media it’s super duper unsafe kids I'm sure Biden fix it. article literally says reason analyzed people looking data. arguing study itself, also using justification distancing idea.

This also even current problem. age demographic highest tier. exacerbated problem (A) definitely enough data (B) majority racial demographics even allowed, via tiers, get vaccine?

I'm arguing problem, now, results data racial distribution upper bracket age demographic. would make sense open vaccine sites areas people live right now? get overly fantasized anecdotal scenario even happened happen since data states said consider equity reported numbers Spain sorry excuse country moment. mind us. happily waste doses pretend everything fine. You’re suggesting diverting tested proven approach *definitely* save lives taking one *may* save lives. 

You don’t without extremely confident work. 

This isn’t situation say “what lose” lose millions people would fully vaccinated current, proven approach. worriers think SA variant resistant Pfizer vaccine. true, 2nd shot shouldn’t delayed. Thank much taking time type me. Appreciate you. response? media refuses address explicitly. Look “Bristol Variant”. discovered within two months Uk variant. Woohoo fucking shit  Twitter, criminal cases...all shit control. But, control thoughts energy. Well, least can. know details. think citizens allowed. believe go visit even quarantine hotels. I'm one two three depressed anxious reasons outside covid-19 fact low chance dying, get probably going spread virus contribute problems come pandemic. highly contagious hard detect, simply can't say ""oh let everyone responsible themselves, get willing take risk"" works 80/20 kind fashion small group people irresponsible causes outsized negative effect everybody else. They're FDA approved, they're authorized EUA, huge difference. 

The FDA retract EUA authorization bunch failed N95 testing exact story posted 7 days ago: top post thread lists several vendors may able provide masks. ordered I've got far update order delayed due Texas turning frozen wasteland. *raises hand* yes World puts actions place stem pandemic per experts advice. Experts suprised see cases drop.

Are really wondering what’s causing this?! respond you’re going intentionally avoid question asked? think easier said done. hard tell communities teachers themselves.  balancing act sucks... 

Personally, think teachers get vaccinated least. They're front line. schools follow precautions. Make day today. believe you! first one: Florida lockdowns last year?

They mild lockdowns Spring. example, Disney World closed 4 months, restaurants closed 2 weeks flatten curve, etc., etc. implemented mitigation measures (masks, etc.) taken steps (prohibiting hospitals sending COVID positive patients back nursing homes), largely eschewed long-term lockdowns adopted places like Second one: data Florida suggesting lockdowns didn’t help much virus transmission based climate?

Yes. Florida's death rates considerably better many states implemented hard lockdowns despite Florida lot factors suggest Florida perform worse (very, old population, lots large cities, high rates poverty, lots tourists/snow birds coming state, etc.). hard look Florida's data conclude extremely restrictive lockdowns California (for example) much effect, any, mitigating spread. NZ still quarantine hotels? must let people in? I'm trying patronise original comment btw. genuinely interested nearly 14 months Ultimately lockdowns far damage Covid ever would have. truly believe social media either become death society. banned. cannot see country like US banning. speculating, though think restrictions drop masks. think we’ll see things like indoor dining reopening, occupancy limits dropped, perhaps distancing reduced 6 3 feet. gradually happen summer, vaccinations available masses, think we’ll see masks go away (except places like hospitals, doctors offices, dental offices, healthcare settings). sums 95% people sub. Maybe, Russian government acted good faith decades, can't tell truth save lives, trusting word life saving vaccine terrible.... yet people still going afraid anything next couple years No. lot people would still go way avoid catching COVID even mandated law. relatable spreading fake news seem sunken far weird swamps Spectator, Times, Independent Daily Mail even notice. South African mutation debate anyways. huge drop cases world wide ? vaccinations / new mutation detectable ? 😨 manager asked Brummett Feb. 11 wear mask comply public health guidelines, Brummett allegedly pointed belt badge said, ""Do know means? I'm 'U.S. Marshal' arrested force wear mask,"" according complaint. 

Arrested forcing U.S. Marshal wear mask, haaaaahahahaha, couple donkeys. shit? Vaccines effective variants (well, AZ isn’t effective SA variant rest are). Death also permanent that's risk too. extremely rare age range think big deal obviously volunteers agree. What, pray tell, mentally healthy way deal fact people stealing future? parents don’t want send kids back? forced? 

I don’t necessarily disagree logic, many districts (such Chicago) close 80% parents said want continue remote learning. Risky comment day. chances 50 year-old healthy male dying Covid19 20 times high 30-year old healthy female. pretty liberal thinking. There’s difference 1 mask 2 masks. know places pretty much letting anyone in. New Zealand example. I'm interested person's story. imagine away wife long. dystopian, seems likely countries view workers rights communism comparison wrong one. 

This isn’t like trying experimental drug “what lose?”

We system **definitely** works one system *possibly* works. 

Which makes cost wrong significantly higher. don’t withhold proven drug (2 vaccines) one could possibly work (one vaccine) based anything concrete data. This. hate this. suicidal well COVID, ever talk response get everyone's struggling right eventually pandemic over. Cool, I'll still suicidal over, thanks trying guess. Yes I’ve saying while. hygiene theater dictates so. take control physical health That's company headline, fair. point companies competitive, lumped together one easy buy still expensive $2.25 pop mask, least regular better terms quality compared China made masks.

We know company’s masks certified National Institute Occupational Safety Health, division Centers Disease Control Prevention, Mr. Bielamowicz says many buyers reluctant give unfamiliar products try. Big hospitals prefer stick masks already use time-consuming need fit-test new models employees. many cost-conscious bulk buyers prefer purchase cheaper Chinese painful rebuffs came Tarrant County, Mr. Bielamowicz’s factory located. Last month county disqualified company’s bid officials wanted buy specific Chinese-made models. County officials respond requests comment.

It looks like different enough quality, position deciding use actual patients, unknown. Better safer (China masks also FDA/NIOSH approved) take unnecessary costs risk.  maybe perception truth distorted brainwashing. I'm saying kids great remote school, know plenty access inequalities, kids learn best person, kids learning disabilities real choice equal education remotely, etc. 

But keep seeing, ""#FACTS REMOTE SCHOOL UNIVERSALLY BAD KIDS SUFFERING LITERALLY MOMENT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IRREPARABLY DAMAGE FOREVERMORE MIGHT WELL TOSS BACK SCHOOL EVEN ANYONE'S CHANCE GET VACCINATED, REGARDLESS COMMUNITY SPREAD LEVELS PARENTS, TEACHERS STUDENTS GIVEN AREA ACTUALLY WANT. CITATION: TRUST BRO ""But kids struggling!"" place that's universal truth, either. 

It's doom gloom EVERYBODY. feel people good options struggling, though. hope relieved soon vaccine levels increase things open more.

But know kids fine remote really struggling. Maybe they're minority think quiiiiiiite absurd divide many people claiming online (many even seem kids?)

I also love people willing throw kids better different teaching style bus get majority (usually) typical kids ""back normal"" ASAP. 

My son struggled typical person instruction past that's bad guess. Can't possibly keep remote options going teachers want ""the exceptions"" because...reasons?

It seems like indeterminate number typical kids* can't hack year slightly different instruction guess screw everyone else who's getting needs met once. fair! *other* kids supposed struggle!

Good times. 

*My typical kid problems either, thankfully. know special needs kids struggling already addressed above. 

It seems like people using existence special needs students nebulous claims mental health push agenda forward even though never seemed care either subject pre-Covid.

The thing is, I'm opening schools hybrid models that's works families teachers done following recommended health guidelines. 

Hell schools options months I'm glad accommodate everyone's needs. 

But courtesy extended anyone wants keep remote options open longer. already see remote options dropping off. daughter's school already removed remote option next fall (August, area) even though still unknown adults want vaccinated chance then, kids definitely won't. least community spread seems decline. guess that's going good enough unless want go fully homeschooling route.

It's funny observe. care people's kids getting educated sure seem determined take away remote options RIGHT SECOND convinced anyone could possibly want despite parents, teachers kids like, ""but working us now."" 

Every time subject comes someone says ""ZOOM DOESNT WORK"" like kind absolute truth refute ""It's working us!"" I'm quickly shouted people get BIG MAD anyone dared good experience it.

Someone thread said give kids adoption thriving, lololol. Alrighty then. Get mental health business  lost 20 lbs last year. 200 first time least 5-6 years. started eating less cooking home bc pandemic financial concerns. I’m pro vaccine, actually agree. don’t think businesses legally mandate EUA vaccine. know country full faith home grown vaccine instead using every resource help people, instead start exporting instead. like Russians started export vaccine refuse reveal many peopled vaccinated. Perhaps quarantined everyone month quarantined incoming arrivals eliminated COVID country. Oh wait - countries worked pretty well. 

If asked beginning pandemic ""do want save 70 year olds want save everyone?"" theres exactly one sane answer question.

Also long elderly people quarantined, anyway? Forever? would help . Russian vaccine excellent. take passes tests. Russia excellent scientists. That’s never get people say large outdoor gatherings last thing come back. Seems like last June made pretty clear people wear masks, gathering outside one lowest risk things do. IMO it’s way dangerous indoor dining 50% 500-1000 people standing around outdoor stage Following CDC guidelines, setting example since they’re asking citizens mask up. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Patients receiving cancer also often masked cold flu season help reduce chances infection. ...alternative...plans...? would political suicide go maskless now. would expect wait bare minimum 1-2 months vaccinations available everyone. Technically, less different contacts probably reduces risk. pizza shop full germs, one driver gets sick instead 500 customers. (assuming come close contact driver germs linger pizzas) trust Canada this. Canada allowed 30 y/o friends vaccinated ahead elderly. Canada vaccinating remote communities isolate far easily communities dense urban areas higher risk infection. Canada sure priorities straight. need job tbh Yeah takeaway too. Everyone focused lower efficacy, without thinking vaccines probably would shown similar number tested one dose. Considering small fraction population actually risk Covid, essentially eliminate hospitalizations deaths.

I wonder media (and sub) focus terms fear mongering time. agreed abide rules attending school there. break want, get caught punished I'm going complain unfair happened; decision. Self diagnosed I'm sure Basically, everything trending good right now. Cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping. Vaccine delivery increasing. Studies consistently showing vaccines effective forms COVID. Producers increasing production goals. Yes that’s good point too, lot government forced people burned trying best stay safe.

I’m trying argue lockdowns I’m trying point fact news headlines usually pin blame Covid Covid didn’t cause depression, lockdowns did.

Even article says that, doesn’t mention COVID-19 continues pose serious threats public health worldwide, interventions lockdowns, quarantine, social distancing adverse impact mental well-being. - spreading fake news. like mentally ill crackpot Macron. Alright. going assume trolling move on, willing listen, I'd willing engage you.

In regards benefits thing - think everyone benefits. get absolutely hosed country labor rights, hurts us. Every American worker get sick days, vacation days, parental leave, health dental insurance.

I'd curious think teachers work 25% less lawyers accountants. vacations?  vaccinations get country point zero COVID (or nearly so) go back normal school? R0 &lt; 1 Thanks CDC. Far saying necessary emphasising special cases view necessary. avoided question strawman argument. engage logical fallacies, especially ones make argument defend. never said problem part strategy recruiting kids. answer obviously: they're minus recruiting kids. theater locals despise Chinese, see anyone taking shit all, someone lives Namibia, somebody offered Chinese vaccine, would tell fuck honest. reddit always finds way  President Biden VP Harris still wearing double masks? would think fully vaccinated? guess it’s set example anything else? red pill? depressed cool testing important, must done precautions serious.

They’re factories, nothing more. I'm pretty convinced European leaders screaming variants cover lackluster vaccine rollout. Trying make leaders look totally incompetent keep restrictions far past anyone anticipated. Florida strong decline cases since January without lockdowns. pretty easy choice I'd rather right Thanks info.  


So, interest bridge? pretty sweet deal, say myself. One problems sick binary thing.

For instance, would considered sick enough stay home light sniffles feel tired? still get work seen making meaningful contribution work.

People shout ""stay home sick"" much want -- but, without clear definition ""sick"" means particular workplace community, still balancing question whether co-workers think wimp staying home still move (which get ostracized/fired) abstract idea staying home protect others. I've never able crack own, want seen team player.

The answer, course, provide clear guidance means sick means particular workplace. 

A checklist you, boss, co-workers agree reasonable would good start. No, still sucks. ~~floggings~~ lockdowns continue morale improves How'd happen? suggesting offer evidence compliance safety measures doesn’t occur, break outs happen. 

I’ll agree effective way minimizing death transmission

I don’t agree this. moment, imagine totally different hypothetical disease kills 100% people age 65 0% people 65. Vaccinating anyone 65 population 65 population wouldn’t make sense, don’t die all. vaccinate people die disease first because, that, death rate plummets people start returning normal life. primary goal stop transmission. Transmission necessary condition widespread death, sufficient. far harder stop transmission requires vaccination many people. goal stop people dying corona, best way give vulnerable population vaccine first. also faster way. meet target first quarter. second quarter, said might even overdeliver. cant compare vaccine manufacturing phone assembly. Apple pays companies assemble phones them, pharm companies license permission manufacture vaccines pay royalties. 
Without many companies involved manufacturing, it’ll take lot time scale production doesn’t happen, gives chances virus mutate especially already many variants causing scare vaccine efficacy particular strain

Ok guess Americans treat COVID sort zero-sum situation isn't. fuck taking vaccine protecting others? What's choice got stopping others getting vaccine? Don’t link trial, nursing school near allowing get vaccinated. ‘trial’ optional monitoring blood draws stuff Vitamin C boost immune system. beat depression year covid. Started relapsing week. least time obvious outside causes. Gonna pull through, damn, feel shitty right now. Yes, absolutely this. Actually, knowledge, *none* places this. would help immensely 1 star reviews company 5 stars. looks like issues delivering masks much customer service presence. also charge almost $4 per mask.

This small business spent fortune shifting production masks without buyer, forgoes advertising, marketing, logistics, customer service, trying recoup costs selling masks nearly 4 times cost sufficient masks. bad logistics, typo ridden webpage, customer service.

Buy risk, whoever ran business incompetent, made shit gamble, deep doodoo. think want long-term zero covid policy. everyone get vaccinated, anti-vaxxers getting COVID prompt lockdown sort government response, assume. cares, long lead massive outbreak? knew day 1 mostly older people people underlying conditions vulnerable. day 1 people saying young healthy people careful protect vulnerable. 

Even followed proper protocols, many countries would completely ravaged virus. countries faster successful recoveries Asia-Pacifc region, original strains virus less contagious hit Europe/Italy. countries remote urban centers, less mingling populations. (Intra-city pop density appears correlation)

But beginning hospitals danger overflowing, right reaction learned proning therapy remdesvir ok segregate employment anyone may want get pregnant? I’m already used ""Fortunately, one immune escape protein found sample. situation deemed serious one detected. variant detected South Africa."" 

Nothing serious see folks, many vaccines still shown effective SA variant (although lower rate) variant even dangerous e484k see much reason concern. remember future brain part body mental health days normalized accepted.

There times kneeew take day would either useless work I'd get fired losing someone. I'd take sick day I'd feel much much better going back. rather countries strong systems, like Germany, support businesses employees situations

Emmm, ever Germany? Germany sucks lol. 2/3 94% effectiveness prevent symptomatic infection = 62% effectiveness now? support troops. ought advertise fact world's second-highest vaccination rate. private company. “Covas give details exactly effective vaccine proved strains.”

Yeah okay DECADES. 

I don’t think anyone fathom impact next 30+ years students experienced return schools/graduate/go college/join workforce/follow life pathway. taught every young person country school/work/whatever done home proper structures exist (but don’t know build proper structures). still pretty empty north. hospital let go like 200 employees last July slow There's moderna trial opening area, hope able sign up, mostly best chance getting vaccine.

Plus, 50 years I'll cool story tell participated clinical trial. Good question. takes lot practice education. Reading papers get better reading papers, even important developing general knowledge whatever field (through schooling books), discussing science people, research yourself. things get familiar whatever research interested in, determine things like whether statistics use rigorous, whether experiments well designed, whether results meaningful greater context field, etc.

If plan go college, might want try checking labs studying things interested seeing volunteer them. fact, opportunities high schooler well. Getting exposure science firsthand help realize good scientific method looks like quality people's research. northern Alberta. school division policy sending sick kids home. acted upon least 25 years. tell I’m wearing mask forever. first year ten years one family sick colds flu. Lesson learned better none. 13.5M now. keep thinking past prologue boggles mind. Translation: high testosterone actual correlation edited comment reflect correct information double check info implant. article sent says genetic factor causes weight gain, birth control itself. pedantic quite honestly affected number women small it’s even worth mentioning. Back whole point dumb argument: Control weight diet exercise. Adjust accordingly based medications doctors recommendations, almost certainly involve DIET EXERCISE. He’s one voices reason throughout whole mess. Meanwhile people like Osterholm still claiming “cat 5 covid hurricane” weeks away. Blood drawn daily 2 weeks? Sounds like vampire cult. yeah think would apply, I'm racist 

But honestly, black woman, would advise much powerful manner. Black women higher risk contracting dying covid. top that, heard mortality rates among black women giving birth? “Take vaccine isn’t approved tested long term you’re fired” pretty damn slippery slope man.

Next could can’t cross state lines. Can’t go grocery store. Can’t leave house. 

I fine vaccine requirements general it’s ridiculous suspect something hasn’t even existed year. ""Someone severe multiple sclerosis solid organ transplant probably likely die HEALTHY 65+ year old. magically become much susceptible COVID minute hit 65. moving goalposts around dishonest.""

Once ignoring fact general guidelines due fact large population diverse group people. can't make perfect system. helping vulnerable people quickly possible. ignoring fact making outlier comorbidities, multiple sclerosis keep naming, exceptions would greatly slow process whole.

""Your original argument 'well people going fall cracks that's fine' ignoring fact average going harder disabled and/or sick person drive three hours someone 65 healthy. 65 year olds stop able drive either.""

I never said fine. Stop putting words mouth. said extremely complex problem every decision pros cons. fact matter is, governments job provide value greatest amount people possible. giving 10000 people comorbidities vaccine makes 100,000 65+ people cannot get timeframe, terrible trade off. (Obviously made numbers principle). job right immunize many vulnerable people possible fast possible, they're targeting largest vulnerable groups, smallest.

"" Stick one argument. ""

I one argument, considering even figure one correctly, see think there's multiple lmao ""Some may die, that's sacrifice I'm willing make."" want clean toilet, excuses? Absolutely not. objectively, undeniably

Cringe. School kid. grew asthma missed good bit school - even summer school one year missed much. 

Its something control. people great health hardly ever get sick, others much. Things like make sickness moral failure make sich kids feel like failures get sick. Yes, that’s correct.

I would correct someone well said “driving simply risk me”. 

Nice try, though. blew low death lead, like Falcons lol love winter year. like need many vaccinations possible tho lmfao often kids sent school knowingly sick. tell us parents medicine feel better. Around 11 fever, diarrhea nausea back magically can’t get ahold parents. three beds nurses station full plus chairs office. pre covid, I’m looking forward reopen. whole system awful. Weird conclusion make then, annoyed vaccine side effects, really doubt actually mechanism vaccine affecting mental health negatively fuck back /r/badunitedkingdom , new home /r/Europe IHOP near me, plastic box , filled silverware. host/hostess reached box takes required amount guests. box located right middle crowded waiting area. 
I still get people need eat restaurants. delivered curbside.
Yeah get free refill bit, come on. “The variant going kill us need panic give us clicks way last March” - Media semantics. 

Your quote "" \~51% 14 days first dose 80% 28 days first dose (see Table 15 linked FDA/Moderna document below). "" wrong. 

It 92% 14 days according source give. extraordinarily uninspirational ""goal.""

The equivalent, Biden football coach:

(1) 2 minutes left game

(2) team ball, 3 points.

(3) 1st-and-goal opponent's 1 yard line.

Biden would kick field goal. play win simply tie game hope something better indeterminate time future? HARAMBE  Gorillas pretty chill, anything upset them. Even then, they'll usually warn stepping line.

Chimps, hand... protests last summer provided enough evidence indicate perfectly safe outdoors, even though BLM movement would instead produce revisionist history take protestors side police reform wearing masks 24/7. Probably powerful people said beginning Herd immunity attainable would result cataclysmic amounts death.

Those people can't wrong, job right. Yet Amazon express shipping gets stuff delivered 30 minutes lol gotten IEP 504 plan?

Last year, pick son school many times ""couldn't handle him.""

Once diagnosed ADHD autism, got IEP file he's Behavior Intervention Classroom now. Paul George you? Keep going. better! Let’s get behind us. Yeah surprised controversial opinion school helps prepare students college workforce. take 12 full years understand concept professionalism definitely helped consistently practice principles throughout childhood teenage years. not. risk driving testing center too. People died driving medical appointment. can’t go leaving house thinking risk, that’s true. 😆 remember told teachers public school funding school based student attendance, enrollment. always saw real reason perfect attendance emphasized. people like constantly advocate for?

Who ""people like me?""

You're generalizing ""enemy"" critical thinking point view. Cause literally asked feeling unwell. think Right. EU sucks now. think arguing semantics here. 

There 7 TOTAL cases vaccine group 28-day period. Overall entire 28 days 80%.

5 7 total cases happened first half 28-day period (within FIRST 14 days followup first dose). period 51%. say *at* 14 days measuring cases entire 14-day period.

The remaining 2 cases happened second half 28-day period first dose (within 15 28 days followup first dose). period 92%. good. I'm pay taxes. I’m expert stuff all. indeed pattern H1N1 2009-2010 Spanish Flu pandemic century ago. 2009-10 pandemic first emerged April 2009 believe late 2010 declared over. Roughly 18 months.

We’re almost 14 months since first reports virus came China. don’t think it’ll one reaches 18 month mark, predict mostly behind us end 2021 (24 months).

Pure speculation. high school, seniors exempt final exams (unless state exams) perfect near perfect attendance (I think straight allowed miss two days, Bs one, Cs zero). didn’t miss single day. take carpentry class exam cause state exam. News flash: us would rather risk long Covid live rest lives hiding virus. SA government completely abandoned AZ vaccine plans give African countries widespread SA Variant. addition, ZA said making new vaccine SA variant estimate ready September.

Christmas new years things probably would started drop late December January. Probably part due restrictions part due immunity. 

That's happened though. Christmas New Years infections kept things going extra month. Lots people got infected subsequently immune. instead R value dropping .9 .8 extra infections caused overrun plus warming weather caused drop .5 so. 

Essentially cased propped bad weather lots private gatherings, stuff gone rug pulled say. people downvoting yikes Right, comment alarmingly touch didn’t shut hospitals every healthcare worker got vaccine idk schools different give N95s (didn’t even give lots healthcare workers interacting confirmed COVID patients those) go work safely. 😂😂😂 that's nuts!!

Policy legislation written moneyed interests, moneyed interests. also parents nowhere else put them. asked almost countries. seems every government, allow enter country all, wants see proof negative test results and/or quarantine, proof full vaccination.

Whereas i’ve seen vaccinated individuals sharing experiences far worse days.

Ironically - thankfully - seems older people don’t experience bad side effects; younger worse is. Personally think states prioritized non-medical essential workers (teachers, grocery workers, housekeeping, fire, police, manufacturing, etc) next medical workers nursing home residents. Instead states like Ohio opened second round general population 80+, 70+, 65+, people born birth defects - physical mental, go “oh wait! need get teachers vaccinated school year starts over!” stick mix 70+. bunch people mad “teachers cut line front them”. Sorry, people luxury staying home avoiding infected people next anyway. People retired risk health life like usually oldest groups people bringing need groceries like anyway. mostly even getting public everyday. Trump tried hide come over. dropping sure means herd immunity. lot people staying home going pandemic, untapped market virus. people decide numbers dropped enough safe return, virus new resivour people infect.

Luckily good vaccine, also people contact lots people already got it. super spreader events much rarer. Reported misinformation. fuck people get news. Lol okay. Please continue framing something don’t even concrete numbers on. That’s totally sane. Good job!

Yet part group reason. Dude even CDC points unclear right now. PLEASE give easy peasy scientific data. mean short google search you. :D

&amp;#x200B;

CDC: Updated Feb. 12, 2021

What know

Scientists working learn variants, studies needed understand:

&amp;#x200B;

* widely new variants spread
* disease caused new variants differs disease caused variants currently circulating
* variants may affect existing therapies, vaccines, tests

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What means

Public health officials studying variants quickly learn control spread. want understand whether variants:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spread easily person-to-person
* Cause milder severe disease people
* detected currently available viral tests
* Respond medicines currently used treat people COVID-19
* Change effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines

I repeat please start back arguments scientific data. :D

&amp;#x200B;

There scientific study right availably proving argument ? fair, hydroxychloroquine got bad rap thanks politics surrounding it. Trials show much good hospitalized patients already severe symptoms. lot promising research regarding use outpatient settings mild cases. seems like keeping severity low, possibly decreasing long-hauler cases used early on. know proportions are? Biden (or Trump, Future President Miley Cyrus) say whatever want, end day society chooses go back normal. 

This summer seems reasonable. me, it’s going vaccine + 2 weeks, assuming get one, one day. really. Yes, it’s starting poorer towns, poorer people priority. uncle lives Doctor Arroyo, small town state, Nuevo León, spouse vaccinated today, aren’t poor hard federal government, electoral intentions there. electoral intentions vaccination lie produced opposition leaders. disagree view scientific method means admittance proved wrong

Then idea scientific method. Scientific Method require every scientist willing admit proven wrong, Scientific Method requires every scientist try prove wrong. That's scientific method words: form hypothesis, devise experiment could falsify hypothesis, see happens. 

Your example eggs precisely point: still debate studies done eggs scientists sure admit findings scientists cast doubt own. science, science actively murdering scientists findings may critical think 60s, US Gov time really cared science behind going moon

You glossed purges murders. fact Nazis cared rockets make pro-science, point. sure, alone make anti-science. makes anti-science everything else beyond caring outcomes: purges murders scientists. Similarly, fact US spent billions go moon make pro-science. *on own* make US anti-science either. none then. Keep opinions message board that’s 99% opinions? MENSA member? People say you’re vaccinated get sick mild, keep seeing younger people mild symptoms lung scarring, heart problems, etc. expected vaccines prevent long Covid, acting like mild cases big deal? Fauci lot guidelines safe reopening. states spend money implement them, closures them, teachers. get that, please remember young teachers high risk. lot may think. might see someone refusing, may life death them. 

I autoimmune disease doctors advised quit went face face. course can’t, bills. vaccine offered us, got mine. lot older teachers sneer, even though every one wanted one got it. didn’t even know condition made feel like shit. aware you’re calling out. alwayshasbeen.jpg worthless

That’s true, Parson excellent dirt farmer! could rain tomorrow I'll wear raincoat

the pandemic could get worse, i'll make sure keep wearing mask properly &amp; distancing people outside household

no need panic, take proper precautions Yep. have/had friend Covid, mid 30s, lied smoker could get vaccine. Selfish asshole. super unreasonable assumption 20% rather representative entire population. Although clearly bias selection data, might really lead different data.

If anything, I'd expect unwilling cooperate contact tracing shame many social contacts. That'd probably make even likely contacted virus social gathering. suck mot full data though. 3.7% reinfection rate sounds rare me? saying consistent though. 



I went looked subreddit. First thing would note 800 people subreddit, average like 15 posts week. That's REMARKABLY small sample draw conclusions like ""People consistently reporting they’re nuh discomfort point can’t move"". think going lead people niche community post experience. high likelihood filtering people unique experience driving post there. Even that, quick spot check, people reporting mild symptoms uncontrollable discomfort reference.



But looking sparsely visited subreddit, could also look actual data millions people vaccinated, tell potential horrible adverse reactions small.



No one ""supressing seems common scenarios"" stretch. worst case scenarios list ""common"" definition word. Reporting upfront potential side effects occur long last. 



Having anxiety side effects vaccine totally normal. Even mild, still fun feel crappy. okay going online claiming things like ""being much discomfort can't move"" ""common scenario"". problem common sense **NOT** prevailing.

Many politicians would rather risk constituent lives votes, lobbyist cash. instead reacting actual proposals, invented strawman head made wild accusations fear mongering based it? right.

Hypochondria lying/exaggerating attention real common things yet reason rarely mentioned comes covid. Trump still president, basically impossible separate one’s opinion lockdowns one’s position general vs. R American political duopoly. Opposition lockdowns seen vote confidence Trump Fauci, Cuomo, symbols anti-Trump resistance.

Now factor longer exists, many people would never allowed agree Trump anything starting form independent opinions lockdown policy.

This effect obviously mostly present US, also probably lesser extent countries Anglo cultural sphere tend closely follow US politics, like UK especially Canada. Yeah crazy. People go crazy. whole subreddit science scientific discussion try make scientific argument ""full yolo mode everything fine dissappear magically"" get emotional shitstorm like crazy haha.  


I even convinced escape mutations happen. Time tell said plenty times realistic possibility quoted data experts suggests.

But yeah post anything think go back less toxic scientific communities. :D

Time tell. 10 downvotes comment around 70-80% quotes recent scientific data. 
Ridiculous. :D pathogen carriers (not vaccines updated definition) side effects. also controlling workers. live fear losing employer based insurance, far less likely fight employers. employs lot experts disease fighting foundation runs. lol teachers NEVER group essential workers. 

I kid literally spit last week. We’re essential unless people need childcare. pandemic 90% mortality rate, would feel same? “right” choose risk level people (who you’re potentially spreading to) forced tolerate? Mostly thinly-veiled anti-vax rant, objectively even logically sound ""argument"" favor opening Yes doubt many guys 30 went bald filling hospitals up, track data who's hospitalized.

As get older, male pattern baldness common, stand reason since people filling hospitals older could pattern due age rather baldness itself? know extra week two affect efficacy?   wag? (wild ass guess) SWAG (Scientific Wild Ass Guess).  Using protocol gets 95%.  Delay weeks gets ???? yes I'm lucky condo Isla Mujeres mom aunt vaccine so. I'll careful, I'm going enjoy beach!! thanks ripping apart lol. That’s ironic rather hypocritical Probably.

Don’t get wrong- work healthcare. way, shape form think Covid fake overblown.

I think Internet message boards tend attract certain portion population want attention. don’t think Covid either. tested positive though. fucking nut?

sounds like great idea, let's mutate spreads everyone, idiots. real covid super spreaders friends made along way nearly infectious BUT...

1. new variants, kids spread affected more.
2. ignore need ventilation sorry state school maintenance
3. actual data communities ask questions.
4. Kids teachers died die. Without contact tracing, can't say definitively one way other.
5. teacher unions speaking health safety workers, failing, right teacher unions. can't fall teachers solve society's problems. Give fucking break.
6. N times less infections, put 30 room hours, math work out.

I worked schools last spring. tutor Title school used work get paid better tutor rich kids fewer hours ever spent teaching. Far students saying better learning glad part bullying/social scene. say hard seeing friends miss school, also want hurt families get sick. look survey data Chicago, white families majority wanting send kids  would rather get flu every year able see friends family’s attend concerts sporting events dine indoors visit office *communicating seeing faces others*. I’m going spend 4 months every year hiding face avoiding face face contact strangers. 

I’ll take risk, drive increased risk elders pass away flu day, mandated mask wearing. Less 1 per 100k insane. feel even year pandemic over, seems bound happen would number greater 1 per 100k due crazy fluke.

Literally worked flu two years row retail pharmacy get time get dr note, one would pick shifts. food service often wonder many people got sick, immunocompromised asthmatic really good me, either. Paid leave necessary also need empower workers able demand time sick. dont understand people leaving asymptomatic people this. well people got sick, showed symptoms either get tested. family 5 people good friends, went Disney Nov every single one symptoms, plus dad ended hospital TWICE. MUST people like early get tested. “Fantastical thinking” less already accomplished Australia, New Zealand, Singapore... whole world ignorant Americans. appreciate lengthy response, apologize snark. latched onto incorrect use specific jargon, misapplied, making sound like regurgitating information Facebook Youtube medical experts... I'll try respectfully reply main points/questions. 
 
1. Cell's response adenovirus well studied. first article PubMed adenovirus title 1956! (&amp; first isolated human adenoids 1953). common viruses &amp; generally innocuous. immune system well equipped recognize clear adenovirus. concern booster shots adenoviral vector based vaccines comes -- first shot induce immune system recognize vector cargo -- second shot, immune system could recognize vector clear rapidly also activates memory cells recognize cargo. case J&amp;J vaccine, dose selected overcome (""dose through"") possibility. 
 
2. Adenoviruses show tissue tropism -- preferentially infect specific cell types. lab, liver seems easiest transduce, different serotype adenovirus slightly different tissue tropism. lab animals, biggest challenge long term experiments lifespan animal, endogenous immune response vector. Usually lab, adenovirus studies couple weeks (this include pre-clinical vaccine studies looking ""dosing through"" immune response vector). concern short lifespan lab animals adenovirii studied mitigated fact nearly hundred adenoviruses identified &amp; well studied cause common cold. Unless immunocompromised, rarely cause severe illness. Pink eye, tonsillitis, ear infections, diarrhea caused adenovirus infection (i.e. replicating proficient either immune naive immunocompromised individuals). dug literature this, would shocked dozens medical case reports, population studies longitudinal studies confirmed infected adenoviruses last 70 odd years. concern adenoviral-based vaccines directed cargo, purity production, adjuvants (though get started adjuvants...).  
 
3. spike protein ends outside cell, immune system recognize it. immunologist, studied -- claim expert. understanding spike protein would presented via MHC complex same/similar route phagocytosed foreign material would also presented. entirely sure/convinced injection site (skeletal muscle) primary source produced spike protein. Injection muscle usually PK -- provides slower release systemic circulation, duration exposure longer. Also production local inflammation muscle (chemotaxis) beneficial vaccines. Also, cell turnover occurs time, even via MHC presentation, lysed cell contents containing spike protein would also permit visible immune system. degree something chopped impact tertiary structure &amp; could impact immune response it. would guess spike either stable, resistant proteolysis hydrophilic, would increase antigenicity varying degrees (again, expert here).
 
4. AZ J&amp;J transduce cells make host produce spike protein. couple companies presenting spike protein viral capsid (I want say CanSino? I'd look up). advantage using replication deficient adenovirus produce antigen amplify production &amp; thus increase immune response proportionally. Expressing spike part capsid makes sufficient recombinant viral particles need produced vitro injected; however virus need enter cell &amp; inactivated unable infect cells (potentially making safer). Using host make antigen makes much efficient, need produce much virus generate immune response. 
 
5. miRNA transit nucleus. lab others demonstrated this. Adenovirus deliver DNA nucleus -- sure would call ""nuclear breach"" -- sounds ominous, actually intended. DNA introduced cells mechanism, question whether integrate host genome homologous recombination. Adenovirus integrate (if did, transduce heterologous cDNA, would expressed lifetime cell/organism). contrast, AAV (adeno-associated virus) integrate, use lab want express something vivo longer 2 weeks. necessarily conclusively state mRNA based vaccines ""breach nucleus"" -- seen data shows limited cytoplasm; would guess cell, get nucleus unless specific targeting sequences dictate nuclear exclusion (consensus sequences miRNAs encode tissue specificity subcellular localization emerging field). 
 
6. final point -- yes oncogenes oncogenic insertion definitely concerning children. would occur adenoviral DNA integrated host genome, specifically site tumor repressor (e.g. p53). Adenovirus well studied &amp; integrate. immune system recognizes quite well, detriment effectiveness. far unknown unknowns, beg differ -- know far less mRNA based vaccines adenoviral based vaccines point. pro-vax scientist, hesitation taking either turn (I Phase IB PA), feel confident long term safety profile adenoviral based vaccines based historical use (J&amp;J also tested zika, sars ebola vaccines using platform) emerging field mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines clearly future due reduced production time, ease altering cargo adapt variants, apparent potent efficacy; however, long term human data using platform, unknown...

In winter, people may room heated via electric baseboards hot water radiators. Atlantic said today: ""The upshot simple: Even rise new variants slows decline cases, unlikely lead sharp rise mortality hospitalizations. Although pandemic isn’t over, perhaps reached beginning end COVID-19 exponential, existential, mortal threat health-care system senior population."" care bad ozone toxic chlorine inhaled. address, baselessly claimed would better economy. explanation tho know expect people say things make sense?

That's pretty rare feeling days keep seeing lot comments can't make mandatory. said, future, right though vaccine given Emergency Use Authorization forcing servicemembers take vaccine. soon fully approved bet it'll mandatory. 

&amp;#x200B;

While yes members military skeptic vaccine many, many ready willing take vaccine soon available tp them.

Source: military Prisons closed boxes. People mill sorts reasons: lawyers, police, suppliers, repairmen, guards, family, etc. live state teachers allowed form unions, makes pretty powerless. come close quitting haven’t 1. would mean upheaval students 2. Health insurance. I’m definitely considering options next year school treated us. it’s “a teachers” worried. staff survey, 85% staff reported feeling unsafe. ought major red flag everyone board community safety measures inadequate. employed way through. I’ve paid bills. 

Good you. lot people haven’t permanently lost jobs. How’s weather high horse? proposing every time parents get ill future, kids get 2 weeks school? Don’t like that.

They gave statistic symptoms 57% people surveyed said bed-ridden least one day. You’re acting like i’m saying countless people dying getting bell’s palsy it. sudden idea humans remain sterile environments get sick? Pathogenic illnesses NEVER go away, try prevent humans infected serve weaken immune system?

Student's health RARELY risk, think saying rarely still understatement. say disagreed economic assessment instead falsely claiming addressing economy all? ^*yeah* Reinstate Captain Crozier! theory mRNA vaccines predicted easier, faster, safer traditional viral vector vaccines. don’t think anyone predicted would much effective well. don’t blame people waiting evidence it’s little annoying see people close acting like poor lab rat pitied before, year later I’m suddenly vaccine line-jumper I’m regular young guy. Illinois here. hear ya!!! governor mayor think eradication solution. near fully open use published phase opening plan. far got “maybe Cubs Sox 10% capacity point summer” waiting somebody made America, surprised took scrolling 3 comments. 

I wonder replies would’ve looked like US government this... imagine would circlejerking less people saying “yes seems necessary understand virus”. See: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. positive side people currently stuck inside cases could decrease upcoming weeks read it, economic recovery extreme lockdowns story baseless. summer, open matter things not. would losing months economically, creating mental, social, political mess behind... Can't access article, obviously encouraging. 

The bigger hurdle new cases per 100k. Counties need fewer 8 new cases per 100k move purple tier red tier. Right Sacramento County around 18 new cases per 100k. I'm hoping weeks get red tier. district never closed

Sorry hear :-( administration failed happy sister overcoming bs. solution students receiving worse education due lack technology, quiet space, teachers' technical ability/effort online send back school die infect others. tackle issues keep people safe improve aspects even pandemic. know data need peer reviewed valid, right? I'm saying wait. data fake, maybe one waking up, insisting UK Vs EU all. People kept comparing AZ Pfizer ones worldview, sadly. 

Ignoring evidence they're peer-reviewed almost lack ability make sense data 3 reviewers so. admitting limitations, really. 

A lot regulators eventually fine confusing data mentioned approved it. Pardon trust you. Let's reward people taking care themselves, please. Woah, looking death chart wild... \_something\_ going Georgia. Either hiding cases last months, deadly variant running wild, external factor work. Almost every single state cooling cases deaths, time frame Georgia deaths shot fast. I’ve lost count many people know unless trying tough, one know save one guy anything worse seems like cold. one guy said felt faitgued anything, barely sniffles symptoms, lose taste smell prolonged period - going 3 months last spoke him, said getting better back like 10%. couple months ago, text see now. learn it......sadly I've telling I'll get one 10 years now.

""Sure literally wee drive Dublin. We've borders like. Fun day trip. ""

I really oughta step gas. could unite island. 

I'm easy. team reached conclusion lab leak regarded extremely unlikely “on basis serious discussion diligent research,” added Liang Wannian, head expert Covid panel China’s National Health Commission.

So says WHO.  Gee. basis serious discussion diligent research.  questions! lot places winter storms. eliminate virus specific region can't eliminate worldwide, unless vaccinate every possible animal reservoir well, wildly impossible. even know went away sure half year. That's pretty scary man. Why? We’ve told summer want vaccine access one. It’s nice focus ends you. “We’ve declined review evidence concluded evidence.” Got spare Sputnik American, comrade? Whatever happened ""flattening curve?"" restrictions extremely harmful cost outweighs benefit, hell yes dropped. I'm guessing false positive. Also cause roommate sick I'm gonna buddy buddy him.. I'm staying far away possible making quarantine yeah one bathroom kitchen stuff. see people voluntarily wearing crowded areas future. see mandates outside clinical settings. says “teachers able teach safe place expand minds opportunities children” last time checked online classes providing exactly that. 

There lot teachers great job new situation work with. truly felt way hope see increase teacher’s pay funding education. see evidence people taking precautions.

It’s dead winter. Even normal year, time year kind social dead zone major holidays people gather dark cold people feel like leaving house. mention snow we’ve gotten year. agree. keep seeing state push vaccine estimate dates back canceling days clinics run. likely result. 
AZ tested vaccine vitro found lower antibody activity, said would probably work anyway, didn’t.

Not mention comorbidities way bigger risk factor age. do? Lmao close year since Wuhan eliminated outbreak.  Agreed. There’s little balance, fact whole pandemic turned political identity theatre driven even deeper intellectual wedge society, you’re either one side other. hopes us attacking future problems like logic nuance diminished.

Yes, that’s asking understand reasoning fellow parent trying look myself, still unvaccinated vulnerable, child. know every situation different everyone different views pandemic. simply curious everyone else thought given sub obviously keeps relevant news. Personally, don’t blame erring side caution. can’t take back health. point, called pandering teachers unions. important politicians. Yes, matters increases chances vaccine escape variant. There's going increased selective pressure due mass vaccination variants neutralized vaccine. There's somewhere around 55M US adults 65. Around 20M received 1st dose vaccine. US currently administering around 900k 1st dose vaccines day. majority currently going seniors. yeah, probably 20-25 days demand seniors starts drop current rate. 

Moderna Pfizer currently ramping output. Deliveries flat 9M/week while. Last week jumped \~11m, week they're 11m again, next week they're jumping 13.5m, expected keep increasing 20m/week April. That's valid point, make regulations guidelines based generalities. MUCH likely difficult healthy 65+ person 20 year old comorbidity. Yes, find counter examples, population wide measures. It’s measuring immune responsr (how
Many antibodies create) aka: immunogenicity. dont know exact level immunogenicity needed neutralize virus.

Basically saying, get less immunogenicity SA variant, level still good enough neutralize virus majority time. may high 95% time, still prove pretty effective. It’s hoarding using greater demand supply. can’t really compare family four buying 1,000 rolls toilet paper would take years get through.

Maybe responsibility country’s government secure vaccines, countries pass arms stick in. True, article Pfizer. Fair enough, right. caught moment frustration. got whole squad laughing saw guy /r/LosAngeles explaining wears respirator N95 routine like decontaminating clearing rubble roof Chernobyl. ""Crash rate intersection drops sharply, promising indicator removing traffic light."" lower life expectancy general due multiple factors, means they're underrepresented age brackets currently eligible vaccinated.

I think anyone seriously arguing required wear mask go grocery shopping 2023. Ugh. mother’s teacher school caving return in-person classes soon despite area still overall high prevalence; it’s bit unsettling. would’ve given vaccine could’ve. Education optional US. 1st grader attend video conference instead. net benefit, right? read preachers first got pissed.... Teachers good. Correct. Vaccines alone won’t get us herd immunity combination vaccinated people people previously infected will. Even know stupid sound comment lol latching MSM stories without looking additional information.

I theologically conservative Reformed Christion bothers end. looks like coming Dispensational corner faith. see every newspaper headline final piece puzzle Jesus comes again.   point point education isn’t optional aren’t contradictory. simply don’t think teachers essential workers priority group, go age. 

Some schools open now, maybe could wait 50+ vaccinated they’re skittish, every 24 year old teacher vaccinate aren’t giving someone older hundreds times higher chance death. 

If want use hyperbole used people like wanted less restrictions, 24 year olds likely indirectly causing elderly die getting vaccine instead them. Actually yes, every comment I’ve ever made critical Trump quickly removed subreddit.

Your point well-taken I'm laughing that's standard zoom backdrop. Nothing article appears evidence ""coverup."" Anyone familiarity nation state's workings easily imagine well-founded reasons individual officials addressing remaining silent issue first week's emergence. fully understand people questions wanting clarification, cannot imagine scenario emergent, unidentified, novel virus arise accompanied clear courses action, informed decisions, second guessing possible. Invisible pathogens unknown properties sequenced studied cannot scientifically addressed except find, study, sequence them. start arguing correct incorrect responses lot ""unknowns"" ""possible misinformation"" Chinese government entirely rooted bad faith exploitation fact *no* government could known first weeks particular outbreak- hell, can't even seem figure weeks *were* first weeks. Thank you. Outside pandemic times, someone able work go school cold feeling greatest. rule calling sick always vomiting fever. Isolating important right germs getting sick aspect normal life eventually get back to. Unless snowstorms started month ago, that's it. death rate December way better March April.

I'm tempbanned CoronavirusUS days. Mods respond request tell post problem. Yeah. there’s evidence schools don’t cause mass outbreaks mandate vaccine safety requirement, don’t understand point employment.

Or system employment would people allowed ignore safety requirements still allowed keep jobs? Meanwhile schools already wide open place worst pandemic without vaccinations.

In AZ schools wide open literally global epicenter pandemic.

Teachers died. Considering fatality risk hundreds times higher elderly, exposure risk probably hundreds times lower, talking .02% vs 5.4% infection fatality ratios. knowledge, legal precedent mandating vaccines approved emergency use.

Even full authorization granted, difficult see widespread adopted given maze legal protections medical/religious exemptions mandated vaccines. like kind thinking. Everyone needs understand “the science” heavily influenced politics media. “Follow science” bullshit saying. Stop. 

Normalizing. 

Germophobia. Can’t read article bc paywall, Chicago’s Union used zero Covid stance negotiate actually wanted- every teacher vaccinated schools reopened. article says something different lemme know tho commend least countries behaving like idiots.

Good job them. least realise world never heal people wanna get salty :/ necessarily. fully expecting feel like crap second shot nothing crazy. Normal arm soreness mild fatigue.

Still stupid bullshit doesn’t work, huh? None Sweden's 21 counties deaths / 1M 400 Västerbotten smallest 460. Denmark whole right 399. Stockolm. capitalism lack worker protections. Showing sick work food related positions illegal according many city county health codes.

Most employers offer sick leave paid vacation though workers often can't afford work. Also Managers pressure sick folks attend. I’m straight depressed coronavirus, hate everything it! hate happened, hate people masks wherever go now, hate people making jokes flat talking it, hate sub, hate people pro mask taking seriously, hate able go New York City anymore, IHATE IT! can’t stand shit anymore, thing never end!

Nobody believes Chinese data. Nobody. completely objective, math: state-funded, non-transparent, shady. may write null symptoms ten, without fully independent trial statements cost nothing. sure, **Sinovac relatively good**. relatively good Chinese-made tools.
2. Protocol Sputnik published. nobody knows defined Covid-19 case. sure, **Sputnik relatively good**. Still clear good.
3. believe anecdotal reports Brazil Turkey Hungary. need independent trial made Western entity. May Sinovac excellent? loosing time? Jake Tapper suddenly pivoting super super concerned psychological effects online schooling kids feels like sign broader shift media mean, obvious. Like said, resist making snarky remark.

It remains seen vaccine manages mutations. Given that, understand it, mRNA given instructs body produce spike proteins immune system recognises builds antibodies (Though I'm still confused body would attack proteins creates itself, know enough topic), given - again, understand - spike protein mechanism virus connects cells, long spike protein change way body recognise anymore, theory much worry.

But again, we're getting flip-flop info every day, thing really know actually know little. And, naturally, preventing infection means preferable, far really go?

Like, cannot stress enough, really know whole lot lot stuff based assumptions modelling we've yet compare assumptions models real-life outcomes.

But valid question, questions need constantly asked get many viewpoints possible common consensus, looking one side may lead us want be. pretty safe stop wearing mask vaccinated. vaccine greatly reduces chance spreading virus: course still wear mask places required business government mandate. decimal half full? No, case fatality rate would theoretically close (provided overrun health system)... rate, static number. spam crap every day. nearly funny witty seem think. America locked month remained opened rest time. 

It’s hard believe deaths would ten times worse without month lock down.

ETA: further, 1/3 Americans covid. get 10x deaths triple infections without lockdown? seems like completely made number. I’d downvote twice could far schools open Europe US? lockdowns may different I'm sure they're really less. Guess depends specifically. trying get pregnant, playing stupid games? Ny friend nursing school told get vaccine wanted get pregnant within next year. prefer Simpsons line Hibbert: Well can't treat mental health, tell exactly many age live in. think vaccination kind auction. OK, problem.

Guess chances win EU Israel? US UAE?

Imagine, US EU win auction(this trivial behemoths). long wait Israel together UAE first vaccination?

Imagine life health dependent auction. imagine Canadian, vaccine literally stolen, shady country decided pay double price get it. low mean. 

P.S. FYI: we, EU, forget either shady countries shady firms. log off, spammer. Check posts  Ha. That’s fair. Plus Florida, guess. family recently said happy things back normal now. Meanwhile I’m soon fully vaccinated I’m sure I’m ready visit even then. already depression/anxiety, treated thankfully, nightmares forgetting mask public  said changed estimate based new studies. science works. change beliefs based evidence.

We've really failed country teach schools. No, listed bbc radio interview factory worker said exactly told you. Local papers reported “nearly asymptomatic” different actual factory worker said. happened Cornwall, I’m sure interview still exists somewhere. remember one kid actually fainting one time.

Ugh, I’ve fainted heat before. pleasant memory. 0/10, would recommend. lots free time watch movies tv series. 

I've spent time life working something better sitting around watching movies tv series. that's wanted would quit job years ago. Nothing without Oxford english version? Cuz restrictions work! Somewhat. I’m still terrified severe Covid severe flu, wasn’t around 1918 pretty uninvolved news swine flu, get shots don’t get similar reminder Covid booster shot would induce. hopefully won’t come seems like speeding vaccinations, although there’s still 100 countries haven’t gotten single vaccination yet. kids magic shield covid. get it. transmit it. MIRACLE Maybe ask parents instead?  like wait month get vaccinated? would rather catch flu every year miserable weeks live like November April. know OCD anxious lock hard enough, duh. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

mmkay? think it’s important blame lying also understanding lied. don’t think he’s GOAT anything think trying best given. Dealing Trump throughout whole thing probably didn’t really help situation. health insurance offering $0 copay therapy/psychiatry since last March, ended Jan 31st. guess pandemic need therapy anymore!

It helps, like.... feel like anxiety depression spending much money benefit gives me. Like still panic attacks anxiety, like therapy solved it. I'd like continue, lot money reason people putting promise things go back normal. People wear masks social distance forever Spanish flu around, they? No, went back normal got lives, much deadly serious Covid. fact Roaring 20's directly after. completely sure 10% also realistically possible.

By official numbers 80 million people tested positive covid recovered. number surely underestimated perhaps factor 10 more. easily add zero it.

This would mean close hundred millions people. Either ""long covid"" mean really mild, close imperceptible things, even provenly related covid number also overstated. Babysit me! said based changing estimate new studies. thing happened mask guidance. said best understanding time, changed statements match new evidence. people understand science works interpret lying. hell wrong 2 thirds?!? Ha! sources say export ban. AstraZeneca wanted deliver UK could export bans listed vaccines corona virus could come laboratory China. According study University Hamburg, many arguments favor laboratory accident virological institute Wuhan. medical examination 78 people? use “Steve” Starbucks, Wendy’s, Arby’s, etc. easy hear noise kitchen, easy spell. know trolling certainly say that.

 “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.” None fuckers stayed fucking house.

And saying ""oh, lockdown work"".

Fucking moron. first guess would god tier shitpost Yeah, there's study showed 8 weeks there's small proportion people persistent symptoms. Here's disagree people assume stay lockdown due potential people develop symptoms 12 weeks. sucks deal symptoms, since know subsidy covid covers 2-3 weeks.

But we're lockdown save lives, avoid complications small proportions population. elderly vaccinated, we'll open up. Pfizer vaccine found be:

* 93.7% effective symptomatic disease
* 93.3% effective hospitalization
* 93.9% effective severe critical disease
* 92.9% effective mortality
* 89.4% effective asymptomatic infection. However: authors clarify figure regarding effectiveness infection least certain, explaining vaccinated people less required isolate therefore less tested, research needed examine issue prevention asymptomatic infection.

The study compared unvaccinated people people 7 days past second dose. Hell ya! I’m unfortunately 103 years old sorry think folks sarcasm detectors grown rusty know, hear out, crackdowns employers push employees come work sick. solution easy—just say ""screw it"" put end lockdowns, distancing, mask-wearing. They're lot damage COVID ever would. rip UK invested research factory investment well vaccine proven work.

So US EU. Oh I’m 34, weird. hoping born 1918. wedding off!! think two factors:

1. Syringes different
2. Pfizer (and presumably others) sell *doses* litres vaccine.

So fulfill obligations, Pfizer state extract vaccine. process certain level uncertainty. account that, Pfizer fills enough vaccine practically guarantee five doses. someone improves extraction process (e.g., using specialized syringes, maybe even top 1% syringe) extract *more* safety margin.

That *not* mean vaccine generally wasted, though. everyone access handle auch syringes, mind you! Instead margins commonplace large logistical operations. fly plane, *will* carry excess fuel (maybe enough circumstances, some). go cruise ship excess fresh water. on... never stated that. Private business ='s ask workers vaccinate lose job.

Eh I'm happy we've careful this. mild symptoms first thought allergies days. got tested surprised came back positive. strict seeing immunocompromised diabetic family much last year, likely would've passed even knew it. “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.” I’m unless job paying pretty stacks cash government whoever so. ha ha anxious depressed pandemic too! Agree although it’s worth Moderna testing updated one partnership NIH Ooo, information? Lol real hate people world supposed do? let particular mutation spread world kill even people? South America Africa sealed months ago, wait infection go wait stronger vaccines\\treatments 2022. let stupid tourists come trouble areas bring back even worse COVIDs. understand help coming right now, that's world live now. patent manufacturing systems Western countries constrain availability vaccine globally.

You mean development, investment manufacturing western countries enable availability vaccines globally.

The countries paid infrastructure developing vaccines, invested research development finally paid vaccines.

Thanks efforts, vaccines available worldwide (well even now) slight security populations stake not

The security population **even more** stake vaccinate first. west bankroll manufacture vaccines 3rd world like always done throughout history precisely global threat. getting house order comes spread poorer countries going accelerate vaccine escape

The virus differentiate poor countries rich, unvaccinated vaccine escape happen. since amount vaccines set finite baring vaccine escape. west secretly hoarding unused thousands dead overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure every 2-5 years recipe economic social disaster.

So instead first taking care sick, suggesting compound disaster west shipping vaccines abroad first? Makes zero sense. virus care whether unvaccinated US Congo, chance escape mutation same. Vaccinating person Germany exactly much good stall virus escape. No, trapped home causes it. matter whether trapped home government said so, trapped home independently realized best option. Either way get effects. Fauci said expects normality Christmas (previously said fall).

Biden said townhall expect normality “may Christmas”

A lot need get head sand. going another 10 months sorry say live United States.

This idea you’ll able maskless summer delusional you’re actually following news government. also know extremely likely vaccines given US way effective one shot originally thought. theoretically protected people already. anxiety absolutely caused lockdowns restrictions. caused diffusion deadly respiratory disease. surely long period restrictions make worse, even agree tolerate better lot people. root it. too. We’re together family AZ wrong company job. hardly vaccine experience. 

The list failing much longer enumerated. shear dishonesty company's communication staggering. anxiety presents lot doomthoughts ifs (ie. lose job, get accident, sun explodes). yet due Covid anxiety bad right now, intrusive thoughts already reality brain nothing else really anymore. Seconded! He’s worst supposed come LA conference April 2020, Covid hit. I'm sad it, really looking forward checking city long list places going hit stuff face delicious food. uk tried float idea. dismissed age discrimination.

(for rest, disagree). say ""sure"", sometimes that's get. would like trumpets heavens acknowledge right, far nothing. flights places, citizens allowed others, sometimes plane tickets cost dozens thousands dollars instead 1k 2k, countries require pricey quarantine, etc. great news, keep mind number includes first second shots.

The REAL stat need paying attention many people received first shot thus least level protection. number projected pass 41.025 million mark today, mean 1 8 people jabbed. opinion put question hopes someone would answer.

That's need rude. beacuse lockdowns media mass hysteria.

A virus that, doesnt cause depression people, gives infection. time seal African continent wait virus run course, cause good vaccines like Modera Oxford work, doubt dodgy shit like Chinese Russia work, someone lives continent.

yeah real powerful /r/asarealafrican energy I'm sure beyond I've read, I'm even sure execution technique challenging widespread implementation (I'm making sense they're saying), bet everyone's figuring now. 

Remember - everyone seems ordering ""doses"" ""vials"" - Moderna/J&amp;J/AZ get multiple doses/vial, they're going quickly figure everything it. Unions stated teachers return schools even vaccinations. Whats point? First gives men ED, bald. like turns everyone middle age man. know.

But know 95% means right? don’t understand “experts” saying declining case counts nothing vaccines ...

You’re telling 18% population vaccinated unknown % that’s probably 5% natural immunity *nothing* vaccinations *all* masks? really really don’t buy that. 

Listen I’m disputing masks work - - change mask uptake US much difference November? people wore masks November wearing masks now, weren’t wearing masks November still wearing now. also desperately tried undermine AZ vaccine stop UK's rollout, (which thankfully work slightest, still 95% uptake) Europe population take AZ vaccine result. probably also attempt save face ""charitably"" giving away AZ supply they've undermined hard properly use.  epidemic started China. Everyone knows. It’s hard facts. UK already 800 old people trial I’m better years. It’s decrease social anxiety. Social interactions would fuck days. go forever without interact anyone outside safe people! It’s Valhalla. It’s ‘feeling safe’ protections school provide. Schools ‘safe’ criteria met.

Hope looking see contributing factor standards raised. would help long run cutting spread airborne disease China pledging lot vaccines lot different countries, really hope end arriving, unfortunately believe significant number Chinese vaccines arrived Africa far. I'm somewhat concerned might end empty promise. see lol bad Kind hard blame anyone one.

I'm sure teens college kids reddit find way. even tested four days, positive, symptoms 10 days test 14 days, still going positive even infectious. makes even sense get AZ vaccine wait others become available booster. Lol 3-6 months ago sort comment would downvoted oblivion! glad mood shifted Yo I’m graph wanted say. Yes. confirm. sure I'd exactly call depression anxiety feel like I'm definitely starting develop covid fatigue. I'm kind person requires constant night life happy, that's it. I'm getting worn politicians constantly flapping lips TV never knowing booze smokes simple pleasures banned enter hard lockdown again. I've needed find sort job pocket money online ever entire year looking job probably hopeless.

Maybe I'd feeling better lived actual functional country run intelligent, decent people steal much relief money possible handing arbitrary restrictions seem make things worse. is, I've spent last year life bunch fat, greedy, greasy idiots control life ever laughing way bank lambos. even allowed fucking cigarette, could think fatass president sitting mansion Cape Town smoking cigars drinking fine aged whiskey.

I'm saying must drop restrictions now. I'm saying last year felt like constantly asshole politician vote breathing back neck. can't wait go back ignoring living life fucking billionaire making monthly speeches calling us ""fellow South Africans"" telling us sacrifice greater good robbing us blind time. big head face Chinese KN95's also hurt ears got ""ear saver"". Ear Saver connects elastic bands mask go behind ears takes pressure ears. also makes mask little snug fits better.

I also notice pair KN95 mask cloth mask, fit much much better. use dogs lol. They're 90% accurate. think misunderstood me, agreeing adding sentiment. Making single dose instead 2 doses would allow vaccinate people much faster already 90% effective single dose 2e dose 95% tiny 5% matter, heck does'nt immune system slowly rampup anyway time ? Well depends thr UK currently using mixture AZ Pfizer(according ti Scotland vaccine tracker majority pfizer). They'll also using vaccines well get approved like Novavax, moderna J&amp;J. Also know yet AZ still prevents severe symptoms/hospitlisations. probably work mild moderate symptoms may still prevent hospitlisations good enough booster shots come. 

The UK probably open borders select countries summer maybe. live CA, SF exact. going pure intuition, would say another 18 months complete normality, unfortunately. talking ZZ Top beards mutton chops? think much issue it. Kind late wonder since whole thing almost lol. Europe? send? hates Europeans much? Yea obviously want prioritize vulnerable one make concerted effort try cut line know highest tisk. god amount ""why X getting vaccinated Y?"" shit read ridiculous. matter is, another vaccinated person another step closer ending shit all. limited supply can't afford doses go waste. thing worse vaccinating vulnerable letting shots go waste someone supposely deserves you. shot arm, even healthiest low-risk young adult imagine, still infinitely valuable shot trash. 

I'm sitting patiently waiting turn like age someone calls tomorrow says dose I'm thinking twice it. Get rid DeSantitize already.... think talking current rate vaccinating. It’s mess far staying current rate would mean improvements efficiency increases available vaccine doses occurred. significant factor might kept number down. trial solely healthcare workers (a group that's 20× overrepresented covid cases). General public might much higher efficacy due much much lower exposure levels.

I'm pretty sure trials required compare cases control group. Another detail, symptomatic cases, cases (PCR positive) far understood. methodology suitable lower efficacy results one reason.

Oh, case Sinovac effective enough herd immunity, really good. wish vaccine manufacturers would test asymptomatics, really important herd 83.70% cases requiring medical treatment

Damn, 12.3% requiring medical treatment getting vaccinated still pretty damn high. deliver 60%

Which makes shortfall 40%. Therefore original comment tried blame entire shortfall UK bullshit.

I'm done conversation. public policy set people themselves. us judge. Kiwis Aussies want stringent restrictions stomp virus they're free follow kinds mandates. Luckily, rollout vaccine they're looking couple yrs economic isolationism. they're running multiple years current account surpluses economies handle short-term hiccup without inflationary pressures. would want mandate masks flu? really want everyone wear mask times 6 months year (Sep thru March flu season) every year indefinitely? Nice ruse. Blame effects failing health care system pandemic. convenient.  don’t know cutoff point ie many antibodies needed offer protection. Maybe two third reduction still line. don’t know yet. 24.5 million number basically everything goes right number.  It’s Pfizer Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, NovaVax able meet commitments (and later three approved Health Canada timely manner).  Also, administration would really ramp up.  

14.5 million 24.5 million Pfizer Moderna concrete number. We’ll end likely somewhere middle 14.5 million 24.5 million June 31, guess reasonable aim 17-18 miliion vaccinated 50% eligible people let alone eligible people want one. Covid Truther?? studies things. That's anyone does. $3.75 one selling small batches business model selling large batches.

USA USA USA disagree. Life got dramatically easier lockdown, since constantly commute much place place, prepare leaving home. also means always nice powerful computer setup instead tiny phone. addition, many things improved 2020 unrelated COVID, like graduating, discovering VRChat, 2021, able find job make money whenever want first time: Doordash. preferred staying inside long COVID-19, much COVID almost excuse avoid going outside. depressed due COVID all. would even say opposite effect, since comfortable happy inside. Excellent. 50% promising. not? bit confused, bro. work new variant may reduce efficiency. still work might give original 95% efficiency. reduced efficiency major deal Mandate moral compunction. Regardless whether mandated, need public shaming campaigns around mask-wearing. send unvaccinated covid quarantine camps building wilderness. way STAY SAFE!! finish vaccinating I'm sure get sent Africa.  Unfortunately that's nurse contact England can't confidently speak rest homes/hospitals etc 8 people infected home size give warm fuzzies all. would love believe information we're given length time people died etc, I'm hesitant. mom kept even slight fever sniffles...it's actually kinda terrifying look back know kids sent like business usual back 90s, friends could puke class sent home, school got parents constantly keeping yet proving maybe mom something 🤦🏻‍♀️ Coming horrible break up, broke, almost homeless. Covid happened. managed almost recover financially, holy fuck Im lonely. would government force wear mask don’t feel well? define feeling sick? know someone sick doesn’t allergies? would law enforcement know? Would send someone jail wearing mask sick?

Yes, norm, law. seems really US overpaying health care issues... color surprised. Also failed casino owner charge negotiations probably best position have. 

Also contrary you, actually hope best people important you. prefer everyone behave fairly fall nationalism. shit kills people long run.

By way, vulnerable members family already vaccinated BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine. vaccination program actually terrible. dumbest take ever. 

Don’t take vaccine that’s 100% effective stopping hospitalisations deaths (and wildly effective hoping vaccine start pandemic).

Instead, delay rollout, prolong lockdowns, wait different vaccine (that proven also weaker new variants). Yes, Trudeaus forgotten, bribing shady deals could change situation drastically. Yes. Bad boy, Trudeaus.

But Canada right know getting vaccine(prepaid). think? keep silence? That’s fallacy; implies pregnant women won’t get vaccine. false, pregnant healthcare workers, essential workers certain states, standby line receivers already taken vaccine. Taking vaccine mutually exclusive pregnant. decide you’re scared unknown side effects take vaccine pregnant, choice. However, CDC says found evidence vaccine detrimental pregnancy, choice remains personal choice, implied health necessity pregnant, absolutely employer accommodate that. quite frankly, people got killed country got completely turned over, zero sympathy left someone isn’t even pregnant yet wants take goddamn vaccine. Maybe I’d understanding someone already pregnant genuinely fear actual current unborn child, actual situation ridiculous. think say effective without actual clinical trials. far lab studies. Cannabis Indica, particularly something like Pink Kush, take right sleep, wings fabulous fuzzy pleasure. 

Honestly look medical cannabis use insomnia, strains (such Pink Kush) make user *very* tired. 

I insomnia, works least. damned gf/gf bf/bf better? What's secret? thriving? must know.

(Went public elementary school parents homeschooled would middle school years grade school clearly elementary school working out. graduated alternative high school area bit lax attendance last school year) would say success, especially since US leading world vaccine distribution since Day 1. think it’s fairly likely. believe initial statement wrong. 14 days 92%, days 1 14 51% ( ugly CI). 80% average whole month (days 1 28). need vaccine everyone 65 medical condition first. essential workers, public defenders, police get line behind teachers. mean imply anything sort. think read way due bias. 

I've many countries tell certain diverse array cultures East Southeast Asia, mention Australia New Zealand. way lump one culture tried do. Furthermore, differences people countries span range human personalities types whatever want call it--same US anywhere else. similarities cultures outweigh differences orders magnitude.

I think region world ready pandemic. make sense. vast majority deaths covid 65 even know vaccinated people can't spread virus others. Prioritize age we'll vaccinate elderly back normal summer. Instead trying curry favor teachers unions reopen schools faster. appreciate perspective. admit initial post poorly worded. clearer. I’m sure would still opposing view points, that’s fine. agree you. Sounds like excuses. thought cross mind. that's it, it'll resolve soon enough. Unless something goes wrong, see reason events held throughout US Q4 2021. agree. sad actually, lot like Oxford/AZ vaccine philosophy. Developed university, selling without profit, sharing patent. 
How hell go PR mess we're today. Socialists hate rich rich. That's like saying thank Foxconn new iPhone 12 baldness caused genetic factors, unrelated poor health. Yet another reason say FUCK DESANTIS expert ever really recommend healthy eating exercise either

🤷🏻‍♀️ Glad know Germany many idiots lol know you’re going through. haven’t seen wife since Feb 2020. Yes, that’s said. Kudos efforts Researchers Oxford, kudos people actually participated trial kudos people manufactured vaccines large scale 1st door

The contract EU signed day earlier one UK. According logic, EU receive entire vaccine produced UK US invested far per capita EU

The UK small country. Expecting get deal European Union, one top economic powers world much larger customer little naive honest. penny pinching, simply markets work. 

The EU also funded development Oxford  Look lockdowns closely. lock small areas community transfer detected. locking entire country.

They vaccines widely available there.

I would definitely take 90% completely normal vs. 100% partial lockdown. space lasers sedition us bit preoccupied gf can't smell farts relationship never stronger 33% depressed covid, many depressed lives suck right? mean, I’m super depressed, covid nothing it. I’m guy! Lol glad admit attacking woman. Probably makes feel superior shows world little are. person choice body. Deal it. question is, evaluated justified point without full trial? 

The data first trial *seem* indicate effective, enough data completely rethink way vaccinating?

The problem seems speculation built 2 vaccinated trial participants infected period beginning 2 weeks first dose second dose. 

I would love us able move one dose, seems like limited amount data make major decision.

My understanding second dose meant confer long-term protection, hard evaluate one dose since don’t clinical data anyone got one dose. Life expectancy US hit highest 2014 according google stagnant, even slightly decreasing. really gotta cut back soda fast food start active. Oh also, getting universal healthcare would helpful too. Everyone always talks J&amp;J vaccine ""game-changer"" needs one dose others need two, J&amp;J vaccine one tested one dose.

I think tested vaccines one dose, get similar results J&amp;J them. first shots second shots vaccine contain solution? i.e. shots identical? since December. running miles sun came every day, I'm breath walk across house. awful, docs I've seen really know beyond testing heart lung function make sure I'm mortal danger. doctor literally said ""I know treat this."" ""pre-complaining"". think Guterres talking about? Americans took whole box masks locked first class door. 

Poor nations need don’t tech US has. Americans need want go concerts. Festivals Europe, California, Northeastern US? Probably not.

They've merely adopted depression; many us born it, molded it.

But seriously, newbies feelings, tons resources help many forms. Getting help strength, weakness. Stay safe. Dr. Scott Atlas says hi. People “banned” acting responsibly Florida? look Sinovac trial effectiveness jumped 78% 50% looked mild cases like moderna Pfizer. that's still quite bit lower 94%. However, consider Sinovac involved high exposure Healthcare professionals Brazil trial opposed general population trial like moderna pfizer.

*The 78% calculated considering mild, moderate severe cases, officials said. mild cases among 13,000 volunteers included, figure 50.4% -- 167 infected placebo arm, 85 vaccine Palácios, medical director Butantan Institute, argued lower efficacy rate evidence Sinovac’s Brazil trials focused higher risk groups Pfizer Moderna trials institute used stringent standards. “We added possible difficulties [to trials],” said.*


*The Butantan Institute said included six types cases results: asymptomatic, mild, mild, two levels moderate, severe. (The Brazilian authorities stressed public focus vaccine’s 100% efficacy protecting severe cases COVID-19.) Western vaccine makers generally included mild, moderate, severe categories, and companies like Pfizer are additional studies see vaccine prevent asymptomatic ""Experts"" indefinite unassailable power tell us live daily lives. That's called totalitarianism. data support comments all.

At least, 2021. could useful yearly shots future. No. literally risk hospitalization death already low. negligible impact transmission new variants I'd rather wait efficacious vaccine. Happy Birthday Macron's fake news anti-vax comments AZ vaccine, calling ""quasi-effective""

The data supports Macrons statement. Get propaganda back /r/ukpolitics good news recently? checking sub late. Anger (at liberals anyone wants stop COVID-19). Denial (that COVID-19 exists). Bargaining (with people want stop COVID-19, threatening undo efforts). Depression (free bonus everyone). acceptance, they'll never accept COVID-19 remotely threat made government enslave guns.

Those bleak trends. here's crazy idea, reform sick pay ill drag office infect everyone else Exactly. Stop blaming flu I'd less anxious people would wear fucking mask and/or wear mask properly. We're year shit show still see people walking around without mask public people wearing masks incorrectly. Yes same. zz style, maybe inch long beard. new thing life numbers still live. Thanks. I’m sure argument here.

The SA variant doesn’t seem played much role letter editor NEJM.  South African variant isn’t dominant everywhrrr.  fact, it’s dominant places. making policy decisions based SA variant, almost definitely don’t delay SA decrease immunogenicity know Pfizer trials, immunogenicity high enough 1 dose provide adequate protection regular strain/regular variants, don’t know that’s case (and probably not) SA variant. Almost 100k people 65-75 died Covid within last year. would probably it. Haha.

Yeah “We got business troubled America’s dependence foreign manufacturing wanted something it,” said Mr. Bielamowicz, whose masks sell $2.25 piece — cents made China."" lot people said sub?

There patterns seem like brigading r/badukpolitics r/europe. Actually functional depression. still get up, work, etc., every day feel hopeless depressed. Even means less protection? it? 37 days use year highly unlikely I'll able come even close using anything worthwhile, various degrees lockdown continuing several months.  EU pretty poorly compared Western countries.

Compared two western countries export vaccines like import lot. Yes, that's true.

If EU would use vaccines produce (theoretically could that) would lead. good thing, need make sure, vulnerable (old immune-compromised) people countries access vaccines. threat dying way higher them.

Also countries look us future, China Russia help rich western world looking themselves. Stuff like sticks create many negative effects future. Maybe stop COVID-19 Oh, Mr. Epidemiologist... understand says. that.  Yes Bingo True pandemic life made depression much worse. gym. outdoor activities (without putting family risk). 6 months old pandemic baby another source stress time, especially first months. 

Yeah, I’m still alive. job. family hasn’t caught covid. got things I’m thankful guess. thing is, never said anything strategy. literally said recruiting children unethical.

Right, understand. gap specifically asked hiring strategy (given unethicality hiring children) - completely avoided question, essentially responding “well, idk, now,” really non-answer. linked video commenting goes this...

As actual whit paper, link hand find date UK contract relevant.

The contract EU public. contract, find explicit notion conflicting contracts. contracts signed completely irrelevant. signation date relevant, would turn favor UK signed contract later UK - stated article. Doubtful, antidepressants don’t make much money. literally $10 month (about half common antidepressants Walmart’s $10 list), unsubsidized. They’re ancient, simple, generics generics.

When go drugstore sour patch kids make money depression pharma does, lol states like North Dakota, Iowa, Florida dropped restrictions? kids going school since beginning school year zero problems. Schools made safe kids teachers. There’s need condescension, since “everyone knows” posted, guess you’re arguing straw man. I’ll leave could take 10 days PTO call sick leave, really see point that. think give unlimited sick days, I'd like pay extra worker I'd need hire. deal 3 recessions pandemic, varying levels success. TX winter storm.  Take predictions 2-3 months advance large grain salt, clearly see every state US slowly relaxing restrictions (or states, already abandoning restrictions).

Things may go quickly would like certain states (sorry CA), think there's political appetite return lockdown barring total reversal current trajectories. Yeah unfortunately anecdotal evidence alone drive public policy. 

Source claims: Youre 100% right schools shouldnt childcare centers public turned public schools into. Im going school Im going vaccinated end story. provide childcare 13 - 19 y/o student dont send him/her school. studies shown transmission via surface contact basically happen all. Use gas pump, sanitize, gonna fine. Anything preventing viruses jumping person person stop spread communicable illness. Like people staying away one another. people obsessively sanitizing every surface might come contact with. even mask wearing. basically eliminating communicable part illness. Thank lost newest data Israel shown vaccine efficacy pretty much symptomatic disease deaths?

If would apply efficacy new strains, AZ prevent percent deaths.
Unfortunately, statistic that, trials enough infected people get robust numbers severe cases. absolutely plan get vaccinated soon possible, think everyone should; however, true person still spreads virus whether they're vaccinated not. really person who's impacted vaccinated person who's vaccinated. wrong that? UK Government invested research UK Manufactiuring plant well vaccine proved work.

well... actually much research EU head UK institute behind promising coronavirus vaccine candidate concerned replace European Union funding Brexit.  expected loss **largest funder**, European People would much easier time accepting lockdowns authorities could say something like lockdown end cases get *this hospitals *this percent* capacity wear masks *this percentage* adults get vaccine we'll lift restrictions

I assure I’m pro science, guess what, science points dangerous conditions be! unless you’ve observed every school US, back off. smart way go back, everyone way. cutting corners ignoring CDC guidelines. Introverts Introverts Every generation seems go lesson ""be skeptical government tells you.""

And 20 years another crisis sort new generation screaming everyone ""do government says"" rest us like ""hmm, let's think minute..""

And we'll told we're killing people blindly listening. repeat.   I'm glad kids excelling, unlikely norm relying exceptions make decisions. Introverts hoping actually stockpile PPE wait pandemic start planning it. Exactly. paying attention things don’t affect *healthy* *actually recommended mental health* (if help people though that’s considered affecting you) Replace ""mink"" currently farmed animal. continued prevalence needless animal agriculture poses existential threat human race. Sorry loss. Yeah compared lot places US, lockdowns small contained. That’s happened time. might disagree things gone (there always people disagree). lockdowns done sense humanity solidarity vulnerable, lack it.

Uk? know, lot. Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine produced mainly UK factories across Europe. can, need 20 shots every new variant. Let guess, they're ones invested resources developing vaccines? Yeah, articles attribute things virus attributed sudden onset totalitarian rule really starting annoy me. can, believe not, worried both.

There’s major rules here, could go see family friends even vacation eat restaurants. don’t, realize it’s basically job get people sick stay apartment. I’m also aware social isolation one reasons make side article sliding flaming wreckage person finish line. also realize don’t get put people risk benefit. producing them. Cue poster claiming hardly anybody died. Facts Lol. pushed shopping carts around parking lot college. always noticed carts corrals, could stay way minutes hours. one cart abandoned, within couple minutes twenty abandoned carts.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Facts Wow 1 3! home months leaving go shopping effecting me. What’s worse run tv look online many people aren’t part. It’s hard depressed.  Since March 2020 feels like life hit pause button anything good happening bad things get through. finally taking second order effects lockdowns seriously? Part thrilled part seething wanting lockdown everyone spent last year screaming selfish grandma killers. doses same. Probably got money first place. insurance ran land adjusters started palliative care....lawyer talk meaning ""we pay pull chord tomorrow"". Insurance companies suck soooo Soo much. One kid back high school got ultimate award perfect attendance 13 years K-12. Nevermind one largest sources mono flu outbreaks... u follow delusional sub, migh think every 25 year old locked cellar scared meeting anyone 12 months. therefore noone wait get vaccinated.
reality is, way skepticism towards vaccine portrayed here. im talkin anti-vaxers, answer vaccine like ""meh"".
this sub filled people socially handicapped circlejerk news fit beliefs. They’re trying direct anger people towards “first world countries”. Usually works though commend respect. 1/3rd already depressed anxious without covid. lengths people go potentially infect others amazing (ly idiotic). headline says ""used""...in past tense imply vaccines made extremely rare material ran could produce finite amount. feel like ignoring important factors:

1. Human rights issues tend focus minority groups. although they're entirely unacceptable, certainly source anxiety some, cause widespread type anxiety referencing. issues America facing effect huge sections population

2. surprised happy people countries looked ""third world"" Western countries. experience ""mo money, mo problems"" real thing. 

3. somebody unhappy mean unhappy. like rule number 1 dealing mental health, offer comparisons, conveys feel issue unimportant

4. Mental health diagnosis relatively new thing medical field. Many countries lag *well* behind area... particularly ones uninterested addressing and/or propagating human rights issues. 

I could go on, reading posts seem pretty dug in, I'll leave that. UK always secretive contracts/documents believes national security associated anything associated lives gets high security classification. That's experience working UK government contracts 10 years ago, doubt much changed. Yeah, got little certificate gave free small fries McDonald's. Woopty-di-fuckin-doo! Thanks! think second time it. Much mild first year ago. I'm feeling great already week, lucky guess. Read edit. Yeah that's exactly trying say Due lockdowns aka lockdown skeptics saying last year y’all called us selfish grandma killers like mental health crisis wasn’t also crisis.... parents argument school attendance winter months. getting constant sinus infections. Eventually got point pull doctor test allergies school blaming parents (smokers). stopped smoking house result, still issues. guess allergic sort cleaning agent recycled air winter months amplified issues it.

Now I'm school longer allergy breathing issues outside occasional stuffy nose days ragweed.

They wanted put remedial classes missed much school even though trouble keeping coursework sick home. Found guy eats caryons. can't exhale glued valve kids living family, care remaining humans kill off? GLHF YUP SOUNDS RIGHT  Completing tasks care someone else's level satisfaction. Yep, training worker bee. Sending sick child school often two working parents can’t afford miss work stay home lack caring. seriously think Putin accomplices give damn rest world thinking they’re “worse Hitler”? don’t think so. far they’re concerned rest world economic military adversary. Came say same! Hope enjoyed vacation. Assholes gonna asshole. Short-term? Legislation mandates every single employee given 80 hours per year paid leave.

Long-term? UBI. Gets sick school. told stay home sick. Gets truancy threats told keep kid home. 🙄 Jfc! it’s 98% reported cases. It’s estimated number asymptomatic cases might much larger previously thought might underestimating total number Covid infections large margin.

The actual numbers might 3 20 times larger. would bring fatality rate somewhere .1% .67%.

Developped nations likely reporting number cases, reporting fairly accurately number deaths poorer countries mostly likely underreporting everything. Even taking account, actual fatality rate likely well 2%. look smart. confirm. depressed virus.
We depressed, Isolation since 6 months least. cant work. cant eat out. cant meet new people. cant see people. cant play ball go gym. cant live like this...
Its measurements, end, damage billions people.. Also, bet majority WHO, UN budget came 10 nations, like biting hands feeds lol. Maybe depressed suffer Long COVID, indicates close achieving herd immunity. I’ve felt “depressed” “anxious” past (undiagnosed, I’ll keep quotations) coronavirus opposite impact me.

I really hate 98% worlds population. Oh Florida Man... ingenuity dumb things internet headlines truly limitless. anxiety control Covid. definitely worse past year. therapist says every client same. feel much better first vaccine shot though. There's light end tunnel! evil scale, Ill give Saddam Hussein. coordination make fact one machine? don’t understand. world. children. world make depressing place keep living. Possibly. places let valved masks (the site testing near example). I'm interested explaining hot glue situation everyone, especially since kid front desk might kick anyway. I'd prefer regular mask valved N95. got downvoted asking pertinent question. Reddit like field landmines. depends sees comment first. say people finding new jobs care virus. two coworkers left better jobs pandemic gone office, working home new job. job interviews zoom rather travel office in-person interview. 

Sorry hear situation though. would say decrease anxiety try stay away news cycle every day. Reading COVID news every day locked home definitely add stress anxiety life. We'll get soon, hang there! know that... people understand put ""sickness"" quotes? put quotes would know I'm talking exact virus... Obviously giving virus... giving something acts like virus antibodies thing... Hence quotes hence get sick second round cause giving protein whatever antibodies die actually work it. definitely anecdotal evidence. mention community spike go back school October. I’m teen know depression ha gotten worse lockdown. fell exercise habits everyday become mundane. don’t enjoy waking morning knowing day Yeah anthrax vaccine controversy entirely battalion's shot records mysteriously got lost couple times got shots without knowing were. Pretty sure got vaccinated anthrax, way know sure. school district ""safer school"" Yep. Shock value attention-grabbing headlines costs- even public health safety.

Have ever read Atlantic? sometimes (often) takes political slant find science pieces responsibly sourced. I'll take shot someone I'm taking shit anyone! think huge overkill. vaccinated? vaccinated person likely non contagious are, viral load minimum. watched godson sneeze back car seat, proceed smudge around jacket ""clean"" it. defence knew fucked said ""uh oh"" fact. Excuse me, export bans enforced private companies allowed manage contract obligations, yes, hoarding.

Apparently ""best reasonable efforts"" every contract, namely ones export bans place. good news?!?!?!? Ugh online thing irks bad. remember driving hour school hand paper flu. turning online. exceptions. wasn’t take chance. even visibly upset skipping class turning paper. I’d say depression anxiety stem Republican malfeasance incompetence, basically root hundreds thousands lives lost Covid. people trust experts! hecking class 1 drug... Smoke bad lungarinos! basically hitler /s Downside terms herd immunity, able immunize double population given production capabilities now. least they’re alive...? soon know. want talk possibility.
 begining pandemic, authors disclosed chance vaccination, pharmaceutical non-pharmaceutical interventions would pressure virus mutate faster (yeah, opposite experts says nowadays, transmission, mutations). authors described that, like virus, acumulation mutations leads extinction, ""they longer viable"". 
Check article Spike protein mutational landscape India: Could Muller's ratchet future game-changer covid-19?
There articles disclosing possibility. 
Is covid-19 mutations driving cliff? Lets wait see, next weeks tell us whats happening. one thing Im sure: global decrease isnt normal consider know virus. Vaccination lockdowns cant explain global drop new infections. need medical degree read graph? Quit appealing authority look data yourself. sad indictment people can't think critically more

Argue merits. saying data provided falsified? pulled source cited. 

It's gonna get pretty lonely team apocalypse soon. think hill want die on. probably good number place bets on. current pace 2500 day we'd get 40 days. However think vaccines started kick in, fatalities 80-90% concentrated 12-15% population likely vaccinated, think fatalities start slow fact already slowing down. think right 600k mark fatalities flatline... speak. Last time checked, ""can"" ""it may possible,"" ""can"" ""we know happens."" still case, new evidence indicate vaccinated people still transmit virus? That's wrote word quotes. Sorry thought obvious. ""sickness"" meant giving something similar covid body fight get sick cause especially second shot. Still credible link source Covid19 period.

Nice investigation. Fuck shit im dippin Expected, rushed get everyone vaccinated. guess adminster second dose 3-4 weeks guess it’s us 3 /s example Google blocking websites selling masks. Look yourself- easily find masks sale Google: manufacturing capability drug makers vaccines won’t let make it

We dedicated towards basic vaccinations get kid flu shot. much else. But, coming online within next year. Jokes them, I’m already bald! “Give money funnel poor regimes... promise it’ll vaccines” here! 10 dad left us nothing. Grew engineer salary stay home mom. boom! Mobile homes homeless shelters. Weird. Derrrr. Anything keep gears normalcy churning money away. Mega rich dont give fuck. shut fuvk get back work. WTF? Maybe explain got downvoted heavily valved comments, threatened (although jokingly).

My understanding valved N95 zero protection around you. That's many places allow wear in. post find Real N95, people defending valved N95s? Yeah, part doesn’t make sense anybway. 

Two extremely low IQ individuals. soon republican states drop restrictions Democrat states well restrictions would serve point. think article knows talking about. totally normal add room air intramuscular vial, otherwise never get medicine due vacuum. sorry struggling! definitely relate everything you’ve said, worrying killing people existing beating head wall parents’ decisions. thanks. I’ll take second dose time, thank you. would unethical mandate masks covid longer major threat. never masked flu, would wrong expect people present. thanks. I’ll take second dose time, thank you. yeah definitely wearing masks future cold/the flu. never really crossed mind seems like considerate thing even cold. Ive pretty good. Guess I’ve training life recent/reliable estimates amount *untraced* COVID countries seeing? know based serology/antibody testing various populations, sorts considerations false negatives, getting truly random samples people interacting regularly (outside grocery sore vs. outside office church) ... certainly *some* level untraced COVID.

Reason I'm asking - based US vaccination, plus people survived therefore (hopefully) immune naturally ... currently estimating 13% population potentially safe COVID, another 7% already first dose (so they're somewhat protected) presumably get 2nd dose next 2-3 weeks. that's potentially 20% population potentially safe COVID end month.

That's assuming 28m cases US ... obviously know realistic. real question is, what's multiplier? missing 10% cases? Half cases? Whatever figure may - bumps ""protected"" portion population even ... curious know better data last time looked summer. Hell UK study 18 percent people COVID symptoms actually isolate. Think that. hearing last year Sanders would never elected defending wild socialist dreams universal healthcare? Suggesting US help poor countries like suggesting empty wallet homeless person, it’s like suggesting tax shit Bezos Musks world make things fair everyone. concept reddit generally seems understand embrace. Starting think might selfishness understand would directly benefit. ""Miscommunication"" euphemism ""fuck up"" - use language. 

Don't get wrong - surprising manufacturers trouble. near-miracle Moderna Pfizer able manufacturer *mostly* schedule. ""miscommunication"" euphemism redirect responsibility. also reinforced shitty school policies. furious couple years back found threw pizza jump house party middle school day 3rd grade kids perfect attendance rest kids sit class missed day two sick (probably attributable asshats sent perfect attendance kids school fever, sore throat, etc. first place). They've also instituted no-excused-absences-without-a-doctors-note policy absolutely stupid. Parents need take kid public doctor every little fever stomachache. forget limit unexcused absences high, something like 5 days. kid flu couple viral infections blow quickness. yet are. Thats manage common cold flu. domestically produced vaccine giant unknown published data, little trials, credible information efficacy. 

The Indian propaganda machine trying make sound like India developing funding vaccines it’s producing vaccine developed someone else. insane (and anti scientific ) design one dosing option. even gave everyone dose amount. half doses, double doses. sixth grade science fair, would get F anyone would take medical advice Bill Gates beyond me. need on? cosmetic purposes? Lol known days now. maybe couple weeks.

A lot people bought FUD we'll delayed next year. good see media reporting updates. Hes unpopular post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Thank goodness moved USA least stress paying shiz Tell New Zealand , also effectively local transmission started vaccine program already. 

There two main reason Taiwan needs vaccine need fast: 

One, loca transmission, almost daily imported cases among citizens returning aboard, many many essential workers might come contact time. critically important Taiwan vaccinate essential worker soon ensure leaks quarantine program( leaks happened January resulted almost two dozen local cases one death) Taiwan actually vulnerable covid ( high population density , lots multi-generation household ways separate) policy aimed controlling ( industries/company could operate WFH model , lockdown would effectively kill economy ) , therefore needs vaccine ensure leaks would happen again.

Further line, Taiwan CDC indicated current boarder control / quarantine policy could end Taiwan high vaccine rate. quarantine policy huge blocker tiny island relying heavily international trade travel, earlier get enough vaccine everyone , earlier open country again. mine effiecent.
but exp may vary. 1 2 3 adults lie constantly coping mechanism. long take realistically get it? People depression often put facade go work, get bare minimum done, pretend fine front people, even meet friends seem perfectly happy. collect paycheck survive. auto pay bills setup, auto deposit, food services etc minimal effort survive fine depressed. depressed person damn good lier one would even know. Seriously bunch rookies That’s awesome! :) forget beginning pandemic , many models like IHME showed 0 deaths/cases june. making tons machines masks probably even ready made sense. Obviously looking would have. words 80% get it? Sick arseholes framing good news bad news. legitimately partied kick out. tons transfer students would love take place follow rules Sure, except larger supply literally help world get back normal
This doesn’t happen case iphones.
And India indigenously developed vaccine, stop throwing shade motive.
I’ve belittled efforts Oxford researchers/tax payers funded effort salty I'm sure number way higher. Many probably answer honestly fear. Hi he’s Covid truther jackass.  [http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/syringes330.jpg](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/syringes330.jpg) red part gets wasted.

Usually, problem medicines dilute/cheap. Low effort moderating that's lot fucking vaccines.

It's mere fraction 50 million vaccine shortfall.

To clear, i'm calling comment seemed blame entire 50% shortfall UK's supposed ""export ban"". first world thing ever. fair them, that's constitutional job. They're loyal opposition job oppose poke holes governments plans. Westminster system fundamentally antagonistic. complain Conservatives opposing government like complaining defense attorney opposing prosecution. Right, applaud countries like NZ ability suppress spread covid therefore saving citizens’ lives. worry long term implications slowly rolling vaccines (my understanding begin border workers), well reopening world. you’re correct, way people quarantine 2 weeks vacation future  No. Water bill gates conspiracy sell toilet paper Everybody is, flights Florida quadrupled compared time last year Texas Florida's first peak mid-July.

How seasonality explain early July ramped cases cases went late July?"
