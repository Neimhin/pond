Also, saying Chinese government (you know, ones still blocking investigators) blame? look data actual article, discernable trend data know could make conclusion.

* population density largest city: Bern 2,600/km2

Yes no. even virtual schools offering ‚Äúon-site supervision‚Äù students sitting gyms less 6 feet apart, day across grade levels. that‚Äôs somehow better open? many teachers required come onto campus. US using ours, get one what? course is, crazy anti maskers USA spreading like madmen are. country lost collective mind. missing anything. That's what's likely happen, outside California. Unvaccinated people still wear masks. fluent speakers serve preservers language teachers rest people. vaccine sort prize skill; help keep alive valuable cultural resource. decision made tribe long-term benefit tribe. (Also keep mind many most-fluent speakers likely quite old.)

I know aware *why* native speakers nearly every native tribe US, large part due deliberate US government efforts stamp native culture. Many tribes far fewer native speakers Cherokee do. Retirement communities Florida also often quite insular. live there, need go world *anything*. Understandable, reason ahead rest first world?

We don‚Äôt mRNA vaccine production capacity, none frontrunners country. candidate Phase 3 lot almost every country say bar few. seems like best way give certain groups first priority, like walk get even cuts front people's appointments, certain amount vaccine kept reserve, makes absolutely sense sit 15 million can't figure right. also get check up. people milder symptoms also heart lung damage without realizing it. consulting firm.

It removed dept health services AZ yesterday said they‚Äôve tested 133 samples past 5 (or maybe 6) weeks haven‚Äôt found yet. plan analyze 27 samples every week going forward. 

We 60k cases last 7 days. testing 27 samples two weeks worth cases, that‚Äôs 0.02%. They‚Äôll likely *never* find rate. worth, SF multiple curfews. Bars clubs never open pandemic. Australia allowed country. small outbreak Christmas, people went visit family interstate Xmas trapped state allowed return homes. Thousands them. woman forced miscarriage tree cops let cross state lines access medical care. could book trip visit parents interstate, can't afford get stuck policy suddenly change, sorry folk looks get see grandkids another year. lockdowns prevent lockdowns. think people's ability plan lives?

Sure, stay hotel like prisoner two weeks return overseas, cool normal! Australia tens thousands citizens stranded overseas can't even get back so.

How businesses? New outbreak... boom business shutdown overnight... sorry, stiff shit, lose. Next time choose better business idea. fuck going plan open business situation?

So no, people can't live plan normal lives situations.

But sure, measures saved lives! typical year fact. Thousands flu deaths prevented along covid deaths! We've also saved little annual car based carnage (the leading cause death Australian children).

If saving lives worth reactions moral, every year? could flu common cold. could ban driving end road deaths! Think lives could save happy would be! is, surface transmission rare covid. really paranoid, use disinfectant wipe it.

My story tad funny. think ever accepted dangerous situation me. got petechiae across body went clinic. tested said probably something wrong blood. nonchalant about. asked would okay go work. said sure, go hospital anything changes. worked server point. 

Well accidentally pinched arm tray. immediately turn blood blister bruised. got lucky coworker two weeks away graduating RN. told go hospital. ER tested found 5000 platelets time. admit hospital.

THE NEXT MORNING get call clinic panicking.

Clinic: ""You need go hospital right now! 4000 platelets. tell us ER going call ahead.""

Me: ""I already hospital. pinched arm developed huge blood blister bruise.""

Clinic: ... weird. Occupied overthrowing wrong people instead responsible mess... really ""who cares,"" what's fucking alternative? We've collectively decided people get whatever fuck want, enforce nothing, so...

We society already decided say ""who cares.""

* Pregnant women immunized want, encouraged high risk factors

No immunization:

* People recovering COVID
* Anyone previous allergic reaction vaccine ingredients
* Age &lt;16  I'm sure considering followers part party wow. I'm honestly impressed see actions 2020. Last checked Scotland part UK. used trend what's coming infection wise. also tool know many need attention type attention. also used know infections use vaccines accordingly. 

Off top head, I'm pretty sure endless uses info bro. pharmacist working one chains I'd like PSA.

Our industry already short staffed many chains many areas throughout country. Depending work may fill hundreds prescriptions, giving COVID shots immunizations people. 

Giving shots small task. screen safety appropriateness. run paperwork computer system. Getting vaccines ready take time, time away us able actual job. I'd say shot takes least 10-15 minutes unless clinic set up.

We enough time day give 40 shots fill every prescription.

Most us get take breaks even lunch, working 8-12 hr shifts. COVID shots billed end day likely lot overtime, potentially pay.

So point is, nice pharmacy. get hit hard, believe well reimbursed effort. 

I'm happy play part ending pandemic terrified months come. Says ignorant bigot. work compressed gas industry US tell company able keep demand, despite claiming otherwise. I‚Äôve working infectious disease doctor past months. many patients remains ventilators weeeeeks bodies give out, esp elderly. ICU full this. end recovering remaining vents trachs get discharged long term care facilities eventually pass away. case Turkey guy caught Covid developed severe ITP. wonder correlation. We're blatant deniers. simply see statistics blatant fear mongering, overreactions, poor planning. Add sick restrictions go. hard worry they're reporting ""super covid"" excuse keep restrictions going vaccine supposed end restrictions widely available. People would put forever. doubt. I've already read several people saying would happy keep wearing masks even even vaccine worked instantly 100% efficient, number infected would go much, 15% that's enough get R0&lt;1 people 60 vaccinated mortality expected go roughly much next month, still many deaths.

The vaccine either used get infection rate vaccinating enough people (but takes many doses) vaccinating everyone risk make deaths negligible (but can't force people get vaccinated). non-existent levels

You Seattle? got you. got (moderna) yesterday afternoon bit sore upper arm evening. Today, completely side effect free. Never got headache fatigue grew extra finger, unfortunately. I‚Äôm early 20s reference. California distributed half million doses 21 days. One million 10 days would mean 4.2x faster distribution. take melatonin (good dose people 3-5mg, check doctor first) night, hour bed. Give enough time least 7 hours sleep avoid tired next day. Melatonin good thing take, able to, antioxidant COVID causes ton oxidative stress body. Half doses go general pop 70 severe risk factors Might‚Äôve joke shit not, [there literally dude megaphone stating mass spreader event telling people Florida vaccinations anyone age 65+. dad appointment get next week. could test positive twice, EXTREMELY unlikely strong symptoms second time around That's went there. Plenty countries would put first plane back. Arizona hot summer one goes outside large chunks day. Arizona summers basically winter. can't eat outside 110 degrees. Also mobilize quickly try stamp outbreak. allows concentrate healthcare personnel next part country flare up.

As opposed US entire country basically awash cases region left sink swim own. EU faces issue, Israel paid almost double price per dose get many doses quickly 

Any evidence this? Or, anybody know Israel received many relation population size? Israeli companies. nations seem given access relatively equal per capita amount. Israel, 8 million population, received far total doses Canada, 35 million. No, sense government tried force shit restrictions people lack common sense pandemic. Act like ignorant bigot get rules placed like ignorant bigot. Thank you, we're occupied overthrowing government moment. Please check back days address whole mass death thing. Yes. Mostly due buying inton pfizer vaccine late. vaccines get approved hopefully better. in: sky blue, sometimes looks grey. 

(No duh here. probably came here.) That‚Äôs probably pcr test they‚Äôre still 100% accurate. That's right - Christmas NYE parties homes LAPD touch. Hence lockdown LA merely delayed inevitable. Doesn‚Äôt matter. reason postponing would allow vulnerable people get it, shortage vaccines. aren‚Äôt taking spots. CA didn‚Äôt institute lockdown recently, clear acted far late great insight regarding exponential growth, culmilative new case figures really reflect something else. simple exponential growth function would account things like summer surges mitigation efforts. Even better population growth models rely recurrent functions. Predator-Prey models example bad problem all. noice I'm phase 4 I'm getting summer, least. Extremely unlikely. effects get food compared drugs completely different scale (rare exceptions apply, case). like company, 10 people office could jobs home. Greedy company wants us thumb squeeze every last drop work us even business dead due lockdown  NOTHING speed catastrophically slow vaccination process Yes went extremely well Florida. 

Just take step back imagine, pandemic, making vaccine first come first serve. inviting thousands people congregate one area long periods time?! Jesus glad people like positions power lmao.  wish saved website put priority types diabetes, didn't. definitely hope right. One roommates already taken vaccine, he's contractor!!! office medical building, guess that's why. says available March. ‚òπ Indian think used '1 other' indigenous vaccine given emergency approval Oxford vaccine given complete approval, probably give covaxin complete approval data phase 3 trials comes Sorry joking. Yeah believe vaccine way harmful absolutely understand certain people would weary it. DeSatin problem experience whittled one line supposed take face value ignoring nuance. like, person immunocompromised? sure twice. person covid flu (or vice versa)? test positive, negative, postive again?

the reason people incredulous much data available shows get it, develop immunity. layperson saying twice absolutely information. hmmm hard become skeptical.

and coming someone coughing 3 months suffering chest pain last 7 months. get multiple times? no, knowledge COVID research would think i'm right assume caught second time approved yet. companies dont want liability forcing people take it. especially employees one 100k adverse side effects. would shitshow March oldies sick people jabbed  Interesting. Guess we‚Äôd see one broken age group know report clickbait fashion:

On 6 January 2021, US Capitol building assaulted aftermath disputed election, people died 9/11 attacks.

(Imagine telling someone exact sentence couple years ago...) enlisted pharmacies vaccinations general public, thousands them. people live within couple miles one.

Then need mass vaccination sites? storage needs? government much incompetent. trust cvs Michigan announced this. Starts Monday. governor gets lot hate think she‚Äôs done right thing time. handled lot better states. know exactly he/she would fine? virus affect ANYONE. calling him/her baby want safe nothing short disgusting.

how *you* grow first? right isn't. Distribution issue. sitting millions doses Thank you...I vote put charge creating phases vaccine! Lol 1 time, maybe 1/2 time Listened Intelligence podcast Economist Monday within Israel healthcare providers people one trying one terms vaccinate clients first (which definitely bad thing!). Also young adults go vaccination clinics end day they‚Äôre left young get vaccinated what‚Äôs left over. know small population great healthcare system still shows easy done done right amount gusto! reason American POCs wary vaccination US: experience. 


(Not saying believe news refusing it, though...) Type florida coronavirus google look chart. first big spike June July, April March. believe constitutional right citizens US travel freely states without hindrance restrictions. still wear mask? sister law, mother father law signed get vaccine month. high risk categories front line responders.

this rollout fucked. 

further, forced go mingle (thanks honey!) showing covid symptoms. know already immune! vaccinations going snails pace, states vaccines left receiving small shipment tomorrow. Moderna vaccine approved yesterday. yup...all going well Anyone 411 mRNA vaccines varied storage requirements RNA fragile? Huh wonder palestinians might trust Israels vaccine several regions United States French widely spoken Spanish. Also everyone lives LA, Spanish French gonna useful living North Dakota. Excuse us using words language also good ""exponential growth"" mean next month twice bad. /s maybe experiencing long haul symptoms. long haul symptoms took 3 months show True. lucky get 4 days. 4 days nightmare always thinking smell taste. I- 94 Michigan yep, immunocompromised risk multiple infections. healthy, immunity.

i would trust random person social media site faced multitude data exists shows reinfection rare EU lacks vaccine left right, production capacity wasted.

But mRNA vaccine stored standard kitchen freezer months. Delaying inevitable good thing. means time hospitals provide care. large pharmacies staff site prescribe treatment hopium. want coronavirus now. understand MUDI REJINE NOW! thats way it, meanwhile Europe still debating vaccinated first, places Germany stopped vaccinating due ""software error"" registration.

&amp;#x200B;

all doesnt matter, start picking people street vaccinating them, start already. 9 million veterans connected VA medical system 18 million total. put drinking water thats one way describe it.

Israel saves second shot every person vaccinated, going problem. people treating like magical cure solve covid tomorrow give everyone vaccines fast possible. rush get back normal instead making sure everyone get full 2 shots. reckless.  episode, discussion modifying dose schedule mRNA vaccines US good idea, evidence higher Ct values hospital admission associated higher mortality, dose-dependent response SARS-CoV-2 infection ferrets. fuck happening lag deaths reporting deaths scariest.  Similar Pfizer Biontech?

It's similar Biontech/Pfizer partnership Pfizer Bayer international network get respective vaccine approved marketed internationally. difference Pfizer helped set trials abroad CureVac already middle phase 3 trial entered partnership Bayer. Curevac already partnership Wacker Chemie producing vaccine. There's countries accurate giving numbers Mood.

Sincerely UK agree -- pretty sure we'll get point start approving vaccines distribution. *checks comment/post history*. Nah. I‚Äôm good. Yes. No. simple way get moron Matt Gaetz thrown pool hungry alligators something?

In words would take 3 working days vaccinate everyone 1 million people worked non-stop (the US 18 million health-care workers). start getting results first patients finish enrolling, jab time.

Dunno, say seems like confident move see. Meanwhile Germany we're barely vaccinating running out! German efficiency myth, people. concern affects younger people more, impacts hospitalisations.

See, current death rates assumption, working healthcare system try minimize contacts.

If that's case, both, number infected people death rate increase significantly. healthcare system capacity, sick people can't get treatment. virus spreads exponentially, might catch higher load pathogens (or even multiple loads virus). result even younger people getting really sick. 5% death rate already means 15m deaths US - five times much expect normal years. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The Trump administration, whether like not, federal response pandemic consequences thereof. much they'd like imagine Fauci take blame he's front camera every day, one else. monoclonal antibodies developed based antibodies people make infected. fact they‚Äôre produced artificially means nothing. Real leadership would ordered people stay place give shots holidays.

Yeah dont winters either. Sounds kind shitty tbh, dont know call home ‚Äúhard‚Äù. Hence asking actually suffering restless cooped describe one would usually call town?

A small community, stores, services, activities. leave want, particular reason to. 

It's like communities people coming going every day: workers, shopkeepers, staff, occasional resident host Disney. virus give ""catch up"" time... mutates becomes infectious.

We need go faster. Yes. Countries caught early inherent advantages managed make mistakes implementation manage control it. late basically good options disposal. agree response wasn‚Äôt early enough. early enough, don‚Äôt even need lock (for example Taiwan) success stories like NZ fuckup compared Taiwan late, lock fix it. truly gets roots, even lockdowns won‚Äôt fix it. severe, long, combination two, cause harm good (see Canada example)

I certain countries like Canada US lifted top measures, would even bigger disaster.

Sweden relied mainly voluntary compliance, although compliance much much lower Canada US terms masking social distancing (staying home), results significantly better overall:
Excess deaths causes:
USA: 16.83 pct
Canada: 9.36 pct
Sweden: 5.61 pct

My guess fewer serious unintended consequences rely voluntary measures. shows data too. US Canada, quite similar top approaches, although Canada dragged feet masks. significantly non-Covid excess deaths causes Covid deaths.

And countries, half excess risk dying year majority people non-Covid causes. (By much staggering factor Canada USA)

Sweden way around: far Covid deaths total excess deaths.

Fuck antivax shit. go get shot?  think mass rapid distribution ends pandemic faster

This really valid point right now.

We ending pandemic 17M vaccines. 3 months vaccines approved? Different story, getting 12M (CDC's count distributed, adminned) shots arms today instead next 2-3 weeks speed end pandemic. Nothing personal, discovered first. Amazing, thanks response, super helpful! would guess learn virus such, we‚Äôll able come much better treatments (perhaps COVID version Tamiflu something) we‚Äôll almost certainly continue develop efficacious better vaccines. Vaccine research won‚Äôt stop pandemic does, think we‚Äôll eventually end something better now, even pretty good solution. I've worried this, too. afraid around time start see earliest people get reinfected. Imagine happened New York City. Thankfully studies like looks like still antibodies immunity. I‚Äôm day 2 post vaccine shot 1 still feel like could tear bit. wife got first shot well today. weight lifted shoulders lpn stuck arm immense teared up. cannot wait 2nd dose knowing much better protected dumb fucks around could care less. Seriously? CVS FAR worst managed company worked (and I‚Äôve worked fair share). stupid shit corporate wants way like companies, can‚Äôt believe even business way. would healthcare workers choose get vaccine? anti-vaxxers really common, even medical fields? yeah, brief stint music/film industry left bad taste said never again. perfectly happy keeping hobby passion basically free therapy negative news articles generate clicks. they've since January. Literally anything mentioned make people feel fear find way article. Remember initial reports found might 3 months' worth immunity? disease discovered 4 months prior? stop nothing sensationalize re-shape context anything it'll increase ad revenue. need work flu shots next. current effectiveness extremely low. sense test still positive weeks symptoms resolve (still detecting virus initial infection.) True false positives really happen PCR tests, otherwise countries 0 covid cases. Ah thanks letting know reinfected ran fever 102-103.7 10 days. awful. Thats pretty smooth. braved alligators, mosquitos, florida men... ""hoax"" got em.... studies done antibody decay. one read people mild symptoms majority cases. Antibody numbers seemed drop around 50% 25 60 days. that, idea process would accelerate. People different study hospitalised thus likely higher viral load perhaps stronger immune response survive. study, appeared take 90 days minimum numbers go down. I‚Äôm sure why. Vaccinations happening every state I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs mess.

When get national leadership cares fighting virus, get organized.  speak Turkey, Brazil free country free press, Butantan Anvisa internationally respected institutions.

If want take vaccinne, fine right spread unfounded doubts. Honestly, transparent one get confirmed, places patient visited, also phone number photos close contact may wide spread.

It transparent actually respect basic privacy, instead hiding numbers. Power. Texan, here‚Äôs exactly feels like what‚Äôs happening: ___ __ ____ _____ __ _______ ___. it‚Äôs insignificant there‚Äôs even different strains. news report it?  hung lot nurses, dated few. were, average, bright knew things nursing. much likely buried Facebook disinformation bullshit, compared groups people hung with.

Does say nurses you?

KIDDING! KIDDING!

I actually agree, college bio classes full pre-med kids snorting drinking way school. ones generally brilliant pre-med. long think would take US federal government create online registration verifies individual points specific location specific time. Bidding process, build out, testing, etc. \~6 months - year would estimate. Also try figure consistently remind person show correct place correct time vaccine could expire. also figure update changes location schedules, closures, hiccups supply chain, etc. 

The problem majority first approach minority risk complications like older people less likely use internet. 20 million people without broadband. Without realizing basically saying young middle class white people get vaccine first even though statistically safest.

There lot problems rollout currently. lot. believe priority risk benefit. wish could sort A/B test see works better long run. vulnerable first come/first serve take immediate risk groups first. flu changes every year vaccines get updated every year? vaccines tend protect longer year. wonder fllu vaccine needing updated every year would still need annual flu vaccine not? however still interpret moving closer abandonment strict priority system. they're willing admit necessary certain situations, situations slowly broaden. seems natural, especially countries like Israel seem success without it. Wait news out, expected approved information needed AZ/OX? Taking 2 tables might enough bring capacity 30%. order based fire occupancy capacity way restaurant usually fits. patience, eh? says is? People getting vaccinated.

Why choose every state? don‚Äôt get connection article. 1Bn infections world wide yet there's handful documented reinfections. means naturally acquired immunity essentially 100% least months long time scale.

The vaccine manufacturers currently claiming, what, around 95% efficacy--and shorter time scale.

To thus suggests vaccinating people gave already COVID, when's there's still millions people haven't, us wzte vaccine. hopefully get Pfizer Moderna doses too. slowly becoming possible vaccinate large chunk Europe Summer. california strictest restrictions country, florida *NO* restrictions. expect stark difference, subtle increase. average wage $40,000 Cuomo's brother big name one biggest major media outlets United States think lot people would talking complete failure actions throughout entire pandemic. Good God, New York deserves better. agree, people vaccinated better chances have. tried animal style ones? right. None I'm aware of, supports likelihood long term side effects vaccine either. mRNA vaccines also fairly new technology, see concern could there. active imagination, come unlikely impossible situations. list here, want taken context recommend people get vaccine. sister wife getting weekend. PCR test nucleic acid amplification test. Antigen test detecting viral spike antigen sample specific antibody. dependent viral load NAAT sensitive antigen test higher error rates since doesn‚Äôt involve amplification step like PCR.  guys need back conspiracy shit. 

Hospitals apocalypse. busy like always every winter. 

We've fine months end restrictions. Hard imagine, true. small numbers. Growing exponentially. Since bot step in, fortnight = 2 weeks. Nice, I'm Assertive Community Treatment, med symptom monitoring 7 days week + call. Glad see social workers getting feel like largely left conversation last 10 months. could avoid it? transmissible! Yes, blame old folk voting piece excrement thing attributed lust power greed. think fairly empathetic person can‚Äôt imagine letting hundreds thousands people die make money and/or protect ego. elderly person sounds whole lot better options like living old age home. friend ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt understand God challenging family like this‚Äù. 

The audacity ignoring people telling better months... hear it‚Äôs shape ears.  little loops masks don‚Äôt hold. also susceptible letters P R English alphabet. Simon Pegg!?!?? hospitals reached point crisis make tough decisions patient care,‚Äù Dr. Christina Ghaly, county‚Äôs director health services, said press briefing Monday. urged residents avoid emergency room unless they‚Äôre need serious medical attention.

....

When hospital tells avoid emergency room it‚Äôs dire. people less inclined risk lives others. tighter mask, generally, better functions. 

Although understand mentality wearing mask time around dozens people. much last time. think people really underestimating impact church services indoor, mostly maskless distanced, involve singing chanting (more breath getting exhaled). They've absolutely untouched enforcement nearly year. Another crazy psychological phenomenon individuals tend intervene faced trolley dilemma. intervening allows individual say responsible anything, lack action action itself.

When comes leaders politicians, lack action means blame gets places politician something bad happens. intervene, bad consequences actions fault ""doing everything could."" live too. make apocalypse everyday.

Hospitals busy, always winter. Nothing imminent crisis like sub expecting 8 months.

Life goes normal otherwise. actually? I'm kind shocked wonder though Thank Im sorry ignorantly offended fellow brazilians. tad dramatic, seems people care sources data statements confirm already biased believe. This, however, blatantly baseless statement, simply cannot (in science) make long-term claims something unless data support claim. vaccine, even approved (emergency use approval approval) less half year clinical data, nearly enough support statement. job you!! point, I've specialized employment services, still, SPMI adults, home visits. Sometimes go congregate care residences, qualification getting vaccine now. Good luck two too!! borger  Floridian, agree. would rather lack doses lack vaccinated.   CNN is, usual, stupid.

I think they're trying say severe cases (requiring hospitalization causing death) group received vaccine compared placebo group, i.e. 100% reduction. Less severe cases reduced 78%.

What means terms statistical efficacy would depend size sample group I'm statistically illiterate figure even knew was. without knowing numbers state pretty meaningless. think thats case lot people. wife got (I got Moderna got Pfizer) 1A - family ""essential"" worked throughout entirety pandemic, like (my wife direct contact clients) clueless get there's zero information released ought go so. looks like problem related crowds came excitement opening new location.

Its fucking burger. kind idiot get excited fucking burger middle pandemic?  far know particular reason fear chain locations (any average fast food joint).

People avoid places demonstrated high levels covid infections. try think underlying reasons. X outbreak, avoid X. counter argument there's ethical obligation vaccinate people based career, big example school teacher get banking executive. agreed idea, actually, concept. we're actually vaccinating people, I'm becoming convinced systems place make something like work quickly.

At point think I'm interested system ""the better."" That's Israel they're first country reach double digit percentage population getting first dose. think go works effectively, original plan seem meet qualification. sure papers already out...? check, results came today. Probably papers n9t yet Sure, ok, people society vaccinated, safer are. Im sorry offended, Bolsonaro internet believe otherwise, also world keep electing maniacs beats me. David Zweig

There‚Äôs reason every country world based prioritization (though priority groups may vary). given every single shot day got it, today we‚Äôd sitting 20% US immune instead 14%. That‚Äôs enough difference change anything pandemic except individuals got shot. don‚Äôt want wait reach herd immunity see difference deaths (which won‚Äôt least summer), smart thing use limited number vaccines wisely. 

If actually shit together, it‚Äôs harder push vaccine specific groups push general public. rollout lagging poor planning, organization communication.

1. Make air really cold oxygen gase turns liquid precipitates out. make liquid barely warm enough things boil liquid oxygen boil off, make warm enough oxygen oxygen boils recondense pure O2 second cooling process.
2. Rip water apart electricity make O2 H2 (and stuff like O3 Ozone). oxygen made positive anode let stratify get pure O2 without much/any O3 (you also artificially decompose O3 UV Light).

There methods try absorb Nitrogen filter CO2 compressed air make oxygen rich air would suitable therapy, making pure O2. probably lowest tech way, cheapest run volume limitations.

The one make O2 least energy first one, cryogenic distillation atmospheric air. need ton equipment could gotten lot production online months huge amount money. I'm sure this, article suggests almost many people traveled thanksgiving 2020 2019.

Bots lots false positives contexts like this. You‚Äôre ignoring concern long term issues children. It‚Äôs death concern. It‚Äôs false say children immune. 

As far vaccines, studied children now, won‚Äôt issue. started PIII trials later US 2. also reduced trial number 60k people 40k expected faster readout/signal rapid spread. would surprised hear something states within weeks now....

No. localized lockdowns cases pop up? expect continue 12 months well? Im struggling find data agree disagree honest. England delaying 2nd injections (because morons) even though data support delayed 2nd vac injection still work effectively. So, like vaccines, get every couple years? Okay, see that. Hes hero. Rest peace like less efficient vaccines much like hideous furniture carpeted bathrooms. Probably social media driving factor. There's alot anti vaxxers false information spreading like wildfire online Yes, indeed. Science changes. flat earth became round one solar system became 100 billion universes. look CDC data.

Day 5 showing symptoms. use one colorado. thoughts everywhere already using cell data look travel location data (our gov said one metrics using, also states mention press well) least app gives access data well. mean going use anyway might well try gain something too.

I also assume bits information floating around (if amount damn robo calls junk mail get indicator) phone computer usage...again might well get something it.

I really like idea opening door someone watch ever reason. since really anything hide, might keep dumbass walking nursing home somewhere somehow infect them, feel like worth even ended less perfect. Kids immune. get idea it‚Äôs fact? study schools done Germany number students antibodies virus 6 times predicted lead investigator. 

It‚Äôs falsehood say children immune. Important highlight. 7 thousand people took vaccine Brazil, mostly frontline doctors.

The fact none got seriously ill extremely impressive. Remember, vaccine rely on. That's it! edit. Berriaki wings Chico, burger place Davis. Chico sound quite right come name. I've flood awesome food places forgot come back want take cross country trip lol. Wait. genuinely believe get tested? Give people want them. see fantastic effect, people take anyway.  Florida numbers bad might think lot people high risk bar hopping tourists get counted home state. Well, except countries don‚Äôt access vaccine yet. even EU recently approved vaccines usage. mention, US jump start due early deliveries built contracts. I‚Äôm sure comparing countries useful here. top 5 5 isn‚Äôt much brag about.

We promised 20 million doses year end, 16 million delivered 3-4 million given year end. measure, that‚Äôs miss. Even government acknowledged this; sure people overly sensitive it. understand low short timescale. IE body great immunity short run sucks maintaining it. Vaccine seems work opposite. Poor immunity short run second injection builds memory protects us well long time.

In first days recovering likely immune someone took vaccine. Although 'more immune' technically correct think probably get point.  Schools still virtual here, despite loud objections parents. hospitalization ICU rates still much lower spring. Yes surge, think lot ( unmeasured ) cases spring 1/3 many people hospitals COVID compared April May. think 'normality' mostly referring travel ban place. Australians allowed leave country without written permission government get vaccine, goes everyone, try get good night‚Äôs sleep nights leading shot, nights immediately afterwards. Sleep impacts well immune systems function, including antibody production, better sleep help body build stronger defense covid. applies vaccine, too. person schools happening across Florida, could go wrong? I'll take theirs. I'm tired ...

Let take mask off... looks like maybe April AZ vaccine according head Operation Warp Speed:  important question vaccines cure world manflu strain, agree quite serious disease.  read second paragraph? Final mile distribution arms, using doses problem. getting doses manufacturing wherever going. honesty, would take unpaid sick leave next 2 months condition. would even try file disability.

That issue, btw agree you, Norway Finland real winners pandemic, far. done great job initial spread huge lockdowns like rest Europe. Sweden done well them, OP arguing Sweden one worst, nothing else. Thanks sherlock. think T1 diabetic doesnt understand unfairness life? little hard say lagging data states used less 50% doses. sound like distribution problem. Unless saving half doses second shots. Even CA FL used 23-30% doses.

New York already 636 places around state giving shots. say they're getting 300k doses per week. Imagine logistics that. Pfizer vaccine ordered minimum 1000 must kept super cold. They'd break shipments send 636 places.

In Florida number locations appointments seems laughably inadequate. places book 100 appointments day. Different counties use different things appointments, phone, EventBrite, web sites, many crash, none secure. set stadium administer shots give 1000 per day. seem working wrong order magnitude. Florida seems much like bottleneck places giving shots.

Could different problems different areas. Probably surprise states best single centralized health care system like Maine South Dakota. No, them.  problem. Good luck! Following honesty, know even right answer questions. multiple ways go. come tradeoffs. direction choose needs informed science. ultimately, vaccination plan choose values priorities society. gets vaccine first? require vaccination access schools, work, travel, etc? balance safety speed? much risk willing accept race protect greatest number people stake this, need say. Broad popular support path pick essential program's success. battle teachers vs parents continues. Unfortunately, teachers gonna lose, guaranteed. also work stare word long enough fort(een)night(s).

they must planing holiday vacation That‚Äôs entirely speculation. actually unknowable based new vaccine technology used. Thank you. wondering hopefully people receive first dose, stay course stay vigilant getting 2nd. Even careful least better prepared. $100,000 fine everyone freaked million dollar fine week before, slowed delivery everyone added pile paperwork make sure accidentally give dose wrong admit left glibly accepted idea blm protests spread virus rather simply accepting obvious almost certainly contagion vector making stronger counter argument people keep repeating obtuse point refusing acknowledge simple fact mask wearing is/was clearly predominant blm protests would easier count people wearing masks pictures would easier count people wearing masks various trump rally pictures.

I find extra odd county hospital systems. Like hospital within county different system county does. Approval rate batches slow warrant currently wear masks conscious hands go (try touch face nose). Though agree it‚Äôs dumb back face face, many us never got option work home whole thing. You‚Äôll vaccinated Summer, latest, unless choose to. Thanks!

The States actually pretty good pace considering big federalized is. countries wealthy US smaller Israel still lagging behind.

The logistics bureaucracy vaccinating US nightmare. time get time front liners get they'll never get me. many release? haven‚Äôt heard anything Chinese vaccine.

I guess worst case scenario 1/3 population cover vulnerable people workers come contact lots people, cases deaths still go lot. 

US / UK mostly saying normalcy late spring.  basically job too. coincidentally exposed Coworker right thanksgiving denied proper amount leave time showing symptoms ‚Äúthey SURE negative test‚Äù. Apparently covid takes holidays according job‚Äôs useless HR! Myself, wife, sister, 70 year old parents (mother takes lower dosage everything) vaccine completely without side effects aside sore arm possibly headache associated day later.

Get vaccine worry anything later, highly unlikely. doctor know best, still get second dose, even caught covid first shot. You‚Äôll want wait recover getting second one, scenario. decision take physician. Sweden worst mean Sweden done better. Sweden slow inflexible they've handled this. 


Trying say Stockholm metropolis deflecting obfuscating. Stockholm 250 000 people Oslo, count greater Oslo area 1.7 million people compared Stockholm's 2.2 million. like night day like portray it. One biggest psychological criticisms management often lack objectivity production evaluation. goes employees well.

I‚Äôm sure many people feel productive home efficient overall  Time every country world fight it. publish definitions eligible online. call clinic ask. clinic gets trouble mom. would refused shot clinic think get it. ""high-quality information""? Right, said, something like 500,000 US Soldiers. 3/500,000 still ridiculously low, especially something like 1 every thousand people US died COVID. Guess young healthy really helps #Just remember anti-vaxxers, would stamped first 3 months, wouldn‚Äôt even need inject anything anyone. Hard say I'd get tested. Fever common symptom everyone it.

My wife works ""pod"" 3 preschool kids feel indirectly exposed kids families. huge population exposure nonetheless. surprising amount people Ireland anti-maskers. agree, FioCruz Institute also pretty good renowned. need stop bullshit fight federal government S√£o Paulo go anywhere better instead bickering themselves. did, apologies, wrote hurry. 

As second part, agree likely marginal, evasive antibodies course mean change severity cases, likely small number children high innate resistance anyway. case severity-wise? Lucky. tested May November lost mine somewhere between.üò©

That said, 100% sure virus, think January. (Last time sick). edification:More information lying Chinese government. Please forward President Currently living Germany (moved pre-covid) means pay literally everything cash. super markets take card restaurants. Thankfully lot places come senses since Covid started pay card often now. Yes. dimwit.  little story includes discussion antivaxx (republican, naturally) representative covid voted treason yesterday house meant exactly said. want put words mouth, that's choice. N95. fairly uncomfortable compared cloth mask. They‚Äôre designed form tight seal air passed filter. trying ramp 100k per day. New York already opened [636 places around Hopefully California others able follow suit.

I feel like could ramped sooner anticipation vaccine maybe much supply yet. think ramp pretty quickly. 2000% agreed. Houston track become next LA weeks. resident, attest taking seriously. Hundreds examples could listed. it‚Äôs pointless. care. ‚Äúover it‚Äù say I‚Äôve heard many say.

Parks filled birthday parties. Kids running around, maskless. wear masks. don‚Äôt. Restaurants full inside. Christmas New Years - plenty activities go family. Plenty travel. Packed stores long lines inside Christmas.

If UK variant starts spreading here... yeah... We‚Äôre LA territory know it. trials show high immunity ten days first shot. durable without 2nd open question, immunity kicks pretty quick. 

How long ago vaccinated? Wait. counting second doses another vaccination? Ireland seeing biggest wave since April 2020. least 5,000 new cases reported per day r number 2. 800 cases per 100,000 now.  odd work system little less buggy advance. long known vaccines coming? kind like vaccines assumed reduce spread virus nobody tested clinical trials. Protesting likely spreads virus know much US really contact trace. 

It likely protesting without masks Trump camp spread virus masked protest, impact either kind protests largely unknown. thought covid allergies. get tested bi weekly work, tested positive, kept taking otc allergy medication helped. WFH fine temporarily everyone knows working with. turnover happens teams haven‚Äôt actually met spent time other, miss trust, cohesion, etc. unspoken truth WFH.

For long term changes? *Maybe* partial WFH trend continue, 3 days office 2 days out. don‚Äôt think hospitality restaurant industries ever return completely form people learned without. That‚Äôs say they‚Äôll remain entirely obliterated. think big one virtual education, sadly - people happily trade quality convenience (especially introverts don‚Äôt like around others). Maybe high schools universities permanently offer much online education. Ok People downvoting know it‚Äôs gonna magically disappear. goal lower amount people virus protect older immunocompromised/bring numbers manageable amount hospitals. agree trying encourage people get vaccine, seems unnecessarily grim. people vaccinated develop significant complications, vaccine hesitancy decline. vaccine widely available, society bend backwards protect people refuse (most probably even want protection). imagine eventually it‚Äôll combined flu vaccine administered similarly (possibly mandated given severity virus natural resistance built communities) get first dose Moderna vaccine get Covid 2nd dose administered? affect it? 

The 2nd dose Moderna vaccine administered less month first. I'm posting snippet without four 10 Republicans told KFF pollsters want immunized. unlike every group polled, trusted one figure doctors COVID-related information: Trump. Asked name trusted sources, 85 percent vaccine-hesitant Republicans named president. doctor/provider ranked distant second, 67 percent. FDA Centers Disease Control Prevention trusted one third. statistics show they‚Äôre uncommon. That‚Äôs current CDC guidance says don‚Äôt quarantine you‚Äôre exposed within 3 months testing positive unless show symptoms. wouldn‚Äôt case data showed common. T-cell memory hard vaccines (all technologies?) (presumably) effective natural exposure complete active virus? Yeah, lot workers end multiple jobs even private care. distribute blame binary, quite like famous ""pie"" that's supposed grow constantly. 

The tragedy failure economics, sacrifice resilience efficiency. Fewer full-time workers means efficiency, less capacity there's emergency crisis. going get better everyone gets lesson acts it. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* course not. article personal liberties, Americans those! /s think vaccine cover immunity 2 years (if indeed can, still if, encouraging even turns high estimate), would give us chance small issues virus there. immunity doesnt last long always issue highly agree exhausting people solidly keep vaccine date rest life. strength web/network perpetual infection strengthens every less month average immunity lasts. Well said. Give first comers. People need know need it. people young get going hospitals treatments medically necessary. UK variant there, vaccinated, infected, caregivers, fellow patients, many die. offer everyone comes health care shot spot? 15-minute observation period waiting appointment! Well anything lab leak related gets downvoted yeah. there's handful BSL-4 labs research, suggesting could've leaked one US, spread undetected across world, finally become detected outbreak literally right around corner China's BSL-4 lab? mean possible anything's possible kind way come on, leaked lab overwhelmingly likely lab city outbreak first observed.

If like Shanghai something could see that, literally right China's lab was. yes US cases december wuhan first place enough cases noticeable.  True, there‚Äôs extra vaccines layin around doctor recommends future extra safe i‚Äôll get one eventually many would argument first come first serve. I'll line day.  Source please? Bloomberg world Data updated since yesterday.  Didnt shutdown society healthcare workers arent overloaded wait vaccine? Business owners losing life savings millions risk homeless.

If able suspend licenses work refuse vaccine vaccinated. Healthcare workers absolutely large transmission vectors. Melbourne though, went hard lockdown July something like 13 weeks - work home unless essential, schools closed, leave house day shopping, 8pm curfew, cannot travel 5km home, masks times, people outside Melbourne could enter without valid reason, et cetera, et cetera...

This resulted 40 days 0 cases recently...

It takes time study variants, time discovered knew could do, restrictions could government impose? benefit would serve announcing middle lockdown?

We still mandatory masks indoors, work home can, least live people wear masks street... cannot vaccinate fast enough. takes 2 shots plus weeks build immunity. time one easily get Covid, especially UK variant. don‚Äôt time. variant popping states today, know variant spreading. one spreads FAST. Crazy fast.

Keep eye areas found variant next 3-4 weeks see fast spreads.

If don‚Äôt lock hard, daily death count see March, April beyond brutal. couldn‚Äôt even begin guess. 2 times? 3 times? More?

Is plan stay wide open 2021? upgraded restrictions nothing. People following whatsoever - least enough make difference. Frustrating watch unfold. people inoculated viruses? Chances yes went public schools/colleges Imperial College one institutions working ""DreamLab"" app run phone sleep crunch scientific data looking (among things) COVID treatments. They're Phase 3 COVID project now.

Would really, really interesting know choice testing treatments result identified DreamLab.....would stunning case, they'd probably get 100,000,000 people downloading app overnight. assume related otherwise they'd said something....

Amazing news wither way. don‚Äôt believe curious. test positive twice 3+ month span? test positive antibodies second infection? lot anecdotes start ‚Äúwell fever back March‚Äù ‚ÄúI mystery illness February‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard concretely say reinfected without multiple tests symptoms mimic illnesses. One comments mentioned 10 day fever that‚Äôs potential symptom flu well.

How likely number daily COVID infections United States triples within next 4-6 weeks, occurred UK, new strand?

That would put new infections approximately 600,000 per day US. propose firing people. know everyone angry please reread post see advocating firing people. pointing could happen. 

Hurricane approaching Florida. tell people South Carolina prepared. mean wish hurricane upon them. point 25% Atlantic hurricanes go eastern seaboard. likely number daily COVID infections United States triples within next 4-6 weeks, occurred UK, new strand?

Many loudest public lockdown proponents exempt rules impose others. damn. know I'm bit smart arse, point maybe treated state like 'island' things might better.

i [looked seems LA worse state terms new cases. guess LA getting fucked right told okay bay area isnt bad

sorry calling dumb fuck earlier, right, CA's state numbers dont really apply LA right  Thats great keep moving Except multiple outbreaks, additional short lockdowns, hermit nation must live isolation rest world. citizens can't plan anything know new outbreak result another lockdown (I'm Australia right now). Winning strategy! I'd less worried accidental lab leak natural origin, even though lab leak likely concealed forever.

If natural origin, variants location, ready jump humans.

For sure, lab changed procedures now, evidence destroyed, people responsible work anymore.

It would better find lab leak, course, shock fallout discovery repercussions biosafety world. catastrophic. They're likely spread other, fly back USA spread there.

Also - see May numbers tallied science falls in. thought ""last remaining guess""
Could wrong though. I'm pretty sure stat given comparison. use penicillin time least ten times complications that. nobody worried taking vaccine adverse effects. Virology scientists? imagine would happen field lab leak hypothesis confirmed.

It's hard understand thing salary grants depend understanding it. I'm saying they're behind it. 

I'm saying they're using convenient excuse Exactly downvoted it‚Äôs taboo. It‚Äôs politically motivated slander country, could happen anywhere research facts. countries‚Äô deaths per million roughly same. countries‚Äô excess deaths approximately 18% normal. head Americans falsely reporting Covid deaths pneumonia deaths too, googled apparently false according politifact, group fact checking journalists.  spike pneumonia deaths still classed Covid deaths.

11.1 cases per 1 million doses mRNA vaccine 


vs

 1.3 cases per 1 million doses NON mRNA influenza vaccines? Yeah think Western countries gone long enough without facing serious adversity societies started lose sight what's really important. ""Success"", productivity, status really kind bullshit lot ways, always say things people aspiring to, people ""important"" part society. turns people things actually need of, we're really lacking people bit actual integrity. variant named B.1.1.7, call that. covid already? would refuse case (to sound better sub, others need more). Half NYPD virus, probably similar cases everywhere among front line workers. reporters ask question all? Media makes sound like refuse kind flat earthers. *1956 Restrictions lockdowns force small businesses close shop place, big multinational corporations.

So many mom-and-pop type restaurants local places forced business. Who's taking place well? McDonalds, Chipotle, Domino's.

Many politicians/governors/mayors interests stakes corporations would thus see large cut profits.

That's mean. conspiracy theory? Personally think UK strain spreading past couple months anyways. much hope vaccine become generally available quickly. Personally, I've learned forgive people this.

Nearly everyone's reaction COVID emotional, rational (even ""right"" side things). PhD immunology, could propose outlandish hypothesis cells cannot penetrate tumors people would calmly listen, discuss, even humor idea. one emotional attachment pathophysiology cancer. However, propose equally outlandish theory COVID spreading, would anger almost immediately. Emotions lot ideas we're willing accept.

This sounds really bad, helps cope people can't accept science (or even humor alternative hypothesis). people's reaction COVID purely emotional based social/societal cues. Many passionate COVID activists would likely equally passionate COVID denial they'd born highly conservative family highly conservative area. people like change mind, need emotional event (e.g. brush deadly disease).

People responding data. They're responding social/emotional stimuli. lot ways, sort tragically control ways can't even comprehend, we're driven like extent another. think every country double punishment elected officials commit crime. violated law 2x fine punishment. hypocrisy hope roasted media comedians. agree, I'm Batman kind guy. guess it‚Äôs responsible jump October /nov happened everywhere, plus seasonality capitol building. they? would anyone vested interest forcing us live like this? economy tanking. People dying. see what‚Äôs going LA? want entire country? I‚Äôm hopeful vaccine annoyed hell slow it‚Äôs going. conspiracy theory. science reality, dictate resume normal life again. Measures taken stricter longer period time. It‚Äôs funny read operation warp speed rhetoric CDC always fart public. Free COVID testing!  Disclaimer: doctor. Talk doctor

But, also allergic penicillin (amoxicillin), fungus derived protein. COVID vaccines fungus :) necessarily theorise contagious children. Remember kids mostly lockdown April summer holidays, went back school en masse September. 

Not saying either, know conclude data. Like said, popular theory. gain function research continues behind locked doors...

There scientists dismissed theory. others have. Regardless, reality may never know truth told, hell cares someone believes. matters none believe matters none believe.

Trying change beliefs waste time. one feels need, plenty cults always looking new recruiters! shit sherlock problem Bruh nowhere US serious enough restrictions, clearly. Actually wasn‚Äôt.... case. actual Redditor. still get notifications awards source. one... 2... anonymous. sorry going . hope friend able stay safe. Hmm, puts things perspective, positive % around 15? really ideal implies probably missing people infected know researchers allowed continue. It‚Äôs impossible track genetic evolution virus. reinfected? keeps getting better better. suppose 2025 might handle this. number Covid dead slightly higher US, amount people who‚Äôve died compared average 5 years around 18% higher countries. effect, we‚Äôre level. Plenty scientists dismissed idea, idea you‚Äôve missed discussions. Oh funny, many covid tests different ideal timings... come on, really right place jokes?  really answer there's [some least 10% people ""long covid"".. know one woman regained sense smell months later. Japan may large land area they‚Äôre super concentrated Tokyo (which cases come from) even cities quite packed too.

So East/South east Asian countries. Singapore, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh Seoul densely populated death rate SK currently worse definitely showing low test rate selective testing make seem bad number deaths dont lie.

Do believe South Korea lower test rate Japan? checking data making ignorant comment?

You're either troll idiot  That‚Äôs terrible. US, estimates 15-20%. 

Strangely UK estimates also around 15%, though countries Europe around 20%.

The country suspected herd immunity India, probably 60% infected. see worldometer charts india, dropping dropping... we'll wait months sure. Maybe followed thread wrong. Sorry. Yeah, know what? Daycare wide open months. Non union paras going help special needs kids less money. safety, honestly power unions speaks fact unions pretty effective. agreeing btw, theyre unified spotlight get want. Minimum wage daycare workers showing daily haven‚Äôt sense smell since rhinoplasty years ago.  miss it. someone 20's, worse odds Covid? I'm absolutely anti-vaxxer still probably get vaccine good really me, especially vaccines prevent transmission symptoms? mean things like tourism/vacation. fair amount movies shot there.

That's gone hypothesis would credible places 50%+ new cases strain. need whole lot sequencing know case. Seems likely originated UK. Don‚Äôt forget mental health problems, depression, suicides come it. months-long lockdown disastrous policy stage game. Isnt oxygen treatment? Yes, regardless ends, damage done me. lost job, lost friends, lost time, etc, ain‚Äôt coming back I‚Äôm vaccinated. mention agoraphobia-lite many people struggle ages. 

We destroyed much COVID, it‚Äôs going take lot vaccine fix, makes furious. Especially ‚Äúyoung person‚Äù least risk lose. Interesting admitted Pfizer Moderna released trial results efficacy worse 15%. saying anything bad China, usually would case another country claiming 98% look even better... Personally held belief since Jan, 2020. It‚Äôs never popular belief, especially China flu sub early on, are, year later, still holds well, anyway.

I‚Äôm always open belief changed, different truth exposed, 1000+ hours reading researching past year, still hasn‚Äôt shifted. eat prevent financial loss, eat avoid dying. Yes. Except OP, comment responding to, discussing ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù. good chemicals uh... test smell? Yes article stated that. many agree theory well. Unfortunately don‚Äôt know never know, article educate virus history governments handled R&amp;D. Covid-19: deadly retroactively kills ancestors, again. None schools ever glorified day care. learn read write? That's exactly point. I'm planning visiting home numbers comparable say September. would easier determine wide spread virus posted recovery numbers.

The poster gave equation figure might help. covid19 numbers look good enough Chinese. incentive... Get vaccine get keep job! use cloth masks low risk situations like outdoor hiking. 

If get jury duty I'm wearing N95 face shield, minimum. elderly FL large wealthier people similar ages elsewhere. Many retired need go world make living longer. protect virus successfully. that, dunno. point, better report days Florida *isn't* breaking records. invade find theyre hiding Yep.

No issue China usually equals major government cover up.

The truth current government society makeup today able provide proper correct response global pandemic coronavirus. needed new ideas, ideas permanent band aid solution. people like rest world familiar instant gratification instant solution lazy think this.

Natural immunity thought effective vaccine small percentage people hospitalized die Lots scientists contradict theory.  issue isn‚Äôt exposure.

Anyway - think school focus vectors overstated. I‚Äôm going say something like ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt spread it‚Äù bc don‚Äôt know that, can‚Äôt possibly true, info point less. 

Keep mind America wrong lot one countries closing schools long. can‚Äôt believe everyone else wrong right lol. [We 4 separate trust Dr.Fauci joblo random redditor...

 People would still sit hacking lung without wearing mask. would put mask protect them. 


When went upper respiratory couple years ago put mask thanked exam room nurse saw Dr. said would give people masks waiting area would wear staffer left area.

One would think common decency avoid spreading disease

one would think would would realize could catch different germ end worse infection. get infected one virus, one kind bacteria time.

Not fun fact: many pneumonia starts viral influenza settles lungs, person made vulnerable gets bacterial infection too. there, done that, ended ER recomend trying it.

Hopefully medical areas tell people put welcome go elsewhere. US. like someone tried design response maximum business damage minimal infection control time. white racists like US racist toward white people UK SA. Context matters. 

Otherwise think main issue another name (B117 ain't gonna cut it). name yet insisted blaming white people UK calling UK variant (this probably happen places) would racist. 

We start naming variants way name hurricanes. NO. read little bit. first man mentioned article, Kejuan Bates, weighed 800 pounds. News flash body might crap young age big. lungs heart pushed limit goid day size people supposed big. Black people need start adressing weight issues instead repeating ""big beautiful"" mantra. intent usually people saying China virus actively trying put blame china virus originating xenophobic hostile manner.

There's pretty big concern vaccines effective variant, estimated would take 4-6 weeks adapt existing vaccines effective variant proves case. think understand incohesive sentence structure arguments are... Sorry man.

America like 50 countries combined one overarching structure. literally dumb fuck claim single politician, even president, could accurately represent thing. Even vaccine %100 good, I‚Äôd still take precautions time.
Edit: months last person vaccinated time. don‚Äôt want run around gleefully without mask unless ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô stamped forehead. /s I‚Äôll mask anyways. Well pattern there? lot people.

The article linked discusses healthcare workers got sick January supports official stances Chinese government. unfortunate novel virus reasonable take couple days weeks evaluate transmission.

"" game-changing Pfizer vaccine (and Moderna's equally effective mRNA-1273 vaccine) may affording protection [COVID-19 results reflect complete ""sterilizing immunity.""

This type immunity completely prevents disease-causing pathogen like COVID-19 establishing infection. Sterilizing immunity differs [effective latter prevent illness still lead [asymptomatic anti vaccination take covid vaccine. dangerous spread inaccurate information. know (yet) covid vaccine provides sterilizing immunity. 

Here's another section original article talks sterilizing immunity:

""While vaccines known one medicine‚Äôs valuable tools, function complicated people often realize... One key successes vaccines provide sterilizing immunity ‚Äî recipients infected viruses cause diseases don‚Äôt pass on. 

**But smallpox polio aren‚Äôt typical. often**, **vaccines perfectly protect recipients getting infected transmitting pathogen.** flu, instance, virus invade cells vaccine recipients, reproduce inside without causing symptoms, go infect people get sick even die. Instead severing chains transmission, **vaccinated individuals serve links chain, bringing pathogen vulnerable hosts haven‚Äôt vaccinated. scenario common among respiratory diseases like COVID**, since it‚Äôs easy pathogens invade respiratory tracts reproduce triggering major immune response. 

**If vaccines achieve sterilizing immunity, experts say it‚Äôs likely virus continue circulating won‚Äôt see abrupt end pandemic, even big majority people access vaccine agree take it.""** hard. States make list privatized people geographic location. Randomize list, see much vaccine have, schedule many people groups however many vaccine site handle. still might fast, would maximize resources available.

If want it, go back line. waiting weeks hospitals facilities decide roll employees enough spacing make sure make every shift.

But would require coordination governments actually making decisions stick without running sorts committees. know, like things need done time sensitive pandemic. every state ready go full plan thing pull us this, jave idea.

As soon lock downs, setting -- vaccine already rolling out. It‚Äôll drop lot .1% punishing diligent sequencing. Somehow okay, noting covid came China racist. probably violated bunch COVID safety policy fast. Honestly point could 500 million doses ready go still somehow vaccinate 200k/day CVS way. nothing prepare. Expect miracle. Send nasty emails employees inevitably fails. cut pharmacy budget good measure. death certificates also take time made Maybe question intent. Nobody says ""UK strain"" blame UK. think 14 days longest measured time COVID could survive surfaces tested, surfaces killing virus much sooner. think week probably plenty.

I'm still getting downvoted bro, kind harsh response cited sources apparently scientists wrong sub known rare side effect MMR vaccine. seek care 3 days petechiae.  really understand motivation people quietly downvoting things disagree particular reason. Like sit downvoting stuff agree with. Why? Lol they're pharmacies draw adrenaline vial. Partly due constant epipen shortages, mostly due Penny pinching. lots lots 1 millions sub October, yes people actually managed get infection numbers 2 months within whole April-September period (including fake lockdown past 2 weeks). 

I'm sure much stronger. Maybe people tired, maybe think vaccine fixes everything, maybe winter. That's crazy managed avoid it.

We vaccinating people based virus extremely deadly. We're vaccinating people based easing burden health system. many 30 year old males needing critical care. Indeed was, countries generally can't prevent citizens leaving - Sweden deny entry, rather way around. Cataclysmic spreader event

maybe happened february lol. things way guys even dent numbers No, ends problem, companies go back modify vaccine formulas. would set us back 4-6 weeks though. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/hcwsignup/PODS/

I got first shot Monday. nothing strict priority system, complete lack planning part Europe part US. difficult task 8 months plan it. difficult task last minute, every country done. polling days manage get every single person country (potentially) vote. days they're counted winner declared. yet political jobs line becomes magically impossible. can‚Äôt help feel like r/coronavirus hype created people anxiety.

Are new here? place phrases like ""this virus reduce life expectancy much wont elders anymore end year"" first seen. Tony Blair's prick I‚Äôve reaction sulfa (1000-zero platelets blood sample). I‚Äôm desperate get back work, I‚Äôd rather hospitalized again. I‚Äôll talk doc. Latvia Newsom can't anything right. lockdowns inconsistent we're trending horribly. things shut could used last several months come competent vaccine plan. Instead, little screwing also. Guess urgency they're businesses suffering... Yes no. matter population spread matter more.

For example, large parts mostly uninhabited land mean lower population density mean spread slower inhabited area.

In modern countries, 85% population live cities anyway. Yes, vaccinating pharmacies must equipped emergency kit epipens, benadryl, etc popular saying Egypt injustice man. spends week days Egypt 1, visits rest world would come back one day sleep Egypt. saying used describe injustice government, might corrupt, violent, unqualified dictator government modern history Prioritizing, still giving others. US giving anyone access outside groups. throught went second lock down. Yeah - DK literally using every drop every bottle, still got enough doses. Every dose crossing border immidiately sent vaccination centers. need keep vaccine super cold anyways! Guess could say hindsight 2020 

* Puts glasses *
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *laughs European* think amount people US, they're afraid would run less week everyone rushed gave first come first serve. course, priority people would likely slow that. Yeah depressing 'too fast'. Countries 6 months prepare this. absolutely astounding *every* country running vaccines  Millionaires actually moving Florida, list PO box official residence florida income tax. everyone military training, get shit done. Mandates, lockdowns fines effective many countries. problem mandates, lockdowns fines. problem America. thing happened me. couldn‚Äôt find platelets blood sample time got hospital. wasn‚Äôt allowed move count started rising. Lol wish. Germany get together all. Vaccine getting destroyed wrong cooling already weeks behind. tell you, countries handled virus well fatigue Western countries. light end tunnel, controlled. would know? like 9 months prepare thing. came nowhere, right middle holiday season. 

Some countries spent weeks months preparing moment - apparently that. seemed like obvious result. Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore - worked hard preparing vaccination plans, vaccination centers, etc. I'm sure NY CA states surprised vaccinations going slowly. NY 20m people apparently disjointed disorganized plan vaccinated significant portion them.

We ready practicing October waiting sweet sweet vaccine. could've hired people, trained people, involved national guard, etc. seen that. Yeah kind point. Regardless started, there‚Äôs reason attach countries name name virus. assigns blame country. 

If country intentionally released virus act warfare might different but, wouldn‚Äôt exactly people‚Äôs fault. Well 50% also European numbers France, Germany countries.

I think major problem trust mega corporations governments erosed much last 1-2 decades (enough) trust.

Just related corona, many lies, never told last March 9 montha would probably still live restrictions.  work CA last several months...  unvaccinated people pose threat vaccinated people? 

you sound like nazi, btw I‚Äôm glad see responses prepared serious allergic reactions, bear mind occurs 5.6 per million covid vaccine recipients way way way rarer anaphylaxis say, peanut butter sandwich something Russia: Vladimir, great misinformation campaign succeed. America bomb self. quite lot false positive athletes sports follow clearly zero  They‚Äôre probably aggregating death rate across age groups. you‚Äôre young healthy 0.008 sounds right Stay in, socially distance must go out, also wear masks wash hands frequently. 

That‚Äôs dramatically reduce chances getting it. 

Good luck. seem make sense. me, I'd high priority list. Especially yutzes lucky enough offered passing up. exactly that. enough vaccines people willing get vaccinated populations [being targeted right given over-60s, health workers people clinically vulnerable

And actual plan much detailed, official document (in Hebrew) contains tiers priority, sorted target populations within tier. Type 1 Type 2 diabetics considered vaccination categories every state I‚Äôve seen...
Just may explicitly listed doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs included. Even ACIP categories disclaimer. part 1 2 rant well thought out... great work!  *more* contagious? less fatal? Break leg? Pour Tussin it. position know I'm doubting you; opinion, behind false numbers? yes, super easy, still require hands training. mailing come free Oxy? enforcement. governor's order came December 6th shut outdoor dining, theatres, etc limit retail 20% saw trend coming knew would put hospital system test.

Today, Orange County, outside work restaurant serving dozens summer pilates studio 3 classes. sherrif publically said ""I'm going enforce rules, want.""

I feel really really bad businesses, followed rules months need survive. attracting type folks look excuse act like everything normal. think that‚Äôs really true people fairly severe cases. Like they‚Äôre already requiring oxygen. haven‚Äôt heard much people cold like symptoms getting way worse almost two weeks COVID? Australia Island restrict access entry. States US cannot stop US citizens crossing state lines freely. assumed ""our government"" ment America based post history. like post history? he's American, he's suprizingly obsessed (and angry about) lot stuff happening america. big picture international stuff, individual politicians companies. hardly mentions country. 

If he's American he's obsessed anti-American loon. Could absolutely faster bottlenecking ridiculous, want bit hope, [we are, indeed, trending upwards vaccines according CDC data --

* rate right 358,887 people per day
* according actual numbers went 4.84 million morning Jan 5 5.31 million morning, addition ~470k people vaccinated

I'm _cautiously optimistic_ operations continue improve day day. Money compassion. Sad. sucks hard I'm extremely sorry hear :-/ Exactly, thats Israel fast vaccinating! /s

Get facts straight brother, PA denied vaccinations Israel. It‚Äòs pride hurt badly. Israeli, overestimate us :) Healthcare workers need help prevent vector covid too, though. someone needs come hospital cancer care reasons, risk catching xcovid reduced staff attending vaccinated. might classed vulnerable diagnosis something change health put vulnerable list Yea imaging Well made Regan years. People recover. Think people Nazi Prison camps. things love closed and/or banned hope horizon existing again. friends plane flights away, want socialize anyway. work home life work, tv, sleep 4 walls. day, every day. That's anymore. coworkers seem totally fine life is, goes past summer I'm sure I'll do. life want way change without maybe moving, table fiance. control anything more. Nothing matters. 

I used person drive purpose. saw problem, adjusted life tackled problem head on. know life needs, things literally banned, I'm looked like heretic daring want person social life. way solve problem, makes hopeless lost, sometimes wonder life worth it. look forward getting vaccine around 2024. Teach Amazon delivery drivers administer vaccine, entire population vaccinated Saturday, Wednesday Prime member. Sounds like tiny percentage activity country 300 million though trains effective planes. Well desantis caught trying cover covid numbers. hard say numbers Florida accurate guy I‚Äôll list mine

I like getting cold two days. Throat itchy little achy. third day felt like chills wasn‚Äôt feverish

On fourth day got fever gf got tested 5 day

My fever lasted 6 hours. got GI symptoms like bloating diarrhea last 4 days. completely congested

I felt short breath days pulse ox always perfect dunno head not

On 7th day lost sense smell taste

And completely wiped out. Like sleeping 15 hours time level wiped out. couldn‚Äôt even go brush teeth without feeling exhausted. also appetite whatsoever. Lost 15 pounds 3 weeks

It weird never felt truly awful. Last flu definitely worse. wouldn‚Äôt go away. lingered forever. Took 6-7 weeks feel normal vaccine protect updated strains released China? let in. African Americans? Could community‚Äôs also involved? Perhaps many communities outraged police killing unarmed black men. maybe it‚Äôs cops banging doors waking coupe middle night. shooting armed women. understand people immunity either last never there. One study would manuscript article cites. 
 Figure 5G would one showing waning immunity low immunity. 2 positive factors number lack CD8+ cells. 

For overall failure seroconvert (i.e. produce antibodies neutralizing  5.7% produce neutralizing Figure 1d, 7% without neutralizing antibodies mild 83.1% 92.7% neutralizing antibodies recovered patients. statement based in-hospital case fatality rate

I think fair comparison. think DKA patients likely make hospital Compared present food allergies, it‚Äôs nothing. injections require vaccine stored -70C +/- 10C dry ice ready thawed month. thawed vaccine can‚Äôt re-frozen must used within five days stores 2-8C. 

They may stored 6 months ultra-low-temperature freezers like liquid nitrogen tank. Operation Snail's Pace. There‚Äôs million vets. Near 200k 100% disabled. got covid around nov . Lasted around 12 days . Lost smell/taste like nasal congestion. However , taste came back phantom taste/smell sensations . happen it‚Äôs semi consistent. I‚Äôm hoping time goes away bc it‚Äôs odd hard? Like context, relative dying, lost job? Cant get really british this. God forbid find unloicensed kitchen knife offensive facebook post inside... Meanwhile Canada guess added I‚Äôm low risk complications covid come freedom, stay forever coronavirus... virus. head NIH telling CDC job? *knew* people industry would compare software development.

Here‚Äôs big difference. weren‚Äôt making fixes/tweaks vaccine along way. weren‚Äôt logging prioritizing bugs fixing them. vaccines available literally exact *unchanged* ones initially developed back Jan/Feb. don‚Äôt bug fixes vaccine. either works doesn‚Äôt. End.

You knew that, right? Yea loss smell basically last symptom manifest itself. fever gone time showed We're using concept we're already familiar with; trickle vaccinations Christmas truly horrible, seeing family friends deeply depressing. Another year like that? Fuck, people *really* struggling emotionally December year Imaginary numbers undergrad shit, it? want explain them, testing me? 

Because work, even know nothing QM, could easily throw random links you. prove anything. wants bet Bitcoin happen? Similar Pfizer Biontech? Assumedly good news since increase production likely lead vaccine available outside EU (which believe Curevacs order atm could wrong) Ive worked covid unit since march havent caught it, that's facility actually provides adequate ppe. havent social life either avoiding family friends. Catching netflix, triple games. camped outside Topper‚Äôs Pizza full year free pizza. zero, awful. got it, got grossed food time donated rest. people understand exactly 0 people think that. It‚Äôs ok done absolute shit year, hopeful going new year 2 approved vaccines 3 wings. Interesting. see anywhere trials needed. need government approval give different dosage course they'd need new version. Maybe trials could smaller/shorter 4-6 weeks still optimistic. That‚Äôs pretty much symptom friend has. She‚Äôs day 3 covid already drinking sak√© ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Holy cow thats alot. Thats tens thousands people need intensive care next weeks. hope wont end big tragedy. Nonsense. Borderline Sub rule-breaking. opinion: state back up. Don‚Äôt casually suggest conspiracy. Thanks. happens doses second shot used every vaccine fast possible. goingbto gamble 1 shot enough? second shot given recommended time frame effectiveness lower people still get covid?

Its important right rush fast possible. Mask mandates work effective stopping spread early pandemic CA. States without mask mandates much higher cases winter kicked in.

The reason CA shitshow right governor doesn‚Äôt lead example. Restaurants forced shut film production allowed continue. types double standards caused Californians ignore type stay home order. feeling right side face curb stomped 2011. Sometimes go back Influencers cancer Air Canada. Sweden absolute failure, U.S super failure, Sweden place 25 deaths U.S place 13. Read somewhere teachers 3 times likely infected compared others.. prudent shut schools while.. Population density also big factor, London alone almost twice population whole New Zealand, overall density something like 30 times much.

That said, shut airports UK response shitty. Right yesterday even testing people flying in. think would difficult maybe impossible totally successful lockdown UK done NZ, could certainly much better response far fewer deaths.

I think part issue UK much international travel hub NZ, top looking economic issues trying 'balance priorities' back March, hindsight pretty clear extreme total lockdown initially enforcing tight testing inbound cases way go, long term economic humanitarian death toll perspective. death toll continues rate around 70 per day onwards, Nordic countries continue 1-5 deaths per day, massive divide Sweden it‚Äôs neighbours even evident Question is: overtake densely populated Netherlands france end? countries end year, vaccine South korean approach lock Sweden‚Äôs deaths astronomically high compared similar Well, we‚Äôll se Sweden run past France too, trajectory might make keeps up. maximum 15% antibodies Stockholm...lots go stops, it‚Äôs spreading elsewhere country now.

[you think predictions Sweden would fare pretty spot Sorry say, there‚Äôs indikation Finland/Norway‚Äôs Health workers stressed usual. Little none regular hospital activity reduced.

[cancelled elective care news worry, they're going politely ask restaurants close 8pm virus get us night. Thanks, Suga! /s Yes know. 

*Thank god 2020 guys!*

I mean, that‚Äôs works. all. positive test within 30 days die, counted. risk serious illness older people still spread virus vaccine Played what? right, give NZ already got one full winter (June August). three deaths. Northern Hemisphere got hit end previous winter, things warming up, currently middle first actual winter Covid.

It turns secret getting winter Covid metric fucktonne community spread autumn... aboard police state train...CHOO CHOO! things go south, go south math.  friend get vaccinated. spent two minutes needle pusher.  Two minutes, 300 million people, 2 = 1.2 trillion minutes needle pusher time. Herd immunity vaccination.. nick time. 2 -3 months people hold for.. need party' New year's. Meet family Christmas. Can't they? states Australia much less autonomy US stopped people crossing borders states outbreaks. California 39million population. Hurry Up! 9 months prepare this. pressure Might well waste anything get many people protected possible.

Better people storage. Meanwhile everyone talk knows someone got twice. Lots reinfections. Come CA kidding right now. 1 million 10 days 3 M/month pace. need 5-6M/month range least takes every position usual, pathological liars dozens.of us stop posting alarmism seems non-covid deaths much lower usual, normal winter death count suppressed covid distancing, also degree time-shifting - ie basically covid killed many spring might survived winter.

Based what? least UK, Spain Italy overall mortality starkly rise last months year. right speed. India planned 1.3 million per day next week. Let's see goes   understand, I'm trying say follow flu seasonality point. incredibly complex fully understood yet viruses strongly influenced season. Likely lipid enveloped viruses (for example sars-cov2 influenza) affected humidity temperature. Apart weather systems time daylight (vitamin levels) effect.

Going back original point NZ [this map worldwide peak flu helpful. [this timing flu vaccines. 

New Zeeland peak season July-October, reason said starting March last years earlier usual. Public Health Physician Sarah Jefferies says GP consultations flu-like illness increased seasonal levels end May, peaked late June declined baseline level end July. 

 Dr Jefferies says pattern flu New Zealand similar Australia, early start influenza season higher usual activity start year, declining numbers following peak July. bottom line zero cases (with closed

But, he‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo. 1 leading expert‚Äù. Smfh. would love see source this.

I‚Äôve seen many blatantly false numbers, vaccination rollout much worse reported. shit Fauci. forget administration that's running things made brightest even semi brightest individuals. virus would lose entire spike protein. 

And mutates much, might longer able infect cells all. spike protein great target.

...but worth nothing anti-spike ABs neutralizing, are, tiny needle virus might able thread. trying fearmonger, absolutely literally impossible like claims are. Right it‚Äôs long term care homes healthcare providers. health care provider must prepare supplies, drive long term care home, reconstitute vaccine, fill forms paperwork, give vaccine, drive back. 8 12 people long term care home would take least 2 hours. also limited number health care providers available.

I'm arguing vaccine, stating expect happen based experience nurse. not. restraunts big events. Churches gatherings beach thousands people. addition idiots Christmas new years parties. rubella measles diseases cause thrombocytopenia MMR vaccine includes weakened viruses?

Then again, someone said anything causes immune response cause ITP.

I'm staying home counting minutes gets shot! ‚Äúpretty clear‚Äù you. fact don‚Äôt know started. wuhan market said super spreader, necessarily origin.

The antibodies COVID-19 found Italians September - October 2019. That‚Äôs months wuhan outbreak. work out? working fine states like Maryland, Delaware, Virgina highest population density state country... New Jersey. 

Those states making US states look like complete failures posting much lower infection rates per 1 million people. course countries, like Japan, make even states also look like failures, FL certain one states well per capita.

**The point is, works highest population density states, works everywhere,and trivial see unless moron.** healthcare workers busy right now. Ok:

I get point measures stricter necessary, considering staying home wearing mask pretty much yes/no still base point since people still follow them, doubt follow stricter rules unless heavily enforced.

I've read multiple sources yeah, makes sense referring long take release new vaccine overall, since already main component.

My point canada flooded new virus 40/100 vaccines, sell mexico previous virus vaccine proved ineffective strain. There's reason adjust rollout since know much new strain, countries enough vaccines pass next batch maybe.

I'm aware deaths per million excess report graphs. asking link regarding covid death reporting US. posted subreddit yesterday: find FT article interesting, I'll interested see results dates line (there's three week gap UK US, example). Across countries UK/US. Italy's data appears old, example.

Also, link politifact Florida only. I'm sure entirely representative? Potentially, yes. However, there's getting there... Convergence via transportation, entry, egress. Perhaps I'm overthinking far what's happened vaccination even pandemic overall years worth planning pandemic seems vastly underthunk [sic] Gonna kick covid's butt don‚Äôt understand ever question. See job job people understand recent mutations far dangerous random background mutations. reality bother talking mutations matter ignore others. mutations spike protein big concern built much treatment process around spike add concerns, mutations genes related spikes sit atop virus. Tests detect virus, well Covid-19 drugs vaccines, targeted spikes. concern spikes change, possible tests, drugs vaccines might work well. medical students patient contacts. I‚Äôm talking residents. 

And quite frankly resident dermatology, seeing lot less patient covid...where patients screened fully masked....is really high risk covid. People hear medical staff, think covid ward ER. bulk people work medical field neither.

That's use huge square footages here. well, square meters. US absolutely need set compensation fund harmed vaccine similar vaccines. sort complications rare, happen. People compensated die seriously harmed right thing.

PS: mods also need stop deleting posts banning people mention adverse reactions. reactions real covering makes people trust vaccine less, more. saw tweet nursing home residential employees, working frenzy dangerous vaccine was. shame. definitely is. Operation Warp Speed requires medical facilities report who's getting vaccine many people getting it. this, there's lot accounting needs done slows process. 

Im defending slow distribution, process getting vaccine need. this, would see class inequalities people paying move up. support claim. Presumably container (i.e. stuff brings RNA past immune system cell first place) different. Biontech took container readily available. think wasted much time studying many alternatives. Then, guess, handling followed. time study different handling scheme hence left deep freeze method. (Biontech CEO record though working testing easier storage regime, takes time could fail).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nice call 'UK variant'. Kind getting sick phrase getting thrown around. Thanks, I‚Äôve good, folks living 80 going ancient. take care too. That's failure contact tracing detect things getting control. second lockdown happened taking VIC contact tracers two weeks contact close contacts needed isolate two weeks. daily cases got three digits contact tracers finally detected shit hit fan second lockdown announced.

My point control anything shorter three months lock likely farce. Australian states shorter, regional lockdown good compliance government instructions best contact tracing world. mean, states phased approach. seems like it‚Äôs going planned. may ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù definitely plan roll general public closer April.  Yes, decay different rates. measure antibody production therefore calculate decay (given estimate immunity drops low level), it‚Äôs one major things exam trials. It‚Äôs also probably part reason company elected booster shot...to maintain/improve stability antibody production. Honest question. mean people caught virus. vaccine immune system doesn‚Äôt do? another brutal report anyone info accurate drive thru self testing sites are?

My roommate exposed dumb boss came work sick - got tested one sites came back negative still came work. hospital Covid. Roomie sick week. gets tested similar site (not location) negative. I'm still getting tested sure, seems crazy get crazy sick week exposure virus two tests negative (one confirmed false negative) disaster well. america literally anything go right? don‚Äôt see wouldn‚Äôt rush. Anyone vaccinated could stay masked afford start exploring country activities buying groceries. People self quarantining many months. think one side bit pro mask though right? little, late. People 60 also get vaccinated. end every day extra vaccines go bad, literally anyone age get it. Americans gonna American. many people vaccinated USA far? kinda wonder people realize massive project is? Massive government projects take YEARS complete often huge oversight issues. vaccination program size scope without much federal support? Yeah never chance. Things anywhere near efficient Biden takes office begins earnest offer federal support states even subject government's asinine way handling projects. going take least year probably like 2. I‚Äôve heard scientists speculate Shingles cases rise. 

It used got chickenpox kid, immunity exposed kids chickenpox older. ‚Äòrefreshed‚Äô immunity, preventing shingles coming out. 

Now either chickenpox vaccine kid, since one gets chickenpox anymore there‚Äôs opportunity body refresh immunity, thus making easier shingles come out. Cool. literally guide states leaders make vaccine rollout policies. Offer goddamn guidance instead stating obvious. LOL. Don‚Äôt worry, US (while bit France), it‚Äôs still shambolic roll here. Wow, well nerve based damage causes disappear that's healing nerves work. thing happened 6 months surgery. Shoulder completely numb one day came back. hometown. find large group positives(19) Jan 5th. first patient suspected get he/she garbage collcection near airport. gov issued three day lockdown plan test everyone lockdown. policies supposed issued three day period based many cases find. find 51 new positive Jan 6. report 11 cases new cases found Jan 7 2.41 million tested day(my parents tested day too) total 6.5 million tested since Jan 6.  We've big tragedy time now.

Human psychology funny. could shambling, brain-eating zombies showing around US, people would say *""Hope get fast zombies, would bad.""* agree cdc's guidelines literally say vaccinating elderly first hurts minorities therefore reccomended vaccinating healthcare workers first. antibodies different decay rates? measure difference. 

I‚Äôm cautious telling people years could months. That‚Äôs gonna give people false sense security. lol well way going right slow spelled 'Fortnite' /s believe Florida experimenting I'll interested see works out

Not well, Florida failed anyhow. Read article. explain basis assumption. that's fine, reduce death rates drastically though take 8 years vaccinate France hope ""a couple"" 8+ people, hard. Genocide literally can't predict Fauci gonna say times feels like statements must based moon phase whether saw shadow morning. there's bright side least small businesses well. don‚Äôt make antibodies. vaccines focuses specific part virus (spike protein), whereas body produce antibodies bind parts virus. came facility last Sunday. little chaotic first. staff ready assist let us help went smoothly immunized 90% patients. Still trouble employees wanting vaccine. many people getting medical education Facebook. patients way immunized feel little safer, overconfident Based what? seems like guess science  deliveries scattered. days 20 cards, others 0.

Here Minnesota people throw chair 4am sleep cars. kind baloney ask me. entirely true - first AZ would catch cases UK variant ~1/27 covid cases, 4%. Second, (and hope are) use information PCR tests perform dropout screening test. Every UK variant would show positive test, non-remarkable variants well. need sequence samples dropout positives find UK variant. (Samples dropout positive 0.5% covid cases US right now). 

So anyhow, testing would better, purpose tracking much UK variant population, they‚Äôre made work. it's..*spineful*^?? suppose make forced rule fines such? Well disagree there. prioritize long term care facilities hospitals. Unfortunately leads instances people don‚Äôt want it. would nice roll simultaneously select health providers, really idea logistics behind it. far US goes true. would still need approved likely minimum efficacy trial prove works new variant. would probably point safety data current vaccine would expedite process dramatically though. 

I think assumed based flu vaccine language article. trying say could get point eventually future multiple versions proven effective. 

Source: work pharma company covid-19 vaccine people CHILDREN fight virus first time. People constantly circulating viruses, kids snotty noses. adults already fought viruses sick less often.  politician's trolley dilemma. must *always* intervene. letting vaccine rollout fast possible makes look like anything. Can't let happen. new variant spreading see possibility. Even hard lockdown stop it, know else do. noticed drastic difference actually. Pretty sure force immigrants take apply immigration benefits told even take flu shot provide physician‚Äôs explanation civil surgeon cannot flu shot.


Pretty sure force students take campus (also allowed register classes without providing record vaccinations) universities went to.


Pretty sure force everyone wants participate large gatherings like concerts sporting events take it.


Pretty sure force everyone won‚Äôt working home anymore 
, open floor plan office spaces take it.




So yeah take it. Lots face masks Stockholm metro morning compared mid-December. I'd say every 3rd person, colleague says every person. also people transit general. give 15 years ago? run Hamas. State versus municiplaity. State Florida pretty lax, certain communities Florida attempted enact local ordinances times. stupid authorities saying vaccine prevent asymptomatic transmission. respectful threat end right nine o'clock. Sure actually then. means, show nursing homes tell everyone tell elderly friends relatives show get ASAP - sitting millions doses helping anybody. need finish phase 2A.a Subsection 3 vaccinate frontline underwater basket weavers vaccinate elderly. 2 years would allow total cases plummet level even immunity expired threat infected would extremely low.

Like covid. sucked. multiple years protection antibody decay slow 90 days (per university healthcare email) ones body made?

don‚Äôt make antibodies ?

Like I‚Äôm scheduled get vaccine I‚Äôll take course I‚Äôm thinking keep saying 90 days vaccines years. guess would mean booster shot would need 'couple years' keep immunity. Hope figure sure hell want coming back. doubt slow rollout much people refusing US government literally incompetent something straightforward distributing vaccine. Articles focused vaccine refusal taking spotlight government's ongoing inability make prudent decisions implement them. worst idea ever. officials want show numbers they‚Äôve screwed everything. Meanwhile Israel (23 year old) got vaccine drove grandma vaccination center nurse asked also wanted one... Reading title clear thought maybe bus line number something.  providing vaccines clinics right now, going LTCF now. roll get information unfortunately kept much dark future phases.

I would expect private practices coming soon, would recommend someone say HR equivalent call CVS future setting clinic.

I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs info right now. aren‚Äôt vaccines stores don‚Äôt believe while, all. believe clinics. I'm Ohio, work health care, nothing offered last week. trying figure could sign up, ask, supposed found NOTHING. list supposed get first (phases) first phase, yet employer giving us nothing could find nothing.

So give us two days slots pick, slots INSIDE WORKING HOURS, CAN'T GET TIME OFF. Getting time regular sickness, appointments, vacation always huge gigantic ordeal company, find someone cover - aka footwork - still approved manager. 

So then, that, got really lucky could grab slot day already off. find 40% coworkers even want it, around 20% still willing get someone started rumor affects fertility, employees women, lot childbearing age, actively want children know want take chances.

So yeah, ya go. got mine, good luck getting 2nd dose though. I'm gonna call there's way I'll able get time off. even 6 weeks after. starters, [Arizona, Rhode Island, California top (bottom?) excellent news! means going try delay normalcy based unachievable metric. hope go back like earlier promises. I'm legitimately curious problem then. large group people refuse believe something despite given easily accessible undeniable proof, driving factor denial? can't expect stay Alberta year long. awful Who's worse? spike protein?

Our bodies produce multiple kinds cells attack virus. productive, productive, actively harmful. whole idea coronavirus effectively attack part immune system, part body's response counter-productive.

Designing vaccine, trying make something looks exactly like virus, important parts body learns make *right kind* antibodies.

You're trying split difference reaction vaccine vs. virus, scroll dozen comments without single mention this. Thanks üëç Better uncomfortable days sick weeks possibly dying!

The Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office, conducted autopsy Tuesday, ruled connection vaccine, said Darren Caprara, director operations county office.

‚ÄúThe cause death pending completion studies done medical examiner Centers Disease Control,‚Äù Caprara said email. ‚ÄúThe case still investigation, nothing finalized.‚Äù

In statement issued Wednesday, Mount Sinai said could ‚Äúconfirm deny information patient.‚Äù

‚ÄúMount Sinai follows protocols, guidelines regulations governing agencies strictly adheres patient privacy laws HIPAA guidelines,‚Äù statement reads. ‚ÄúTo extent aware incident involving patient, appropriate agencies contacted immediately full cooperation.‚Äù

### ‚ÄòHE PRO VACCINE‚Äô

To Michael‚Äôs wife, Heidi Neckelmann, death illustrates risks ‚Äî however unlikely ‚Äî associated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Neckelmann, responded requests comment Miami Herald, penned anguished [post announcing husband‚Äôs death asking friends share news widely, make public aware possible side effects vaccine.

‚ÄúHe pro vaccine advocate got himself,‚Äù Neckelmann wrote. ‚ÄúI believe people aware side effects happen, good everyone case destroyed beautiful life, perfect family, affected many people community.‚Äù

The post shared 20,000 times. [online fundraising set Neckelmann‚Äôs behalf far raised $20,000.

In post, Neckelmann said Michael ‚Äî called ‚Äúthe love life‚Äù ‚Äî vaccinated Mount Sinai Dec. 18 within three days noticed bruising feet hands, prompted hospitalization. Doctors hospital diagnosed Immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, [blood disorder caused immune Neckelmann said. Michael died stroke attempts raise platelet count unsuccessful.

### 5 MILLION VACCINATED U.S.

In statement, CDC spokeswoman said agency ‚Äúaware reported death Florida individual received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine two weeks passing away.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur thoughts family heartbreaking time,‚Äù said.

More 5 million people received COVID-19 vaccines U.S. date, spokeswoman said. CDC Food Drug Administration tasked reviewing COVID vaccine safety presenting findings safety experts, required provide ‚Äúindependent review,‚Äù added.

The Pfizer spokesman said company ‚Äúclosely monitoring adverse events individuals receiving vaccine.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt important note serious adverse events, including deaths unrelated vaccine unfortunately likely occur similar rate would general population,‚Äù said. still looking 6 months tweaked vaccines get arms. like fucking headline......every.damn.day. I'd rather organ damage dead. get Christmas card list? like always said: people move Florida die. I'm also North Carolina prouder fellow North Carolinians. thanks Health secretary best coloring book charts graphs nation!

In fact seems like exactly right time reopen Wake County schools, welcome back students Carolina's campus Chapel Hill January 19th!

I course sarcastic. absolute tragedy. Governor Cooper still afraid Chamber Commerce baffling. Aye aye Captain. I'm praying do, going second year miss birthday. want things get better. Why? theres damn pandemic, masks required transportation. Well, they're fast stuff they. Especially military. feeling bit anxiety South African mutation. I‚Äôm glad hear part. understand regular infection give immunity long certain level antibodies. However antibody level decays based sick were. asymptomatic cases seen, 110 days shortest time recovery reinfection. would say conservatively 90 days time antibodies asymptomatic infection decay. seen one test patient seriously ill, low levels decay seven months, don‚Äôt know long last. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Rare earth metals, prices tripled, would suddenly become economical extract places currently economical. places ones essentially unlimited supply (sea floor sediment, etc). 


Even something like electric car order 10lbs rare earth metals. order $50-200 raw price. maybe 20x price would noticable, 20x price suddenly rare earth mines popping asshole. 


Drinking water, similarly, realistic problem. Water difficult insofar logistical headache. Desalination order dollars per thousand gallons. bulk water price got to, say, $0.1c per gallon ($10/day average household) would see pipelines springing developed country experiencing scarcity. 


A single Keystone XL sized pipeline would carry approximately 10% Toronto's water supply. would order billions supply water major city within 1000km sea. sounds like lot, assuming change behaviour _and_ solution built economically profit. 


We resource scarcity. far, far away resource scarcity. Like Irish farmers dying starvation Ireland exporting enough food make every Irishman fat modern American, scarcity driven economic factors environmental factors.  2 mRNA vaccines scientifically proven lower chance developing symptoms testing positive. saying? protection 100%? vaccinated people may infected virus without developing symptoms?

I said masks stop completely whether distancing help.

Wearing seatbelt probably would helpful car hit train. totally protection, more.

You're smart here. sore arm tiredness, day. Good result. I'm happy!  think public perception vaccine availability deployment bigger adverse effect positive effect vaccine deployment.  Except Sweden did: fair last months dying slowly cost lots money. think fair expect early summer normality least reasonable degree Human beings mostly scared herd animals severely hindered status quo bias unable think beyond official statements slow-moving bureacrats interested protecting status taking effective action.

First stay home orders removed, shuttered businesses allowed increasingly greater capacities, eventually masks come majority, 2022 2019-normal. reach acceptable levels normality (freedom work movement) June. joke. sarcastic. making nervous. recovered. Anything look for? Yes get it. Teachers staff yet receive vaccine (in many states countries ( yet push get kids school. 
Even educators get vaccinated today, would still take weeks effective.
I understand need socialize, baby sitting facilities get good education. also hear science behind kids safe messages, buy even science cannot tell us kids handle infected (future) adults matter.
I one think need wait educators vaccinated + effective time, kids brought back in.
At least, virtual choose. Science evolves information data becomes available. That's science is. course, something hide, would open info. levels neutralizing antibodies produced infection depend severity infection. protection get vaccines much consistent predictable. That, me, leads believe vaccination-induced immunity far superior naturally-acquired immunity Hospitalizations still going doubled spring summer surges. also specific infection mechanism virus, likely stable mutation still works cell entry key functional specific mutation simple extension duplication mutations would still immunized against, since vaccine uses monomer protein. mean yeah...if half population takes vaccine, there's way eradicate virus.

In theory - vaccine proves 95% effective like trials, everyone got it...it could come close eradicating virus. Coupled social distancing common sense behavior like masks virus would nearly go away. governor invited covid come stay little? Oh, see. thought would work cure. 
Ok then, thanks Would nice also vaccinated Palestinians whose land occupy.  media still tracking every case closely now?

I've thought this, think answer no. People already fatigued hearing virus now, compounded time goes on. next big stories everything lockdowns took away: educations, careers, small businesses, failing economy. huge inflation, kids never came back school, substance abuse issues ignored talk virus come forefront. course believe also believe virus come China im even english know word.. Right I'm kind amazed humanity survived far hear dumb things we're currently  There‚Äôs good reason think uk variant reason spreadingso much really unique American covid fatigue bs. countries r widely spread found seem similar spikes  yet read immune evasion mutation/evolution COVID-19, source that? 
Current mutations heard/read delaying incubation increasing spread efficiency... Daily reminder New York City [vaccinated 6 million people \(80% population\) *1947*. genuine questions: many people catching covid hospital? patient goes hospital something else catches covid they're there, count ""coronavirus hospitalization""? Could causing us overestimate many people hospitalized result virus (rather hospitalized something else happening pick virus)? 

Also, happens someone goes hospital something else, catches covid there, dies original condition? count coronavirus death? Indeed That's wrong. Please comment things understand. This. still know long HPV vaccine immunity lasts, far good know exactly need wait. That's good! could get one... media still tracking every case closely now? move on?

I think media/consumer model backwards. media going report whatever people want hear about. that‚Äôs then.
By Covid19, nice knowing you. know certainty vaccine illicits healthy B cell response? far looks like everyone working assumption ""the antibodies work, we're set"" without much room recognizing many pitfalls we're surrounded by. Work home permanent vast majority cases. value team cohesion simply high lose. soon powers (corrupt mayors governors) allow companies bring employees back, ass office chair faster say Coronavirus. Australia banned outward flights. Calm Theirrates steadily increased month anybody know taking bit long release initial readout data? current infection rates US, least dozen cases among trial participants daily, no? Man let tell ever dumber one. thing said people romania. We're even actively trialing vaccine. Nationalism like really stupid. mean Chyna Covid right...? debt asking heck money went.

When CARES Act passed Democrats best make sure oversight money, less 6 hours signing bill, Donald Trump fired man supposed oversee money, SIGPR.


Leaving - far find - literally two people overseeing trillions dollars - Donald trump Steve mnuchin  Would love get vaccinated Tottenham Stadium! Agreed. virus step ahead mitigation efforts.  reacting pandemic. It‚Äôs still known COVID-19 started. Yes wuhan big event initially started pandemic there‚Äôs reports earlier year parts world. Yet people still refer ‚ÄúChina flu‚Äù there‚Äôs increase racism attacks towards people East Asia.

The fact shouldn‚Äôt matter started. people sadly like point fingers blame awful times. Ontario vaccinating slow, suspect we'll first country let vaccine expire administered. party telling public panic - least senators short market positions. party whining moderation fair play. 

Im sorry - trying insinuate equally fault leadership dems? that's utterly devoid facts reality. 


I can't even tell party supposed statement. like several countries.

But countries far bigger populated poor.

Pretty sure several factor need ro taken account. Thank you! joking tho? duh think have. Prove it. attack Capitol today, would high risk COVID exposure result assailants? Sure! takeaway yesterday South African variant nucleotide substitution really bad spot (the position reduces immunity most), still likely enough immunity conferred vaccine prevent major illness. 

It's 10x fold decrease immune response convalescent plasma, need ~300x serious concern. lol what. Google We've fucked load things UK, lot sequencing work outbreaks everything

You're one (only?) countries tried randomized large-scale sequencing positive swabs. Madness UK pumping vaccinations Oxford online, Dutch waiting EMA many people want pay $10k vaccine they'd get anyway later. might delay vaccination days. matter? Right years study this. police speak people broke rules took ""education approach"" meaning gave telling first time. maybe written warning encountered maybe third fourth time would get fine. 

I still think size island. Trust govt relates different factors. bigger countries high trust govt. federalism aspect much problematic though. federal country handled pandemic well. good argument unitary state. lockdown start? It‚Äôs reddit, anonymous assholes don‚Äôt matter thought? actually, ""yes"" ""no"" valid answers. answer straightforward. virus less lethal ""on paper"". Now, dangerous reaction virus need care, nurses machines survive come moment lot others case (because virus contaminate people time compared initial variant), then, chances survival go down. happening right UK, seems Maybe quite close Germany‚Äôs situation SK also failed containment summer *very* close single digit cases day it‚Äôs thousands relative neighbors like Taiwan Australia did. Really sad people throw away good work end square one worse..  got covid back October sense smell still come back.  I‚Äôm going right now. don‚Äôt know sense smell left exactly. noticed got diagnosed candles things didn‚Äôt smell strong actually got sick stopped checking yesterday. I‚Äôm starting feel better realized even though taste things tasted little off, decided sniff test. Put nose inside jar minced garlic got absolutely nothing. husband symptoms. Taste still works smell all. I‚Äôve crap sense smell whole life anyway great I‚Äôm interested see affect return. also music festivals. (cries) Man, down: gets kicked 40% Americans least one gun. around 5% NZ gun. Huge difference. NZ recently banned semi-auto guns, would make resistance police lot less effective. tried enforce quarantine Texas could easily end facing thousand men semi-auto rifles multiple handguns backup. big deal army deal with, would effectively require deploying military lay force law.

*Trust govt perhaps important element covid response.*

Trust effective police response trust it. Even NZ people opposed following rules. mean immune. People hear immune think like immortal that's means. 

This pretty simple.

Lmao right? thought reading title isnt pace exactly right speed? Oh gotcha. Yeah, wish would. voted students back full time still expect us keep socially distanced. think post actually triggered me. Sorry rude you. appreciate do! Guns much legal NZ gun ownership quite high international standards. police carry guns weapons cars special armed squads respond armed offenders. 

NZ unitary state, local police, single national police force, issue police refusing enforce laws. 

I agree worked US people would complied rules. Trust govt perhaps important element covid response. Welp, probably billion infections worldwide handful confirmed reinfections huge surprise.

Also maybe exclude people who've recovered vaccinated get vaccines people actually need it. sad even worse egyptian goverment clearly take seriously.

I problem getting corrected cross facts. really appreciate it!

Stay safe there! Hard say. Lots people fairly bonkers comes go self preservation. imagine South Africans trying go overseas try get vaccine. Well see. roughly 2 million doses given. Seems worth it. America somewhere. people understand much big deal is. Knock feather Testing absolutely scarce beginning pandemic. almost 400 million people, simply need absolute volume tests UK start pandemic, way got tested confirmed exposure person confirmed positive covid. Even then, depending tough. took quite infrastructure catch tests become widely available. 

Also, sure, politicians (are) trying downplay things. dumbass politicians trying ignore reality result doctors across America deliberately erroneously labeling covid deaths pneumonia. people covid need vaccinated?

Why test people see antibodies immunity? missing here. Vaccinate health care workers, LTCH residents, old people, young people underlying health conditions. Lift restrictions, let spread everyone without vaccine gets natural immunity probably effective vaccine 65 anyone's support column, that's bad.

do know many people raising grandkids? Shut fuck up. Life always go planned. know many people take care disabled family members? know many people fall medical debt? know many older couples adopt? fiscally responsible whole life still shit upended medical disaster natural what's bizarre massive downvotes response simple question.

it obviously rhetorical question meant minimize deaths old people opinion Also worth noting, might've glossed article Comparatively, study found 4% 7% people moderate severe symptoms Covid-19 lost ability smell taste. 

In words... guess ""good"" sign one symptom since they're likely mild case?

Also, looks like long suspected, good see another study supporting results. think another takeaway would losing smell/taste telling symptom someone covid positive isolate/get tested.

I'm sorry, I'll weld door shut never step foot outside house. Thank reminding I'm fucked up. get it, 10x worse get covid need weeks get vaccine, chance actually needing day slim?

Usually people stay home work sick prevent spreading anything. vaccine, contagious, even feel little icky, there's actually nothing wrong coming anyway. Whereas covid decide can't afford day off, could killing people.

I think everyone get time need, serious you, I'm sure make it. kind logic make sense me. COMPLETELY makes sense. different needs across different population levels across country. idea exactly wants vaccine, located tier priority fall into. Aye, everyone sucks everywhere.

They're lowering standards approving sooner, they're saying get move on. take month approve vaccine that's already approved distribution several countries. Usual care: every 12 patients ICU 4 died. 


With usual care + tocilizumab: every 12 patients ICU 3 died. Right, I'm one person without experience. absolutely expertise technology accomplish kinds logistics, one accepting ownership process. Sounds good. Enjoy allowed go anywhere. sister law mom got first dose week took next day feeling bit fever soreness.

Possible explanations:

* Epidemic actually much larger UK testing due holiday issues.
* New variant dangerous (no direct support this)
* Overwhelm compromising patient care resulting prompter fatalities like Lombardy, NYC March UK. laws place make sure websites compliant. Laws also make sure data safely handled company creating vetted. additional laws around healthcare privacy data. 

Comparing industry dumb government. takes long time government things like this. lot big bloated government would prefer sued failed compliant according group represents 20% population.

Also, reminder, Dr. Birx + Trump said Google would site would allow enter basic information symptoms page would set appointment closest testing facility. March. Closest got sister company Google, Verily limited run around Bay Area ultimately stopped people needed system ones difficult time accessing site reasons outlined. someone get golden parachute they're wrong speculating reliability vaccine... Exactly.

Whatever feels justified one issue, please consider could used bad. Glad connected process still expecting data J&amp;J soon. wanted approval February, really need get initial readouts within next 2 weeks, hopefully comes fruition.



Single shot going remove huge number logistical issues, key upping vaccinated/day number 2 million. anecdotally, someone know pregnant got True, although lot people choose avoid things would normally they're still risk. think people vaccinated see real normality. Hopefully that's common side effect back killing lately. Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm referring to. Need beyond ‚Äúsome data‚Äù. many people think taking vaccine = clear. Maybe person folks around person Great news. got first Moderna Vaccine shot morning. saying soon start walking nursing home next door every day asking they've got leftover shots? 12 months thing really people 1. believers vaccines 2. know seniors high risk? genomic sequencing there? percentage recent sequences B.1.1.7? Can't vote remotely?  Quite simply tory Silly goose, America, dare suggest lazy buy shitty food kills us faster? 300 million people interested family christmas cards though. Yes hospitolizations up, people unable receive ""elective"" treatment admitted. covid. complain that‚Äôs human beings behave. suggest people never complain take they‚Äôre given never going happen. frankly that‚Äôs hold people, organisations governments accountable.

BTW- isn‚Äôt first major vaccine rollout human history. Yep. lot safety features bureaucracy place multiple cell types needing work together effectively give go ahead highly effective antibodies produced. whole process take week. memory cells already exist though, almost completely circumvent entire approval process. Additionally still blueprint previously used antibody. two facts results memory response ramped sufficient levels within minutes hours detection instead week so. Fauci advisory boards kinda stuff? actual job sit critique everything? feel like says always comes fact?? sad lose much untapped life. 38 young enough fight old enough lead. surprised read that, thought pretty well now. longer keep justifying ""desire return normalcy"" bullshit, longer we'll stuck COVID hell.

If can't keep marbles can't eat anymore, fucked head start with. need everyone get vaccine roll back restrictions. main point restrictions prevent hospitals overwhelmed. vulnerable get it, hospitalizations deaths go way hsopitals longer risk overwhelmed. also additional breakdown case numbers daily press conference today lower age groups. showed huge difference teens younger kids. article, needs explained bit REMAP-CAP trial carried six different countries, including UK, around 800 intensive care 36% intensive care Covid patients receiving standard care new drugs reduced quarter, 27%, given patients within 24 hours entering intensive care

The difference numbers 9% -- that's percent ICU patients would die standard care, could saved new treatments. 9% slightly fewer 1 11, guess rounded 12. almost forgot still EUA. 
does approval general population happen? Wow..that's crazy. feel sad family. seemed UK America care bout old people. Definitely cleaner. virulence potential 1 person vs several thousand. made bad joke. Covid brain making deny vaccines lol

I'll see out. data included results trials, indicate vaccines provide immunity infections/transmissions. think data sets small. studies required. sisters nurses, working ICU, 1 took vaccine want to, took parents begged to. Neither anti-vaxxers, said age group good health arent worried get it, worried possible long term effects vaccine.  need complain all? first major vaccine rollout human history upping rates every day.

Anyone expected go smoothly ignorant. experience...a 102.5 degree fever least 2 weeks more. Took couple months dry cough went away started feel worn down. even group vaccinated individuals could spread virus asymptomatically.

How would work? Someone who's vaccinated low virus count body sneezing coughing. Obviously people can't contagious - enough virus shed, right? check-in folks doctor‚Äôs office wearing ‚ÄúI got vaccinated‚Äù buttons. Meanwhile, mom‚Äôs assisted living facility full lockdown care provider got Covid, Walgreens won‚Äôt another couple weeks. One downside PCR tests might bit sensitive: detect small particles virus enough cause infection, lead false positives got lucky terms death rates, COVID much worst virus ever death rate considered.

There never virus could combine features:

* transmit air surface
* become infected via eye, nose, mouth probably mucous membrane.
* live virus found feces, means flushing toilet transmit back air
* transmit without symptom, people looks completely healthy potentially transmitting virus air/surface
* relatively long incubation period transmit incubation period, people look healthy transmitting

If higher death rate, would unbelievably fucked. yeah get lucky. Usually coronavirus like SARS MERS far deadly. conspiracy theory need make much $$ Pfizer Moderna possible allowing lowcost vaccine frontline worker? ask point idea who's getting vaccine Thank you, really good news!

Gov Abbott wife already gotten vaccinations along AG Ken Paxton mistress. Keeping wearing masks social distancing though, safety.  I‚Äôll bring voodoo rangers bois! Drinks !! said USA originally Five hours ago said USA already seen Christmas spike case counts, seem much one. Cases level shortly Christmas. CEO business major job business. job. Thank clarification, title grossly misleading. That‚Äôs he‚Äôs trying do. everything seen Operation Warp Speed meant cover things state took delivery. point individual state developed plan. better worse. Clapham, public health professor National University Singapore, said three-week quarantine would ‚Äúperhaps slightly reduce number infectious individuals entering population,‚Äù government weigh small potential gain policy‚Äôs steep price.

I think precisely describes problem North America Europe. analyzing pandemic cost-benefit perspective. say things like *oh, extra week SLIGHTLY reduce number infectious people entering population* 

It makes huge difference country high population density lot air conditioned environments community. feel like North America Europe marginalizing longer term effects *slightly* reducing number infected people entering borders perceive we're safe live countries lower population densities. 

I think Hannah Clapham person needs quiet let health authorities Hong Kong job protecting citizens. Good Hong Kong's public health lengthening quarantine period, despite complaining travellers. wish government would diligent like listen whining. government first place, might seeing surge seeing now. Hmmm , pool pond? thinking pond might good you.  Yes, roughly 10 14 days pneumonia start many die. Let's honest... much better everything comes coronavirus  Arabs/Palestinians Israel (20% population) getting vaccines like anyone else. actually lot effort done get get vaccines since many skeptics communities sadly also high covid rates (similar ultra orthodox Jewish communities). 

The Palestinian governments different entities different population, interested vaccine aid Israel, see relevant. Arab citizens Israel getting vaccinated.

The Palestinians civilian control PA run healthcare organization. They've ordered Russian vaccine iirc. Israel help vaccines ones done population, aided test kits, PPE ventilators along.

Israel first responsibility population, Arabs included. Palestinian taxes, politicians healthcare system one first foremost responsible Palestinians. 60.000 cases/day likely possibility. :( We're going next phase vaccinations job. told us mandatory else go ""unpaid leave"". nice way saying get fired basically lol Thanks check website several times day time slots available. can't confirm without 2 years passing really. mean length immunity. confirm vaccine works new strains, much important. always make many vaccines 2 years. mRNA vaccines appear hard make officially really good mass producing this. said residents attended hospital appointments staff necessarily lives outside work. company, Belmont Healthcare, operates four care homes asks staff declare second jobs.

Well, solves it. Yeah think there‚Äôs equally compelling argument goal vaccines protect it‚Äôs also end pandemic soon possible. think mass rapid distribution ends pandemic faster protects people long run trying failing target vaccinate faster virus spreads does. However take point‚Äîit‚Äôs obviously complex issue know fatal disease vulnerable. There‚Äôs easy answer beat pandemic small population island, denying helped greatly pretty disingenuous. imagine downward trend illnesses masks. people beyond denial virus think big hoax joke. Chile I've heard many people vaccination, think kind conspiracy behind it.
They say, president politicians get vaccinated first won't... mean, hell.

Of course everyone thinks that, I've come across way many people say that, getting annoying. need couple years pass. mean lot countries full lockdown second time US really never fully one time. One days, get something right. moved chips year 2025.

Yet, stock market rocking many enjoying gains lifetime. Businesses don‚Äôt want stay shuttered capacity restraints. People don‚Äôt want live masks distancing, closed/restricted businesses. States need things open keep economy going. Hospitals even need open fully (elective surgery, patients less time) succeed. don‚Äôt follow politics, could completely wrong, would society stay way forever? There‚Äôs incentive. Ask they're worried long-term consequences covid, point long-term consequences vaccines pretty much never suddenly come months tested context would come now. There's really much else say. health service‚Äôs lead doctor capital shared worrying analysis senior medics city‚Äôs NHS hospital trusts Zoom call Wednesday afternoon. briefing Dr Vin Diwakar said sheer numbers people becoming seriously unwell Covid could see capital‚Äôs hospitals facing shortfall anything 1,932 5,422 beds 19 January. HSJ reports briefing intended prompt trust medical directors think steps could take minimise looming gap demand care availability beds. Whoooa, thought random dude mob shouting that, tf? Intentional sabotage get everyone sick? lockdown likely means schools shut, except special education. Gatherings reduced 10 five people inside 20 10 people outside. businesses closed, except sell essential products offer essential services. 

Well, good luck, Israel. Hope economy survive new lockdown. Ask show vaccine history serious negative side effect show 6 months administered.

Edit: I'd modify serious negative side effect extremely rare show 6 months later. Covid felt like someone took sledgehammer chest. Multiple broken ribs later every breathe aches. coughs come every 30 minutes suppress feels like someone beating broken ribs. Waking agonizing pain rolled isn‚Äôt fun. Painkillers don‚Äôt work.

3 weeks worst it, 3.5 months total stop chest pain. That‚Äôs mild case.

So far really problem non halal stuff. Israeli here, 60+ front line medical teams prioritized, almost 70% 60+ people already got first vac. However cases, especially places turnout low, became ""free all"" clinic want go waste, eventually many younger people got well (including myself). 

Not exactly perfectly efficient method, do. vaccinated sufficient while. becomes huge breakout country, they‚Äôll start qualifying vaccine. Easy answer. issue states giving preferential treatment regions. going NY disgusting regions even recieved vaccine others already tier 4. Past stat read 42% people states vitamin deficient, so, definitely wouldn‚Äôt help? Maybe. Yep. cost vaccinating people high well. try visit hospital‚Äôs HomePage firsthand? Says reduced planned operations 16th dec till x-mas. (Which think might connected personell issues holidays much covid) Reported normal conditions yesterday. read...I really think grasping straws...

Which seems evident pretend haven‚Äôt discussing covid related deaths registered, want switch excess deaths. Latter could good indicator, also lot harder interpret. knows 2020 would year 87000 died Sweden, 92 000? would numbers Finland? Norway? many lives saved reducing traffic, reducing infectious diseases, alcohol related injuries etc, many lost mental illness-suicides/late Health care causes? It‚Äôs deaths overall, hard know number covid measures wasn‚Äôt thrown equation. 

As parameter worth discuss, also lot easier use obscure comparisons direct covid deaths countries. 

PS! Full excess deaths 2020 Sweden isn‚Äôt even calculated yet.  feeling dad got vaccinated, weeks maximum protection! bad India. sell cure counter. less worried protesters regular people GOP.

[Pro-Trump rally speaker D.C. tells attendees hug yelling ‚Äúmass spreader event‚Äù  great news. 

Speaking Indiana, 80+ group accounts 52% COVID deaths 60+ group accounts 93% deaths. start thinking vaccinating whole age groups vaccine provides 95% protection, deaths absolutely going fall cliff get 60+ group. 

In terms timeline, 22% Indiana residents 60. Total state population 6.7 million, that‚Äôs 1.5 million. Let‚Äôs say 80% willing/able get vaccine. That‚Äôs 1.2 million people cover age group. Indiana currently vaccinating 50,000 people per week. Let‚Äôs assume open clinics every county CVS/Walgreens start covering long term care facilities, 100,000 per week getting vaccinated. gives us 12 weeks cover whole 60+ age group. numbers hold, vulnerable protected late March.  Next mass graves subreddit. one hates big business me. think super big stretch Walmart buying every scientist Western world say need never leave houses. they're faking death count positivity rate. see things decrease government still preaching lockdowns restrictions, I'll give theory credit. way heard explained, tested test specific way collecting sample, sample collected way, can't verify accuracy. reports swab deep nose get sample test might still work, tested. COVID-19 infecting killing adults, mainly elderly, want make sure vaccine first approved population would benefit most. Like RSV infects kids elderly, RSV vaccine trials geared towards kids (immunization pregnant woman) elderly. 

Eventually, vaccine tested children adults would die COVID-19 priority vaccine development approval. pandemic killed kids, would different story.

Also, know, mRNA vaccines never gone children prior clinical trials, adults. would need careful figure full safety profile adults go kids. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think impression bolstered what‚Äòs written internet shown media. I‚Äôm confident good majority people won‚Äôt hesitate take it, like people vaccine. anti-vax goons well, doubt. Hope China hold months vaccine starts get deployed temperature warms up. think Florida regards heat summer, maybe high humid, stand shade minutes go in. never pale ny life havr florida &amp; amount cas√©s &amp; nonchalance &amp; need neighbors park golf carts cars front home, 15ft lanai, talk old people stuff like Charlie Chaplin dust moth balls?! don‚Äôt know one wears mask. I'm sure herd immunity matters much vs enough high risk people getting hospitals constantly overwhelmed. Plus nobody knows long vaccines natural immunity lasts means herd immunity could still unreliable concept. 

Either way though need get people vaccinated fast possible, would really matter immune still get watered common cold like COVID19 infection. 

We could still get spread time get vaccinated 'naturally selected' long enough period time disruptive society.. that's want go out.

The big logistic problem reason talk herd immunity everybody going think get herd immunity.. BOOM done coronavirus specifically USUALLY immunity wears 6-24 months. currently, ABSOLUTELY, reason think different matter public policy. dream want, matter policy assume vaccines wear unfortunately rapidly vaccination part again.

To puts nail concept people consider herd immunity.. like immune problem worry all. 

We stop calling varying levels immune resistance immunity, confusing use world immunity mean many different things medically also used non-medical terminology synonyms like invulnerable. 

Lots times immunity enough resistance disease big problem, virus proof shield obliterates virus gets within 5 feet you. Yes, data leaked, Israel ordered early paid more. government charged $39 two-shot dose, European bloc even less, Jerusalem said agree pay us give shit others aware. side note, japanese government announced Tokyo olympics take place year. Yeah, agreed. think (especially sub) take stance Covid case tragedy must eradicate matter societal cost. dunno. whole purpose lockdowns never eradicate it. whole point ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù many that‚Äôs changed ‚Äúeliminate Covid‚Äù. family friends work companies, tell that's absolute lie reason said make stock holders feel good themselves. Paint shop manager overwhelmed calls asking paint. course. Demand far outstrips supply available (I.e. that‚Äôs sitting shelf hospital hell it). It‚Äôs still appropriate approach. Even assume life worth nothing (not agree that) probably still good move economically. best thing economy getting virus control. Westminster hate us here. figure NRS speak themselves. words, need leadership.

If someone gets lays national guidelines based actually working everyone get board that. Without leadership everyone trying figure own. recommending time stupid imo. nothing else, recommendations simple easy follow. keep track time wear mask simple enough. something between, reduces eliminate immunity. risk concentrated 12-15% population. vaccinated first risk drops significantly like 80%. Yeah third health care workers want get vaxxed, even they're offered vaccine. cases vaxxed rando's go waste. 80% fatalities 15% population (65+ pre-existing conditions). 40% fatalities less 1% population (nursing home residents). get ""right"" 15% vaccinated fatality rate drop 80%.

So one hand little bit targeted. other, states using like 20-30% vaccine. think reserving half 2nd dose using half what's left. clearly worried getting another shipment time. get pretty clear going scarcity doses. referring everyone already got sick, every virologist, immunologist, biologist, epidemiologist internet collectively facepalmed behalf. think would accepted, country would want exclude billions people, unless something seriously wrong case get revaccinated. Music rights groups another scam. barely represent artists. mostly represent huge corporations purchase music catalogs bulk extort money retail online listeners. scotland 

Any links supporting please? I've look can't find anything even implying Independent pharmacy here. CVS Walgreens many damn lobbyist made sure phase 1 local Independent pharmacies like mine would already administered vaccines patients already support daily basis....  1. Israel got Pfizer vaccines, Belgium, US. First dose 100,000 Moderna vaccines landed today.
2. Israel got large number vaccines ordered early back summer, paid double. gambled paid lot money outcome. early money used set production capabilities started churn vaccines even FDA approval (since already paid for). would fine unlimited vaccine, don‚Äôt. state 300k doses unused. Vaccinating 300k people 65 prevent huge amount hospitalizations deaths, meaning hospitals continue function. keep people alive car crashes, heart attacks, pregnancy complications, on.

Vaccinating 300k 20-50 year olds got twitter facebook alert hopped car stand line six hours stadium mass vaxx event (infecting people around half won‚Äôt wear masks won‚Äôt wear properly) prevents far fewer hospitalizations deaths.

A basic tier schedule system would work lot better. 300k doses gathering dust 1.6 million residents 65? vaccinate public facing healthcare workers everyone 70. register scheduled vaccination appointment (at covid mass vaxx site) online, phone, local cvs/walgreens. 
But god forbid state planning allocate money build system like plan ahead past six months. Lol TL;DR: yet clear long extension would last. 10 months study?? Hurry up!!!  trial protocol¬†shows people history severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) ""to component study intervention"" able take part

The trials insufficient(for emergency approval); Pfizer knew vaccine tested every circumstance. would interesting know vaccine even approved people trials ongoing people get vaxxed real world

That's studies work. use data. requirements data proving vaccine, drug matter, stringent.

But thanks link! time everyone vaccinated, first ones dead old age... someone eligible vaccine phase 1, due non-covid facing healthcare worker behavioral health provider, private practice, means getting vaccinated work, call cvs make appointment? need see license proof eligible? Yes normal initially vaccines tested adults. 

One reason children able fully consent themselves, rely parents least part. creates ethical dilemma trying something new someone technically consent. 

The approach may used thing tested children test small number children, waiting time slightly forth. ensures risks identified many people hurt takes longer. 


In addition case adults face much much greater risk covid made sense concentrate primarily them. Hopefully know something don‚Äôt ... need years 6-9 months protection Hi Australia. Current plan start March medical workers perhaps start rollout October. Yes. October. See think growing sophistication surveillance technology, well actual evaporation barrier work home (your home literally also workplace), means WFH advocates pretty rude awakening long term. Israel show us soon level herd immunity is. Rather, took massive bullet (lengthy strict lockdown) hopes avoiding worse bullet later. Belgium botched first month, enough vaccine orders 1/3 population (unless pad AZ one 2/3, good vaccine). expect see normality mid-2022. lockdown joke, ""All restaurant business close 8pm"" thats it.

FDA news release isn‚Äôt terribly clear, sounds like EUA effect indefinitely. sounds like final approval basically slam dunk unless kind safety issue comes up. third kind weak third hear government media daily basis think problem creating panic hysteria. feel like I‚Äôve uttered words many times last 4 years. events go back summer 2019 reviewed together seem suggest lab leak happened ""somewhere"" world necessarily China. course, could easily China, several labs access. mentioning possibility overall less deadlier version virus might spreading world small clusters prior Wuhan seems make people upset downvote like crazy. claiming drop antibodies low rate vaccine effective around 2 years? depends restaurant. Small mom n' pop restaurants, ramen bars, izakayas, etc. packed social distancing. both. 95% effective reduces serious illness 5% end infected.  Uhhh we're vaccinating quickly centralized healthcare system, paid lot countries get vaccines asap, small densely populated country, lots trained professionals military/healthcare system, ran successful vaccination campaign. important vaccines get arms try perfect prioritized distribution. Obviously means people get earlier really people end waiting longer. Sorry perfect that's life. keep trying careful trying get vaccine hopefully get sick first anyone know - vaccines (moderna, Pfizer, Astra, etc...) protect transmission?
I. E. Even I'm vaccinated, catch covid &amp; spread it? Yes, say born 2004. I'm real sick getting nickel dimed subscription services That‚Äôs new idea Remdesivir studied suggested ICU patients months.[Remdesivir comment links removed. You‚Äôll Google it.

Yup, key keeping hospitals overflowing make gradual transitions. Ever hear anybody say ""They make cute couple... 3 5 them!""

A couple 2. 2 drinks, that's few, several, many, depending vaguely many is. I'm honestly sure what's Lee County (they're ones see news old folks waiting outside 5 am). 

But would Collier Charlotte options? I've seen appointment systems those. got two Naples hospital spots morning folks. really, there's huge difference disrupting car factory (and still compensating company) taking lab.

Not would technical hurdles incredibly high facilities likely suited GMP conditions (regardless BSL status), work goes BSL3 labs often something simply start stop.

It's steep cost likely nothing substantial gained. much better building new facility 6 months. 15 millions received coronavirus vaccines now. heard much beyond allergic reactions death natural cause. Demand larger supply many months come people taking vaccine problem much later. Damn say let natural selection thing That's done got shot today Israel. waiting hours line every minutes nurse went line took elderly, ones higher risk certain professions (health workers, special education workers, etc..) skip it.

And uninformed, since simply schedule slot instead waiting even couple minutes line. Yes, made clear care people. sophisticated personnel online appointments like cvs would.

Everything simple solution black white. seen Star Wars? sick fuck almost month ending around October, hopefully ok time get vaccine probably September later? can't throw buzzword problem pretend solves complexities involved. Cloud computing useful powerful, would absolutely first go-to solution this. yet answered single question posed it? shoulders cost? burdens cloud server extremely high amount traffic? get compensation/incentive? mention dozens logistical questions posed technical issues still great answer either. 

I'm trying say can't done, I'm pointing simple ""I could set google form can't guvment"" Microbiology Immunology go hand hand, microbes cause disease trigger immune response manipulate immune system infection cells. Microbiology study cells core.  immunology interaction cells. 

All know work series microbiologists, none ever specialized immunology, grasp concepts perfectly education microbiologists.  Anyone PhD microbiology going strong grasp concepts. I'm American knew meant kid, also pretty good education read lot. I'd curious know ""average"" American knows not. Ok fair point. thinking staff residents vaccinated herd bubble. whole staff go home still get bring spread part, less likely enhanced protection complete immunity. Looks like USA spreading virus fast enough. Time accelerate again! Superbowl Feb 7th. wait guarantee Oxford/ Astrazeneca (or Novavax finishes trials approved TGA manufactured time). Australia limited supply Pfizer first approved administered risk groups.
So basically I'm saying kid kinda choice vaccines. likely get get. faith given Australia's current situation, TGA medical bodies cut corners rush approval without considering risk groups yourself. group 10 people. gleeful shot Georgia flipping, slightly hysterical panic onset possible civil war. emotional 15 minutes comradery.

Or say couple drinks? referring western countries. countries never get vaccine don‚Äôt care either way. Microbiology always human body. lot microbiologists never medical courses. even human body, microbiologists formal education immunology might go beyond undergraduate course, especially since research nowadays highly niche go decades researching micro-organisms without deal immunology again.

Also immunology subset microbiology. They're completely different field may interact medical microbiology depending research specialty researcher. think anyone saying remdesivir. reduced recovery time moderate cases. It‚Äôs profitable way one (honestly don‚Äôt actual view question) people say fake might trolling. niece boyfriend actually think virus exist joking it?

Its certainly possible come across people think virus exist. Supposedly also people think earth flat world run lizard people. think large enough fraction population make difference. treatment save 24% people dying? obviously preventing damage hospitalization.

If treatment prevent death, prevent damage organs well, mechanism.

That's really absurd... media great job saturating us Covid restrictions California model rest country. add state can't help healthcare workers. Every healthcare worker know NC FL got last 2 weeks...pretty much questions asked. wife RN 50% works refusing now. Circulating antibodies necessary immunity. Hi! someone who‚Äôs covid already almost 10 months ago plan getting vaccine eventually, im trying dispute claims thread sharin story, took antibody test 4-5 months infection didnt enough antibodies anymore im sure im somehow somewhat protected i‚Äôd rather safe sorry not, dont want risk sick covid again, kicked butt long hauling issues it. BUT, plan waiting people higher priority get way me, im thinking sometime summer next winter point hopefully ‚Äúremaining‚Äù people need herd immunity. I‚Äôd rather rich person buy take vaccine hesitant nurse letting dose sit fridge weeks. Famous last words. phased deployment distribute rapidly possible many people possible. ridiculous benefits they‚Äôre trying marginal best.

To 65s? Sure, let rip.

I think bunch healthy 20-somethings need ahead group real risk dying this. cubic shit tonne... Thanks can't even administer ones far better terms efficacy.

We can't administer hospitals incompetently run administrators showing sense urgency. becomes available CVS Walgreens, we'll start actually see real distribution.

And I'm sure lots people would rather take less efficacious vaccine wait May get one. also think we're probably gonna see another Covid stimulus relatively quickly Biden takes office (ie $2000 checks promised) Senate wins. that, least state local aid. I'd imagine new stimulus would include fuckload vaccine money solve issue given much current administration (rightly) criticized it. Personally hope make sure every 65 offered single healthy non-healthcare person gets it. They're gonna take meds bloody Huns. WWII, all, would like losing WWIII.

/s, case. I'm German. Honest it‚Äôs much better putting shit like plain language people. Couple years, yerp  Sharing caring, something like that. take 6 hrs remove itü§£ü§£ü§£ Bust say wiener made life severe reactions bad enough second doses childhood vaccines required adjustment. 

Also, read threads reddit. think unrealistic plan for. even get low grade fever 100 can't pass door check get job. aunt POA Lee County informed appointments. try take aspirin Tylenol I‚Äôm ill? resist urge buy Microsoft products, known side effect, lol. 2018 year really came through. Staycation means people driving around unfamiliar places two lane country roads. It‚Äôs anti-vaxxers....it‚Äôs people concerned it‚Äôs brand new created fast. also thought vast majority healthy people 60 aren‚Äôt getting sick anyway. opinions way, I‚Äôm getting shot tomorrow:) They‚Äôd right pace steadily rising. Good shit good shit. In'N'Out year. It'd worth it. think stat pretty pointless. like we've reached bottleneck distribution capacity. issue limited supply trying administer good. Yes, also know people getting second doses week too, ""total vaccinations"" increased.  like point. follow couple science type pages Facebook. People comments normally advocate questioning you‚Äôre presented critically thinking. However anyone tries ask fairly sensible questions vaccine they‚Äôll often get shut roasted, getting called Karens, tinfoil hats, etc. Except perhaps case immune-compromised patient, think generally ruled (1) people able clear viruses (test negative PCR) week two and, (2) least cases reinfection genetically analyzed confirmed distinct genotypes (i.e., second infection clearly caused new 'version' virus simply re-emergence original virus).  Since there's evidence reinfection second genotype evidence virus hangs bodies reemerges, reinfections seen almost certainly reinfections rather recurrences. (Many reinfections also coincide new exposures) R0 1 instance conservative assumption, it‚Äôs opposite mentioned virologist elsewhere, verify us? FWIW also think memory cells important factor. Good, getting somewhere. Brave admit particular source fluke. would also recommend watching 3rd 4th quarter comes up. bet it‚Äôs going come different. There‚Äôs threats strikes etc...but that‚Äôs hardly news, country, doesn‚Äôt much covid. disease burden far quite managable Finland Norway due test-trace early interventions, well disappearance flu.

As 6-12 case load compared neighbours end. That‚Äôs guesstimate, close far. Denmark downturn yes, 1:3.5 ratio compared Sweden, se wait till end see plays out. expect cases drop new measures, Sweden‚Äôs curve go straight enough vaccines place. 

As predictions, hit quite close mark I‚Äôd say. many predicted badly situation would get Sweden back april-may. mean yes also can't deny speeding up. people vaccinated yesterday first week. [Covid-19 rolling 7-day average vaccinations per day interested carry water, learn value every drop assumes 0% population transmitted 6% population- words, happened may anti-vaxxers, sure are. Healthcare workers need follow science. duty. healthcare positions profession job, need healthcare professional every sense profession. Without reading, anything Corticosteroids like Flonase? switched antihistamines months ago Reinfection happens ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è understand continuum is? 

Pretend 100 people room. person center room throws splotch paint. Record many people paint clothes. take 25 people give plastic covers protect paint. less people paint splotches them. repeat experiment 50 people wearing plastic covers. Even less people paint splotches clothes. 

That continuum. Replace paint COVID plastic covers vaccine. Yes course bubonic plague UK 2017 managed eliminate measles even resurge. Surely least aim zero? We're island, insane aim zero initially. would people terrified bad thing? Millions dead already people still care. Seems like could advantageous stoke fear morons. death count factor it‚Äôs merit countries count same.

No means completely lose factor countries inherent causes patterns deaths diseases may prevalent countries compare with. 
Prevalence major risk factors covid-19 death differs countries Europe, example Denmark high rates certain deadly cancers alzheimer's disease compared thest Nordics. 

South Korea [10-30% excess deaths 85+ pop following rapidly aging population. 

[Australia 338 excess deaths dementia spring 
Deaths pneumonia, diabetes respiratory disease also elevated 4 weeks, since baseline.

Using excess mortality every countries predictable baseline mortality based years data.

So agree, even understand means:

*For Sweden count seem resemble excess death would expect due causes death decreasing well.*

if covid-19 replaces influenza cause death, flu season covid season, mean one less death happens. find source another cause death decreasing *frequency*, actually happening less, I'd understand. Agreed. one seems take consideration kids pass virus family members. 

One students got covid someone volleyball team. relatively fine (lost taste smell, fever well enough attend virtual classes) passed mom, hospital week breathe (was oxygen). work state Forensic Mental Health facility. hospital allocated certain number doses began vaccine distribution level care staff starting last week. 

After week half, still enough doses left get shot. made appointment get vaccinated yesterday distribution center almost empty. could walked place wanted to. work home 95% time expecting receiving dose early wasn‚Äôt going turn golden opportunity.

I don‚Äôt know much vaccine allotted, know many front line staff refused shot someone like able get vaccine, lot staff must refused. video feeds online parking lots. one feed depended one line. stated, Israeli (Jewish presume) lines long, lines Arab areas short many people there. remember keep wearing mask need time stuff get body month. vaccinated twenty percent population- Individuals 60- deaths would go 80%.

This statement needs qualification.

If *had* vaccinated 100% people US 60, *100% effective* vaccine, *July*, *would have* seen 80% fewer deaths. 

Vaccine effectiveness, distribution, effect transmission, changes inherent growth higher level infection currently US -- factors chip away notion. long many people refusing it, fuck prioritizing. want one, get line get one. Nobody needs treated ‚Äúspecial‚Äù amount ignorance present. feel though strengthens point, thank additional information. fewer nurses far cases covid, hardly imagine strain staff.


That said, think statistics like bit overly simplistic ""nurses"" pretty heterogeneous group. link source additional info regarding level training considered nurse hospital setting settings?

You‚Äôre wrong - one needs nonsense you‚Äôre babbling That‚Äôs included. Thanks. like this.  often one say wiener saved life. Hello,

Monday afternoon started developing cough. history chronic coughs every year due post-nasal drip caused allergies. doctor told last year allergies flared take Claritin. I‚Äôve taking daily Claritin every day since Monday cough seems get better it. symptoms. fever, loss taste smell. matters I‚Äôm also pregnant. plan go get tested today case. Here‚Äôs question: work preschool. haven‚Äôt known suspected covid cases months. haven‚Äôt really participated social events partner‚Äôs immediate family (who live with), times mom masks worn. go store occasionally try best follow safety guidelines. ease mind, likely allergies flaring up? adamant job need stay home get test results? r/collapse/ forms database fairly straightforward I'd think states would willing share db structure forms other. means states forms either money/infrastructure/staff implement website, think they'll get around something like later ""when becomes necessary"", they're planning ""letting market handle it"".

""Letting market handle it"" obviously *terrible* idea, least ethics perspective. guess rich political donor, great idea. ones capable yet probably hoping get money feds implement it.

Its ones ""well, let's later, *really* need it"" bother me. They're looking implementation tool, incredibly helpful planning tool well. lets know many people area interested getting vaccinated, much risk people. there's cluster high-risk people close together, easy plan vaccination day five there.

You play around numbers well: know case 1000 Pfizer vaccines headed one location 900 high-priority people live/work there, bring high-priority people live near-*ish*, rope slightly less high-priority people might still above-average risk. spare doses might go waste, run database see lives nearby drop text: ""Please respond Y/N message: get this-time today vaxxed? Please note: respond message within 15 minutes, we'll give slot next person list.""

And finally, setting database early means instability comes everyone tries sign happens actually need system. also ability clean data necessary handle issues come up. Then, finally time database put use, nice clean stable, huge strain.

I wish states something like running. I'm sure there's things going general public know fear Panic hysteria. mid late March J&amp;J approval fast-tracked distribution picks considerably. 

more likely middle april. definitely something lot vaccines. procedure dip vial fresh syringe - double dip anything that's used. likely received multiple vaccines life multi-use vial. long loss smell typically last? Seeing lots commenters saying still havent gotten sense smell back months later. Wondering median experience permanent loss, prolonged (but permanent) loss, rather short loss. get Janssen results CureVac data think. former already cut size enrollment trial confident hit required statistically relevant thresholds earlier virus rampant US UK. expect data single-dose trial mid-January mid-February. I'm Sarasota County tried every time sign parents. made Eventbrite waiting room informed minute two later yet sold out.

Its good selling out, sucks getting ticket worse scoring tickets overhyped rock concert. would love able sign notify time available rather attempt sign event every day so, would except day - 24/7.

Edit - using Eventbrite sign up.  method? mRNA? that's foolproof. adjusted, know process looks like, long take, long re-approval process take (or even looks like), distribution issues every time happens.

no reason ""chill"" way life effectively gone thing mutates benignity, may never happen I‚Äôm tired hearing Dr. Fauci. wrong virtually everything, fuck him. mom got email boss saying employees job eligible get vaccinated make appointment. mental healthcare provider working home since start pandemic currently school works plans bring department back office yet. 

she's New York Cuomo made crime skip line vaccines. would something would get trouble for? goal though? Encouraging. Administration-wise, that's 612,621 yesterday, biggest one-day jump far. Or, get booster shot years. Doubtful Pfizer going reduce price even produced nothing. Oxford vaccine non profit duration pandemic Ooohhhhh, can‚Äôt wait!!! comment post burden chief.

Los Angeles hospitals swamped.

&amp;#x200B;

Los Angeles ***400 miles away*** Bay Area. That's works. yes/no answer scientists guessing one right. ""Likely enough"" means vaccinated people protected, people protected new variant. Vaccine efficacy go down, zero. Keep mind vaccine trials completed, regulatory authorities would approved 50% efficacious vaccine. Maybe working already sick elderly. also much smaller population everyone 60 Dude looks like douchebag That‚Äôs lot less one million per day. That‚Äôs abysmal Data trackers allowed r/coronavirus. One post high-quality news source posted significant international, national regional landmark. wish covid article wasnt stating obvious. Hi. would like add, living living aid community? ask two questions two answers. 
 living you? consider bigger picture avoid risk aid you! Ignore vaccines risk probable gain from. 
 living community greater good? concerned sister, brother, mother, father, sister law, brother law, best friend childhood, best friend childhoods mother, would miss talking piazza man makes stumble home pizza Friday night beers? give F anyone else yes take vaccine. 
 opinion vaccines good everyone can, one. I'm saying one million chance causing trouble grand schemes things including virus like mumps, measles, rubella, polio, vaccines way forward. Think this, forgetting used wards people confined iron lungs polio (which close made non existence vaccines) measles vaccines women think aborting pregnancies outbreak measles occurred neighbouring area.  recently heard women discussing abortions measles outbreaks areas near including themselves? Give year?
 still doubt vaccines quote sources say bad mislead. credible sources say vaccines bad, supposed ""documentaries"" like made chiropractors non medical people hoping gaining monetary gain celebrity promoting false agenda. Last heard medical staff making national average wages, seems little capitalist me. hyperjump conclusions. Absolutely. makes sense vaccinate healthcare workers (because interact older sicker people nearly constantly).

It makes sense vaccinate 65+.

Yet vaccination process gone like this

1) Send vaccines hospitals vaccinate healthcare workers. half refuse vaccine, hospitals tons doses hands. People sort sit around knowing they're allowed move phase 1B. Also vaccinate staff.

2) states vaccinate people 75+, availability community still pretty low despite tons vaccines distributed, they're sitting hospital freezers.

3) Argue essential workers go first vaccines prioritize 25 year olds positions well represented local unions older Americans.

We've prioritized least 50 million people far ahead general public 65+. Getting people difficult confusing, failing available lower priority groups political consequences.

I really wish they'd healthcare workers reverse age. live county full anti-maskers. Come in, water's fine! 200 days small window now. going let unvaccinated people enter country? rate vaccination slow. cheap presumably better tax structure people coming from. said uhaul great indicator - millionaires flocking Florida certainly using Uhaul. r/coronavirus users twisting pretzel knots basically say: ""Gimme vaccine, grandma wait"" impression got covid recovered immune. anaphylaxis life threatening. Patients told watch medical care easily rapidly treated. Nay. mean, that's best info far, ultimately, study 17 recovered Covid patients, vaccinated people. immediate finding there's lot disparity different people. people (mainly) make antibodies epitopes mutated South African variant, will. whose response focused epitope that's mutated, there's loss recognition all.

I think scientist expecting would all-or-nothing response vaccine vs SA variant. Efficacy probably reduced, much, point necessary deploy modified vaccine? Also spread allergic reactions people potentially kill them. ... savings account, must use vaccine accumulates much. think typo. 0.8% much closer every estimate seen.

However, young 0.08% could fair guess. it‚Äôs 89% instead 95%? Anything 49% win vaccine talk started April anyone know there‚Äôs evidence totally immune covid? mean like affect showing tests body blocks/defends So, Super Duper COVID then. fauci think Biden suddenly haven‚Äôt even come close projections thus far. Biden magic ticket fauci wrong right. Huh, utterly shocking would happen Florida places, paragon data transparency forthrightness.   


(lived Florida 50+ years, hopefully soon gone) gotta wait update via 5G, Gates currently slow releasing updates. thing certainly see germs, insane thought process personal fear disability beat death. Car accidents, wars tend leave 2 4 x alive seriously disabled life. feel beating virus may simular ( long term affects seems ligit?

My point death part ongoing tragedy. recovered released home.  100%. Almost positive strain ravaging Los Angeles UK-identified variant. mean guy told us masks useless protecting virus?  believed deadly. transmissible. Maybe best thing write someone day 8. ""nurse says shutdowns anything. Open 'er up, boys"" understand numbers real, good job look like China lies Happy cake day! South African super-covid similar worse. important distinguish them. Also, important remain scientifically neutral. *but drop bucket terms getting us closer herd immunity*

We need stop deaths, stop virus altogether. 60+ year olds vaccinated, done COVID IFR drop around 0.1% hospitals overflowing matter what. Unfortunately don‚Äôt think rely that, UK places work, non- essential shops, pubs / restaurants etc shutdown people working remotely. 

However, schools open children permitted mingle shutting schools impacted kids also essential services key workers require childcare. 

Schools shut since Christmas won‚Äôt reopen April get better data compare infectivity rates different age groups they‚Äôre equivalent lockdowns People twist pretzel knots point. getting silly.

This 'respect', ending mass death return normal.

The group highest risk death get low-risk 20, 30 40-something healthcare workers. wanker point make sense. dont want forbid people getting vaccine prioritize access it, sooner get it, safer are. really agree views ethic reasons, technically stupid decision all. Eye opening one way put it...

It‚Äôs absurd.

Lockdowns slow spread disease less people dying net them. 

 lockdowns stop people would otherwise act normally, many people aren‚Äôt going go pandemic.

Especially QR code verify vaccinations. PNA chose get vaccines, actually secretely receive Israeli vaccines too.  want zombies lol It‚Äôs pretty straightforward though: vaccinating healthcare workers enables keep working save way lives one vaccine would save 75 year old. Moderna apparently ready back March. unfortunately tests make sure they're safe. retrospect, sure, would loved shots doled then, can't without safety. Former EMT, current Covid ICU RN here. rationing oxygen means case us (hospital staff) EMS going clinical presentation regards oxygenation part. There's magic number really go ""oxygen saturation"". Sa02 Pa02 looked trying oxygenate patients adequately. look clinical picture patient, things like work breathing mostly. patients fail improve oxygen increase flow rate try different modalities like high flow nasal oxygen non-invasive ventilation (Bi-PAP machines) intubating. different types oxygenation look determine much needed. many Covid cases, Sa02 reading 83-88% may fine they're short breath. ideal, patients stable evidenced low arterial C02 adequate arterial 02 improvement signs/symptoms. (For record- Sa02 amount oxygen bound hemoglobin transports oxygen molecules tissues usually people refer ""oxygen saturation"". Pa02 amount oxygen dissolved arterial blood could readily available). said, complicated issue. Current practice allowing patients remain low oxygen readings long stable statement mostly correct. need ration resources levels right now. EMS, pretty much everyone got least oxygen benign modality. policy way years Los Angeles we've never needed ration reinforcing existing policy. TLDR: we're allowing oxygen levels lower normal patients stable. quality ways we're delivering same. need more, get more. died 15 days receiving single vaccine dose, reason never thought vaccine side effect. 

Give vaccine millions people going coincidental deaths follow month. almost certainly nothing vaccine. 

Of course, logical good they're investigating definitively rule out. people see headline concerned. like injected dropped dead chair. fine living country like russia?

When members congress talking floor though difference clear. republicans straight took masks, left nose hanging out. One even went diaper chin approach. 

Most keep mask whole time, painfully obvious see ones (mostly republicans) obviously never wear mask outside forced like yesterday. talking masks coming off, uncomfortable - obvious never actually wear mask even one fits right. Oddly that's bad number everyone else gets it, would accomplish herd immunity along fact people already virus, fact, saying right wrong   excuse.....not remotely. make difference life end day. seems like appropriate way manage distribution.

from price list vaccines country, Sinopharm actually one expensive ones lol don‚Äôt think u say rich countries afford vaccines sarilumab already added government's export restriction list, bans companies buying medicines meant UK patients selling higher price another country.  

Yay, boo kinda hard go restaurants gym closed think? Also, police enter homes give fines people gathering.

But right people respecting rules, prohibition war drug worked well.  correct, substantial change spike protein could render vaccine ineffective. I'd say unlikely changes might make difficult virus bind cell receptors impossible.

Sounds like op read article understand tbh. pretty sure mandatory unpaid leave considered constructive dismissal legal liability firing them. Hopefully cause problems future. 

If congress would focus removing liability companies requiring vaccine I'm familiar place type. parents retired central Fla. many years ago.  spent many weeks living places visiting.

My point simply nothing inherent design would make virus-resistant. may large percentage tend stay home national average, always number hit buffet three towns over. means exceptionally good job. necessarily. variant South Africa looks even dangerous, may evolved relatively strong population immunity 30-40% there. vague hint one mutation may weakened far mutations experts worried puzzled significantly increased R. know what's reported, also know countries different criteria included official statistics. also know poorer countries often infrastructure required good statistics, countries even actively fiddle data make look better.

Like, y'all started looking planning distribution in, say, August??

I know planning done re: transporting vaccine super cold state. mean beyond that. places planning things got punted line individual health care centers whatnot kinda busy trying help keep ppl alive. 7 day moving average 2742, record set last month. 

We see number keeps going up, thats number really want watch single day totals jump high next day go fairly low trying get vaccine 1.5 weeks wife 1B. appointments available. I'm Israeli, started 60+ healthcare workers, last week vaccinating anyone risk, next going vaccinate teachers. Two pictures, day, different men. error behalf newspaper. Go China! care solutions come from, end mess many people age 60-70 (my mother included) interest getting vaccine even though turn trust never 100% - hope that's based least dozen severe cases control group. 
Otherwise, overall reduction one fifth might mask true severe-case efficacy.

Moderna 30 zero, one two severe cases expected overall efficacy.

But indicated theory animal trials, vaccines mostly protect lung, endothelial non-surface tissue, severe-disease efficacy could much better overall efficacy.  area closed businesses sell food, beverages, tools/parts, electronics. Hallmark stores allowed stay open sold candy. tocilizumab sarilumab Jesus lmao Exactly this. 
Sorry misunderstandings sloppy wording... morning person :/ Didn‚Äôt get vaccinated ? US?? Pfff, dude street fighter 2 could. Epic failure. implies there‚Äôs people better us. 

The United States isn‚Äôt best everything. Enough irrelevant hyperbole shows hand. Israel kicking worlds ass. European country gold standard United States following right now.

I suspect eventually annual bi-annual vaccine. also suspect time goes develop single vaccine dose probably even vaccine stored room temperature several days. Good know, thanks least black people excuse. heard US UK vaccines less effective black Asian populations. MIT report said 90% black Asian recipients develop antibodies, opposed 99.5% Caucasian recipients.

Actually, women might adverse outcomes too. 99% pharmaceuticals vaccines never tested women People Color. Almost everything comes US, UK, Russia tested white men. Perfect, look forward Hmmm.

Here Australia think sequence *every* case, many target. God gonna over. actually can't take anymore Targeting certain groups works there‚Äôs actually way control spread. since it‚Äôs totally control everywhere, makes sense simply jab anyone everyone fast possible. Seriously can‚Äôt believe country bad this. always minor discrepancies data sources US. commonly due discrepancies county state data, differences reporting window (Worldometer uses midnight midnight GMT instance), differences include backlogs.

Well, pedantry goal (and that's always bad thing), one point SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 actually interchangeable. former refer virus itself. latter refers disease virus causes. like distinction HIV virus disease AIDS. 

The distinction two matters LOT comes HIV (since people go many years develop AIDS, ever), less COVID-19, especially since asymptomatic spread (not confused pre-symptomatic spread) considered incredibly rare even nonexistent. 

Back pedantry: Since Chinese/Wuhan coronavirus predates COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2, still think make blanket claim. However, true practically speaking that, given wide prevalence COVID-19 synonymousness virus itself, likely almost everyone says something along lines China virus choosing assert value judgement instead simply using first label heard.

And yet.. COVID-19 conscious value judgement opposite direction. Regardless people's intentions using label, precisely is. *explicitly* said people use names tied geographic locations (though repeated re: UK strain, knowledge.) relatives, 45, Israel vaccinated. average, average whole period someone infectious. people managing infect 8 others hours. it‚Äôs almost like big corporations running everything terrible! high heartrate whole time. heartrate go 90bpm 24 hours lying motionless. watch freaking 'abnormal heartrate detected' time. average resting heart rate amazing like 60s normally seeing heart rate remained high even sleeping scariest thing me. wonder kills people heart problems.

Week 12/10 = +59%

I think statistic 12/24 week bit cherry picked implication headline really supported recent data.  think given CVS Walgreens locations around country well massive stadiums universities converted vaccination outlets.

CVS Walgreens already part clusterfuck. They‚Äôre responsible administering vaccine lot long term care facilities, they‚Äôre failing get job done right alongside hospitals. 

There mass vaccination sites future, don‚Äôt enough doses available justify right now. think signals ""when crowded place wear mask"", easily signal ""when crowded place outside specific hours, wear mask"".

If rules simple, people follow them. people pride much trust government, Swedes seem concerned get people follow rules. Whose political reasons pushed for? German? British? American? Israeli? Chinese? see make much sense. wary vaccine luckily take it. locked area? Around me, everything closed except hardware stores, drive thru windows, grocery stores. Drugstores, sell stop-smoking aide. sure read directions chew it; pop mouth chomp away like regular gum  Yet PHE wants sundays no-one gets vaccinated days... Sure staffing remains challenge even regular hospitals. 

I first-hand knowledge hospital/region Canada, even moderate degree outbreak tight nursing staff. Due local nursing home outbreaks hospital taken management floated nurses wards/ER. result we've cut lot elective procedures, even ones require admission (ex. Endoscopy), free nurses work settings.

We could second hospital magically appear next door ability care twice people.

Over Christmas ICU full another 40% overflow ER acute care beds. ICU nurses solely responsible patients would worse 1:3 nurse patient ratio, instead ER nurses occupied overflow patients ICU 1:2 still suboptimal ICU. lead delayed care ER patients, longer waits etc. think anyone harmed meaningful way due effective triaging, definitely suboptimal.

I share experience anecdotally exemplify challenge staffing moreso space. Certainly push ratios use PSWs/RPNs designations ""lower trained"" HCWs management RNs MDs, ideal feel strain forced this. I'm confident hospital capacity keep stretching forced, think space make particularly easier. work airport shuttle pilots airport hotels. Florida pilots love brag Florida restrictions lowest cases... new strain? access antibody production decay participants trials. Boohoo Many? worry Americans measured quality life based 1%. That‚Äôs countries measure well-being. Canada strive ensure largest swath population possible cared living well. 

I would say enjoying gains lifetime you‚Äôre living extreme capitalist hellscape rich feed poor. 100%. 

They need hand medical providers. Give X amount vaccines network. contact patients set slots vaccinate, obviously vetting person interested willing come in. bet could easily manage schedule 10 minute windows come 5-10 people facilities start cranking whatever allocation have. 

Right showing people's places work finding folks still want it. need somehow leverage eager poked somehow schedule get one. meant recommended outside rush hour too. Thank much this, really detailed description! 

I suppose I‚Äôd consider sleeping symptom since provoked immune response, maybe sleep kept feeling worse flu. Immune function runs higher sleep. Why? That‚Äôs nice. many people want it? many doses available? practice nobody follow rules. seen months sweden. surprised normal life sweden. People go supermarkets, take bus, total normality.

Now recommend masks rush hour reality people follow. hope someone makes videos everybody see it. ever bus? Good air circulation description would use. Exactly says.

That may make vaccines less effective. Less =/= useless. common sense tingling . benefits distributing every single vaccine day got would negligible. We‚Äôd gone around 14% country immune 20%. Great people got it, something that‚Äôs going change course pandemic. 

If want doses hand make kind difference course pandemic, you‚Äôre going get people benefit most. severe illness coronavirus continue set new records almost every day, especially South West. Arizona, California Nevada exceptionally bad shape ‚Äî 30% hospital beds state filled coronavirus patients. people sick enough warrant hospital stay patients risk dying virus. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

People paying tens thousands dollars skip line, we're talking super rich, super smart people trying really hard find hospital ""donate"" to, get vaccine maybe month two earlier. UK South African variants immunity rate sustain herd immunity high 80s low 90s (without restrictions). Possible, unlikely. antibodies coronaviruses last months, year best. Chances reinfection high, odds improving dramatically time. reason, even previously may infected, recommended get vaccines. read article state believe trying complete roll rural hospitals medical staff ton people complying get - moving on.

I'm hoping begin roll next phases they've made honest good faith attempts coverage group - let people want receive one go. Hand medical networks begin contacting patients judge interest schedule appointment come in. 

Naturally I'm talking probably March April nursing home efforts efforts roll front line worker places business done. think major issue show grocery store police department 500 doses guarantee staff going accept take one. eventually need start offering wider group certainly us want start moving needle getting population covered. live sweden far seen change. Age yes. Put CVS's let anyone 65+ line up.

But categorizing frontline worker category X, Y, Z what's causing delays. Nothing old English it. incredibly common. quick search yielded one, looks like paid $30 per dose US paid $19 EU allegedly even less (since funded BioNTech) unlikely ‚ÄúSpanish Flu‚Äù originated Spain, scientists still unsure source. France, China Britain suggested potential birthplace virus, United States, first known case reported military base Kansas March 11, 1918.
What find fascinating time world travel difficult still managed span globe. Scary stuff. fewer restrictions harsher restrictions quell pandemic beginning. talking restrictions summer replying statement death rates? *cries American* conclude protests summer cause outbreaks? makes one different? I'm sarcastic people thread want dumb everything treat people like children can't read clock. Probably, likely sort important detail fully understand, something like ""there must gap exposure least x time every years"". cases deaths. People likely comply treated like adults, see rules implemented restraint respect.  Thanks. explains it. 

Regarding gene dropout, cases gene dropout indicative B.1.1.7 variant could also indicate variants? think career based prioritization.

It‚Äôs not. 

It‚Äôs harder announce vaccine available healthcare workers announce vaccine available anyone. It‚Äôs hard box people check make appointment asking occupation is. It‚Äôs harder ask people show work ID check appointment ask regular ID insurance info (which happen anyway- need able track who‚Äôs getting shots). 

We‚Äôve running mass Covid testing sites months earlier days many limited certain professions, ages symptoms. say confidently someone worked checking make sure people showed belonged never slowest part it. Last March, knew use masks, got sick slight fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue. (I work essential retail store come contact lot people). mild. bit shortness breath laid stomach sleep. honestly know virus. bit early allergy season took store-brand antihistamine case allergies. testing available area unless severe symptoms. stayed home work rested.

My symptoms kind mild persistent. went away days antihistamines ibuprofen. persisted took antihistamines. chalked early allergies time thought weird still lots snow ground allergies pollen-related.

Weird thing was, daughter slight fever ~2 weeks me. Nothing alarming...we lockdown left house think virus. gave ibuprofen fever went away day. Then, developed spot-like rashes torso ~4 weeks 2-day fever. baffled time connect fever fever happened several weeks (I know rashes often seen kids MIS-C). 

I went nuts thinking could cause weird spot-like rashes (it almost looked like measles something). went house looking evidence mites, fleas, bed bugs...because rashes seemed come nowhere. baffled time bc info MIS-C. knew covid time pneumonia.

I think might brought low-ish viral load home work last March way confirm time. 30,000 people either vaccine months part trials. suddenly stop vaccine, still part trial, they're still watched. side effect found, we'd found already. Yeah, Prime Minister (head country) said, last week, rush lmao. 

Were good position, could much better get vaccine out, lower cases even protect vulnerable.  can't go store? Wait, let private sector vaccinations US? Uhm.. immunity vaccine fades time (it unknown whether case, expected last least years), presumably exposure virus would act sort booster shot. cares Florida. much better california without lockdown. agree. Cant believe looks like Florida got something right, are. like Simon says everyone government opposite? don‚Äôt think obvious wouldn‚Äôt work start. weeks ago everyone seemed agreement way go, think states going start pivoting Great information, thanks! Totally agreed expansion. think new strain(s) really going expand infection rates painful ways next couple months. CA still higher numbers Florida. You‚Äôre never going get med school flawed thinking like that. better educate better. 

The fact friend runs clinical trials Gilead talking peers last days. think it‚Äôs obviously adverse reaction vaccine, don‚Äôt believe government going pull vaccine. Rashes common side effect especially Moderna vaccine death like would normally stop clinical trial. 

He said regular drug, would likely get pulled, he‚Äôs happen drug working on. One person died completely stopped study. circumstances different likely won‚Äôt change rollout unless happens more. one saying get infected, OP saying natural immunity factor getting closer herd immunity.

So people already infected somewhat factor getting closer herd immunity.

It undeniable unless something new trigger antibodies infection. give example scummy end business - 

A friend album, band moderately successful, looked like may take while. got publishing advance first album, publisher suggested keep touch another deal second album, send sketches compositions meantime could advise. second album released, said ""yeah, second album publishing deal... well already rights tracks sketches sent in...so give anything"" (contractually right, apparently).

He left music industry. fucks care artists, land-grab, that's all. Well, Florida better California currently. Although terribly stupid comparison. know serious, would watch show. KEKW.

Mass confusion business hours implemented across country, citizens left confused hungry unsure go store. Despite sub would imply Florida currently LESS cases US average. state approaching herd immunity would North Dakota twice many cases.  mean said UK people know means website UK website addressed UK citizens, see anything wrong here. Yep, did. Please elaborate ""every expert"" agrees him. Experts recommend get infected all... Naturally acquired protection polio generally results loss nerve function. Experts generally recommend exposure polio all.

Because, I've said elsewhere. every single host gets infected, virus acquiring changes. insignificant, lead nowhere, might make another generation. might even mean anything hundreds generations line, suddenly, random mutation host makes useful. instance, might suddenly change spike protein, means immune system longer recognize old protein, means everyone already infected beer infected again, even worse, since vaccine effort relies teaching immune system recognize protein, means vaccine efforts go completely vain like need start over. new spike protein closely resembles normal protein bodies need, like hrh1 (histamine) oxytocin, involved vasoconstriction blood pressure regulation? Now, virus becomes deadlier, worse vaccines might produce could make body react chemicals need survive. Yeah one 50 died covid... think provinces slightly holding back wanted make sure 2nd round doses hand people, yesterday Trudeau called poor rollout theres little bit ""ok, fuck you"" mentality cause they're ramping way up, Ontario pace run 6 days. think week issue gonna flip province's rollout feds getting enough shipped in. Exactly, Biontech CEO said Pfizer helpful getting regulatory approval setting trials different countries. Without would taken longer. Biontech Curevac innovative start-ups international network affiliated companies branch offices around world big players have. Israeli here. Lockdowns hurt us much nobody really gives much shit, still see friends. work statistically, people hurt small businesses. true. reported one possible allergy reaction per thousand immunized people still curious figure out? 4,000 people died COVID US yesterday. tell sure, less 4,000 day death rate. public health experts say positivity rate less 5 % means resume normal activities low chances spread. I'm scientist that's you. like we're save 3 people day. think US pretty much done first-rate country.

1,375,000 doses shipped Texas ""more 475,000"" gotten injection.

If every one 475k (and that's big fucking if) gotten doses, that's around million doses. I'll give reporting lag million (again, feels generous easy math.)  hell couple million? fairness... people deserve make informed decision based vaccine trial results, ask questions based latest info. old doesn‚Äôt mean guardian give up.

I‚Äôm 100% board vaccine, asked sign months ago one parents, I‚Äôd admittedly hesitate ethically that‚Äôs questionable authorize someone based little info.

With today‚Äôs info, that‚Äôs totally different topic. I‚Äôd give believe data proved it‚Äôs safe effective. would unethical vaccinate IMHO. Realistic what? never claimed anything.  we're going let everyone else achieve natural immunity? Screw that! would risk getting long covid vaccines exist?! Also letting virus still run significant part population opens opportunity mutations already know ends... Feel better. dont fever feel like I've overheating. feeling nauseous morning walked outside cold immediately felt better.  It‚Äôs indicator. time data needed know sure. 

However, get flu shot every year. generally need boosters vaccines, although usually 10 year increment. it‚Äôs unheard people need revaccinate protect disease. honestly care extra doses go donors rich people, 70% supply used, need correct that. part reason strict prioritization time go even means people get order. ""I want one needed statistical massage get 62% likely work rather ones straightforward 90% better results!"" measure level immune response rate decay certain markers like antibodies memory cells try project forward comparing progression acquired immunities, seems CEO talking here. difficult know certain without direct observation x% people x-measure immune response get symptomatic illness, severity it. Why? excluded high level education (like blacks women) intentionally believing fake news (like conservatives) direct result lack understanding Science. 

It's like everywhere World. see anti-vax movements fuel fake news lack education. Ugh, ‚Äòmetal zone‚Äô version? shit show. anyone get little nervous multi dose vials. know nurses trained sterile practice something they've practiced anywhere else, dipping vial multiple times multiple patients? good enough slow vaccinating I'm getting hopes up. clearly worried getting another shipment time. get pretty clear going scarcity doses.

I think that's pretty clearly what's happening. good news holding back 2nd dose essentially stop issue time goes by.

I think hospitals stop it, stop impacting supply, older 2nd doses start distributed. Essentially, baseline holdback built distributed refilled new stock.

I think particularly good policy, cause 50% future shipments used - or, phrased better, 50% shipments used, portion used offset 50% prior shipments released.

We able match shipments vaccinations soon. could different story couple weeks

Not mention covid+ around corner. reads like Plague Inc headline know shit's bad SF gets hit.  hi! wondering got statistics from? want share want make sure providing reliable info them! too! stop smiling got building entertaining explanations, watch Anime ""Cells Work"" ridiculous. practice number new cases r*x r constant x number infected. little better model would r * x - * already it. Next complication start modeling spreads based population contact/movment. rollout confusing...but confusing due fact enough supply meet demand. Got it.

Seems pretty straightforward me. Houston Laredo (and surrounding cities) opening waiting lists extra vaccines. know county outside Houston openings week, they're filled quick. folks (my neighbors) directly contacted primary doctor schedule vaccination. neighbor directly across street gets next tuesday (65+ y/o diabetes). I'm talking people names. Someone called Joseph Biden could neighbour (probably 300 years old - fact reason Senators seem traditionally English names) 

But Tyler's, Brooks', Val's, Trent's, Lacey's would never seen UK month Sundays. mean, voted leave EU. Right wrong, nationalism strong there. clearly willing risk death it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wonder myself! know one place NY happened; know used up. can't imagine fined, clinics using 'best judgement' extra doses, may see stories like Florida extra shots going donors, etc. pisses off. ""Here, States, take vaccines figure out. Good luck!""

As long live, never forgive Trump absolute clusterfuck made every little thing touched country. millions people supported enabled sorry ass. agree... America everything comes $$ moment unfortunately... polluting pieces shit allowed oceans anyway. noise vaccine good couple years? numbers reinfection rates? would give important context except active duty explicitly low-risk group, overweight older. get things take time could done weeks months ago. like vaccine sprung people 24 hours make plan. development months. That's true. bad correct point made there! everything read, military taking COVID seriously. Unlike commander chief. sure see time Miami-Dade appointments RIGHT NOW. Finally, sensible rules eradication. ‚ÄòIt impossible country deliver zero-Covid strategy. country world delivered that, including ones aimed it,‚Äô says. ‚ÄòCovid going here, going manageable risk.‚Äô focus fatalities and, says, abolishing restrictions soon feasible. ‚ÄòCovid going here, going manageable risk‚Äô Covid hospital cases fall pressure NHS lifted, says, ‚ÄòThat point look lift restrictions.‚Äô herd immunity, vaccinating many people virus dies out? ‚ÄòThe goal ensure vaccinate whole population point, vaccinate vulnerable‚Äù** primary goal vaccine preventing disease, infection. Among participants vaccinated, one developed severe COVID, developed mild COVID 78% less control group.  People stop eating junk.

It‚Äôs hard make hamburger taste much better. Except clinical trial single shot delayed second shot.  FDA gonna pull revised dosing approval ass something?   doctors go label? would definitely help lol! They'll probably drop found something else people click state one I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll contact me. people meeting December deaths yet, unless they're dying rapidly. *cases* reported first week December exposed infected end November. Yeah don't. completely sucked lol Oh definitely, think may misunderstanding one another. Lol. 

So basically test date clinics already. give us 3 clinics Pfizer shot (3rd clinic people unable didn‚Äôt get shot 1st clinic) that‚Äôs it. believe, regardless level participation, move next phase hit particular date. know.. surprised too.. remembered..

They even require scientific communication course PhD programs. took elective, took issue fact moreso writing class, less effective communication complex ideas! says move faster, wait 2 weeks determine went wrong...? think different definition urgency do. know kind database people want vaccine register scheduled receive it.

This one basic problems United States. federal government ceded responsibility states, states ceded responsibility individual counties many cases. parents list county, left hand fucking clue 500 right hands doing. It‚Äôs completely uncoordinated. Sources this? I've seen two...and they're person. I'm conflicted thing. got Flu shot NOV proceeded come flu Christmas. impact mRNA vaccine body fails prevent getting sick? [Looks like Nov-Dec pretty bad, Jan-March low highest numbers Congratulations!!! üëè Hopefully FDA far behind.  J&amp;J vaccine phase 3 single double shot versions. scratch? Google call phone number, keep hold, conversation person pick up, schedule appointment add calendar ultimately send reminders directions asking 1 question free speaker got survey 2 years ago. Pretty sure could handle it.

The government would make website since currently controlling distribution vaccine.

Thinking majority minority shortsighted. thinking vulnerable/less vulnerable. get point would love able run parallel simulations healthcare try stop people dying fast possible. 

Crudely, guy holding gun face (the virus), could disarm (vaccinate risk) get friends buy guns protect (vaccinate majority).

Now risk cared for. First come/first served appointments whatever make lot sense. Preassure guys probably insane. addition low death rate fact able make vaccine it, like AIDS example.

But yeah 2 factors worst illness terms pandemic. Extra doses distributed randomly, sometimes disposed of. States (or Federal Government) need organize list phone numbers people *want* vaccine, opt-in notification system. people could notified extra available; text reply availability, receive confirmation, go get dose. could organized tiers priority, using GPS data proximity. I've personally heard cases people affiliated hospitals got called last minute: lists going used soon. *will* no-shows. going problem coming months something organized soon. ""Pinch-Hitters Pandemic"". virus low individual risk high group risk. means single person unlikely die, likelihood many people die still incredibly high. Nobody catches covid expect die‚Äîbut everyone expect many people die. 

It‚Äôs somewhat paradoxical it‚Äôs part reason people underestimate risk. waiting older vaccine technology vs new mRNA understand.

The company using ‚Äòolder‚Äô technology Novavax. Oxford using andovirus vector deliver payload nucleus cell. new animals. Quite new humans. I‚Äôll take word it.

If thin 2-3 weeks Christmas - see things already getting worse hospitals now.

Duah actually think good idea, least 'decent' idea. older people it, get arms. person taken pool possible 'infected' one less vector virus, take away fast possible, spread slows. 'already infected' (which probably 40 million +) 1 million day vaccinated, summer lot dead ends virus. No, guideline geared towards people received antibody treatments. CDC states people may vaccinated soon they've recovered COVID Dear god yes please. friend county Texas said able join local waitlist general population. asked age, whether preexisting conditions would make high risk, profession. (She's mid 30's, high risk, customer facing). understand literally every county this. Please, someone explain why. Good Colorado. 

It‚Äôs interesting read difference messaging Colorado Florida (where live). Colorado‚Äôs website refers eligible people ‚ÄúColoradans‚Äù residents. 

Florida cares little Floridians messaging making clear anyone anywhere take supply allocated Floridians. 

Colorado seems leaders look people elected them. traffic deaths, accidents due alcohol, even heart attacks (well, beginning...) likely go activity drops. much factor make different story though, traffic death info showed. Staying home boring, marginally safer. Yet agree respiratory competing infections probably main cause.
You seem miss already wrote exactly that, answer rhetorical question. would mattered flu covid going around, others certainly did. 

The death count factor it‚Äôs merit countries count same. see excess deaths better measure countries test ignore large probable case loads covid. Sweden count seem resemble excess death would expect due causes death decreasing well. (Probably mainly less spread infections overall) agree? one suggesting that. Although seem fucked justifications. 10 years vs 2 years. 

My point exactly. This. like n fries, like well done. please stop conflating vaccine skepticism anti-vaxxism? one same. According vaccination rate (averaged 7 days) leveled 400,000 day, getting higher. People complaining vaccination rates week now, New Year's Eve week ago. 

It look good.   Got first dose end December due second end January. relief feel...it‚Äôs true. knowing makes feel ease patients (don‚Äôt get wrong, still take precautions never leave house unless it‚Äôs go hospital)...but feeling relief there. English worse British reporters say ""The number NEW cases rose quarter""? Without new interpret total rose quarter. Slow now--we always going continue see reinfection cases. idea they're still relatively rare become rarer result vaccine.

Is maybe early say explicitly mutation?  homeless pandemic?
I haven‚Äôt seen really anything them

The shelters No
I kiss though Yeah certainly fucking actually compare lockdowns done unimaginable amounts small businesses, education, mental health.

We‚Äôre talking difference thousand total. 20-40 million. Median age deaths 80, not? Low-key hoping Israel vaccinates everyone coming weeks. would light fire ass rest. Longer J&amp;J approved February, floodgates properly opened. demand outpace supply IMO. pandemic relief getting, stocks basically recovered insane degree.... Oh Wells MErIcA DeSantis always focused metric ""sales tax"" everything else. give shit anything bringing tourists pay ridiculously unsustainable tax system Florida place. refused lockdown, suppressed case numbers, Disney World opened back up, he's generous vaccines. give shit protecting people, ploy make money. No, not. I've seen countless studies showing mRNA vaccines stable strains (so far) odds new strain violent enough able surpass vaccine astronomically low. Dad sick he‚Äôs country :(
I wish could get real working vaccine help We're better some, daily cases 10x worse October. We're right edge - imo - uncontrolled spread like LA. I'm crossing fingers keep together push back. mind-boggling. Yes please Olympics!!!!! Haha sorry getting really going depend prone vaccinated people reinfection different strains. little early write risk off. mean, duh? go hospital different reason end catching still counted model. Yeah, that‚Äôs sure vaccine hasn‚Äôt even developed year yet, don‚Äôt know evidence could vaccine provide protection years. It‚Äôs bold claim, I‚Äôm skeptical.

As effective UK South Africa strains...that would nice. we‚Äôll see evidence shows. US date format always confuses seconds first read it. Nice  need least 2 million week get control (Scientists &amp; Hancock even admitted this) 

Yet plodding along 350-375k week, sorry terrible handled whole disaster, little faith they're going able pull off.

Specially Boris claiming vaccinate 12-13 million middle February.......I believe see it. watch people sell fake vaccines scams too. wish could tell honestly know enough EUA process. Sorry  go, said foreseeable India‚Äôs mammoth vaccine production capacity entirely focused domestic including govt-govt agreements signed neighbours Bangladesh Nepal speak us actually even herd immunity would take 70% vaccinated. everyone 60+ wants vaccine taken it, over. Oh, Britain. frequently disappoint never really surprise me. Well, despite able work home...as we've done past 10 months successfully...My employer bringing us back Monday!

Some places learn covid adapt. companies fight go back pre-covid world employees desks onsite.

My workday consist going office windows closing door. need communicate co-workers, we'll use phone IM. meetings, they'll Zoom. Exactly like home, yet I'll risk coming contact people restroom/hallway/stairwell/elevator getting covid. I'm hoping spike, reduced testing data backlog due holidays, know full picture what's going little longer. Per COVID Tracking Project, hospitalization data steadily coming in, states still even report that. Yesterday's cases deaths second highest, know much due backlog. may see spike due backlog data week truer numbers next week testing normal reporting catches again. first major vaccine rollout human history

That's....[simply Israel leads world vaccinations percent population. learn lot studying accomplished this. headlines bad Florida constantly shoot dozens states bad much worse (s/o SoCal)? al go line mix catch person injecting ppe wear? Wow, severity decreasing? hope that! I'm coming anniversary next month, tinnitus/sore limbs/tachycardia/too many symptoms list much present. However situation gives hope. 

Hey, sending good vibes. hope things keep moving positively you. Hope correct, sub oscillates lot. went worrying mutations might make vaccines less effective last week, it‚Äôs good lasts years week Seems unprofessional nurses telling patients that. say vaccines work way, taking consideration vaccine completely different previous vaccines?

Doesn't matter. end result same: body trained immune response spike protein coronavirus.  Well, soldiers typically younger physically fit rest population, also probably due fact easier Army quarantine rest us.

I suppose limited military paradox, general, low individual/high group risk stats bit paradoxical. Maybe scientific sense. Viral immunologist here. Antibodies actually key preventing reinfection. Memory cells help next infection less severe, respond slow stop entirely. 

You smarter ignore comments sub take media word. could go wrong every state rules? Ohhhh..... big thread used stikyied here: less 2 years new variant vaccine doesn‚Äôt work anyway. Also bit common sense tells it‚Äôs ‚Äòeffective for.‚Äô mean ""spreads far worse warmer temperatures""? 26,500 Covid patients hospital, meaning nearly third people hospital virus.  London, half patients treated hospital Covid.  prompted many hospitals cancel routine operations make space - signs starting happen cancer care too. Well lot immigrants 3rd world countries could add antibody levels dropping mean lose immunity quite possibly still cells provide immune response infection. was, it'd incredibly expensive. likely wait. Smart. People come vaccine still dodge Floridians month so. 

I‚Äôve learned stay heck away vast swaths public. Someone nicer place would like babe woods. Haha That's it? 17 - 18,000? California somewhere 40 - 70,000 new cases per day last two weeks. 

Do math. Cali wayyyyyyyy worse Florida right now. CA winning! That's cool. nurses doctor's office told yesterday yet gotten vaccine ""they're fence"" it.

Let's get science work fixing part now. Could first country herd immunity seems totally agree. percent extra doses small, adds up. They'd run 1%-ers soon enough... single shot data holds confidence approach sensible current circumstances. say no-brainer, getting close. I'm hoping get enough people sign first groups offer lower tier people since there's benefit getting vaccinated well. It‚Äôs great rocks. multidose flu vaccine vials.  Racist /s limited age, amount damage cytokine storm causes largely dependent young healthy immune system. downvoted widely discussed past year reasons spanish flu killed young people old. CDC estimated 30% Americans Dec 11th. four weeks averaging 2-3% Americans infected per week. 

I wish definitive answers, 40% best infer available information. roommate mild covid month ago, lost smell taste. Got back week. absolutely meant that‚Äôs provided us I've wondered Georgia, too, 1/2 y'alls' population pretty much mirror ratio'd you. see bad Pennsylvania Illinois death-wise, I'm always wondering what's difference?

Remember kids, market solves everything! Since everyone taking daily dose anti China. Chinese, say biased news. Long time ago, China many countries proposed investigate covid origin globally, including China course. US Australia it. want investigate origin China. (According comment logics here, trying hide?)

Countries agree each. China reason approval investigation like US Australia proposed. hasn‚Äôt information yet. You‚Äôre literally hearing different reporters interpreting scientists statement ‚ÄúWe dunno yet‚Äù. think teachers go work too.  think acceptable amount risk.

Other people over... say, 60, people certain conditions household member get unemployment, matter line work.

But rank file go work. It‚Äôs dumb? lost family friends it? Based replies, I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôre well haven‚Äôt harshly impacted it. aware there‚Äôs new strain Coronavirus, making catchable? hysteria spreading? far know, I‚Äôve truthful front-facing situation. There‚Äôs nothing exaggerated I‚Äôve said far, correct I‚Äôm wrong.

It‚Äôs genuinely laughable you‚Äôre telling Google it. already like implied, it‚Äôs expected results. Most, all, doctors completely behind following guidelines local restrictions. agree cancel culture, don‚Äôt wrap that. Yeah I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared losing parents, friends, coworkers many high risk catching it. everyone actually participated part, would back normal now. selfishness really showing. Also got small pp apology necessary-we love little monsters! Middle school weird age us anyway! Thanks though! I‚Äôm trying stay healthy, keep kiddos healthy, too. can't say blame them. CDC recommendation isolate 10 days onset symptoms (or positive PCR test asymptomatic). exposed within 3 months need quarantine unless develop symptoms. Australian know tall poppy syndrome. think underplaying fact academia ambitious high schools maths educator Ivy League school would huge selection point.  


The general public may see pompous etc someone hiring exactly want hear. Considering reply don‚Äôt think UK taking seriously. deaths US much higher reported. UK figures (mostly) accurate. ‚ÄúUK strain‚Äù load bullshit. used scapegoat order cover incompetence regards policy making Tory govt. Like imposing stricter restrictions London, long time ago. 

Instead listening British govt ‚Äúexperts‚Äù aren‚Äôt even qualified subject matter. Try watching this, actual professor specialise subject matters. I''d probably find cheapest hotel could get 10-14 days meeting them. People give shit Americans, idiots idiotic theirs.

Plus got 100 million them. got approved like less month ago lol. Give time production delivery. dare downplay Trump's involvement, he's leader entire country spent months upon months upon months saying virus real Democrat hoax Chinese hoax.


Simply fucking absurd say his, Republican ""leaders"" fault. 5 million rural people side world. I‚Äôve noticed increasingly last year media outlets headlines sensationalise and/or misrepresent article states. guess headline gets clicks media outlet cannot accused lying article ok. Unfortunately many don‚Äôt read article. 3% LA county tested positive last three weeks. feel it‚Äôs pretty reasonable assumption true number infections double confirmed time period think Antibody tests confirm that. Peru Worldometer counts reported covid death, undercount well seems though new strain drive new wave cases. Looking what's happening UK scary think new variant takes hold number new cases increase fast even compared older variants. Even extreme measures slow still produces new cases fast. new variant probably come worst time Xmas new year occurring. learned researchers Japan developed method enable swift detection coronavirus variants spreading rapidly Britain South Africa.

As in, method identifying COVID variants created, COVID variants mutated specifically Japan. look percentage positive tests, higher percentage, unknown cases are. necessarily means unknown death, sign

P.S. actually much complicated. Well, one, people done virus mean virus done us. many patients died? believe joke lived two revolutions.. ""We're sorry Mubarak bumper stickers"" everywhere years removed.. wife 100% Homeoffice since march

Look fear mongering is. statement fits 100%. Saying million people dead summer without factual reasoning fear mongering... genius. So, saying UK could place closed airports sooner? Methinks there's factors far outweigh island, although certainly helps border restrictions. Mckinsey, folks brought supermarket price fixing scandals designed immigration concentration camps. Great choice. Yes, ever actually France? think so. one knows plan is. great good place right now, lift travel ban, need vaccine üòê asshole CUT VACATION SHORT day supposed end.

And time DeSantis doesn‚Äôt spare 3,000 nurses call on.

Hospitalizations trippled bit month, continue climb. Amazing smart system works! think it‚Äôs people disappointed vaccine rollout thought would go way faster. lot people put ton faith vaccines ordinary people could still wait 6 months replies this, gonna pop PhD immunology remind everyone 

1) Take individuals seriously experiences

2) use anecdotes determine larger trends

3) Wait professionals sort play safe meanwhile mean renowned drinking copious amounts tea one highest infection rates world. know:

You're trying rationalize cutting line getting vaccine knowing that, that, someone may actually need vaccine survive next 6 months get it. lockdown next days country get hit hard old population. much ICUs. You, too. wonder though long covid impacting young people case. Young people wont get vaccinated 2022, also likely end hospital. But, covid still give long term health complications. Government choose that's sacrifice worth making try get back normality, waiting vaccinated. actually lack empathy. caught covid need pull bootstraps okay. study! Seriously though, think know years progress based reinfection numbers. probably one reasons told testing still go 2022. Great hear father recovered! 

Can ask tested antibodies second time Covid 19? ask UK testing antibodies widespread. know UK state antibodies mean immune cannot pass develop disease again.  Hope family continue good luck time. always tipping point, right front window opportunity, verge disaster?! fucking year, getting weird feeling ""temporary"" becoming new de facto (very limited) reality. really feels like something off. Yeah never cough either. Oximeter never dipped 97 breathe fine. friend can't walk around block without getting winded. Weird different everyone. mom declined yesterday. Wish could taken instead Yes please. Finish long-term care healthcare personnel. that, let 'er rip. tests approved sold. massive free testing leave individuals buy. Hahahahahaha, updoot you, great comment next moderna dose 4 weeks believe. None symptoms I'm bad. They're annoying all. shy 50% deaths per capita FL snd say that‚Äôs subtle increase?

Really? point getting tested ensure people room covid. Getting tested letting people in, **before** results out, defeats purpose. probably misunderstood ""combine."" experience vaccines going conference room work rolling sleeve. Depends much RAM Corona Virus 2 uses. dont want get stuck downloading RAM. say get 128 case. Idk, .02 Oh dear God please We‚Äôre Europe European Union Nice. Yes, also many taken vaccinations want one particular. It‚Äôs mandatory friends fam healthcare get it, quite opting despite working Covid positive patients. noticed amongst set doctors getting ASAP nurses not. 
Sign up. Etowah County joins several Florida counties apparently heard online booking systems. must misinterpreted ""combine"" then. makes lot sense even agree that. say vaccines work way, taking consideration vaccine completely different previous vaccines? others saying, doesn‚Äôt provide immunity. Instead lessens severity covid get it. It‚Äôs also weakened dead virus like vaccines. It‚Äôs spike protein. know enough information us really know wanted bring unsure this. know want get vaccine want world get back normal ASAP. I‚Äôve first dose. Pretty store arm 36 hours, brief low grade fever (like hours felt totally fine warm) back normal. 

Coworkers far same.  wanna cry cynism strong. ran fever day, felt like beaten within inch life week still feel bit winded going stairs, going long walks, etc never even cough I‚Äôm Maryland waiting nyc reopen move there. California New York Maryland‚Äôs restrictions based purely media public opinion. California banned outdoor dining zero basis nail coffin many many restaurants. isn‚Äôt remotly massive public annoyance know congress people brave denying everyone gets it. Considering resources go member congress get it, knock nonsense complete vaccine series. 

There enough vaccine lot sitting hospital freezers. never know emergency like yesterday can't follow social distancing guidelines. I'm english yet know fortnight 2 weeks, supposed uncommon word...? correct... throwing immunology words around. even know start. missing fundamental idea vaccine understanding innate adaptive immunity. use vaccine elucidate adaptive response (mostly antibodies). long think would take US federal government create online registration verifies individual points specific location specific time.

Why necessary? Treat like buying plane ticket online. book ""ticket"", show appropriate time, show form ID, get shot. information gets stored way plane ticket information stored. work? problem majority first approach minority risk complications like older people less likely use internet. 20 million people without broadband.

So? 330 million Americans. thinking protect 90% Americans quickly, say next month so, think reach remaining 10%. Instead backwards, focus minority instead majority. Without realizing basically saying young middle class white people get vaccine first even though statistically safest.

If fastest way get vaccine majority Americans, problem? Likely, maybe, probably... basically know TA: So, ultimately, what's take Koci: me, right answer stay course. Stick know works. need patient. need recognize got ridiculously lucky quickly able make vaccine virus. lot diseases we've worked decades still good vaccines for. case, one vaccine, three‚Äîwith way‚Äîand astonishing time. fact vaccines quickly, high effectiveness bit truly good news 2020. Take win. heard opened windows Death admitting wrong Ahh sorry misread request. I‚Äôll look info - think couple counties extended like SF many set let expire. county created one, Healthcare high risk disease tells fuck off. 
 
Fuck us higher risk frontline retail work guess. see option 5G. get 5G one? American knew meant. worth noting difference acting surface (like table) acting like volcano shooting endless supply vid juice across room every time breath. What? think that‚Äôs kind blanket statement made ‚Äúnatural‚Äù vs vaccine immunity that‚Äôs dependent whole gamut matters like type infection, route/type vaccine, host, etc. 

Also viral infections including Covid develop adaptive response well. Hence serological testing. Probably anecdotal father got beginning March (at home fever/cough/pain, hospitalisation). September tested antibodies turned still. many effective, know, that's whole 7 months later. sore arm that's it, symptoms. second pfizer dose 2 weeks. believe covid Feb. Immune response better vaccine live virus less inflammation. Good know, great news true. Two years immunity acceptable long enough indeed kill outbreak. Win, win win. Phew. San Francisco: 

We okay overall terms ICU (23% free) acute care (22% free) capacity, especially comparison rest state Bay Area. Additionally, COVID cases making 12% acute care capacity 22% ICU capacity. 

It‚Äôs hospital-by-hospital scenario right now, course transfers parts state COVID numbers SF relenting, could different story couple weeks. Pfizer available UAE. weeks Except becoming apparent that, fact, can... can't. almost certainly false. still follow precautions, especially since vaccine 100% effective almost certainly keeps transmitting fully immune. every vaccine works, stands reason one will, too.  Scientific question here: long '*a couple years'*? 

My experience 2-5, could vary across cultures regions. need one centralized logistical coordination demand tied supply. 50 separate organizing approaches clusterfuck slowing everything down

That even make sense. demand everywhere. like anywhere excess doses (I mean, everywhere unused doses healthcare providers fucking up, nowhere given doses elderly want them). make sense take doses places good job allocating actually giving fucking giving out. I'm ready available cancer patient husband. obviously want one really want get one asap. vaccines/diseases, booster shots form extremely effective. Bloomberg showing number doses distributed administered. South Dakota top percentage distributed doses given. long ok grand. Cheers mate. Moderna vaccine, 1st dose. Sore arm 72 hours, little tired usual.

No ill effects. Getting downvoted cause im realistic, never change reddit I'm sure get removed ""misinformation"" support ""lockdown everything forever"" narrative sub loves... One 9/11 tragedy, lot 9/11s statistic, say. That's long ago honest. Even though corrected, always small sliver doubt. 

And vaccine expedited. I'm shitting anything, literally definition. amazing accomplishment unbelievable many.

ALSO, singling blacks (41% likely) Republicans (18% likely) morons pretty bigoted 71% women listed likely take it. ready call majority women morons, too? I'm sure anyone say unlikely major consequences round 2 occurs, hope Covid 19 develops appears attack areas body way still even close properly understood medical world. fully expect Covid still headline news quite time. Stay safe there. I'm also looking forward news Novavax. I'm sure Commission finalize deal give efficacy readout, expected soon. challenge many aspects statement:

1) calendar year appropriate measure this? Especially given recent emergence virus uneven prevalence around world.

2) wouldn‚Äôt flat (or decreased) excess mortality actually indication counter-measures successful? Wouldn‚Äôt need compare world counter-measures regular year make assessment?

3) look excess mortality average years, 2019 could outlier.

4) argument excess mortality flat (or less) isn‚Äôt supported studies figures I‚Äôve seen. provide citation? \+racism.... hurting poor... Ah - that's SF only. looking information Bay Area counties. less accidental deaths traffic alcohol.

Sweden traffic accident deaths:

2017: **252**

2018: **324**

2019: **221**

2020: saying made difference overall mortality 2020?

Reducing risk symptoms?

Reducing risk transmission?

What long term effects?!?! people drive nuts cause usually logic consistent. long term effects vaccine issue technically know people catch covid ""don't symptoms"" ""just flu"" end long term effects also since Covid-19 around long. Many people get check ups severe symptoms. people realize country failed working pandemic means food, housing, healthcare them, would go bankrupt business owner due real lockdown.

Roughly half us realize this. half care twice loud us. And, last night demonstrates, openly violent even attack country claim care about. tweak vaccines pretty rapidly, though that's certainly ideal situation. Buy stocks! Economy going moon! knew going since least December, 2018. could prepared then. Several Gov officials urged POTUS so. Didn‚Äôt happen. well documented.

SO right back really. Immunity still something bet build policy around. still questions answers really nations much better others even far fewer resources. geographies genetics seem better, could lack modern understanding/modeling pandemics too.

There's still little chance immunity truly long lasting 10+ years, means virus stays circulation much world may need re-vaccinated X amount months unfortunately mRNA vaccine immunity studied completely separately natural immunity. That's one benefit traditional vaccines, produce natural immune responses datasets likely similar mechanism something nature selected time. Soo use weakened viral particles tested vaccine model, also produces immune response natural predictable.

One big question vaccine model produces longer lasting immunity. expect last reliable 2 years I'd average guess 12 months guess.. reliably though.

Bringing various variants communities collapse health care system. Yes, course.

Next question? government *incapable* planning ahead, conscious choice made so. think right. Sure, initial infectious dose order 10\^2 - 10\^4, virus replicates, right? I'm sure RNA copy numbers correlate viral load, people RNA copy numbers PCR order millions per 1mL sample. I'd think amount virus active SARS-CoV2 infection billions trillions.  Spring birthdays get screwed over. Mine daughter's April--missed last year's probably miss year's well.

""They make cute couple... 5 them!"" people get infected vaccinated, point? Ugh... people, plague are.  hate America? I've heard doctors getting nurses workers aren't. Kinda telling, IMO... Immune system going overdrive. Immune-mediated thrombopenia rare. (like Germany's valid obsession privacy leading mostly cash based culture).

I ENAMERED sentence, dearly need thorough explanation. guess: New York. governor declared would fine anyone US$ 1 million revoke licenses vaccines given someone priority list. criminal sanction far pretty egregious, hospitals avoiding risk would rather let viruses go waste rather fight state's autocratic governor. manufacturers literally claiming 90 95% efficacy evidence suggests recovered COVID sufferers close 100% immune least short term. Therefore sensible conclusion based empirical data naturally acquired immunity superior vaccine-conferred immunity. Thus matter opinion--its logical conclusion draw evidence.

If believe vaccines confer superior immunity, belief contrary evidence. speeding up, that's great. supply though also obviously good thing. Needles arms needs catch supply places seem urgency get frustrating.

Now we're almost month global vaccination effort, I'm convinced that's way it. United States distributed almost 20,000,000 vaccines we've used 5,000,000. strict priority system, would probably 6% country vaccinated now.

I really, really hope start see states drop loosen priority system. working way we'd hoped need switch system that's meeting expectations.

Edit: people pointed Israel giving age right now, true, reason referred ignoring categorical system easy verify age distribute broadly that's category even consider comparable current American system. Shame! Yeah asked ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  Vaccine questions U.S.:

when get first shot, get kind paperwork saying did? second shot?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, got first shot, ""priority"" comes time get second? Developing countries see family members die preventable diseases. access vaccines, take it. rates vaccination lower accessibility.

So understand think data contradicts statement likely last couple years? way read summary data SUPPORTING statement, contradicting it. small number infected people new study long-lasting immunity recovery, perhaps differences amounts coronavirus exposed to. vaccines overcome individual variability, said Jennifer Gommerman, immunologist University Toronto.


This I'm trying explain. Conveniently found article problem is, agency lot bureocracy nothing vaccines (actually, president anti-vaxx dumber president Tanzania pandemic)

That's true. ANVISA approve 10 days docs sent them. Coronavac approved yet Chinese wanted analyse data understand results Brazil different Turkey's, therefore final docs never even sent approval request. They're expected sent today tomorrow, starting 10 days deadline.

Our president dumb though, part correct. haven‚Äôt gotten New Year numbers either yet honestly felt better plan prisoners nursing homes vaccinate employees Visitors.

If employees refuse get fire them.

If want see Grandma need shot.

They leave facility, way get people coming in.

Besides. every day people spreading it.

Open wrong though. CDC released paper saying approximately 91MM infections US end September. Extrapolating today means US 150MM infections belt. would mean 45% country already possesses near 100% immunity least short term, although looks like infection conferred immunity might last long time:

Edited case. got mine Tuesday! Got Moderna one clarify, article healthcare workers actively refusing vaccine offered, prioritized. so? Cause variant? case, regular variant China variant since that‚Äôs discovered first. less educated well Source: Trust bro! Germany. Health minister also saying ""professionals"" take flu vaccine much. Here's one estimate indicates get herd immunity July combined natural infections. I'd curious see projections, anyone hospital work offered vaccine everyone. 25% accepted offer, included. also offered travelers contracted staff, included percentage. live east coast. want crap over, ASAP. Stay safe, gentleladies! seems like they‚Äôre deep shit across board honestly Can't skip start vaccination people want it? faster per site, sites voted. made contributions campaigns cared about. convinced others vote. like good citizen supposed do.

And worked - although results may yet take couple weeks fully kick in. Sorry reply blunt. realize people die general we're vaccinating millions Close - 68, great physical health. county, 65+ eligible receive upcoming weeks. ppl want know Cali struggling Winter Surge. we're idiots! right, left, outlet malls, airports, even freakin hospitals front-line. We've become Florida. agree things done right much possible, hand, long works, not? liability part may concerning though. went back June, crazy. situation, come back office continue everything via Email/Teams/Phone, inside people reason. Masks required common areas, cubicles, four foot walls protect Covid. average 5 new cases week megalomaniac CEO needs see asses seats.

Good luck, feel you. Consider use-case.  live (say) Washington state. register vaccine. dose vaccine becomes available (say) Florida. told go get dose..... airplane ticket $4500 (small-town small-town, two connections, same-day departure). 

There really little point huge patient-wait-list, without geographic separation. Patients cannot seriously expected travel far.

Coordination within county- city- area, sure. Move vaccine administration site running out.  Increase deliveries area area running low, relative areas. Bibi, elections Awesome hear. assume dentist fewer patients last year cancelled appointments. hope help balance things well. per capita death cases worse California.. FWIW..  real time, subreddit FAQ several vaccine trackers! Phrased poorly seems case spread much decreased warm weather.

There's papers this. [Here's telling 6 year reach 60% last month's standards Got it! finish year gotta move 6 times faster. Hmmm ""Sit down, take shoes off, make comfortable!""

We‚Äôre first state US hit 2 million infections doubt we‚Äôll also first hit 3 million... 4 million... Sinopharm's also inactivated? Oh film finance stinks high heaven. makes music look honest :,-( 1. COVID vaccines 90%, Pfizer, Moderna Sputnik. AZ probably J&amp;J (because it‚Äôs single dose) used US despite less 90%.

2. COVID far infectious flu, vaccine hesitancy greater barrier herd immunity. seemed well, sense they're ICUs 85% capacity. Nope, entirely preventative really.... unless migraine-type headache it. flu vaccines 50 60% effective. multiple covid vaccines hit 90%+ preventing symptoms, likely provide sterilizing immunity stop community transmission. think end next year covid like measles. hear sporadic outbreaks certain cities, nothing cause lockdowns. They'll recommend ppl mask up, wash hands avoid crowds elderly. Cool. send fucking morons reason spreading misinformation vaccine lasts 2-3 months. idea fuck even GOT information from, since rolling mass inoculations. done better job lot things, get vote people tell government problem. know process stand said. seen kind gear biohackers get lately? viral replication well within guys garage labs. someone money, gear tiny quantities particularly difficult find online. talking vaccines.

I german know word either years ago. able enjoy nice education system. feel bad smug assholes buddy :3 very, likely taking vaccine already antibodies covid earlier year even recently. Australia btw it‚Äôs prob going different USA particularly UK. they‚Äôre eligible soon, 70-80+ age group? so, won‚Äôt likely see called long term effects even any. Four factors:

1) Wealth

2) Relatively low population

3) landmass smaller Vermont

4) Near-universal military training ability use army help vaccine deployment He's right though. gilded comment proper grasp basic immunology. We'll wait gather data confirm, yes promising! Oh cool  mean cough suppressants might interfere getting well? really know much helps. videos deniers say stuff like, ""looks like busy hospital, what?"" untrained eye, maybe that's look like. things simply film: can't really film exhaustion. can't film staff shortages. 

There's Korean film called Flu pandemic hits city, cars crashing, people projectile vomiting blood, dying streets, seizing foaming mouth ERs; think that's lot people *expect* see hear ""overwhelmed hospital."" man lunatic! live? He's like Nazi Florida concentration camp. many sicken kill? Quite literally. true scientific sense whatsoever. 

This misinformed anti-vaxx nonsense.  people SARS MERS immune COVID Feel like 30% population even take it, works well.  explains Oxford vaccine hyped despite lackluster efficacy... vaccine nationalism. Exactly. Mountain Pass mine's breakeven? Probably around 60-100 guess knowing nothing. 


That realistically price would seen day current extractors required keep normal safety environmental regulations _without_ increasing domestic pay. 


That is, saying 'the modern day slaves prevented mass death poor countries corrupted groundwater treetop' would make extraction worthwhile developed countries. 


Utter insanity anyone thinks global conflict could arise resources. Scarcity incredibly rare cause conflict. Conflict caused good old fashioned human ambition. France ran food killed king anyone else could get hold of. fed conquered Europe. Germany made two goes conquest strong rich country. sun never set British Empire damn rich controlled overwhelming majority worlds wealth took hundred years austerity see crumble. vast majority long term injury occurs hospitalized. Small land area country dense population centralized distribution major reason. Bahrain UAE right behind percent population vaccinated similar reasons. /r/iamverybadass Right US 1,59%. (according stats, course 100% accurate). number needs divided though people gotten half dose. 0,8%. done 26 days since first vaccination. 0,03% vaccinated day average. 
If expected pace would take pretty much exactly 2000 days reach 60%.

This calculation course take account current acceleration vaccinations, take account lot things, answer. get done bolsanaro sets country fire OK. Locked constant off-topic politics. reason wealthy white people jump front people need vaccine sooner. Period. heartbreaking. would first come work second dose three weeks later? can‚Äôt first come time? fact crisis make people coke together, crisis everyday going fucking exhausting

Except we're still crisis. We've crisis 10 eventually someone going fuck crisis turn disaster.

*Four thousand people* died yesterday. disaster would enormous improvement current situation. don‚Äôt want sound like arsehole people must greatful health workers. infection rates, truth is; either antibodies vaccine actual virus die. 

I know it‚Äôs great situation. reality give fuck. hospitals ones here, ones refusing give ‚Äúthey haven‚Äôt vaccinated staff yet‚Äù I'd interested see data reasons refusing it. trust vaccine? already virus would prefer vaccine go someone natural immunity? actually work patients would prefer go someone does?  idea simplistic-

So people register online want apportion things-



But don‚Äôt consider local conditions ground. infrastructure Brooklyn looks lot different Chicago worlds different appalachia I'm sure they'd love years :) saying false. know thing mutates, happens when, later year, virus escapes vaccines? especially non-mRNA ones? Jesus Christ, he's saying Zero Covid goal. read??? Texan living Rio Grande Valley I‚Äôve seen old people get it. I‚Äôve seen friends aren‚Äôt health care professionals get it. I‚Äôve seen elderly know get unless family healthcare profession. It‚Äôs fucked blatant terms. better works protecting better works far wearing it. majority people slip wearing masks loose. Glasses fogging up? Tighten mask. They're gonna done soon  Keep. It. Up! Source long term? keep watching reading virologist vaccine specialist' takes still say longitudinal studies need done (as they're natural infection induced immunity)  Guess finally found data want Oxford vaccine don‚Äôt trust supply chain keep vaccines cold enough given.
Our medical system geared toward fridge stored vaccines know done correctly.

Things complicated tend go wrong. anyone expect anything else, dont even mask mandate Florida. vaccines available take uses method... Chill bro. Afaik, cheapest vaccine AstraZeneca‚Äôs, stored refrigerator. Also initiative distribute developing world without profit. Sadly, lot Americans know Fortnight really popular game go broke buying skins toon .. grocery delivery well. I‚Äôve stores require everyone mask frequently. people flout rule more, go hiding more. exhausting frustrating vaccine feels like dream point. Hang there. It‚Äôs worth it! never foregone conclusion winter supposed bad. I'm even talking US, countries Western world basically saw second wave creeping September messed around half-measures hold back, turned shitshow now. Everyone's always saying ""we done quick hard lockdown early on"", well time second wave becoming clear trend exactly would've possible, instead everyone sat around even though seeing train wreck coming slow motion. could also mean strong response it. immune system complex. course realize.

Mods mostly college student fit pro lockdown narrative. #s indoor restaurants, bars, nightclubs, concerts fully reopened.

There's indication refusing vaccine means ""refusing entirely"" ""someone else get first"". 

In case, case health care workers reading this, get offered vaccine, take it. system agile enough yet move priority lists refusing seems often lead dose sitting storage while, worst possible scenario. rate they're going re-branded ***In Burger Covid***. Governor east coast? 

[Florida seem better job administering Virginia much better job sticking CDC guidelines. confirmed back then? also possible false positive back then. symptoms first thought infected? tetanus toxoid -- though strictly infection. Glad know i'm one! I'm grocery delivery all, set foot grocery store since March 16th. getting hard Official suggestion. love it. Explains why, google it, results yesterday, magical phrase winked existence. get erring side extreme precaution medical professional. doctor also recommends never two alcoholic drinks evening. I've read enough enough background biology know require vaccine time likely I'm safe. tardiness rollout far going allow vaccine persist long time, plenty time evolve vaccine resistance, already new variants. mRNA vaccines adjusted fairly quickly, there's still lot overhead there. non-mRNA ones presumably rendered useless within months.  years anti vaccine crowd infect world again???  even get vaccine doesn‚Äôt last?  Seems like one getting vaccines enough doses whole world it. Reports agreed pay everyone else. 30 dollars dose opposed 15. figure it'll save money avoiding lockdowns like one they're currently  announced Pfizer supply enough vaccines vaccinate entire population end March exchange data Israeli healthcare system. agree, vaccinating 24/7 run out.   Pretty sure official suggestion DHHS. They're straight going believe numbers. matter get from, source false. They'd rather believe homemade youtube video official source there.  could seen coming? Individual healthcare providers creating i'm at, signed one waiting list high risk folks waiting list everyone else. Supposedly every time get batch vaccines they'll contact people high risk list first move one there's left waste anything. lot harder notice case drop hardly cases begin with. United States vaccinated twenty percent population- Individuals 60- deaths would go 80%. different situation. Say whaaaat???? I'm North Carolinian well. someone please tell fuck ""Secretarial Directive"" is? Granted, I've learned lot emergency response system state past year this, yet another new thing me. Immunity organism's resistance infection pathogen. Pfizer trial look immunity. vaccine nothing, would expect 162 people vaccine group COVID symptoms positive PCR trial period, instead 8 did. means average vaccine group 95% immunity. 

What describing whether immune person carrier. know.

Since know recommendation keep taking precautions like social distancing, avoiding leaving home non-essential reasons, washing hands, wearing masks, etc. People summer aren‚Äôt testing positive antibodies rapid test 6 months later. Ideas why? Shortness breath doesn‚Äôt seem improving. Chest pain. Abnormal high heart rates don‚Äôt recover quickly

This doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs definitely damage though. high heart rates got checked doctor said body deconditioned sick. felt better 6-7 weeks helpful it‚Äôs becoming bit wearing.

Call beforehand. Use position insight mobilise. Bring publicity areas lack preparedness resources.

Anyone say done better J&amp;J AstraZeneca vaccines approved distributed, matter injecting vaccine quickly enough. companies production facilities continents ramp production faster Pfizer Moderna.

Borders political decision remember. Australia remains state covid eradicated locally highly suppressed, borders likely stay longer whereas countries virus widespread like US UK might willing loosen restrictions readily protected vulnerable. point give 60s want completely incorrect. forgetting fact adaptive immunity also develops natural infection. country in, what's job? curious see certain places rollout process. Rlftf gave u upvote doom gloom reality, pessimism. Downvotes dreamers drinking Kool Aid think magically disappear. can't even administer ones far better terms efficacy. trial also rather flawed surprised hear many issues had.

Nine months counting. can‚Äôt answer I‚Äôm sure Pfizer Moderna protocols were. would assume way would done fulfill percentage every country‚Äôs order time, say start giving everyone 10% order, since going supplies quickly, companies keep shipping since ready whereas countries like US UK still millions hand. faith! exactly. first got sick beginning March. eligible test end May, tested positive. reinfected, viral shedding. obviously reinfection still possible. like United States, bought it. Sincerely hope Monday: Came 102-103F fever. muscle aches symptoms.

Tuesday: Fever subsided. Felt good overall. Took COVID PCR test Kaiser morning. Fever mostly gone end day. Felt normal.

Wednesday: Temperature normal. Feel great. Covid test came back Negative. Influenza A/B came back negative.

Thursday: Temperature still normal. Still feeling fine.


I would continue isolate rough wife taking care kid alone. mostly okay? engaged high risk exposure since March last year. leave house pick groceries, wear N95 mask, avoid people can. also got flu vaccine October pertinent.   vaccine nearly always superior 'natural' infection terms developing immunity

This categorically false. Natural immunity virtually ALWAYS lasts longer vaccine immunity. sure you‚Äôre troll badly misinformed. Ya people objecting others need right? smart. country use existing infrastructure. Germany 40% hospitalized younger 60.
So perfectly vaccinating elderly would give us extra hospital capacity would spent days without lockdown. going take time. Luckily, many vaccines approved next weeks. wait people vaccinated. get sensationalist articles. Tons them, probably even reinfection now. Pfizer choice... thought video game. Mostly. got first shot today (i relatively young health org belong announced got excess shots people ages professions come). hundreds fit young people waiting hours line. Yeah, us wore masks, properly so, one kept two meters distancing all. lines open, probably less riskier, joked waiting definitely getting immuned today, either vaccine catching covid waiting. Yeah - We'll offices doors shut...and phone calls/zoom calls other.

Not really sure others bashing work home thread. work remote work common.

I get fields may effective. Texas isn't. There's central database. supposed know group try find vaccine list providers. places distributing vaccine patients. doctor approved provider, luck unless luck county independent pharmacy. literally worst system. reason asked question, received false positive PCR test. took rapid PCR incase one day, even thou ""symptoms"" mild cough woke headache dizziness.  Rapid negative couple days later got call saying PCR said positive. surprised becuase feeling fine point. got another rapid pcr (4 days initial test). Rapid came back negative again, got back lab work said covid detected. said NAA test PCR, little confused. a) They're supposed guarded hotels. 
b) leak would create problems. zero-local spread area. know mean 48 hours?  Maybe daily thread California numbers since people apparently can‚Äôt look nytimes tracker google away It'll also happen vaccines. things might gradient scale.

People unwilling go ""heavy lockdowns"".  willing go ""extremely light lockdowns"". am, imposed one myself, large number people different groups (some deniers, young give shitters) ""refuse live fear"" refuse take seriously whatever reason.  There's way-too-large group morons--with overlap Coup-Klux-Klan terrorists saw yesterday--who think gubmint telling slap paper jowls cause armed aggressive revolution.  Whee. 
There also lot people unfortunately work unable pay bills eat, know few...we big whole safety net thing here.  crazy bars open example, also keeping bunch people know afloat. Sucky situation. don‚Äôt know still carry transmit it. don‚Äôt evidence can‚Äôt, studied yet. vaccines prevent transmitting disease provide immunity for, likely covid vaccines - don‚Äôt evidence (or against) yet. weird it.....All nurses doctors office addicted energy drinks, still really unhealthy Well, gotten infectious probably less lethal dangerous UK running beds fast. dealing something less serious flu large parts population form lot states (including home state MD) seem moving rolling vaccination phases there's enough supply vaccinate groups start next phase regardless many earlier phase vaccinated. eliminate problem enough supply allocated thought said Madonna CEO soooo confused think... really hope... far people get vaccine major side effects vaccinated people actually get sick COVID, societal pressure help get 'do intend' group change mind. People exposed SARS-1 17 years ago still believed immune it. SARS-2 similar regard, natural infection would confer long term immunity. 

The notion soooo many people pushing--that vaccine-conferred immunity superior naturally acquired immunity--is likely incorrect. couple vaccines arguable confer superior immunity natural infection, neither acute viral infections. HPV pneumococcus vaccines ones know of. wish enough vaccines unfortunately doubt people would agree vaccinated. rationale? I‚Äôm flabbergasted. people give shit Tuskegee college educated white progs. average black persons vaccine hesitancy likely comes Afrocentric conspiracy theory pages social media. End year. Hell yes. Well took body least two weeks recognize bug get rid it, confident. British publication, use fortnight every day speak.

But, experience American education system, maybe make complicated words like little simpler you. know must hard, especially half believe democratic system voting. Hospitals seeing 50% rejection rates among front-line staff. let people get vaccine. Yes consider nursing home it‚Äôs bubble, could potentially reach herd immunity within bubble. no? Reduction ICU time crucial well. Given horrific surge UK. Johnson &amp; Johnson's? one far that's one shot kept regular vaccine temperature  blame old age? signed something similar WA. Provided basic info confirmed want vaccine email it‚Äôs available. Biden needs institute forced nationwide lockdown everyone vaccinated. ""increase"" herd immunity, *reach* herd immunity. reach herd immunity, herd immunity. Durrrrr Stupid question, normal every day citizen ‚Äúget line‚Äù get vaccine? point first sentence! Disagree testing ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt even anything‚Äù. shot time, work information available us. wish process wasn‚Äôt aggressively shitted federal administration get-go are. Duh Healthy thinking.  Wishful thinking. France biggest Anti-vaxx country Europe. already enshrined executive order real question get 64mb splurge 128mb upgrade? People easily believe urban myths? else mean? Yeah, treating paying nursing home workers like shit really comes back bite us. 

You can't replace people. problem infected, show symptoms still contagious days. takes infect one.

That one infects 2.

That two infects 4

And on. on. on. That‚Äôs good know. ever get access it. going slow Georgia. still phase 1A-health care workers. dumb playing yourself? title literally there's ENOUGH SUPPLY. Ultimately, best protection heard immunity since vaccine 100% effective. saves 1 12 patients ICU. guess 11 die? Alright who's bringing alcohol? 1162 UK deaths, 5,636 US deaths--Britain sick man Europe mean DeSantis blaming counties he's one charge distribution. know, since tasked getting state. could advances treatment place time Florida's spike hit. Things like prone position, giving nasal oxygen etc. brother works ICU said new techniques treatments come along changed moves along. 


I also suspect nursing homes well protected could be, time spike hit protected say NYC earlier states were...and people getting covid tended younger. posted above, whole percent elderly FL overblown. 20.1% 65, bunch states 17%...that's world difference. Yeah may matter 30 percent decide get Hit baby, one time, pls! well vaccine tested compared vaccines? concerned side effects could take time reveal themselves? wait till terrorists dc get tested well, amount allocated hospitals enough staff, unused amounts occur staff refusing them. allocation problem, antivaxxer problem. hospitals profit driven entities, giving leeway would great way people money able pay way front line, certainly support allowing leeway. do, however, support ""get vaccine get fired"" healthcare workers i'm ashamed nurses etc system work refused vaccine still jobs.

my state pretty efficient health department run system, beefing would rad though. Gonna test 10 plus million like that. germ getting beat fuck mean people like me? Well, symbolism first vaccinated person Prime Minister Health Minister Oops! said again! Masks give complete protection whether social distancing not, still reduce transmission viral load.

Also, BLM protests advertised near socially distanced. Florida crazy town. wouldn‚Äôt even know start them. Desantis moron. Yeah spikes different South Africa strain every two years get shot? Seems great, go get polio booster too? live Turkey, would get Pfizer, Moderna Oxford vaccine blink eye. vaccine comes China tested Brazil, Im probably gonna get want ask this: vaccine accepted EU, US UK? Brazil, Turkey China independent press thats Im concerned also read Sinovac tried bribe official. course not, it‚Äôs insanely disappointing many people medical field ignoring science recommendations people know talking about. 

I‚Äôm lawyer, would like large percentage lawyers waived Miranda rights started spilling guts cops arrested. Yes, start sticking people ffs course, customers can't possibly infected 120 workers directly. Surely, many workers must infected other. can't happened smoking parking lot breaks.

And even case, I'd still call ""within facility"". understand health officials. problem us get vaccinated problem posting get told post every 10 minutes, impossible healthy debate.

If happy guzzling narrative, I'll leave it. Cheers. Can't economy without people Already shipped Brazil since last month, waiting aproved FDA, literally millions doses territory can't use yet...

The problem is, agency lot bureocracy nothing vaccines (actually, president anti-vaxx dumber president Tanzania pandemic) See that's idiocy that's going cause problem NOW. three different kinds poliovirus infect humans. rare, entirely possible get one kind polio, recover (which rare enough own), get different strain polio later (for outcome usually... Unfortunate). polio vaccine protects three forms, even already polio, STILL NEED vaccinated. Similarly, already got first wave COVID, still catch new UK variant (due reduced antibodies changed protein structure). vaccine likely effective strains. got sick necessarily mean clear. viruses infer lifelong immunity, even do, usually one form. Implying already got virus means okay stupid. fact already got virus means protect well enough first place. exception front line workers choice exposed it, assumption know wash hands, keep fingers nose, stay away people likely infected, infected, PLEASE, get damn vaccine make accuse filthier need point begin with. whole Florida-is-full-of-elderly overstated generally. true #2 percent 65 (Maine #1), difference state middle pack great.  Scientists never said that, knew impossible. crank did, became urban myth picked people like you. Honestly, even care. I'm tired hearing many vaccines sitting shelf many people want it. matter gets it, increase herd immunity help protect everyone. I‚Äôd rather wonder longevity effectiveness tbh. 

Maybe couple years some... maybe others less some. 

Hard say, knowing! love God, please March 11th victory day end touching note?! inner Fauci channels Picard...  LOL. OK. dramatic (and wrong).   medically cleared go vote. decision analytical model assessing multiple scenarios infectious period proportion transmission individuals never COVID-19 symptoms, transmission asymptomatic individuals estimated account half transmission.

More half. 
That‚Äôs need testing everywhere ramped contain virus. People test frequently. Maybe Biden roll along vaccines.  Damn, solid comparison Form. feel like genius every time someone moves update address July awaiting fateful day December get use it. Hard no. Nobody ever need 64mb. Easy China.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hear dead health care workers, who've died Covid.

Every single one given much attention every British soldier died Iraq Afghanistan. 

Figures late summer last year estimated 620 died Can't learn attempt read r/Coronavirus read it. Dhalsim! pro vaccine (getting mine tomorrow), post factually hot mess.

It‚Äôs true say 99.9999% people don‚Äôt LETHAL side effect, side effects general common not...

[Source Local Reactions
Among study vaccine recipients asked complete diaries symptoms 7 days vaccination, 84.7% reported least one local injection site reaction. age group, 88.7% younger group (aged 18 55 years) 79.7% older group (aged years) reported least one local reaction. Pain injection site frequent severe solicited local reaction among vaccine recipients. dose 1, younger age group reported pain frequently older age group (83.1% vs 71.1%); similar pattern observed dose 2 (77.8% vs 66.1%). 

Still- get shot! side effects mild, anaphylaxis serious we‚Äôve 0 deaths it, 3800-4K ppl died yesterday Covid. numbers clear dun wan et introduce vaccine passports, we'll regular jab need keep date. give us freedom international travel ability go events restaurants ect. stay home handful documented cases reinfection 


The key *reported cases*. take account number people tested due lack available testing ability afford paying tested safe assume numbers higher reported. That's July. I'm Ontario 99.9% wear masks. province mandated masks July. Overnight went 50% wearing 99.9%. 

Also Americans liars. lie election polling (Trump got like 6% votes polls proving lying pollsters) see fucking masks Trump coup attempt. people said disgusting open everything becaue targeted ""old people""

now fuck grandma lol plenty people care, vote people care corporate profits pandemic safety workers' rights safety. Nooooo take days positive covid silly. drop antibodies occurs every vaccine. matters long term immunity antibody titers, creation storage long lived memory B-cells virus rapidly proliferate generate high levels antibodies exposed covid-19 Vaccines always preferred. time virus enters new host, risk mutation. 

More people Vaccine means less hosts mutate in:) America's population weird position. Much smaller India China, much larger western country. many good comparisons all. China/India 4x bigger US. THAT'S HOME LET'S GOOOOOO
AM YISRAEL CHAI BABBBBBYYY Pretty sure president invoke Defense Production Act exactly that. huge amount Arab medical personnel. There‚Äôs distinction many people don‚Äôt see actually live Israel live Palestinian authority tried bribe official.
 
yeah, like Pfizer never bribe anyone..
 
just google Big Pharma scandal see Sinovac's case pale comparison.. grandparents Florida. They‚Äôre 80+ grandfather end-stage COPD. They‚Äôve taking pandemic incredibly seriously, trying find anyone who‚Äôll give vaccine. tried make appointment county health department, say wait line - metaphorically physical line. grandfather can‚Äôt stand long lungs. hard find place that‚Äôll vaccinate them? Basically like difference going head first battle vs. designing strategy beforehand  Desantis moron, county leadership decent. literally travel anywhere time day night get this. current plan state going May get chance. believe I'm reading decent newspapers. believe? Alt-right youtube? Facebook? Reddit? think that's reliable professional journalists working reputable newspapers?

Here's order State Health Office North Dakota, telling healthcare workers keep working even covid positive. Dakota allows Covid-positive healthcare workers stay job nurses warn County hospitals turn away ambulances, put patients gift shop: I‚Äôve never seen anything like Angeles running oxygen patients covid hospitalizations hit record highs Funny flu disappeared, validity PCR tests SARS-Cov-2 questioned.

Being questioned who? flu fact disappeared, probably taking many measures stop spread covid-19. flu much less infectious, mention vaccine it. Nobody knows think plenty examples people blood work find time. interesting.  I'll bring Corona! What? officials ones endangering everyone else. No, talking sussex New Jersey, US. scared ain't bad side effects crazy. root America. Clearly not. think could hate xmas lol  mean every years we'll need booster? E484K South African variant? read much except Drop UK variant. Additionally reasonable project decay curve gathering statistically significant amount data? think FDA okay making broader claims BLA. we'll see. much half 18 year olds go military days. do, less quarter go actual combat squads. Germany already financing BioNTech second plant online next month. Exactly. guys Guinea pigs rest us wait. Sounds fair. Time tell hey time tell personally also seen big increase mask use. course case everywhere think safe say ever told ""wear mask public inside space"", would listen Tuskegee study one drivers need ethical approval medical research. awful sure isolated case. also ended 40 years ago. 

Calling vaccine expedited hand shitting couple years worth work done really smart highly educated people, mostly outside USA plain ignorant honestly. state (WA) anything go early summer general population access vaccine. Assuming takes months get vaccine everyone wants it, plus month take full effect, probably going late summer/start fall things returning normality. explain again? Weren‚Äôt 12 treated study one lived? many died?

Sorry I‚Äôm missing actual figure many people saved vs many died.

I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs good treatment. would never get tested. think hoax. thing. last 100 years, cover new strains become predominate ones society, close useless. great news...if everything basically stays same. Hey, Brazilian here.

I think concerns valid, since vaccination thing became political. hand, Sinovac bribing thing years ago, unrelated specific vaccine, probably due systemic corruption, making bribe almost necessity (we here, probably theses issues China too).

Talking press, independent press, Brazil dictatorship president actually kinda hated media. 

About vaccine, Butantan Institute, responsible conducting tests Brazil, respected institution producing medicines vaccines hundred years. related federal government, state government S√£o Paulo. I'd trust 100%.

That said, blindly trust strangers internet. research, read papers, whatever makes feel safe. course can‚Äôt overtake them. tried answer question numbers. Ah there's actually two Sussex county's Southeast England, UK. live West Sussex there's East Sussex Mid-Sussex, middle area separates county's. Hope clears stuff up. Pelosi yell Republicans distance beginning Actually looks like Amazon ~$15 great! months ago almost impossible find $50 sounds like you‚Äôre talking ass much claim need day day hasn‚Äôt changed since march. good constant panic do?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* long Pfizer one? Bye bye Felicia really agree with. People generally they're told, told enough. transmission rates decrease lower lower levels people vaccinated. think that's meant.

It's continuum people acquiring immunity infections slowing. Shit, thanks reminding me. walking around mask everywhere never cleaning hands. Bolsonaro might believe otherwise, Brazil dissimilar major authoritarian governments. independent press tests conducted international oversight. shouting totalitarian tendencies change that, plus little support.

In case, biggest danger president pressures Anvisa (our FDA) sabotage Coronavac's certification, way around. No. mo going intensive care covid gives 1-in-3 chance dying. unpronounceable drugs reduce 1-in-4. treat 12 patients save another life. 

Importantly drugs hasten recovery, increases turnover beds. important capacity approached. serious. Hence /s sarcasm Happy cake day! No, guys, it! see relevant.

Well.. sarcastic. Usually post Israel media, someone jumps victimize Palestinians, matter what.  Ok thanks answer. people downvote question conjecture, saw, lot people went get tested prior Christmas Holiday err safe side visiting family... would course get lot positives asymptomatic presymptomatic people would boost numbers bit period... 

A lot people get tested reasons time went infect others gatherings, plays roll current phase pandemic. Thank much kind stranger. Hope life treats well. ◊û◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ñ ◊î◊û◊ú◊ö Guess you‚Äôre American. know proven right?

Just look names phase 1/2 papers. Brazilian names? Yeah, commented mom thing tight Looks like South Africa joining production Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. I'd honestly rather give doses local managers' friends doses sit freezers indefinitely shits giggles, seems like happening now. Jesus H. said naturally acquire immunity better vaccine-conferred immunity.

I fucking say better get virus vaccine, I? know. hearing front line workers state rejecting vaccine kills soul. research there. vaccine safe No. number needed treat save one critically ill patient would otherwise died 12. Treat 12 ICU patients average one person live would otherwise died. That‚Äôs actually good. 50 years ago. country near intellegent back then. Yesterday already proved that

Ah yes, right around time doctors prescribed thalidomide pregnant mothers created babies horrific side effects. days. must secret menu thank work I‚Äôve suggested one couple patients it‚Äôs like $15 fairly accurate. People reported quick delivery (a day two) also: nothing company, think it‚Äôs ridiculous people pay something easy find $10-$15 prior covid)

Anyway, good luck! hope feel better soon questions? South Africa acquiring Oxford/AstraZeneca (was trialed here) Pfizer J &amp; J. possibility producing locally via Aspen. got lucky COVID. Yes, got bit unlucky asymptomatic transmission, many diseases history been: deadly, contagious, harder treat current technology.

We happened get complete slam dunk COVID vaccines, vaccine vaccine working beautifully months months earlier anticipated. headline gonna get lot mileage days/ weeks/ months come... üëç I'm ready camp line. tell where.  Teachers Reddit love martyrs weird debate. 

Truthfully, I‚Äôve seen ONE qualified person say may able evade vaccine, one type vaccine, type Pfizer Moderna are. 

Again, order Pfizer Moderna work, virus would lose entire spike protein. 

I can‚Äôt help feel like r/coronavirus hype created people anxiety. Maybe someone explain outsider Newsom seems stubborn smart, knows restrictions going hurt point he'll prob drop true. TGA looking approval them. provide 89% protection 21 days, first dose, according Table 1, March. sure miss coffee brewing! would roughly 30M doses behind supply. nearly good enough. Supply limiting factor Dr John Campbell made great videos topic. Highly recommend watching vids. It‚Äôs definitely high. Seen reports closer 40%  Narrator = Morgan Freeman Prioritization fine, leaving logistics hundreds different companies health systems manage disastrous.  transmissible deadly, roundabout way like count calculate. risk death technically ends worse among population obliterate health care. transmissible patients less health care death. sucks, hope it‚Äôs improving! have, okay go king Ethyl alcohol, 40% solution. Meanwhile U.S.A vaccinating slow leave vaccines counter make room freezers. need get vaccine moving faster virus keep fucking mutations faster vaccine. 

If stop fucking this. problem virus host. Nope. Healthcare first completely correct. know person died got covid hospital healing surgery. Nobody else got contact besides hospital workers.

This prevents virusbfrom circulating hospitals causing outbreaks people difficult situation. competency? bullshit complete bullshit. Many support people run businesses etc young people. Get head ass. really want go there? anaphylaxis. people usually carry epi pen sounds much like ~Communism~ America's liking Vaccinating frontline healthcare first makes sense. Can‚Äôt tell disruptive pandemic response outbreak covid among staff ER. aren‚Äôt many us frontline workers.

Who fathoming that? think might fruitless discuss. seems reading comprehension problem. don‚Äôt know try read foreign language, let translate source:


¬´On national basis, 5.4 per cent planned operations postponed second four-month period 2020. decrease second four-month period 2019, 5.9 per cent planned operations postponed. second four-month period 2020, Helse Nord RHF highest share 6.7 per cent. Helse Vest RHF lowest share 4.5 per cent.¬ª

In years 2015-2019, share national basis 5.3 per cent 6.1 per cent (annual data). Helse Vest RHF has, period, always lowest regions.¬ª

In essence: business usual. many reasons surgeries postponed. Covid 0 impact. Actually less surgeries postponed 2020 2019.

Do get it? people okay letting nurses, first responders, nursing home patients go first too. speed fact may benefited Trump? seem shifting goal post. Idk don‚Äôt know 
But know it‚Äôs death rate multiple times worse it‚Äôs neighbors OK. Go ahead tell CA hospital front line workers things really aren‚Äôt bad. COVID-19 vaccine request similar yellow fever vaccine request is, won‚Äôt matter specific vaccine took long got vaccine international medical agency deemed effective. many countries yellow fever vaccinations mandatory request show document got yellow fever vaccine, specific one general one many different companies make YF vaccine using similar vaccine design technology. botched study point wish national emergency approval. EU slow Moderna shipping negligible amounts Q2. Meanwhile new variant keeps spreading faster UK Denmark probably everywhere else. may vaccinate vulnerable Q1 UK hospitals already overwhelmed younger people may case everywhere soon. one county ohio actually. I'm houses...old county zip, new county google form. know piecemeal logistics response going efficient what's happening. course hit hard. weren‚Äôt even concerned people would get Covid, would make church.

Now they‚Äôve concluded follow CDC advice. even debate? wonder it‚Äôs mess.

I also don‚Äôt like simply say ‚Äúa church members died.‚Äù think many actually... what? Plenty parts Canada much much lower death rates 
And average much lower death rate 
Way cherry pick family member died alone covid last week. 

Believe me, want work.

But I‚Äôm hesitant trust political leaders, organizations, business leaders got us shitshow first place also give us working vaccine time... it‚Äôs hard pill swallow. That's said press conference. ever gets point drafted law would willing bet exceptions. buy it, deserves problem two groups holding second dose reserve. hospitals holding reserve knowing vaccinated smart. federal government holding half reserve second stupid. means sitting 75% vaccines nothing.  Sinovac Sinopharm possibly Sputnik V going vaccines widely used Eastern Europe, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands.

Only first world countries (Western Europe, England-offshoot nations, Tier 1 Asian states) able afford Moderna/BiontechPfizer/OxfordAstrazenaza vaccines.  Come back understand relative risk. sure one allowed live society without abiding certain contracts society. i‚Äôm sure basic misunderstanding here. thought coronaviruses spike proteins, hence name. surely mRNA vaccines aren‚Äôt effectively vaccinating *every* coronavirus, right? anyone thinks positive outcome, going disagree. means general public pushed back true end sight longer.  According governor 100% efficacy severe cases. Well, current vaccine timeline 1 million day potentially...  also happen mosques? thats orgs going point. insurance begin cover non vaxx'ed people. would surprised many people actually considerate towards surroundings black community distrust medication higher rate general population? MMR vaccine? Flu shot? Assuming 195 places report deaths correctly. Many places either means test keep track everybody, underreport make look better.

Sweden less excess deaths official death count, said countries? really sino-brazilian, Butantan Institute conducted trials, influence vaccine's technology. Feel free correct me. Sweden less restrictions mask usage less deaths Quebec mask usage heavy restrictions ( private gathering all, curfew, ...)  don‚Äôt trust science think others won‚Äôt well? Got it. Keep spreading distrust, surely helps cause! Unfortunately happening - guy uni assaulted Tottenham court road racists blaming virus Well know 3-4 people want 7 declined. Possibly ones hit ‚Äúreply all‚Äù. Seems like fair estimate sample size gather office admin spoke confirmed nurses declined. all, whole thing shows government incapable ""planning ahead"", basically inactive something hit face, scramble put together plan, often inadequate rushed.

the US **should** way prepared, literally 2 months prepare stockpile PPE implement sensible prevention policies, luxury China have. quietest seen thread deaths Sweden long long time

thanks u/atealein posting adding context without polarizing politicizing. holidays certainly skewed things, easy people making seem. know tough storage conditions Pfizer, also require different amounts (0.3ml Pfizer, 0.5ml Moderna), they're coming premeasured syringes. need trained, certified practitioners administer vaccines. 

That said, incompetent fucks WH using DPA make single dose syringes, and/or training hundreds thousands people properly administer vaccine. way pharmacist could watching 5 6 people instead everything themselves.  Micromanaging on-site administration vaccines make process slower name rooting inconsequential amounts fraud. examples doses going waste enough prioritized people show examples people gaming system, latter case least someone vaccinated. strictest rules, guidelines recommendations. many people cited mass gatherings non masks? many people cited quarantine? many people cited reporting cases stores? get flu shot every year I'm vector others unable get it. wear mask reason. [Here's graphic breaking phases rollout anyone wondering they'll receive Hopefully get clarity phase begin soon. read something requirement BSL-3 lab produce vaccine. sure prevalent is. what? isn‚Äôt true all. First, masks protect others wearing mask. wear mask myself, fellow citizens; virus don‚Äôt want transmit anyone else.

If everyone gave fuck fellow man weren‚Äôt self-serving may easier time pandemic. 

Same goes vaccines. Yes, protect you, 50% population gets vaccine unable get vaccine - due allergy/medical conditions - way susceptible. Also, less people vaccinated means virus stays around longer increases likelihood mutations vaccine may create immunity for, we‚Äôre back square one. 

Everyone needs start giving least somewhat fuck people. Yeah, problem. I'm saying likely happen people, possible, happens, suck fat one. Yes, please don‚Äôt take safe, practically free medications prevent disease prevent unless you‚Äôve cleared doctor. countries territories don‚Äôt need herd immunity get back normal life. need hospitalizations decrease level we‚Äôre worried overwhelmed Quebec higher death rate Sweden, way restrictions. Canada Europe approving it? 

It's vaccine. 

Also drugs approved profit companies, take drugs vaccines? think went overboard, gave hospitals hospitals know many needed even though alot people need understand POV, however statistically MUCH better chance recovery. 80, you‚Äôd probably dead vent already. disease horrible everyone, preserve amount life possible, it‚Äôs essential vaccinate vulnerable first. 

I hope feel better. Don‚Äôt hesitate go hospital. don‚Äôt pulse ox home, highly suggest order one ASAP (they‚Äôre $20-$50 days be, still cheap considering literally save life). Good luck censor yourself? swear, ones going give shit. Yes please!!!!! Vaccinating rich people? lol  78% efficacy mild cases 100% severe cases Except NY Cuomo fine $1m Yeah. want control people themselves. Every company produces flu vaccine could theoretically produce this. would manufacture license, pandemic would end Summer... like higher Ed contact 100‚Äôs people don‚Äôt get general public ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è gonna run vaccine deniers suddenly sees people close die.

(me though) you‚Äôre Colorado Springs, go Freddy‚Äôs instead. It‚Äôs way better In-N-Out Idk gonna lock arms 6ft apart Lol makes sense me. I've learned science always logical.  That's article's hypothetical believe vaccines generate big immune response body acts virus different ways, new shots probably still work

It definitely wrong time give decide live virus. vaccines scaled exponentially. can't overload hospitals meantime, Porsche. vaccine help people get back normal life Yeah including non-entities like Wallis Futuna here, separating Isle Man UK, inflates numbers. doubt 4-5 times anymore (it probably spring), I'd bet overall we've caught less 1 3. I'd say anywhere 60-80 million people already ""vaccinated."" We'll see makes difference soon enough guess. see another example people reading headline filling think said. article: feel need grounded evidence relation recommendations, **but totally acknowledge countries may see needs even flexible terms administration second dose**,‚Äù said Dr Joachim Hombach, executive secretary WHO‚Äôs important note little empiric data trials underpin type Kate O‚ÄôBrien, another member WHO‚Äôs working group, said hoped see data. ‚ÄúI think emphasise need additional evidence. recommending body entirety evidence tells us clear full answer policy questions. **And nature policymaking must make recommendations based imperfect trade-off two risks**, said. Sticking scrupulously timing vaccines trial evidence could limit number people get first doses. second risk delay people getting booster shot. Lol. How‚Äôs koolaid taste? wait: new number calendar magically putting end kind thinking/expectation/reality? American. went good public school read lot British literature guess. yes feels pointless, seeing read Norwegian fine don't. still keep posting misinformation like *Covid 0 impact.*

How even possible think? jab Sweden way? Looking many comments dedicated Sweden last year frightening. obsession?

Let's end end, still death toll 6-12 times higher neighbours.

At time wrote Sweden 5.2 times cumulative deaths Denmark, I'm assuming meant *6*. 3.5 times. even make statements absolute certainty like that?

Anyway hope stop wishing people die prove point handcuffed to, stay positive healthy wishing others. they‚Äôre administered ASAP amount vials fridges doesn‚Äôt really help us much. don‚Äôt get one there‚Äôs enough supply administered community, good. I‚Äôd interested excess deaths increase admissions palliative care headline Covid figures would outright fabricating every bit public information vaccine distribution order prioritization. Current CDC recommendation pregnant women get vaccine. announced November. Later start, decent amount start (enough 25% population march). think August target finish date..... think Canada like Sept/Oct. Yay! Congratulations!! Australia population similar large US state population much compliant say US UK.

We done still discussing emails.

I expect Aussie borders closed time regardless fast vacinate. Given need data back claims like this, seeing "" couple years "" data, complete Bullshit. vaccine 5-6 collective months data, 1/5 data needed make absurd claim like this. Idk. Stronger odor? wouldn't.  Many states it. list millions long sad. We‚Äôll see suspect we'll first country let vaccine expire administered.

Don't worry, plenty incompetent governments achieve first, like Brazil. Source: Brazilian. mean, biggest vaccine rollout ever, happened right middle biggest holiday year, Christmas. course slow beginning. think people refusing feel risk group take them? Ive read comments healthcare workers getting vaccine sounds like survivors guilt advantage using chemical normal everyday product? I've usually sniffing lotion check. Seriously. Make app. Hire one zillion massive tech companies country make national COVID vaccine sign app. Give 6+ months lots money extremely secure. Hire another company logistics distribution.

This workshopped simulated thousands times. Instead they're random people send random amounts vaccines hospitals. friend runs nursing homes Alameda, CA told yesterday according CVS weren‚Äôt going get vaccine March. I‚Äôm calling bullshit article I'm kidding, picturing virologist reading getting straight study! believe it. Stock market rallying time highs. knows best, clearly nothing important. Well, enjoy ""Vaccine Black Friday"" then, good luck! don‚Äôt think best way reduce fatalities + hospitalizations, guess it‚Äôs next best option. don‚Äôt understand whoever supposed distribute/administer vaccines didn‚Äôt figured MONTHS vaccines approved. Seems right. Covid deaths minus less deaths respiratory infections like flu, less accidental deaths traffic alcohol. probably excess deaths first half 2021 though, enough vaccines come around. least numbers FHM presented couple times per week. numbers Socialstyrelsen present maybe month goes death certifiate. Check one posts atealein ...fuck healthcare workers sick dying unable take care ill? Great plan. realize healthcare workers unlimited resource, right? Hospitals already struggling providing skilled physicians care critically ill. Why? Ship someone follow politics, restrictions follow majoritarian public opinion actual good practice cases. opinion changes restrictions will. There‚Äôs always small minority asking anything sun, government doesn‚Äôt listen them. listen ~2% want heavy restrictions following drop cases deaths? Dunno, maybe religious practice ensures people spaced apart anyway looking towards floor rather sides sprays less. Need science one. Good him. mild flu? hope never experience experienced. store talking about? 

Really hard eat restaurant mask on. Also gym people working without masks. would ordered? doesnt really power hospitals do, cant force hospitals staff continue giving vaccine. would think, seem approach taken officials right now. It'll interesting see restrictions change time. start big debate whether lockdowns ""worth it."" imagine we'll new debate consequences opening decrease threat hospitals wanes. vaccine safe pregnant women? nursing home town work got vaccinated last week like clockwork, staff called 911 every resident got fever night next morning.  
It took IIAF(Firefighters union) step pressure state getting first responders general vaccinated, firefighters.  
I lucky enough gotten mine medical control hospital someone pulled many doses mistake. congressmen weren‚Äôt wearing masks speeches. I‚Äôll let guess party part of. can't believe come this. COVID excruciating way die, imagine leaving someone suffer like that. move Israel? Obviously steps a) attempt find vulnerable populations need; b) give anyone wants danger expiring. point simply can‚Äôt make policy give anyone vulnerable give rise perpetuation already massive problem rich getting better care poor. case (and healthcare cases) poor much vulnerable, giving vaccine highest bidder isn‚Äôt especially productive solving problems have. current rate operational false-positive swab tests UK unknown; preliminary estimates show could somewhere 0¬∑8% 4¬∑0%. rate could translate significant proportion false-positive results daily due current low prevalence virus UK population, adversely affecting positive predictive value test Exactly! people giving scientific credence CEO company claiming product competitive advantage without proof.....that's job promote product make company money got shot 1 yesterday!! already feel like weight back. isn‚Äôt helping anything got 24th well ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è lot better tho!  There's plenty go around. Whatever makes get butts actually give out. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs necessarily nurses doctors, hierarchy. tends minorities disadvantaged groups, heard prior exploitations Needs single rider line like Disneyland lmao. Hospital sets daily vaccination target go stock reasonable pace. prioritize whoever want day 2pm see aren‚Äôt gonna reach target, start hitting random volunteers. FAIRY GODPARENTS!!! I‚Äôm terribly surprised. expect many fall group get vaccinated want wait see first. otherwise ordinary safety profile clear preventative effects speak time Watch live feed, not. least open anyone 55 groups like teachers stuff. Anybody know is? touch sky news UK variant sounds bit catchy ""Corona mutation first discovered UK"" Ill lock arms whoever wants go yellow brick road me. Ill skip sing dance get shot done. vaxes contain actual virus. Instead, encoded protein coat virus. new strain protein coat, change due mutation less likely. It'll still work mutations there. relax restrictions

no one could predicted  I‚Äôm honestly concerned well-being, sounds like things pretty rough you, support make easier. Please PLEASE watch breathing (which highly suggest pulse ox home). disease pretty crazy, see patients o2 sats 50‚Äôs 60‚Äôs say feel pretty much okay even though virtually disease sats like would gasping air/passing out. truly alone support, please make sure tools need take care know get hospital. physician might able order pulse ox, send straight house charge insurance. healthcare provider decent relationship with? part country in? Unfortunately, US way past controlled. VARIANTS! 9 months I've seen grand total two people store wearing masks required. Japan 30 times less deaths per Capita Western Nations biggest elderly population world proportionately.

If complacency looks like, would like try it, please.

I hope Japanese government able put second wave control. need one centralized logistical coordination demand tied supply. 50 separate organizing approaches clusterfuck slowing everything  know what‚Äôs reported. That‚Äôs fact. 
You one claiming actual numbers wrong means pfizer stonks go Covid barely relevant... music ears Alot pretty much guaranteed investment. Typically enough investment investment coming quick enough vaccines. alot time spent trying get funding etc. think ran trials parallel alongside other. Although pfizer/moderna whole brand new type vaccine. We've never mRNA vaccines atleast approved ones available general public know moderna vaccine atleast design created within 2 days back think may due mRNA vaccines work potentially speed whole process abit Normal inmunity body kills dog looks like dog sketch. Moderna inmunity works killing anything x color shape shoes. tested, participated Arizona objection debate. Received results the... ""protest"" quarantined. definitely already everywhere, around since September like sequence every test variant is. here, seeing us variant. people vaccinated every day. body produce melatonin naturally? supplementing, eventually become dependent sleep cause body shuts natural production?

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I'm extrapolating experience cannabis, it'll spike melatonin levels regular users often difficulty sleeping without cannabis several days stopping use. doctor, curious - maybe 5mg enough tolerance build. You‚Äôre bit behind science.

There evidence produces greater viral load. Quite simply lie. surprise. What's take vaccine? Florida definitely ""back normal"" There's restrictions right AFAIK Luckily one  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Stopping people well good stop permanent organ damage etc. Hey I‚Äôm apart numbers! got right holidays got see zero family!! Woohoo! Internet stranger, hope get vaccine soon safely ! They‚Äôll still work. We‚Äôll know couple weeks. 

And soon issue put bed, media stir something else ‚Äúexperts worried about‚Äù. take stride, focus getting next months mass vaccination we‚Äôll far better off. Average doesn‚Äôt really mean much country 328 million people. Apartments live average 3k/month minimum wage $7.35. brother law lives rural area states up, minimum wage apartment $400/month. know people said similar things Remdesivir ended boondoggle. spend June - September almost covid-free, states complete disaster. That's something. Interesting!  Thats experience it. got yesterday I've sore arm general feeling body stuff vaccine introduced to. woke feeling bit hung body's temperature control kind wacky rest yesterday. fever though I'm fairly certain dont virus. vaccine wacky stuff body. Overall still recommend people get it. likely going deal momentary discomfort exchange protection virus potentially kill you. think fair trade. People justifying line-jumping vaccine literally saying: ""The old vulnerable stay home!""

My head spinning.  Hasn‚Äôt White House fucked Corona virus response enough? STFU. Front lines first, essential, every one else. vaccine ubiquitous everyone. answer 3 developers revamped one company's websites, migrating tons data new system changing entire front end, since pandemic started.

Surely government dev team could created simple vaccine sign-up time. Government sucks, people suck ignoring guidelines. exactly. agree 100% seen pictures doctors / nurses dead Covid, ""complete board"". city, man voluntered died receive legion d'honneur. I'd assume moderate case statistically unlikely major consequences caught again. I'll continue part preventing spread see reason vaccinated point. kind idiot get excited fucking burger middle pandemic? 

People want sense normalcy? I'm anti-social anyone, even I'm going insane going work coming home nothing 9.5 months. Deep South already back normal business, tbh. :P would great Europe, since didn‚Äôt order much moderna.

Now need J&amp;J Also vaccines created equally. fact current vaccines immunize single viral protein make especially vulnerable escape via mutagenesis. Whereas immune response attenuated virus vaccines natural infection broad across variety antigens. would expect virus gain resistance current vaccines, previous natural infection much better off. Early February guess, although could see approved month. I've read Italian French health ministers pressuring late January authorisation. That's honestly better expected.  Eh. Indoors thats kinda subpar anyway. Airflow blah blah. little. I'm seen announce presence yet. fact post hundreds upvotes gold sitting 4 upvotes tells everything need know sub. 

The original comment likely written undergrad student C+ immunology 101. around 430,000 people returned since mid-March, Australia closed border, 39,000 remain stranded overseas. number risen despite government stepping repatriation efforts

The number *risen*? people still choosing travel AUS / NZ expecting repatriated? literally excuse this. something either government allowing way subsidizing? Seriously, fuck anyone putting position. Let idiots wait indefinitely elsewhere. Interesting. Can‚Äôt recall anything really special summer 2018 forest fires. would thought rainy summer would dangerous traffic. u/tb0x Wtf? feel like states going expand pool ot people get soon. think offer everyone point could sizable amount people refuse combination result herd immunity many people may get vaccinated. 19,816 new cases today's report - Total Cases: 1,429,722. **A change +2,033 yesterday's (17,783). change +2,624 last Thursday (17,192).** New 19,334 residents cases- Total Residents cases: 1,404,374, new 482 non-residents cases- Total Non-Residents cases: 25,348.

That's awesome Africa GREATLY neglected...

However would also great African countries, know developed ones, get back seat treatment time South Africa. likely yes. Likely definitely UK. South Africa one concerns, probably effect vaccinations large degree based this. treatments might effective however. GRAINS STRANDED STAINED ANTS. pretty well, population wears masks etc. new strain look well.

I think good idea issue declaration, get control pretty soon.

I concerned country, also furious planned start working March get hit restrictions can't enter now, probably able near future.

Edit: comments news like yahoo news YouTube channels japanese television chanels pretty harsh too.

They find good foreigners get barred demand Suga takes responsibility like slow unclear approach. (That's read) know something don‚Äôt ...

I mean, they're bunch scientists people specialize shit, I'd certainly hope there's lot know don't. Ok that's true I'd feel better, already system. Debatable, try one burgers you‚Äôll running Trump right along /s counties (Lee comes mind) started line versus appointment system. appointment systems buggy getting better. 

Nearly every day least one county/hospital opened new appointments state. point best friend signed everyone know Florida that's 65+

Several folks turned offer extra annoying can't get vaccinated do. 

If family Florida, HIGHLY recommend offering help computer savvy. like buying concert tickets, lot seats still need quick. Reading top comments, I'm seeing talking about. die seem different demographic military personnel.  paradox all.  however surprised number low 3 organization like Army. weeks old. bricks average age military 22.

The military preventive medicine.

The military public health.

The military masking, reduces viral dose.

The military fairly good diet.

The military fairly good exercise.

The military doesn‚Äôt keep around overweight troops, hold onto broken people.

And finally, it‚Äôs military alone spare capacity throughout pandemic, best access therapeutics. Pool COVID = nightmare fuel me. know lots people drank one energy drink day high school quitted easily someday. Can't say daily smokers. concerns kids getting it. know kids typically die, etc., since know long term effects, I'd prefer keep getting it. 10 under. understand trials going kids young 12. everyone 13 take essentially immunity could consider kids safe? &amp;#x200B;

Additional details updated order available finalized next day two.

For information COVID-19 activities areas, [Alameda](http://www.acphd.org/), [Contra [Santa [San [San COVID-19 websites. Walgeens pharmacist one patient report similar reaction. gave patient Benadryl precaution checked patient later day everything fine hard lockdown stop it, ones seeing anyone gonna get infected? shortage macro scale, micro-scale rollout resulted thousands doses sitting unused.

For example, live Maricopa Country - largest county Arizona 2/3 state's population. Yesterday THREE vaccination sites open county covers ***9,200 square miles*** ***4.5 million people.***

We vaccinated 3,000 people yesterday.

The whole system absolute mess: people can't get appointments, hard understand phase eligible in, county communicating well, enough vaccination sites open...the list problems goes on.

As yesterday, used **fewer 1/3 vaccine doses** sent, *just now* starting get shipments represent ""second doses"" vaccinated first wave. Surely expiring soon.

Do shortage? Yes. need vaccinating highest risk first? Yes, absolutely. also clear inventory quickly possible. means occasionally moving list people slightly lower priority accessible/available, it.

Arizona worst spot world covid-19 governor refuses anything, getting vaccines willing arms literally opportunity save citizens. something New Zealand experiencing well. can't book place quarantine next 75 days unless someone cancels. really consider excessive. Articles NZ shortage say caused shortage police, army nurse availability, shortage accommodation. going problem either country gets fully vaccinated likely 18 months away. people travel, situation going get worse. I'm pretty sure vaccines like flu vaccine come vials multiple doses. Agreed, incorrect. downvoted? provided evidence sequencing...  Honestly, suspected case March ""qualify"" testing (antibody negative however. Likely covid). doctor prescribed vitamin (at high dose, blood work showed nonexistent levels), melatonin, take allergy meds. think there's inklings worked while. First time I've ever glad body's response almost anything seems drown snot. agree premise, even pretty god damn silly hair splitting, given:

1) UK getting punished Britons 'discriminated' apparent least perceived epicenter UK variant, said punishment matters ordinary people. (Also, many countries UK indeed ""blamed"" least failed virus containment efforts, rightly wrongly.) 

2) Chinese government (not Chinese people) is, fact, blame lot (obviously everything.) They're blocking investigation efforts, maintain reforms necessary prevent repeat epidemic closely related SARS-CoV-1 virus outbreak 2003.

Even agreed premise, come close justifying double standard. 

As far premise goes: renaming COVID-19 China Virus implying blame, whether deserved not.

That's ahistorical. People definitely calling Wuhan virus, rarely Chinese coronavirus (when calling bland provisional label ""novel coronavirus"") long COVID-19 label invented. president invent concept referring virus apparent place origin. 

This descriptive long accusational. mean, calling Wuhan virus China virus also dumb stop people calling many months -\_- sigh work healthcare busy emergency department specializes comprehensive stroke center. would certainly explain I'm seeing: mildly symptomatic folks, sick people die us. right. However, English speakers pronounce /r/. sorry! connect iphone. Tussin cures everything. India cases hospital defaulted oxygen bill company cut air killing everyone. Straight Total Recall. Thank sharing this. Nicotine lot like caffeine far inherent risk, demonized causes cancer destroys livelihoods. govt cannot admit could saving grace nicotine, science there. quit smoking 8 years ago still vape flavorless, 3 mg juice, lungs feel MUCH better. Xenophobia towards Asian-Americans unfortunately nothing new. There's history people blaming pandemics even burning Chinatown point. Truly gross would think humanity would better no, last year huge wake call one gives shit Asian-Americans always need cautious. Yes, people dying. pandemic deadly serious.

Poor education also deadly serious. Education directly linked life expectancy.
 faced awful choice premature death covid premature death lack education. easy answers. Someone spreads near r0 rate spreader. definition. lot people fleeing lockdown orders. thing happened March. don‚Äôt want follow public health mandates, go place least doesn‚Äôt enforce little have? Remember remember orangeman lost November Yup. Unfortunately, people call still given nasty looks comments I've received, still blame anyone looks Asian it. -\_- everyone enough ruin day sometimes. Well well well.... us 60 riots last six months, that.

I'm happy y'all ain‚Äôt wrong Thankfully cautious! thank sharing experience, difficult symptom leading indicator we‚Äôre dealing something long incubation period. May ask, symptoms prompt get tested contact alert?   Yeah literally 100 countries immediately shut South Koreans entering February/March. make sense that's governments do. -\_- I'm talking Koreans sleep ground airports blocked entering sometimes. Government spends billions poor results, else new. could say every leader cautious still course (I'm sure are). Tested positive 2 weeks ago loss taste smell happen 2 days positive test. know means argue superspreaders. people like argue though. mean, can't trace strain originated from? That's discovered lot cases NY traveled Europe... capital got stormed terrorists. would guess Washington. AZ resident here.. people area wearing masks, everything else ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. see people working offices again, stores packed. Last week (from posted Instagram) people NYE restaurants &amp; bars. going get worse gets better. Exactly, people UK getting spat on, harassed, face slashed, beaten up, stabbed, called nasty comments like Asian-Americans have. hip care hate crimes towards Asians many year. may lucked too. Last year (pre-covid) Doc put Vitamin supplements nasal steroid spray. used benadryl bad allergy days (most them) melatonin help sleep.

All least theorized fight covid. covid prevent cocktail going sheer dumb luck. arguing semantics.

 I'm correcting. calling argument. least matter perspective. word ""superspreader"" used people understand meaning. Happens lot r/news . neat sounding word suddenly develops lots meanings never existed before. not. perfect pronunciation: Wife pretty mild case, 14 days since tested positive. Loss taste smell started 2 days testing positive still gotten back fully, though improving slowly. shit. offense I'm Korean-American literally got spat someone spray liquid face March. parents got harassed well...and first thing family March call relatives tell careful going outside, virus, hate crimes. People also harassed verbally, gave nasty looks, would fake cough mutter ""corona,"" sit next public transportation. really doubt people UK would treated way, considering Italians treated like shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not mention countless hate crimes Asian-Americans faced. That's difference. Thanks ‚Äúcollective‚Äù comment regarding country filled hundreds millions people think different many ways. PA refused vaccines Israel. want Russian one Reminds reason called 'Spanish Flu' Oxford vaccine much easier administer people age groups whose mobility severely impaired. 10k+ people Capitol around entire country. Cataclysmic spreader event No, accepted attitude lives people lossed okay because, people older sick. Trying equate two situations stretch, course could caused vaccine may related that's whole point investigation. % think turned down? there's one thing I've learned whole thing, sometimes waiting data taking drastic action means waited long. Like couple weeks Thanksgiving... Canad√° records death positive covid test COVID death, removes sufficient evidence comes light wasn‚Äôt. Ontario they‚Äôve said 2-3 20 year olds died last month. Reality 2 weren‚Äôt COVID-related, one never actually died. reverse need be. Still waiting Tussin study come ...s/ far apart positives? ever test negative? tested positive 4 months getting negative test 5 months first positive. believe however I‚Äôm curious time line. Calling ""super covid"" dangerous awful journalism whoever wrote ashamed.

Not say worthy worry, blatant fear-mongering. articles like give credibility covid deniers necessarily issue denying illegal immigrants government benefits, yeah, COVID give crap immigration status. decision beyond me. LOL, everyone quick blame jump China yet get scared country get blamed ""oh no, might mutated somewhere else."" makes think that's case China well then? also really good scientists. traces COVID found Spain Brazil earlier last year.

&amp;#x200B;

It's totally pointless point fingers COVID know might never really know. What's important government response, react this. Hell broke capital nows perfect time steal vaccines. face minimum resistance able save lives /s (sorta maybe) Whatever uni means nothing skilled locals actually lived environment know ppl think. actually exceptional talent particular skill get in. Even countries Asia. prioritize local graduates, probably Oxford Cambridge degree. still something can't find within local job pool. yeah got degree matter people going start bringing drinks bars? Meanwhile Belgium, vaccines made
: vaccine strategy? Uhm. take slow sure. negligence intentional harm.

You‚Äôre missing point huge outliers history allergies. anWhy would reason sue? would someone previous allergies knowingly takes vaccine, able sue. know possible risks already experiencing them. 

Why takeaway here? makes sense me.

Maybe credit given record development highly effective vaccines infinitesimal risk harm.

Most people won‚Äôt entitled months anyway. you‚Äôre scared anti-vaccines, months data millions doses given gets you. Desperation often leads stupid mistakes. Hope one Thank practical logical input. ......China one got 80k cases.... amount get every 8 hours?  Absolutely. issue statement small help. stop virus pyramid things need do, without one falls important. Distancing, Masks, isolation, testing, contract tracing.

All aimed get reproduction rate virus low practicable.

They big help part integrated solution distancing etc. russia nurses get thrown fucking window; proven causation, nonetheless Florida relatively sunny state Vitamin deficiency less common.

Regardless, many cases would assume death rate climb anyway. Wut. Terrific. vaccine you? bad allergy person ...he/ fucked covid response day one; people died would've far likely alive today controlled thing day one. mean, he‚Äôs kind right. 

A vaccine little bit COVID. munch smaller chance death. Really glad colleges going starting back up. Totally gonna go well. Yea state 30% positivity I‚Äôm sure probably states similar worse. missing sooo many infections risk vaccine.. really injected drug. people administering shot supposed sit watch person minute see allergic reaction. say anything masks. age well..... capital hill attemtped rheichstag fire .... Yeah think good argument say double standard WHO's naming convention sure - actually didnt know formally named virus COVID-19.

Right now, people two options refer UK Variant:

1. official name: 
SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01

2. UK Variant.

People go #2, assign blame choice names available.

With COVID-19, people three options refer it:

1. official name: SARS-CoV-2
2. WHO's name: COVID-19
3. reference China: China Virus Wuhan Virus

People choose refer COVID-19 China Virus instead COVID-19 actively assign blame....why else would given geographical neutral name, unlike UK variant?

With said, take points youve made bigger picture (ie thosr around China's growing influence world).....I realize Im taking lot time arguing one particular detail (ie intent behind referring virus). yeah honestly wonder thats whats spreading work bc feels like wildfire still get leeches applied blood let? saying never update information comes live distant past it. Either live peasant hateful liar. it? ...haha attempted overthrown governments wannabe dicators.... small world eh. I've noticed fair number acquaintances apparently feel they're special need vacations everyone else they're traveling Southern CA, FL TX üôÑ Ummm.... arm injecting into. They're also utilizing good ideas like repurposing arenas public squares vax centers. 

Apparently also got religious leaders board science, meaning lot religious groups much eager get vaccine. people vaccinated better everyone, whether understanding science, following religion. 

Mainly, though, health system suitable serve big population 21st century ours. Nationalized digitized, everyone health insurance. much efficient US. well done nurses! friend lost sense taste swears tested negative it‚Äôs sinus infection. SoCal. believe nanosecond. proof? isn‚Äôt age best way? Certainly vaccinating 60+ eliminate deaths far? healthy 20 year old near-zero risk, 80s 1-in-10 risk dying.

This sub filled holier-than-thou posters year claiming they're selfless saints want protect vulnerable.

The moment vaccine arrived suddenly: ""Gimme gimme"". live Japan. One thing they've done remarkable job shielding old people away it. Pretty much every day 20-something 30-somethings highest number cases nation. kept deaths 4000. means people got infected people died. brother physician LA county says patients usually come around day 5. welcome. Victoria really good job fighting back second wave. NsW looks like better too. benefits politicians look good media helping nurses publically make huge headlines understand. family member works long term care facility. first one vaccine clinic scheduled mid February today I‚Äôm taking threats revolution granted. opposed sovereign country ruled Egyptians post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Say ain't so? Yeah exactly, semi hyperbolic. US artificially capping number vaccines distributed. course, fact healthcare system overwhelmed doesn‚Äôt help. He's saying resultant immunity better, better actually get sick. let ""what couple mean"" debate commence I'd like see acknowledge allergic reactions we've seen past moth ""long term effects"". Lol South America. country saying they‚Äôll start roll vaccines February frontline workers, don‚Äôt plan store Pfizer vaccine tropical country things: vaccines efficient natural infections, single dose Moderna contain enough mRNA produce millions spike proteins, proteins attached actual virus, much virus would probably kill you. (The typical infectious dosage believed several hundred several thousand virons). Also, vaccines two dose. first one teach body recognize virus protein. second one teach body pathogen hanging around while, immune system better catalogue ""long-term threat"" folder. Long-last immune response cemented repeated exposure. Also see together. Many likely covid recently  fear live it. math seems age people prematurely.  Great news want cut line, I'm saying would rather vaccine anyone's arm sitting shelf. get point shortage vaccines, sure ration it, give whomever.  vaccine expedited would mean entire stages testing skipped. Nothing skipped, lot money table funding stop years trials. reality that, novel coronavirus turned 1 year old; difficult know long immunity last; 

The vaccines studies done months, significant extrapolation go that.

That's actually closer Israeli priority list age, also important figures like generals, chiefs police etc also got priority obvious reasons. personal circumstances, expertise irrelevant.

Absolutely. difference lot doctors, nurses, general medical professionals state less public vaccine safe. get listened medical professionals.

And people believe exact reason. essential know doctor nurse, expert also story UK vaccine launch, harmed 2 medics allergic histories, issue warning people.

Sure bud. Good story 
194 ? Yes, Countries since mid april fewer restrictions across board, see analysis done Oxford researchers reported website ourworldindata, plus nowhere near populated Sweden, expecially Stockholm (which compared crowded cities Europe).

Sweden dream Country covid, nowhere near trying imply. Seems Ottawa slow distributing provinces. Quebec used doses actually received, I'm fairly certain Ontario well. selfish me, doesn‚Äôt bother all. means family, sooner. really worse 195 places. I'm sure many poorer countries vastly under-reporting cases deaths. Pfizer's trials lead warning people allergies. So, entirely insufficient true though. SA variant includes mutation reduces antibody recognition virus. means young person's immune system (which usually functions well enough keep virus check), need stronger response reduction overall virus patient. 

Now mean virus going suddenly cut swathe younger people, tax immune system slightly more. mean fairly common literature growing 90s. I'm Canadian. disagree. Restrictions make sense. Requiring mask times nothing (e.g., outside, bits food restaurant) makes whole order look ridiculous reduces compliance.  Working essential job ""resuming normal life"" two very, different things. I‚Äôm going hold breath vaccines start impacting numbers I'll guy GDP rebounded second quarter. wild assume ""two weeks"" mean ""about 3 months""? Seems standard countries begin lockdowns... Yup, key factor, analysis mortality always count excess deaths. Sweden really good reporting them, real mortality rate matter years study, quick check worldometer. transparent people ask questions get disappeared, eh-hem, became transparent themselves. may help bring doses you.

Kidding aside, absolutely nobody care one got long while, ever. Right, maybe refusers travel, impact Ya think!?! Must nice (in American). Turns out, every country entitled jerks don‚Äôt care anyone themselves! TL;DR: blames holiday period slow vaccination process hopes things improve next weeks. What's source that? Jew knows number Chasidic Jews, that's patently false Let‚Äôs see actual number ? Fortnight common English outside North America. saying this? virus spread interaction people.

Interesting, I've seen epidemic higher level contagion lower mortality rate like h1n1. is, far I‚Äôve read. yet developed differently ways seem impact 1 100,000.

Good them. makes sense strategy failing severely right now. Use vaccines every person vaccinated worth ending pandemic last mean always linked education, less access intentionally unintentionally higher chance understanding science. Scroll ""cases mortality per country"". bar chart top page shows 20 countries ""most effected"" (not sure chosen, deaths per capita). Agreed. seem reminding lot people lately vaccines magical shield PREVENTS infection. concept body learns recognize infection knows able take hold cause problem -- mean virus can't still get body replicate handful cells immune system stops it. mean still spreading germs around fight either. Still, mean spreading LESS germs, hopefully means taking hospital bed might otherwise.

Even immunity inferred measured months... big weapon. People infectious hours days opposed week huge difference. concept person gets exposed might spread anyone overnight time takes fight off, opposed spreading everywhere go 5-10 days significantly better. that's best get, that's still bad, important remember still second volley virus (the first hand washing sanitizer). best defense far wearing masks social distancing. Vaccines chance start beating virus back. Alone, they're enough stop it, no. start pushing back... Better testing help us set better defenses it, continuing combine things going stop stopped... battle attrition. Every hole defense exploited. Yeah, impression going case countries. We've hearing year vaccine production main bottleneck. part antibody decay pretty sure right now, many tests seen that.
The interesting part vaccine updates cover antibody evasion. E484K first test this. too, plus biologic medication mean body won‚Äôt induce cytokine storm Well yeah, anyone infection antibodies. Why? know fact every single one expert calling agrees him.

In Netherlands way first nine weeks first wave (weeks 11 19), almost 9 thousand deaths would normally expected period. first nine weeks second wave (weeks 39 47), excess mortality stood estimated 3.9 thousand. [statistics excess deaths first wave 3900 second wave week 47. time reported total: **7463** Yes, users get free awards Reddit. likely free award user Reddit lol feel like going around circles Unfortunately give vaccine 65+ first health care workers hurting minorities ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wow, love image. Crazy good. really many people protests. Nothing comparison number people involved Christmas gatherings nationwide. would make logistics much easier, though think 6 months would always aggressively low estimate. 12-24 months often hear guestimate .. really much different honest, least mild reassurance especially short interval.

Even 24 months good though vaccines use public large outperform ton. Even 2 year constant vaccination life would ton vaccination people get hard keep coming back.

My hope likely case lasts 12-24 months develop longer lasting one, even every 2-3 5 years prove big pain ass virus infectious. Especially consider low vaccine rates likely form bubbles similar minded communities outbreaks still easy RO stays high gets even higher looking recent trends. Palestinians responsibility Palestinian authority healthcare system, paid Palestinian taxes.

Meanwhile Israel first responsibility population, Arabs included. appropriate, far better approach. Vaccinate many high risk people possible fast possible. number 1 risk factor age. Maybe done 75+ start with, going age alone far best approach. 3,865 Americans died COVID-19 

Saved click. course happening. Foreign countries give sh\*\*\* race admit borders: vaccine, entry. still see 26 dying age 35. 

If going play data say certain deaths truly matter count 35, why? see helps us way. Incredible Yep think trade vaccinating risk vs. spreading it. think generally different people.

Because risk concentrated people think makes sense try vaccinate first. Especially nursing home residents -- mean going anywhere 1.5 million nationwide. sure already done, though areas. alone 40% risk.

A lot people realize heavily fatalities skewed elderly. actually big advantage vaccination standpoint. backlog? Germany tested almost half amount normal, backlog, missing cases. Many backlog numbers holidays. even ""0 death"" day.. 15.. 80.. 6... erratic hope immunity lasts lifetime :) Well shit. almost two months annoying symptoms remain. Still smell, everything tastes either like coins pure salt, keep putting food sink dishes fridge, takes extra three seconds register anything happening road toes look frostbitten.

This least respiratory respiratory illness i've ever had. I‚Äôve heard several people many things smell like chemicals Uhh wow, overwhelmingly toxic amount nationalism bigotry read comment. I'm literally speechless. It‚Äôs late Rare must pretty scary occurence recipient.

But whole scheme things, scarier hospital stay intubated guess. first detect set covid-19 genomics (COG-UK) mapped genome 150,000 samples. There‚Äôs nothing suggest originated UK. moderna arm really sore couple days, slightly elevated temp chills 36 hours lasted 12 hours. fine since. story scary new variant Denmark led culling iirc 14 million mink long UK variant announced. little testing? brain smell like? doubt. Nearly 3k deaths day absolutely tragic. Talking vaccine long term I'm fine people getting shocked new strain whether new strain. Anything gets people wear masks socially distance. 21 cases 1.8 million talk fear mongering Civilized? barbarians broken gates.  128 upvotes alphabetty spaghetti. rush school straight back well? Fucking useless nonsense. Tony Blair commenting this? I‚Äôm American don‚Äôt remember medical expertise? I‚Äôm curious role care opinion?  Nah, opium long time came along.

We favourite dealers. fact vitamin shown reduce effects covid. Vietnam gets lot sun. Yep 15% military budget would still leave $613.3 BILLION military. 

This pandemic keeps proving little care citizens. ‚Äúallergic reactions occurring rate 11.1 per 1 million vaccinations.‚Äù

‚Äúcases Dec. 14 Dec. 23, identified 21 cases anaphylaxis administration 1,893,360 doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. these, 71% occurred within first 15 minutes vaccine administration.‚Äù

So....it‚Äôs rare. Try explaining low infection rate then. 1,500 cases, imported.  Holy shit. mask wearing culture culture go work matter what, nobody stays home sick, sounds great pandemic bad beginning. Surely realize that. worst season viruses happened NZ relatively new spread enough cause harm Ok. troll, young, naive, plain dumb.

Have good one Wow fascinating, thanks. Aaaand kids go back school? Probably like yesterday? Ok days 3k instead 2k make better. Tons people dying nearly enough urgency get vaccine out. absolutely pathetic governance feds state locals governments needs improve now. think calculations flawed, though. US, deaths immediately included latest data. many cases, would take upto 3 weeks reasonably accurate count (all cause) deaths. words, 3 weeks, could expect around 90% deaths included data. caused people erroneously believe deaths US deaths previous years, illusion. among crazy america today. 4000 deaths reported.

over 500 california. waited closing borders longer USA lmfao happens whole state full? states obligation take in? realize pandemic gone year. NZ's first confirmed case Febuary 2019. went winter flu season already. November. guess mine moderate severe, able smell taste whole time. healthy, shape, underlying health issues took good six weeks feel like again. Covid sucks, man. Hopefully J&amp;J really data ready review too. wasn‚Äôt hard surely much smaller less populated islands like Iceland wouldn‚Äôt much higher death rates. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Large numbers healthcare frontline workers refusing vaccine, 20-60% depending location. That's what's screwing tiered deployment US, vaccines sitting freezer. Didn‚Äôt say soon discovered it‚Äôs probably already widespread US? minority population bringing everybody down. Don‚Äôt put us boat country could‚Äôve closed borders implemented effective contact tracing testing, yet didn‚Äôt note comparison, first state emergency declared Japan last April-ish, Japans total daily number new cases 241 (compared 6001 yesterday). Struggling see pretty clear-cut decision. Personally know two people got twice. israel 60% antivaxxers numbers would still since small fraction population innoculated. try microtarget, example, healthcare workers, set aside enough vaccines try vaccinate them, every refusal results undistributed vaccine. say everyone 70 come get vaccine, 2 million people age 800000 doses, refusals affect throughput people want vaccine gotten theirs, since ones want show get refusals stay home. notice line long open next age group. me, resident, everyone frightened make decisive action lest catch blame go perfectly. politicians happy pass buck. Tokyo Governor says ""we'll ask central government"", central government says ""we'll ask experts"", experts bootllickers say ""well, difficult say, need time."" mean time, nothing gets done situation gets worse. can't figure Germany well First wave catastrophically bad right now. 

Should think Germany, April less 1/4 cases Italy?

At time Italy Germany reported similar numbers Cases 1/3 deaths Italy.
Down thought german cousins better healthcare. 

Whatever stay strong Germany. well, least zero justification keeping current ones. might best ease somewhat gradually rather drop completely particular day. *some* clue still limited though. American pharmacist small pharmacy owner here. 

I see lot disparity people treated hospitals doctors kind payment expect receive. 

The private insurances charged high prices hospitals docs price negotiated insurance company. kicker patient pay thousands paid enough money get price break insurance. 

Those insured state (Medicaid) given substandard care doctors reimbursed poorly state. 

The uninsured? fall cracks unless cash hand doctors likely never see payment. 

It truly class warfare. 

TLDR: hospital business never sentence. American health care biased toward privileged. growth infections UK lot steeper South Africa. Considering South African variant detected August British variant dates back September, would expected opposite. 10% seem still symptoms 12 weeks later, I'm sure want avoid (Note says nothing age general health affects Archived link: downvoted oblivion. There's evidence show vaccines prevent spread entirely. slow need concrete evidence wholesale dump social distancing. give months know definitively.

That said data shows virus still spreads despite reduced levels something think r fuk

Edit: need more. Vaccines help body respond ultra fast infection point virus little opportunity multiply inside still take live virus air airways sneeze onto someone else. Hence could much smaller time smaller amount spread virus.

Likely find scenario inconsequential ever actually even occur real world. really count one insofar vaccine prevent infection--just symptoms. rate last 3 4 days already 2-3x average whole month was.

And could without including second doses. (Meaning adding second doses makes numbers higher) state CDC say data first doses.  Old news hopefully we'll get reporting it.

Biggest revelation 1. grafting spike proteins onto coronaviruses increase infectiousness absolutely within sort activity 2. specifically known method undetectable looking virus 3. Chinese US researchers collaborated closely this, right Fauci specifically supporting projects - China may one let escape together. live there, curfew four least four week. also compared Sweden Quebec pretty similar population-wise. IIRC home testing kits undergoing federal approval process would allow people gather samples themselves, conduct test home well. contrast LabCorp test kit requires mail back sample test.

&amp;#x200B;

If home test kits pass regulatory process deemed effective tests, theory federal government could commission mass production kits would allow every willing American self test home provide proof negative results weekly basis whenever exposure confirmed positive case... That's looking like likely turn events IMO, idea... store community service close. talking about. 

Natural infection killed millions, billions millennia.

Vaccines saved countless lives, I‚Äôm even going say, saved don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre safe them.

Just look Spanish Invasion Americas see happens deadly diseases ran rampant without prior exposure cure. population dropped **90%** onset Spanish arrival ensuing century.

I‚Äôm completely astounded arrived conclusion ‚ÄúVaccines better‚Äù. How? Like logistically avoid long lines total chaos?

Online registration. get confirmation, show time get jab. People allowed building appointment time. 

What difficult that? 

Of course, minority people cannot use online reservations, car drive location, bunch reasons. **minority** people. Let's save **majority** people first, worry rest later. get flu vaccine every year, we‚Äôll get year. big. elected president actively undercut CDC every step way. Florida deaths, cases per 1,000,000 residents California. Hardly surprising considering many people still support current admin despite everything going on.

It lines nicely purely anecdotal theory least third population earth much smart &amp; capable using higher brain functions high functioning toddler, mean quite literally. Lost souls unfortunate genetic byproducts yet worked messy evolutionary system. helped society coddling types elites wanting around people easily take advantage of, keep gene pool far longer be.

I‚Äôll bringing Guinness! :D Yes lack certain dna trait called wear facemasks makes receptive Covid. Apparently lack dna directly related stupidity. That's smart. unnecessarily insert apprehension peoples minds. Don‚Äôt part problem lawmakers Congress received 1st dose Pfizer vaccine, provides 50% efficacy first dose 95% second dose. Chances symptoms (if any) attenuated due vaccination. clear whether (full) vaccination reduces spread COVID-19, hence people expected still wear masks even they've vaccinated.

She probably still quarantine, CDC guidelines currently call people quarantine 7-10 days. individuals develop symptoms, need quarantine 10 days; test negative, period reduced one week. would've contagious period time symptomatic. said, member Congress received first vaccine dose subsequently tested positive.

I realize trying make sides argument, especially since using Fox News source (not exactly non-partisan), really one cases members Congress, particularly [the following CDC guidelines. I'm approaching issue angles. can‚Äôt give medical advice benefit risk ratio aspirin heavily skewed towards benefit think stupid right word, people scared moment tend defer judgement person shouting loudest biggest crowd following them. generally accepted truths come existence. 

I'm speculating moment, could wrong. findings encouraging, Ostrov cautions self-medicating antihistamines COVID-19 prevention treatment. So-called ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù use medications take place detailed consultation physician, said.

That sounds like standard boilerplate, honestly. Ditto starting new exercise routine: ""Check doctor first"" Yes, BSL3 labs can't taken vaccine production. There's lot terms logistics, legality, disrupting ongoing work. work BSL2 collaborators BSL3. can't take labs convert them. Masks protect wearer others around you. Studies late 2020 proved this.

As highly vulnerable person, I'm putting family first. Countries testing variant - ""Nope seen cases here!""

Im saying variant start UK entirely possible, EU testing laughable. number medical staff refuse take vaccine probably threw distribution plans. Pour water bottle; tussin assume carry / drive thru only, haven‚Äôt lived Colorado Springs 5 years guy idea he's talking about, unfortunately. handful documented cases reinfection probably billion infections worldwide. makes naturally acquired immunity 99.99999+% effective. 

The manufacturers claim efficacy rates 90-95%, shorter timescale. 

Also naturally acquired immunity almost always superior vaccine-conferred immunity (exceptions HPV vaccine pneumococcal vaccine). People exposed SARS-1 still circulating antibodies *17 year later*.

People already COVID sure AF de-prioritized. vaccine's wasted them. Anecdotal know two people got reinfected. Nice. get flu shot reduce chances get flu get it, less severe. government much people following given advice, I'm gonna damn well make sure I'm wearing mask myself. hospitals longer threatened. say ‚Äúmost idiotic way possible‚Äù, say ‚Äúmost profitable way possible random group Trump cronies grift national emergency pandemic‚Äù, tomayto/tomahto  talking about? would covered NHS... finished study infection rates something like 11,000 healthcare workers UK found literally zero reinfections 2nd wave.

This probably good time remind vaccines need boosters.  That's interesting. I'm interested Fauci say internal review. That's amazing news. Masks protect wearer others around you. Studies late 2020 proved this. Cell culture (in vitro) vs whole human (in vivo) two totally different things often show different responses. hail mary get start feeling ill. Angry neighbor calls lies police suspected lockdown breaker like that! Storm Walgreens, patriots!!  I‚Äôm weird position I‚Äôm hopeful optimistic coming months everyone around given hope, 6-8 months ago hopeless everybody else around seemed optimistic.

Odd dichotomy. hysteria mutations needs reigned in. Hopefully get definitive proof vaccines still work days. Natural immunity, good. infected wana take chances infection consider vaccine. Yesterday someone posted SF ok

LA sending people SF. order given literally yesterday.   appreciate response. Thanks! 


Just case anyone else comes across additional info, even mean private practices doctors offices staff, like single therapist counseling sole proprietor individual practice. So, HR speak of. Someone like would still qualify ""behavioral health provider"" least technically fit end phase 1 vaccine distribution Massachusetts, messaging state indicating actually access vaccination. lot coworkers healthcare want see people react second dose get right, there's nothing stopping making priority list anything stopping year *Operation Warp-Speed*... Nothing incompetence current administration effectively wielding power entire federal government setting simple guidelines would saved countless lives priority list effective distribution plan ready begin soon FDA gave vaccines green light. I've gotten mild case covid. 29 male. consider drinking low doses aspirin every day bit? Meant higher per million. vaccine nearly always superior 'natural' infection terms developing immunity specific pathogen without widespread inflammatory immune response develops disease.

This completely backwards, bub. Naturally acquired immunity almost always superior vaccine-conferred immunity, likely case COVID. 

After all, vaccine manufacturers claiming something like 90 95% efficacy, whereas probably billion infections worldwide handful documented reinfections.

Get it? Natural infection appears confer 99.99999+% immunity considerably longer time scale vaccine's 90-95% immunity. Thats grim office xmas friend, gonna lie. depends precautions taken religious local authorities.  Well Sweden certainly learned lot herd immunity experiment they?  facts suppressed people stupid understand them. Effects reason vaccines needed testing. They've tested enough participants approved, safety profiles good.

Also, mRNA vaccines (BioNTech Moderna) adenovirus based vaccine (Oxford) designed specifically make immune system recognize spike protein SARS-CoV-2 that, reduces chance target effects. Wasnt already overwhelmed? keep reading every week year. much in-n-out

I got Covid back march 2020 looking see anyone else sharing issues offer help me. Initially contracting disease, met moderate symptoms thankfully, worst thing come immediate loss taste smell lasted month. began regain sense, noticed everything absolutely awful taste smell something can't describe never experienced anything foul before. rotten smell taste lasted 3 weeks able start differentiating different smells tastes. able start smelling tasting things again, everything ate tasted unfamiliar well everything smelled. Food used love became far less appetizing sort candle scent enjoyed nothing like previously remember being. would wonder imagining differences truly change something odd started happen seemed prove wrong. Every weird thing would happen split second flavor would pop mouth smell nose recognize instantly, leave mouth nose noticing it. going past months every smell taste different recognize exactly immediately happens. scents flavors would experience covid would instantly disappear return currently expecting taste smell like. know going crazy real issue would appreciate help info could happening anyone else experiencing I, well family, think losing lmao. double people died 9/11 attacks died everyday US long covid part probably wouldn‚Äôt surprising explains well, also vaccines pretty sweet huh? guy vaccines approves vaccine I'm taking it. Russian vaccine. Russia China serious countries. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll two hot dogs side Moderna.‚Äù People lost confidence government. serious measures taken months despite steady increase daily cases, instead government consistently applied measures arguably make situation worse (like semi-lockdown weekends past 1PM, means people gather 1PM curfews). 

If government care, populace? find 3 months it‚Äôs both. quote it. FL republican governor morons sub jerk negative press dig him.

Ask NY numbers yesterday they‚Äôll come sort deflection. almost many positives FL despite smaller population. Proof robust protection? real. tf people get vocal staying indoors much?! much depends rest operation. mine probably cost $30/kg, Molycorp became bloated wanted high overhead Denver tech company instead lean mining organization. could fire sale kept operations open new owner squeak bit profit, screwed bankruptcy.

I haven‚Äôt followed situation last years general good non-Chinese rare earth operators handle complexities minor metal. Still, McDonald‚Äôs fries better. I‚Äôm convinced double frying necessary best fries.

In n fried potatoes freshly cut. Prioritize get vaccines arms. Sheesh. shame even taken thought... 24/7 vaccinations. 3am appointments. Pull stops. Fun fact: Spanish flu started america.  get sometimes, honestly, make go holy shit bad average. Nothing write home about.

Only reopen Arbys Bay Area. Fever medication definitely does. Okay ... serious question (and apologies coming layman):

We know viruses, like Chicken Pox, Herpes, stick around systems infection ""re-emerge"" (as shingles herpetic outbreak).

Is possible reinfections COVID equivalent herpes outbreak actually reinfection? Can't wait become aligator.  

Finally good news coming country! live country offers pfizer Sinopharm ( Chinese vaccine) one go for?? US rush get vaccinated would scored 50 million shots going say brainer rename IIRC Scott Peterson murder case. think logistical advantage, I'd like know receive much vaccine per capita. Go county's health department website, information available. When's soonest vaccines could predicted distributed masses CA? shit ton? We've vaccine deliveries per pizza box Romania, works, works (this southeastern Europe all) Silver lining missing birthdays may unlocked key immortality. Well that's reason though. Hospitals ICUs overwhelmed around country, average age ICU admission around 60 years old, potentially 20+ years live. Well sites depends # personal available got Moderna vaccine 5 hours ago. I‚Äôve dreaming day long.... wouldn‚Äôt laughed you, mean...an adverse reaction vaccine that‚Äôs bad enough knock work entire day would be...really, really unusual. Moderna vaccine stored regular refrigerator 30 days. Literally COVID vaccine requires ultra cold storage Pfizer/Biontech vaccine. That‚Äôs it.

In terms cost, you‚Äôre definitely right. long run mRNA vaccines actually easier produce viral vector vaccines mRNA don‚Äôt need culture grow live virus. production ramps mRNA vaccines likely become cheaper. Unfortunately Florida huge state. basically every day least one county/hospital opening appointments. booking next week missed say today's, would available next Thursday. would highly encourage check county live in/nearby available appointments help book. 

Most needed basic information name, date birth, phone, email. asked address all. 

My mom got her's Broward week waited car line standing issue, similar system may work grandfather. also portable toilets available location. Would like shot mustard relish? Onions?

Sorry, none ketchup. Japan one largest elderly demographics world, maybe government trying fix balance sheets. Actually opposite, they've trying catch closures months they've short staffed times, schedules packed.  vaccine pace get better &amp; better. holidays over. Unfortunately unit it‚Äôs 100% due antivaxx logic. work neuroscience unit. It‚Äôs truly unfortunate. Highly doubt this, especially pace going administering vaccines. Sweden badly, things considered. actually looked numbers yourself? mean cases, deaths well.

Another point: asked magically isolate ourselves? Even young healthy little risk? Less deadly I'm referring to, infectuous. think people would happy became infectious less lethal, grand scheme things lethal could become less lethal third dealing something less serious flu. change though? add third mask top two, TF2 style?

What need day day hasn‚Äôt changed since march. good constant panic do? We'll take good news get Yes fckd second wave Someone put way me, don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs perfect analogy helped explain:

Getting virus like house broken into, get glimpse run door. give rough description tell neighbors lock doors, that‚Äôs it.

A vaccine like putting wanted posters criminal town, even break houses, anyone sees call cops right away. Right. dangerous. won‚Äôt like ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal Tuesday‚Äù, gradually going back normal time. Another church that's covid super spreader.

What surprise.... /s White House shut point.

I feel like finally vaccine, we're waiting intelligent responsible people government, who'll finally functioning plan. Thats point around short period time everything basically baseless assumptions guesses point, includes covid itself, vaccine safety, long lasts, everything. assume not. live (and administration) proven interest data transparency, put mildly. best wants confuse issue, worst try change data. Either way, make decisions state official says Florida. He's mini-Trump unfortunately appeals majority people here.  Yeah, friend living planned community Disney. Celebration it? guess got hit pretty hard. large 70+ population. second this.

We saw coming months ago.

The hard part seeing happen real life moment.

This 7 Kingdoms though... here, winter 3 months. possible right thing *not* constant panic attack? paralyzed fear remember mask? give vaccine already positive Covid. would pointless, therapeutic. Fuck off. abortion we're talking about. arm ready, shoot nice vaccine dude do. dude know he's talking about. fans establishment would gladly stay line hours. ‚ÄúHold beer‚Äù - California I'm really surprised Japanese government want start using vaccine March. agree it‚Äôs embarrassing California think dumpster fire misinformation Facebook is, reddit holding general info corona vaccine higher standard.

The spike protein different coronaviruses undergo mutation makes different enough escape obtained immunity. typically slow process though. Drive through? maybe one people outside taking orders long line?

My guess, enough CO residents wear masks. takes one mistake adjust mask absorb droplet. Don‚Äôt forget mile long receipt ! Yeah time spring summer. Love it. Thanks good vibes  Okay. what's point? make everyone's lives harder including own? what? thinking things through? Well theyre calling SUPER COVID! agree. However based we've seen far, take clusterfuck different approaches single horribly broken approach. naturally get overshadowed due events DC, still horrifying see grim predictions come realization, seemingly world caring first world countries (Western Europe, England-offshoot nations, Tier 1 Asian states) able afford

Brazil, Argentina Mexico vaccinate produce AstraZeneca vaccine. Chile, Mexico Costa Rica already vaccinating population Pfizer one. agree 100%. also take time people adjust new recommendations, especially wearing mask foreign vast majority. That's yet another reason recommendations come lot earlier, like Norway Denmark example. That's something happens vaccines, like, there's one example happening, exceedingly rare, doubt statistically significant. Due possibility, intense testing vaccines lasts really long time, abundance caution. case current Covid vaccines, vaccine gone body days, maybe week. can't anything that. spinking Europe restrictions, especially Eastern Europe earlier lockdowns less heavy first wave. sure sounds like tested know many get antibodies huh? Eventually be, cost far higher necessary. bad idea. create brackets distribution many people within brackets saying (and prolonging agony)? Make available whoever wants it, now, = herd immunity achieved quicker. [An article linked says LTCs opt local pharmacy it. brother's ICU (he's nurse) Brevard really ever busy, thankfully.  lot seems depend area in.

There's beach east coast I've ever (in like 500 visits, grew there) need within 50 feet someone. exceptions Piers holidays, simple solution hike beach ways boardwalk far anyone. wife got vaccinated local hospital, said bunch people line, ton doses, one nurse administering them.

Mitt Romney great plan mobilizing bunch retired nurses/doctors/veterinarians etc administer doses, I‚Äôm really hoping Biden admin implements something like speed things up. could worked since 14 (or whatever working age is). Point headline could simply read:

""Funeral Home Director Overwhelmed""

Instead see sensationalized headline referring ""Death Calls"" typical calls funeral director receives every day, day. 

It's bullshit headline designed play emotions clearly, time comment reply, 42 people triggered calling demonstrated beautiful downvotes. there's nothing stopping making priority list. two things simultaneously. many healthcare workers denying vaccine. wasting time. need shots arms. seems way... Tip use Flonase really change azelastane allergies way better... Shout everyone got allergy testing nurse said ""Oh god!!!!"" FDA Fauci said misinterpreting data. i.e. Quacks work large medical system, frontline clinical, WFH. decided try get vaccine anyway, I'm grocery runner house, exposure risk, heard vaccination place busy plenty stock, they've trying get everyone eligible go, attendance pretty low. 

So walked right vaccination place, nothing checked, place nearly empty, lines anything. front desk nurse there. Fill basic information form, got 1st shot vaccine. NOTHING checked, work badge, department, nothing. anyone knew go, would've able get vaccinated.

I thought pretty interesting. side effects starts showing year? wife notice everytime go pharmacy, pharmacist looks like miserable, stressed human ever. case?

Seems like rough job best occasions...

Also, getting paid extra work? yet information Bay Area Stay Home order [which set expire Puzzling. wonder long take stop holding breath pass people hallway Unless death figures badly underestimated outbreak isn‚Äôt advanced enough (yet, time action) virus show overall palliative care death numbers country 126 million people. noted re-infection possible still rare. re-infection serious also rare. also takes extensive testing determine re-infection long haul effects.

That's say act like 100% immune probably worth losing sleep over. Alarmism even working. suggest bricks thrown windows news Yes less places enacting restrictions early enough good compliance people.  Romney's face looked like skin irritation nose, lines face mask wearing.. doesent follow. Rooting Americans fun. try know might seem rough now, still every bit faith really starts slow March becomes barely relevant summer. winter months always supposed suck. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., said intends to¬†vote the¬†House¬†floor Sunday, despite announcing six days ago tested¬†positive for¬†coronavirus. Somewhere range. heard low 60%, high 90%. really, cases spiking northern hemisphere regardless restrictions implemented. Israel, UAE, Bahrain, UK currently better US distributing vaccine. fucking matter. 

The goal distribution system keep available supply that. achieving goal aka failing. right ,send way don‚Äôt mind getting never mRNA vaccines before. work second stage / booster shot? get ""extra"" shot would expired, provider give priority next shot 3 weeks guess? COVID motto: infect one, infect awesome, downright creepy.

Georgia anything like Florida there‚Äôs measures DeSantis said they‚Äôre allowed enforce anything. thing done stuff companies like requiring masks go inside. know kind database people want vaccine register scheduled receive it. could manage make Google Form collect interested people's addresses family Christmas cards, someone important vaccination campaign we've seen past 50 years Damn fuck lives Bible education need!


/s I‚Äôve heard same, makes sense. Worse first description. We're talking 7 months inbetween infections, really doubt first infection carried long, especially since get cleared return work (ie can't symptomatic, contagious) last 6 months leading this. get vaccine I‚Äôll take antibody test. It‚Äôs 6 months. It‚Äôll 8 get vaccine. 

I‚Äôm basically used find antibody status rate something. 

So I‚Äôm data point research Yup. business totally trashed. Oh well. Better getting covid. saying likely made worse fact shelter place, putting closer quarters moving quickly together one place another well increasing amount time together. hope better.

Look. want wrong. want work. eat crow apologize happily it.

I‚Äôm hesitant trust anyone shitshow. poor person, that's two weeks' worth groceries.   Reps refused wear masks sheltering smh Mind asking serious second case was? I‚Äôve seen peers test positive twice told second time ‚Äúleft over‚Äù last time weren‚Äôt actually contagious haven‚Äôt mutated far enough away original virus evade vaccines.

People really need understand point. logical comparison influenza virus, one actually mutate degree vaccine needs adapted. Coronavirus known decades behave way, exactly panic new strains largely unfounded fear mongering. Even without antibodies, could potentially protected decades. People got SARS-CoV-1 still showing protection virus 17 years later form earlier coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 indicated cellular immunity detectable years contracted hospitals around also aren‚Äôt allowed get them. Even work inside hospital every day hospitals vaccinating employees work home... Moderna Pfizer vaccine approved US approved short time Europe several countries. 

Why would care Trump getting reelected? hard box people check make appointment asking occupation is.

Is MGH (ranked one top 3 hospitals US) absolutely chaotic roll-out vaccines hospital, ""Free-for-all"" among nurses, doctors, staff?

&amp;#x200B;

They verify appointment times, even ask first-hand experience patients. free-for-all based ""HONOR CODE""

[**‚ÄòIt free all‚Äô: Nurse Mass General Brigham blasts system‚Äôs vaccine people actually take care COVID patients ones able sign appointments, free-for-all everyone,‚Äù said.¬†  Paul Biddinger, medical director emergency preparedness Mass General Brigham, [told Monday **the honor code** needed **hospital system, 80,000 employees,** acknowledged challenges arisen rollout.

They rely honor code 80,000 employees. Thankfully, Tally Bill got signed couple days ago little less criminal.

I'm fortunate enough position drive past VA way private providers actually held standards, several million us luxury absolutely fucking maddening. know providing counter point CA even worse that's stance (we're talking vaccine gets full approval, EUA) consequences. Kids allowed public schools without vaccines legitimate medical reason them. sporting events concerts without them. visiting patients hospitals nursing homes except dire circumstances full PPE. air travel business pleasure.

If choose receive vaccines putting can't actually get effective risk. public health threat treated like one. feel like, like stuff, mistake go one strategy. I'm sure went age based, we'd missing big reduction potential numbers deaths dire hospitalizations vaccinating front line workers (both medic la, generally vaccinating would help cut chaos/anxiety). time... Since said vaccines present transmission... really see point trickling career based model way essential workers. True, would reduce number cases risk, rescue number virus cases help cause essential workers less likely dire need hospitalization develop severe systems

I would say priority probably go: Medical frontline workers help reduce chaos pandemic caused could readily report, start going age fore highest risk age group, go professions and..

Wait. starting sound awful lot like current vaccine plan, includes 70 risk age wise incredibly early plan understand reasoning. another important aspect vaccine perhaps important one fact need vaccinate majority people achieve herd immunity get back normal life.

A lot people suffering losing jobs, businesses socially isolated. problems solved safely open society again. I'm sure believe ok, whatever. comment reads like trying bait people. good day believe read hold enough people virus sample test on, Covid, plenty people willing test since numbers control since start. 

Either way, vaccine tested certified several international independent health agencies cleared safety. better getting covid without it. false positive rate ‚Äî is, often test says virus actually ‚Äî close zero. false-positive results thought due lab contamination problems lab performed test, limitations test Masks work social distancing. think contest? keep seeing people talk second dose SARA vaccine killed people. anyone good source this? Gilbert

My mother, 76 years old, told wishes dad would get die already. He‚Äôs 80 high risk. asked bothered get tested wife exposed work.

Mormon, trumpster deniers responsible this.  mean don‚Äôt need 70% immunity vaccines expiring can't find someone give timely manner, better? Letting vaccine expire giving anyone wants it? Agreed. rules implemented restraint become viewed unreasonable treated such. flatten curve rewarded nothing return fuck em, indefinitely extended rules clearly ever going repealed resistance, reason. I'm sure transport company rules passengers. Like reasonable sober, wear mask, follow instructions driver/pilot. entering plane, boat bus give liberties safety onboard. google it.

omg, must hurt. I‚Äôve seen WestJet ads targeted BC Alberta residents saying show negative corona test don‚Äôt isolate Hawaii.

It‚Äôs infuriating. sound like family nineteen, may youngest funeral home manager Texas (not including kids help parents‚Äô business). knew passion time ten years old. still remember moment decided career. teenage cousin lost long battle cancer went viewing stunned. lying casket wearing prom dress. hair perfect, makeup exquisite. first time viewing body, still remember much meant family.  Probably also little fact becoming Nurse difficult require lot science education. Know someone high school RN barely could understand chemistry biology. Colleges act like ""competitive"" get nursing programs reality, long meet minimum requirements, probably getting in. Bachelor's degrees general watered college education starting mean less less. Outside specialty, need bright. But, holds true lot occupations. know, claim fact.

And I've never disputed neighbours' numbers. They've great response seen good success. Credit due. NJ that. http://covidvaccine.nj.gov

You sign contact you‚Äôre eligible. Outside couple \*live vaccines\* \*very rarely\* infect immuno-compromised patients underlying virus (AKA virus remains dormant patient's system extended period time making sick), vaccines cause latent side-effects observed years vaccination?

The vast majority side effects occur observed short-term, even go long term effects. ""Latent"" side effects (i.e. arising 5, 10, 15 years later) pretty much myth. want know grinds gears? keep calling variants STRAINS. They. Are. NOT. Fucking. STRAINS! supply outstripping demand due people refusing, makes sense distribute others. Or, production faster distribution, could two lines: one priority patients one everyone assumption keep first line supplied time takes distribute.

Ultimately, best protection nursing home residents vaccinating many people possible. it? company bought $6,000 gaming computer best lead time 3090. Last time checked hospitals empty Fair enough. Get GPU's now! Masks rule guideline. 9 months mandatory masks I've seen grand total 2 people wearing mask store required. might actually get herd immunity vaccine rate contaminate oxygen oil. 
Which cause chemical pneumonia. 
Which oxygen transported liquid evaporated pressure.
Which already know, tell this? correct far individual concerned, impetus burden them. point making logistical standpoint, much easier lock five cities opposed five hundred, therefore works Australia can't necessarily scaled automatically assumed work US. Haha. call game ‚ÄúSo naturally, assumed dying.‚Äù people don‚Äôt follow restrictions understand won‚Äôt work right? Shocker We'll reup vaccine disease extinct. virus high profile hundred years. mild flu you. Cry more.

This shit kills old people ravages nursing homes. Get vaccines elderly. Fuck everyone else, fuck healthcare workers. Based 55,728 PCR tests conducted nationwide. Yeah. agree say. Although think would world war 4, honestly.

World war 3 rare earths (the elements used make computers). Luckily great orange power won‚Äôt though. Immunology PhD here. agree overall sentiment, Moderna Pfizer likely remain effective, exactly right. spike protein mutate many places (""residues""), vaccine likely still effective. However, definitely mutations that, occur, would result decreased effectiveness. There's perfect way telling mutations would be, designing vaccine tried think create best targets. However, there's thing perfect intuition, say sure unless direct evidence. testing basically? Except testing even anything except confirm obvious? think people assume nurses necessarily, default, indepth knowledge biology science behind it.

Which many, many _doctors_ don't, nursing schools/colleges focus far less area too. So...yeah. unfortunate. Thank nice words, tough getting support. know sound selfish comment apologize that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* studies show Tuskegee impact black people‚Äôs willingness sign medical I‚Äôm vaccines I‚Äôm even going argue said. everyone else gets vaccine great! hope do. get one myself. That‚Äôs last I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm going argue vaccines COVID-19 general.

Edit: argument mixing flu shot. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good idea. luckily I‚Äôm one making call anyway. different drugs briefly mention Famotidine (Pepcid ac) also studied. explain higher death rate rest canada heavier restrictions? man photo gloves on?! start must speed up. need vaccinate everyone 65yr end February. current rate spending 2021 lock down. cannot allowed happen. 2000s, increase slowed suddenly rise years 2018 2019, much result mild flu season required lives fewer elderly people. 



And 2020, ""savings"" 2018 2019 became due. shows fairly clearly annual graph. sorry loss. One almost 4000 people day dying America due virus mitigated simple things group can't follow. Mask up, stay home, stay distanced wash hands.  vaccine magic pill get rid country wide. best hope protect it. 

here info quickly developed working existing knowledge world wide collaboration.  

Now get past hurdle, lets focus environment 1 planet currently live on. WW3 drinking water something. someone worked government works private sector, never trust government anything time sensitive. hired logistics consultants push vaccine plans quickly possible. done guarantee wouldn‚Äôt today. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* real cases probably 4-5 times reported, many asymptotic. Tbh, people going rn high risk zones won‚Äôt take vaccine anyways. Probably won‚Äôt need 2/3 population reach herd immunity. MRNA vaccines used several animal vaccines since 1990. new humans. reason question safety. Statistically, almost one foundation vaccine develop trial data. shouldn‚Äôt let nurses hook. surrounded medicine every day. know medicine works. 

Agreed second point. uncle doctor moron comes many things outside specialty. Arizona resident here. governor head state health department, Cara Christ. Hell, [200 doctors called resign August following are. coworker coma vent back March, luckily survived. tested positive antibodies June, another positive antibody test 2 weeks ago. Ffs. fucking VARIANT. Woman refusing pregnant breastfeeding. Black people refusing history BIPOC used unwitting lab rats country. Conservatives refusing Bill Gates trying kill and/or track them. perspective. saw interview Butant√£ director vaccine chinese Chinese. Since developed Brazilian side. indeed, ""owned"" Chinese. Brazilian scientists massive roll development process. Fun fact: [2015 Gallup found 2/3rds Israelis identify secular atheist, ranks among world's least religious countries. I‚Äôm sure sucks hope recover quickly, attempting find bright side, chance eat spiciest foods ever get destroyed!

You bragging rights eating, say, ghost pepper chili Carolina reaper chips! trying honest. KNOW others don‚Äôt trust science. thought pretty clear. stick head sand pretend people universally accept vaccine that‚Äôs ignorant. caused flu shots go world would good idea? You‚Äôre acting like post said ‚ÄúVACCINES DEBIL!‚Äù mind boggling.. saw one location using eventbrite SMART. Don‚Äôt reinvent wheel. That's quite **so** suprising. There's reports hospitals state giving doctors seniority admin staff ignoring nurses, residents janitors working COVID wards first. cases shut don‚Äôt know, vaccine trials test people trial covid unless presented symptoms. Yes guess clinical trial results allow become part standard care protocol actually 100% mild severe 0 hospitalization. 78% efficacy showing symptoms. 

Video presentation slide Butantan institute Brazil 3 min shows 100% reduction above. researched today, Brazilian manufacturer able output 40 million doses month currently, Sinovac China produce 600 million year. great news around.

The approved vaccines, faster get this. Well baseless data suggest this. guarantee last years, showing promise.

Not sure hating this. Eh, what's worst happen. Yay!!! Congrats! Oh get in? wonder. Based mortality, particularly younger (under 50) people seeing 6x many excess deaths compared confirmed COVID deaths. got first dose moderna today, amazing news !!! Kind way late crumb better nothing ""most vulnerable"" mostly thinking elderly immunocompromised. Obesity smoking increase risk little bit nearly extent old age.  proof virus spreading, way protect vulnerable. vaccines lockdowns. Media public opinion people **not** states too.

I feel like politicians want look ""good"" world stage, even constituents screaming something different. Like political one-upmanship see toughest covid. cases deaths unnaceptable.  believe they're testing corpses. Running low supplies. end eventually, right? vaccine provide 100% protection extremely unlikely virus eliminated globally, rather become seasonal annoyance like flu / cold. Australia can't keep cut world indefinitely, open cases (just lot fewer lot mild cases currently). Yeah, shot hang 15 assure reaction. Shit get ready COVID-19 MK.II. China‚Äôs Reddit farms hard work downvoting thread bills horrifying. Also hospitals actually ever expect someone pay kind bill? Seems like bill inflation make seem cheaper pay 1/10th later."
