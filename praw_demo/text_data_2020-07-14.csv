 seemingly reasonable argument neglects fact Trump administration trying downplay virus beginning, suppressed numbers clearly play Trump's favour coming election. 

Your assumption decision timing apolitical seems naive best. decision made political vacuum. Trumpty Dumpty nutshell right Nobody gonna mention guy's last name Redfield? Ok Stop answering phone. may totally wrong, might saying originally (back February/March) CDC saying wear masks, help. Personally, suspicions knew masks would help, (probably rightfully) concerned masks would hoarded healthcare workers would screwed. 

I thought nuts saying masks help bought several reusable cloth ones right away. Trump devastating country.

- Captain Obvious Lmfao.

This guy delusional. Anyone thinks piece cloth going stop spread virus delusional.

The way stop spreading is

A. Develop EFFECTIVE vaccine.


B. Never anyone EVER leave house. Ever.


Good luck B. hope government plenty handouts ready.

Really people, coronavirus. Never history mankind squelched similar virus ""wearing masks"". Either runs population, vaccine developed soon enough. Breaking news Election close call use Audacious winamp skin take seriously, see madness, I‚Äôm trying think lives get back normal scientifically. Even vaccine comes out, doubt lot mask deniers even take thus keeping going much longer. society survived plague, hope evolution job point little faith human interference fixing point Well there's decent chance virus 2023. mean there's good chance we'll vaccine atleast form treatment then. Pandemics last forever Yes. reverse would stupid people stupid know stupid. Dunning-Kruger effect. There‚Äôs good portion people (you know portion mean) seem death wish point. Won‚Äôt require masks. Won‚Äôt distance. Go message boards like Marketwatch say something vaccines, attitude basically ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt safe, if‚Äôs safe won‚Äôt work, works won‚Äôt effective long.‚Äù It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt even want one. aren‚Äôt happy solution doesn‚Äôt involve Great Darwinian Die-Off. It‚Äôs like want see two million Americans die say right, inevitable. Keep politics this! creepy head necessary better mannequin head? Seems like went way make look strange (probably generate clicks) They've pivoted talking points. went blaming China unleashing deadly virus us, pretending big deal. Apparently think theit supporters smart enough see that's inconsistent, short enough memory realize they've completely switched narratives. F#*k!?!?!!! Unfortunately scientists develop ones making $5bn. done deal, widespread impossible stop. that's left hope building economy back children. can't afford live America. What‚Äôs wrong old people tested positive New York sent back nursing homes infect people. least side effects patients. doses. 

Which means it‚Äôs going fail 30,000 person trial. 

What need look trial 45 people side effects. 

Because get 30,000, start deal half percent. 1%. like 4-8 years. pandemic. I‚Äôm genius. every act makes seems completely intended hurt Americans, really answer. still mask can. First, distance covid travel dynamic situation dependent; humidity, wind conditions, force someone talking, coughing, sneezing. Distance? much? Answer one knows. 

Secondly, may try keep distance, cannot account people's actions. Someone way across area could come near behind sneeze face right turn around see crowding you. 

Seriously, around anyone whose actions last 2 weeks cannot fully account safe, wear mask possible. they. I'm fucking afraid live selfish country. wife go work every day know idiot gonna give even though hardly go otherwise unless necessary mask. good folks gonna lose bad folks dunces. stock market true reflection economic health country. no, must seen articles stating BLM protest contributed 0 spread MUH rights CDC isnt getting data is? Jesus worth life? tumor. Arizona ranks bottom 5 education, would expect happily ignorant population ?  use **misleading** **context free** facts way complete moron would think accurate.

Deaths lagging indicator, cases rise, expect death rate decline deaths go slowly cases do, declining death rate along growing case numbers way mitigating fact. someone get basics would think so.

Similarly, arguing death rate low long ignore people death rate higher for(like people preexisting conditions 60) disingenuous best.

edited fix weird phrasing Yeah, we'd normally drink more, bathroom issue well staying rational enough make dumb mistake like hugging someone. Yup it‚Äôs definitely concern. Also moderna never made vaccine, way making one pretty new. said, doubt people getting vaccine thoroughly reviewed. it‚Äôs good news 45 people saw antibodies.  Leftist math insane. Also fact need resort personal attacks ends viability had.

History remember 2020 death Left. country seen react. smelled dead rat alone horrific. larger mammal fuuuuuckkked New York basically every developed country world... Best even open. everyone mean every last one it

well going happen. Let tell why:

I dear friend near Austin teaches 2nd grade. 18 years teaching experience, puts 9 years leave full pension. She'd even young enough take new career; thinks may like software coding.

She would never join strike. invested much time shoulder risks. close getting pension, close enough take early retirement &amp; hope best. completely understand position, blame one bit, far teacher school, much less district, much less statewide, position.

In terms pandemic may quit current job, stay home next year home-school daughter who's 9. husband makes enough money year without going broke. 

They handle tough year; indeed, know will. cannot handle forfeiting career pension. Yes, agree :) Huh, democratic. extrovert, small group close friends. usually spend quite bit time together. families close, take trips together celebrate important milestones. people. However, throughout this, we've maintained distance, zoomed game nights, video chatted, left surprises other's door steps. painful, love respect understand what's necessary right now. infuriating see many people care people actually sacrificing time precious people trying slow spread. Miracle vaccine way delivered Amazon drone autonomous vehicle. They'll know find us AI machine learning Somebody needs ask CDC lied us masks February could‚Äôve nipped thing bud started. Remember 15 days stop spread? Absolutely insane got zero media attention. Sounds like 25,000 tomorrow. Yeah seems big cultural factor Italy Spain hit hard, combine population density regions contributed heavily saw there. solution class unity getting vultures politics

Yikes we're trouble MMR/ MMRV, DTAP

&amp;#x200B;

He's antivaxer, people. He's playing dumb card. he's really dumb. reason NRA consistently lobbied curtail gun death data collection. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, NIH branch conducted trial. ‚ÄúThe data really look quite good,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúThere serious adverse events. 
So no, see side effects. think 4-8 weeks bit optimistic.... I'm happy county Texas made masks required!! People seem problem complying Walmart even disposable masks people come without one. Please guys. I‚Äôm watching local business drop like flies. Family members shop month masks reporting positive results. Pls üò∑ Last week's Tuesday included carryover Friday since July 4 ""weekend"" day. really appreciate sharing names. books add reading list. worth, agree last perspective presented. People well prior pandemic. situation exasperated issues we've avoiding country long. truly hope leads positive change legislative level. current system sustainable. Elon Musk basically showed big empty suit coward Newsom really is. response called logical positivism, stance something proven true false, untrue, non-existent. never want make progress whatsoever, logical positivism excellent way that. one time scientific proof hand-washing useless regard health patients. nation crisis could solved months inconvenience. people feel promised real apocalypse, cannibalism guns water shortages bomb shelters insane cars. god, they're going proper apocalypse, one way another! better exaggerating Well masks mandatory Ontario Quebec.... So... Looks like picked wrong week stop sniffing glue! anyone comment post links saved competent studies efficacy face masks &amp; social distancing regards Coronavirus? anti-vax chiropractor want date direct study. Thank you. pretty solid mask compliance north east. Dead dawn...

&amp;#x200B;

DEAD DAWN!!!! Situation province infuriating. We're almost phase 5, restaurants open, go walk every day, meet families weekends, people started stupid things like going parties, drink mate people, play soccer.. multiple outbreaks. 

And read reddit twitter see lot people crying ""the longest lockdown, buu"" (false), opposition demonstrations talking freedom.. damn, frustrating. 

It's impossible here. We're poor country people demanding first world solutions, instead fucking thing do, fucking asshole. feel trapped damn country, wish could escape partisan idiocy. underestimate billionaires desire make billions think. Also- thinks Dow economic number matters.

And still highly annoyed can't *order* go up. wanna trade citizenships Yo last season Birx held chart detailing testing machines locations like 30k cases per day. think trying insinuate capacity even close maximum states didn‚Äôt know operate machines. Anyone remember % at? Maybe like ~35-40%? party fiscal responsibility everyone!

Though deficit coronavirus? Covid way past 116k. like 150k+ theyre covering deaths like motherfucker clearly lately live new USSR apparently circumstances, nope. (Not bathroom reasons, also drinking make us likely hug someone make dumb decisions.) Normally, though... D614G present Beijing outbreak earlier.

I'm sure Harbin one though. Apparently genome data available, heard conclusions it. news? mean, new announcement, hell world Best Buy living in?!?! small early collection case studies scientific literature this, though balance would agree anything conclusive yet. study example France

 

is one peer-reviewed studies looking reinfection, still know yet relapse situation yet (though would raise set concerns). way early tell this. Russia grow lot fruits shipping pole practical. Fauci getting backed Harvard Doctor... T-man getting backed Larry Kudlow.

Sounds like toss /s Oh wow Nah. They'll bring replacements, can't afford lose TV money. Yeah. wish case. way world works there's lot 60 plus work force. Noone afford work right still job. I'm turning 60 year also manage construction projects Navy. Right work home damn fortunate. Despite advanced age still many people would'nt paying bills approving invoices. first world country healthy life expectancy one highest. means people stay workforce old shit. Like lol. seriously doubt anti-science anti-mask people even high school education. even get ""office"" job?

Um, anti-vaxx beliefs *more* prevalent among college educated people. know weird idea bachelor's education worth damn thing makes someone smarter. bachelor's degrees awarded subjects require critical thinking, intelligence, hard work. They're meaningless. northern hemisphere unlikely influenza, southern hemisphere possible well number infectious non-infectious causes could cause kind symptoms. reasonable get tested coronavirus call doctor advice. People don‚Äôt wear masks deserve get Disregards Intelligence community subject foreign policy. disregards doctors scientists (hopefully) lifetime pandemic emergency.   
   
Republicans clear present danger United States, treated such. Damn, fucked. Yeah. NY 408k cases vs CA‚Äôs 341k, many NY earlier CA. NY deaths 40k CA‚Äôs 7k. Maybe CA‚Äôs death rate continue low much learned treatment last months? hope so...  ""judge"" equivalent context then? That‚Äôs weird. live one conservative parts state would say 90% wearing masks grocery store. Like near 100%. 

A notable exception mom child wearing ‚ÄúBabies Lives Matter,‚Äù InfoWars shirt. mask child. anyone proudly displaying love infowars, well... Good luck telling ""Face masks make breathe CO2 toxic‚Äú crowd get vaccinated. happens. welcome. Id agree looking back it, pretty much wrong that, asymptomatic spread well know (at least according Snopes). However, like he's sticking original statements, unlike many others are. Either way, important prevent future deaths, knowing know don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs election now, he‚Äôs psycho doesn‚Äôt want blamed 100,000s deaths, cares rather means admitting wrong. illusion freedom. That‚Äôs quote doctor executive vice chancellor health affairs UT system. sure anything popularity contest. course don‚Äôt educate quote. I‚Äôve said before: Mask casket like, around 20% so, least that's estimate pic looks awful. Lung cancer taken toll him, soon ‚Äòrona well careless wants audience be!

Edit: never past would‚Äôve also thought slimmer Rush Limbaugh would less healthier person 10 years ago really think people wearing masks??? 

Once states hit levels NYC did, they‚Äôll also similar drop. There‚Äôs many people vulnerable virus - they‚Äôre gone, it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôll stick MLK Gandhi approach Bummer Mummers. done tho. don‚Äôt time handjobs right now. gotta go fix coronavirus expose them, quit well being, start gofundme &amp; hope goes viral (no pun intended) retire.

Just kidding...(kinda)... can't think reason legal. 

It's abuse power, guess. reason vote president next election, sure. Donald Trump told inject bleach

Did run too? Lot pent frustration right there. inside screen poor representation real thing.

Being social isn‚Äôt laser focus person. Sights, smells, going next, wanna go, walking, driving, sitting, playing games, sports.

We‚Äôre digital social animals. hate sum person, outburst tells digital socializing shadow real thing. It‚Äôs disconnection physical reality. eventually start believe severe introversion ok, digitally shame strangers they‚Äôre wrong opinion subject. Protests might caused slightly cases, that's drop bucket compared beaches bars Texas Florida!

Speaking which, better head Disney World! /s Won‚Äôt take advice someone can‚Äôt get beard control KEKW Wait, mean tell may corru
*Thud

Carry on, nothing see here. necessarily true, immunologist project team discussing issue would depend lot unknowns ex. long antibodies last (potential reinfection would blocked month two immunity period high). Also areas hardest hit initial coronavirus infection waves tended clamp hard, sharply reduced pool circulating coronavirus ex. NYC thus reduces (random) probability someone infected in, say, March would reinfected again. Plus there's issue unreliable testing early on. example French study indicating apparent reinfection among 11 people, yet conclusive enough data circumstances whether infection cleared interim period

 

 correct answer surrounding early know anything reinfection yet one way another, likely anything like solid data Fall earliest. lead example.

Our leader listened educated medical field.

We looked people first, bailouts companies without 'proof' hurting financially.

&amp;#x200B;

All look leaders fail you.

Do common sense shit, even inconvenient...and hell opinions lemmings among you. Walmart got security guard making people wear mask wearing mask ordered Texas government Yes meant at-will, brain fart wrote that, thanks. great example discussions country become polarized like politics.

There's one ""right"" ""wrong"" here, fact there's range positions two.

Oh, I'm accepting anything. Like said believe uncorroborated source. Indeed history sort out. facetiously forecasting near future given circumstance. Check paper though. worst highest doses, second shot. They're still working dosage w/e parameters need taken account - phase 1.

It's great news honestly. two phases go... American, embarrassed country's response. Sure, lot goes bad leadership millions flouting rules recommendations everywhere here. imagine real uncomfortable. want future millions free money they'll comply. Welp. Guess won‚Äôt get control then. think one first groups get vaccinated college students. 

They going irresponsible assholes regardless, absolutely going ones spread like wildfire. 

If get people vaccinated quickly could save lives. So, context

Trying avoid runs masks health care shortages (Canada exact thing Dr Tam said it).

We dont need Joe Public box 50 medical grade n95 masks garage

And specifically mention good idea infected people wear mask prevent others US count third world country now? Trumps plan along?!? sarcastic way seriously. USA needs world's help right now. wonder world willing help... always say that. sent links info. 

Also, scientist: "" studies, however, provide valid comparison rate fever among unvaccinated children similar age determine ‚Äúbackground rate‚Äù elevated temperature populations. ""

You can't compare background rate comparable study, plainly reported percentage only. Edit, dumb brain: **your article problem can't accredit reference rate standard fever age group/time frame.**

You take horse drink can't hold head underwater long enough. read want, get that. who's troll now? cherry picker can't google?

Go away, antivaxer ""No matter slice this, good news."" - Fauci agree. reason CDC sidelined started pushing back trump's lies, fauci (though ALSO so). think people saying Disney still plowed ahead, even though Florida 10k cases day. definitely regional thing. 

PA 328 cases yesterday, Florida 12,000. 

In places people wearing masks, COVID infection rate growing control. graph shows older people testing positive no? Wait wait telling people intentionally try limit exposure deadly disease smarter people take absolutely safety measures? mean human nature doesn‚Äôt exist? last 2 weeks? Um.... required study? approach science general. stand corrected. Thank you. agree. Can't ignore systematic murder. How's Australia lockdown going? Since police defunded, BLM protestors deter crime enforce mask wearing without pay since help world. I‚Äôd vote Camacho every single time Trump. agree social distancing, dont like people anyway like space. mask....ehhh put bandana go stores, outside especially im myself. thought occurred before, never gone watching episodes House Hunters International. post universe sending sign.

Nobody fights cashiers it, wear protect others like normal people. Mitch McConnell! Everything bigger Texas Chicago! That‚Äôs specific I‚Äôll get haha. exemptions start reviewed, doctors give many pass review start losing licenses. Updated post. They're Mike Judge movies. Silicon Valley. better pay attention next project. Ambiversion I've adding everywhere, I'm pretty sure biologically teenagers adults species. mean could spread easily adult? could confused I'm thinking covid wait age consent. Lol stating obvious much Same! much extrovert seeing friends socializing like normally would painful, I've anyway care others' health, own! I'm lucky able work home, partner, outside walking around neighborhood nearby park, mostly leave pick groceries curbside, ordering takeout, etc. Occasionally pop store briefly (always masked) try limit trips. also love stand-up paddling, luckily sport natural social distancing (boards long, 99% time middle large body water wind). also wear masks trip water, sometimes others dock. socialized exactly 4 times since pandemic began small (7 ppl less) group friends, outside. see coworkers Zoom (sometimes day long), course in-person interaction. tough isolate much, resolve keep long to. feel privileged choice, since know many others don't. I‚Äôm moving Palm Beach end next month Interesting. want attack using drugs commonly used treat tumor growth or, according STATIN google, lower cholesterol.  
So thing grows due overly large amounts sugars cholesterols....that makes us fucked it? Sure. thinking last word used gave emotional weight descriptiveness needed. Good lord. Call dad, cult. 

He great fucking job approval rating plummeting country. Thousands deaths watch denying virus, anti-mask, getting tests PPE manufactured using defense production act, politicizing whole fucking thing first place. **the worst president** ever had. complete embarassment fucking joke. Americans die fucking moron president. 

Mark words, 2 years, pretend never even supported imbecile. 5 months people staying home?????? nothing said. You‚Äôre trying justify someone lying American public. you‚Äôre shifting goalpost another topic. course it‚Äôs ok wear mask. It‚Äôs ok mislead people order deprive something know save lives.  Sooo, never? 40 news? He‚Äôs Rick Grimes lied...and cost lives. believing ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm believing‚Äù. willing call people sides. clearly not. put us 1000 deaths today?  mean, gyms closed. expect running pick seem busier considering everyone working home. Actually, hard work.

I feel like that's redneck reasoning need understand this. mortality rates starta climbing up. Happened NY. anyone link ELI5 vaccine trials usually done, please? Also, covid-19 trials done differently? two years I'm reading.  That‚Äôs even true though. polarization vs. reality. Yes, right means you‚Äôre less likely to. majority people still (or think maybe bare minority people right?) There‚Äôs really evidence good economy (whatever means) would even help point. 4 months go. average person enough him.  Old 1980s game show host?

(They also policy direct family permitted) Yeah makes sense. protests probably less sophisticated I'd imagine would I'd honestly little idea. question asked dodged I'm finding I've very, happy isolating home. would prefer working home rest life. Prior realized much introvert actually am.

When say see people patios beer gardens, bother all? actually making somewhat angry see people public like this. I'm trying determine bothers me. fact take lightly want excuse continue isolating feel normal so. maybe combination both. know mean?

Just curious introverted well perceive that. Yea Manitoba 330 ~1.5x population .04 commercial driver's, agree ridiculously low. long got pool air-conditioned room ok :) person immigrate pandemic? can‚Äôt take stupid anymore. get flu COVID bad be? It‚Äôs sustainable economy rely smothers type jobs long term. fill cracks/spaces economy allow economy flexible. People willing negotiate boss actually leave job gig economy exists selling services individual always option. Short term gains 21st century way! People like going keep virus active many years come.

People like best prepared home-school kids, can't imagine allowed keep sending public school much longer. talking two colleagues today this. normal influenza season year, things going incredibly bad record deaths. normally wait til October get free influenza vaccine available hospital work at. year, soon available, paying one. plaintiffs drank much whey protein, clouded judgement induced delusions grandeur. jackass can't fly... bird ? That's bullshit comment though help all.

I'm pretty confident I've wearing mask longer pandemic continue so, damn mistaken think makes moron outside much. 

Our liberal suburb Chicago mask requiring start started summer concert series parks everyone distanced wearing masks. ok want normalcy. ok smart it. Love new york Rochester area.. pretty much everywhere go make worn..

Weird see someone one.. administration favor private schools, parochial school, vouchers school choice.

What better way force parents children camp turning public schools disease-ridden super spreader sites? problem! I‚Äôd surprised weren‚Äôt able schools tend make lot money international students doubt many international students year. hope things work out. Americans ears turned bread night , USA could feed world idiot sandwiches, also likely happen. 'Murcans believe Chuck Woolery Dr Fauci...yeah fucked. ""You‚Äôre assuming unreasonably high proportion actual cases confirmed. Even strong testing capacity it‚Äôs unlikely 1 4. beginning, probably 1 10 1 20.""
-- No, 1.6% IFR assumes 1/5th cases counted, calculated.

""To point deaths undercounted, it‚Äôs possible look overall excess deaths indicates ceiling believe 180,000 - 25% higher confirmed deaths. That‚Äôs substantial it‚Äôs joke compared undercounting cases."" - Agreed, argument there.

""EDIT: also third world‚Äôs IFR going skewed way lower lower life expectancy. Around half COVID fatalities 80, 2/3 70 90% 55. country like Uganda life expectancy 62, vulnerable population lot smaller."" 
-- Umm, rate fatalities overall deaths that's exposed. Nursing Homes institutions direct contact first wave infections pandemic (HCPs get infected first, still unknown carriers). That's disproportionate amount first wave infection health care facilities. 

Asian nations likely large family units, nursing homes. African South American countries, see nursing home spikes. sure alot deaths happening Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico.... on.

Viruses like night time, fall land evenly far eye see.

That ratio obviously change get exposed. lot younger people get exposed, lot die. 

As people exposed, die. Especially health care facilities around world fill-up. severe case, age, get proper care, die. Third world nations drugs, dialysis, ICU treatments. spread fast there, it'll spreading years, leaving horrid death toll. still bed you.

In addition, *do* need studies even 'common sense' things quite often things culturally accepted *obviously true* turn wrong. According Dante, foremost authority hell, cold parts.

That‚Äôs optimistic... kinda wish others seemed reasonable stayed instead resigning Danke, das hab ich jetzt gebraucht. :) go protest That's completely hyperbolic, passive aggressive take. true, everyone also responsible every common flu death prevent mask every year?

It‚Äôs normal typical sheep would think hoax, fact sense ‚Äúinvincibility‚Äù oh I‚Äôll never get type mindset. Fucking cucks. Weird southern states large minority populations, instead let's make race issue reasons.

If went Walmart saw associate practicing safe cleaning measures wearing PPE I‚Äôd feel better shopping there. Idiot. Obviously, hang masks one ear. Oh. Didn‚Äôt dive deep. Thanks educating poor soul. Damn u/tweellatte117 beat it, great comment According Harvard article:

‚ÄúIf get nasal/throat swab saliva test, get false negative test result:

About 40% time tested four days exposure virus.‚Äù

So, no, getting tested immediately plane ride show meaningful results see infected tell Karens wear masks reason wear clothes, spare us getting sick. asshole spreaders. thousands customers across country go without masks weekend? hope you‚Äôre try say masks cause harm lol Eh. Whatever motives, broadly agree point. Right pretty much news vaccines development amounts different companies jockeying position, building PR, ginning stocks. I'd prefer wait there's clear, definitive announcement made safe, effective vaccine able distribute inside specific timeframe. going guards circulating stores, escorting people pull masks down, _telling staff cover freaking noses?!_ ambassadors chicago gently remind everyone social distance. charity, give money charity, can't get back.

It spends 5% net worth every year charitable causes. way last long time, rather spending shutting down. He's right, way came awkward bizarre.

But absolutely, unnecessary travel time responsible spikes around country. 

Living Key West, FL town filled tourists over. random forums online people planning trips over. Insisting much need deserve vacation. Many NY, NJ, CT planning trips Florida either outrightly saying quarantine say quarantine order lifted next week nonsense. course people coming states without quarantine orders.

I'm saying ""northerners"", (even though live FL I'm northerner too) also influx people Miami-Dade every weekend, current epicenter. 

People done staying home! Drives crazy! Yes. It‚Äôs time delay increase risk contracting disease due protected time. *raises hand* Karen customer??

But poor leadership many people want inconvenienced wearing mask. blood disease, respiratory one. cherry picking pediatricians get story result want, good reporting. Really doesnt matter way going things. nothing done mitigate spread, hospitals *will* overrun quality care *will* decline across board.

And love God, Russia isn‚Äôt communist. Perhaps haven‚Äôt looked happened country USSR fell. Pffft, employees even wear masks correctly time think cave let customers without masks? Bull shit. use eraser, things look even better! Right-wing media obviously pushing narrative COVID isn‚Äôt bad. someone help understand that‚Äôs incorrect? specific claims:

[It‚Äôs different bad flu lying link one, commenters claiming infections going up, death rate not, showing whole thing overblown.

My understanding virus high mortality rate elderly watch them, seems dangerous long-term effects lungs brain many cases. Love jokes thrown around thread. bunch racists don‚Äôt care suppression killing minorities rich. mild, says mild cases recocer within week 10 days get behind that, would know abused hungry? Wouldn‚Äôt trust parents- case abuse especially can‚Äôt trusted. Yeah testing terrible Arizona. processing nearly enough tests day takes way long get results. I‚Äôm rural area doubt Walmart going actually enforce mask rule. workers already don‚Äôt sanitise carts like supposed ones wear masks usually still noses hanging out.  That's capitalism baby. think anyone buying houses 08 felt bad? Yes everyone North loves coming sweltering hot sticky South summer. Especially retirees... call them... Firebirds? yourselves

Good expression, *that's exactly people think they're doing*.

Dunning-Kruger effect best‚Ä¶ world get one conversations? Oh man, bad thing too. Wow, months Germany... every store... complex issue, black/white.

Isn't complex possible mess? considered model citizen response, next risk exposure events, true needs, hardly even getting groceries, always PPE'd. Even put 3 months behind rent. 

But work reopened decide giving best job I've ever (service industry), losing home, protecting society... taking risk hate, resources prepare what's coming protect wife, strangers damned.

I blame decisions, state federal governments is

&amp;#x200B;

Edit add obligatory conflict interest notice.

Disney bought national geographic everyone thought like that? keep thinking way get people wear masks reverse psychology. Like booth outside store says (for example), ""Free masks priority customers"" masks American flags them. 

And greeters conspicuously offer free masks people already masks get squirrelly people ask offered mask eventually they'll demand one. greeters say, ""But wear store may mistaken priority customer,"" Karen say, ""FUCK I'M IMPORTANT.""

It works rather well head. Home depot town required masks couple months last month limiting customers store well.   first, lets clear.  lay ""blame"" individual person, actively chooses use mask go public. 

Trump shitshow everything touches. virus , china, healthcare, russia. name it. 

Both I'm talking about. I'm talking FACT Fauci lied public, admitted lying, tried explain lied. period. hard stop. 

So saying Fauci's credibility ruined now. folks already believe him, clear excuse follow mask regulations. He's helping anymore lied national TV. Trump trusted 60% Americans anyway. 

but Fauci ruined credibility many more. government provides income feed families take care employees. government got step up. A4A members mandating masks planes, issue? covers major carriers. I'm sure little puddle jumpers don't, lot Flight Attendants.

To supports, guy could stop ""the dangerous masks""

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, win/win getting office Why?

Ah see edited comment. What? No. absolutely terrible advice opposite recommended protocol. Going hospital doctors office last resort.

If feel sick, test quarantine home, set telemedicine appointment doctor, take care body plenty fluids, rest, (and maybe vitamins like Zinc, C there‚Äôs evidence help). you‚Äôre feeling symptoms, get thermometer pulse oximeter Amazon. feel like can‚Äôt breathe, temp spikes high, O2 drops low 90s, go hospital.

There need go doctors office risk spreading it. waste hospital resources unless it‚Äôs definitely needed American democracy: government morons, morons, morons.   memo received said cannot stop anyone, we're tell required. Quick question, what‚Äôs 5% 7 million? 350,000? world think losing 5% population ok?  Hell, US whole barely lost war, wars, we‚Äôre talking state relatively small population. Good thing New York doesn‚Äôt follow ‚Äúlike 5%‚Äù mentality. one state would ante million people, definitely US lost combat. Well, lot out-of-work bar bouncers. Air travel would safer say bus travel way air circulates. still think probably bad risk much coronavirus right know plan enforcing this. ""reminded"" customer state mask policy said ""i asthma,"" others straight said wear one. People like freedom spread disease taken away them. Bye bye job. Yep, I'm going try bring backup pocket knife last defence hyperkarens  Lol [no good Sometimes gotta smack COVID motherfucker. TIL it‚Äôs called corral I'm confused trying say this. meaning? feel man, sorry understanding. many people willing turn violence anger come across someone disagreeing view points. I'm going honest, care violence property- case point police riots( police putting arms marching people around regard lack justice, ""not cops bad"" mantra works good cops act good hold bad ones accountable- like PD Flint joined protest instead attacking turning riot) people willing jump idea ""good beating"" set someone straight. silly barbaric. 

We need treat people expect intelligence reason discourse, otherwise never will. Sorry bud, need more, it‚Äôs honestly hope point.

Who could seen massive unstoppable outbreak coming? power make open, power close either. 

I'm sure that's true. think president ability declare national emergency take actions overrule governors' actions order keep people safe. think authority force states stop emergency measures governor thinks necessary, though. I'm 100% certain this, maybe someone else confirm either way. president doesn‚Äôt believe it. matter fact Republicans don‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs hoax Democrats. üôÑ brainwashed.

Furthermore, coronavirus deadly elderly, multiple democrat governors send covid patients [FUCKING NURSING WANT inflate deaths excuses shut businesses, make stay home, ruin economy. Wake. Up. fact don‚Äôt sneeze people lick people doesn‚Äôt mean anything. cough someone‚Äôs general direction pick virus.

Also, don‚Äôt know virus experience symptoms, appear 2 weeks first getting it. spread incubation period. 

Not wearing mask puts others risk puts risk. Tell me, feel violated wear clothes public?

Also, trust earth round? wondering. This. I'm carer work another country (meaning go work, go long month long shift go home month) I'm spending much longer quarantine try reduce risk bringing covid workplace. want that, boss vulnerable due preexisting conditions. spend next year social life shielding time it. I'm lucky job yes miss socialising restaurants much

Aside bike rides walks forest I'm back home, books shit done Okay. see confused. Please understand you, kids sacrifice personally want kids. makes plan easy (doable) you.

However know vast vast majority people want kids usually 2. 

From like stubborn learn. That's okay, figure later life realize wasted decades toiling needlessly.

you make sound like answer right simple, everyone ""stubborn learn"". *Everyone* reads obviously assumes talking strategy gets retirement year X maintaining basic 4 person family since that's almost cases. raising family simple others not. get wrong, advice actually great assuming want kids, covers what, like &lt;10% people? 

So acting way comment quoted took issue with. needlessly condescending afterwards providing plan hardly anyone could actually use. naive back lol.   That's awesome gives hope. 

ALL SCHOOLS SHUT END SEPTEMBER LATEST, might well start shut 100k+ cases per day. American? truly wonder civil war, many guns, civil unrest financial inequality. sat England say. I'm worried though, would incredible tragedy.  think America reaping sow right anti science defund education backfiring wild ride full swing now. states saw warnings, saw evidence went collectively ""nah, we're good"". I'm sorry ran sympathy ago.  need higher education standards US. shit embarrassing see fellow American OP self awareness would embarrassed themselves. guy actually deranged Stay well good choice...hope everything works out!!! Gay buff black dudes guns. racist asses go anywhere near there. Walmart employees needed another reason hate lives. basically teens young college folks throw wolves. I'm sitting Walmart breakroom. walmartians going pissed, ain't going happy tell wear mask. 

On flip side, I'm super happy they're this. wearing mask protects others rather them, dad extremely weakened immune system. everyone wearing one, I'll hopefully stay uninfected, means dad too. It‚Äôs 3 months since they‚Äôve peaked new infections, daily rate 98% peak April 7th. 0 deaths yesterday....and handful past weeks... percentage recovered people still issues 1 month, 2 months, 3 months later? Yup, thanks China. Though re-election unlikely, largely DNC thought wise put old, senile, creepy white man frontrunner whatever ungodly reason. forgot /s. think Lancet said Phase 1 data Monday. applaud completely honest. realize don‚Äôt like stores policy, go somewhere else. That‚Äôs kind thing makes happy see. It‚Äôs people think entitled walk anywhere regardless rules follow issue. can‚Äôt bear irony! UK control queues, worked well. March 8, 2020 scientist friends money motivation all. passion it. work made us work in-between test results. work retirement community... Important leading. People (even people know) straight ignoring advice experts finding sorts ways justify gathering groups wearing masks. seems lot people experiencing crisis fatigue want do. Also literally educate family members regarding posts they‚Äôve seeing Facebook ‚Äúdangers‚Äù wearing masks (my mom recently said saw something chemicals masks able get enough oxygen. Stupid Facebook). Also since beginning pandemic palpable resistance many ‚Äútold‚Äù do. Don‚Äôt forget president first seen public wearing mask mere days ago... still even suggested masks totally necessary. lot people look say ‚ÄúWell doesn‚Äôt - I?‚Äù

I went forest preserves outside city today husband went back home many large groups people socially distancing, wearing masks, walking 6 foot wide paths crossing complete strangers (also unmasked), unmasked bikers passing groups...
We masks ultimately decided risk wasn‚Äôt worth it. it‚Äôs Tuesday mind - PACKED. Every park went to, full people. gravel pull-off-the-road popular fishing area near parents‚Äô home I‚Äôve never - 15 years - seen completely full. many cars there, enough space someone walk them.

Grocery shopping night 4th July silly. waiting line respectful considerate patrons, us masked standing well apart other, couple came whisking store, walked right standing turned 12 inches away one said ‚Äúoh excuse me, pardon me‚Äù right face, make point. wearing matching blue jeans white shirts wearing masks buy five six large boxes canned coke sprite. probably throwing 4th July party. It‚Äôs shitshow. area I‚Äôm even bad - 80% time people wearing masks mindful physical distance, people generally smart choices they‚Äôre making. Lately I‚Äôve seeing two three smug, proud faces grocery store every time go (and go far less often used to) exercising right wear mask. takes one types people catalyst community spread. Travel states another issue assure people take advantage good deals.

Ok - venting. point healthcare issue, I‚Äôm afraid would sensible doesn‚Äôt reflect chaotic reckless noncompliance general public actually occurring here. FL resident here. Personally I‚Äôve everything right, god I‚Äôm tired. It‚Äôs really disheartening see people around taking seriously. Almost makes want stop caring continue going business home. Iowa. ridiculous. governor took anti mask stance. ridiculous views spread. local parents group already saying they're lining doctors write excusals kids wear masks. Ridiculous.  Confirmed: [Costco Homedics Yes: Flu vaccine, ddman9998.

The flu vaccine causes fever nearly 50% people take it. minor fever less 101.4? Yes still fever. hope good night too, crux argument horrendously flawed analogy worth noting One wealthiest cities planet, kiddo. Thanks reply question! Fun, got follow-up study right here.

Yep, still dumb fuck. Science cool.  dumbfuckistan Bingo. Seems like interested arguing. example convey idea. Picking apart idea message easy understand waste time. level correcting grammar spelling online. goodnight so, means open schools right cuz already virus? lol joke Trump can't fire Fauci, next read claims making Trump going fire Fauci, know ain't possible note chatter Fauci getting fired Twitter Simpleton chief tweeted Firefauci hashtags course moron followers wanted Fauci gone. available early they‚Äôre based vaccines developed SARS. faded drug companies didn‚Äôt invest full vaccine trials wouldn‚Äôt profitable. viruses close enough able adjust sort repurpose already understanding. Yeah surprised well able handle living alone first several months. really starting feel emotional psychological effects sustained periods time without in-person interactions. think belief early might beat reasonable time frame gave sort strength hope, things spiraling control slowly digesting fact social distancing could last indefinitely long amount time, hope gone. think misconflating science statistics. 

What vaccine exist? 

Think HIV. virus around decades, vaccine counter it. 

Is possible, matter many resources throw this...that still might find answer looking for?

It's like throwing darts dart board, hoping hit bullseye, even know bullseye exists, let alone located. 

What then? Keep throwing?

 Sounds great all, still increase chances bullseye exists somewhere.  Great Bot Ya, get vaccine continue wear mask long exists, nothing stupid people continuing spread it. Also, think point going sink everyone bad really is.... freezer trucks delivered Texas hospitals extra morgue space. Reality kept bay long. Eventually, people pay attention, everyone going know someone died this... especially since many people many hundreds facebook connections/acquaintances...at point truth becomes undeniable....I hope get bad, may. know Chicgao lot black black crime? virus hook worms definitely affected south negative way.  That‚Äôs sticky part don‚Äôt know yet. Realistically we‚Äôd wait severe damages lungs/heart gets checked months later (to see there‚Äôs healing). Iowa. governor awful. one states never sheltered place. Last week mayor enforced mask law one cities...the governor overturned it. Saying masks required Iowa mayors can't decide that. worry...our governor decided make alcohol drinks go restaurants law. waste. Unemployment benefits run month, total shutdown likely SAME. covid hit, watched Pandemic series Netflix. entertaining, struck ridiculous characters kept trying breach quarantine slip protective gear magically immune. died annoyed come on, idiots would act way, realistic all.

Until now, America. eliminates Centers Disease Control Prevention recipient information ‚Äî decision sparking controversy

Sparking controversy? really getting sick tired way media reports administration adults.

The Centers **Disease** Control longer allowed see data **disease**. absolutely retarded. North Korea level insanity. Everyone current administration prosecuted orchestrating attack American people. numbers getting better. Fauci seemingly recollection comments first quarter 2020 startling. 2020 track record abysmal.

**Q. would never happen here, would it? Locking 50 million people?**

**A (Fauci).** No, chance. would never seasonal flu bigger concern?**

**A.** right middle influenza outbreak, second wave. kids dying flu year, time, last decade more. went down, we're second wave H1N1 flu again, particularly serious children. right now, time people worrying going Chinese restaurant, threat country, we're pretty bad influenza season, particularly dangerous children.

**Q. bad going get?**

**A.** think going know next month direction going China. weather gets warmer, conceivable dynamics shift. never going disappear, 80 degrees Singapore they're infection there. dynamics shift. Instead accelerating might start go down. that's case, may time fall comes it'll like United States.

**Q. evidence Chinese fudging numbers?**

**A.** think so. think that's real. think that, mentioned, think 2%. think less they're counting lot people asymptomatic. fact stays 2% mean, just, math. think they're fudging numbers.

 ""If look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you,"" said. ""People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, is¬†absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" good news considerable experience coronaviruses. Everything we‚Äôve learned working coronaviruses, SARS MERS, helping us rapidly get jump things regard new virus.‚Äù [Fauci late January, recognizing unprepared are, warning harder find accurate quote Fauci, find talking absolute nonsense. rare occasion gets something right, he's already exhausted wrong answers. reminds demogorgan (sp?) stranger things lol Odds are, virus strengthens immune system. widespread re-infection observed. going make quip, saw name got distracted. 

Long live FSM Saying things done equally improbable pretty blatant fallacy.

Again, see Fauci vs track coach. say virtually impossible deny even slightest credibility Extroverts fucking worst. Like, full stop. Also, early stages medical community hard enough time getting hold masks gloves needed without worry entire population trying stockpile them.

At time, masks available far good doctors, nurses particularly symptomatic patients asymptomatic wore leaving shortage.

Now supplies ramped much clear asymptomatic carriers pass virus, makes much sense wear them. We‚Äôre middle viral pandemic. Everyone‚Äôs actions effect everyone else. It‚Äôs complicated . It‚Äôs baffling controversial issue refuse wear mask ? Nothing political . Nothing constitutional. We‚Äôre party imminent fascism wearing mask. 

A little altruism , compassion societal responsibility would go long way Plant City that's old normal. People don‚Äôt inconsiderate morons establishment get shut authorities, that‚Äôs going happen guy bar owners go completely underground set shop frat house somewhere charge cover house parties order make ends meet.

This country eventually converge another prohibition type era closures last significant time period. economics war. think PPP loans went big businesses? bailouts went banks. normal people got one-time check. Wow that's large trial. Absolute maximum 70% Americans would even agree take even free. I‚Äôm betting would looking closer 50% lucky free easy. like watching pigs farm squeal. Award smoking weed. Le Reddit moment. Don‚Äôt think takes study figure 1 out. thought states reported data government sites. 1st world üåé problems Many kids start 3 Well guys ate bullets. violence certainly answer bad guys. Worked pretty good them. Today overheard couple intentionally talking loud enough people could hear discus stupid whole idea wearing mask fake. Trying spread virus ignorance suppose. wanted gallon milk nearest store besides one 40 minutes away.   may something Michael Levitt‚Äôs hypotheses 20% infection rate equals herd immunity. posits significant % population already immunity covid 1.3 million dead said done would win. Well heck say earlier? could worn masks April May would sunshine rainbows. I'm condescending, I'm literally giving actual answers questions. tried lockdown people lost minds held protests open back up. best option. People lost shit opened middle rising pandemic outbreak it. told least keep social distance 6 feet people outside home. Instead, record crowds restaurants every holiday year. 

What makes think people going follow another lockdown wear masks, situation literally refused either things *separately* LA County 38% that.

Hmmm well that's going happen keep running true. kids tested last week google make phone calls 5 hours found place take them. Also, lot parents haven‚Äôt tested kids tests uncomfortable &amp; they‚Äôd rather put they‚Äôre asymptomatic. yet Producing acquired immune response seem difficult particular coronavirus, problems are

1. Evolved strains coronavirus.

2. Whether vaccine presents set complications COVID (loss taste, neurological disease, acute kidney failure).

It almost feels like don‚Äôt even need go outside anymore. 

Ever. Even pandemic stopped. jackass said thought going go away summer. Cuz: warmness. 

When people insanely high medical circles going realize coronavirus doesn‚Äôt give shit temperature outside?

Masks stop Corona. Regardless season. Hm, wonder why... Exactly great president would do, lower numbers means better numbers everyone! Economy2020/Lackofit2021 speaking family members, little hope year, hopefully 2021 better (/s great president clear) disagree policy oversight time thing would effectively happened policy. elderly COVID hospitalized sick return home without period short term rehab, long term care/nursing home, flat ""home"" return to. COVID positive elderly would ended returning showing nursing homes, long term care, whatever facilities essentially matter what. days ago sub included story 5-week-old dying it. one immune, unless already got immune. 

Young kids far lower fatality chances, long-term effects really need examined ASAP. Hopefully Wuhan kept good records tests kids caught it, see affected 6 months. Maybe everyone wear masks Halloween Walmart requires mask get in.

I'm amazed number people bring mask get take they're store. 'increasing evidence' - shit ain't increasing, 100% true. Dr. Fauci great American history look kindly contributions fight. see absolutely reason distrust him, every reason distrust Trump nose mouth.... think need explicitly add end Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea even China managing COVID-19 exponentially better Western countries ***simply wear mask whenever leave house***. outright sheer ignorance arrogance wearing one many western countries significantly worse outcomes managing COVID-19. wear one time (Australian) whenever leave house many people suspicious (because white wearing one) actively step away providing social distance ***piece mind***. ignorant masses wear mask mean bloody fool!

Nobody needs Corona snitch. what's wrong America seatbelt *doesn‚Äôt prevent* accidents.

Which chose analogy.

It **reduces** injury. even accidents, **some**. Moderna founded 10 years ago never sold drug vaccine before. trying develop vaccine record time. Thank FINALLY giving link (though know tried hard so)

You quote entire thing. difficulties occur trying calculate vaccine-attributable risks. Clinical trials routine childhood vaccines shown fever typically occurs 1%‚Äì10% vaccinees [34], frequent 30% among vaccinees receiving multiple vaccines DTwP vaccine [34, 35]. temperature subjects studies seldom fever typically self-limited. **The studies, however, provide valid comparison rate fever among unvaccinated children similar age determine ‚Äúbackground rate‚Äù elevated temperature populations. Calculation vaccine-attributable risk was, therefore, impossible.**

It literally says can't attribute fever vaccine. 

I think tried hide this, that's hesitant give link. HALF? Wow. Ahead rest America. would wager alone sentiment, friend... get it, you? family taking money years, give fuck less 10k end meet end pandemic. little assets laughable even consider throwing hundred bucks towards pointless will. maybe dad brothers would highly appreciated couple grand Star Trek comics? Hmmm.

Dumbshit. Ope. ""comment"" yup. vaccines generally cause immune response. mean duh. immune response include headaches, fever, chills etc... really divided Europe though. seems like author surprised different countries rules, regulations attitudes dealing - like everywhere else world. big number fit 32-bit word, big number. cold kill Coronarivus. Gone Halloween people saying. 3 million cases zero. like that. almost like Trump compromised lmao Ministry Love, soon open. Today purchased socks marketed human names man. want trial. Im optimistic discovery better treatments we‚Äôll see less would‚Äôve happened couple months ago. mother law told us hospital (bellevue, wa) something like 80% success rate getting patients vents national avg something like 60%. hope rates getting better everywhere here. hard say precaution recommend wearing masks?

Also, fuck health care workers wearing masks since however damn long? Obviously protects something. 

Not trying sound upset said, frustrated called leaders. Yes(in industry) No. 

His hitch mask (or lack thereof) recommendation back march 2020. 

I think PPE gained last months worth ongoing shutdowns spikes cases people wearing masks recommended time wear masks. 

Not there's huge portion people jumping ""government get you"" train keep using Fauci's lie excuse trusted. 


We huge issue masks, due part dr.fauci stating : ""there's reason wearing mask"" yes Coronavirus reason. mask shrimp make practice social distending relative size. Simple. Shut cocktail bars cocktails parties. Lastly, close borders swimming shrimp ontil flatten curve. Pretty sure virus parents grandparents ones pay it. LIFO makes little sense here.

If it‚Äôs important process pending tests one day, split narrow criteria ‚Äúcritical priority‚Äù queue regular queue. Run critical priorities, fill day‚Äôs remaining processing capacity population density weighted random selection tests. Toss rest. Yeah good luck that. live NJ, one states handling things better, yet Facebook feed filled jabronis saying refuse wear masks. Three 14 patients given highest dose experienced severe side effects, dose used larger trials.

The 250 dose discontinued this.

We'll see lower dose, also successful, makes Phase III. Cautious optimism right feeling have. sure legal. 

I also doubt hospitals comply. work administration general, though VA sorta-kinda-maybe-slightly federal. President let set law.

Should also add critical component going long vaccines provide immunity for. it‚Äôs months, going harder production get need 80% Covid deaths make states desirable?

 wonder total numbers look like. Sorry Texas, Florida takes cake:

Free meal customers wear rich, coming Anthony ""no reason regular people wearing masks"" Fauci. Thanks sharing! I'm millennial never made full recovery 08. lucked Colorado housing market recently sold. I'm washing much debt life can, wife China living zero bills. enough future buy house put kids school ten'ish years. Florida 130 people die today; that's awfully high quite 8x lower. assume Florida also undercounting, multiple credible parties mentioned. 

New York likely also far cases people would get arrested reporting Yes, introvert hates going stuff. get it. basically trying tell huge chunk population something hardwired do. people dropping dead streets can't process go it. really get mad seems like huge shift behavior people can't even start good habits little little. good around. ""give football give death""

""... I'll drag damn country me"" Yes, it‚Äôs important. 

An important thing consider treatments vaccinations, widespread concept medicine - benefits outweigh risks?

Essentially, everything side effect. determined case case benefits worth side effects. Here, may come individual determine whether prefer fever, whatever side effect vaccine has, would take chances covid.

Lots unknowns. I‚Äôve got autoimmune disease I‚Äôll take chances vaccine. Maybe others healthy prefer chance covid. hope neither long term effects, I‚Äôd put money vaccine safer severe cases disease. They‚Äôve always like this. look back even parents realize hindsight boomer dipshits. Less flights please. hospitals report new demand still report CDC? then? people actually *like* meeting talking new people. Listening good music, live otherwise. Supporting local businesses, trying new drinks. 

It's bleak everyone. Memo hospitals: ‚ÄúMake data public.‚Äù No. isn't. There's good chance GOP tries steal election. Trump refuses leave. different world point. GOP worn welcome USA. care made Malaysian meth lab. works, I'll take fuck states low total number cases? testing what? get Vermont since there‚Äôs less million people living doesn‚Äôt Kentucky like five million?

Whatever happening Tesla, organization taking proper precautions care long make money. Much like countries gotten handle virus, entirely possible conduct business safely without risking health people. money people care about. Feels like second time year declared war American people. I'm pretty sure one likes motion tony hawk. Apart importance gaming history consider original final fantasy great game. time much mass taxing organs. Muscle less taxing fat still requires heart work harder. also plenty lineman insanely strong pretty fat. head NFL executives reasonable people, extremely concerned player safety, surely prioritize monetary considerations. expect league fully accede players' demands. ""But! That's EXACTLY 'they' would want!"" convinced somehow reading correctly. fuck really happening? Keep mind IHME model assumeds certain level mobility. look last chart, assume Florida open 100 percent normal. Florida hospital utilization likely less. lot less.

IHME intended predict likely future. intended model specific scenarios help states _choose_ best future them. People often criticize IHME inaccurate misunderstand purpose. case states dire trouble right now, IHME model going accurate. That's states see rising cases, look IHME model, relaxed choose different option. That's for. least aptitude test theory. original thinking. Today, people would looked video youTube lemon juice makes invisible conspiracy conceal information public. dreamed over? literally understand. feel like I'm getting trolled. self-respecting person think Gavin handled perfectly? criticism justified?

Funny say that.I reading article one local newspapers general realm Fauci-Trump-Sports-Science-etc author acknowledged ways Fauci ""no slouch"" listing one major viral event next. drifted moment think,""history correct this. hope lifetimes."" 4-8 weeks? Masks? real? make sure get f*ck vote. American...yeah, you‚Äôre absolutely right. course, northeast (the one part country seems know it‚Äôs doing) so...maybe regional thing said. Ugh. Black Lung probably taught fuck respiratory illnesses They‚Äôre sending back without masks here. I‚Äôm teacher I‚Äôm scared. Why? 

America done every thing related dumbest way possible. stop now? still laugh them. worry better us Texas people think extra terrestrials going come save us. protests certainly part. Don‚Äôt second, believe massive groups protestors didn‚Äôt spread virus. tester allowed ask people participated protests. Give us thoughts lost primary, that‚Äôs correct, she‚Äôs candidate upcoming general election. try primaries next time around though Children among men scenario right It‚Äôs not. term ‚ÄúSerious Adverse Event‚Äù specific set events (death, life threatening events, etc). 

I used work clinical trials. lime coke removed? Ok, lets recap:

1) phase unacceptable unusual amounts side effects, looking decent efficacy;

2) completely new technology successfully used vaccine ever;

3) company withholding data sparing government regarding oversight (the company rejecting normal oversight);

4) founders sold ton stock right releasing data 8 people trial data

This shady hell, getting waayyy much side effects, looking really bad, imo. Thankyow thankyow...

r/coronavirus... place get downvoted saying wear mask public. Lol last weeks 992 due holiday weekend back log though? Ya got source that? wearing mask nothing protect you. protects around asymptomatic positive. That's everyone needs wear mask.

Not touching face public, washing hands thoroughly going public, social distancing protect you. That's good yet. little feelings mega rich Ask Japanese friend any. Look number testing have. control number cases Olympics cancelled cases miraculously rises. Leave discretion numbers. merely suggesting u need mask u social distance, much better ... Disney already make movie Mark Wahlberg? think supporters ignore stupid abhorrent things says does? There's something every day Except effective guess I‚Äôll postpone hopes getting shit together age 25 age 35 whole notifiable disease. sure enforce one posibility federal public health funding tied implementing certain things giving president power. fucking shit. That‚Äôs continue mess. states took seriously March others didn‚Äôt. Turning legitimate health crisis political issue also ruined ability make significant progress. don‚Äôt want Fauci VP, don‚Äôt think either. He‚Äôs good current job. Trump actually stupid enough fire Biden wins, hope Biden reinstated him. Also 77 year old Presidential candidate 79 year old VP would bit nuts. Ty link. love AT

Here's one studies point towards immunity, cases reinfection purely anecdotal there's evidence it.  expected US take seriously amount covid deaths surpassed ones 9/11. Quickly found optimistic thought was. Pretty soon we‚Äôre going 9/11 every day mismanaged country been. Stay safe people. Yes, understand, it‚Äôs unfortunate BLM protestors looting target indoors. There‚Äôs way Fox News. thought whole thing. Hey moron want go out, actually go regards safety others beyond moron. Can‚Äôt lie say haven‚Äôt tempted airfare travel prices lately, obviously I‚Äôd putting others risk selfish reasons.

Beer well?!? 2020 increasingly becoming year worst nightmare. Child's play. area Texas saw 1000% increase. Exactly. makes even obvious Fauci one saying wear masks back March.  reasoning behind makes sense. want cause panic leave zero masks hospital workers. know, ones really need them. go ahead think want.  get they're choices. reasonably can't expect people kids retire 40. vast majority people aspirations children want first one 40. kids 40, can't retire even plan. Retire earlier sure, 40. plan simply align vast majority people even disciplined. unreasonable look others ""not getting it"" solution leaves majority followers unfulfilling life.

When people want retire early still also want live life least basic wants, like kids. kids selfish want like new iphone $300 shoes, something gives life purpose partners want responsible means. Suggesting kids something avoid money someone wants kids ignorant opinion.

For small minority want kids, advice would useful, else no. literally said test, numbers go down. stop testing he's coming side. He'll get way.

Now situation better, citizens masks make mandatory.

Strong leadership needed streamlined response; chaos won‚Äôt cut it. supply shortages complicated logistical issues require cohesive cooperative response top bottom. difficult get cooperation without strong majority science-believing, competent elected officials. That‚Äôs unlikely highly polarized way Americans vote. 

Basically, easily understand pandemic exert‚Äôs pessimistic opinion. get quickly possible it‚Äôs imperative cooperation international allies addition domestic national, state municipal governments. don‚Äôt know that. abuse. shameless marketing. even South Korea. Look western Europe, got hit pretty hard responded lockdown getting back running again. Meanwhile Florida. don‚Äôt know letting people catch covid would result herd immunity. variation responses may provide level duration immunity needed that.

I say think rates flu much lower year. think lot people get flu shot. Additionally, many people wearing masks, social distancing, vigilant hygiene. going decrease chances getting flu unintended consequence. 

Still, get damn flu shot. Sorry, actually laugh. cry They'll need teleconference doctor since need blood thinners, carefully timed dose steroids. Oh vitamin supplements. Misleading, sensationalist otherwise, still died ""standing inline"" medical test. Remember reports Italy people streets. seems harbinger fear... Yeah let's give data one institution exists purpose, one thing trained literally reason created. Unpleasant, unpleasant. bad chaos could avoided, countries prepared handled pandemic far better. vaccine retake every 3 weeks rest life. fighting captain obvious role days... absolutely high. way. That‚Äôs true. Regardless people‚Äôs opinions whether smart not, honest goes long way! idea vaccines induce strong durable immune response goes beyond antibodies. there's much focus media antibodies, real long-lasting immune response based b-cells t-cells. vaccines seem produce high amounts important cells. worst case scenario need booster every year every years.

what i'd worried virus way subverting durable immune response despite vaccination, fact antibodies fade months surprising. shit. don‚Äôt event need study know common fact. informative - I‚Äôm US also cannot understand failure see facts.

And survive (or don't) get wear mask.  fucking way tenet released 4 weeks bad China right answer beginning. Probably right answer.

Hey asshole, read article. headline lie, never compares Spanish Flu. author article completely made unless someone wants get quote Fauci specifically compares Spanish Flu. Respect! You‚Äôre lucky!

""Well, states it..."" Stop circle jerk Technically correct, putting practice almost whole thing Ofcourse chance may never get vaccine we'll probably end finding form major treatment.

It depends why.  Sarah Gilbert Oxford explained terms vaccine development, means something

Thailand, 76.9, Vietnam 75.3. still places plenty people vulnerable group COVID-19.

And we're western first World country who's life expectancy dropping instead rising.

In words, every generation boomers lower life expectancy compared Canada/Australia EU. Lol no, still massive support public. Yeah let guy hate black people Fauci said knew time advice incorrect, misled public. okay says lot. God hope find something Christmas least. situation horrendous over. Lol. Something killed 500k compared something killed 50 million people. pandering, useless, article. Probably told they‚Äôd fired didn‚Äôt.

That whole family better isolate get back Brooklyn. hope she‚Äôs planning going door door delivering mail Covid understand, traditional vaccines work Coronaviruses. unless peer reviewed studies, pharmaceutical companies say whatever want.

When birdflu thing years ago, company promised Tamiflu (I think) works made ton money this. Turns out, drug work all. Companies saying drugs work, first vaccines works make lot money.

The driving factor safety efficacy vaccine, money, profit greed. LMFAO, way prove ""may"" part. Keep mind there's selection bias internet. encounter lot worst-case anecdotes.

I go SSRIs crippling panic attacks 2008. read much internet people sorts terrible side effects... like people inject drugs penises able sex. doctor explained side effect profile probabilities decided positive EV. ended 90+ percent mild, short-term side effects.

Nonetheless, coronavirus terrifying whatever get it: wear masks, practice social distancing, avoid large gatherings, work home possible. Even 2- 3-sigma outliers (and I'm saying are) there's certainly upside getting disease. mentioned 10x Pneumonia number couple times. source that? went looking see looks like jump around 3-4k previous year's springtime around 9K past big jump, near 10x.

I tried couldn‚Äôt hospital send it‚Äôs data CDC HHS?

Also, since hospitals privately owned, good luck getting comply format. It‚Äôs uneducated... it‚Äôs cities full liberals follow trend. sad truth Democrats even worse republicans. destroying country letting whatever happen. suck trump better pick. strokes ego right. pasted top-level comment. Pretty sure lot people ara aware social distancing snd masks, aware risks strong reason take risks. also, maybe, protestors, surely mean include wearing masks social distancing protest, know, wearing masks social distancing?

How people attending rallies certain candidate whose base also tends get tangled science denial? choose pissing Trump GOP, saving lives thousands Texans.  hard choice. 

Abbott‚Äôs gonna lose, Lt Gov Dan ‚Äúhappy dead grandparents‚Äù Patrick going run GOP candidate. 

Whether wins another matter Uruguay great work. small country population 3 million, different approach. 

Also, virus came America Latina travelers, Argentina uncontrollable number coming Italy Spain, everything explode there... lot infected people know Covid. 

And also think depends mix luck civil responsibility. he‚Äôs willing let speak impact masses it‚Äôs worth ‚Äúnice‚Äù get message out. came hard Trump beginning current Fauci smear campaign would‚Äôve started much earlier opinions would‚Äôve buried. Really point, let Florida.... Florida death. people follow rules usa?

Yes federal government joke right parties incompetent level astronomical. change need look home first. people like blame others. see family got virus blame local government even though told go out, party visit parents home. 
Of course, many blame Donald Trump.  trying manipulate numbers. ‚ÄúIf change numbers virus disappear.‚Äù Right taint mask go work.

There article 2 hair-dressers positive wore masks went work infected none clients.

People gotten stupid comes virus. Life go on.

What plan negative? Get tested everyday? states report numbers different demographics. know aggregate collected somewhere, believe states give information consistently.

Very different flu. Flu generally effects young old, middle aged people usually strong enough immune system respond well medicine. 

This virus effects older numbers increase age underlying conditions.

There still around 2% chance hosptialization younger ages (probably way kids never tested), death rate extremely low probably like .01% (don't think seen enough data total less .01 live currently big question mark lots kids never tested could postive).

We kind know situation now, except much kids spread virus. Many home outbreak. things like school concern high percentage kids get also spread easily teachers, workers parents.

The huge concern fall. flu going around kids effected flu. Causing different influx hospitals. Combined coronavirus. Luckily flu shot therapeutics flu. I'll get popcorn cuz going fun watch. see viruses I'm one. colleagues already got sick leave. self declared. mention fever stay home. I'm major surgery likely stay 2-4 days

Doing alone freaking bit ...and poof! virus ‚Äúmagically‚Äù disappears. Several lab companies process coronavirus tests Florida reported incomplete data state, officials said Tuesday, creating discrepancies numbers public health officials rely track pandemic across communities.
In cases, labs reported positive test results, report number negative test one example, small batch tests lab Orlando Health tested 522 samples, according state report, 512, 98%, positive virus.
Dr. George Ralls Orlando Health said hospital system found 5,206 positive tests 53,932 administered throughout hospitals, overall rate 9.7%. . . .and **everywhere**. know, competent government would seen going Italy, Spain France said ""This shit coming us, we're lucky hit YET, shit hit fan take seriously."" Yeah. It‚Äôs important know vast majority symptoms. ones contacted refused testing denied presence symptoms.  article misleading missing important information. man getting COVID test upcoming surgery. fact ‚Äúcold‚Äù tells caretakers observing patient. DC fumbled entire country early outbreak, admit hundred times better states. DC‚Äôs 8 week lockdown, slow reopening much better FL, TX, CA, AZ, TN, SC, MI, AL, LA, NV, OH, NC, KY, AR, WA list goes on.

If FL followed DC‚Äôs footsteps, hospitals wouldn‚Äôt overwhelmed. Best buy zero control delivery guy does.. let's pretend WH source. Inferiority complex. probably smarter realize. feel like keep reading every couple days everyone gets wrong idea. 

Antibodies thing gives immunity. cells well going latest research happening patients Covid. People need remember thing around 4-5 months infected million millions people. reinfection cases....that shows something today? Gonna cost him. American Christians fake Christian. worship money capitalism. came say thing, get popcorn ready people going train wreck. believing media never questioning ""intelligent"" ? Ironically, related old version natural selection. There's reason *literally* every society taboos rotting corpses, feces, etc. things smell *horrid* humans *specifically* harbingers disease. us find things like vomit, snot/mucous, etc gross well, reason - early creatures (*well* hominids, probably *mammals*) avoid poo, vomit, snot, etc likely get sick die, ones squeamish tended survive disease outbreaks often pass germaphobic genes next generation.

Frankly, nothing disease, probably *would* wind natural selection protected possibly even generations - genes already exist, eliminate carry it. I'd wager we'd wind mix genes favoring immune systems could fight COVID-19 effectively, possibly greater sensitivity anxiety taking shelter disease outbreaks popped community. *really* hope become thing though, I'd rather vaccines work disease would simply go away - worst deal annual COVID booster alongside flu shot.  fact wasn‚Äôt publicly announced White House, instead reported media, shows shady is. Historically, CDC recipient national public health data. would think change data collection protocol would warranted press conference. People shit Florida least get tested quickly. *strokes chin* ya dont say they‚Äôre Wal-Mart shoppers, they‚Äôll exquisite physical shape impeccable manners, wearing top-hats, coats, tails. Covered jewels finery. perspective main problem can't see quality life direct result freedoms (as far see) quite willing throw away. question freedom v. life, rather life v. life.

And I've twisted anyone's words, think. common sense read started testing covid19 rates waste water big towns Europe, would give us hints second wave, especially takes account asymptotic well...

All think [Poo now. removes CDC reporting module instead allows hospitals choose 4 modules. report state health department, HHS portal, 3rd party vendors publish public uri standardized format. methods end consumer HHS.

Now hospitals choice report numbers using four different modules, mean report four modules pick choose module report use? seems different agencies different statistics reported, going one central module total statistics give clear picture entire data within US. Agency 1 1/3 total numbers Agency 2 2/3 numbers overlap two agencies. different agencies may protocols extrapolate data. efficient way ""run numbers"" therefore give us clear picture happening US. know health insurance companies heavily rely statistics make decisions level care customers receive much willing pay physicians hospitals. can't help wonder affect US citizens health insurance. level care improved data? Well shit Sherlock it‚Äôs getting worse 
(no offense sounded like funny reply) That‚Äôs thought went public. Even old people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. sure it‚Äôs minority. Seems pretty 50/50 Loyalists actually rtft replying know ignore half-assed completely-uninforced alleged attempt controlling travel. feels better go tantrum scream ""MOVE!"" it. need emotional outlets days. Come on... flu... /s people read mass productions, suddenly you‚Äôll people ignore social distancing etc good shape I‚Äôm Canadian. Don‚Äôt forget White House controls data CDC virus beat then!!! new cases, it‚Äôs miracle, like Dear Leader said! initial infection potential function likely virus infect host never exposed it. We're talking natural immunity result exposure coronaviruses, part R0. 

R0 result initial conditions system. Prior immunity resistance exposure initial condition. might entirely wrong would think might also need good working treatment well, mass production great 6+ billion vaccines absolute shitload I‚Äôm sure really possible end January, hope I‚Äôm wrong. agree, left right matter right regards virus. mask mask judged, includes mandating masks position power so. politicize idea masks public right abhorrent well exactly nation's true enemies want. education system point though CLEARLY shown flaws (like anybody thought good education first place, still) severe lack critical thinking thinking things way through.

Pretty much everybody wants virus dealt many us seem want put effort required make goal reality. add individual cult personality could actually used good got buggered too. still idea MAGA masks within weeks advertisement savvy businessman, I'm trying keep comment level-headed I'm gonna stop here.


- disappointed American two asthmatic family members referring fact Chinese vaccine Blitzkreiged Phase III, said taking Brazilian American vaccine (ignoring Chinese) Oh agree absolutely. can‚Äôt imagine stressful must single parents navigate this. numbers go way WH controls reporting data. Bolsonaro isn't. He's trying, he's not. virus fault. virus cooperating administration followed orders CDC instead. Lol who‚Äôs misrepresenting statistics? You‚Äôre one saying ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt enough evidence‚Äù presented evidence, denying anyway. *eradicate* (your word, mine) every strain influenza. There'd fewer cases virus would still around infecting people.

It also infect humans. It'd still spreading among animal populations. Focus no-bid contracts rather advice given. That's corruption is.

In terms advice: that's pay consultant for. They'll give nice big powerpoint pack options, pros cons adopting given one recommended course action. advice. requirement save whole bunch cost options provided going extremely unpalatable. Sometimes shown options lead change overarching strategy (e.g. want save $Xm going need starve people - either change strategy accept consequences). story actually shows system working intended.

Now think organisations need consultants tell things that's another story. Nomadic Plague. Oh yeah, destroyed respiratory system cardiovascular system, everything's swimming. that's left order fast food three times day wait flu season arrive! include Sams Club too? Yup. feel betrayed. point shocked witnessed one person. guess takeaway hey, fuckers gonna die, they're real heroes.

Rather adopt strategy like many countries have, consistent mask wearing distancing, realistic approaches contact tracing testing they've gone route - convincing portion population people going die, that's is.

It's sad people callous, stupid can't realize they're risk too. probably figured cheaper keep replacing retraining new employees. Since failed stopping bad habits, grew entire world see them. nothing left country cannibal snakes &amp; alligators eating themselves, taught children nothing brute competition.

I believe referencing original latin meaning countryside rather derived meaning operation. Rights vs privileges level govt decisions made bearing level risk involved 

Nor bearing morally culpable taking unnecessary risk others lives 

Your argument weak ‚Äúright‚Äù establishment like bar either. privilege afforded provided follow whatever expectations establishment whether it‚Äôs showing ID, getting bar fights wearing masks.

No one blaming ‚Äúall mayhem death‚Äù non mask wearers.

You arguing absolutist statements made it‚Äôs easier rhetorically honest.

Walmart taking seriously governor Florida... Dr. Doom one kid OK masks another similar sensory issues hates wearing greatly, touches constantly, inevitably damages way. Like me, I'm convinced wearing one much good others, given face touching leads to.

The thing ""stopping virus"" basically futile. Unless believe effective vaccine truly possible short time scale (and I'm quite skeptical), question far lengthen time everyone exposed. concern early ""hospitals overwhelmed"" New York different rest country extremely early even knowing treat. see much good evidence support ""overwhelmed"" concern. (There's ton misrepresented evidence news stories, actual hard data lacking.) Absent that, matter shut everything let trickle society pull bandaid. me, cost terms mental health unemployment worth potential benefit former.

When people say ""the economy"" worth people dying, initial thought billion dollar companies get quite rich. hurts us small businesses layoffs. portion people return workforce, people will, average, end less healthy (not mention risk substance use overdose). I‚Äôve felt unsafe work mandatory mask place (My work made masks mandatory associates workers). customers travelling Toronto area Stage 2 already weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm happy region made masks mandatory. I‚Äôll feel safer work now. really hope trying argue tens thousands people packed shoulder shoulder streets together, yelling, chanting screaming, many wearing masks, huge virus spreading risk. would beyond retarded, even leftie. 

Also, pretty hard cite numbers left wing politicians covering asses specifically instructing contact tracers avoid asking people attended protests. Florida native, assure &amp; everyone else they‚Äôre going wait last possible second.  Slow news today I've believing happen long time now. province phases closer openings job site tries lift restrictions, think going get worse we're stuck inside. one else seems think though.

Definitely take time reflect accomplishments proud [You've paying That's esentially said. virus less hosptializations deaths compared flu younger people.

The coronavirus statistics start rise based age. Lots older people also hospitalized die flu.

Just pointing states report numbers have. look statistics states confirms risk value lower based age.

That said data pretty much confirmed accurate reporting, test kids enough know sure.

Also statistics say anything transmission big unknown. Thus data (espcially kids) everyone wear mask assume people encounter could virus. plot twist: Walmart funds profits youtubers record videos Anyone who's willing led never able stand own. fun Depends where.

I think you‚Äôre overestimating much big companies actually care know finding goes ""no shit sherlock"" file, make wonder disagreeableness correlated too. Agreeable people likely avoid anything could hurt people's feelings. agreeable person want tell person standing little closely back up.  also tend prioritize showing friendliness self-preservation. Shoulda started 7 months ago! private healthcare conservatives don‚Äôt want know about. Math lie. it: . wait times ridiculous. majority tests PCR based, non-pandemic times would typically take couple minutes 4 days (if POC far wherever test performed).  
The reason long wait times due labs overwhelmed tests. heavily infected areas (by percent population), labs turn away hundreds tests day. leads tests getting backed up. 
The fault goes large chunk healthcare industry US taking responsibly. labs started developing test early enough implement effectively. Took long enough. Costco trailblazer already done this.

Personally, still keep touch dozens nurses, physicians, techs I‚Äôve worked predominantly treating Covid patients. anecdotal, gives perspective. Get outside city limits different world. 

Outside city filled classic red, Trump loving people income brackets education levels. Unfortunately, many live bubble. overwhelming majority coworkers (actual RN‚Äôs!!) 100% certain blown proportion media radical left. cite fact CDC changed guidelines take as, obviously, institutions idea talking about.

KNOW hospitals misrepresenting data use examples like ‚Äòso-and-so‚Äôs friend works city says listing strokes Covid-19‚Äô. Completely ignoring patients hospitalized, testing positive, seeing COVID-19 cause blood clotting issues which, wait it... cause strokes. simply lying. Smdh. also assure me, condescending manner, people tested count positive CDC results come back positive, people counted twice. numbers wrong blown way proportion. absolutely loath ‚Äòrestrictions‚Äô work ‚Äòforces‚Äô us PPE use. such, rebel using form protective measures, even social distancing, outside work loudly boycott business require masks gives appearance bowing pressure liberal Governor.

Hearing coworkers- educated people nonetheless- talk work like listening backroom podcast Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson host. It‚Äôs terrifying. way sort rational conversation I‚Äôm baffled anyone masks become political issue Yeah, serious clickbait.

If anything shows masks help. Thats literally it. correct moment schools reopen. sad see America American people mess covid,

My youngest sibling immunocompromised, number people see around daily say even BOTHER protecting people like insane.

Overall agree anywhere indoors without lot masks considered dangerous. Something something project Lightspeed  Yeah, germany italy good military they'll put signs, retailers grocery stores indication, stores enforce all. last 7 days 20 death.

people say "" medical issue can't wear mask""  get response "" Well safe hear need leave find way wear mask""  many people ""medical issues"" suddenly wear mask hilarious sad.

Edit: words best English sometimes. content going astronomical Lawsuits. Walmart probably trying avoid potential lawsuits.  Well, alternative still thousands students parents dead (exacerbating problems scenario) weeks future. certainly going super spreaders every day across country 3-4 weeks start seeing teachers parents die mass. government could give us $2000 per resident ($1000 kids?) month, mandate stay home orders maximum degree reasonable, actually enforce orders (hand masks first course, fines repeat offenders), come plan better online distance learning slowly reopen emphasizing mask use prevent another lockdown future. Suspend evictions mortgages people receive stimulus fucking acknowledge severity situation we're in. point government money this, they're intentionally keep appearances long enough Trump win reelection. That's they're CDC turn health data, lie numbers 2 months we're hitting 3K+ deaths day like April. get it, handled damn thing competently probably would done it. Maybe Grim Reaper needs follow Gov.

I think (can't check exact moment, Michigan gov page good data) Michigan reports separately, typically counts ""diagnostic"" positives towards daily increase #s. Also, New Zealand victim success. argue lower priority widespread outbreak.

They everything right, also means lower risk. distribution, they'd one last goes fairly. citizens currently getting sick actually back somewhat normal Stock market also go uncertainty. Trump made certain get increasing cases doesn‚Äôt care.
Also brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Chuckle anymore! So.. time? minimum governments access choose horse back participante pre-manufacture/pre-buy. is, Canada (just example) able buy full cost manufacturing capability used manufacture vaccines AstraZeneca, Moderna, etc. starting _right now_. Including manufacturing equipment, syringes, needles, vials, boxes ship shit in. Everything. includes _very expensive capital equipment purchases_ startup costs share need encourage option. Maybe Canada's horse fails. Maybe back two horses. Maybe decide wait. Maybe decide pre-manufacture enough vaccine health personel. building vaccine manufacturing best interest every one us pre-manufacture way one country's win result another country's loss.

There steps need take. that's start.

Apparently they've infiltrated Walmart too. saw people replies walmart tweet saying illegal ADA walmart face class action case this, army lawyers walmart employs already thought details. fair, time overwhelming medical consensus across whole western world. Europe, Britain, Australia New Zealand recently changed stance masks. Easy way identify troublemakers. dealt next condition placed ability buy food. point gonna happen people consider wearing mask act faith God , consider political stance display bravery , consider way express rights freedoms ... going maskless protest ! mention whackos psuedo studies say wearing masks basically poison . people committing assaults making threats asked wear masks ...

Why Trump say would invite Russia G7 May 30, 2020? can't tell Japan fanatic job shit job ( USA included metric way far shit job part everything else comparison fantastic).  Massive population size, also dense urban centers. plots, looks like actually 2nd wave ""beat"" first wave. read article, still enough shame delete comment made random shit up. hope turns one rare individuals test positive weeks months Bolsonaro's case hopefully years. well looks like shall see summer fares......damn education thing. people high school diploma click propaganda Facebook post watch YouTube think know brainwashed college liberals. agree virus serious buy ""masks mental health consequences"" argument either, mean nonsense.

Please vote reason. Joe many failings, near level insanity. Uh oh inbred anti maskers gonna shop now? See now, wasn‚Äôt hard, it? Yeah well Europeans reputation told forced. doesn‚Äôt matter crazy scenarios are, top outsider, understanding Murica... like closing business? shit Good. man withstand falsifications administration tries put ‚Äúfacts‚Äù hero eye Assuming everyone wears masks, socially distances, rate infection low enough, states absolutely open up. South Korea, Germany, New Zealand (among others) proved successful strategy.

Unfortunately seen sufficiently wide spread adoption masks social distancing states reopened early never locked begin with. Hence current surges. Musk already shorted planet earth Oh okay. Yeah definitely. misunderstood comment. ?? rule normal since months wtf  BULLSHIT! gotta stand line enter got damn store shit! FUGGIN RUBBISH! Good guy gangsters. get justice U.S.? that's gray area thats deciding care safety lmao. That's something remotely proud happy about.  thanks joined CDC apparently won‚Äôt it, they‚Äôll leave out.

This possible, acceptable, **vast** majority country, including Congress. ooh link face guard? Haha look first comment saddened masks things became political issue.

We've already tried War Drugs War Terrorism, time War Reality, outright deny basic truths met cheering clapping people opposed wear fucking seatbelt?
I'm sure I'd care either way. Also, make better use defense production act produce testing kits, ventilators, PPE, etc. 

Work putting American's back work government supported contact tracing program. Might little late point contact tracing, areas cases lower, might helpful. No, really say that? problem people use turn signal drive insurance generally considered dicks. There's expectation society make effort avoid harming others. Wearing mask different seems way everything. Everyone afraid say ""wear masks"" say ""wear masks indoors difficult maintain distance"". instead ""wash sanitize hands regularly"", ""wash hands, unless can't sanitize"". people making judgment calls often saying ""fuck it, anything"" (is Home Depot really busy today? stay 6' away everyone morning? Eh, fuck it, I'll take chances.) instead *doing*. bruh walmart already shit show horrible reputation trashiness fights March 17th got sick April 3rd, place Wal Mart twice. Sucks unlucky person beats odds wrong way lol. Lol top story site poll showing Trump double digits Pennsylvania actually GOOD thing Trump. secret voters something. extremely

Did right? welcome. Though choice I'd home.  Cue people never went college educating us engineering isn‚Äôt science. God great sense humor. fed anybody, make give away 90 fabric masks free masks could found stores. wish could helped more, I'm happy able help could. know companies owned coal miners homes miners debt companies. thing lot factory workers back then, companies owned houses pay anything. I'm frustrated wonky liberals focus ""opening up"" flagship state universities magnet/screener schools.

Motherfucker, people leaves behind? OK richest country earth ""good"" schools ""bad"" schools? fund focus education properly like Finland matter neighborhood living in, school actually worth shit? Typhoid Marys Excuse enraged thousands he‚Äôs killed without sense responsibility leadership.

Regardless, hope you‚Äôll pass similar message DeSantis me. 

Have good day. Walmart?! masks people going lose shit. Someone's going drive truck store waving Confederate flag screaming, ""this ain't communist China! ain't communist China!!!!""

These videos going gold. Italian here, someone genuinely explain keep seeing headlines: ‚Äúhospitals collapsing‚Äù, ‚Äúdead bodies everywhere‚Äù etc, look mortality states, it‚Äôs much lower everywhere else? mean, headlines deaths 10 times higher. MAGA hats stop buying literally everything promoted liberal/leftist got downvoted reason right. wait test ass leave home. law said could wear mask, people would screaming privacy invaded assumes people shopping Walmart read signs. fair, however, even two happen still neither worth risks. protests stupid. support everyone bored lockdown authority figures promoting this. Armchair scientist here. imagine many normal barriers new medications/treatments lowered. would ballpark 3 months human trials. Especially initial results promising. Absolutely. Especially Home Depot. know customers are. ""Gov. Stitt said news conference plan issuing statewide mask mandate. said different communities across state different needs."" Thats left. think may need broaden breadth employee experiences call outlier. know many people many different companies similar situations me. 

People area still belief it‚Äôs flu/is entirely fake/the deaths lie/etc. crazies ones making decisions, don‚Äôt care many people get sick, actually affects bottom line. Yeah east coast thinking like new york state others bad wouldn‚Äôt say we‚Äôre unified, we‚Äôre mostly ok, response varies lot state.

I‚Äôm Dgo, we‚Äôve never real lockdown, people streets nothing happening, I‚Äôve plenty customers refuse wear mask, hardly use correctly (luckily almost direct interaction them)

Walmart, Elektra, many businesses closed multiple occasions refuse comply social distancing face mask usage.

On hand, family Sinaloa lockdown nearly 4 months. Hold up, weren‚Äôt?

Where live, Walmart deployed retail equivalent standing army enforce mask policies. guys ridiculous. crazy enough think Biden win. think got medical degree place friends Facebook South got it. Testing keep getting it. JFC. need prevent spread, go, ""yep. gots it."" Peter Navarro ignored! eliminated positions years ago. worse March! Nice 4 months pandemic  infected touch anything (on body) damn well please.

Until go touch something germed hands someone else come along touch you.

Please decontaminate hands touching mask, like decontaminate hands touching it.

Edit: regret trying help you. risks come volunteering test vaccine? I'm seriously thinking signing get constant anxiety I'll come contact virus. good luck that.....

seriously. lol  friend fled Colombia 1980s drug cartels killed half family opposing political party.

This something lauded, desired endorsed regardless poorly elected governments handling virus. bad states lacked common sense issues. Connecticut maximum 4 day waits. average wait 2 days. Walmart small town still does. That's vape lysol (please vape lysol) I've thought it. We've lots complaints new policy county's social media pages. people making complaints generally fit certain demographic...

Edit: I'm going call People Walmart demographic. Yes, called joke, 200+ people got far flew head Also Parker, would say solid 80% wearing stores, probably less outside, people wearing one voluntarily I've seen. Yep trying catch Ridin Dirty mean I'm racist im terrified super huge black guys. seen huge get? impressive. Ive worked life never swole.

E: terrified wrong word maybe, impressed bulky muscles probably along line trying say need wear body cam, rich footage alone already see whole ""Woman/Man screams Walmart Employee letting her/him shop without mask"" posts. going rain lot internet points next days. Congress act:

Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, United States Constitution grants Congress enumerated power ""To promote progress science useful arts, securing limited times authors inventors exclusive right respective writings discoveries.""

-Bill far stupid arrogant self aware. Objective self criticism hurts feelings! walmart knows shops stores. waited till latest possible time reason. us quarantine even mandated wearing masks consistently.

But whole lot stupid people among us. assume virus hoax used plot people gain political leverage. 

Some us trying hardest, virus keeps spreading efforts made null people like this:  Heard. Thank you! says lot someone Supreme Court assault allegations, financial shadiness, buttloads boofing. That's good customers. would say employees too, every time go walmart cant find single employee working make serviceable face shields gallon water jugs. rain mean safe thing. COVID19 stay air 16 hours, scale air turbulence generate temporary upward thrust onto vector. also stops touching face much. queue stream Karen related videos. nah unlikely max 80k There‚Äôs already bunch people refuse wear masks smaller businesses. yeah they‚Äôre definitely gonna rough week trying get rid everyone don‚Äôt wear masks also go Walmart Please sign petition continue reporting coronavirus data CDC instead Trump administration: http://chng.it/jNHqgT5L9T local Kroger require masks. They've actually taken less precautions Walmart far. Walmart roped entrances help split people put social distancing stickers everywhere Kroger done anything see besides provide spray cart. I'm hoping Walmart requiring masks push edge make mandatory well. Kroger starts suddenly getting Walmart's customers, normal customers gonna happy lol  Lol what? Dude inserted conversation angry bat also failed read comment. I‚Äôm glad won‚Äôt responding you‚Äôve added nothing value conversation. Seriously, look yoga. You‚Äôll feel better things. first study. fact, study all. another bullshit article word ""could"" it. article says ""could"" cause B, study ""suggests"" pure crap. offense OP, I'm sick insinuation, speculation, absolutely substance behind it.  Well you‚Äôre selfish cunt. Honestly, amount people dying still people like there. NP! Glad help. FWIW, focus topic video. Look interviewer's technique. trigger happy tool empty clip citizens ? appreciate patience expertise applied moderation sub.

Thank you! Nope, enclosed area! Unless cars go them, go get burger. Yeah that's said wonder could create kind bubble northern states bad   67 tested roughly 48%. confirmed asymptomatic. Add list studies showing successful masks are. resident disgusted scared. best mental health, panic rising, like taste back throat. 

To anyone reading this: come vacation. come conventions, conferences, theme parks, beaches, whatever. safety, stay far far away don‚Äôt accept visitors homes either! Tbh ban took long enough.  Statue Liberty involves extremely crowded security lines, lines boats, crowded boats. Ellis Island mostly indoors. requiring masks boats. It‚Äôs fucking petri dish. wife took cashier job Walmart beginning April ONE would work there. wearing mask, glove, temperature taken every day. Staggered hours can't plan much anything. guard front store one inside store. one outside stops anyone without mask. one inside making sure see take mask off. Oh, live FLA crazies roam virus rules. walmarts already policy since covid started. walmart theres guy standing front door let wearing mask  dont understand became thing RIGHT NOW. Masks worn hundred years, noone medical community bitched Co2 stuff. Crocs shoelaces Maybe...end month fiiiine.

Or three months ago, whatevs.  Hear evil, see evil, speak evil, covid problem solved Tennessee! Better put big order refrigerated truck trailers Gov Florida, Texas Arizona snap up!  wife's school taught Spring using virtual learning. they're expected in-class school. expected get paid minimally front line babysitter. She'll spending time telling kids put masks back social distance. Good luck teaching lessons. education primary motivation opening schools, they'd virtually.

Also, I'm tired hearing schools need open children abused home. wife I, baby, put great risk assholes like hit kids? joke real?? There's many anti-mask shoppers? People going flipping like IHOP flapjacks.  ditto! Someone made website track it: http://canwereopen.com/data_numeric.html Dude aren‚Äôt hiring nobody. Us ‚Äúhealth ambassadors‚Äù regular ass employees black shirt little training de-escalate angry customer. Stay lane Navarro. enough problems regarding trade China. Clean mess. intelligent person attack someone better job yours. aunt reminds mine. Almost hope gets shut ass probably divide 20 25. 

Right 139,000 deaths 3.5 million positive tests = 3.9% case fatality rate. 

However, people die instantly testing positive. might take week two. current death count related positive test count two weeks ago (2.75 million). that's closer 5% (or 1 20). Wishing people would die prematurely profit, steal. thought mother pandemics black death... also meth labs in... Well, name location. Oh, lazy went numbers sequence, 11, 22, 33, 44 etc. taken. tried 111, 222, 333 etc. Finally 4 digits. surprisingly 1234 taken, 1111, 2222, 3333 etc. Honestly would preferred 3, 7 8. 3 lucky number Celtic mythology, 7 lucky Christians (7th Heaven) 8 means luck / prosperity Chinese.  component boils supply chain capacity.

There constraints every level, availability testing swabs storage/transport medium samples, reagents used processing samples, limit machines capacity run tests. read recently one major testing labs backlog 70k tests waiting processed. collecting 20k samples/day capacity process 15k samples/day things backup results delayed.

More testing capacity supposed coming online soon, new testing methods approved well help timely processing reporting results.

Edit add: [here another post documents source growing backlog pending tests. I‚Äôm finding saw 71k number, shows growth backlog 52k 63k 4 days. Walmart employee here. one way aisles told somebody going wrong way, literally told ""shut fuck up""(she Walmart employee well, shopping) Rollback 19 years ago: ""Fuck you, wear yellow ribbon! Support troops! Remember 9/11!""

Today, 9/11 death toll every day: ""Fuck you, ain't wearing mask! right!!"" People find exorbitant hospital bills, massive laid off, massive eviction, massive unemployment...but hey stock market stable. Things good right? what? Contrast Portland, Oregon.

If without mask public, gets instantly noticed. Stores strict, offer free curbside contactless pickup. governor introduced ban gatherings indoors 10 people. Testing (in experience) free result hour. Many, many people working home still, many, many activities events suspended, canceled, delayed, heavily modified social distancing.

Take look /r/Portland see treating this. Obviously everybody fully compliant, overall vibe one great concern willingness takes.

The West Coast general taken seriously, despite flareups, done okay. matter, though, isolated rest country. choad eastern Oregon can, time wants, fly family Phoenix visit grandma. comes back, family spend next week merrily infecting everybody hometown, goes Oregon's hard work window.

It's quite like that, get point. long strict isolation quarantining like South Korea New Zealand implemented, hot spots continue blast rest country virus. certainly able reopen safely viral threat neutralized throughout country one way another. I'm sure Wuhan *The deaths unmasked ones might make examine stance!* Legitimately, bravo. Youre exemption rule, good you. perfect example backwards mentality poor is. said yourself, didnt bad people, absolute tragedy. genuinely hope hold alot pride deserve lucky enough reach point. long-term effects broad based studies find negative side effects suffer them. always side effects always adverse reactions things nature. mean doing. one necessity mother invention situations need whats best now.  work Walmart refuse wear mask? fuck wrong you? Meaningless unless enforced 1.5 billion people earth 100 years ago? 100 years went 1. 5 7 billion? think that's even bigger concern covid itself. want accessible birth control everyone? anti-vaxxer overall. got three vaccines month ago.

I totally agree, using conflict interest claim vaccines bad wrong. 

But glossing massive act cronyism one particular instance Covid-19 stakes high disservice. ever, important process squeaky clean. People going go nuts. can‚Äôt wait videos.  Remember Ned stark meme back 2012?

Brace yourselves, Karen wave coming Wow, used follow guy's blog stuff years ago. Weird interesting see posted here. careful words don‚Äôt know meaning bit Fuck yeah woo! Exactly. closed next year. Sweden testing infrastructure shit beginning, point book test, get tested get answer within 1 two days. dont think exceptionally good anything. even could figure out, cant US?

To show shit testing was, health authorities looking repeal current testing regulation revamp hasnt updated decades hindrance help currentnsituation. taught ""nothing brute competition"" live guilt; understand thing. kids got vaccines today. Please take precautions necessary keep date. Sorry already posted. long think gas station anywhere country would last policy? everyone COVID respirator, always selfie? Something odd imo.

Some need scale back bit,, think family completely disown that, start family. reckless, yes. young folks make mistakes time, sometimes bad mistakes. 
And remember, 21, 21, restricted anything, could go bars/clubs/parties worry, hard know young adults taking this. seems difficult teen/young adult right living restrictions age...and age freely enjoying socializing wanted. Im 100% sure intention infect family wanted good time friends (like 21yos do), make ok went shit happens. one wanted virus happen let break family, well.... maybe shitty family. even know type causes heightened risk death. Probably. remember risk infection type blood like +50% compared type B (or something similar). guess question is, water wet? Like, define oil covered oil? Technically individual molecule surrounded molecules itself, molecule claim possess characteristic ""wet"" ""oily"" molecule possesses characteristic? huh? would Canadian Trucker American? let alone coastal elite LOL It'd nice staff wears covering nose mouth? think understand masks work.  European, I‚Äôm sure last months really changed ‚Äòworld‚Äôs view‚Äô US.

I mean, country clearly divided large component voted orange baboon still support 3 years every day ridiculous previous one... city genuine mask enforcement yet.(central Canada panic), today first time I'd seen everyone bus wearing masks, bit shocking seeing people stupid. We're pretty well, State Rep Darren Bailey Clay County successfully lawsuit declared stay-at-home order illegal, explode cases, may able shut Bailey's selfishness. appealed State Courts north there's loonies everywhere. idea we're gonna keep keepin rate, we're gonna get fucked out-of-state vacationers. Didn‚Äôt hospital Florida lie numbers recently?  Protests stupid hands down. I'm India dude. place people like call shithole(it's btw). I'm glad people took social distancing seriously. dense population, take control, we'd get absolutely massacred.

But pook yourselves, best country world, Murica, best minds world making joke themselves. get it, get BLM protests. man colour, know racism shitty many levels experienced it.

But one moment think protests right, fool like republicans closing mind believe things want to. Yeah, riots mass protests, zero adherence social distancing complete right? That's stupid.

At least learnt watching videos online. reality might different. I'm open corrected. LOL SAID YES INSTEAD ANSWERING üòÇüòÇüòÇ donate blood red cross find also positive antibodies.

I *believe* positive antibodies, window time infect passed would symptoms already, going to. would look Etsy masks cover beards. Everything done meaningful. it. people helping would never evict family street. That's paper-pusher far-away bank, know paid care. 

Reach them, too! Tell trouble, would appreciate help could spared. might get much moral support - hard times. mean something, no? might surprised, too... 

Again, many hugs - Internet hugs. type person worthy part community. live society takes giant dump right now. times pass. believe people love take care last laugh. Keeping thoughts, long shot come you.  They've required months, enforce asking people mask front. say ""I medical condition"" take mask soon enter store. People don‚Äôt ask scientific evidence eating food, yet wearing masks. it‚Äôs science all. excuses. accept science Darwin facemasks. guy.....  Yup that's fair power positive thinking. It‚Äôs important believe things ok. Massachusetts laid ran people trace Cool. mean it‚Äôs 4 months late, cool. would person goes walmart. least Russia China admit communist country post 3 months ago i‚Äôm gonna alt f4 Every store absolutely rights deny you. Enjoy making scene like Karen way though. tell store mask trespassing call cops, press charges actually way interesting. PAPR plus protecting eyes keeping touching face. I'd probably get one look unwieldy kind legit third party testing documentation. I'll stick low-key elastomeric respirator now. That's great. find Asmonbald thinks? Exactly, especially since current administration represents ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù faction business world. if, say gas station small town said sell black people? pharmacy town? Hope another one gets built? That's right everyone lies, tie line. Get real nation wide mask mandate would good start. Even can't strictly enforced would show solidarity believes virus believes intelligent measures prevent it. countless morons believe masks make sick Covid hoax direct result trump's bullshit.  going hire people specifically position tell people wear masks. hope duty cops. They're called health advocate junk. walmart creating policy isnt going shit slow covid mortality rate. going create viral videos people freaking cause put mask. Security won‚Äôt enough. They‚Äôll need national guard keep anti-maskers check Whatever door greeters get paid there, enough shit storm they're going put with. go Walmart time. one bothers me. governor already wimped decision gave county mayors health department. counties already mask protocols place. Yep, shit. good no-one seems disagree emphasis saving lives.  ""Private employers fewer 500 employees"" there's kicker. Um, yeah, actually. inability write correct English would demonstrate pretty well. 

Anything else? local Walmart target Fresno mask required signs.. expected people disregard employees say ""you wear mask come in"" ""wear"" mask around face get pull chin soon get straight take off. probably applies OCare plans. Likely apply corporate independent plans. course OCare plan costs three times much.

I also got rebates Insurance OCare enacted after. guess 'additional' services somehow magically ate extra revenues planned. MRI machines expensive. Please translate comment. saying ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù to? Climate change coronavirus two topics Indian government taken seriously. want get intricacies given 'right wing' label, two topics government polar opposite bolsonaro's trump's govt. medical professionals, years training, tight group gathered around patient table.

Then stop acting like ones feigned moral/intellectual superiority. realize people generations ones don‚Äôt believe science vote politicians allowed happen Lol they‚Äôll busy trying pray away people wearing reusable cloth masks. think saw 4-5 people wearing disposable face masks went grocery shopping yesterday. 
Hopefully recycling process something masks believe you‚Äôre right. adversary, I‚Äôd delighted spend pennies bots troll farms spreading mask disinformation get massive destabilization US return. 

I also believe that‚Äôs part Trump refuses take action it. obviously aware financial issues cause many, among issues. family kids suffering many ways issues caused schools reopening normally. Ok mask police. Millennials (like me) vote larger numbers usual. time entire future hinges voting, still care Kanye whatever vote larger numbers. Indiana school teach begins August 10th (teachers Aug 6). stay fuck store. Problem solved. oxford vaccine already almost billion doses order, 400 million EU 300 million US alone, they're waiting approval start production wonder teachers also high priority list considering stranglehold school system becoming propose get back normal? Yeah, Swedish people try invade denmark constantly place beer front invasion falls apart. please go back 24 hours... miss going Walmart random shit 3am... sounds like something movie. representative wordlessly told safety priority... That's enough reason sign anything understand upset given choice? seems like perfect solution... becoming adult. Life full difficult choices someone always hold hand guide it.  People put mask already know affect ability breathe. people making claims even put mask find argument fabricated. Vent politicians support make clear intentionally donating Campaigns competitors. I‚Äôm understanding this. It‚Äôs free all. It‚Äôs college listening demand offering options students. One one lab use, even classes 10 less pose small risk. one better policies opinion. Allow students choose feel comfortable doing. PA government something use report them. link interested:

 afraid going wait January 20 federal government start taking steps protect people COVID-19.

The federal government right busy protecting us windmill cancer. Yep.   
Each state sets thier guidelines (usually enforced).    
And local areas proudly ignore them. Ughhh /facepalm I‚Äôm student rotations hospital lab Kansas City there‚Äôs notable increase hospitalizations since July 1st. People Missouri aren‚Äôt smart Jeez, 14 weeks? Feels lot longer Yep. Six physicians social circle pay cut (ranging 15% - 40%) they‚Äôre still working day day front lines (anesthesia, intensivists ER) Yeah, feel. Right I‚Äôm trying decide whether go best friends baby shower mid-August. It‚Äôs question entirely local COVID-19 cases low locally definitely keeping eye hopefully 4th July cases come new cases start decrease. 

And personal risk minimal one good friends also ended hospital weeks oxygen months, comorbidities, like know risk level great indicator.. Healthcare provided government everyone buys profit  Canadian here. live near border visited states number times year life. sucks border closed situation frightening heck. I'm definitely voter keeping shut. conservatives liars. 

They obviously rich varied lives varied interests. rabidly vote GOP matter what: abortion, guns, white supremacy, taxes. 

They LIE care country care one (or more) 4 issues. 

The conservative right still supports Trump 90% despite blatantly pardoning buddy - yet lie caring law order. 

Conservatives lie. them. 
Liberals lie too. them. feel bad guys. underpaid CERTAINLY paid well enough put position tell hostile random person mask up. job left store management security something. Los Angeles took two weeks friend get results came back positive.... probably doesn‚Äôt anymore considering took two weeks, still can‚Äôt go back work tests negative.  You‚Äôre way harsh. Season 7 still great. Close damn gyms virus maintaining lethality, infectious?

So evolving damned bast\*rd. mandatory get way stronger treatment order take all.

Meanwhile better keep using face mask order avoid extend virus. Pennsylvania No, I'm going actual death count numbers. listed amount deaths per age group far Covid influenza well. right time. Continuity process consistent data reliable form interrupted reckless. change desired, methods run tandem comparison accuracy test period. Good luck Walmart. fucking flat earthers gaf infect. None third grade brained nitwits handle psychological trauma admitting wrong virus causes. Make store called Covid R Us thats automated employees let shop there. burdrn rest world stupidity. Moderna good company. Watch this! [Moderna virus eradicated, life back normal 100 percent -- mostly -- it, we'll get partial picture. collect info? hope states keep top particulars, communicate directly respective publics. Ah, little *tasp√©* still *grippita*. 

We'll see week two. age spin yeah first role [disaster psychology](http://www.disastermh.nebraska.edu/files/recovery/2014/Stages%20of%20Disaster%20NE%20Strong%20Flyer_English.pdf) severely underrated US response pandemic.  disaster certainly recognize phases.

They're evident story -- mask wearing decline second wave drop ""patriotic fervor,"" Americans moved disillusionment phase disaster going comply much anything.

Unless made one sheet gauze, chintz lace, transparent material, mask *somewhat* effective Coronavirus filter better none. Anything blocks one clearly visible globule spit hitting lips *help*. question becomes ""how effective it?"".

Before even start that, using wrong mask help. touch outside mask rub eye, might well wearing one. going infect soon come within range someone contagious, today go store. Likewise even wearing N95 P99 mask,.you still expose yourself.

That said, nonwoven better woven, knits almost worthless.

The nonwoven artificial fiber N95 KN95 masks use electrostatic filtration. screen like would use screen rocks sand yard. air moving past electrically resistive fibers creates statoelectric charge magnetically attracts finer particles. finer particle affected, way sub micron level. course give protection visible globules spit. engineered level physics goes beyond filtration screen door. would expect technology protects people work Coronavirus patients day every day without becoming exposed themselves.

Valve masks protect inhale sacrifice protection people around ease exhalations. also prolong durability mask electrostatic filtration work filter wet. Also, filters accumulate dust humidity lose effectiveness time drying sterilizing heat works 20 times, forever.

Now recommendation: BS. KN95 masks (without valves) properly fit available. work. expensive. competition discover poor mask get away with. Buy KN95 mask fits wear every occasion presence another breathing human live you, time enter enclosed space human *might last day*. Especially enclosed spaces, avoid situation much can. Wherever possible, maintain two meters space breathing humans even masked outdoors. Change mask frequently dehydration sterilization, discard useful life. everyone this, outbreak end three weeks. control people must keep ritual protect others reach necessary level pain become compliant necessary prevention.

That said infection fatality rate children &lt;14 years low. 

The UK found infection fatality rate less 0.0012% (1 83,333 infections) &lt;14 years. rigorous antibody testing using ELISA, found 6.8% England caught virus. UK found overall IFR 1.1% ages, higher estimates, might overestimated risk children.

Even strict unrealistic assumptions, CFR 18-34 would 0.1-0.2%. obvious fix dont know tell you. control information, place stored, access it, control information released. think fact ability recognize ""aren't intelligent"" default experts needed puts group ""intelligent people social distance"". make damn call Mr. President. ........ Oh tough One Canadian citizen. kids asthma, would going anywhere even slightly crowded. judging, opinion. wait out?? well~ Thought Onion article first obvious! Stretching deaths hospitalizations longer time overwhelm healthcare system once.***

You ignoring fact state had/has different strategies timelines shutting down/reopening. states currently seeing healthcare systems become overwhelmed leadership ignoring even continue ignore recommendations preventing community spread. New York situation mayor NYC governor New York page regarding shutdown shut week two late - saw happened there. states currently seeing high positivity rates exact opposite New York similar stages, it‚Äôs state leadership.

I lucky live Illinois governor Illinois mayor Chicago page, haven‚Äôt order refrigerated trucks handle morgues capacity. positivity rate around 4% Chicago 7% Illinois last time checked, doesn‚Äôt seem rising exponentially every 2.6 days, governor still proactive transparent another shutdown possibly coming.
Miami-Dade county Florida hand recently positivitity rate 33%. want say New York City 22 25 percent first shut down, late point. eventually rose 77% think highest, everything shut already (So would people infected two weeks prior). haven‚Äôt heard anything Florida leadership discussing shutdown - fact opposite what‚Äôs happening.

I feel really lucky live Illinois leadership sees problem proactive. Yes PPE shortages, yes things rough never capacity, got benefit reduced community spread. Imagine effect hospitals shut schools people didn‚Äôt start working home two three week later... all.

**The ball roll, people work together stop rolling fast smashes whatever wall bottom, locking down/masks/social distancing meant do, effectively done.**

Edit: Spelling. Also excuse 2-second memory lemming self numbers aren‚Äôt exactly right, relying memory lazy cite them. Typical American, right?

There‚Äôs reason TN‚Äôs hospitalization starting soar nothing done: governor basically said today even considering rolling back previous opening phases cases hospitalizations increase- create hospital space. It‚Äôs dangerous game playing lives. Apparently 3300+ increase yesterday, topping last week‚Äôs pandemic-wide record 2400, enough make reconsider plan. actually said 9+% positivity rate stable, month ago 3-4%.

He also said doesn‚Äôt feel statewide mask mandate would beneficial allowing mayors decide concerning masks, ‚Äútargeted approach‚Äù. don‚Äôt even know make sense logic. People cross county lines avoid wearing mask. would seem carry weight came top. 

Oh goal state many kids physically school possible two weeks.

Interesting, good know. appreciate scientifically studied source.

Yeah, that's basically makes N95 effective, seal face leakage around sides. Although taught facial hair no-go properly seal, even rubber adaptation, people wear properly. Also, important remove mask certain manner, avoid getting moist.

So, site good info, frankly think beyond reach public, particularly trouble even basic mask wearing. maybe wrong. Hopefully wrong. would prefer everyone N95 even KN95 find trusted sources, hope idea catches least certain circles exposure.

But thank sharing. I'm passing along friends field. mask wearing resident AZ confirm state full selfish idiots don‚Äôt wear masks. ugly cunt. STOP politicising GODDAMN PANDEMIC entire time.

If true , Southern parts USA would virus say fatalities undercounted half (there‚Äôs evidence far off), half new cases 18-34 group (based past numbers would like 1/3) exclude cases last two weeks death lag (which good fair point).  strict unrealistic assumptions, CFR 18-34 would 0.1-0.2%.

We exclude cases least last 4 weeks. CDC estimates 21 days average case, longer 18-34 years old. final IFR would 1 age group, would concur (I think 18-34 1% IFR). that's still massive number. age group, airborne pathogen give close high IFR. Even works ages 18-55 would make much harder virus spread effectively.

Sure, it'd better safe effective everyone, vaccin 18-55 would really slow spread down.

That's right, took time review literature, data previous SARS Coronaviruses, well diseases like influenza, suggest community masking little effect large-scale propagation (the ""R-value""; confused individual masking single component robust sanitization process e.g. hospital setting).

Community masking seems radically different unexpected effect SARS-Cov-2 SARS-Cov-1 major contagion like it. unemployed bar owners start bar fights. Top 10% draws issue away real issue top 1% something like 90% wealth US. means top 10% 2% actually hold less percentage would expect children positivity rate 31%, rate entire population 11%.

That's said, none real.

They said kids tested, 1/3 positive. since kids high risk, they're probably tested symptoms. mean 1/3 population children state.And 11% entire population infected, close high. New York state around 5%. US stopped issuing passports except life-and-death emergencies reminded me. Might wait another week.

All kidding aside, gentleman's son may 18, sound like son still living home, 18-year-olds still do. So... parents' rules then. 

Still, shitty situation parents in. (The son, too.) want kids smart enough make good decisions instead pull rank them. I'd say here, though, parents would wise pull rank that's takes. *Whatever* takes, really. can't undo kinds permanent damage virus cause, there's good reason anyone voluntarily play Coronavirus Reverse Lottery. Yes. 

Do want family making decisions case incapacitated want hospital? 

Do want family immediate authority executors estate (incl body) want fight extensive red tape?

thats fucking bullshit.

Hogan strongarmed Baltimore re-opening. ready indoor seating without masks cases going 6.23 percent positive testing daily 5 percent week ago.

That's suggesting think reopen. WAY reopen schools without putting people significant danger affecting bulk society.


We going suffering repercussions generations come, including children. that, angry ""leaders"" failed get control instead saying chunk population die suffer kids need socialization.


It suck children, remember suffering right hands idiots. Lets prolong it. this. true introvert wife is, extrovert least introvert like starting go stir crazy. I'm working home I've never happier lol Yeah that‚Äôs unrealistic dream we, apparently. sad thing mask doesn‚Äôt stop getting it. actually stops giving that‚Äôs really shitty. hospitals private? can't still report CDC without Trump's ok? 139,000 Americans dead... Quite harmless indeed.  ...uhh, article, though. 20% (in tiny trial, btw) ""severe"" side half got middle three doses suffered mild moderate fatigue, chills, headache muscle pain. Also, 40% people middle-dose group experienced fever second vaccination. 

Three 14 patients given highest dose experienced severe side effects, dose used larger trials.

So... lets give 5 billions people....1.25 BILLION people would **""severe""** side effects. 

Yes, ""high"" dose catastrophic. hope Trump fires Biden announces Fauci pick VP. ton compromise jesus [Translation today's deaths included 4 months old girl.

Darn misunderstood part saying ""kids symptomatic time"" ""kids symptomatic covid-19""; meant kids often running nose something else allowed attend school - even though running nose covid-19 symptom. sources say parents forced send kids symptoms school know sure schools sending kids back immediately parents told authorities send them. Linking Facebook group called ""Save Sweden Covid19"" really source claim. 

Also yes, small outbreaks might happen - obviously happening outside schools many countries too. However, fact Sweden close primary schools yet higher incidence sick teachers sick support staff sick kids seen.

enjoy substandard medical care Waiting November seems like lose lose point.

Trump plans censor COVID-19 data. needs fired immediately. handle incompetence, actively attacking medical science data middle fucking pandemic absolutely unacceptable. Yep, find JUCO nearest public college want go likely direct path too. Gen Ed stuff worth expense generally plus experience lot parties, sporting events (post Corona) general socializing goes regular university. I'm willing bet money NY NJ see cases rise offices reopen. silent spreader every country Earth caught right while, area news stations show photos video beaches parks. Never offices open managers feel need look employees shoulders.

If offices mostly reopen time schools, it'll 100% blamed schools calls offices close time. Making things even difficult parents. Yeah, hit hard took us surprise. two weeks I‚Äôd put money numbers across country slowly start creep towards ours. shit together states getting hit hard end sight Going need source this, can't real... One Canadian (says here) Average hospitalization cost COVID case $73k, gets paid feds, afterwards people survive. 

It's good start evil plan, needs cost effective. I'm hoping five years, people look back this, recoil horror start dialog around shit went wrong many American casualties. Thank you. read article linked here, wondering you‚Äôd seen there. 

Always appreciate info!  laughed hard comment CT got hit everyone ran away NY summer homes bringing shit there. compassion wish great harm upon someone. compassion man whos life went wrong killed man mask attempted kill police officer, time think punished death suitable punishment.

Death-Sentence

I'm totally stealing this. Awesome. 97% match sent Wuhan lab US last year, Batwoman confirmed. possible got testing animals supposdely people working lab caught selling live animals markets used testing make extra coin. maybe options table stage. must sooo much fun work someone thinks absolute *genius* inventor insists micromanaging controlling technical minutae, basically incapable considering viewpoints, deferring experts, admitting wrong, feels strongly someone.  RemindMe! 8 weeks I'm fairly certain *are* performed villain. Yet still lockdown. Face reality Especially gets even greater popular vote deficit... live east coast Everyone see public isint jogging taking walk masks, except outside dining that‚Äôs given states suffering mask issues? Trump order hospitals anything? government employees facilities. KC Mo here. yep masks EVERYWHERE. bad wasn‚Äôt Jaguar. caiman. strongly encourage masks, deceptive articles harms credibility actually promoting mask usage. Right. like needed 15 days lockdown stop spread four months ago.  Tell Trump get military beat shit everyone wearing masks? China put asymptomatic cases another column table sub loses mind scream ""cover up!!1!!1""

Imagine China Trump admin now. never happen going send every American type masks medically purposed? No. Three hundred twenty million people US get masks he's full absolute garbage account. 

Your bandannas, crocheted masks, cloth mask, regular paper/surgical mask shit prevent liquid directly accessing another body. 

What farce. psychological placebo used make feel safer hopeful best worst political ploy. UGA, checks out.  Honestly, combination race *and* poverty. 

If turns people vitamin deficiencies worse outcomes covid, would make sense people darker skin, harder time synthesizing vitamin D, would worse outcomes.

Combine worse Healthcare options, lack insurance bad things come poverty, get perfect storm. Good enough me! ""Like miracle, disappear."" Bad decisions (working symptomatic) good outcomes luck, indicator repeating event. Furthermore, article says half people tested, close contacts stylists became infected.

Misleading title best See, things like keep night.  


 
I hope happy!   /s Read article posted. Kinda rails point. Ironic bunch mayor's there. ill informed? 

Also, stalking me? seems virus seems fizzle (for one reason another) 20% population gets infected.

We 1%. realistically vaccine then. wait winter..... superpower. He‚Äôs already threatened defund us would surprised lol ""The eight deaths Canyon Creek make almost 25% state's death toll 60% county death toll.

Koelsch Senior Communities runs 35 facilities eight states across country,¬†according website.""  I'm ready dose now!  Bolsanaro still insisting big deal? 

I even think catching COVID deter üòñ So... gonna happen? Try optimistic... CDC charge numbers anyway. CDCs case numbers couple hundred thousand lower already, deaths lower 4 thousand. 

The media reports numbers Johns Hopkins, worldometer crawls individual municipalities numbers. try vrchat !! actually enforce tho?
Like hospital report covid numbers whoever hell want?

HHS CDC simultaneously?? That's could never enjoy show, I've lived it.  We‚Äôre gonna waiting long time keep screaming. Corrupt fuck... 

Vote! Percentages fractions. 5% means 5/100. 5 would numerator 100 denominator. 

When denominator 1, ignore it. 2/1 2. 

You divide numerator denominator number keep ratio them. 16/32 = 8/16 = 4/8 = 2/4 = 1/2. mean ""half"". 

You also multiply factor. 1/3 = 6/18. mean ""one third"". 

When multiply decimals, move decimal point. 1234,567 * 100 = 123456.7

Remember that, order keep ratio, need multiplication division numerator denominator. 

50% 50/100 5/10 0.5/1 0.5 (I divided 100). 

And 0.0065 = 0.0065/1 = 0.065/10 = 0.65/100 = 0.65% (I multiplied 100).

0.0065, without denominator, implies denominator 1. want get 100, percentage, numerator denominator must multiplied 100. Right? several shop masks rated higher N95 chemicals etc. clear look cooler so..... know, noticed someone else commented. opted edit because, frankly, like too. I‚Äôm quite sure you‚Äôre getting at. highest dose gives extremely severe side effects, won‚Äôt administer highest dose approved vaccine. Regardless, would take fever day prevent getting Covid. negative effects could take years show. wont see couple months. Liar, aint wearing mask üò§ knows CO2 poisoning. Sounds like current generation Floridians. Happy cake day! agree. 3 year old son autism wear mask whole time grocery store. wear mask without tantrum grown ass adults can't manage it? citizens responsible, laws must enacted.

These bar owners think exercising rights actually forcing government take away rights. 

A foundation democracy self-rule citizen. cannot rule (i.e., responsible), foundations democracy erode. guess figured people brought us Tide Pod Challenge would trouble pandemic. says, ‚ÄúI know. always best work. Ask anyone.‚Äù Here‚Äôs article nothing gain saying experiences people love call names insult say I‚Äôm scum rat whatever. Literally nothing gain think it‚Äôs fucked lied to. I‚Äôm telling anyone wear mask quarantine, wear mask obviously apocalyptic numbers starting sound real fuckin funny SICK PEOPLE AT. like shouldn‚Äôt dropping dead streets? fuck assumes vaccine approved next July. We'll probably one approved well (although distribution take time) course are. would infectious disease data go Centers Disease Control? Seems odd. SMH. course! bundle handouts 1% good economy. deficit used really benefit anyway? long term (let‚Äôs say year more) coronavirus immunity ever achieved? vaccine body‚Äôs immune systems? mean *any* coronavirus. Still rookie numbers compared FL... Good question, yes ethnic/racial component. People communities color disproportionately impacted this. 


  


This first many results find google ""covid 19 communities color"" everything goes plan. really believe start getting vaccine next summer. Developing huge hurdle think everyone forgets logistics required manufacture 7 BILLION doses. 

The flu vaccine nowhere near 7 billion doses manufacturing required pretty huge. 

I think read somewhere company trying max production glass vials vaccine storage know much take. ran production entire year, still wouldn‚Äôt produce enough glass vials. 

And that‚Äôs one component. still need grow/synthesize it. Package it. Inject it. Ship it. Track it. Etc etc. headline even real üò≥ Sounds like time stimulus checks beefy enough keep parent home homeschool kids. letter wrote &amp; **highly** recommend send politicians, minus references California unless live course: 

Dear [recipient], 

We need go long-term protection mode Californians uncontrollable COVID spread, NOW. 

I demand measures prevent Californians danger due COVID overwhelming hospitals: 

Mandate EVERY school state online-only school default entire 2020-21 school year, in-person classes outdoors, optional, fully-distanced, creditless, masks REQUIRED anyone comes onto campus. 
Convert physical campuses ‚ÄúDistance Education Help Centers‚Äù students use/pick school computers/tablets/wi-fi/hotspots work distanced others, pick free nutritious meals cleaners, use/pick school supplies, get PPE interact kids supervision, get in-person help eductors who‚Äôd volunteer come in. 

3) Pay every single Californian household enough one adult completely stay home homeschool children/pets household least June 2021-it would costly, inefficient, intrusive try confirm existence dependents households deploying funds, people funds, people pay keep wheels [] economy spinning tough time. 

Debt bedrock every proper capitalist society-and debt produced protecting [us] worst COVID economy‚Äôs cruelty would much smaller debt produced trying play catch-up/stop violent unrest massive economic apocalypse state. 

Sincerely, 

[you]  would ever think dance rally would way 'stand rights' midst pandemic..


I also stupid state defiance majority. getting droves travels idiocracy. Could ask little favor here?

Is post describing phase 1 phase 2? top says phase 1, bottom says phase 2, comments talking phase 3.

I'm issues here. blaming all, I'm one slow. get what's up. dont give shit anecdotal evidence Yep. serious, lot ppl experienced some...and early phases limited amt people. thousands really see any. short term. Long term knows?

I think Phase 3 months, wont pushing soon. safe?

Edit: I'm anti-vaxxer, I'm playing cautious side fence comes rushed vaccine. honest, feeling won‚Äôt learning lot year hand washing lessons multiple breaks due outbreak. hearing rumors though Abbott planning shutting (have friend works capitol) hopefully we‚Äôll hearing news soon. He‚Äôs wishy washy though idk.

Thank lesson ideas offer though, kind stranger! I‚Äôll keep mind. Stay safe! America country toddlers? 

Honestly, toddler throws fit dinner, give stops. longer screams, longer waits.

The longer people stomp feet longer goes. people gotten point first time would much better spot now. US then? They‚Äôre idiots! don‚Äôt understand it. Well, wasted six months thus far ""I know doctors!""

""These fancy doctors! know plenty know *everything*, they're GODDDDD even though might think they're God. They're human like me; could wrong &amp; could right""

""So I'm gonna go that! could right, DARE tell I'm wrong, F think are?"" No, Hogan got tired hearing whining crying privileged Karens wanting beer oysters Harbor said ""fine, reopen."" cases going up, he's polite say ""b***h told so."" Nice! lot smaller villages isolated enough virus never reached first place, partially due prevention efforts precisely wouldn‚Äôt capacity give adequate treatment spread community. soon cases identified, even 2 3, entire districts city streets got locked anyone came direct indirect contact got traced possibly quarantined well. think even northern villages quarantined entirely everything safely contained. kids, like kids general usually type gets annoyed people kids public places easily.

But damn, feel sorry right now. good solution lot problems involving kids days. Trying best understanding, gotta rough. Gotta Texas Death Step. popular country dance Texas moment. makes LOT sense me; thanks. much whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs weaker strain‚Äù line So, you‚Äôre saying desirable places live got hit first? 

Shocker. FAT CHANCE OLD MAN think there's education problem country?  Vaccines produce immune response last much longer far stronger one natural infection. Sarah Gilbert saying expect Oxford vaccine provide protection two years. might two options. false dilemma presents choice two mutually exclusive options, implying options. One option clearly worse other, making choice seem obvious. Also known either/or fallacy, false dilemmas type informal logical fallacy faulty argument used persuade audience agree. False dilemmas everywhere. deliberate accidental, goal make argument convincing. Masks really aren‚Äôt going get this, especially cloth masks people use. They‚Äôll stop getting deep are, idea people around parade actual solution. live popular state tourism takes pandemic seriously. Things quiet tourism-wise since March. Recently I've noticed number tourists slowing increasing, lot wearing masks. 

GO AWAY, fuck problem taking mask-less vacation right now?! Bash people Chinese conspiracy simultaneously supporting Russian conspiracy.
Brain dead understatement rights! /s Without closing state borders efforts naught... best worst parts moving US? I‚Äôm interested perspectives people grew recently (not 10+ years ago) moved away. Right sure feels like grass greener everywhere I‚Äôm sure great parts living US take granted don‚Äôt even notice you‚Äôre gone. one laughed headline like 3 whole minutes? People starting dying horribly winter that's what's going happen. Holy shit edited hell post. It‚Äôs emergency use Easy now. 45 subjects increased antibodies. Baby steps. Let‚Äôs see next 30,000 subjects get excited. Yes did. Placebo first time (Though everyone got losing dose) drug second time.

Halfway second trial made sign waivers thought might cause brain tumors. Fun times. You‚Äôre gonna stop Covid w/masks? Nice plan, except single person still 8 weeks it‚Äôs gonna spread again.

Is really best people come with? Apocalypse experts said world ended well twenty times now... basically US trying going again, entire World time. 
if cant reduce debts, beat crap owners party furious him... Severe influenza + covid could easily double current death toll Memo hospitals: ‚ÄúMake data public.‚Äù sure think I'm pro-school based comment? think terrible idea send kids back school right atrocious nothing done take care families stuck working outside home safe place kids. homeschooled happened I'm lucky enough go work gets home job. Otherwise would boat single essential workers two parent households can't alternating work schedules. saying answer leaving six year old alone 8 plus hours day. Again, heating premade meals concerns me. PS live IL, surprising states sort law this. bet something happened young child due unsupervised like state law parent would still investigated neglect though.  40% got fever mid dose. higher doses bunch sever side effects. 

The standard vaccine ""is bad covid"". worse vaccines far. Well damn...and sending kids back schools huh??

Note: literally mean ones tested positive - mean general b/c know cases missing. Imagine government allow online school. wouldn‚Äôt say we‚Äôd wear masks rest lives. I‚Äôd say likely majority people vaccinated that, it‚Äôs permanent vaccine, would like flu shot would learn live it. virus doesn‚Äôt mutate much (the flu,in comparison, mutates rapidly) would say virus would less eradicated mass vaccinations. I‚Äôm also scientist slightest really knows. want attend brothel, legal country (opened lockdown).... selfish? That's true well. assume enough people get vaccine. think that‚Äôs unlikely. People won‚Äôt even wear masks. plenty dumb people MA, worry. That's crushing counteroffensive! way. walking peak surge. think basically page here. details matter. 1 million gets side effect, that's going big deal. 40% get moderate side effect, maybe that's different story. 

The problem 40%. pretty large amount side effects. phase small sample size, maybe get better later, sell-off stock executives rejection normal governmental oversight make hopeful. to? Honest question see day number one network show called ‚Äúwhen asshole goes wrong‚Äù much angry kinda get it.

I never lost job (yet I‚Äôm worried) yet got 3000 check didn‚Äôt ask moths ago.

These folks close it‚Äôs fault. isn‚Äôt government helping business shut down? understand means? Maybe like 100 percent just... folks realize pour like slow creeping black plague... pity them.


The answer leave. standup.

It's America stand warning, rollout table like blueprint. cede ground much weaker catch-up you. Makes total sense. 20 years since science class shows. mean.. serious think still recruiting phase III live stateside entire planet

Actually borders closed Americans makes ok? can‚Äôt sell alcohol protest. TABC going shut now, hope worth top wants VP Kanye West 2020. 
These billionaires think everything joke whatever want. Key differences = wearing masks indoors.  I‚Äôve saying it‚Äôs regular, smart people aren‚Äôt convinced need socially distance, wear mask, stop various out-of-joke leisure activities. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre selfish can‚Äôt live without boozy brunch find mask annoying wear whatever. People selfish. Kinda, guess. Cases start spiking again, trending downward time, around June 14th. Coincidentally, around 14 days BLM protests started taking off. So, might bunch entitled kids. Although entitled kids wonder works people compromised immune systems. think can't get stupider. need Pat Sajak Alex Trebek make statement. mom, grandma, uncle bill, little Bobby can't get ICU bed...the average Joe see pandemic always been. Yes, could blinded changing data...but eyes opened reality reality. gonna make joke blue lack oxygen, tired stupidness. guess we'll never know Ok, thanks. think would many viable alternatives. caught guard though. Moderna‚Äôs producing robust antibody responses, don‚Äôt know effect durable yet.  cares. They'll infecting Rapid recovery? think they‚Äôre great - I‚Äôm glad know them. price paid. Cut one open found 5 layers. held water melted instead burned. signs point legit mask, certainly better homemade cloth mask I‚Äôve wearing. mean, depends state, results coming August, accepted september, know NY schools start mid September. extended family already knee deep existential crisis can't summer barbecues, I'm going make holidays without listening guilt trip presentations every week. see New Mexico. Stay strong (California) box cold, thermal conductivity (cardboard plastic) less ice feels less cold (what feel hand heat flow, temperature).
Same everything bathroom around 20C, tiles feel cold, towels not. Ahh!

 
So, that's 2,000 18. But, fittingly, low score wins. 
Is ANYONE administration embarrassed??? Yes - let‚Äôs forget, 2017 administration made experts stop using phrase ‚Äúevidence- based‚Äù ‚Äúscience-based‚Äù among others. begs question, long planning? Stay home there's vaccine least, cases control. stands, surrounding city school registering 100+ cases daily - seem like lot *but* good chunk positives probably faculty staff expected campus month.  trust Dr. Anthony Fauci President Donald Trump ANYDAY. Why?

Because Dr. Fauci medical degree years experience President Trump FAKE degree BOUGHT proven incompetence time time again.



Fauci's mistake claiming masks unnecessary that's nothing compared Trump. wearing mask since beginning knew helpful. Kick 4d3d3d3 soon anti maskers like ‚Äúwearing facial covering right!‚Äù read whole article. saw quote referenced &amp; noted Faici quoted right &amp; remarked reactions seemed acceptable.

I've observing many people going grocery store wearing masks last months. 

It's good now. Typically seen small percentage people masks, even weeks ago.

Today, everyone one on. saw one lady take mask soon got outside store, otherwise everyone mask on. Finally, three months late. This. live North Dakota accounts conservative state. said, I‚Äôve never seen many conservatives embarrassed sitting republican president. first time life truly ashamed president country. way let say, voting Trump year people crazy think Biden answer. way fix issues America purge(not kill) government officials(red blue) start fresh. Thinking career politician either side cares best interest American people joke. need younger people touch today‚Äôs issues come forward take active role leadership country. Might well saved breath. 
Those believe already board. 
Those aren‚Äôt board never gonna care CDC thinks. 

Until Garth Brooks Hamburglar McDonalds PSA encouraging masks, idiots going keep trying argue 20 year old baristas finding new pedophile conspiracies pin people don‚Äôt trust. ‚ÄúIt Jon Stewart using Spotify along Bezos! swear!‚Äù Redfield sure seems awful chatty lately.

He come long ways since smirking standing next Trump, lied us saying anyone get test.

He grown spine become unmuzzled. full investigation needs undertaken resigns shame (he admit anything course) lied us masks 4 months, also held basically press conferences pandemic destroying country watch. legit psychological sociological study individual group learning adapt seasons changing alters judgement adaptation general new need comes along? countries kinda handed China. need redundant... ‚Äúdeceptive articles‚Äù. recent comment saw summed well‚Äî headlines drive clicks, clicks drive revenue.  work supermarket US.

He lie - save lives. Grow fuck stop concern delete shit. idea your'e talking about.

Most comments fucking nerd.

How old you? little complicated that. sort retrospective study help decide research priorities. seems indicate drug might useful, research prioritized funded easily.  Or, visa versa.  virus mutates people spread different strains around everywhere.

Just immune one strain make immune thousands others. Important note US case rate Germany, we‚Äôd 1,000 cases per day. maybe great comparison. I‚Äôd vote caiman. meant epidemiologists pointing alarmist. Marc Lipstich instance. Hope learn hard way. people stay home would done April. purposefully making slow painful seemingly prolong it. Thank you! tired bull shit headlines clinical meat.  know. part reaction ridiculousness side effect listing ads labels. ""If allergic Drug, please take Drug. [duuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh] Patients taken Drug heart burn, nausea, diarrhea, allergies Drug."" phase three happen Thanksgiving? make ""don't take Drug allergic Drug"" there? That's ""Caution, coffee hot"" labels. list every single thing happened. Yes, happen every patient, say certainty drug, still, listening ads inspiring. ""People took drug lived lives included things."" 

I know complicated that, know lot work time goes it, I'm trying simplify years years work. appreciate many regulations alerted expect common side effects, work people go first. start ""If allergic Drug please take Drug"" swear they'd sound less like idiots. list things common COULD Thanksgiving. things happen everyone. zoned because, duh, take something allergic to, find I'm allergic taken it? Haha wonder same, doubt it‚Äôs much. Actual Tesla stock like $1800 share vs $9 share. 

I don‚Äôt think serious investors confusing lol. Maybe less experienced people using Robinhood (looks around nervously) lol. doubt it‚Äôs much. too. Got eBay. 2 dollars mask many available. dont disagree, good luck getting people follow it. seems like majority am. feel like lot stems toxic media pushing bad narratives. precisely attempted convey friends everything started plummeting. I've okay biotech healthcare alone; went cruise lines.  They're going get approved school starts. Study seems legit, it‚Äôs lung cells lab, actual human trial. anything get excited yet - lots things kill viruses lab humans. Live Texas....won't get that.....but I'm willing die vote....so line, stand. think key word ""under control"" would magical cure Covid might let us potentially enough beds hospitals.

Even roughly 30% people come shop (I'm T-Mobile rep) masks make go get car even pipe dream. way I've taught extroverts get energy others out. feeling get alone feel like relax, breathe, that's extroverts get we're socializing.

Also, stir crazy happens way sooner alone extroverts. Almost mutations pointless. receptor binding domain appears relatively conserved. addition everyone said people avoiding hospitals ""like plague"". Meaning currently Hotspot hospital likely ghost town, essentially business areas inundated covid. There's also chance (albeit unlikely) Bush-Gore situation, know wins Election night. Could imagine happened? USA would burn, conspiracy theories would flourish unchecked interesting glimpse world many us never know. Every time watch old movies (before 90s) fascinating life different interaction tasks physical in-person. imagine must like. Yes definitely protesters, nothing people wanted ‚Äúre open economy‚Äù. Fauci call out. exactly worries  ‚ÄúJapanese considerate‚Äù oh PLEASE stop nonsense. I‚Äôm Japanese aren‚Äôt different guys. Japanese people polite nice bullshit. really hate stereotype. People keep saying find massive exaggeration impact masks. take longer get US control require lockdown. Symbols mean whatever people want mean. Like language. flag forefathers fought civil war, world wars. symbol freedom hope many. many, flag represent country, represents core set values, country live values, vice versa.

HK protestors carry flag, part grandfathers funeral. people like use it, carrying part Trump administration (which abominable), current cultural climate (also highly questionable), carrying symbol freedom. country broke away imperialist force. country welcomed immigrants opportunity.

It matter America lost way, symbols still hold meaning people. see symbolism respect do.

Reducing loving flag itself, mindless deference current authority, either disingenuous ignorant. anti-intellectual disrespects lot people consider heroes. Unlikely DPA properly used this. Hmmm, yeah, totally believe people get infected. near apocalyptic explosion cases would expected demonstrations several ten thousand people standing shoulder shoulder. Indoor super spreader events comparison (in churches, choirs bars) able infect significant number people present happen protests. people following guidelines area? South Carolina, seems like one practicing social distancing wearing masks. seems like people care. store mask today people walk stand within foot me, person (other employees) wearing mask. Hey moron remember California seriously needs travelers states well! 14 day quarantine violators prosecuted. reason California follow suit this!  forget case numbers high testing. test much, many cases. article basically says disagree stats young people (people 50 charts I've seen) risk; attitude translate carriers spread infection elderly poor health.

1918 flu nasty essentially targeted young healthy people cytokine storms. question have: easy, done now? goodness sakes, KN95 masks businesses use painting things expensive sure would demand masks. Meanwhile Wisconsin apparently districts pushing go full open right away. Fucking embarrassing ugh. kid, profoundly lazy rarely homework. Sometimes kids able something fun, I‚Äôd locked inside making work would easier done time. 

That‚Äôs feel US now. America first right. Solve problems complete utter rubbish! 

I live Sthlm loads people wearing masks commuting shopping (including me). thing people talk purchase masks stupid high prices selling for. Man wake whole bunch fuck every day...This backwards country I've ever seen, I've seen least 4 different countries. shit. offered testing June 16, declined, tested resident June 30 started showing symptoms. Apparently 43/59 residents tested positive...

It definitely sounds like could caught earlier prevented exponential spread community hard time believing number stock gains roughly $300k year alone dropping 30% February March. unreal makes little sense. Intelligent people tend ""keep council"" surrounded dumbasses entire lives. Hey dipshit Well depending circumstances regarded battery, circumstances intent, age, state whether resolved already course. basically bugs non-American insane apathy. people going hold representatives accountable?

People act like politicians sport team members support *no matter what*.

Other countries shitty politicians major corruption issues usually works involved politicians don‚Äôt really make targets public outrage.

In US seems like doesn‚Äòt matter do, long ‚Äúsports team‚Äù majority support region. we've finally resorted trying get dumb people think they're smart wear masks, 'Cause tell 'em dat day smorter den intelagent folk den maybe, maybe gettn' owll dem dumbs peoples doin' da smort thangs n' wear mask an' shit. Nex ting u no, b seein' da nooz stowries say'n ""10 reasons covid bad shit, u believe numbah for."" Cause gots gettn' dear leful owda get dem shit day needs done. /S fucks sake. Hell problem people resist following medical advice wearing mask, social distancing, washing hands. pandemic could've control US people common sense, empathy, basic knowledge science medicine. shame chunk population realize masks minimize spead it, catching it, lockdowns prevent speading quickly.

Aloha u/sabre_toothed_llama, mahalo convo Forced? So, saying thought career legacy important potential humans lives could saved early adoption say thing doing?

If he's willing sacrifice something small position human life, perhaps recant Hippocratic oath go politics. something seems interested atm. Yeah shit that‚Äôs happens close schools right pandemic starts.

Several countries close schools, experience data shows schools significant source transmission. 2/100th time, always simplify fractions! Hey dumbass remeber can't know that. recession defined two consecutive quarters decline. finished second one numbers yet. depression recession lasts least 3 years can't know least 2023. Anyone telling otherwise political, trying sell something, future. He's trying kill many us possible rejecting upcoming election. Nothing see here.... removing center DISEASE control knowing anything Covid-19 infectious DISEASE. Carry on. joekerr37, please stop posting lie **""You contract virus multiple times!""**

**NO!** CDC U.K. health people said absolutely evidence period people getting virus twice exact strain!

The issue two three different strains going around different enough catch two three time one immune system weak.

However, rare people properly functional immune systems, CoVid-19 whatever strain tweaks immunity cannot get strains. thread censored.

What do? waiting test results largely get tested states. can't speed chemical reactions.  suprising mean don‚Äôt think 100 million people dying COVID WW US certainly match 1918‚Äôs pandemic levels death (like 700k iirc) winter wave x2 stronger first, totally possible. case, feel ""event"" unless fans allowed attend (which hope city allow). Otherwise another workplace.

That said, really sports whatsoever right now. Even players safe, they're adding even strain testing capacity. None things happened recent US history caused many casualties American soil though. media sells, there‚Äôs thousands Americans dying every day eventually people want hear real experts say. ""Nude Mutant Florida man rides hoverboard Miami Desert"" November 4th. post cut paste rants I'm one that's triggered? delete earlier comment. know sheltered, aseptic urban kids way likely develop immune disorders like allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases like?

It's good kid learn hygiene, also catch bug every while. things go, [that's basically Happy cake day!  Yes, data-reporting protocol ""CIR"" ""Coronavirus Real"" tens thousands children infected nation throughout world. data looks everywhere. harder get infected, infected harder pass disease on, rarely serious case covid. whatever reason, children's experience disease different flu degree, kind like everyone else. adult diagnosed mild adult Aspergers, spent whole *life* studying social behavior situations learn fit in. 

Now exact situation I've dreamed - work home, shop home, leave home. Yet I'm excelling career this, incredibly relaxed content once. Permanently revoke liquor license. Well, hell place continues gain souls, thereby means continue expanding? so, cold beyond belief. Now, hell losing souls, hot hell (yes pun) since contracting. I'm bowing type person. I'll lick feet, though. 2..5 year old daughter loves mask part personality. 5 year old age stubborn, would way he'd wear one. That's ok though, birds real. point, person could save states Trump. people lost bias. They're unreachable. de-program someone something takes tremendous amount time effort time something right now. ones baffle attend protests tell reporters immunecompromised. 

It's absolutely mind-boggling. Still think person class good Betsy? Well, since WW2. catastrophe seen much worse past century. I¬¥m surprised whole situation going somewhat positive trend considering lot people ignoring social distancing amongst things. I'm saying 50%+ someone virus himself.

There way damned communicable CoVid-19-SARS 10% populace exposed 5 months since pandemic started China. Especially since evidence CoVid going around early November United States. works, hope they'll call ""Llaccine"" confuse anti-vax folks. Honestly, much pains say it, still doubt he‚Äôll voted out. ones aren‚Äôt afraid don‚Äôt believe covid won‚Äôt problem going vote, I‚Äôll give one guess crowd tends support. trump administration knows this, think part they‚Äôre trying cover numbers. current conspiracy theory they‚Äôre trying use suppress vote (especially factor he‚Äôs voting mail). think 250 million people going die coronavirus? need exemption, leaving homes. matter much precaution take still risk. easy little vaccine low risks, get vaccine? Antibodies always disappear time it‚Äôs b cells give long term immunity antibodies usually evidence body created b cells Exactly. Dude obese AF. Feels family. 

But come on, obesity, heroin. fuckers going kept masked rest lives? fuckin better, flu kills too. Don‚Äôt hypocrite. Glue fuckin rag faces shit preach. 

Just corona gets vaccine goes away don‚Äôt mean get change preachy AF moral compasses. 

I‚Äôm whooping fukn shit Facebook friends see future don‚Äôt mask, cuz ‚Äúmuh Governor says it‚Äôs safe now‚Äù

Yeah, think that's true. rationale given Nordics recommending wearing masks think could lead lower adherence social distancing. (Though they've *very slowly* shifting issue ""okay wear guess"" level non-recommendation, rather earlier ""OMG masks bad wear them"" couple months ago.)

They point WHO, one point said masks could lead *""a false sense security, leading potentially lower adherence critical preventive measures physical distancing hand hygiene""*. terrible almost regards, must admit attracted her. Maybe sensual massage would melt away chilly heart? Shoot, live small town. Covid hit everything shut down. grocery stores delivery organized pickup. absolutely easy awesome.

Text way goods right front ready go. take care watch certain things best interest select items going etc. say ""wet,"" water's standpoint? ü§î Rimming needs duration pandemic often active covid19 virus feces.  know rimming (and anal sex) usually clean activities without detectable feces, unfortunately trace amounts matter here.

Don't use pillow sleep used hip support.  69 near pillow.

If casual encounter, wear gloves going anal play prep anal sex.  

Hopefully there's going effective vaccine this.

Oh, health authorities say doggy style, cowgirl reverse cowgirl sex positions put face face much safer face face intercourse play. Get back us four eight years Biden usually see new president political party last one follow immediately. People get tired lies broken promises current party.

If think Biden's presidency, happens, break formula, paying attention all. hard understand.

He told people _exactly_ tell people today, wear mask one, using face covering perfectly acceptable substitute one.

He could potentially thousands lives simply saying something already knew true. kids schools months could account low numbers. don‚Äôt really know numbers would schools reopened. dumb mother fuckers.   _may_ ? didn‚Äôt say otherwise :) starting feel like moving administration making worst decision contain problem actively trying make worse. Visited Johnson City, Elizabethton, Asheville last week. encounters maybe 1/5th people wearing masks Johnson City Elizabethton. Everyone wore mask inside businesses Asheville maybe half people walking past one another streets. 

I'm glad washington county instituted mask mandate. Hopeful extend months rather weeks. I'm perfectly fine staying away people, think that's thing I'm fully comprehending, much others truly need contact. enjoy company others, much absolutely exhausting. government switch like 6 months?

That's lot time virus... Every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes person gets away it, we're gonna know it. beard though exactly happening? mental health also affected year. Heck, think everyone's mental health gone downhill lately. Times crazy. still make world better place. Vote. Help others. Tbh taught lot germs reason still like pick bird feathers.

which medical report/medical research paper says""***China went 2k+ cases per day 2 cases per day single day*** ""?

 ***in single day*** \--- day?( month?)  Exactly. Children touch everything , idea virus works , touch nose , mouth  eyes lot. don‚Äôt wash hands often sanitize hands often. play toys, share toys, toilet trained (I read corona virus stays poop 5 weeks infection ) ü§¢. rub toys every , play grounds public transport . smaller ones vomit pee poop without able take care . wonder poor kiddos get sick new pathogen often grown ups transmit disease. üôÅ


Ppl really need keep kids home keep public safe. Virus cause long term damage create generation sick adults. Ah duh makes sense Wuhan lock 76days (\~ 11weeks ) make things completely control. lockdown , China CCP organized huge team ""volunteer"" doctor nurses cities/province went Wuhan support Wuhan's overwhelmed medical system pandemic .

And US number cases, death counts, many states different actions. time ,White house pushing economy reopening, reopening schools. Simply everyone wears masks cannot save US.... Lol right?! happened months ago. Lol dude, care happens outside country. Heck, even know Singapore map even country! Well duh. People don‚Äôt socially distance think virus hoax. nut jobs don‚Äôt believe science, think earth 6,000 years old, earth flat Jesus rode around back pet dinosaur. Actually doesn‚Äôt morons FAAKE! FAAAAAAAAAKE!! /s fucking legend. still remember seeing video Facebook Karen talking never going wear mask wearing one 45 minutes store.

The main take away (through tears) talking misses human contact hugging people found hard empathize. Like can't fathom missing stranger interaction damn much emotionally traumatizing me. pandemic things different now, forever. people like claim ""light headed"" whatever placebo stuff that's head wearing mask making impossible. fucking say?! needed good laugh, you‚Äôre God‚Äôs work friend. one American education system slogging graduate HS... ready go start college move fuck country.... get flu vaccine every year side effects maybe once. numbers described study normal all. relate.  they're comparing viral load swabs taken, picture painted incomplete. findings indicate milder cases virus found large numbers nasal cavity, severe cases - much. interpret severe cases ones virus makes way deep lungs and/or organs achieves large numbers there. think voting. need talk people persuade change views. easy task! Good catch. would still pick feather. wash put bookshelf. magpie feather shelf cat ate it. :p Don‚Äôt forget dr birx complaining cdc inflating deaths. suspicious can‚Äôt ignore possibility coverup. good news probably screw cover too. think around five weeks quarantine started. Absolutely insane timing. firstborn progressive lung disease considered high risk, trying isolate/quarantine protect simultaneously preparing newborn. honestly feels like I'm stuck nightmare.

I know people currently TTC mid-pandemic blows mind!

‚ÄúMan dies something, maybe symptoms, maybe not, symptoms amount time don‚Äôt know, know conditions, even covid, yeah, died waiting line‚Äù - article It‚Äôs perfectly fine around people. need accept fact *you* might get virus need best socially distance otherwise

I‚Äôm still hanging around friends since we‚Äôre younger. also keep socially distant otherwise, wear masks, won‚Äôt see grandparents time being. We‚Äôd regardless bother. US shithole country, use words dumbass-in-chief. Lol
You get point though It‚Äôs crazy difficult toddler. hands aren‚Äôt mouth, it‚Äôs they‚Äôre touching gross stuff, hugging someone, licking something. High School teacher confirm. student cough directly eyeballs week schools shut down. greatest country world ?? Looks like current administration doesn‚Äôt even common sense *I rumbly tummy hands could satisfy...* park absolutely empty, selling out. Disney World talking about, always customers. go, possibly dumbest place world go right Im hyperbolic. See kind shit hate. think calling people don‚Äôt social distancing stupid gonna encourage start social distancing? would that, I'm concerned could damage economy. class warfare end day. rich can't keep extracting wealth economic transactions economy slows much. would costly actually invest fix problem. easier pretend issue. Yep! They're making huge movement Ohio. That's long drive beer. tragic...he knows competent administration working tandem CDC implementing guidelines fighting thing could beat matter weeks. Unfortunately, denier-in-chief permit united front things unfortunately get worst due percentage undermining threat. vaccines commonly produce serious side effects. Wtf lol. comes great, need figure way manufacture billions vaccines distribute across globe, prioritizing needy without political economic policy getting way saving lives. uh, ready use public one major challenges. chickens come home roost. gonna keep winning. offence all, American problem haha. I'm amazed selection coke guys have. I'd lucky find cherry coke here, I've never seen cherry Coke zero.
Be safe there! Even thinking existing. argument people making say immunity goes away expect immunity last, say, 3-6 months fade away (or maybe all) people amount antibodies declines level longer protective. don‚Äôt good evidence say true not, is, shouldn‚Äôt expect
to see large numbers reinfections either countries, early hotspots, yet. Plus covid turns seasonal illness like common cold coronaviruses effects population immunity would obvious time year would winter. pandemic flu works: spreads least somewhat well summer immunity builds confines flu season.

Also don‚Äôt trust data coming Belarus. reported cases look like perfect bell curve inconsistent everywhere else deaths similarly suspiciously consistent 4-7 reported every day since May 4th exception two days HK 2019: get wearing mask

HK 2020: get wearing mask 1% way: long go future rich, always buy way present.

Global warming? problem, buy new house new coastline. So, make much money breaking climate afford adapt whatever comes. know there's hope future call like Unsure overnight camp summer school type thing. teacher summer camp, doubt sleeping bunks kids. Good point lunch teachers present.  
    
One thing keep mind NYC 60 public school employees died back March April. don‚Äôt believe mandatory masks time - but, school districts hot spot area reopening without mandatory masks well. One best headline I've ever read they've passed threshold, able speak lot bluntly what's going on.

All take one well designed website youtube channel + twitter account. There's reason hospitals can't publicly post anonimized *public health* data. Uh type shit exactly know China countries covering up.

I dont know single American who's tested hometown. 

Im sure there's lot unconfirmed cases right entire world even know about. Woj? Yes, polling data relies representative sample adjusting sex, race, age factors. virus follow sort patterns. mean, would gotten sick already right? nothing worry really get dictionary words dude. 2 terms thing all! What's ignorant, childish &amp; stupid vast majority entire comment history.

You're gonna throw around insult comments comparing President Obama Hitler implying Michelle Obama man? Lol. Back safe space triggered snowflake ‚ùÑ Anytime Trump *publicly* criticizes someone else something, used it, it, it. shut still reason travelling Oregon. I'm embarrassed amount CA tourists I'm serving daily basis Portland, OR. 

Stay. Home. Assholes. We‚Äôre competing worst study ever produced. / Biden office, watch numbers skyrocket finally begin take thing seriously. We're going get real data pretty.

And guess what? Trump bootlickers going absolutely destroy Biden ""handling"" pandemic. Blaming sharp rise cases deaths. mean results study pretty obvious... What's surprising sheer number idiots there.

So, pretty much, lead pictures seen 1918. simly people use field hospitals real hospitals use more. 

1918. last year WWI, conflict brutal, create new name those.

Ew Jesus, gross. No, he's making I've spent better part 5 months trying convince people wear masks United States. Despite offering solid evidence utility masks, met conspiracy theories quack science entire way.

People think masks going cause breathe lethal level CO2. cause false sense self security prevent people social distancing. masks prevent breathing virus disregard prevents unsymptomatic spread. masks government plan help identify people facial recognition software. attempt limit freedom.

Either way, please help spread truth. TEACHER UNIONS exist Texas legal adn allowed. (not strong, Texas state allow teacher strikes, Oklahoma either teachers sick iirc long ago) 

Anyway People search American Federation Teachers Texas Chapters. may chapter area AFT exists state level Texas. guess decide time pay rent, right school starts, evictions start happening, cops start getting involved, virus spiking along all. feckless leaders nothing actively make worse sort politcal gain.

Texas teacher unions teacher unions. Look up.

AMERICAN FEDERATION TEACHERS.

Maybe local chapter state level Unions exist legal allowed Texas.

How know this? Becasue districts I've worked Texas information posted teachers lounges Union reps bring free lunch meet teachers ask questions concerns may take state level.

I also issues administrator (bullying teachers) one schools serviced contacted union rep understand rights.

I know blatant liar really know truth abiut Texas born raised, educated, Texas.. UNIONS legal Texas Exist.

Spread truth. ""really"" need study know everybody ""impairs freedom wearing masks"" intentionally sending ill kids daycare etc. idiot.

But nice neithertheless. right mind wants breathe snot?? like taking dump pants dealing yours.

When U.S. institutions get money Covid deaths entire democratic party everything shit Trump, trust me, counting. mean that's basic logic regarding American business.

There also reason sneezing coughing shirt effective (or possibly effective certainly comfortable hygienic) sneezing mask. mean c'mon, feel people lost common sense.

On top wash shirt! think happens people dirty surgical masks? chuck ground, throw trash, otherwise allow float around freely. Let's begin use big brain here!!

I quote Mayo Clinic:

""At time, U.S. Food Drug Administration approved type surgical mask specifically protection coronavirus, masks may provide protection N95 masks Useless study... given. heat rises?

Here's today's data ([**CoViD-19 Cases US JHU website:

Los Angeles County: 136, 357 cases

Why deliberately posting misinformation? itself, intelligence. studies claims people keep social distancing intelligent fake stupid first place.
Any credible medical expert would say wearing mask would decrease spread ""deadly"" decease including flu. wearing mask everytime everywhere became mandatory 100 years ago?
Meanwhile UK make wearing masks mandatory shops 24th July freely enjoy beer pubs without any.
See logic misses point? news, water wet. Supports theory Americans thick pig shit. wonder. reported people higher IQ tend greener, liberal less racist don‚Äôt see much effect.


Apologies, clear enough. referring this. mask study yeah good. Shaming works. US TERRIBLE JOB MEAN CHINA WORSE JOB. I've seen least one Trumpet unironically call Fauci ""opponent"" Trump.

Wtf. Facebook IQ tests count. Yeah, can't see article adblock whatever, live AZ question accuracy study.  I'm sure Arizona probably AMONG worst states acceptance masks, people here, worst? find hard believe. Scottsdale/North Phoenix, seeing unmasked person store relatively uncommon. I'd estimate compliance somewhere 90% area, lower 80% I'd shocked. bars, gyms, theaters (where mask compliance lot lower) closed so... stores pretty much it. restaurants fucking idea still open I'm sure one wear mask there, months. whole premise ‚Äúlet people decide themselves...‚Äù motivation money fan make ~~ill-informed~~ decisions. Sometimes! were, back virus Ebola. US one largest - largest - contributors resources that. number nations provided outstanding support too, work definitely would better support, enough prevent global spread.

Imagine Trump Ebola instead. least Ebola spread nearly easily, virus would limited much Africa, would still massive international travel disruptions ensure patients get passenger aircraft. true, statistically northern states experiencing unprecedented spikes right now.  Im sure Trump lose tbh Pretty sure correlation risk factors (like diabetes, smokeing etc.) stupidity. Maybe Darwin take action.   _waves Albertan_ /r/coronavirus \*patting shoulder\*. like chickenpox causing shingles road. knows virus may able stay dormant years flare line. risk take. protestors anti-Trump said CDC one-week lag reporting hospital data.

Not sure that's fast slow. want bicker cases ""truly"" COVID-related send data places? HHS picture? Voting least do. vote, pretend stops there. ""Hell people"" -Sartre highest stock market gains percentage great depression, so... wear god damn mask. Fuck. Imagine children react covid flu.

And defined water, effort, ""Water"". going allow 3rd party contractors gather data. Yeah, that's going end well.  multiple factors play intelligence one them. Another cult psychology another way people consume news. Many right wing people know receive news second, third, fourth hand. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmy friend told Christian radio host said Tucker Carlson said Fox Friends said interview Trump.‚Äù kidding here. Never go full 1918... people don‚Äôt social distance dumb? bar low right now. look polling, it‚Äôs consistently 20-30ish% respondents aren‚Äôt never okay lockdown measures instituted fairly early pandemic. 

But lot dumb reasons, seem get say policy decisions 2/3rds country. Many teachers Texas think unions illagel joined. unions, can't collective bargain can't strike.

Latest American Federation Teachers union page looked Texas info ebinars teachers, iirc explaining FMLA.

Which think teachers sickout Texas, legally, call sick day, like that's going happen Texas teachers consistently voted self interests afraid anything sort would jeopardize career.

Understand, Texas teachers consistently voted leaders wanted weaken unions, destroy public schools, Texas teachers even believe unions exist Texas listening, aware rights possibly. hookworms Florida brutal greyhounds seem sensitive chronic infection. We‚Äôve success protocol (drontal/interceptor plus alternatively every 2 weeks) vets office panacur isn‚Äôt working well anymore. could ask vet it.

It's like overload health system long run. (I know US's public health system great, even worst) capitalist America, line waits (to die). political position stupidity. solution. cost parents extra $100 per year, number anti-vaxxers drop half. costs $1000 per year, they'll drop 90%.

And that's drop bucket compared costs push rest society. Gotta look good even deathbed Ah, shot-in-the-dark type claims people said wear masks short months ago. Use mouth speak, asshole. Maybe assume politicians something it? Ya think  read somewhere Malaysian contact tracing done manually. in, real humans paid make phone calls, track runaways, conduct extensive interviews every single infected patients contacts.

In 2020 system sounds like bit relic, guess tried tested proven highly effective. Well thank letting us know Beijing thinks. nobody wears masks phoenix, infuriating Well ill be. know water wet? I‚Äôve used friends source it‚Äôs apparently good enough. Seemingly thinks friends better mine. way eliminate anti-vaxxers remove child tax credit (which reduces parent's taxes) kid vaccinated. hard do; already system charges extra fee taxpayer purchased health insurance. 

Many regions/states already procedures forms verify vaccination legitimate reasons vaccinated (high risk, undergoing treatment something else, etc). used school districts ensure kids properly protected. new technology radical change anything already do.

If parents realize it'll cost money avoid vaccinations - tiny fraction amount cost health system - they'll stop antivaxxers. Yeah, keep thinking about. Even loses, acting President worst 2nd wave/seasonal flu health experts *already* starting freak about. either a) plotting stay office, regardless election b) furious losing deliberately let country slide chaos ""revenge"". Great. Create parallel society can't bothered learning local language. want live among brits americans, live UK US, Spain.

This confusing. articles said Russian team claimed first complete trials, part said completed Phase I, way behind Oxford. Looks like bad journalism. it‚Äôs novel.  That's great news. real LPT always comments

Go out, protest, rally, fucks sake, something include sitting ass twiddling thumbs.

People gave lives less others free/live better lives, shouting front whitehouse long, LONG overdue. they're fucking dangerous chickens you, wearing mask added benefit hiding facial features! ‚ÄúNo freedom‚Äù ass Lol fucking hilarious believe hahhaa reason hospitals comply need continue elective surgeries order fund hospital.

The way insurance companies decided amount pay treating viral pneumonia even let hospitals break even. filter health decisions for-profit insurance scheme flatly blame. I've never unpatriotic entire life. shatter record Friday, that's cases filed. extroverted love people. quarantine country sucked stayed home. zoom discord calls friends keep touch see anyone except went grocery shopping.

And btw something US probably ready deal : sometimes wait line groceries store allow certain number people time. waited queues, social distance. country that's seeing rapid increases cases right going absolutely fucked Autumn arrives. hope USA/Brazil/India turn things around soon looking good all. cannot eat drink mask on? exercising home, again, mask needed.

So that's mention masks, ya Nancy Problem US folks everything political. Mask use fairly simple enforce looking cheap solution probably best feasible solution.

Blood samples 2015 showing T-cell immunity also. Personally, I'm going use cull acquaintances, like I'm going use future question weed potential new jobs. 

I see outside without mask? longer want around you. 

Your COVID response try bring entire office back ASAP? That's place longer want work at. 

No one asking people stop going outside, _yet_. That's possibility people can't behave though. That's part Italy got control, Wuhan. 

What really makes angry seeing fast cities put curfews effect try stop BLM protests, they're going put kid gloves masks self isolations. news: People go night clubs global health pandemic may less intelligent, study says  Counties California huge compared states.

This already happened daily kids‚Äô school, pre-covid. swear every day least one child either puking, fever, lice, sore throat (strep) waiting outside main office parent pick up. parent available, lie cot secretary‚Äôs office- frequented kids, office runners, staff. 

So let‚Äôs throw covid mix. schools write policies procedures want - implementing situations impossible.

I've seen veterans go loving Mattis calling ""disgruntled ex-employee"" period week so, Mattis dismissed. listened BS Trump talk radio. Limbaugh Hannity needs ended, good country. Thanks, I'll best. Twitter goddamn stupid social media platform. mask reusable. filters not. read article? can't make water wet already is. Good. Maybe they'll better health virus hits. Bahahahaha

God hope borders closed people forever. hell talking about? flare ups strict organised teams population deal that. 

1. borders already progressively opening strict quarantine, testing 14 day isolation.

2. already early likes film crews flying safe, rugby teams likely live play NZ due safety.

3. NZ countries working hard vaccine.
You need kill population order make money vaccines.
The medical industry refuse sales vaccine due organised country dealing properly.

Im absolutely stunned whatever point trying make. try articulate point again, clearly? sure, they're beautiful, want to-wait minute... Time see doctor. Yeah! cares whether vaccine makes produce antibodies! Great point! depends strategy. countries cases extended period time ex. &lt; 20 day

That's there's little travel going though. virus contained country, there's little spread easier trace contain existing spread. 

I cant imagine good world economy go whole year people travelling much internationally though. Eventually, we're going open up, easy get imported cases countries cant handle it.

Programs like ""change mind,"" Shapiro's college visits, become catalyst young Republicans argue. literally copy republican hosts say debates professionals, arguments lay Democrats online.

Just look Republicans ""owning liberal snowflakes"" videos. hardcore parroting jerk it. almost fell shit myself. Isin't wet means water you? guess one isolated water molecule water, there's couple, means water ""on"" water molecule thus making wet thus water wet making wet. 

I know I'm talking about... POCUS imaging studies spanish doctor media tab. light symptoms minor pneumonia (SpO2 never dropped 95%) dude still cardiac effusion even symptoms resolved visible ultrasound

Also, I've bitten hedgehog! countries compare testing US? Within top 5 countries, much testing per day? infographic there? think countries amount testing. Lmao Reddit. amount overconfident, superiority circle jerking never fails amaze me

Imagine thinking naturally intelligent political opinions lmao. know certain country back 30s thought naturally intelligent everybody else.... r/ThisSubHasGoneToShit Try asking who's numbers believe. Really, challenge find source claim - defend - reliable.

He able come one. ask say numbers wrong, can't show anyone else's better. tries ""well modify numbers xyz"", let try - that's replacing facts convoluted process confuse conversation (and already know he'll try exclude every death person sniffled once). Really nail it, get plant flag something he's willing say accurate. 

Because says *no one* reporting anywhere near accurately - ask **he really thinks knows better literally every expert nation**. works technical field, maybe ask thinks everyone else nation knows job better does, get feeling like shoe foot.

Anyway, getting say believe - sources trust - major step. Climate change denialists won't/can't this, mostly every credible source disagrees them. takes LOT patience, persistence, tell stop spouting answer question. Headpats given that's blatantly political move Liar-in-Chief. backfire badly add even doom reelection chances. Sorry dude. feel bad it. like actually caused this. made things easier you, make guilty anything. 

I feel though. last 4 years I've working evening shifts, I've get early take kid school appointment, run chores try get sleep get home. get up, drive work.

These last months times I've averaged 6 hours sleep per day years.

If Covid19 disappears sudden back way before, 'd probably drop dead.

Just stay kind, stay calm, stay safe. We've getting away awful attention USA. need better starting masks, nobody wears :( sure article ‚ÄúThe Onion‚Äù ? somebody got paid I'm sure decent sum money come conclusion somebody paid decent chunk money study. [Brazil means vaccine works wear mask, mean seatbelt.

Did know seatbelt used properly still mess shit up?  defending reckless behavior, government can't block Canadian citizen entering country. Keeping away social media, duh! people actually surgery reasons esthetic ones. Piss poor article time pat back. Even intelligent it‚Äôs still dumb people gets us killed ‚Äî history tells FUXKING AGAIN. read testing memory IQ. Memory considered intellect? know many intelligent people can‚Äôt remember lunch, hand know people photographic memories social IQ shut in. defines intelligence? Oh yea people like shame others noncompliance. get  words everything going on. sick tired trump administration. Water gets water wet, makes wet whole. That's popular hypothesis, unproven hypothesis. many Christians fact fake Christians. Somebody tell dead people work. shop. US deserves better US administration,

Except allowed monster get elected. punishment...  Get load low IQ individual! I've socially distancing whole life.  long since I've inside Best Buy lol guess different now. Fuck this.

Why going work today? turn boogers yes no, letting patients know positive.

I trust military report honestly. 

Ex army spouse - 13 years, sons bitches gaslit bullied staying abusive partner - even threatening legal action left ass.

FUCK MILITARY!!!

(4 years free autistic kids getting bruises; 6 years free military. never, ever forgive them) Yet another many reasons teacher Florida. naive, thats world works. 18 year olds legally adults (so state) parents *still parent* putting roof head food table. ‚Äûcontract‚Äú basically still stands respect parents decisions. act live like adult make adult choices. 18 magical number comes social relationships. window_of_opportunity2 entered chat government powder keg, people peaceful. still protests EVERY DAY nyc, vigils near mayors mansion every single night.

Please dont classify whats happening streets america riots, large majority violence form use police weaponry protestors. high positivity rate basically test almost exclusively sick people (tests made primarily hospitals, known exposed individuals medical personnel). high positivity rate mean anything context, confirming already suspicious cases. consequence small number testing demographics focused on. Different gov't, different protocols.

You also mention numbers estimated 10 times higher US. estimation made Brazil similar 10-to-1 ratio found (they used ""sentinel"" testing groups, basically random population testing, spread around many cities states, extrapolated rest population). studies, based statistics though, pointed maximum 16-to-1.

Finally, death-to-number-of-cases ratio similar many countries. number os deaths accurate number (hard fake hide, usually full clear covid symptoms), ratio compatible see anywhere else, indicates coherent, plausible number cases (at least coherent plausible anywhere else).

So see. Although Brazil's number far good, argument, respectful opinion, really accurate. people make this?

Found fuck load morons another thread recently experience true. job decided make people wear masks also can't make someone quarantine exposure coworker tested positive, can't make anyone get tested, test positive can't make stay home unless fever temperature checkpoint entering building. live northern Europe dark year haven‚Äôt taking vitamin believe might normal. think try get phone doctor dosage, thanks suggestion! genuinely interested hearing folks refuse wear masks, decided so. gather, seems coming mindset folks concerned erosion rights.

I tend think way: understand people concerned rights, say oneself ""I allow government dictate particular behavior, however, citizen concerned health welfare fellow citizens consciously choose free wear mask.""

Wearing mask seems simpler severe lockdowns, no? I'd love see patriots, progressives, centrists, left, right come together issue. Let's try see work. 

Again, disagree interested opinion- I've wondering driving anti-mask sentiment.  protect others around don‚Äôt wear masks practice social distancing? they've politicized mask wearing point guy stabbed another person shot dead police refusing wear mask. read rest comment know single measure rather combination measures constitute severe restriction. disagree, people socially distance *wiser* necessarily intelligent.

Intelligence knowing tomatoes fruit. 
Wisdom putting fruit salad. 

Bards work around. big source bias discrimination England

Seems like musical this. Man wish people delivering Amazon packages got little extra something.. think want dead, give fuck. way, lied sheeple! smartest thing listen dumb science man. Dumb science man know make good choice. blame him. governor made masks mandatory state week, next day local authorities said got bunch pleas people area follow said worry, intention enforcing it. Everyone worried fReEdOm, they're still grasping this. Arkansas way.

Her family infected family member come town wasn‚Äôt feeling well didn‚Äôt share information exposed another family member exposed Magnolia,‚Äù Miranda Cowgur explained 40/29 News. ‚ÄúAnd Thursday [July 9, 2020], that‚Äôs Magnolia‚Äôs symptoms started. diarrhea, really fussy norm.‚Äù

Her little ‚Äúhello world‚Äù shirt. True say is, worse.. inconvenience, potential getting spreading covid?

I look like this.. mask may nothing help end.. Maybe doctors scientists wrong.. Maybe conspiracy theorists finally got right, wearing mask type thought control experiment.. But, maybe not. 

If even small chance wearing mask save someones life, save someone's family torn apart, even save pains associated covid.. choose deal inconveniences, take risk government somehow infiltrated every mask producer across globe. ;)  see thats makes ya smart ya smart enough know ..that dont know like.. everything..like Socratses Why? one side valid point ""killing others"" ridiculous.

Have head sand last 4 months? literally happening. stops 'values' actions literally endangering people. young people aren‚Äôt intelligent? That‚Äôs 90% see socially distancing. study seemed focus older people. Probably good thing US done far Operation warp speed, dump much money possible potential vaccines. Christmas Thanksgiving parties winter, Halloween.   entitled opinion point. source information 100% contradictory rather less damning report others. brain visiting friend? seems absent. wouldn‚Äôt surprised virus would catalyst another world war. every country‚Äôs economy destroyed exactly leads world war. 
Sorry, personally alarmed cynical/negative sometimes impossible see something like coming chaos world. Plus enough NBA players get sick bubble, next month, there‚Äôs real possibility NBA shuts playoffs it‚Äôs over. Hence huge financial hit likely. Whereas restaurant casino worker jettisoned, replaced another low wage worker. mean, sounds like exact reason statewide emergency test alerts created. emergency mandate wear masks instituted, want constituency informed immediately? worst part won‚Äôt even know bad really unless hospitals refuse Tr*mps bullshit order keep sending info CDC. Exactly; campaign needs shut down. good lord rant. ever city yourself? Looking purely deaths damage economy, understand would say that. need consider long term health impact well. brother ""mild"" case Corona (no hospitalization), 5 months later still able walk 5km. Obviously, able go work. healthy 30y old pre-existing conditions. cost healthcare corona survivors huge. Maybe use resume. Lmao news , water ..wet!! poor leadership, awful problem solving, embarrassing public speaking, total lack empathy US citizens, total disregard scientific facts, jacked idiotic math, current Admin great job. Fox News needs class-action lawsuit 50 states. Exponential growth continually accelerate though, fact opposite case - it'll reverse slow greatly higher amount population people consistently I'd boat buddy. Hell measurement suggests happening, even prior COVID-19, acceptable good way.

So explain health nation based feel rather scientific measures?

While certainly crisis right now, US overall strong economy. US saw huge growth GDP since 2008 crisis, growth seen rest developed world. Incomes time high US highest post tax median income world. looking recovery metrics seeing encouraging. create fear misinformation, fact economy really well COVID seeing encouraging signs strong recovery. Yeah, I‚Äôm point soon vaccine released, lockdowns restrictions need end. really scared still stay home dumb refuse get sick. rest us get back living. Americans already travelling. want beach, got lot beaches, want lake, got many lakes, want desert, we've got that, want tropical tropical, want rain forest, temperate tropical rain forests. really reason leave US right saying. can‚Äôt really get detail, would recommend keeping cash hand. deeper stats symbolic crash ripping right now. 

Fed pump cash depends getting right folks not. Won‚Äôt every sector turn year looking pretty bad right now. 2021 lay-off wave already beginning. needed study conclude this?? can't. Money magically grow trees. WaPo put paywalls articles like virus really mutating though, yes true immunity might last forever, question long reinfections happen less severe? It‚Äôs mostly people spend nearly time cooped inside it‚Äôs warm. much easier spread virus people closer proximity poor ventilation windows closed. Even 1000 deaths it‚Äôs much less lesser cases April. healthcare folks done great. barely English.  TIL could Harvard doctor. One tool would wonders available: legal instrument states use close borders. Federal policy leaving decisions state works shitty ones can't travel responsible ones. possible state ban visitors, set travel bubbles like-minded governors, good ones would better off, bad ones would solid example follow. think single biggest thing would help, I'm pretty sure impossible. right, read completely forgot it. don‚Äôt score doesn‚Äôt matter it. According asymptomatic people can't spread it. goes? talking about? report? never report. know talking about. Go away seen associating you! Coming soon America near you. Well, really hope situation will, point near future, allow again. Although last weeks pessimistic soon :( BLM fucking country fuck enough, clearly.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* BLM protesters rioters smart then. Mine medical consensus expert opinion large. That‚Äôs difference. 

You that, you‚Äôre really proving point.  Found article antibodies (the previous pandemics werent like antibodies lasted) covid lasts couple months tops according study. unless people get vaccinated 3-4 times year vaccine could work case. Still needs peer reviewed. 26 day wait? That‚Äôs insane. test positive, asymptomatic person, that‚Äôs long time spread it. husband drive AJ Gold Canyon pick groceries Frys...(pick free, delivery $9.99) aside elderly.....it seems hardly ANYONE age 70 wears mask AJ......(or Globe, Superior......we went Durango SHOCKED lack mask wearing (about 50%). worked operating room decades used wearing masks.....(and touching face!), also terrible claustrophobia...so get it.....but also seen death....is wearing mask 15/30 minutes worth person's life? Reality sets QUICK life threatening situation. time, hospitals struggling enough masks health care workers. rush already understocked supply PPE, health care workers would decimated causing deaths panic. 
Giving U.S. chance bump supply production declaring importance masks likely saved hospital system crashing. anti body count goes reinfection happens, would reinfections generally less severe severe? People say gets hot wear heat, stupidity. mean... yeh? know mucus dispersal happens? There's nothing US Japan except encourage deepen economic ties regions ween American markets. presence 50K troops Japan gives China pause, what's diff 3,000? Kick 'em except nukes troops maintain weapons. think China afraid Russia US. Zero accountability contractor government employees. Here‚Äôs goes.

McKinsey going slick make buck ‚ÄúAdvising‚Äù. That‚Äôs do. They‚Äôll schedule bunch interviews/meetings deliver fancy document.

Government employees receive recommendations document bury folder. much time goes it‚Äôs obsolete.

Rinse repeat.

Actions/implementation done timely manner provide results. Thanks It‚Äôs kids it‚Äôs teachers getting sick point contention ex I. would accuse trying make feel stupid used words understand, even simply overhearing conversation client. conversations could get technical, course going words layperson grasp. area FL? Curious wearing mask small town thing it‚Äôs also happening cities. 

I don‚Äôt know anyone living could cavalier considering what‚Äôs going right now. even like choices hard. reasonable individual smart enough actually right. He's agenda he's throwing everything sun it. anyone support this? Hmmm, yes, yes. Indubitably. Yeah, actually fractured shoulder January bad since everything taken care COVID spread area. Glad instead now. raised born ‚ÄúA lot people showed didn‚Äôt really think twice whole virus, won‚Äôt happen us, know? believe around least 300, could closer 400,‚Äù Cole Wood ‚ÄúI two three friends time come like, hey, I‚Äôm sick, said, too, that‚Äôs weird. started putting two two together like, could bad,‚Äù Wood said.

even... *Surprised Pikachu face* That's weird. thought intelligent people actively ignored social distancing mask wearing protocol complaining Facebook somehow hoax created Bill Gates CCP microchip convert sharia law. /s really thought going use Production Act effectively. are, think. getting pressured district. It‚Äôs really scary, hope right. never thought Disney would open. whole thing confusing dangerous. think. already started mass production. Exactly. point, see it‚Äôs obvious there‚Äôs many people don‚Äôt know think critically issue (or anything), impacts discourse this, lot things Eventually sure. 20 something makeing 30k year, paying student loans, high interest personal loan, rent, food, baby, little difficult especially pandemic. anything different since last time reported numbers. No? Guess reason expect trend change... worked government could call military ATCs scab new batch civilian ones could trained.

How would replace every teacher country military ranks? wretched lot deliberate nefarious reasons, think two party system reverted form tribalistic thinking country. political system summarized red vs blue fuck's sake. realize support man dementia attraction children? someone explain flu season winter? winter makes body susceptible virus? lack vitamin D? cold? 

I would assume social distancing would least easier winter talking deciding go not, except fact events take place indoors. least AC won‚Äôt right?
 
I honestly don‚Äôt know answer would love know! one insists making dangerous view dissenters dangerous rest us. 

Except case 'dissenters' literally dangerous anyone come contact with.

A better comparison asymptomatic covid 19 infection wearing mask drunk driving. drink drive, yes harmed anybody yet, statistically, much likely sober, therefore laws driving drunk others' protection. Sure maybe crash anybody driving drunk maybe infect anybody wearing mask, statistically likely either cause harm people cases, government put laws/mandates place protect people?  ‚Äúgoing be‚Äù BAD - inaccurate reporting disclosures lol what? rich people tend live pricey urban places: NYC choice areas, Boston, DC, Seattle....

some people may prefer rural lifestyle, far majority. use better safe sorry method. genuinely wonder African's look us like... guys real? 600k die throwing fucking hissy fit? like 8m deaths year various treatable illnesses. like 600k deaths year diarrhea. guess neighbors start disappearing supposed think moved farm, died covid. know keep wondering special educaation law programming services countries. know kids may still need help phsycially wipe noses, get lunch, walk hall, meltdown noises classmate humming day.. Significant adaptive behavior needs intellectual disabilities kind kids.

Everyome keeps saying countries go regular schools too, assume means fully included campus kids without disabilities, classrooms peers. I'm really sure that.

Does anyone really know? believe tell physically distance. compare pandemic 1918 one really ought adjust population judging severity it. I'm thankful companies going route even later be.

I contacted local grocery store last week situation getting worse worse week store near me. people wearing masks, distancing customers, ignoring one-way flow traffic aisles.

Their response employees required wear masks right governor mandating people wear masks public, optional customers.

I responded saying whether governor mandates matter. private business mandate customers wear masks. health well customers, reason to? also pointed two competitors within five miles store require masks (Whole Foods Trader Joes) despite governor mandating them.

They essentially response. social distance actually deficit working memory measured part learning disability. study offers explanation whatsoever. friends still denial. Numbers testing increased say. told guess three children I'd never taken pregnancy test. still get it. watched man Food lion mask beneath chin hand cake deli girl mask nose, decorated. waited took diet soda bottle rolled forehead like hot. beat tracks even cashier mask nose. hands friends. Mortality rate Spanish Flu roughly .5 percent US population. rate applied current population, number fatalities Covid 19 would exceed 1.65 million reach level.

Some really fucked shit would happen order hit many deaths vaccine widely distributed.

My assessment Spanish Flu far deadly Covid. Lots young people died back then, relatively quickly Spanish Flu vs mostly older people health problems Covid. seems long haulers covid generally athletic people. Based course random responses covid positive Reddit. Clearly scientifically backed all, people think healthy makes Gucci. much not. seen people arguing safety measures?

You're fucking genius, trust me. physically distance social distance...brain   shame upvote comment once.

For mindful people 2020 year hermit. point someone else? Idiocracy wrong. Isn‚Äôt somewhat obvious bit?  Really good. new ICU patients since 1 July either Norrbotten. somebody trying hide evidence trump\_19 virus .. Citizens rabid citizens go outside without masks.

In case apparently people slow testing work, attempting censor doctors cdc work either, see direct intervention. 

Trump fired CDC. strongly suggests kind damage way limited older patients. know viruses work know least one thing anti mask dipshits Antibody testing New York suggests many 2/3rds people communities may already exposed six months, long term infection rate definitely going high. there's good news overall death rate could 1%, better 1918. america infectious disease considered politics. 1918 influenza pandemic severe pandemic recent history. caused H1N1 virus genes avian origin.‚Äù

It seems teacher shortage myth lot Texas. least, back home seems there‚Äôs shortage people want teach full time, there‚Äôs shortage regular full time teacher jobs. listen people experts loud, already intelligent 50% population. takes brains imagination entertain alone never really lock down, anti masker capital world. drive quite bit tend eat lunch car, gas station people watching gone new heights. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 1/3 participation far masks go area outside groceries stores. doesn‚Äôt seem apply smaller businesses especially car dealerships   kick rocks ape ""Who controls past, controls future: controls present, controls past‚Ä¶ "" point people close together they're outside. Also wind outside carry droplets away opposed closed room everyone breathes air hours.
That's countries mandate masks inside public buildings, shops, public transport etc. requiring masks outside. Catholic Church gonna canonise hero saint? Got Trump trying push sight he‚Äôs still fighting want say one word you. one word: Plastics. wonder cost taxpayers detail, accuracy timelines reporting better worse. Colbert's Late Show, Norah O'Donnell CBS said others repeatedly blocked White House attempt interview Dr. Fauci. dipshit president cutting flow information months. Right, lemmings fall right cliff, sheep least follow another animal person want protect them.

Like I'm sheep. listen Dr. faucci. Yup, this.

We've got sizable cult US. can't argue people cult. takes years professional work get people un-programmed.

The reality ignore make progress US order save themselves. sad stupid time. would get 2.6 billion infections worldwide I'm sure nothing virus making look bad swing States...... See told everyone could handle myself! biggest problem studies they're really testing whether masks protect wearers. they'll take residence halls university wear masks. they're locked building duration study. They're still going community one else wearing masks. least 2 studies looked at, participants required wear outside hall. 

So like trying model whether masks work partial compliance 2% population. much less published whether effective widespread usage public health measure. Sending military coverup. Pure Steven King horror happening now. Counter point. Water molecules water. Almost everyone masks you‚Äôre talking ass. say anything wearing mask? issue masks. Since masks work though, government forcing businesses close? practical solution? hot zones south epidemic wildly control demand tests far exceeds capacity. bottleneck appears lab side since take 5-10 days get results. 

It‚Äôs like beginning. think you‚Äôre sick aren‚Äôt actively dying stay home you‚Äôre better. It‚Äôs behind paywall, *doesn‚Äôt* belong there. 

Did read article, worked title? Imagine ""patriotic"" think anything country. think die country. proud fly large US flag back pickup truck. get angry someone ""disrespects"" flag care country much.

Then asked wear mask protect health lives fellow citizens, freak refuse.

How people claim love country much time caring people around make country? haven't, zero sources say CDC longer access data. crying ""saying"" die instead unemployment. crying going work. risk going work special im sorry feel deserve special treatment whatever reason.   probably haphazardly lock different states different amounts time different times, hope best. probably disappear like magic that. in, water fact wet. good people dying it. Lots shitty people called hoax pushed nothing also died. one cares shitty people, experience loss good person goes.

It's one cry trump goes, man mourned. Meanwhile, friend works hospital New Jersey treats COVID patients. One top doctors even died big surge. Physicians pay 401ks cut. I'm thinking it'll convenient die point dont trust trump guess Lmao really did, hard keep outraged changes every week. plague killed almost every infected person. casualties, also less infected people total. whole ward cancer patients? That‚Äôs awful. sorry hear that. definitely think anti mask thing IQ test sort. many types intelligence all. good chunk America failed test. 

I think lot celebrity worship. place less smart people pedestals aspiration. People place Kim Kardashian level Ruth Bader Ginsberg, kid not. would rather read meme book. think pretty obvious American culture vapid self-absorbed cesspool brands misinformation. 

We accept handling crisis ways people‚Äôs best efforts. Scary isn‚Äôt it? laws sole purpose protecting people dumbass choices. Im Luxembourg, gov wants test whole country.

We tests per capita europe also test non residents. (20% positiv tests non residents)

Only 3 persons icu, ony 1 person died last 2 months neighbours still classified us high risk region.

So words, punish us test more. machine wheels moved room, connections body (the tubes go vessels) detach, die Lol fuck next telling people wave loaded guns around smarterer don't. I‚Äôm thinking buying house Florida people expired due stupidity. gone remain? prefer live without stupid people anywhere near me.  great news! another 2 years 50 articles week saying cure testing! believe that, go get Facebook, find news article wearing masks, try reason them. crazy people took comment!

Seen plate influx.

My theory pandemic people work.

Kids school traveling car.

That's we're seeing plates too.

People want fly. Wishing could upvote (and time, noting irony manipulated data). see anything beneficial positive highly suspect decision administration. 

If someone does, please explain me. Yeah, obvious trump managed get sycophants there. people acted like birx ashamed trump saying stupid shit kept thinking watching internal struggle trying think he's moron simultaneously sycophant presumably respects given behavior, back tried criticize part science team got treated like crazy person pro-science side.


Can also take second say surreal say words pro-science side? like we're back middle ages people.

This fourth iteration comment, time removed incivility automod. happens again, well, even know say. news, water might wet. I'm regular person, hero! I'm canada. province made masks mandatory city last week... I've wearing one since March tho.

Quebec bad right live close Quebec it. think province sub 1300 active cases today 14 million people ok. Hope things improve soon! believe demographics study pretty racist look correlations called ‚Äúintelligence test‚Äù worse then. Jeez Probably presymptomatic ""Peace never option"" -goose Maybe it‚Äôs election year, I‚Äôve never really liked options. Maybe could get better candidates could get better results. There's many indications death figures under-reported.  sure downvoted. They've added billions debt load, loss billions, furloughed thousands employees, slashed across board exec pay checks...

It's good thing diverse portfolio dabble everything. (21st century, Disney +)

But parks, cruises, products make bulk income. get 2/3rds number from? argumentative curious. Also case fatality rate rise infection rate continues rise hospital systems become overwhelmed.  estimated 1 5 people require inpatient care numbers get lot worse longer get care. smarter corpse died covid saying much, though. Wasn‚Äôt McKinsey advised government cut food save money ICE detention centers? ICE shot idea even thought concentration camp-y? Yep make 1.8% world much larger proportion total testing done world Lots people do, unfortunately. says things totally seriously smoking drinking daytime there's pulmonary pandemic...idk, kind wish he'd cut out. 

Why? doubt glass whiskey cigar twice week negates everything Love Joe, seriously idk wtf he's lately. 

Dude mad America fat can't run mile, basically.

July 15, 2020 9:00 editorial Anthony Fauci running Donald Trump White House November. needs clarifying attests negative attention bestowed America‚Äôs top infectious-diseases expert president. Dr Fauci frozen out: last briefed Mr Trump eight weeks ago, revealed FT weekend. administration also spun Covid-19 pessimist, blocking reopening schools commerce. Officials sent journalists ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù list allegedly erroneous past remarks. Mr Trump criticised name television. Even Joe Biden, president‚Äôs Democratic challenger, received less animus deplore treatment Dr Fauci, necessary believe public health leaders infallible.

I've stopped going grocery stores, gas stations, pretty much place people. going bad, like slow moving invisible hurricane. fine hits landfall, WHAM! Everyone sick. shit sherlok üòÖ Plus foreclosures. Looks beautiful! Happy Cake day! anything feel like damage disease downplayed media since people rationalizing minimizing away saying would get mild case ""healthy"", ""youngish"", ""like totally great immune system"" (whatever means).

I best immune system. going tired immunity, that's immune immune system is. going beautiful cytokine storm. lupus got ten feet higher. there‚Äôs argument made government waste. 

Those millions tax dollars could creating jobs elsewhere public service instead lining pockets overpaid management consultants. summer instead staying home people traveling even usual.
Its bizarre.  Thanks summary, that's really encouraging. believe x smarter you.

Not study claimed. Username check out.  Look China *outside* big cities everybody knows about. Half even seen technology. would guess trace case back visitor refused quarantine they‚Äôd fry them.

Keep working it. /s Neither homes. Also think I've struck nerve I'll keep it. bad MAGA clan wont care American feel. many asymptomatic people getting tested right forced quarantine one would get tested. testing pregnant women? Paywall guidelines? mask social distancing requirements schools here. Never does!  came Trump vs intelligence. It‚Äôs catch easily, it‚Äôs factors correlate marginalized communities poorer health, obesity, etc. prove fatal comes Covid.  insult ""person"" said doubt views ""they"" presenting representative actual personal opinion. I.E. calculated push agenda. Lol thanks see 4 years? I'd say 4 decades ever since Reagan destroyed country. experience ""no masks"" crowd also believe Bill Gates trying implant microchips bodies vaccine ""he invented"" virus also invented. 

I think part study, agree ensuring plenty virus circulating. guess need successful study. throw American exceptionalism there: political landscape screwed rural = biased information sources extremely accurate rule thumb. *oh shit I‚Äôm awake* May be? But, labeled sheep 'tard listening to;

-scientists

-doctors

-medical experts

-people exposed COVID19 got sick

Wait, let's cut bullshit. People social distancing masks so, fighting optics. 

They see mask social distancing criticism towards President lashing out.

I think due lack intelligence. think due serious mental illness. Imagine defending McKinsey. Imagine defending McKinsey this. what? fell job creator meme?

Edit: last guy met McKinsey late 20s nice ass Porsche. associate. need stand them.  Pay want uncomfortable. Or, get caught outside want rona we‚Äôre talking working memory here. need working memory every one fields. play intelligence. workout home make limited trips outside essentials only. Masks ready. hand sanitizer deck even then, numbers discouraging people‚Äôs disregard makes feel like point?  doesn‚Äôt help either outlets like Fox News OAN still shilling it‚Äôs flu, it‚Äôs overblown, sequelae serious complications, including organ damage, either hoaxes rare statistically insignificant.  They‚Äôve debating Colorado, many Texans second home. It‚Äôs contentious, be. can‚Äôt people stay TF home? ""pray God""

Unfortunately, that's big reason got mess. statistics hospitalization rates across different age groups? Death rate age group? compare flu?

These important numbers know since US, super expensive hospitalized. badass. it‚Äôs 1 4, high rona figures guess there‚Äôs larger sample size longer amount time likely contributor difference results I‚Äôm sure got early age notion ‚Äúthe liar‚Äôs punishment‚Äù. idea came little idea karma basically idea thoughts revolve around deceiving people, tend project behavior others don‚Äôt believe anything anyone says. Even they‚Äôre 100% straight dead nuts honest you.

A liars punishment can‚Äôt believe anyone. 

iirc, one Trump‚Äôs first lessons dad: trust one.

EDIT: quick google reveals quote George Bernard Shaw:

‚ÄúThe liar's punishment is, least believed, cannot believe anyone else.‚Äù Well said, friendo. winter discontent. Dont need study tell mean like rising national death rate, soon 1,000 death day again, excess death rate ~50% places like Florida last 5 months? laughed reading title. help myself. Yup. Welcome neighborhood. :( extra fun try walk dog people intentionally running within couple inches prove Constitutional right breathe me. need expensive look part, though. Mainly expensive. Copenhagen  4070 4007 == 1.57 %

Central Jut 1258 1252 == 0.48 %

Northern Jut 1003 973 == 3.08 %

South DK   886 858 == 3.26 %

So, actually might Germans too. North Jutland one may also cluster Hj√∏rring still spreading. Danish officials really commented uptick yet, unfortunately, EXCEPT say *wasn't* due kids' camp Jutland closed police preventative fashion. spelled fascism wrong. Nice try, though.

Then got put vent ain‚Äôt got better since Video breaks COVID-19 affects children see dumb people every day, wearing surgical masks cloth masks talking , laughing, walking side side, like good old days pre March 2020. yet country continues let America set standard. let Germany set standard, instead settle better Americans. Whether response covid19, less blatantly racist society, long better America, Canadians satisfied. super frustrating, aim much better. message got removed unfortunately.

Still full panic mode? start see viruses part life panic media lot people demand right getting isolated

They say neighbours arent testing much stop testing much too. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really hard better US point, sadly. 139 clients contacted, contact-traced, 49 agreed tested. Actually, water molecules free move around other. They're dipole, that's they're really good mixing stuff, like electrolytes.

Also, try measure water level glass measuring cup, notice kinda arcs up. called meniscus. actually arcs attracted glass itself, glass wet, water.

On hand, mercury downward facing meniscus tends attract away glass. Well one example, criteria NY uses decide states impose quarantine affected number. Rump keep touting narrative numbers bad keep testing. 

They treating us like complete buffoons, keep proving correct. wait til see happens Biden wins, Federal Reserve pulls back quantitative easing, stock market tanks.

""The fear Democrat/Socialist economic policies sent free market tailspin!"" -- Trump'n'clan Shit, IFR seems raising new studies. UK reported 1.1%, Spain seems around 1.2%, I've seen NY estimated 1.45% (even though calculation 1%). saying 1.6%? :( hand also means virus less spread thought. Good lord, hope hospitals collectively ignore send data CDC anyways. still get mask mandatory though. appears within two weeks get now. work theaters 1month 150 people gathering close space without mask. guess lockdown worked pretty well come on. Another note article, great say, lot demands hospital workers remain answered like overtime pay, valorisation new contract boost employment. may French people still pissed government here! also think extreme extroverted nature Americans downfall. Americans don‚Äôt ability sit quietly alone awhile. around people feed self worth. concept social distancing nice me. finally socially acceptable crawl back waiting line. finally socially acceptable stand within personal space there's plenty room stand somewhere else. 

Extroverts completely lost shit inability gather large groups socialize. idea us introverts feel every day normal American society ruled extroversion. OANN Fox also *fake news*^TM think? idiotic? find single example hard hit state country seeing resurgence? really think that's coincidence? Sweden UK declining? 

San Francisco relevant comparison. Nowhere say herd immunity *only* way prevent resurgence. Meanwhile, people stand water found wet. Unless frozen. Masks work pretty damn well. Even basic ones offer protection infecting others moderate amount protection person wearing it. 

Ignorance excuse, especially defiant ignorance. saying time, we're getting stupider stupider feel bad all. wanted sense, mean happened you. world going hell mean can't enjoy personal life going.

Me personally, hate this. pandemic made realize I'm much active social person realized need least friendly conversation daily tasks every day. bright side, I'm buying house! need around people fix up, fiance keep sane key question meat processing plants act super spreading locations. why, ski areas same.

The COVID19 virus active temperature around 4C transfers best cold dry air. worst  believe it!

I think SF‚Äôs large (non mask-averse) Asian population one reason we‚Äôre well. 

I used think mask wearing overkill, I‚Äôm thankful it. Fauci hangs globalist depopulation proponents racists.  well one shows half people scanned multiple countries including asymptomatic carriers permanent heart damage. 
Due fact learned lungs get fat embolisms covid safe assume people's lungs never recover can't get rid globules lungs they're there. want link study shows fat globules lungs. Lung damage like 80% cases obviously somewhere else others though. 
unfortunately statistic neurological damage prevalent would hope. 
to clarify decent amount people get lung functioning back affect much mean lot won't. Also heart study older population air affect younger people fact high demographic terrible makes suspect bad another demographics well Dr Fauci deserves never morons darkening door (as I‚Äôm sure preference) yet nevertheless, persists.

In fact, it‚Äôs overdue start updating tshirts bumper stickers to: ‚ÄúNevertheless, Persists‚Äù

(Etsy Sellers, you‚Äôre welcome) understand scientific opinions work. say one thing Tuesday opposite thing Wednesday. true based two different days data. 

Science weather forecast, things change drastically based current trends data. weird thought process shows truly stupid sociopaths making rules. Obviously want us die. much stopped surprising months ago. still surprises can't comprehend people going sit wait die peacefully watch 40-60% people around us fall ill, call sick, go hospital, die rate 10% hospitals become overwhelmed.

So think humans ants. we'll get stomped divert around bodies without losing stride. Fine. Whatever. go assume hospitals, businesses, states also continue business-as-normal without setting self-interested policies mitigate damages, causing spread slow simultaneously prolonging without able eradicate absence greater governing federal body, unforgivably naive unintentional, outright genocidal intentional.

A lack self-awareness level--the ability think kill 5% population without people noticing, taking action protect themselves, causing greater economic societal consequences--is extreme, think traditional sociopathy explain it. explanation straight brain damage hate humanity. posted sub? gets back insistence literal six-day creation. created internal narrative church intellectual elite created false theory (evolution) order free moral accountability God.

But immediately see got virus died...

See mask!? See covering nose? Yeah... that‚Äôs how... 
üò∑ Wtf talking about? saw new information morning legitimate questions. Fuck me, right? important fruitful right individual freedom.

I think main problem think ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù really hasn‚Äôt eroded much anyway, important people‚Äôs lives. Also can‚Äôt seem try prove point without twisting people‚Äôs words.  flu shot may increase chance getting coronaviruses. took increase noted title posts /u/Scaremasterjoe last week, took average that. around 12.8.

Note said deaths reported, delay. dark people picture? spread other!  training exercise climate change crisis soon dealing with. one actually bit divisive one hand sounds like completely bogus study purpose supporting certain narrative hand findings logical common sense yes, wouldn‚Äôt true would even need study. reality. I‚Äôve never unsure path life. news good news. :/ Florida man arrested practicing karate kick swans. could better fall might save lives process  really AZ lot 920k tests? Accidental Swedenness joke. Neither teenage Swedenness. Well misunderstood paper shows then. 


The paper shown memory T-cells created previous coronavirus infections produce antibodies cross react COVID 19, yet know antibodies actually effective dealing know interaction warrants investigation. 


What saying tests antibodies induced specifically deal COVID 19 cross reacting antibodies already show high levels prevalence suggests effect cross reactive memory T-cells preventing infection body create specific COVID 19 antibodies anyway. They're enforcing distancing, informing people. V√§ktare authority much, that'd need ordningsvakt. I'm asking alternative hypothesis uk sweden. Surely provide one? laughed hard mental image comment brought mind scared cat. 

Thank you. Well think hard know exactly happens.

From one side think Italy way 1% lot unreported cases (and side know also lot unreported missing deaths). Italy population one oldest planet, countries lot ppl die 60 years old obviously lower death rate. side cures almost raise dead count. 

And know still know lot. Every hospital send data CNN. May be? Trump thought choice public health disaster economic disaster. chose avoid economic disaster. receiving end both. them, that's inarguable. saying NOBODY social distanced simply true. I'm seeing ""why?"" hospitals reporting efficiently. lead us circumventing CDC? make virus go away? neighborhoods New York, observed antibody positives 50-70% range, broadly across city number like 26%. Yeah isn‚Äôt fatality rate children practically 0? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs like 0.001% math required default management major, linear algebra

Are trying say simpler complex? want people jobs homeless? Yes, thank taking time explain Interestimg mentioned PhD‚Äôs specifically. Again, stats. keep pushing narrative though! #ShillThangz title clickbaity, research pretty good quality even controlled education/income. sweetie Trumps fault. logic, died whatever caused path bullet, gunshot itself. dunno assumed alive test, thank you! What‚Äôs this? new gop conspiracy??? want know litigation offered administration prevent going altogether. blatant abuse power stand for. gonna like middle school science project, making numbers along way dont wanna check plant day. headline belongs MOMA American able make mind, public needs hear dissenting medical professionals Fauci's peers beyond.  need know everything! Yeah 7-12 days... What's over/under Karen videos posted Youtube first 48 hours? understand hanging actually works? bed frame useless task. I'm also good health old, I'm going die rona. agree example extreme.

So mention armchair physicians people medical training. Let ask either used simply deaths anyone positive covid covid death?

My point us using technical training deaths counted matter what. Common sense says lead overcounting. saying wrong know investigations would take time money potentially little value.

But knowledge deaths counted let's say deaths undercounted make sense.  Yet surprisingly aren‚Äôt issues.. coincidence think Yeah, remember time people bought every roll toilet paper sight even though reason think would shortage. People act rationally. Recommending cloth mask could still easily led asshole walking store 10 carts N95 masks hoarding one.

And I'm necessarily trying argue right move make recommendation, trying argue least logic reasoning went it. I‚Äôm going Texas  source chart zoomed really see what‚Äôs going on. Yes deaths (and people) Europe US early days, changing.

I quoted actual numbers provided site yesterday. Europe‚Äôs numbers look better without Russia. 19% Europe‚Äôs total population recorded 38% European deaths yesterday. population Europe without Russia 602 million (still nearly double US) 284 deaths yesterday 3.3 times less US had.

And deaths lagging indicator. decreasing trend cases takes time decrease reflected deaths. much better explanation deaths aren‚Äôt low think (but pretty low compared US already) Europe limited testing. cult almost caused full blown outbreak South Korea? buddy Ontario said going Montreal end month. I'm jealous. hadn‚Äôt even considered would still present, duh. 
Thank you! long long term? flu 20 years ago. *still* coughing. Normally yes, unless equivalency proved i.e. work new purpose like worked original purpose - emergency approval, drug used immediately. there's way people disease would show symptoms spread it. testing testing criteria makes Vietnam feel bad us. Poor little murica losing another easy one funny enough, states following plan okay right now. ummm waiting for. deaths concerned lagging behind spread pandemic three weeks. words, want make public health decisions it. want make public health decisions prevent it. offense pretty useless... Answers like neighbors wear masks üòÄ

You need compare numbers known value assess risk. One known value flu.

The CDC website says kids (under 18), hospitalization death rates less flu. 
For adults (basically anyone 18 60), hospitalization rates higher flu specify amount. Here's link without Jeff Bezos' fucking paywall, tired supporting little  Media loves spin. Local news reported getting test upcoming surgery scheduled.  think they're running room Florida already... America dies would love read report. Time Google! dropped unreasonable gun control platform, wouldn‚Äôt problem first place  Feels bit surreal people who'd usually spam immigration memes us holding us kind role model. never fan handling personally though.

/Random Swede Nice hope get deserve infect non-idiots. what? gave two examples countries trust two examples countries would trust. mean opinion countries 4. 

I'm sorry offended discussing China every comment make. no, take vaccine say good. It‚Äôs blatant fear-mongering point. article posted every day week. Might well according sub, world burning doomed. y‚Äôall need get internet get fresh air, it‚Äôs going head. Germany it. rough back February we're single digit deaths days. numbers active cases sitting stubbornly around 6k, mostly meat packing industry.

This simply true. CA spiking due tourism easily observed utter lack travel days fact state exploding places tourists A) visit B) couldnt even find map. 

Your moral question nonsensical. two people go bar one wear mask gets sick, person still assuming risk going first place. maskless people sneaking nursing homes sneezing old folks sleep.

Honestly that's do, offer lot protection! It‚Äôs almost like wearing mask works something cannot throw families streets. can't let happen.

You know we're going let happen.  study done 100% observation. come conclusion observing. 100% agree. add getting tested upcoming surgery according local news. I'm starting think US government one giant mecha robots stabbing head tries swat away intruder Count philippines in. need beat 1918 Spanish Flu's record. mean, went strike time, wouldn‚Äôt outcome same? can‚Äôt punish everyone else can‚Äôt school. take away teachers‚Äô pensions, strike that. fire all, watch department education sweat aren‚Äôt enough teachers now. 

But requires lot commitment teachers. faculty would also help. Unfortunately going lot workers already tough getting abuse. things seen sub else disgusting, makes really angry. 

Now biggest supermarket world underpaid workers host shitstorm.

Totally supportive decision though good them. think would happen, feel bad going get shouted put danger. Like really bad Thanks article. Typical parents: ""I anyone home, *need* schools (daycare)."" 

Meanwhile, teachers staff wondering *precisely* thing. 

Once again, American parents show little actually care education teaching. Duh and....? ""The state says target stay 10% positivity""

When goal, already either lost given up. I'm making claim. saying it'd literally eradicated. whole time I'm saying believe gave logic why. actual stance. everything I've read that's really unlikely happen, especially family owns home. could try rope something sturdy, like bed frame. require employees armed? there's gonna 10 million rednecks gonna violently ***pissed*** get told wear mask enter them, summer home.

Good Walmart though. Fuck red snowflakes delicate handle covering ugly mugs public. 'Greeter' even exist job. math better yet, eyes like true blind sheep. Truth always hurts. know. proved point, mate. bigger pp also. profit healthcare immoral. 200,000 week ago assume every single celebrity days fake hair.

When try make appointment places booked days.
So there‚Äôs nothing good testing Florida, either testing process waiting test results!! future Florida.

It's people's stupidity. President (who KNOW) absolute fucking idiot, says something, fuck people bother listen? 

You need mandate something people things. says free run 80mph traffic would it? Apparently many people would.

Quit blaming *other* likeminded idiots think yourselves. depends... talking big water? Ocean water? ok donald look excess death data afterward. looks like getting death expected. Oh Karen meltdowns Monday unimaginable freedumb fighters won‚Äôt happy this. 65% Walmarts places already require masks. signage already, need deploy it. happened pro-Swede, herd immunity redditors? get COVID?

I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. would never expected Walmart proactive care employees dealing whackadoos Sure can, old weak pushed aside die. That's we're heading directly towards. 

It's really difficult many people protesting everything trying save them.

I'm right Tampa I'm right middle it. Yay! I‚Äôm really concerned employees‚Äô safety. Trump ginned much animosity mask disinformation people actually believe mask users part liberal deep state conspiracy. could put orange thing ass? live Northern VA, start seeing guys black suit outside Walmart since last week. news: rain may wet.

Went Saturday things there's little kids, masks, coughing covering faces line in. Kids running everywhere, parents masked... Walmart's germ heaven anyway sheesh. 

Even hurting little kids others risk exposures? live Solitaire, explains I'm brilliant. Really sad people tried take seriously got rear ended politicians morons paying price. called science.

A user thread wisely pointed Walmart afford hire security. needs happen stores. Whether Walmart anyone's guess. even surprised store enforces masks. expect see dangling chins, see many co workers. local Walmart around 95 percent compliance door probably 75 inside

Honestly Walmart large retailers aren‚Äôt spread though

Family visits, church, bars tight locations long stay durations problems Stock popcorn, now, going make good videos. Cue? They‚Äôve never stopped running. timely. friend mine got tested two weeks ago yesterday didn‚Äôt results. happening over, time. It‚Äôs really academic point doesn‚Äôt matter. probably overcounting undercounting‚ÄîI believe undercounting, overcounting, neither knows true number. Scientists statisticians spend years trying determine real death count, much like done swine flu.

We agree major problem US exact, indeterminable number deaths doesn‚Äôt really matter big scheme things. Lots people dying, pulling away adding thousand doesn‚Äôt really change anything response US particularly poor. Haha. one. never hair long before.

We definitely masking social distancing protect risk don‚Äôt buy doom gloom sub either. sub tends cherry pick articles 35 year old dying push front page, reason writing articles situations - extremely rare. pasted community peer enforcement. people respond unless consequences. raising generation people seem think say whatever wish without consequences. mess still US entitled, wish attitude.

Now crisis educated Doctors Scientists telling things dont want hear, according narrative means trying keep down. President backing narrative publicly attacks experts ""Doom Gloom""

 
At point wearing mask political statement instead public health practice. Forgot /s? Probably everyone knows go get mountain dew whatnot . Plus theyre gonna need enforcers . Brb, headed Wal*Mart. Public freak people Walmart subreddits going explode quality content. reddit millennials continue embrace narrative without scientific backing merits mask wear general public.

You go! point point wearing mask aren‚Äôt going wear correctly. also gives false sense security dangerous wearing mask. don‚Äôt want wear mask stay far fuck away people...better yet, stay home. People wear mask incorrectly think helping aren‚Äôt. sure it‚Äôs rebellion, stupidity, can‚Äôt stand nose mouth covered. Ice water liquid. Oh please love fuck let start boycotting walmart. Please, get two drains America, walmart antimaskers, start hurting other, they'll less time resources hurt rest us. Oh, way worse that.

I coworker straight-up told he's disregarding social distancing/mask orders can. ""I care get virus, big deal. know anybody virus, I'm even sure real.""

He's going parties, visiting relatives, restaurants. pretty convinced point he's actively trying catch this.

Every employee save option WFH 100%. think coworker this? course not. Further, wear mask he's work - that, blame upper management, unconscionable, figured way work it.

On days WFH, spend 95% time private office door vents closed, window open. lunch coworker outside 10-20 feet us. leave sanctuary, N95 time - fucking around, especially dickheads like coworker building.

The mistake many people make treating outbreaks state level issue, state governments take responsibility mitigation assistance, clusters need viewed micro level. small fire cause blaze, will. Looking statewide positive test rates kinda silly seeing majority positives handful locations. locations positive rates important. Science also pretty helpful, IMO. pandemic. It'll politicize messages. He's actively trying stop right now. add this, want wear face guard that's fine judged so, provided also wearing mask.

Hmm... purport believe something principles come belief, belief principles writing.. wouldnt fake practitioner dont follow principles?

I'm saying people arent using identifying labels (e.g. ""Christians"" ""Sports Fans""), odd use label without substance follows it. Like whats point words meaning. refuses pay taxes owe pay schools? Hahaha, box mountian dews picked Roger different you, Daryl. feel like asking ""exactly far blender reach fingertips turn sauce?""

The answer ""don't."" Probably, story yesterday guy pulled knife employee stabbed employee. Sheriff's Deputy happened see basically blew guys head off.

The reddit joke they're going bury mask on. test less confirmed cases virus.

It's ever appearances, never truth. Facts science damned get flashy set numbers. ubiquitous theme guy. Nordics relatively freer presses (more disagreement Swedish press wherein reporters dare GASP repeated questions (aka journalism 101) [called ) much better pandemic results. Norway's state epidemiologist said: believes critical debate interviewed several Swedish media everyone asks questions things support Sweden‚Äôs strategy. feels like want support government strategy. Sweden going whole really much harder post read since I'd already reading interest/worry. I'll stop bad news stops, hey tbh last week starting slow down, thankfully. 

And listen talk? pretty objective gives good overview what's gone on. listen her, even listen talks. one Sweden's heroic people year reporting situation quite interesting. know forecasting model is? shaved completely 2-3 months ago, see would look. (Not handsome man already, baldness improve it). I'm 54 losing front hair anyhow testosterone replacement. would like escorted building  

Apparently familiar police. allowed enforce rules keep shoppers employees safe.  

And hell people denied food.  right safe  

And told, else.   y'all wear masks easy way  

It gives legal way refuse someone food, can't resist. hiring security guards I‚Äôve heard, also local Walmart using one door, pay less guards assume realize flawed rest too, ew This. feel comment much. 

COVID pointed cracks system, things breaking. economy used hold health hostage. 

This absolutely government, keep best. Wearing masks, washing hands, cleaning, voting. 

Good luck stranger! hope continue stay safe healthy. first lies.

USA - New Report coronavirus cases:

* Total cases 0

* New cases 0 noticed people POTUS side entirely unreasonable. get right thing. come wrong reasons logical jumping point. example: Wal-Mart requires masks resulting anti-maskers raving supporting smaller competitors. That's good economy helpful specifically pandemic must mental gymnastics get us point accept wearing masks. even trolling; truth. crazier White House looks, worse Trump.

At one point, seemed like Trump least acknowledged Fauci. needs say get Trump, let him. 14.7% April 11.1% June. Sure there‚Äôs pandemic things shut down... doesn‚Äôt change fact time low January there‚Äôs reason won‚Äôt heading back there. Gig jobs PAY LIVING WAGE.

It provides close median salary individual working full time, convenience working hours even pick work there. get fired job, easily start one gig jobs pretty quickly. It‚Äôs really awesome, something one could imagined 10 years ago ease getting job like taking part time gig job extra hours time. aren‚Äôt gonna get overwhelmed lmao. whole point locking first place could get supplies needed fight it. Florida. got positive test results morning.

Is terrorism part work waiting?

Nope. responsible employer stay home get negative test result go without symptoms long enough. go 26 days awaiting test result quarantined much time nothing. lot people still working means much time lost wages. complete shit show. Everything Walmart say, ""Look! We're something; care!""  mean, signs doors said months almost half everyone I've seen past month wearing one, so...? There's even person standing outside blazing heat doors, thought ensure masks. They're probably taking soon get inside. job allows it, dont see companies wouldnt keep WFH thing, saves company much money dont actually office. worker productivity increased dont wake up, get dressed up, drive hour get work. anti-maskers either wear masks suffer more. private entities barred acquiring data? violate HIPAA even based statistics?

There's way thought would actually work.. again.. worried (nonexistent) webcam? can‚Äôt wait Seth rogen movie never said virus can‚Äôt spread Walmart wearing mask. Sounds like someone little butthurt jumped conclusions mind reading abilities....

I‚Äôm saying bigger problems large gatherings normal social lives. study English language condescending douche time. Take fedora calm down. like outside become radioactive companys like ""come one. sun radioactive too. Get it""  live county? Lol Don‚Äôt forget NYC NE also went lot trying warn rest country.

The fact actually happened us soil already yet people still ignored everything makes worse... That's simply gonna happen live...I left Walmart even employees wearing lol mean I‚Äôve done marching band years MO never heard school this. That‚Äôs interesting approach. April 11 NJ.

We're great every metric imaginable, hear kooks south many people died virus first hit.

Nevermind happened federal response (who's supposed take lead national emergencies) nothing figment everyone's imagination. They've going brrr whole time. Pretty sure feds still intercepting large portion product. Oh, haha. Already there. Right feels like pits lower hell.  constitutional rights!

/s going learn till 4 digit daily death tolls. Mark words even two weeks morons saying Hispanic problem something. need send actual studies proving HCQ works? many bookmarked US, India, South Korea, Italy, France, India, UK.....pretty sure cat outta bag media finally admit works weeks ago? Yeah remember that.  Maybe limits far reopenings go. I've already managed avoid likes flu crowd borne illnesses simply due avoiding crowds living past decade. I'm also big gun person, that's far go divide.


That said, simple wearing masks listening guidelines could go long way bringing country grips virus much quicker. Regardless side political fence one's on. see many deathly resistant towards it. trying get people killed?

You‚Äôre wrong, still... wait Karen arrives... Keep us posted!  lucky enough local [these deliver locally using employees. N95s KN95s hands 8 hours ordered. apparently that's long wait them.

They also ship, obviously gonna same-day. I'd like understand existing tests work truly questions regarding accuracy. CDC longer control, see rate slowly going toward zero. (virtual) peak. 
from on, downtrends. Someone send Alex Jones anonymous tip now!!! careful wish for. 

You want Kim Jong Un Bashar Al-Assad someone explain almost 1k+ people dying DAILY basis people acting like everything's normal? people wearing masks see America compared countries still care?

Greed, cruelty, selfishness, corruption, deception. ideals. consequences putting malignant narcissist power. see coming voting rights stripped them. actually money, they'd least impose mask mandate. pride economics.  Feels like people sleeping what's happening Brazil.

But holy shit Brazil gonna hit 2 million week see ANYone talking it. Must love snow cold well. Gemans word it: Wolkenkuckucksheim can, old weak pushed aside die. That's we're heading directly towards. 

Ironically, many people refusing wear masks also sent around memes bashing ""socialized healthcare"" thing Italy getting hammered. stores believe could help, Walmart probably print life size cutouts Trump Pence wearing masks health ambassadors stand front them.

They also inexpensive disposable masks available hand free greeting. could also sell masks like ones worn Trump Pence next cutouts people buy. money made masks could fund free now, walmart stores went along whatever local state guidelines subject to. I'm saying putting security guard front may convince people put mask leave people know security guards can't anything make wear mask. suppose security guard employs another person shifting person getting attacked low paid store employee low paid security guard. hospital (UF Gainesville) begin receiving patients. fed problem. Although India's case need literal miracle control outbreak. resources tech culture. People poor can't afford stay inside.

California switched tying local property taxes state funding school budgets 70s 80s. much improvement, many ways hurt school system places like SF exorbident housing costs schools cannot afford pay teachers enough live community teaching in. teacher turnover rate SFUSD bad well.

I think one overlooked reasons schools funding problem things like teacher pensions absorbing large amount budget teachers admins. Ah, must've misunderstanding, then. Well, case, there's clear advantage using Swedish sources reporting Swedish intensive care, there's reasonable explanation Sweden giving many elderly intensive care!

Does trump even know CDC does? necessarily simple comment says, although agree points. level antibodies people quite low recovered, vaccines atm (including Oxfords vaccines producing) 2-3 times amount antibodies recovered patients, definitely getting vaccine every 2 months. Again, also ambigious say little 12 weeks 12-34 months) talking 1-3 years time span...  Bahahahahahahahahaha suuuuuure. Walmart lately? They'll fucking shoot employees wear masks.

... hate everybody. alot people think hoax they're immune Oh man, cannot wait see Walmart videos anti maskers causing problems r/publicfreakout lol Yeah, know, want abyss looking back me. offense. You‚Äôre kidding, right? media mouth corporate America. corporations decide give attention receive attention. media‚Äôs purpose inform people us facts. exists represent interests opinions corporate America long profitable us sent work keep generally quiet this. I‚Äôve never seen happen normal fluü§î Really? grandmother financially supported food bank homeless shelter Texas town ask dime efforts. know fact many people programs like exist sole purpose helping people. Walmart America Canada too? posting one too, makes whole thing clear factual timeline. like one commentary misc talking heads. Im talking individuals, politicians. Worst case scenarios: friend friend contagious three days showing symptoms, friend contagious four days later. saw friend one day guy got ill, potentially infected. Behave accordingly. Trump's looking reason fire fauci since started, yes bet projection. That's prime time Europe, posted that. It'll get bump Americans log in. know, it‚Äôs kinda like ‚Äúduh.‚Äù worries, course bad, one wants everyone wish already it. right, would net benefit world immune. aware decide get antibody test may reliable, use tool estimate reliability find regional anitbody prevalence sensitivity/specificity particular antibody test. http://covidtestinterpreter.com/ tests false positives continue take precautions, maybe less worrying reasonably likely immunity. Take care. mask orders locally Walmart go daily deliveries police doors since mandate. AZ still August 17. Though districts extended own. Wish son's would. Choose online start person Aug 17 online full semester. Aug 17 things heading early. Doesn‚Äôt matter lol, amputator spambot nonsense. Whether visit AMP link normal website, google gets exactly data. teacher? completely absurd parents choice send kids back teachers don't......my mom late 50's, nurse school 25 years, best health, lives dad high risk. People going die. lot people. terrifying. forget, Trump manages maintain power, we're year, too.

Next up: Trump announces ban fire departments. Fire, see, destroys coronavirus. RI, public school kids getting food ‚Äúto go‚Äù ‚Äî pick up. Can‚Äôt that? starts Monday, based corporate memo. Relax hell letting Democrats run government positive? might lead get infected, reduce value mask preventing spread someone else. one making point people gathering, like civil justice protests, less intelligent. That's non sense absolutely dehumanizing, pseudo-science used propaganda defend status quo oppression. gaps, even tight seal N95, protection. People need understand point alone one blindingly stupid things I've ever read. Provide source says children high risk covid.. they‚Äôre not! People die, sucks. majority people die unhealthy soon die anyway. don‚Äôt think solution stop life know disease mild I'm trying start I'm getting confused. know it? bro.. home depot broward (florida) point since April.

only limited number people allowed store mask pretend get inside... tossed fuck out. lines outside early months longer amount people store makeshift barriers prevent sneaking in.

dunno lowes. Neither reddit Really I'm disappointed NPR case. expect reporting. Stitt getting Covid surprise never wear mask sitting video conference either. 

Bad headline people around zoom meeting ( mentioned). Either way, report meet standards. agree somewhat. think likely scenario regard care human life, since deep-rooted every policy advocate for. even think wearing mask care others well-being. Thank goodness can't wait end remotely craziest thing read online today agree you...I live Italy still wear even outside even tho mandatory anymore, never know meet somebody...all us wear inside stores without complaining Trump Biden's new plan ban windows? come gatherin' storm

Pours little truth?

Where smokin' gun's familiar

song let loose

With bombed cars

Come falling stars

From heaven we'll never know

And nameless names

On misspelled graves grow tall

We're still screamin' Wailing Wall Im saying need evidence. know? thing people use back claims. let know lol God knows point. numbers mysteriously go know something Trump fiddling numbers think going now. state we've mandatory order masks public stores stores refuse enforce it. asked Walmart manager said many threats anger directed towards associates. want see people get hurt ignore people wear masks.

I hate admit store manager would probably thing. Protect workers let public fend themselves. oh love word chance. married American live healthcare lifestyle. glad I'm Canadian.  giving context came across article.

I could‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI found article‚Äù - doesn‚Äôt matter came across it. Furthermore, see edit I‚Äôm inclined think it‚Äôs bullshit? want understand it‚Äôs bullshit instead simply operating bias.

So call whatever want; don‚Äôt kind hidden agenda question. It‚Äôs completely transparent. still working

Probably bills pay. could wrong understanding employer needs provide accommodations anyone disability at-risk ADA. would legal come unless documented reason come really think impeachment valid hoax: (Jimmy Dore) kids (at least toddler) due some, NP ""retired"" due pandemic, trying find new one difficult. It‚Äôs going worse tomorrow, next day next.

The thing change vaccine herd immunity Correction important. room lingerin virus SPECIFICALLY N95 ON, little protection.

All masks equal. Surgical masks cloth masks filter virus out..... n95s do. air n95 screwed hear you! stopped reading Reddit listening 24 hour news channels really feel better. However I‚Äôm slightly masochistic came back torture.  Oh man, going great videos coming symptoms kept working days. Surprised removed that. CDC article states idea mean looking forward hold nasal swab Imagine 26 days virus well ""embedded"" 14 days! Even stops fraction hospitals reporting, helps stats sows distrust CDC's numbers. Well, person chooses, hunker own. can't stop kids getting education though. asked people see 1k deaths day treating like normal gave explanation. misinterpretation. putting numbers deaths different perspective. I'm sorry things suck right now. can't begin imagine daily emotional load.  best understand virus. wearing mask taking social distancing seriously.  I'm sure mask every time outside safety home. taking measures, drastic reducing exposure risk. 

When every right, feeling scared control.  Every time start feeling overwhelmed, watch video. [Prime Minister Imagine living area national response.  mom, sweats, talking everyone puts kids bed. 

After video, simply repeat ""I'm idiots.  I'm smart. I'm rational. I'm can. I'm going pick anger ball. "" 

Seriously, I'm sorry stressed. reality fucking horrible nothing help.  know alone. Ari-Rona don‚Äôt care. Corporations bare minimum saving face. It‚Äôs virtue signaling actually bringing meaningful change within corporations, unfortunately, mask ordinance actually helps keep people safe. doubt they‚Äôre keep people safe, that‚Äôs nice side effect Walmart. r/FuckYouKaren get lot fresh material  Welp worth arguing selfish, ignorant dumbass either good day. stay fuck away me. matter even test positive back log(again 7-10 days results), ones contact tracing. lesson would be? 

## Abstract

Background: Safety whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) COVID-19 pneumonia established two phase trials. focally dampening pulmonary cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve outcomes hospitalized oxygen-dependent COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patients COVID-19 pneumonia treated 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed 28 days least hospital discharge, compared age- comorbidity-matched control cohort. COVID-19-positive patients eligible protocol hospitalized, radiographic consolidations, required supplemental oxygen. Efficacy endpoints time clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, serologic responses. Results: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT April 24 May 24, 2020 compared ten matched control patients, six received COVID-directed therapy. Median time clinical recovery 12 days control cohort vs 3 days LD-RT (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time hospital discharge (20 12 days, p=0.19), intubation rates (40% 10%, p=0.12) shorter LD-RT cohort. LD-RT cohort faster radiographic improvement (p=0.03), even among patients high COVID burden. Serologic recovery specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, inflammatory markers occurred rapidly following LD-RT among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including 3-fold risk reduction time clinical improvement, observed following LD-RT compared matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy COVID-19 pneumonia. Given global availability radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts investigate optimal role LD-RT COVID-19 pneumonia justified. Clinical Trial Registration: sub fear porn. maybe warranted, maybe isn't. change fact basically hub reading horrible, end world, death america news. Lying mother fucker. store at? #2064 enforce goddamn thing sure fuck compensated it. old person maybe not. get sick, go hospital, coughing shortness breath get worse couple days, put under, pass away medically induced coma within 2-4 weeks. Better slowly dying cancer year losing brain Alzheimer stroke barely able talk feed clean wither away care home 4 years like grandma. Fair point WA State tested 8 days ago still results. I‚Äôm lucky work home still get paid. It‚Äôs mess. target one cities required masks.

It's quite sad watching capitalist better job protecting consumers government. clinical CDC version without added commentary - work every job though. cases workload ebbs flows people expected explore projects can't measured easily. yes privacy laws US prevent sort automated systems deployed. three options situation:

1. Lockdown
2. Everyone wears mask social distancing
3. Healthcare system overwhelmed, thousands thousands deaths

Anti-maskers would rather third option ""right"" face naked infringed. two problems here:

1. lot public behind curve news. new information comes out, they've started hearing ""old"" information. seems there's consensus bunch men suits arguing things understand.
2. lot people (especially reddit) act like ""science"" infallible, all-knowing entity everyone follow, idiots psychopaths would ever refuse blindly follow it. always going result big backlash people find ""science"" constantly mocked castigated following turns wrong. Well, group, CDC Fauci liars. right, would say WH better handle situation without CDC spreading lies.

And WH starts suppress data, numbers started go down, Trump group rejoice ""success"" WH controlling pandemic.

Finally, blame CDC Fauci main cause pandemic losing control, Trump finally able fire Fauci.

Mark words this. He's already leaving smouldering heap country next guy, what's one building? (try living here) never completely overrun US Oh shit. may need vacay reading covid. 

In back mind there's nascent suspicion republicans declaring positive part campaign convince their-believers like flu. I'm sorry say group GOP proven full liars number fudgers can't dissuade back mind creation point.

It tells wait see there's spate positive declarations conservative politicians, none anything worse symptoms head muscle aches. 

Feel free downvote. back mine generate twisted stuff. wish board attitude. tried self policing, work. country worse before. That's 40 years Republicans screaming government can't anything good gets childcare workers required get vigorously tested

You would need accurate testing instant results everyday. Anything instant still asks parents take gamble. tests exist? importantly, *this administration* ability roll many tests nationwide? *this administration* ability even desire open free clinics nationwide?

I think that's considering. throw hands say ""we tried"" couple months. people charge supporters made decision go opposite direction, aggressively.

*I* know possible, know simulate herd immunity wearing masks, republicans idiots community made minds decided spread virus.

So options keep toddler home possibly years, send socialize risk lives. 

There zero options within control. **if** common sense prevails here, per title. 100% certain are.  I‚Äôve lost track. horseman Apocalypse portend? 1000 cases per day like asian country politic expert also would claim reopen economy Careful now... complain Karen's much risk becoming ""Karen."" would fantastic Cool. 
What people people two different things.  Ultimateely American media's complicit causing country standout clusterfuck compared others.

Not complicit. I'd argue number one cause. much different would country (much less pandemic) media got rid misinformation, agendas, grasp ratings facts? already away greeter positions. Can't go wasting money elderly disabled. Anyone can't put boxes 4-8 hours day (depending close qualifying insurance) trash them. don‚Äôt think anyone ignoring problem.

Is argument young people getting bars, one else wearing masks? Yes, please boycott us! would love smaller crowds. like Memorial day Ozarks there. I'd personally err side caution schools, /u/kevperz08 correct saying prove anything one way another easily kids spread COVID. husband completely cut Walmart semiweekly shopping trips due people... somehow feel change that. fun thing do, people go maybe year so.

And say news you? think underestimate means thousands people come visit us drink year so. US Canada too? Guardian actually thinks plan. Doug Goofy shambles Costco major retailer? best buy? ""Freedom loving"" giant quotes I've never heard ""what dark"" before, love it! see comment removed. use banned word? Lol Same. talk curbside errands. friends state talk coming Florida ‚Äúvacation‚Äù. duck?? cannot believe people‚Äôs unwillingness see reason. ain‚Äôt year carefree beach vacay. Yup... 4 years work gone... working home watching son who's 3 going daycare school. I'm income wife damn near work... fuck supposed do? issue March want us out... üòî fucking hate year..... That's correct. % confirmed cases 4% US. don‚Äôt get it. Don‚Äôt know computer using phone government already them. post thoughts social media already government read mind. trying hide Soviet take get they‚Äôve already done shit job. Wearing mask isn‚Äôt going make difference. Facebook Karens going lose freaking minds sure. words, ownTennessee. know that. giving example average people come conclusion safe them.

I bit overweight. personally think would fine statistics say means sure thing would fine play safe. BUY BUY BUY what? Nice! Ugh Remember school shootings biggest threat schools?

This going dwarf that. feel contradictory anyone else? First told mask N95 would effective....then told wear mask, bandana, torn cloth can. they're trying say must wear surgical precision else basically fucked? I'm it. continue wearing mask been. I'm it. hope actually enforce  thought government handling healthcare bad thing?? Oh look edge lord appeared. 19 years old? Don‚Äôt socialize. 18? Go school. flu already hits hospitals winter.

Additionally, Covid (in some) seem like common cold people want skip work sniffles spread more.

Add holidays people simply social distance get recipe disaster.  checked apartments website says central AC... Walmart open requiring masks? WTF? Oh gee, can't wait *strongly worded letters*. civil disobedience called here, hold breath. say that. Walmart see sack load people cut costs ‚ÄúA lot people showed didn‚Äôt really think twice whole virus, won‚Äôt happen us, know? believe around least 300, could closer 400,‚Äù Cole Wood said. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, think even once, guess. US already 2-3 million doses produced... news ... Walmart Reportedly Becomes Ghost Town Walmart west des moines actually security guy front... sure policing masks though already mine people front me. Inside lot of...neck masking going on. Lest anybody think entirely pure motive - fiance manager. Close half staff quarantine, overtime costs rest roof.

That said, hopefully start trend. Somebody first among major national retailers. - proper mental screening education - think fair say find candidates genuinely accepted risks (for whatever reason). 

Set bar high enough, too, ethical qualms people bravely would intentionally self expose. 

By education - I'm talking multiple classes worst doom gloom + explicit videos death virus find.  freedom mistake Orange county CA time. report comes in, comes in, taken. trying confuse people. matter, end cases still real still crowd hospitals. PLEASE start protest ‚Äúmake drunk driving legal‚Äù way let dumbass know stupid are. Wait, havent been? CDC using ridiculous number taken discredited study, two days ago.

As recall reason discredited John Ioannidis estimated *lot* people Covid people thought, made IFR lower people saying time.

Now months study, people saying number Covid infections? higher lower thought? expire fast? seems silly. Yeeting one Karen time. Yeeiii !!! karen content !!! used like idea getting house country nice little town since that's grew up. last four years seeing many unfortunately bogged loads morons like you? I'll pass while. crowd fucking entrance. like fuck point everything one person within 2"" slide past, comes contact everyone. 

what fuck self checkout still used for? entire damn city touching shit self checkout clean every 8 hours more. horrible way die though least r/publicfreakout good amount fresh content.  found single Menards I've (six) Wisconsin allowed anyone without mask. security entrance gate send people without mask service desk buy one ask leave. Menards one taking seriously. And? comparison still fallacious.

Making issue ‚Äúrights‚Äù vs traffic laws logically flawed

Moreover, isn‚Äôt recreational spaces like bars.

This work necessity spaces 

At risk People like damn neighbor apparently prone blood clots didn‚Äôt know -which goes show happen anyone- go work. procure food family.

People fighting customer service workers, attacking them, spitting harassing asked wear masks.

There clearly needs oversight.

Educate governer issue.

This isn‚Äôt druthers personal liberty notions constitutes acceptable due process. 

This giving shit neighbors enough reduce risk little bit people aren‚Äôt forced choose able live see next year able work obtain things need.

And apparently people act like animals oversight. Ohhhh gonna piss lot people One single County Commissioner trying usurp power authority over/from county school board, knew could potentially get away it... 

I like Provo one bit. 7,000 15,000 positive cases reported traced GENETWORx Richmond, Virginia. company, Florida‚Äôs fourth-largest processor tests, said statement looks like Florida Department Health reported single day, lab results collected course four five days.

So testing backlogged. really news. [archive link](http://archive.is/1vSPG) cannot access article directly. good news story. 

[OCs largest districts comply. likely talking recent peer-reviewd study Phase 1 released yesterday happy wrong case! still concerned Texas. see. crazy official position would quarantine needed without symptons, really underscores need quick acceptable testing. would also say employers individuals use best judgment. health dept officially *require* isolate mean shouldn't. direct exposure briefly coming within 5 feet infected person outdoors, symptoms, pretty unlikely caught it. direct exposure prolonged close contact indoors, that's entirely different matter. shit. Yeah counted everyone know. 28 people. lot friends got wedding. None went hospital good. seem fully recovered. understand case everyone gets it. fucking time. someone dumb get position like this? saw that. 

It noted nobody claiming masks 100 percent effective either. saying masks don‚Äôt great job protecting wearer getting either.

This meta-analysis studies community use masks included review gold standard studies, RCTs, cohort studies, case control, cross-sectional studies, found reduced odds infection 6 percent only. means lots stories people wearing masks getting infected country recommends them, another doesn‚Äôt. sure reasons. Dammit get popcorn monday night. believe he‚Äôs first governor test positive. first announce anyway. take 100% population wearing imperfect mask

Absolutely. People talk Japan / Taiwan / etc mask culture played big role success far. suspect people talking proper mask wearing countries long enough see casual haphazard usage is; ""don't touch mask, eyes, phone"" etc followed lived.

Masks primarily worn stop infecting others. infected touch anything (on body) damn well please.

If want smoke go away people smoke mask hanging off, itchy move away scratch away etc.

Around people wear mask, big rise diseases asymptomatic phase wear mask even think okay i.e. every flu season.

Realistically virus contagious hours worried residue others mask pretty big decontamination issue get home. logical practical.

In opinion mask nazi's helping think real objective. way grammar nazis really ""fixed"" language.

(Unfortunately Japanese style mask wearing takes several countries going find flat disgusting \[to me\] sound people honking swallowing snot winter something live tradeoff). time. Good thing they‚Äôre sending nurses Texas nurses done everything. public doesn‚Äôt care people flood floors getting infected. China: hey world, Covid thing really bad, might wanna take seriously. 

Italy: yeah agreed, military trucks hauling bodies away pretty sad scary

US: RULES BIOLOGY DON‚ÄôT APPLY US EXCEPTIONAL. People think better hide symptoms. Unless replace paycheck, would expect anyone give 1000's dollars, err side safety. Especially young age group expect survive this. could convince take day two off, hard convince take longer unless already know covid. give people perspective - California almost 40 million people, twice many Florida. California also mandating masks starting close again. Florida heading full speed this. Darwinism finest. work bouncers get getting back work. think like stir shit. life boring gotta spice bit. whole summer's worth time spread keep going. one military stand own? lame, overused insult that‚Äôs even hurtful whatsoever. Bravo can‚Äôt parts US believe science. wearing mask anti-maskers? Honestly hope ‚Äòfears‚Äô true suffocates worse. Sorry what? English here, elaborate story please? Facebook Karens going lose damn minds. r/conservatives - greatest injustice since holocaust!! feel threatened! forget potential brain damage! Nbd tho. Makes wonder jobs relocate help fight actually completely accredited Covid-19. No. Jesus State win train wreck contest? Texas Florida? made clear offer accommodations

you offer *appropriate* reasonable accommodations, unique (although many people may basic problem thats solved way) everyone. *an accommodation*. 

get head. 

to dumb thick skull, imagine situation: metal detector, client comes they're paralyzed wheelchair. *cannot* ask get chair *or* turn away not, dont get fondle everywhere think reasonable accomodation either. Whatever figure out, suit specific persons needs without needlessly humiliating accomodation reasonable, i.e reasonable based situation. telling go another casino denying entry entirely, reasonable example. reasonable goes ways, direction. 

they dont *have* accept insufficient accommodations dont offer good enough accommodations actually accommodate simply get sued lose. dozens alternatives kinda accommodations needed sensitive/ burnt skin veil masks stay face skin start top head.

did know top head skin burned irritated? 


sooner later, somewhere, someone gonna show cant wear type contraption head someone actually tries deny simply make person rich. 



and went court theres real chance would inadvertedly get casino shut down, social distancing enough already it, isnt enough arent (and substituted masks) theres solid chance casino would simply closed safety concerns, will. haha judge rules social distancing appropriate accommodation this. I've never seen one DFW ones I've to, including one kind sketchy area. We're decidedly suburban now, surprised Claiming masks communism. to? Nahh know something productive time. think we're get masterclass properly wear chin mask. love this, I've seen people beat system pull masks take they're in. Good luck Florida suspect huge range options quarantining die and... Whatever planning do. equip N95 masks safety goggles. comment showcases ignorance narcissism. seriously understand point wearing masks July 2020 already?

Sorry hear dont care humans community.  Jesus. Part wants drive Walmart, open camping chair, wait see happens. 

Watching anti-maskers get knocked around stupid, something would find greatly satisfying point pandemic. RIP underpaid workers going enforce this.

The cops park patrol cars Walmart parking lots Monday Essentially, Dr. Ezike explained anyone passes away testing positive virus included ""If hospice already given weeks live, also found COVID, would counted COVID death. means technically even died clear alternate cause, COVID time, still listed COVID death. So, everyone who's listed COVID death mean cause death, COVID time death.""¬†Dr. Ezike outlined.

This article says. even clearly state COVID deaths counted. quote talking hospice that's it. writer make mistake assuming means cases counted like this.

Do link something states counting method applies Illinois clearly? mean, AZ months increase testing capabilities didn't. I'm PA got tested turnaround time 12 hours. friend NJ got tested ""long"" turnaround time 3 days. need 24-48 hour turnaround time, AZ's failure entirely unacceptable. No, ""like miracle"" Shit, curbside pickup delivery cool. Screw going store avoid it.  understand objection comment.

you replying like asshole.

What NZ, canada germany great. America's government run chemist? listening scientists? no. would like change things overnight?

I think understood comment either. 

go away everyone lost minds China supposedly hiding numbers, including fanta menace. he's literally exact thing.. Murica. work Walmart cannot back fill sure able too. That's bad üòè Absolutely. speed limits seatbelts. 


Same logic. much information title. important one - many cases today?

(for curious 10,181 cases, article)  going weird. Masks mandatory pants cut life selfish fucking stupid boot

Not combo worth life way. mention, probably harder identify wearing mask.  lol don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking Look Etsy selling patterns adult L/XL formed ones, look pleated ones fit wider range face sizes (i.e. expand 7""+). Many ""regular adult size"" fitted masks around 5.5"" nose chin beard, larger nose, etc, want look ones larger. Maybe go back high school stop acting like jackass. Trickle starting feel like warm piss. Show study backing asymptomatic carriers contagious. [There say What? become thing? Unless hits hard doubt he‚Äôll change stance.

If stays mild mostly asymptomatic it‚Äôll give ammo say see? It‚Äôs big deal  news March/april. Greetings Europe said black suits black guys.. wtf Thank you. wish every American decency. Stay safe:) death issue virus. permanently destroys organs blood vessels

Who saying made BS. Walmart near everything right ... first 10 feet front inside store. check everyone mask wearing going in, anyone refusing allowed in. entrances one side store, exits other. employees masks. Tape marks floor encourage social distancing.

+10 feet inside store ... many people pull masks noses entirely. see enforcement inside store all. here's thought people like witnessed first hand family members almost die untested vaccines like flu shot run thru normal proper FDA trials 4 years like every vaccine required do. like significantly decrease chances needing squeeze past someone

I'd like felt like that's actually worked out. Maybe people dense contrary follow rules, end people aisles overall due decreased efficiency still lots people going direction anyway. 

When scoot past 20 people workers aisle even need anything that's good. Iowan‚Äôs making joke southern Iowans moving Missouri years. Well, apparently able get test results &lt;24 hours taking week everyone else, that's really case far. impression already required. signs plastered front doors towns Walmart‚Äôs can‚Äôt enter without one. order shit online Walmart, go customer pickup area. bring order load vehicle without get out. glorious. Maybe 1 items order sort substitute/unavailable hassle free deal crazies. pull up, call tell I'm here, bring stuff load up. That's basically AFL-CIO is. unions part it. lot municipalities making city wide mask laws, thankfully thought already get wear face masks, really monday? Cant wear fresher one? kind spread fast wide hard protect anyone think. Potentially. *if nothing.* could 50k confirmed cases day month. went 1k 10k month. Another month uncontrolled, 50k implausible sadly. It‚Äôs crazy 6 months still don‚Äôt enough tests:(( subscribes /r/publicfreakout someone going pull gun 15 year old associate ""defend"" ""rights"" going national news.

Its gonna happen, probably multiple times. went Walmart late March Philly opening hour. don‚Äôt normally go figured aisles wide it‚Äôs easy maintain distance. limited number people store. People good masks social distancing. one lady stood behind close kindly asked step back, started cussing out. employee came immediately told her, look, follow rules please, backed off. Currently 7th day waiting results Alabama Ummm clear wear masks, distance gonna spread more. We're called Ca$hville nothing! 
Yea I'm 30 mins Na$hville.  now? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs different political opinion

It often though, especially person question holds political 'opinions' extremely harmful people power enact changes impact people's lives.

Politics meaningless thing opinions opinion matter. actual consequences holding shitty political opinions. guns, always always be. guns 26 days... FUCK

The test completely 100% useless point. jfc Karen kan starve.  strange would happening Trump president Obama was, since obviously Obama super secret Muslim. Logic. seems take issue fact funding JetBlue. 

They duty disclose that. Moreover, fits pattern political bias. can't take something itself. Basically, number things push reopening bias, shady things like disclosure. Even told basic errors, still went pushing reopen agenda using study knew flawed. That's Stanford investigating researchers political bias. know--I think DeSantis true believer, much cohort voted him.

We large contingent half political apparatus *detached* reality. mean, many people think Central Park field hospital coverup rescue mission save mutant mole people child sex slaves, hundreds celebrities arrested, executed, replaced clones arouse suspicion. What's one thing deny? said. Asked look one posts apparently much ask someone decided go ""BUT KARENS"" think EVERY ONE sick wants thing spead. said right there, though. death rate high. convince people question taken lightly death rate low? It‚Äôs impossible. same. helps hair already long straight fuck badly. actually looks good! even cut layers. I've never layers before. I'm going continue cutting hair. I'm sure Great Clips survive without me. üëãOh hello there. I'm also Brevard. say one wearing masks good population pro social people here, saddened many people one Publix morning. committed troll? ask nonsense questions seek put issues vacuum like waste time? 

I say high degree certainty got work dealt customers day day out. 

A handful studies sent corroborate idea mask wearing indoors reduces volume ambient airborn virus particles.

He dealt people regularly asked keep mask on/over face holes time. 

We also data suggests severity infection partly dosage dependent.

It stands reason people patronizing establishment stand either increase decrease amount virus present choosing adhere proper mask use not.

Given constantly request people:

Keep masks 

Keep distance 

Wait turn enter lobby 

Limit number people tried pile 

Not touch things eachother 


We fairly cofident people patronizing business increasing risk unnecessarily.

Mask wearing part that.

Are trying play time now? I‚Äôd rather laugh let know stop pouring energy someone clearly doesn‚Äôt give shit thinking issues. Karen's everywhere : ""Let sing song people"". It‚Äôs end month. It‚Äôs also got long list exceptions. it‚Äôs start.


 Ala. (WBMA) ‚Äî Wednesday morning, Governor Kay Ivey announced statewide mask order place, effective 5:00 p.m. Thursday July 16, 2020 ending July 31, 2020. someone inbred wearing mask, projecting consequence inbreeding? rUK rest UK? I'm rural Ohio much here. I'll bet money ""nationwide policy"" quietly dropped lose money every big box store around that's mandating anything. American here. exactly type person hate see represent us. Americans pathetic ignorant him, would embarrassed know personally Apparently bath salts cure corona masks recommended ""it hurt"" proven prevent spread whats point understand getting ""hysteria"" due ""hysteria"" anti-mask, anti-government agenda morons keep shouting ""thought control experiments"" ""oppression"" refuse wear mask shout anyone wearing one - reason cases. Right? hysteria byproduct hysteria. 


The definition hysteria being, "" exaggerated uncontrollable emotion excitement, especially among group people. "" think appropriate amount hysteria Covid. guess hysteria among anti-mask, anti-government, hoax conspiracy crowd. Sadly feel kill employees safe. make sit classroom 8 hours day students teachers ""safe."" I'm really sorry hear that. employer sounds like outlier me. Even ignoring liability risks, odd would selfishly worried employees getting sick, because, know... presumably need employees work? PA residents absolutely throwing massive tantrum work field truly impressed much ‚Äúwarping‚Äù going on. Things progressing 3x typical pace much red tape cut internal corporate bureaucracy. Get couple people give thumbs go project instead standard 12 month review cycle. 

I think vaccine end 2020 early 2021 completely possible, scale deployment afterwards. everyone needs start calling dick noses. don‚Äôt know ever realized Walmart option people shop. said would've happened new deaths reported normal pneumonia others, got downvoted hell, are. Quick compare levels confirmed cases America Northern Europe!

Hopefully learn something. implemented like 3 months ago like rest world wtf starting  outdoors someone infected mean you‚Äôll get infected. look protests. quick regard personally attack people simply providing data shows complete lack normal social interaction. Take care. feel employees. Minimum wage get yelled at, worse trying enforce this, people‚Äôs selfishness lack decency...beyond every reason pay employees better, ALONE, warrants composition nightmare they‚Äôll go [Chinese study showed outside transmission addition, helpful thought experiment hypothetical situation outdoor transmission real possibility. timeframe someone infectious, pass thousands people street. rate cases would blow much faster currently is. 


Obviously go something like mosh pit. Keep 6 ft. crowded urban setting, mask courtesy. might neck pull someone also wearing one. Agreed. 

This class war. seems racial racial tensions exacerbated class divisions, real root problem employers carte blanche force continue force workers dangerous, at-risk conditions pandemic.

I'd like add regarding media's role mess. corporatist media ones reporting this, thousands good journalists best, leadership aided abetted creation news ecosystem allows tens millions live faux bubble COVID-19 exist. is. don‚Äôt actual response yell profanities get emotional. 

It‚Äôs system results highest take home median income world. Claiming zero safety net flat lie. even safety net, people Europe US prefer work gig jobs relying safety net. Finding job used hard. it‚Äôs easy. Literally anyone get job pretty quickly modern gig economy. Far faster takes government, even Europe, send welfare checks. really great system.  Walmart NY hired additional security face mask required. think good idea least first weeks. Username checks read seemed reasonable, exception person cannot wear facial covering actively providing obtaining access religious worship, though wearing face covering strongly encouraged.

A lot Europeans say States I'll use often talking Europeans think saying American annoying continents Americas, states probably worse, imagine basically countries states provinces.

I think real problem picked kinda dumb name country.   love it. feel like enjoy schadenfreude one. LGBT community gets dragged everything. It‚Äôs really shame mean lived state mandatory masks public already true, needed mask shop walmart since June, one turned away, law. basically applies batshit stupid states lots fat republican types like Arizona Florida.

Stay safe best beloved. Yes, majority mutations imperceptible/inconsequential work hospital used drink much water shift too. have, since start mask mandates hospital, adapted habits safety safety others well, I‚Äôll share.

If need drink shift (not lunch break alone) keep sanitizer paper towels desk/work area.

Sanitize hands, put clean paper towel down, remove mask using straps place gently towel without changing shape flipping around setting letting outside inside touch, sanitize hands again, quickly drink water (do talk, cough, try sneeze, don‚Äôt move around leave area), clean hands again, put mask back using straps much possible, discard paper towel sanitize hands again.

It‚Äôs pain ass, people department gotten sick ones take masks front coworkers think safe. method (that use lunch break eat/drink absolutely necessary alone confined space) working far. 

We get one mask per day ‚Äúreuse‚Äù whole day sanitary way think of.

I think advocate children later life bringing selfish urchins. They‚Äôre parks. Close indoor buildings, require masks near people, throw doors wide open.

[Disclaimer much truth statement. Fuck...smh Ew creeping someone's history cringe I‚Äôve gotten point part sub come anymore linked get conversation going possible policy recommendations. start 6 feet thing replaced stay far away others possible. appears COVID19 may stay air 16 hours, people disturb air walk threw it. precise chaotic effects disturbance almost impossible predict general would say away someone someone else general safer be.

Anyway people kind ran low effort comments, posted fluff ego rather problem solve collectively. Still early call win. god mom gonna go crazy feel hard, older brother kind jockey doofy, use make fun accuse making words. also avid reader much like parents. Depends part country you‚Äôre in. $23 hour Kansas single adult leaves quite bit disposable income. 

My monthly expenses $1600 that‚Äôs $2000 month whatever with.

Now still depends definition ‚Äúextremely well‚Äù people it‚Äôs could ask for. plan Trump re-elected cost, regardless people who've lost lives become sick. downplayed virus called hoax. first nail coffin know supporters ain't brightest. plugged fingers ears, shouting ""la la la la"" Dr. Fauci tried inform virus destroying country supposed lead. Downplaying ignoring virus plans Trump end day everything re-election.  Yeah point cut out, kick force No, racists subset people disagree me. felt great disturbance force, millions voices cried terror... would three weeks shutdown happening gonna keep going ..... Pretty sure minimum wage walmarts $11 now, they're working way still.

It's still low, far grocery stores/etc unskilled retail jobs pay. exactly point contact tracing, though. call host see invited, call people see came brought anyone else, call people, etc. probably get 100% everyone, get lot. oh explains act way. deficits doubled 2016 2019 even Covid. 

And tax cut period. benefiting Waltons would free. Getting bounce idiot Karens day name public health? Sign fuck up. Oh, like Peter Navarro wrote Dr. Fauci (wink wink, nudge nudge).

-The White House dick noses. McConnell power necessary reelection neoliberal may issues beating. That's analysis anyway. fucking time. Last time went local Walmart saw family 8 (mom 7 kids age 11 under), none wearing mask.. disgusting. live Oregon's high desert so... Yeah. sole reason Australia midst second wave. Right virus eradicated, 10,000 idiots attended BLM protests Melbourne took virus back public housing towers around state, virus growing exponentially unchecked. Walmart NY Nj requiring masks like 2 months there. seen like two people masks on. bet that‚Äôs gonna go well unemployed bouncers bars nightclubs need work, seems like logical fit. np. great day!  Elon front line moment also think wearing pants choice? bit insensitive people

Well, USA we're discussing. name dismissive others is, like, peak America. I‚Äôm Pacific Northwest tested last Tuesday due couple symptoms. Eight days still results. I‚Äôm lucky work home, others lucky. absolute shit show. money shorter life expectancy

Sadly apt description U.S.  mandatory begin with? CCP step I‚Äôm also Louisiana confirm status state full morons. There‚Äôs also meth labs Texas Florida US, US world. thanks hate ""I look ways crossing street refuse live fear!"" Ya, could see definitely real too. Classic example American media stupidity known two sideism. kind shitty publication gives idiot voice, opinion mattered? Ah, Jeff bezo's propaganda machine. official moron opinion matter put next fauci's anyone else's educated idea relevant matters. idiot wrong, needless say. Fuck fuck people support extreme stupidity. 

All opinions created equal! complete moron, like American public, would ever think otherwise. social distance life... even read article? It‚Äôs telling us wearing mask properly effective thing do. protection anyone mask hanging chin. common sense article. can't handle alone, cling anyone. comfortable alone avoid toxic people. longest time want alone. would date anyone. many abuisvie relationships this. Now, ok alone. Someone hurts get automatic ghost/block. take shit anymore. fuck virus mach appreciated born last year boomers. job essential, take safety precautions clients well myself. participated BLM protests. lump boomers basket, discriminate basis age, sex, skin color. Hi everyone! Given announcement several large retailers adding mandate regardless state local regulations, I'm working simple website keep track retailer policies. purely fun informational - politics agendas, list big retailers appropriate policies. like check out, go here: time add much info, help submitting retailer policies here: Thanks! protesting police violence Spit throw usually going kill though  made little difference.

Sam Adams closed beer garden Boston many people state making hard continue safely fucking time!! much younger healthier population, quite honest. Stitt recently Wal-Mart.

(evidently know link it. Ugh.) mean Oregon trees and....ducks? midwest might implode humiliatingly deficient unimpressive person Kushner is. Trump keeps assigning tasks hysterically unqualified, like resolving trade disputes China bringing peace Middle East, Kushner's first stop Amazon check best sellers given subject. experts government devoted entire careers issues decades institutional knowledge approach them, Donnie's gormless son-in-law gets nod, that's country run right now. Key word: *also*. door greater Walmart last week. I‚Äôm ‚Äúhealth ambassador‚Äù gave special name tag, stuck outside 100 degree heat told make sure people wear masks. worked 5 hours straight break black ass shirt heat relief. Went lunch came back rest shift get bitched took bathroom break. Walmart gives 0 fucks employees. Unfortunately, no. current employees. get ignored bitched at. They‚Äôll report news outlets instead, would WH expect bunch people feel completely abandoned play game? Probably they're able differentiate useful information discard fake useless information act accordingly.

I'll take healthcare information healthcare professionals, random friends Facebook. I‚Äôve make conscious effort remember wear mine since I‚Äôm still used Better late never suppose. Right, trying say post. Still, cutting CDC feels shady. Actively encouraging infect leaving us fucking die. Well that‚Äôs already happening sooo NY here. walk urgent care place get tested free appointment. longest time I've heard getting results 3 days. Sometimes 1 day. couple months ago things crazy here. expect lot rascal pileups. think smarter avoid people general. met people? We're absolute worst. Don‚Äôt forget r/peopleofwalmart Thank walmart...now time target get board! possible way state state approach would work one traveled everyone listened. HAHA.    Socrates OG sea lion. Literally killed it. order Ministry Truth. anti masker freak outs popping everywhere I‚Äôm kind excited.

Insane people get laughed across world still think they‚Äôre right Still, think amount people who'd probably least try coughing would enough say no, I'm decently healthy 24 year old r/ihadastroke Yee-hawdists. mention people refuse wear mask ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù told to. People literally acting like 12 year old doesn‚Äôt want something parent told to. That's stupidest comparison I've ever heard. Sooo gonna show employees wear what? Lol employees half customers wear nose. Counted 8 Walmart employees mask nose 10 minute trip Walmart weeks ago... mean use US method ignoring problem? Menards enforcing mask-only longer big box know, even required. Dear Walmart,
Good luck that.

Sincerely,
Florida interesting note took Walmart 65% anything actually something.

As 65% vs wanted do.  like China Russia. wATer VApOr! seriously affected 130,000 people far. Laugh long hard.

Get snacks there. gonna goooood. might partake brand spanking new summer activity well job used hard. it‚Äôs easy.

Lol get fuck out. cresting 15% unemployment. Gig jobs PAY LIVING WAGE. person swoops take job puts children risk contracting virus?

Yep. Pretty comfortable using derogatory word person like that. circumstances, too. I've also got morals. landlord tries evict leave peacefully. Force go mostly closed courts. I'm Canada, town thats relatively small big (100k+ population) found 40 new cases days, *instantly* got it, masks mandatory every public facility city, fact dumb asses U.S. (and also Toronto fucking reason) raging certain private businesses wanting keep people safe, even government (which should, yknow, Trump, etc) mind boggling.   already thing? Walmart let anyone without mask months course, shop Wal-Mart, wear finest fineries. absolutely *shouldn‚Äôt* possible acceptable, unfortunately Republican Party power right back president matter atrocious behavior. They‚Äôve made clear matter crime, they‚Äôve got back. OMG get sick look him. Sending love USA. Really wish Germany right Somehow also recently got talked buying 1000+ piece domino set domino rally type shenanigans. spend lot time picking shit up. might part problem to... jesus, going about? 


Your first response read wrote? 

Ok, I'm play game believe meant ""what original comment wrote"" here. 


I responded seeking clarification comment based reply comment directly replied to... welcomed thoughts willy nilly racist term applied people, since entire point original reply thread!

&amp;#x200B;

Your specifically responding comment, person's. 

My comment? original comment (even say I'm supposed believe meant original commenters? Confused yet? right racist card.  mind majority BLM protestors/supporters non black folks.  problem.

You called comment, one specifically responding to, racially charged **VERY said something racially charged least wondered someone would go ""right racist card"". Frankly, said irrelevant point, responding you. 

At point, I'm like woah dude, way base. start providing quotes confirm we're talk apples apples. reply gibberish seem addressed lack quotation intervening irrelevant comment. 

And then, THENNNN, line beauty back issue hand. unreasonable point saying everyone protesting BLM ""stupid"" fairly racially charged least?  claimed unreasonable leap, want know why. yet responded wonder is...

You're like, Ohhhh bad, meant something else, answer unrelated questions.  


Like What. The. Heck (I really wanna say bad words, sub ban it). 


If actually following along reading comments I've made limited thread, know NO, believe calling supporters BLM stupid racially charged. ESPECIALLY reddit post regarding article explores correlation smart stupid people comes respecting covid19 measures.  


What think racially charged comments people like immediately see begin denouncing anyone share point view. 


As think reasonable leap:

1. BLM supporters races, assign value people, assign races... therefore.... race issue. 
2. comment controversial section Reddit... response 13 year old trying incite reaction people, 40 year old Russian getting paid slide board, could 20 year old karma chaserlooking funny could legit racist pos. 

Personally, perceived karma chaser looking lol's responded way original play race card game out.  


As last yet responded wonder is... 

That's likely result failure make point end... 


So going answer mine?

* people called add racial divide needlessly? 
* think calling people racist blanket response constructive? I'm Lancashire number people wearing masks supermarket risen slightly something like 1 100 1 30. law hits expect 50% mask wearing unless staff member door barring entry. ""who sets rules"" argument morons immoral pieces shit. Nobodies good ....To ""Everything"" wrong. they? Exactly, facetious argument, mask requirements pandemic thing plight Jews Nazi Germany. isn‚Äôt convincing. 

Here‚Äôs good article may want read - Thank job watching patients! elaborate? asking question know answer? [NSFL - worry refrigerated trucks get fine everyone, government control, provide tremendously beautiful covid statistics ever seen. Yeah like providing armed private security sitting door demanding mask enter. huge corporations afford pay security themselves.

I‚Äôve symptoms since July 1st. Took test Tuesday July 7th. said would 1-3 days. I‚Äôm day 8 waiting results. Everyone saying ‚Äúit takes 48 hours‚Äù whatever obviously waiting results passing false information on. think today going record breaker.

edit: maybe  Hmmm..at least gun, death quick/instantaneous.

I truly think (or anyone else) would want die (very) slow death COVID, lungs basically filling superglue muck there's venitlator jammed windpipe trying keep alive - failing. And, oh, BTW, none loved ones family hold hand happens. can't even hospital you. TOTALLY slowly drown goo.

I can't think worse way die increasingly able get oxygen. That's probably single worst way go.. last 2 seasons absolute shit. Hell writers even apologized screwed writing got caught Star Wars buzz. people even like Star Wars movie. Honestly point onion seems realistic actual news. Access better education likely leads better able try find truth, rather blindly accepting propaganda.

Plus, pretty ignorant put everyone risk bored need haircut... Teachers babysitters neither they're damn kids. imagine isn‚Äôt easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. 

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can‚Äôt help care like usually do, volunteers aren‚Äôt allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don‚Äôt anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don‚Äôt even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

The highest risk also negatively effected shutdowns. Shoutout #peopleofwalmart - - - got fresh content weeks!! Ayyy Probably around September October high risk medical workers towards end year entire population. would damn happy quick seems like could be! Sounds like better require masks places would point getting tested results took 26 days. it‚Äôs embarrassment. Swedish people denmark often seem like get extremely drunk low amounts alcohol. Mostly younger people joke usually funny, people mean. Tbh. Danish youth probably begin drink less instead finding cool, able hold much liquor doüòä

I've never heard anything really good front, revolves around swedes holding liquor general, like swede asks light beer, serve glass water never hand condom drunk Swedish guy, mistake chewing gumü§î settled period trot series papers establishing piece glue connects conclusion.

Further complicating matter long ago decided best way respond HIV deniers starve oxygen rather respond them. Responding always made entrenched. craziness spreads like infectious disease too.

But make mistake: today, PCR gold standard technique identifying presence particular known genetic sequence sample. tests measured that.

To extent PCR produces ""false negatives"", either process error sample actually sequence -- means really false negative test \[the question whether person infected pathogen separate question\].

For respiratory swabs, easier think way might swabbing someone's skin (presumed need confirm) fungal rash. manage swab skin run swab rash -- around it, might pick fungus.

A respiratory virus invade every cell respiratory system -- would certain death. could active lungs without active point sinus passages. case, nasopharyngeal swab lot like swabbing fungus around, on, rash. workers Wal-Mart barely wear already, care telling customers to. create anti-matter anti-intellectualism? He's basically begging Ohioans take seriously one last time state turns Florida.  I‚Äôm saying severely medically impacted situation, find alternative stay safe without triggering anxiety attack.

You‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll starve then!‚Äù pretending I‚Äôm trying punish you. behavior would expect 4 year old couldn‚Äôt ice cream breakfast, grown person chronic medical condition wish could ignore. 

If don‚Äôt want situation get worse, public health *or legal perspective*, wear mask public find another way get groceries. everyone does, *no need* legislation, won‚Äôt play along problem increasingly strict regulations. employees paid enough deal influx Karens. maybe last call drinking indoors? air conditioning season ( i've they've literally everywhere ) plus japanese used wear masks sick, mostly winter, probably something weird even wear summer. saved cold season could backfire hot season. I‚Äôm sorry, guess need start paying attention parts US. country allowed wear mask store??? thought people complaining people wearing masks, street something. People really allowed wear masks wal mart before?? places 'did things better' still cases.

Yes, zero cases much cases overwhelm health system.
Germany example last day 1000 new cases two month ago.

And yes, also meat packing factories shocking outbreaks (seems like global pattern) course everything perfect, working tracing App, enough people wear masks (and idiots like elsewhere) enough testing capacity find contain local hotspots.

The normal life back still many economic sectors huge problems (e.g. tourism, entertainment business) people feel like end world. really weird, shop mostly Kroger since March maybe 50% masks customers. Saturday? One person sitting entrance pointing sign handing masks demand, 100% compliance.

I blown away, since live conservative area. fuss, bullshit, everyone put damn masks. location only, though. Passed kids part fucking bouncy house way home. absolute failure leadership fucking corporations taking steps protect people federal government. Like wtf.  It‚Äôs sad people beg money go fund pay hospital bills America. live right state line KC, MO people seriously furious everything else woman does.  trying best. tried comment people calling around comment instantly deleted ""incivility"". 

Ahh Midwest garbage. Kinda hot actually. Hopefully expect everyone position relatively little money least Nah correct, much acceptable southeast. problem me, anecdotally, see people New York going beaches Florida weeks wearing masks flying back NYC. talk stupid Floridians are. think parents stay home work babysitting kids, consider privileged Wtf already mandatory? live Mexico masks mandatory public months now. expect data falsified moving forward? look forward viral videos FREEDUM LOVIN‚Äô ‚ÄòMURICANS loudly telling us rights. People 80+ years old like 1 20 chance die it

In state, CFR people 80 higher **26%**. insane. MAGA hats even made America? ""Spanking old-fashioned. new S&amp;M club, cough!"" generally nursing home workers paid like shit overworked. /r/HailCorporate understood headline. also know physicians bring anxiety/depression card every disease know little. Parents aren‚Äôt stupid,

OOOWEEE Yeah totally makes sense graduated one best schools country, graduated summa cum laude, join military due lack opportunities private sector generic degree. 

I'm damn impressed I'd stop chat literally afford time.

Although parents called police department seeing kid rioting looting news reported told right find bedroom. pretty awesome book.  There's rationality here. death cult. been?

Really?

The ""I tested positive potentially airborne virus"" *breathe* 

is credible, would fucking say it?

Direct, fucking clearly direct, clear *why would say make scared, yknow threat* potential juror. 

You 250 million morons, fuck cares like like, like.. Xtacy kicked like     whoaaaaa! apparently temporary hero, still essential I‚Äôm sure.  1.) Austria, US

2.) know virus real. also know flu something.

It ridicolous claim life return normal, see normal live pretty much every day, even now. live newfoundland labrador east coast, we've reopened bars restaurants reduced occupancy, we've 1 positive case past month half essential worker went Texas, masks never mandated here. Jesus Christ. graduate student I‚Äôm completely capable making decisions. think irresponsible university allow in-person classes I‚Äôm frustrated ‚Äúchoice‚Äù give us incomplete. haven‚Äôt got nearly information online classes work week today decide. locked either decision entire semester. would rather university commit online semester proactively make best give us ‚Äúchoice‚Äù without information peer pressure returning in-person semester. Yeah, helpful. Boy love good circlejerk that's sub become anyway, live rural WV 80-90% shoppers local Walmart already wearing masks  almost definitely wearing wrong then. worry 90% people see also wearing wrong. seeing people wearing feel safe self righteous really matter. also wash hands take mask touch face. swap mask gets moist. really matters since probably it. Even far higher chance dying parking lot work virus 99.5 survival rate. Stop falling fear trap. Denying efficacy masks ""heroic"" phase, adoption would much easier, proven unbelievably costly clearly disillusionment phase - seeing actual resistance official measures, phony displays like anti-lockdown protests April.

What's especially galling FEMA's [Training Manual Mental Health Human Service Workers Major originally published **1978**. Everyone federal level *at least* aware considered developing response. literally going say this. reliable going now... seeing longer CDC white house showing numbers... i'm betting covid gone week. Makes sense: Karens see Karen. *other* bitches Karens, them, never them. Oof aged badly would take months give 100 million doses. Florida never anywhere near NY terms deaths. That‚Äôs ridiculous heard happened second strain flu hitting area. strain affected children more. However, flu didn‚Äôt become widespread social distancing stay home orders implemented covid-19. reminds company talking using UV lights (non damaging UV-A/B Far-UV) directly inside lungs treatment. didn‚Äôt want identified probably worn mask !-) LEL meter constantly sucking air in, breath watch oxygen saturation mask increase exhale see dip. Ah yes, public policy deficient current administration private businesses must address pandemic themselves. ok, get now. would like sum ""the secret number"" seven days last week, backlog stretching well last week, days (probably recent week) off. assuming weekdays week ""almost evenly distributed"", take top 3 extrapolate add two weekends, hoping gives accurate value week. 

Can pose hypothesis? hope see one guy passion data talking another like-minded guy. think following might work. Basically, draw line sand work forward.

Assume tests June 30th close enough completed ignore June reported.

This matrix sums 163,994 tests reported analysis complete tests administered 6/30 (reported 7/1 after) 

Also, SUM(B8:P8) total number tests reported 7/1 after: 234,355 

If understand data Administered Test Date (ATD) Reported Date (RD) correctly, backlog close 234,355 - 163,994 = 70,361 today. Right? 

this matrix subtotaling could tracked separate tab, maybe nullifying data matrix IF($A25 Jun $A25 30-Jun,0,&lt;value Total Test etc. B7 could (SUM(B8:$V$8)-SUM($Q$8:$V$8)) - &lt;the matrix SUM(new tab B11:$P$25 Z100 nullified Older green row cells row 7 could use matrix minus x number columns left?

thanks spending time explaining me, really enjoyed work. 

Edit: P.S. would mean backlog hovering around 71,000 last nine days excuse know means one-size-fits-all rebuttal conspiracy theorist employ time win argument: ""that's want believe!"" evidence disproves point simply evidence nefarious agents part conspiracy. Portland Freddy‚Äôs madhouse! couple Vancouver ones 95%+ mask usage past couple weeks though, took long enough.  Uh... yes... yes is. entire reason hysteria surrounding COVID-19 10 times deadly flu transmissible. going use ridiculous levels hyperbole saving ""most first world handled fine"", death rates EXACTLY would looking simpleton. Walmart needs raise workers pay least 10.00 hour. guys go thru hell. hope safe. Sage advice Aunt: idiots commandeer everything useful. History also look upon Dr Fauci favorably suspect. Good one. dealt LA traffic though? Well know people hard time getting train back, I'm glad helping out! important thing missing whatever point making fact south mitigation measures place. thought hoax. Similar scenario me! company refused put place covid measures wanted drive two provinces, work , drive ,then work back home. cramping vehicle 5 strangers refuse wear masks.  wish speedy recovery, stay strong. Yea make $16/hr dont consider tests ""gold standard"", full sequencing genetic material even better. 1 million chances false positive something like 1 100,000,000,000,000,000 false positive. 

In Australia actually sequenced positive cases Victoria assist tracing. 

 

To give real world meaning, genetic material blueprint equivalent 35 pages 4 random letters (ACGU) specific sequence. example 1/3 Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream original American Constitution. done letter per letter find one two minor changes individual letters trace clusters / outbreaks. 

Unsurprisingly, 903 903 PCR test cases confirmed SARS-CoV-2

Note, tests give false negatives, especially first days patient yet high level virus system tests incorrectly taken. realize also Denmark doesn‚Äôt invade Sweden? There‚Äôs beer front them. Older people worse immune systems younger people, that‚Äôs fact. 

Do actually think older people never leave house? wearing mask really important you? wearing mask really life changing?

I know think it, put pride aside, you‚Äôll understand wearing mask really isn‚Äôt bad. match templates (primers/probes) designed isolating viral samples gene sequencing them.

Gene sequencing slow, tedious, relatively expensive. end process, end data file literally full string genetic bases/base-pairs make virus. far labs equipped run PCR and/or RT-PCR test labs prepared isolate gene-sequence novel pathogen.

Here's paper describing process COVID-19 particular: gene sequence assessed molecular biologist expertise area designing test probes. things consider: areas unique enough pathogen identify pathogen, short enough terms number bases need match practical manufacturing. Also, areas less likely change via mutation processes, etc.

After build probes, test numerous samples -- samples pathogen, samples definitely pathogen. ensure test results probe align known reality.

So, convince denier stuff (if able), next thing they'll come back ""OK, found virus. know virus [SARS-CoV-2 case] thing that's causing COVID-19 disease people - could harmless retrovirus!""

And respond.... well... thing corpses common tons virus lungs... samples came pre-COVID-19 stored samples virus...

And make vague claims correlation causation.

And reputable scientist lose patience [and frequently lose shit], grab thick plastic bag zip ties, choke life worthless -- indeed harmful -- denier.  Wdym? United States third world country dressed first world country feel like New York hit 100 deaths horrifying tipping point felt like long 700 deaths panic set in. started going really really fast. suppose expecting prepare 3 weeks? point picked two outliers.

Your first comment Northern Europe. picked two outliers group countries try prove point. aren‚Äôt realizing outliers....don‚Äôt...set....the...trend. widely available fall. Looks like Eddie Munster me.. need proof Trump one corrupt piece shit, ya go!

Tell we're still going able get accurate numbers somehow Yep, guy stabbed 77-yo dead 30 min. later attacking cop. mind-blowing mask worth killing over, apparently worth dying over. Crazy. thinking best time sell , record highs . Sell invest vacation real estate . said mr hankey Thanks info! leaks press conference, still important.

Everyone jealous good numbers are. /s simplicity simultaneous unlikelihood makes want cry. least Dodgers fans finally see opening pitch done earlier tbh.

It‚Äôs spray xD need speak  90days late fuck face. heard absolutely children's education mind. 3 complete safety children minds. option put classroom setting safely proper measures taken, repeat: go it.

People exhausted options keep kids larger groups choice, unless survive without work, feasible majority parents. Regardless, putting daycare safe environment children currently assuming responsibility risk.

Edit: mention place 15 kids. much put child contact atm? Trump win popular vote. ""people's choice."" Even was, tried minimize damage success heroes done. Without Fauci, Trump would still delirium virus bad, reopen Easter, problem 99% people infected, somehow miraculously disappear. Instead Fauci slapping face facts, forcing least make feeble effort something. No, enough, actions Fauci probably saved thousands lives. know also great idea, I‚Äôm suggesting preferable death COVID, please hear out:

Could make sort neighbourhood school post asking many parents living nearby situation either:

A. Set roster whereby groups five kids supervised online learning playing one parent rostered work day evening? 

B. Ask teachers don‚Äôt want die they‚Äôd like teach home, via internet registered homeschool educator. teachers will, short term, lose jobs. won‚Äôt able replace salaries, perhaps everyone got little sole parent child-minding rosters, you‚Äôre saving petrol childcare fees, might able afford $5 per day teacher, plus meal teacher per week next cook bulk (again, roster this). Perhaps slightly older kids could yard work cleaning help teacher times too, teacher terrible situation while.

3. Engage older siblings helping teacher by: easy marking little kids, virtual singing/choir, ‚Äòmine craft‚Äô hour kids device, home cooking lessons leftovers, reading internet, etc. support encouragement times.

If many teachers able sort choice get returning school, wouldn‚Äôt take long bedlam school administrators level, teachers would quietly hired back online formats.

By definition literally every retail worker world os getting fucked over. 

How much would consider getting fucked working Walmart? $30/hr?? Travelers insurance corporate head quarters. WFH since pandemic declared. 17 percent. Fuck. use sources agree ""masks work"" narrative? mean WalMarts real good relationship police since end called multiple times daily basis. done well? forest fire goes mean successfully fought already burned whole forest down.

Nevermind we're even *more* danger cases balloon customers burnt out, started verbally attack us every day. locations employees pulled departments tend doors. asked wear black. One got pulled department another got pulled lawn garden store. 5% sound death reality. Sure, let's put thinking caps 30 seconds here. would hospitals Sun Belt need PPE, staff, medical supplies handle dead bodies left rot 3 months? necessary, Northeast dire need too?

All wishful thinking stems hope worst behind us. Unfortunately, probably not. good point, team said they're worried finding enough people UK could virus test.

Really sad come US, helps us get cure faster least something good come horrible situation. Lol

You're problem too. Give quick rundown  ~~Hahaha! Fucking asshole.~~ mean, thoughts prayers him.  always suspicious ‚Äúre-opening‚Äù explanation southern outbreak. look mobility data absolutely connection. confirms here:

The virologist said northerners vacationing southern states may contributed spike COVID-19 cases.

Redfield said outbreaks appeared one north east, south ""everything happened around June 12 June 16. simultaneously kind popped"" independent whether locations reopen.

We're view something else driver,"" said, pointing week Memorial Day ""where lot Northerners decided go South vacations."" first response ...

I'm going stop there. clear want talk person replied to, that's fine. That's responded to. enjoy conversation. Exactly, information T-cell response withheld anyone? It‚Äôs literally right scientists doctors consume Merck CEO right caution people.

Are kidding?

ARE. ERs Miami filled icu patients, hallways chairs, there‚Äôs space. There‚Äôs icu psych telemetry beds.

Source: registered nurse mRNA vaccines work inserting genetic material cell produce viral proteins. 

&amp;#x200B;

The stuff go wrong, nutshell, production viral protein turns unintended toxicity/side effects accumulation defunct viral proteins cause disease. SARS 2 well known targeting brain nervous tissue (anosmia great example this. Olfaction taste carried cranial nerve III recall right. quote it); biggest concern buildup viral protein tissue, leading immune reaction cause nerve/brain damage, accumulation viral protein plaques like see measles.

&amp;#x200B;

Is far fetched? Absolutely, bet. viruses weird, weird shit. frankly, understand enough genetic code engineering proteins completely safe generate good immune response. take sequences nature, yet know everything sequences particular genome. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other viruses known plaque accumulation. Measles famous one, causing measles encephalitis. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, summarize, think risk high proven safe vectors involve cells making viral proteins. I'm idiot iphone app. Yes, recall wasnt protestors killing it? doesnt take much inference see difference two.

Hello? reddit. People come karma farm, share clickbait posts, spread consume propaganda particularly subs like this. matter comment makes sense, actually bothered read article general seem know talking about, people already made minds think believe can't change mind.

All said, really understand point involving National Guard. article mentions, sole purpose seems intimidate hospitals expertise (not mention unnecessarily exposes virus). Arizonan, confirm this. Hours whiehous sidelines CDC üòÇ Lol yeah like first program rolled out, couple weeks contain spread whatever. Sure thing guys, can‚Äôt wait til it‚Äôs gone üòÇüëçüèº You‚Äôd think virus would eventually mutate rather harmless long run, killing people doesn‚Äôt help spread. There‚Äôs signs happening, hospitalizations keep lowering, maybe it‚Äôs going slow Frankly, depends reasons imo.

I‚Äôm college student heading main campus next year mostly don‚Äôt real options here.

I can‚Äôt take semester else lose scholarships. classes need major offered online‚Äî even were, don‚Äôt learn well online. I‚Äôm paying money get good education, all.

I‚Äôm obviously going adhere COVID guidelines, pretty much take in-person classes.

If son wants go back similar reasons own, can‚Äôt say blame it. think best. That‚Äôs do. would still heavily reduce spread. no. Thats beyond silly.  Yes must black people blame.

The US 400,000 killed WW2, 10,000 month.

If count COVID pandemic running four months far, minimum 140,000 deaths (its likely much excess mortality properly taken account) Americans dying COVID numbers least 3.5 times higher per month dying World War 2. 

I'm pretty sure 10,000 deaths month World War 2 considered tragedy time.

Or could compare Vietnam. 60,000 deaths 7 years, 715 month. COVID killing Americans rate 50 times higher per month Vietnam War.

Again I'm pretty sure people thought 715 deaths month war tragedy. Todd Wilbur [copycat [similar different production procedure.

This common misunderstanding. I'll paste previous answer heere, really changed:

----

There two main issues conflating:

1. know
2. knew advised against

So, knew early (and pretty obvious) wearing masks certified fine particulates would filter viruses fell within tolerances.

What know nation-level impact general, low-quality mask use public. data influenza SARS strains said much back Feb March. April rolled around started get data nations vastly different strategies other, became clear COVID-19 responded differently diseases widespread mask use.

This data published starting mid April late April recommendations changing.

This science works.

But knew using N95 masks like going protect individual (to degree, given things need protect yourself). specifically advised people use unless ill, conserve PPE medical professionals, generally right call. Even was, shortages.[Leung 2020]

With perfect hindsight, obviously would done things differently, one knew parameters disease early parts year. even critiques often pointed early new data adopted, [Greenhalgh US Centres Disease Control Prevention originally advised public wearing masks covid-19 pandemic, advice updated 4 April 2020.

There legitimate concerns early approach, published [Cheng Research also done pandemic mass masking compliance high enough effectiveness assessed. absence evidence effectiveness clinical trials mass masking equated evidence ineffectiveness. mechanistic reasons covering mouth reduce respiratory droplet transmission and, indeed, cough etiquette based considerations evidence clinical trials.

But concerns whole standard approach pandemic management, aberant way COVID-19 addressed.

But, also lot friends medical/science/education fields mine husband‚Äôs occupations. 

We‚Äôre losing minds right trying convince aunts, uncles, parents, etc wear masks stay safe home much possible. 

So think it‚Äôs bit confirmation bias. like-minded peer groups taking things seriously versus group we‚Äôre less connected taking less seriously isn‚Äôt really representative imo. 

I think really large scale misinformation willful ignorance among every generation point. see depends you‚Äôre friends with. much hate saying this, young understand mindset. It‚Äôs good thing. Especially considering uni kids Alabama Covid parties pot got infected ‚Äúwon‚Äù. dad 101 fever slight cough getting tested tomorrow. also slight fever 99.4 think warrents getting test also? fever sign severe case corona virus? healthy oxegen levels shortness breath atm. surreal all. following Putin's playbook Lol sounds like you‚Äôre describing TN üòÖ governor said today plans spend whatever necessary state revenue fight abortion ban passed (because Sooooo concerned Vulnerable Tennesseans).

The virus care justice. places getting hit hardest automatically ones dick-iest masks. Sometimes hits places, times hits places lots people work essential workers multi-generational homes. That's California continues problems. I‚Äôm maricopa county getting ready forced classroom hundred kids day...

If I‚Äôm going martyred, may well experimental pincushion too.

Got vaccine? I‚Äôll take it. Gimme gimme. Duh fucked. saying virus going kill everyone (though conflicting information makes hard know guess exactly what's gonna happen), want everyone catching it, either. general though, humanity can't try pull together stop something bad progressing once?

Probably, doesn‚Äôt even say symptoms long.

Edit: also worth noting article said cold touch got testing tent, ‚Äúcold‚Äù subjective, think it‚Äôs safe say cold body dead least 10 minutes. Meaning would 35 minute maximum help him. Hopefully works well need to! :) part country rarely see people without masks we're sitting pretty infection rates. Get shit together rest country!

Usually 6 ft apart another person want extra cautious since it‚Äôs shared space wonder. reported people higher IQ tend greener, liberal less racist don‚Äôt see much effect. hand, bright believe social distancing work, starting social distancing make smarter. provide source 200 cases 1% rate would mean 2 patients.

I seen studies I'm doctor. I'm sure measure ""lifelong damage"" without living life. But, math crazy. Well that‚Äôs one way get people wear masks ;) I‚Äôm preschool teacher, school starts 3. psychologists disagree you. extroverted people need it.

Ahh see also touched noodle! know there's something they're missing... willing educate themselves. basically everyone protesting last month bunch tardy mofos. things usually studied? actually observe actual disease results determining vulnerable age groups were. seems like bizarre methodology. 


It's saying X% people age group least one following: obesity, heart problems, asthma, diabetes, couple rare factors. [The US terms many tests carries per capita. great measure efficiency dealing COVID-19 countries virus effectively controlled (e.g. Vietnam Thailand) simply need test much. fact, based fact states like Florida report positive test rate [12% there's strong indication U.S. testing enough capture positive cases.

In terms life expectancy, [the U.S. #38 barely ahead Cuba. that, far ahead developing countries: life expectancy U.S. 78.9. Thailand, 76.9, Vietnam 75.3. still places plenty people vulnerable group COVID-19.

Hell, we're gonna use life expectancy measure vulnerability COVID-19, Japan life expectancy 84.5 [median age (second Monaco), need bullshit excuse explain COVID-19 results. Quest test last week literally took 20 hours. sure would be... year 2023 account trade war China throwing tantrum EU like Donald lately???  Good luck? terms inflammation. B Tcells stay unaffected.

Something like alcohol avoid four months... Omg could permanent. lung. hear long lasting cognitive effects damage organs (via things like clots etc).

A big reason people taking seriously spoliled long lot diseases control, realize damage disease do. people actually fucking sick. think throwing fever severe barely even scratches surface fucking sucky sick be. Confusion Chaos. realize extra data means time? best give 6 month effects virus Um, address real life address without comment removed bot? is...real. Yup knowing Texas bunch fat, unhealthy pigs. end wrong side hospital War bonds? War production? rationing food.

Did learn ANYTHING home front school?

Or maybe proved Europeans taken 1000x seriously Americans. learn struggle hardship like. Americans learn comfortable chairs are. one hurt! thought process is, fact 'study' even done, makes greatly ashamed country was; born in, raised in, told many great shit. 

My mental state actually slipped super hard earlier thinking people actions.

It's ridiculous, america perspective absolutely revolting. can't believe happened Human history, year, truly, low-balling term btw, atrociously disgusting every level possible. think Trump broader view Fauci I‚Äôm appreciates cost shutdown.  happy see Fauci able speak mind. Let Fauci Fauci! happening 4 days now. drink lots water well vit.C tablet (like 3000mg day). worried it? Americans might able get coronavirus control Trump leaves office, likely it‚Äôll take vaccines readily available. many stupid and/or ignorant and/or entitled people stampeding stateside Trump silences anybody make look good.

I hope continue speak spread truth Treason. needs remove ASAP. Yes, do. lot coffee. place come drink water thirsty. Coffee need think vodka longer need think. That's u need. flu season confusion chaos. Surprise, people believe scientific prevention disease ""intelligent"" don't. memeing. That's trump said Easter shit mean yes there's always morons, water good drink pretty much Europe. moving way fast liking. know it‚Äôs keep safe it. Except trusted people lied us masks... Stupidity. blood boils whenever see something like this. old lady pull mask lick fingers count money

wow decision made yet. OCBoE recommended it, power make decision. still individual school districts. Glad see enforcing rules. baby due too, get feeling.

Dont fucking balls 4 motlnths ago infront mf orange baffoon. think majority US population is? Well educated, well informed critical thinkers? Rest peace. What? 

You actually believe axis evil bullshit? believe US pre producing 3 viable vaccine candidates.... one gets approved, 100 million doses shelf already. none 3 approved, wasted money. See ""operation warp speed"". Maybe drink heaps water see feel. forget rich well connected either. way hell Red team ghouls get despite downplaying shit virus (at least lose November suddenly start care). us underlying conditions really want thank help speed process. sure yet I'm leaning heavily ""we're lot stubborn fat here"" Came say this. sucks, tried educate family? Perhaps show anecdotal evidence virus actually risk are, might wake up? Anyways, good health strentgh Spain! Maybe Plaquenil would help too. Yeah, fucking easier people STILL can't fucked cause people selfish, lazy cretins. need wield gun, need wear tiny bit fabric face, fucking people CAN'T that.

People today zero idea struggle actually slightest inconvenience makes selfish twat. 100%. really appreciated civil discourse. something often found social media, made work. 

Cheers seeing you, many like you, side this. Get ready sales mocked fake immunization records another way saying social distancing may dumb... yah, hes still favorite youtuber re-election campaign. ""Look defeated COVID19 (by supressing case reporting like China)!""

""Good citizens, elect Joe Biden guarantee numbers go up! (to actually supressed them)!"" Even dumb people want ostracized. Someone snuck cat onboard.

FTFY  Props correcting post. Thanks u/CatHairInYourEye posting source! I've got underlying health conditions US, Healthcare depends either gainful employment, disabled can't work... rich. Anyway... got fired standing Trump voting boss tried force work nobody wearing masks. life literally air right now. gotta go get job middle this, ways worse.

y'all got political asylum? I'll learn damn language. let die.   global pandemic requires national leadership. Policy variations based situation state, even city, fine useful - there's overriding national policy ensures basic minimum met, rules enforced, buy-in general public willingly follow guidelines.

Just imagine Trump said wearing masks every person's patriotic duty protect nation. supporters would love masks. took opposite stance.  Like Sallah said Indy "" go first"" grandma wheels, would bicycle appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Honestly, quickly, all, particularly conservative candidates. really boils well spin narrative. Look difference Al Franklin Trump, sex scandals, one still office. last week Tucker Carlson got nod David Duke Trump‚Äôs VP head writer outed spewing resist garbage online, made way onto show. far know he‚Äôs off-the-air yet. Flip side, Canada‚Äôs Trudeau black face thing, he‚Äôs still office. Steve King still representing Iowa.

That said, don‚Äôt think comparison applies here. comparable Covid statement could compared blatant racist statements. Now, politician saying something like, ‚Äúeveryone get weak people die, we‚Äôll better without them.‚Äù Yeah, maybe would comparable would get groundswell support removal. far know, one saying anything like that. making poor decisions (either poor per opinion poor objectively given hindsight information now). ok, give information effectiveness SMALLEST dose (which STILL lot side effects!)

I waiting info. thanks advance. watching unintended consequences lie told CDC, though good intent trying secure stockpiles health workers, spread total doubt effectiveness masks.

Three 14 patients given highest dose experienced severe side effects, dose used larger trials.

Can name vaccine.....ANY vaccine approved widespread use (here hundreds upon hundreds millions people) 40% chance fever? 

Again, side effects mentioned like fever rare normal vaccines, like 1 thousands. 40%. I‚Äôm favor opening schools. all. 

But that‚Äôs said, it‚Äôs misquote. Ahh different still makes sense Watch Redfield... keep sh*t you‚Äôll next Fauci!

/s Should‚Äôve told us shit months ago man. MUH FREEDOM!!! mean, yeah. Experimental vaccines often fatal side effects, cause things like strokes seizures. vaccines make market gone trials uncover bad things.... short term. 


The problem time machines know 10 years later people took vaccine (for example) higher rate Alzheimers heart disease. lot lower risk, non-zero risk studies done 10 years later. 


So decide. take risk vaccine may hurt 10 years virus almost certainly next 2 3 years (unless miracle republicans start socially distancing wearing masks can't remain 6 feet apart). 24 minimum Although path getting pants-on-head stupid, I‚Äôm glad hear you‚Äôre passionate wearing masks.

The thing look candidates behind race goes well could aid global vaccination effort.

Appointee.. yet another administrations ass puppets like foul Betsy Davos woman.. considered hitting doc early refill case Damn sucks live everyone wears mask stores somtimes even parks Mixed bag sit.  Hopefully new requirements wear masks help (Sullivan, Greene, Washington, carter, etc). Doug Ford even praised Trudeau Chrystia Freeland early pandemic.

The USA essentially failed state. watch much US media, think almost live somehow need change things way... Doug Ford calls Chrystia Freeland firecracker something, I'm pleasantly surprised. knew moment Canada/Ontario would get relatively well. Imagine life devoid meaning feel compelled put self-worth single retarded debate. purposely letting people dying dont pay social security We‚Äôre super social murder monkeys!

Aldi's Coca Cola imitation best think. quite good 90% good since half cost really mind. Eh. SNS, that‚Äôs woefully unprepared respiratory pandemic isn‚Äôt influenza. 

Realistically, would cost much requisite machines people sitting around labs non pandemic years. 

The solution seems working hire bunch recent graduates, PhD/masters students undergrads micro/molecular/immu programs lab experience, perform manual procedures machines leased/manufactured/bought. smart thing would screen hire people ahead time, like reserve science force (smaller towns reserve policemen firefighters, comparison), way could experience vet research labs, hiring training process would streamlined fun stuff.

The part reagents- can‚Äôt stock possible primer/probe combos requisite amount perform nation‚Äôs worth rtPCR every possible pandemic bug. combination specifically designed every pathogen want test. CDC fucked primers beginning, could really good testing response. bright side need reagents liter quantities since reaction quantities small.

VTM tubes sample collection, stocked though, agree there. think hundreds pounds quantities stocked every public health lab, SNS sites ton like supplies. state chem lab taken manufacturing sharing VTM states, apparently bulletproof supply FBS state‚Äôs ranching industry.

Trying think else could stocked ahead time. It‚Äôs great intention, people country aren‚Äôt willing spend requisite amount public health- even needle exchanges sequencing food borne pathogens uphill battle, totally shouldn‚Äôt be. raging sociopath is! can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm reading headline - wtf  one point time 58% cases USA could traced back NYC. NYS built highest test capacity state faster other. less 2 weeks told job federal govt. clue bad spread was... turns 40% positive test almost month means far could ever managed it. 3 weeks lock still testing 20s percentage wise... 

Arizona, Texas Florida 5 months prepare this... protect themselves. 10‚Äôs thousands NYrs died March didn‚Äôt know tenth know virus even recognize it‚Äôs presence. 

There reason state level infection. excuse almost 1000 people dying mid July. suffered others could learn... bet don‚Äôt social distance. seems obvious people taking precautions also intelligent article bit transparent attempt get idiots wear masks wear them. Maybe transparent work knows. friend told you, read somewhere, case good solid evidence... pulled something thin air. Based.

I learned physical distancing helps. rural small town America here, confirm, like 90% totally think fine good idea. 

Normally brush ignore ignorance honestly tough pandemic. depressing see whole town outright hate science. signs town hating Governor enforced shelter place order bend curve. 

Then confederate flags flying high proud (in northern Illinois...), even small town ""All Live Matter"" protest show support police. Police who, way, say would enforce Govenor's Shelter Place orders. Funny thing is... Taking account USA ""liberated"" countries, could definitely help. problem is, guys already weapons. civilians already armed! report says fund PPE comply seems Americans going take pandemic seriously unless kind turns victims brain eating zombies.

The action mainly focused tourist-heavy Hampton Roads area, younger patrons inside restaurant bars parties wearing masks, Northam said.

That part state seen infections skyrocket past two weeks, seven-day average new cases climbing 346 Tuesday, compared 57 early June. Virginia Beach, 40 percent coastal city‚Äôs 817 known cases detected past two weeks.

‚ÄúThere clearly community spread,‚Äù Northam said, calling caseload ‚Äúvery concerning.‚Äù

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) urged local leaders across state take bolder steps enforce physical distancing mask requirements bars restaurants.

‚ÄúThe vast majority bars restaurants state compliance, flagrantly violating law endangering public health,‚Äù Hogan wrote letter county health officers local liquor boards.

‚ÄúYou responsibility enforce laws,‚Äù letter said. ‚ÄúViolators warned, fined, actions taken regarding licenses, closed necessary.‚Äù

Hogan‚Äôs letter came Maryland reported 733 new cases Tuesday ‚Äî largest daily increase since June 5. state‚Äôs seven-day average new cases 552, highest mark since mid-June. biggest spike came Prince George‚Äôs County.

Maryland also reported daily uptick hospitalizations ICU bed use, 29 people hospitalized 10 patients intensive care.

Hogan warned increase infections among younger adults, noting rate positive test results residents age 35 84 percent higher older.

‚ÄúAt least 12 states already moved re-close bars restaurants ‚Äî want forced take action Maryland,‚Äù Hogan said.

An executive order Hogan signed last month requires staff wear face coverings working, prohibits people congregating bar areas limits service six people table, using every booth keeping customers seated six feet apart.

Some state‚Äôs harder-hit areas need Hogan remind importance enforcing regulations.

In Montgomery County, officials said already closed two businesses fined third complying social distancing measures.

Society Lounge Republic Garden Silver Spring closed licenses suspended Sunday failing observe social distancing rules, county announced Tuesday. Block, food hall bar Rockville, fined $500 also violating social distancing requirement receiving initial warning county July 8.

The District recorded 40 additional infections Tuesday covid-19 deaths fifth consecutive day.

Health experts praised area leaders increasing capacity hospital beds, said worry continuing rise infections could begin overwhelm hospitals.

‚ÄúThe virus still around still circulating transmitted,‚Äù said Eric R. Houpt, head Division Infectious Diseases International Health University Virginia Health System Charlottesville. ‚ÄúWe hospital capacity, let‚Äôs hope don‚Äôt need it.‚Äù

As residents grow frustrated shutdown restrictions, repeated calls local officials wear masks maintain distances fostered tensions, people openly flouting guidelines.

Northam tried soften frustrations, saying region‚Äôs health economy depend everyone acting together. However, said, considering measures stop virus spreading, including reducing size gatherings allowed 50 250 imposing earlier cutoff time alcohol sales state.

‚ÄúThis political,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThis health well-being, it‚Äôs also economy. It‚Äôs going take us move forward safely.‚Äù

Nicole Riley, Virginia director National Federation Independent Business, praised Northam‚Äôs decision crack violators rather tighten restrictions businesses. warned order could put business owners awkward position playing ‚Äúthe enforcer government‚Äù telling customers can‚Äôt enter without mask.

‚ÄúThis opens door lawsuits business return, state offer legal immunity,‚Äù Riley said.

Virginia Republican leaders called Northam‚Äôs action unfair businesses people choose wear mask.

‚ÄúThis mandate puts businesses untenable position. keep licenses, must confront customers choose comply,‚Äù House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) said statement. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help think issuing statewide ‚Äòor else‚Äô threat little create defiance.‚Äù

The District, Maryland Virginia reported 1,574 cases Tuesday. Maryland Virginia reported nine deaths.

The region‚Äôs seven-day average number deaths dropped 24, level last seen early April. hospitalizations region ticked upward recent days, number ICU beds use patients requiring ventilators continues hold steady. try avoid it, cracks already starting show.

He‚Äôs great Fauci. knows all. /s Trumps gonna use one day See back September 8th prediction accuracy check. May odds favor. put beautifully rather bluntly. wholeheartedly agree man. insane new virus... we‚Äôve sequenced studied dozen similar coronaviruses. Doesn‚Äôt matter, they‚Äôre still mandatory they‚Äôre still breaking law. true, I've actually less alone time normally would like wife also home (we work entertainment industry we're laid around time) much smaller social outlet. definitely difficult sometimes.  could done now. lot longer 4-8 weeks. understand thats bigger talking point. opportunity listen experts. leaders fucked up. warned would happen happened. observable evidence experts knew talking about.

""under control"" TWO MONTHS?!?! anyone realise fucking crazy is? saying ""under control, mean numbers START go down. means bell curve peaks two months, going LEAST million deaths U.S. alone. Az never mask policy. guideline recommended mask wear. went viral he‚Äôs idiot one practice preach. missing point, first, media's treatment different situations. *Focus progress, perfection* right. Screw older teachers high risk kids teachers. screw potential long term effects even healthy people. Yeah tourist called socialist/communist enforcing mask mandate. feels like first shut completely wasted idiots like that. We‚Äôre dragging shit out. Sucks working American public right now.  could definitely get disposable clothes Thank you! rabbit hole needed non-covid related reasons. thinking tocotrienols would magic, maybe useful addition cancer care. Unfortunately Covid cancer care prioritized well before. UK, Florida Europe.

Except y‚Äôall really pay doctors nurses poorly. Hey man, I'm American stuck armpit Texas. I'm watching nation collapse front people perfect storm rich showing us care us, actively hate us happy feed us proverbial wolves gain. 

And apparently totally cool that.

I'm right you. Sorry seemed like outsider throwing rocks glass house. things know bring change need.

Montana Wyoming, greatest number cases national park areas college/resort towns highest property taxes (read: state owners). Ditto Colorado.

Nice try. one writing articles news segments country follow advice without question. know, disagreeing. :-) dont think sort bot, person maniac Sweden CDC told us months ago average person buy mask they'd wear wrong actually likely become infected?

While agree mask wearing essential epidemic care entity making recommendation here. Exactly. shit happens still supporters administration.

Ignoring expert warning open soon, surge happened close things down...the shit happen school reopening. Never learns. Fucking idiots playing people's lives. Sorry asked before, American explain judges making executive public health decisions?  Thanks info. I'm also seeing 138,000 deaths today.

Now sit down.  I'm causing shootings?! Oh shit idea get border closed? Delete data delete COVID... scientific factoid. Hey man. Riverside San Bernardino counties right Orange County. problem true every person current administration. lie. Please name another one admitted lying.

Let's shit one people trying help country get pandemic unless personally better job. Given resume, presidential metal freedom, respect global medical community, think fair say best hope circumstances. Masks we‚Äôre SAFER HOME!!! state never hit hard initially, bars opened early last month, went stable 1000 cases 8000 climbing, went back stage, closed bars 3 weeks. RemindMe! 8 weeks Masks vaccines need legislated. bad lawmakers chickens. Yeah, looking window right now. shooting, looting. hope eliminate appearance covid ravaging country, without paying economic cost actually effective quarantine. don‚Äôt care people die, want numbers improve. CDC apparently won‚Äôt it, they‚Äôll leave out. Donnie made clear told administration reduce amount testing order reduce number cases. also made clear joke, like White House tried claim. Deaths strangers don‚Äôt matter him, wants look like he‚Äôs good job. Yes, cult leader clearly decided, per Russian handlers, weaponize pandemic profit political gaming. I‚Äôm one kink shame. COVID microbe defined size masks defined filtration instrument given mask, number interactions distance variables. idiotic make statement like this. people understand, NEW virus. know handle it. 

We dealing Corona viruses millennia, scientifically since 1930's. corona viruses similar transmission. common fucking lot corona viruses cause it.

""New"" virus non-argument. I'm going upvote honesty. think data referred article outdated. hospitalizations deaths certainly rising parts U.S. got passed Michigan. Today guy refused wear mask stabbed 77 year old man asking put one tried attack deputy responded knife. Another guy pulled knife Meijer asked put mask. People batshit. Baltimore. see go whole lot dick noses, people pulling masks talk, people hovering instead distancing, bbqs parties. Nobody gives rat's ass.  unbelievably selfish get.  believe real value spiritual teachings religions, Christianity think, bastardized control masses. Christianity become false idol Jesus warned against. Look Christofascism. ""First COVID Vaccine tests US shows promising immune response""

Good news? open immediate deals Russia constant supply fruit/veg.

&amp;#x200B;

Its poor threat modern means rebounding it. isnt 1950's anymore. Monsanto laced fruit/veg would lead to...increased health, life expectancy, lower cancer rates. tariffs 'so called' allies suddenly appearing would back 'good old days' friends traded.

&amp;#x200B;

The loss would temporary. One winter without shitty bland fuck California strawberries...is loss? lol!! goal kill large portion **black** population

FTFY Hey good news! NASCAR race soon everyone still living go person! Yeah larger things take much time. 

If write stupid replies filled template legalzoom now. easy, stop making excuses. reading guidebook trip said young men 18+ months compulsory military service learn lot Judo.

The author said unintended consequence bar fights S. Korea get pretty brutal. That's awfully easy say. put money mouth is?

As in: one district's teachers went strike ... school board responded firing ... much money bank account would donate teachers' strike fund? 

How much could shell help keep food table, start *brand new careers* since teaching certs ruined? much could pay make whole pension money would lose?

I figure answer falls somewhere ""little"" ""none"" Agreed‚Äîand fully mature adult, understand that. Unfortunately, hasn‚Äôt fully grasped yet. Right now, school planning mixture person virtual learning. I‚Äôm hoping hope rethink plan go fully virtual. seen pack people trains Asian countries? They‚Äôre literally pushed carriage train coordinators like sardines. Asian cities insanely dense populations. Along weird (to western world) eating traditions involve raw food (with less food standard regulations) economic disparity creates disease prone place. decision move US school paying off. Mostly dream died younger man ever solidified right. 

No amount extra earnings would make want live US now. I've read. ""It true natural infection almost always causes better immunity theres attorneys willing accept. That's different argument. Personally, think daily deaths Texas Italy ballpark hit 4 digits September, everyone voluntarily lockdown anyway economic damage going severe either way. least lockdown less people die there's control order economic impact, certain extent. absolute criminals.

They could done Europe government pay people's wages keep everyone employed. vaccine available, able recover much faster economically.

This would ton problems right away, would cost far less bailouts. many positives always touching stuff putting hands mouth. Plus probably wear masks much properly wash hands enough. inconvenienced wearing mask, wait tube stuck throat. Absolutely! many stories heartbreaking. Stay safe there! Sure would nice someone would telling people mask worn NOSE MOUTH. lot folks getting important info.

Just sayin'. individual still responsible limit orders effect material nonpublic information.  Meanwhile, life really changed tell earth ain't flat! Oh... Wrong post No. words use convey certain meaning. There's difference prevent reduce. false sense confidence non-medical grade mask lead even transmission due riskier behaviour. Masks important, thing. Case numbers matter point states, deaths do. still possible America hits 500k+ deaths continues ways going. That's ridiculous, way American government citizens handling pandemic could literally kill population one 52 states.

Edit-I say case numbers matter know they're going go stuff changes, stop bringing number fact people changes care. Bring deaths. 3.04% American population COVID-19, care. SKO BIRDS BABY Please correct misconception, progress end going away soon restrictions lifted? 

What difference 8 weeks now, vaccine coming next 8 weeks? charge fraud $5k?  Never going happen. Even got everybody wear mask people I've seen wearing still pull cough.... Yes, should. want thousand dollars going family charity? want go government family fight it. 

Most likely former, unless 28 year old moron. yes, get fuck outta get legal zoom make will.

And begin touch need living will. planning emergency dolt. Dollar milkshake? Yeah stuff wal mart cheap. feel like everyone Reddit lives city, there‚Äôs shit ton places go to. believe it‚Äôs going ballot time looked older couple lived house two story house finished attic thought bit excessive upon investigation planned wouldn‚Äôt drive nuts.

Anything short posturing act like something prevent imported cases starting new clusters nothing produces meaningful effect. Good luck getting entitled spoiled immature pea brained fucktards minorly inconvenience benefit others. Masks mandatory Maryland couple months means fuck everyone leaves dick noses hanging masks. mean, beer tap taste better bottle.

Still, people need stay fuck home. area, they've closed whole streets bars restaurants put tables street get around ""no indoor dining"" rule, pack close together pointless. 

It's fucking stupid, hey that's Orange County you... Someone tell gov deathsentence this.. thatd hed care best buy Canada since last month. Speak really wish news hospitals didn‚Äôt keep pain gruesome reality disease hidden away. public isn‚Äôt allowed inside hospital news programs show medical personnel PPE. Everything sanitized removed public view...we left detached. 

While cliche picture worth thousand words, people need see horror truly appreciate hopefully learn true cost disease. Modernity removed death brutal struggle survive sight. visuals Vietnam War evening news showed average American mere sliver brutality war, helped educate public. 

To change opinions lethality COVID-19, need people see poor patients work save enduring. many people, disease away happening anonymous person. need remove antiseptic lens show fellow human beings hurting dying. Maybe idiots wear mask! think fauci wrong blessing disguise. american hard right say, ""i wearing mask fauci incompetent"". longer would wearing mask seen ""bowing deep state"". total, people would wear masks. hope, though post worldometer link without saying already posted? always try posting worldometer links never let reddit thinks itd repeat link. Speak story restrictions base activity Okinawa pretty funny morbid, fatalistic way. Americans choosing engage risky behavior spread disease, one closest allies basically telling us fix ourselves.

I talked friend stationed there, restrictions Marines US military island. restrictions base activity limited couple camps outbreaks happening. scale restrictions news reports bit off, general thesis correct.

Americans like told do, obey. applicable even United States Marines subject Uniform Code Military Justice. organization spends indoc training PI San Diego focusing drill, think instills instant willingness obedience orders. Yet set free, disobey.

In pandemic, that's can't nice things. Sounds like selling drugs kids I've wearing mask whole time would take 2 months everyone got shit together? Also good strategy. :-)

The pipeline merrier, though. Especially one current phase 3's go well.  Unfortunately Florida allow recall elections, state senate controlled republicans. Random CBC article. biochem equivalent test pilots. Braave gave unreadable link. asked one bar sliding right forever. 

Please, back saying go away. situation, no. real life complicated. people compromised immune systems medically can't vaccinated, babies children young vaccinated, kids whose parents choose vaccinated. One adult choosing vaccinated spread disease people, kill them. yesterdays death total. Near 1000 significant jump. Back worst like 2000 day? We'll certainly get back soon. could always amend it. Hey live Northern Ontario. medical district 1 active case 0 hospitals.

Go back Florida kthbai. üòí interesting perceived survival stuff. knew deaths lagged behind infections, cross mind testing gets better, deaths lag even grabbed CBC article random, might better data elsewhere.

Americans (aside young ones big cities) can, think that's side it. stand woman Michigan! states crashing burning, mostly holding own. Lots angry people fewer dying people. death

Putting rather lightly there. based Biff Trump. True story. could kill parents. I'd make live garage school year vaccine. mean I've pretty outspoken China US's handling downright criminal. administration cares much appearances reality happily allowed 138,000 Americans die many, many come. Fuck authoritarians. Yeah, saw article took chance n edited title, think represents important part article. thank crap like going around attitude. best case scenario (the next trials go well better), soon could vaccine available? long trial stage take? talking sometime fall next year, even best case scenario?

The fact US country depends DOs vast majority composed MD rejects tells enough. exam? vast majority write COMLEX USMLE rofl like what?

I say anything support NPs MDs anyways I'm sure talking there. 

Do legitimately think sheer number medical schools limited oversight quality education similar top tier vs mid tier vs low tier schools? Like come on. best example place like Howard U, Toledo, Cincinnati vs higher tiers like Dartmouth, higher still like NYU, Cornell, Sinai etc. quality graduates average far superior higher tier schools that's legit fact due accept rigors training irrespective board exams (which even reflective clinical practice). games like Pokemon take 20-25 hours. I've played lot, fast. FF8 good 65+ hours til done 100%. I've started Pokemon Yellow, Pokemon Clover, Grandia, Shining Souls 2(more Diablo clone, playing it).

Lmao true long stock market keeps going im fine depression pro trump posts deleted ""political discussion"", anti trump posts responded not?

Wait. Nevermind... Read damn article. surreal bad Wildcat term strike workers walk job without members holding voting union authorize strike. technically illegal US, doubly since public workers allowed strike contract anyway. really severity, conditions get severe start seeing That‚Äôs dumb argument. day age kids online friends socializing. adaptive. Don‚Äôt ignorant put kids lives line. day I'm becoming convinced either coup revolt Trump manages get reelected. country cannot possibly sustain another year this, let alone four. already things like this? mean, maybe they're expensive, they've existed long time. quote right encapsulates America screwed - **""our rights important responsibilities""**. Rather nation people contributing making USA stronger, bunch people scavenging wealth resources dying America. There's rejuvenation, plunder looting. also appeared white power show: üò≠ Whoa re-election chances.  Well going pi‚Äôs redditors God bless f loonies Dr Fauci enough reality show. games Mr. T. good doctor ready show much punch punch bowl. Definitely. wasn‚Äôt thinking band that‚Äôs great example larger class sizes common. 

I commenting general proficiency arts achieved much readily direct mentoring tutoring. It‚Äôs area students clearly benefit teachers. would important cared arts education reasonable fraction much should, though. Wrong. US Yes, garbage. False negatives large percentage cases. Facemasks course know ability bring dead back life. know that. That's worried about. Reporters protests already assaulted arrested hundreds, hardly blip. comes next? hottest places US surging covid19 care imagine apocalyptic levels winter flu covid19 season. say didn‚Äôt expect this? certain point it‚Äôs students fault local government opening bars town like Athens expect happen?

I attend UGA gone it‚Äôs Summer crowd far. students actually come back campus it‚Äôs gonna issue. It‚Äôs absurd think 18 year old coming Athens isn‚Äôt gonna wanna go bars semester starts. Who. EVERLOVING FUCK. going South unless critically necessary??? I'm sure somebody going call fake news. Wow They‚Äôre also biggest fucking snowflakes ever, funny LOVE use term Yeah lot people really understand razor-thin margins industries. Sorry, thought would clear meant viral transmission.

There‚Äôs absolutely evidence prevent viral transmission per WHO. Obviously cannot comment whole state city ~40k SE WI significant uptick mask wearing following official prevention guidelines. Let‚Äôs place blame pandemic people regardless validity argument. Fear shame proven extremely ineffective ways managing current crisis. wife wear masks everywhere take recommended precautions. 4 year old still touches everything we‚Äôre constantly pull mask back nose help adjust it. 

A kid‚Äôs gonna kid regardless parents do. aware she‚Äôs still difficult precautions public. Ehh, country already divided is. dont think they're gonna able even follow simple rule wearing mask, let alone restart economy viable vaccine produced. Even then, still anti vaxxers thats gonna ruin everyone else. 

Politicians US gonna keep pitting citizens other. Eh can‚Äôt really compare traditional science research medical journal publications. hardly even compare citation/publication metrics across similarly related fields. It‚Äôs fantastic journal, doesn‚Äôt surpass Nature Science. know right, work retail wear mask 8 hours straight half hour lunch break take off, think wear 20 minutes spend inside store Literal terrorist. Trying take everyone else cause he‚Äôs probably fucked knows it. Fuck economy! reddit coroners assured people would never die streets, could happen? amazing analogy. I'm even sarcastic. guess planned adult life around get money pass extra suprise. probably best plan life waiting inheritance.

This correct way think inheritance. Assume get anything (or taxes eat it). way never disappointed chance get money inheritance pleasantly surprised. Summary situation article:


My mom said touch stove, it‚Äôs really hot. touched it, burnt myself. got mad said ‚ÄúI told touch stove!‚Äù don‚Äôt let anyone tell do, looked mom touched stove again. want touch stove, I‚Äôm going to. right US citizen touch hot stove. hurts me, keeps hurting me, defying orders makes feel strong like I‚Äôm big person.

Stay tail car please. 1.1m $5k   Yeah okay. serious conspiracy theory bullshit reminds dumb things people thought 50s Red Scare happening. Stiglitz awesome People need work people need eat.

This due total failure government provide disaster relief people stay home needed. someone fits one categories mentioned: **If can't wear mask whatever reason, need avoid public spaces. period.** 

[There exceptions loopholes nobody's unique circumstances make acceptable endanger health safety everyone else around them.  KiDs CaNt GeT Emu right idea.... Get back school kiddos, daddy needs earn rich guy who's working home extra bucks. government wants pretend COVID doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚Äúadministration‚Äù better China know haven‚Äôt truthful cases deaths Danke schon! Exactly! whenever bring get downvoted oblivion.

 Chinese shills reddit full force. going wait long. know candidates likely safe. efficacy signal, approval pretty quickly state announced today they‚Äôre allowing schools reopened ‚Äúkids aren‚Äôt likely catch it‚Äù ‚Äúdata shows schools aren‚Äôt significant source transmission.‚Äù Yeah shit that‚Äôs happens close schools right pandemic starts. literally looking listening media talking points freaking awful Honestly, hardly think businesses would heed warnings cdc accord without pressure government. It‚Äôs reality, although general attitude toward masks differ state.

As far churches go, that‚Äôs tough call. gyms department stores open mask policies, don‚Äôt see churches shouldn‚Äôt be.
That said, singing restrictions obvious me... news, water wet. know there‚Äôs legal grounds that, right? long reporters white they‚Äôre probs safe. they‚Äôre black, given cops America, bets off. Yah... lot whether citizens politicians going believe science take things seriously. think probably biggest thing really. Masks everything else help people need buy in. US huge amount arent willing buy anything else even forced wear mask. thought changing epidemiology many times. see percentage? imagine difficult is....I've relationship girlfriend 8 years going 9 soon we've long distance 3 years that's already bad enough occasional visit set date future look forward must rough  horrible treat elderly disposable ways, think that's Trump give AF virus. knows communities hurting never cared begin with. Surprising needed explanation, well. Safety efficasy normally 6 month process. 

Do know many vaccine attempts went sars success, many went ebola success? 

Vaccines simple. justified police shooting

???

How figure?

Would change mind Sean Ernest Ruis turned LatinX? per usual, ethnicity race, class. ""Poor people die covid"" drive clicks. CHina pulled type shit, they'd state US right now. Evidently something better. North 
They still 0 ""official"" case makes best responding country Well said F that. Kanye 2020 husband dies this, really sending White House used, snotty tissues. plus outsourcing automation good jobs continue unabated. I'm sure US I'm there, Texas states start making masks mandatory places? Original article state that.  

But fair enough, need let Canadians in.

But unless 100K fine and/or jail time, someone owns multiple properties consider 1K convience fee.  People need made example of.

My wife came back Italy/Europe March 10, 100% isolated two weeks, spat face gave huge FUCK us others like us. I'm getting North Korea vibe this.

""Everything great. Thank Dear Leader amazing job he's you. go back work!"" Kinda reminds YouTube video showing add headphone jack iPhone drill. Lots dumbasses tried destroyed phones. Given CDC warning pregnant women greater risk complications infant experienced brain injury utero, PLEASE get national guidance exempting pregnant elderly teachers classroom? COVID19 vaccine doesn‚Äôt work well like seasonal flu? everyone else trying figure get, pay tesing, would nursing home turn free testing ? make sense. killing people. death rate continues fall. emu bit sister once.... redfield sucks tbh There's also high level sources said traces virus found Spain early early last year...and Brazil last November. Oxford University scientists.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying, there's ton information idea fuck exactly true yet. want info STD's I'm going Dr. Drew Chucky boy. agree people working around many people day high risk infection? think best limits/stops business travel. client traveling facility one states easily deny entering. Jesus Still gonna fuckin wear one, gonna get vaccine either. last sentence, already are. countries taking virus seriously, can't fathom guys making things worse (not everyone, maskless people shouting freedom such) False. Also keep mind, death full recovery two options. Many people survive consequences last rest lives. Clean dog second guess So. That's then. Could Hospitals ignore order. continue send Data CDC? Hide yo dog Well that's awesome. Says who? Three candidates entering PIII testing now. could efficacy signal EUA months need board game nights game groups went virtual thankfully. adapted. know board gamers haven‚Äôt. Oddly. obvious. Bc will. waiting till get pushed back goal line dangerous time punt Im getting point counter going shoot frozen paintballs that's told public

No shit - told public God knows many would told us effective. changed story supply increased. called lying

It's called managing supply. many mask would gone buy said brain wont accept cognitive dissonance wrong. get that.

Sure knew masks effective told us . LIE. it.

I lie kids time they're immature can't understand complex nuanced things. principle applies lie keep making excuses Fauci lied public effectiveness masks?

He lie need excuse. went Morning shows ADMITTED lied told us why! 

Gee know maybe he's must exhausted mental gymnastics go thru keep sad.

What call mental gymnastics people call critical thinking. people like make sad. hopeful population come pandemic smarter average.

But means continue concern troll orange God understand supply logistics triage. Make everyone think dumb enough think maybe maybe PPE shortage worse said effective. 

Oh hey let's forget simple fact mask work keep spreading disease getting gloss fact orders magnitude less people walking arround virus four months ago. Let's beat fuck career public servant job fucking temerity put interest country ahead Donny's Everything unknown fam, that‚Äôs frustration comes from. messaging every evolution aspect virus PISS POOR execution left us wide open bullshit politicization we‚Äôre experiencing now.

I‚Äôm frustrated it‚Äôs nothing you. like 65 per minute... nothing masks. simply gives probability someone Covid present. Care help dummy? I'm trying understand percentage expressed ""0.0065"" quoting 0.65%. (Not disputing it, understand it.) Low effort click bait people looking good news. people would still medical masks entitled think deserve ‚Äúreal‚Äù masks. 'right work' laws NEVER challenged FEDERAL court

Um, sure want test theory -- maybe test would get -- amid federal courts practically brimming Trump, G.W. Bush, G.H.W. Bush, even gorram **Reagan** appointees?

Lemme know goes :-/ PLUR Yeah Trump morons call crisis actors (very committed role) claim car accidents victims happened COVID 19. far gone, may able affect aren‚Äôt blind self interests. yo I‚Äôm Irish skin red still come visit hear Guinness significantly better get Mr Director, might well wish pony it. Fun fact! average human body volume 95 liters, 150,000 bodies would fill 5.7 Olympic swimming pools! trump wants win election mandate masks. Corona go away 2 months (Late September). spend October distracting parading conquering coronavirus. 

Won‚Äôt happen tho üò¨ can. Hubby interested Tesla. looking one morning thinking remain BMW family. Wow interesting. idea that's phase III works. Thanks info. lots lower division juco schools done investigate photo. Lock Middle eastern terrorists furiously looking youtube videos create virus. Even worse, know nurses kept jobs refusing flu shot. Translation: never control. could get virus control minutes nuked country. sad thing that's likely getting idiots mask up. so...you can't link it. 

You say google it, yet can't link it. 

at point I'm pretty sure trolling me. fucking love username, actually made laugh loud. Thank you, needed that. counting FL beaches, course. mean promising vaccines using traditional, tried proven method (not RNA) already phase 3 testing, think I'll wait those. even much. copy paste journal info posted. public article I‚Äôm Texas. Hello central united states! I'm introvert I'm honestly starting lose fucking mind. didnt think I'd miss occasional movie dining restaurant really do. wont act way tougher thought - 3 months going nowhere park (well distanced) grocery store wits end. Today, found cousin, healthy guy 40s, passed away due Covid-19. cousin also contracted virus.

 never able get gross negligence recklessness certain governments. death we've seen since December avoidable. 

And we're even close done. American government blood hands. great news. would even greater news fucktard medical doctors become aware power vitamin supplementation 3 times current upper limit. since threat pharmaceutical industry, hear health renegades like me. can't reopen strategically without planned economy. Unreal Cuomo gets pass Pfft, ok lol Reminds translators end making Trump sound intelligent can't politely represent moronic actually seem believable true already got Covid 19, can't get again? assume that's texas terminology ""mayor"".

relevant point though wear masks time public What‚Äôs more, People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs top expert biological warfare, Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, dispatched Wuhan end January help effort contain According PLA Daily, Chen researching coronaviruses since SARS outbreak 2003, well Ebola anthrax. would first trip Wuhan Institute Virology, either, since one two bioweapons research labs No, novel coronavirus causes COVID-19 biological weapon. mean virus escape article links shows concern existed discussed years. evidence clear Chinese Communist Party covered weeks extent coronavirus outbreak Wuhan, don‚Äôt know why. One emerging theory virus originated Wuhan lab. Beijing denies it, world deserves full accounting China knew when.

My advice is... best remain peaceful impossible situations. Stress good. Reach AG....They work help you. Even live one states it‚Äôs clusterfuck ‚Äî you‚Äôll lose nothing contacting people affect change. Tooths pliers fair CDC initially say masks help all. anybody paying attention obviously lying preserve limited supply medical personnel, really hurt reputation. reminder kick anyone see refuses wear mask neck hard Seatbelts protection others. Daddy going mad People aren‚Äôt forced wear masks. They‚Äôre *required law* wear masks, many people not. isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äòforce‚Äô make sure person keeps mask on. 

All contributors listed also play, multiplied mask non-compliance.  relatively safe one store maskless. Tad bit selfish though. Sadly, correct. I'm seriously hoping changes. current administration wake call Americans Population-adjusted numbers misleading different way. U.S. geographically huge country many cities, individually capable becoming virus hotspot. Whereas many smaller European countries lot population one two big cities. cities got hit early, spiked national per capita numbers quickly ‚Äî inverse happened NYC metro area got hit early, everywhere else largely untouched.

However, we‚Äôre seeing, nothing magical NYC, took really long time virus gain foothold Phoenix, LA, Houston Miami (among cities). virus burns country, per capita numbers going look like Belgium‚Äôs. disparate 2-3 months ago, talking point (‚Äúour virus response best West take NYC!) big justification opening Sun Belt states early.

We won‚Äôt know everyone over. riots largest effect. bet masks, year's flu season going much much better past years.  Good luck that, set coronavirus party That's honestly I'm wondering. enforced? anything done resist decision? NY Times Article morning said hospitals ordered send data directly HHS HHS would disperse data CDC.

Which people concerned director HHS (Trump puppet) may alter data sending CDC. else stop going CDC directly? Google damned article. gave journal, volume, issue page. 

You can't even pop terms google look article yourself? still need food pre-chewed, too?

And yet expect believe you, way shape form know talking about?

Lucky you, google. Here's data influenza vaccine:

"" Fever noted among 12 per 100 children aged 1 ‚Äì 5 years, 5 per 100 aged 6 - 15 years (Neuzil et al., 2001). adults rate these

12%, 1-2% either believe posted, open google. side carls per average gathering?  New Jersey 224 new COVID cases yesterday, Florida 12,624. 

The better state response main reason NJs numbers look much better many states Naw, someone else saying today Texas hospital morgues small...



And? pretty sure aren‚Äôt small regularly need fill parking lot mobile morgues handle overflow. Can't high covid cases covid deaths test report data. *Taps forehead Thanks thorough response Time put grandpa nursing home let real adult navigate us pandemic. bristol?

Thanks. joke point. thanks hoping best. could really use that. small town still thinks democratic hoax. Results fast tracked middle pandemic... need vaccine ASAP Decimated mean wasteland. setting infection, means large number people getting sick dying.

I'm sorry strong word 35,000 dead New Yorkers. word would prefer use? saw woman's dating profile one time said something along lines ""if wear name-tag work make less 100K year talk me."" 2017/18 caught flu, ‚Äújust flu‚Äù holidays around north Europe Christmas, new years‚Äô eve more... really bad went Norway even went hospital there, tested many viruses one hour told seasonal flu, bad flu. got 39¬∞ fever 25 days, completely wet night sometimes felt hard move. coughed hard cried coughing many days, got lots pills still continued cough 2 months, stomach really hurt that... 20s preexistent conditions, didn‚Äôt smoke too. 

0/5
I would recommend flu either, loosing days work, horrible times holidays, lots pain, bad feelings cries, would suggest try something else, maybe cold better choice. I‚Äôm one jacking death rates, you‚Äôre gonna keep basking weird enjoyment large scale tragedy, least punch argument build grammar. know I‚Äôm going get downvoted hell one situation authoritarianism necessary. I‚Äôm saying go North Korea condone level authoritarianism. make illegal public without mask fine anybody doesn‚Äôt conform. People shut suck real quick can‚Äôt go public without getting ticket giving hard earned cash. Put way - article crap, accomplish goal familiarizing people study, read want make mind. Oh absolutely agree! understand something seems basic grounded science coming hard people? Turkeys voting Christmas right, yes, seems much closer that. pissed Trump twisted words put clarifying statement everyone watches Fox News. Ok holy fuck it‚Äôs full war American people every human.

Hey world leaders: FIGHT DONALD TRUMP EVERYTHING HAVE. won‚Äôt fog since seal face like n95 mask. glasses fog wearing n95 mask means wearing correctly putting self others risk exposure. Many asymptomatic pediatric cases also positive CT scans lungs. would assume results scar tissue potentially permanent damage. could create life-long issues especially older ages (lungs mature around 20-25 start losing capacity 35).

I've also read articles/reports perfectly healthy divers came 'mild' COVID never able dive due decreased lung function. may serious adult survivors feeling like going pass trying make lunch basic task. would imagine many still able function normally noticeable lung scarring simply lung function started really good with; say feeling hit 40 - 80+ age groups. sorry. Can‚Äôt help study links wouldn‚Äôt waste time trying convince anti-vaxxer Correct. Competent adults could.

That's majority US, every single COVID death fucking \*proves\* it. NO! -Abbot Eventually. matter many get sick die first, get act together. Honestly wear fucking mask. get small percentage can't people selfish assholes. one wants wear mask, they're hot uncomfortable wear one protect others..have respect we'll get together.  point trump issue. Think people actually making happen. Wtf America üòî  20 stocks back 19 bucks. Initially thought would good long term hold think majority students want go back honestly Right surprised see GOP gov admit lay argument well. selfish unaffected losing emergency services. wake up? Well Disney land open. Wonder difference CA FL hmm Every day sounds appealing. Correct... look way crossing road take chance..or look one way.. data missing make decisions based data have. I'd rather kill idiots fucking stupid wear mask!! training camp starts two weeks know half it, AutoModerator school district good job. board members voted opening without masks social distancing ones referring to. understand districts implement stricter rules, good. really option right now. exhausting man 

Believe whatever want. gave science. It;s fault know read it. 

If gets approved, permission get uncomfortable it. nice night. better things do, like watching paint dry. COVID-19 cases surge deaths rise, experts say everyone must compliant guidelines slow spread. widespread testing increases, there's longer wait get results. know Florida got caught trying force manipulation data.

I easily see trump administration saying data belongs refusing disclose information September October launching numerous lawsuits won‚Äôt get resolved it‚Äôs always describe extroverted introvert, occasionally really want go out, mostly I‚Äôm fine home. I‚Äôve gone necessities, I‚Äôm furlough, I‚Äôve going store twice month. one day I‚Äôve really stir crazy took four mile walk get out, expose much fuckery. can‚Äôt understand people need go bars three days week feel alive. Yup, definitely Starbucks.
Just someone greets ""Welcome Costco, love you."" mean they're offering blow you. Keywords ""could"" ""everyone"" Oh okay. Imagine followers held accountable like former administration students may well wear masks school? want *them* go strike?

sheeeeeeeeeeeeeit hit think people forget children get sick many toddlers see wearing masks parents wearing one. really take them, anything, literally anything cover face instead letting hurt health getting disease likely don‚Äôt understand full consequences of! purposefully left recent articles, here's happened US media generally reports Johns Hopkins data, higher lower given day Worldometer. either points point. percentage put ventilators live, roughly? That‚Äôs brave Lindsey-dear. Keep up, find moral center, someday might become
a real man. Yes, sold trump masks. would make shit ton. sure didn‚Äôt go route make money it. ounce prevention that. 103.28 degrees serious apparently. Correct, parents used spend time children. Women also taking brunt they're average giving jobs (or laid off) take care kids feel rolling back lot progress made past decades. 

Better teacher's take risk take hit paychecks though. /s

Forgetting whoever opens first child/teacher/staff member dies it'll hell school board. Also one child gets sick there's good chance everyone class + teacher quarantine. US lightning rod right suspect within couple months opening schools would closed anyway due lack staff. No, parodying right lol. sane world post would obviously sarcasm, are... There's reason BCC invented email. I'm even anti-vaxxer. something got released late October, I'd probably get unless manufactured something ridiculous like Trump Pharmaceuticals would still skeptical effectiveness. sounds like family treats me....gloom doom meanwhile love play dumb truth  average positive rate. average every state maybe, certain places definitely need testing. ~~War~~ *Pandemic* Northern ~~Aggression~~ *Vacation*

Yay revisionism! dream hooking even .000000001 tried conservative Asshole Proportionality Distribution. ;) Ted Cruz would want hide face behind mask times shame. Hell, shit beard would want behind mask too. Oh really? Didn‚Äôt know that. That‚Äôs tho learn it. 

I trying find people job actually cleared virus it‚Äôs dormant?

They really mild symptoms like headache, cough, etc. mean 20 years ago, MERS one 2012 there's lot anti-vaxxers days always nasty anti science Karens Facebook? Alaska surprisingly good freezer capacity. lots fish processing plants Alaska could freeze half population state came that. live currently 70 degrees outside, leaving bodies outside definitely work. We're 100 new cases/day things still getting started. people believe things could never get bad Texas, even though Walmarts, bars, supermarkets fast food joints rest nation. ignorance willful. Yeah, we're going way past 150k. I'm pretty sure they've suspended terminated function response pandemic. also used way cash miles 3rd party gift cards (albeit terrible rate compared using miles flights), definitely got rid pandemic hit.

AA worst major US carriers, that's saying something.  casualties Covid young 11 sadly. Please brush off. I'd rather overprepare see needless deaths MUH FREEDUMB cells don‚Äôt make antibodies. Brit actually full math numbers last week (at time) tested like 10% population yet still hear people screaming numbers low. Well curtains pulled back way can't see everything window.

I think smart thing base numbers incomplete data still scream. already control quite harmless. Also Mississippi already one unhealthy states country. Yeah Florida lot old people tend get wealthy retirees northeast shape life healthy.

I'm south many people born raised little towns never leave literally exercised since last game sport played high school senior year. even 30 gut pushing steering wheel wheeze walking Wal-Mart park toward back lot. Enjoy ride, whores. yeah see!!!! Ministry peace too. 

It‚Äôs insane. read 1984 years ago, it‚Äôs applicable current administration. can't shoot viruses guns :'( fired actually. Wish took picture photoshop 300lb pound woman. Spread google. Yep. big deal. idea long antibodies last. It‚Äôs entirely possible last longer would natural infection (especially since two doses vaccine). too, thinking that's nothing compared 10000 couple days ago bad movie plot would win Golden Raspberry Award Least Realistic Drama. staying obvious order try stay relevant I‚Äôm fine that. take first test make sure it‚Äôs safe. That's annoying thing it. know solve issue. We've seen work elsewhere. whatever reason. Even political standpoint understand think dragging virus November better biting bullet weeks. followed protocol months ago, virus would contained schools businesses could open uniformly. None government done made sense, angle. new information came 3 months regarding masks effectiveness vs virus that‚Äôs around forever? Lol  10%! Even ""at least"" optimistic sort! 

Good you.  USA. Selfishness country. Usually. case, lot sold almost stocks. might cause none envisioned stock price high. invest biotech lot, uncommon board members buy even unvested options. People may, MAY listen wouldn‚Äôt talk pomposity. sort point could goes window self-aggrandize calling ‚Äúrenegade‚Äù.

As bio-hacking, long go evidence say ‚Äúoh, guess doesn‚Äôt work?‚Äù least means catch often adults. much theory kids catch often Trump said COVID cases going zero couple weeks Wouldn‚Äôt sure. Inland California serious lockdown it‚Äôs supposedly seeing record numbers cases. 

And live - confirm super markets bigger stores haven‚Äôt allowed people unmasked months roads empty normal standards. find reasons use good word. It‚Äôs basically Japan did, comparable population size. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs simple anymore half dozen hotspots. Japan didn‚Äôt single hotspot . . . I'm feeling similar see numbers state. 700 used limit cases comfortable going out, first 1400 hit, soon 2100s, look forward Sunday lull 1400 hope dates bad  percentage people wear masks? many countries managing pandemic well proving disaster. 

Japan (about 1/3 population US) 890 deaths (compared US' 139,000 deaths). 

There's still time adopt/mandate safety procedures work. put things full reopen schools open... going disaster. Russian ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù fact, theory. Chinese conspiracy lie. Funny lambs think they‚Äôre woke ones. alone, went golfing NH last week guy proshop said:

""You boys need wear mask here, fact I'm likely kick someone wearing one."" I'm sure half joking, kick customer money... He's running like one many failed businesses. Except time can't file bankruptcy flee money.


On another note, moron bankrupted casino. fuck bankrupt fucking casino, house always wins. Great. Fine. perish guess. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve doing. don‚Äôt need go bar enjoy drink. scenery nice sometimes, view patio. Heck, beer store near pretty decent selection alcohol slushees too...I‚Äôll go one almost dozen craft brewers area....gotta help too. Seems like brainier. Wear masks open shit back wait vaccine. Heros get expensive yo I‚Äôm knocking initially stated masks weren‚Äôt necessary. Doctors good medical research. 100 year start Spanish flu still don‚Äôt many answers meaningful protections place. I'll take 40% chance fever 1-2 days opposed potential lung damage. Hell even 100% chance, fever big deal. Many years ago (I 11 think) visited grandma hospital major surgery. ventilator never forget: 

A couple minutes room, mom (her daughter) ""talking with"" grandma. Well shortly after, woke absolutely traumatized living fuck outta me. 

She sat up, grabbing tubes, struggling muffled cries. mom nurse pushed button calmed mother residential staff arrived. 

I ran room crying needed picked family member. 

Grandma survived 93. love miss her, goddamn, ventilators scare shit me. 

I wish (and also *do wish*) people could experience like put damn mask 3 million cases China?
Where 130k+ dead China?

We worse China. would‚Äôve like ‚Äúeww what?! you‚Äôre gonna stick fist ass?! Eww guy talking fisting ass! kids here‚Äù nah 2012. Large parts Florida essentially NEVER closed. red koolaid pretty strong Florida.

Hold up. yep, looks true 


 Lmao. live stupidest times. *trump regime one simple way: $$$... said antibody levels encouraging, side effects unusually bad. 

but know that, even trying spin it. 

Are scientifically ignorant understand vaccine effective reasonably safe? one two things enough. 

And yet ignore part unusually-large side effects focus one sentence efficacy?

It's starting seem like interested real conversation this. seems like agenda want truth. Mississippi‚Äôs population also lot smaller Florida‚Äôs, despite significant land area. They‚Äôll blame people following suggestions. play right face say idea inevitable would happen. Either way, won‚Äôt them. doesnt look good getting second time population 


 trying kill people? I‚Äôm sorry....but....no.

Can‚Äôt reason stupid, abundant supply that. mentioning previous projections us like 12,500 maximum total cases Wuhan. 4140 maximum total deaths US. Basically we've shattered every *maximum* projection. look graph see 17632 beds needed curve compared 20184 beds available Florida. That's Oct 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess historical evidence says we'll 200% Florida's population October 1. Somehow, doubt Florida struggle manage that. Show article linked below. blows away study done April outbreak S. Korea March nd yet news reports U.S. show beaches outdoor locations whenever talk spikes reopening. Meanwhile, strongly believe offices America's silent spreader. one U.S. media politicians want discuss reason.

Simply breathing recirculated air office infected individuals leads infection. Take note almost nobody used common areas infected. lobby elevators - hell, people separated break area inner offices side floor! - see much COVID transmission. close sat together long. Airborne Ok thanks info. skeptical ‚Äúnot high risk‚Äù claim I‚Äôll wait come see saying. CDC alone. Canada, government also told us masks helpful unnecessary (outside hospitals).

I honestly think West complacent believed sort Western exceptionalism whereas Asian countries scared fuck encouraged mask usage way earlier.

I understand evidence efficacy masks Covid-19 sparse earlier year, fact even try preventative measure till virus gotten control really damning. Oh forget thanksgivings November. USA Total Wipeout 2020. people base entire identity contrarian

Tucker Carlson shit time (including around masks!), recently broke kind record audience size. American right , especially living South like playing life Ultra Nightmare mode. I'm worried people lasting damage covid getting flu.  Sorry hear boomer parents idiots. Please lump everyone one group please. way assholes get butthurt labeled millennials whatever. ...and I'm sure they're right! UCLA able see future. don‚Äôt option banning protests they‚Äôre explicitly protected constitution. Thank saying this! I'm sure making nobody wears masks here. There's fair percentage people, I'd guess much,much cities wear them. Even beehive full people wearing them. There's reason one least hit cities think lot behaviour people fact counting chickens long hatched No, realize going tens thousands body bags gets us this. 

There many God Damn morons America hope compliance mask wearing, body bags is. people love they're told they're allowed do.

 people love they're told to. 

The virus counter humanity's defiance. per capita measurements. per capita measurements demonstrate clearly US horribly. California (at least, entire state) top three, population, not. reported 9,194 cases 133 deaths Monday. Texas added 7,489 cases 59 deaths. California recorded 5,063 cases 40 deaths.  Tuesday evening, Los Angeles County alone announced [a new single day record 4,244 cases 73 deaths](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=2506).  also big increases new cases recent weeks, reported 4,273 infections 92 deaths.

Florida's population: 21.48 million. Texas: 29 million. California: almost 40 million.

9194/21.48=428 cases per million  
7489/29=258 cases per million  
5063/40=126 cases per million

LA county's population: 10 million. 4244/10 = 424.4 per million.

As another example, live Santa Clara county, population almost 2 million. Santa Clara TOTAL 6725 cases. new cases one day 248, 124 per million. (And much happy rise we've had, spent May June 2000s TOTAL cases we've completely fucked it. gonna get worse leaders scared shut down.)

Some states comparison, data  \- scroll per-million population graph US states (and highly recommend comparing countries states per-million graphs: clearly demonstrates worst rolling averages recently almost US states. add US state countries graph one links graph).

Arizona come Monday 186.4 per million; previous days 348.6, 417.4, 579.9, 7-day rolling average high 400s per million. (Compare Florida's 7-day rolling average low 400s last days, recently spiking 500.) Louisiana next, South Carolina vying Texas, Georgia, Alabama. Highlight California find plus Tennessee, Idaho, Nevada, Mississippi.

Sorry rant, Bothers states worse enormity California, people paying attention they're distracted populous state cases. Per capita numbers tell whole story, unimportant. Idk try compassion toward people ENOUGH ARTICLE!!!!

Here another study 700 hospital employees Hannover. Less 1 % hospital employees covid antibodies. working hospital lessens chance infection? Don' think so. studies nice, designed find children less prone infections not. 

This particular study school children Dresden snap shot certain region certain time frame. Schools locked immediately beginning first wave, never full lockdown rest population. people still went work. necessarily sign kids get less infected. rather shows full lockdowns suppress infections people still working.

Also first wave consisted mainly people returning party hit spots / Ski resorts. place families kids spent holidays. Football? they‚Äôre bunch babies handle it.

You learn socialize without going out. don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it. They‚Äôre petulant children. need that? That's job national guard already system place hospitals directly input data CDC.

I don‚Äôt mind sharing did.

First, studied immunology learning lobbying moonshot initiative 2016. I‚Äôm lobbyist like lawyer, think community member passionate issue. 

Immunology boosts immune system fight cancer whereas chemotherapy nukes cells body hopefully kill cancer cells. Immunology well researched approach chemotherapy showed promise.

I looked active stage 2 immunology clinical trials. studies success warrant investigation.

I went things thought useful. study looked breast cancer similar, something feel would really useful. Studies looked lesser prevalent diseases, either research moved on.

I looked company share prices one cheap ($5 less) bought. not, move on. Rinse repeat times year.

If things go stage 3 trials, stocks get boost. sell wait. pass stage 3 trials, takes years FYI, get huge boost since product sell.

You cash offer dividend keep that. usually reports passed trial leak file report that‚Äôs good time leave.

Then, take money, rinse repeat. 

Also, nice group stable stocks offer dividend safe. Find companies offer products services know useful invest them.

Historically, at&amp;t example healthy dividend. blue origin SpaceX stock, I‚Äôd run away telecoms fast. 

What‚Äôs next hit, I‚Äôd say take flyer think useful. dad asked invest money refuse don‚Äôt want risk money.

Wow... wow. ""And DHS going manipulate numbers make look fine matter CDC ain't getting data anymore."" Indeed. still 736 new deaths 1500 new hospitalizations. care,

But:

1. important remember racist forces (such drug laws mandatory minimum sentencing) keep Black Brown communities lower classes.
2. doctor less likely believe favorable towards patient color due implicit bias, even within economic brackets, people color still deal least extra disadvantage.

Granted, know issue, COVID's serious detrimental effects communities color also class-based (someone please correct I'm wrong), important remember racism classism disguise (not necessarily believe exact statement, I've found even less true I'd previously thought research). fact, I've come believe racism causes classism classism causes racism.

I highly recommend Dr. Ibram X. Kendi's ""How Antiracist"" Michelle Alexander's ""The New Jim Crow."" Even agree them, they're important understanding modern discourse around racial justice. careful staying inside past months like me. takes ONE FUCK WRONG TIME WRONG PLACE catch shit.

Yes vaccines flue's. Infact every year cocktail expected years dominant strains.   Convenient works huh? chart need comparing Mondays previous Mondays, Tuesdays previous Tuesdays, etc.... Tomorrow Thursday time highs likely point ballpark 200/day mid-next week.

Worldmeter shown overestimate cases deaths daily basis. example, June 9th, Worldmeter reported NJ 106 deaths, governor literally tweeted 28 deaths. false data still there. great see data updated real time, see overall trends, lead information that's factual. 

COVID Tracking Project showed deaths went \~200 today, pretty significant difference. fact Worldmeter shows inflated numbers would help gloomers sub, reason use religiously. could get control 2 weeks everyone stayed home 2 weeks.... Yes. want get end quickly possible get back work driving economy. people hide homes slow process them. Idaho closed rest big states. shut 2 weeks Trump made ""his"" suggestion. Yolo, gimme vax.

2 days ago...probably. Cant give 100%. could call testing place doctor.
9 days ago...probably not.

I'd prob get tested 9 days ago...but results taking 4-7 days sucks. Yeah point vaccine kind flu.

IL here, took covid test july 1st cvs minute clinic, still results im lied every time call. feds time also confiscating ppe states purchasing shipped. mailbox single family house? I'd feel like fine, doctor specializing infectious diseases would know best.

A mailbox apartment building? Yeah, mask up. wonder we're gonna see abrupt, unpredicted decline cases.  pneumonia one year couple years back every time gotten sick since always end cough end needing steroid for. help asthma well RemindMe! 50 days ‚ÄúIs Google Earth still up?‚Äù lives orange soda? already think train wreck propaganda, you‚Äôre smart go riot dumb go church Every single credible medical expert says wearing mask helps prevent spread deadly disease.
Your ""studies"" fake.
Stop stupid. lot people care. Unfortunately charge looking lines pockets. thanks do. Keep speaking. Well come North. closed.  linked brain damage? know GOP fine opening everything up. Don‚Äôt know would classify rather well since world lost tens millions people. Transportation also infantile compared today. today‚Äôs global transportation death rate could 10x November numbers going look great, except maybe liberal states.

All coronavirus data going routed Trump admin instead CDC going forward, hell going know badly disease spreading. happen people acting like children country get sick die family members start dropping dead. Ironically end wrecking economy, force businesses go bankrupt. rights? wow groundbreaking news, thanks brodie  find adorable weird way. I'm deeply introverted, often feel like struggle social expectations. Now, everyone forced live manner resembles preferred mode existence, they're fucking *freaking out*. ""Sir, something, may seriously affects kids' future lives""

""Meh, throw pile shit ruin future"" bother read study leaders democracy serve consent citizens. far guess Americans apparently still giving consent... Hard understand outside looking in, guess. travel while. Shame u!

Tut tut tut They‚Äôre definitely thinking outside box ways reduce amount abortions. eye thing people r/covid19positive talking today. ‚ÄúA person smart. People dumb, panicky dangerous animals know it.‚Äù -Agent K MIB deliberately spreading conspiracy theories reduce trust vaccines, uninformed? divested (sold) shares 2 months ago accepted position avoid conflict interest. He‚Äôs fucking good dude:

""Dr. Slaoui resigned position independent member Board Directors Moderna. Further, directed divestiture equity holdings Moderna sale effective tomorrow morning,"" Caitlin Oakley, HHS spokeswoman told CNBC Monday. 

""Furthermore, Dr. Slaoui committed donate cancer research incremental value accrued Moderna shares evening Thursday, May 14, prior announcement position Operation Warp Speed time sale, scheduled tomorrow morning,"" Oakley said. previously reported Slaoui volunteer time, paid government.

Moderna representatives confirmed Slaoui's plans, telling CNBC: ""Dr. Slaoui divesting equity interest Moderna conflict interest Dr. Slaoui new role. wish Dr. Slaoui well new role, know lot contribute nation - world - address COVID-19 J RPG? %1000 this. also escaped situation like that, going back home like visiting another planet. seems like baloney excuse, masks -gone- cdc saying didn‚Äôt need wear them. 

There giant supply n95 shelves would bought some. tried! sold out. supply chain wiped out, prioritized future shipments first responders. CDC director: U.S. could get coronavirus ""under control"" 4-8 weeks everyone wears masks

So... basically impossible?! 5G.  Q.  party. thing else.  Always.  buck stops everywhere else type excuses people. Germany established rule kid showing symptoms sickness, stay home right precaution  country whole ""thank service"" stuff actually somewhat surprising reluctant many people part fighting virus. doubt US nowadays would able successfully deal WW2 like situation large parts population drafted service greater good. forced fight war far away home much larger infringement personal freedom wearing piece cloth mouth nose. Florida opening quickly aggressively led spike cases. 

This seriously common sense. take Harvard doctor know this. Hey, Washington teach blame everyone guys charge generations. even blame them? looking random 2016 county results Illinois, seems like lot around 70% republican. 90%. None 80% democrat. don‚Äôt think stereotype ‚Äúeveryone doesn‚Äôt live cities uneducated bigots‚Äù really fair true. assuming every single republican agrees ‚Äúthis fine‚Äù. isn‚Äôt true. Rural people different concerns issues, almost nowhere vote way cities do. Say pointing finger face, arms straight perpendicular body. universally shame-inducing gesture. Gov Ron DeSantis Pinellas. hope knows he's leading old stomping grounds disaster. Shame. understand they‚Äôd wanna go back way things were

But that's option anymore thanks, large part, people. need suck fuck like rest us stop throwing temper tantrums going keep resetting progress clock thing. What's worse would bet *anything* would people going resistant vaccince ever get far. abundant evidence effectiveness back Fauci, CDC advised wearing masks bcoz supposed ineffectiveness.  mean space force right ;) Arizon, Florida, Texas walks bar, without masks... Morgan Freeman: didn't... understand heart tbe right place viruses become less lethal become better fighting them. virus already asymptomatic host species asymptomatic spreaders evolutionary pressure kill host there. mention plague evolve past wiped significant portion humanity would gave scientific cultural advances keep check. scares quite frankly trust white house atleast administration experience, level close-mindedness independent amount education. mean look situation right Canada, easily comparable neighbor got COVID time.

Right US recording 60,000 new cases day... Canada around 200 1/9 population. really horrible days April crept close 3000, actually probably would surpassed data back accurate. yeah weeks lost 2000 people day :-\ deaths least issues virus. long term consequences health economy based many people get ill, way bigger number dead people major impact everyone large people get ill time. frustration reopening, kids adult, kids hard control themselves.

I saw even kids mask, occasionally touch faces others' unconsciously, sort unavoidable unless tie up.... suspicions accurate. Fauci saying start, explain week ago front congress, thats main argument used discredit him. Poor guy explanation recorded doesnt expend effort every time. probably would retrospective study, actual challenge study feel like PTSD. I'm infectious disease geneticist, nobody listened Jack shit said. 

I think anyone cares. Nobody cares long term effects. People afraid look reality what's happening.  EXACT EVENT CDC exists for! Fuck Trump Trump followed guidance. think Trump making himself? Yeah, unfortunate people can't decent realize average human need 1,000 N95 masks. Staying home, social distancing simple cloth covering would do. But... look happened toilet paper actual logical reason panic buy that. IMHE modelling utter trash entire pandemic. set drives Tesla‚Äôs stock price certain point, he‚Äôll get massive bonus. Must nice work problem investors buying smaller practices turning physician groups basically mid-sized businesses executive team, investors, tons admin bloat. people sitting board otherwise active voice *American Academy Pediatrics* days. 

The owners investors businesses taking home measly $200k year. 

This practice widespread physicians offices rapidly consolidated causes whole host issues. like industries, power money going hands few. anyone theory behind likes UK Belgium CFR \~15%, opposed world average \~5%?

Initially thought countries testing worst affected (ie. hospital admissions) far case look testing numbers.

Is purely post mortem testing? example, UK routinely swabbing every death registering COVID death comes back positive, even John Doe got shot face?

I know hard compare countries baffling me... end United States written Trump wins election. destroying country. Blame Ron DeSantis‚Äô incompetency ignorance. nearly 400 posts **/The Donald**, actually care never said family cares, said dont assets give. make assumptions like that. religious war. done before. People going die name god, case god ""freedom"". who? agree reversal. see fair, though. 

American primary education worst world. American kids disadvantage better prepared international students richer anyway. Perhaps wake call necessary revamp American middle high schools, algebra still optional. Legal representation means lot. There's lot shit go south teacher unions saved many teachers ass sued, fired, accused misconduct, accused follows IEPs 504 plans. There's unions striking. agree bullshit take license striking, make unions useless. problem, keep passing torch. First it‚Äôs Washington, New York, Florida. Who‚Äôs next? California? Texas? One Dakotas because? Time wear trash bag, mask, gloves, face shield, know. I'm high risk too. voting. Obviously study, study also inconclusive. **MAY** intelligent? Yeah FL might end #1 epicenter whole world covid. would stay away Floridians starting beg people come there. problem KN95 need accredited KN95 status Independant body. manufacturer declares KN95 not. same, one trip facebook see everything fake virus bat coin? makes head hurt. lean towards protecting children's health welfare able get firm understanding disease. young people invincible believe? economically fear!  nearly 200,000 posts total. else got?

You seem crusade cut paste tirades unrelated subreddits. false. countries in-person classes like Japan everyone wearing masks ill-effects. don‚Äôt know places, Chicago area, already becoming trend wear mask work felt weather, well enough work - fever, common cold, infections controlled medication (e.g. Strep throat).

Cook County coronavirus cases county nation. thanks. seeing first 2 paragraphs reason.  title misleading, physical resource shortage, issue factories bottling soda bottle much. Consumption canned bottled spiked 30%, shortages.  demand used covered restaurants via soda machines.

The easiest way make people happy suspending making least popular products make popular products. public health.

So many people fucked every way economically Christmas exist year.

Neither Thanksgiving, birthdays matter. unreal, idea - thanks sharing info Mission accomplished WH... antibodies immune? whole point vaccination? immune, mask up? Previously John Hopkins university received data physicians social media - agree structured data collection system would beneficial. You‚Äôre probably right, even doesn‚Äôt seem popular opinion. say it, I‚Äôve really seen surprisingly reports outdoor spreader events especially scale you‚Äôd imagine. super crowded BLM protests example resulted lots infections, even number people wear masks. didn‚Äôt.

Still, considering irrational people behave soon give kind leeway, it‚Äôs probably best play safely possible. Next thing read people start coughing other‚Äôs mouths kind social media challenge... us unreal, idea - thanks sharing info acronym favourite. taken DILLIGAF FISHMO.

Surprisingly enough, DILLIGAF FISHMO seem favourite acronyms bug businesses power. kill it. instant. Also AC helps spread around move about. true. virus strain lethal communicable. That's great! 

However one post down, says US decided ignore CDC Covid-19 data.

Basically, itvdoesn't matter CDC says. government says listen CDC ignore anything. assure you. someone actually understands world bothers me. 

You person screaming ‚ÄúHillary vampire wants eat children! Here‚Äôs article it! explain I‚Äôm wrong!! (then I‚Äôll link three insane articles)‚Äù

You don‚Äôt understand science. glom onto details misinterpret way 3rd grader might call guy proved global science wrong. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm smarter anyone!‚Äù

No. Professionals professionals reason. could explain errors logic bombarded rounds idiocy (an idiot) thinks clever. wish could effected reason. Capit√°n Hindsight WHO, CDC, IPCC... Can't trust idiots study entire lives work premier scientific institutes you. much worse Nixon, Nixon fucking terrible.

Guarantee prosecuted statue erected honor

You always see pictures past presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump going throw shitfit completely ignored, hopefully rot prison rest life Boycott Trump! okay cutting diet products ie lowest selling good guys die this? Less 2/3 UK population Yeah live too. geographical isolation definitely helped keep case count down, mask mandate shouldn‚Äôt hard implement anywhere, especially places *so much worse* right now. obviously know teachers. know fucking job. find martyrs professions. know makes teaching unique? Everyone grows going school watching teachers, everyone thinks know job. Feeling called something passionate something make person martyr. make $300 every day teach. I'm reliably every weekend, holiday, summer. 

I'm fucking martyr intend sacrifice economy. spouse makes good money I'm position many teachers. acting like big deal ti lose license barred profession. Save fucking judgement. want teach, want die. could just, know, vote ever want travel again. site I've using monitor mortality rates: Table 1 show number deaths decreasing significant amount time? Says 181 deaths last week? info wrong? I‚Äôm looking instant gratification tho. make lit ? LA‚Äôs getting hit hard likely protests around city packed. wore masks many not. Also masks help much anyway. Look photos Hollywood protest. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise protest super spreading even. Especially since protesters drove parts city carpooled out. 

Another thing consider far protests go. you‚Äôre protesting huge crowds taking risk. protesting go back home quarantine likely socialize people? would think latter. You‚Äôre right hoarding healthcare worker stuff. data co yes flow in, changed position. It‚Äôs science works.  yes, plenty unknowns comes antibodies. IDK, CDC saying one thing. uncle Bob saying another. Hard know trust. Unfortunately would difficult actually prove. test virus really say let alone prove someone got infected. Probably beyond reasonable doubt.  ""look economy!"" 

Said friend mine recently Democrat's fault. thought, don‚Äôt actually care Fauci 100% right time, fact don‚Äôt expect be. expect assimilate ongoing changing information don‚Äôt training experience understand make recommendations based expertise. Even he‚Äôs wrong, opinion still valuable probably accurate political figure, own. IQ, make great cop*

*only USofA though. course are. Well always right... can‚Äôt believe patience still there... reckon covid bigger anyone thought üí≠ instead telling people wearing mask works, plase panic buy touch hand. completely downplay importance mask make Trump happy time still remain blameless. genius politician lol dollar every time phone changed word ‚Äúducking‚Äú‚Ä¶. ü§£ America selfish sort measure. would inclined believe, street could lose 80% residents couple 30 years wouldn‚Äôt even care, long don‚Äôt delicate nasal passages offended slight discomfort about, wearing mask like proper countries spanked CoViD-19 did.

Especially given CoViD-19 unlike anything else before. amount lingering issues causes every 1 death:

‚Äî 19 hospitalizations

‚Äî 18 /w permanent heart damage

‚Äî 10 /w permanent lung damage

‚Äî 3 given strokes

‚Äî 2 neurological issues affect memory.

‚Äî 2 neurological issues affect eternal fatigue.


The best part blind public really is. either think they‚Äôre invulnerable dying ‚Äî they‚Äôll survive like majority 99%. define ‚Äúsurvival?‚Äù

What don‚Äôt consider, 23-yo swimming champion went Covid19 party month ago, got cool buddies ‚Äúget way.‚Äù

But now, permanent lung damage, hindering ability compete swimming. Who‚Äôs going pay additional healthcare may need rest life? longer focus studies he‚Äôs obtained memory issues? gets random blood clot leg needs amputated? 

The amount dangerous effects lingering issues related ailment scary. curve this.

Imagine 3 million dead. Really drop bucket versus 360 million. add another 100 million serious health complications result covid19? hospital system would undeniably overwhelmed.

Tell me, people contracting CoViD19 multiple times, many times body beat off, time sustaining permanent damage various parts system? survive end holes lungs, survive end fatigue gross struggle get half days. get couple months later. well fight off?

This herd immunity bullshit it‚Äôs downright arrogant foolhardy think proper way beat get assume you‚Äôll fine afterwards ‚Äî still don‚Äôt know much this. 

Absolutely mind-boggling US mentality surrounding this. income tax? things learned US (And especially Florida) last couple months... Classic Asiatimes CCP moment run tests kids? procedure?  Even everyone knows it, people going refuse wearing masks ‚Äúcan‚Äôt breathe‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôre taking away rights!‚Äù I‚Äôm ashamed American right now, really pushes every true patriot mosh pit we‚Äôre Look Florida handled numbers though. also possible early get reinfected. still clue full potential virus. Yikes. Would suck DeSantis' kid. Oh yay, contractor. could go wrong? Yea, scientists getting money lmao. Beyond that, I‚Äôd love know public financing anyone produces vaccine. could give gold would next thing pop ‚Äúobedience shows higher levels IQ people question stuff‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôve following directives provided CDC health officials, making pointless studies demean people don‚Äôt want follow dumb. Like it‚Äôs life, let want. They‚Äôre old enough take care themselves, it‚Äôs responsibility. Honest question. think competent Administration (Democratic Republican) would handled covid? 

Would half many deaths? Would unity wearing masks? still Baltimore.  \*lot\* old houses still lead paint. Predictably, ones poorer neighborhoods problem. 
Here's link whole video. think guy may something, cop using toy bullets. ask argentina venezuela beforehand, dont need first hand experience. Supremely ironic guy lied masks working, surely causing many infections deaths it.

Of course reddit downvoting comments pointing irony adds another layer it. Remember 9/11 Republicans voted take away almost privacy terrorism? Things changed. 

We China, subtle. lower ground disease gravitates expelled. raining solid proof ‚ÄúAmerican Exceptionalism‚Äù exceptionally stupid muddleheaded way shown responding Covid-19. Also news even minor cases covid may cause brain damage... fucked! happening? stopped expediting passports except life death emergencies. still apply still issuing passports standard situations, delays. 


11. apply now?

You still apply now, unless life-or-death emergency, experience delays receiving passport return citizenship documents previous passports, birth naturalization certificates. offer normal processing times phase three reopening Bible written 40 years death... couple things removed like love 30 year old prostitute. absolutely pandemic.

Just accept risk stay away old people. you‚Äôre high risk don‚Äôt expect run bar gym. again, they‚Äôve accepted risk. Canadian wants enter Canada without spouse that‚Äôs fine. Epic BeardMan, starring Danny Trejo. either sixth seventh grade wanted gross classmate, licked gym floor back tongue.

In high school, another student wanted chips, try get let go could steal them, licked hand. gross, also work. seniors.

Also high school, took several months repeated colds realized needed wash hands weight training.

I actually think really started washing hands often daughter, preemie. Instant hygiene paranoia. profound. point vaccine then? blowing smoke butts? Seems rather pointless. CDC said along. Like back February, said masks anything, knew lie save PPE health-care workers. consequences well-intentioned lie horrendous.

And CDC still say much masks protect well others. Even homemade cloth masks. simple things make effective, like nose-wire closer fit, filter pocket basic pm2.5 filter. make sound like wearing mask good boy scout deed, saving skin well. ‚ÄúMay be‚Äù?  I'm already working it. Seeing stupid fellow citizens pandemic sealed deal. finish degree, I'm applying citizenship elsewhere. Fuck hellhole. physician sees patients covid hospital setting. going make sure report local authorities correctly get paper regard deaths. put past Trump supporting touch admin follow exact order shift away dangerous mechanism. I‚Äôve seen turn Europe hundred cases per day. idea China, anyone, something better America incomprehensible. China failed coverup outbreak January, yet flawlessly July. Makes sense. Man, really wants free pornhub premium elections... first? least Oxford vaccine stage 3 trials already. Yeah it‚Äôs pretty sick think generation us. Scary think would happened additude fighting nazis young people today covid. We‚Äôd fucked bother keeping social distancing years trying catch flu. No? 40% people catch coronavirus symptoms all. Around 90+% sort symptoms recocer without medical help.
Death rate similar. Coronavirus contagious know single case symptoms free flu. people already forgot scientists said months ago, around 80% population eventually get it. safety measures overload health system. Eventually coronavirus become another virus alongside flu. going get it. year next year later. planning wear mask permanently avoid contact people life?
Also, everyone forgot already told back March? virus infect though EYES? need breathe in. people wearing masks thinking protect them. 
Btw studies also shows people wear masks less likely using commom sense, easier manipulate since beleave propaganda bs media throws them.
Im masks. I'm people's stupidity disability see things clearly. Mandatory negative tests flying. safer less restrictive. Antibodies speculated sustained, thus, you‚Äôd lose immunity. ü§Ø Old friends I'm shocked still job testing fiasco kicked things off. things sorted earlier would much different place. desperately hope history documents failures. won‚Äôt average totally stupid. Corona parties? Lol üòÇ Yup. Washington, guarantee we‚Äôre gonna see fuckton Idahoans fill hospitals Eastern WA, sick folks Spokane shift west on, goddamned Idahoans end causing Seattle area hospitals fill. 

In summary, fuck Idaho. Send help.  Press X doubt press X doubt it'll enforced Americans, cant normal, like rest us? please... keep feets Fahrenheits, least wear mask ffs. choke strings eat mask, nobody history anything ever issues oxygen breathing cloth face mask basically... we‚Äôre fucked Well that's strategy they're going stop satellite photos mass graves Totally agree. language tricky &amp; allow businesses still run encourage folks gather non essential businesses I'm sure researchers (and participants) know possible brain tumors prior trials. OP phase 2 trial, possible brain tumor showed one phase 1 trial participants trial reporting completed. Phase 1 trials use small amount participants, sometimes difficult find rare side effects.

Usually people participate trials tried available methods helping ailments. They're wits end looking answers. OP's case, auto-immune disorders extremely difficult manage. condition tried literally everything, often beneficial get trial instead waiting (possibly) successful hit market 5-10 years.

Phase 1 trials risky testing safety drug one really knows going affect much give you. Phase 2 trials, designed test efficacy treatment, usually bit safer researchers safety results phase 1. Phase 3 even safer 1 2, meant evaluate new treatment works comparison existing treatments.

It's trade off. Depending success treatment, phase 3 trials might much risk compared reward. work though?

I‚Äôm American forgive me, I‚Äôm LA bars stuff shut

Can drive like.. Bakersfield beer? Infect people go home? What...the...fuck Hospitals send data national international agencies.  Nope. things may make taller muscular, fatter.

If would blame added sugars decreased nutrients per calorie, might argument. True, longer goes, fought even Contrarian shits don‚Äôt understand effort use masks even got used automatically still feel like red blooded American rights intact. good cautious ^_^ Going vent real quick. Yes ordered malls close down. indoor malls closed. work door mall San Diego absolutely flooded. imagine it‚Äôs going get worse. sad Agreed.

Heck, even certain gyms like Crunch Fitness still open despite recent shut down. said takes 5 7 weeks pass away Covid infected

New York coronavirus deaths peaked April 8. order taken 5 7 weeks, infections would peaked mid-late February.

New York record first case March 1. first fatality March 14 stay-at-home order put place March 22.

I know, maybe we're lot better treating sick living lot longer virus, 5 7 week timeline seem fit know. media get report numbers

The media serve capitals interests good little enablers like buildup invasion Iraq Occupy disrespectful way, genuinely understand comment. Extinction level event? Wow? 0.4% mortality many treatments reduce mortality. Rather ill informed fear monger.
Even virus allowed spread across world uncontrolled ,it wouldn‚Äôt close ‚Äúextinction‚Äù level event. Lordy, tried That's one thing feel sad america. account, usa best place conduct vaccine test. China europe can't find enough ppl infected. Better dying without vaccine, doubt (if comes) vaccine, probably small minority thought months ago. travesty. telling 8 years cool  Could takes combination social distancing, masks, 4 months control virus   story lacking considerable amount information. family member Canada got mad wanting people wear masks. told person Canada US moving toward communism start start dictating. person also didn‚Äôt follow social distancing guidelines also doesn‚Äôt know anyone infected. Kill Facebook I-O think mistake. First, Fauci probably know POTUS well, need get support can. Second, work administration, without obvious incompetent government, find good is, maybe many people even know man. things happened since March make backbone flagman US COVID, focus media people moment, give many correct suggestions without influence politics Trump can't shit anymore. 

Dr. Fauci true Captain America. N95 masks reusable Pure speculation lasting damage beyond rare instances occur pneumonia. There‚Äôs lot panic alarmism this. ostrich bury head... I've social distancing since day born I'm smarter literally everyone around too. There's definitely enough stupid people support outcome. No, they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúOh, BLM protestors, won‚Äôt happen me.‚Äù Like Trump said, test anybody cases.

Just hide deaths one know. propourly, huh Ah yes, bad parents might need work provide roof kids head. certainly option allowing government risk lives lives everyone care opening schools.  Everything mentioned something fixed temporary problems. Death perm. stake here.  one single defensible reason open schools state country right now. ""Only .046% us population died due willful negligence!"" largely successful *authoritarian*. Trump *wannabe authoritarian* moron.

I think slightly accurate. Neither leader good, one competent specific way. weird Idiocracy safer timeline...? Looks like California rolling back.. sure specifics I'll admit honestly think i'd see wrong post. many people say Trump wanted people inject drink bleach, say that. get wrong said mostly dumb shit, asking Dr. Birx internal cleansing treatment doctors could perform. say say Dems behaving reacting crazy, too. can't really objective. like focusing getting many red lights choosing forget green lights. fauci seems like he's paid reasonably well. trying call puppet? calling fauci puppet? saying china paying fauci puppet? weird version child's play? 70+ people end waiting crew arrive staff flight's problem too. sat out..I pre existing condition didnt want gamble health ...instead donated money time, email reps senators etc. can. werent Covid, would def marching.  One way another herd immunity answer. get there. they're racist (they are), economics matter human lives do. people financially ruined medical bills, eviction crisis, etc., people desperate enough work even less they're making now, turn drives profit margins. wind what's essentially de facto indentured servitude millions people, fault own, wind debts impossible pay lifetimes. view anyone who's either old sick enough significant risk wealthy enough make drain society that's better dead anyways.

The belief issues rooted solely race, gender, ability, orientation, etc. keeps us talking economics. minorities mistreated (they are) disproportionately affected (they are) even talking fighting equity (we should), I'd argue divisions social issues created reinforced justify economic exploitation rather way around. People take reference I'm afraid care less articles like I'm already wearing mask public... so... good day! I'm going need talk r/wallstreetbets whole nothing priced thing.... cares election chances people perceive handling virus. actually suggesting Trump horse race lmao.

And yes US also underprepared, another Trump mistake. Thanks reminder. know Fauci lie order save American lives. admitted it. proof showing idea lie Trump forcing him? told Surgeon General lie also? Fauci? Thats lol. response truth-- defensive. Picking choosing want blame/excuse (D) front name politicizing pandemic. Cuomo defunded hospitals made cuts medicaid pandemic also let ICE terrorize latino community  Alternate headline: hero brings us business. doesn't, minimum wage worker expendable. Ok culturally don‚Äôt consider South. here. saw south, borders states south, similar weather, seeing similar slope curve new covid-19 cases. sure distinction considered ‚Äúsouth‚Äù intents purposes relevant conversation.

Let‚Äôs use term ‚Äúsun belt‚Äù geographically coincide spike cases.  yet 2 right wing problem growing near levels. made mad nearly downvoted impulse. Sounds like something Tom Cotton would say Cdc fucking clue less anything except whoever pays tells them. Small dick Dan Scavino does? I‚Äôve thinking lately agree. It‚Äôs backwards thinking things get worse people don‚Äôt accurate depiction virus assumption hide everything much possible, keep economy open much possible hopes hold push agenda election.    Lmao BS. just... sad. could getting back normal people responsible instead we're facing needless deaths... trying prove point or...... said heros. say valuable. Build wall!!! could nice things! could nice things!  someone knows many sent Arizona?  Fauci admitted made decision lie himself. Trump understand care enough hospitals make Fauci lie anyway. Stop talking ass. Oh it'll take way longer that.. think 4-8 weeks best case scenario really would get ""manageable"" again. going much longer ride. literally everything destroy USA? 50% enough help? something even 5% chance reducing chances people know getting sick would it. Water? Like toilet? 2 billion IUs ü§£

#THAT‚ÄôS FUCK-LOAD VITAMIN D! Read report. Neutralizing titers vaccine boost start decrease weeks boost. Also poor cell response. vaccine certainly sterilizing months. Dont get hopes up. Opening schools going $hitshow. Yea I'm sure smoking something sure......it shows. hat though...‚ÄùKeep America Great‚Äù, country burns. none people wearing masks. Living heart Tennessee, Jesus racism; first half think immune due divine intervention second half stupid realize actual thing, like civil rights.  evidence trying preserve mask supply. 

but that's told public! told us effective. changed story supply increased. called lying. whatever. brain wont accept cognitive dissonance wrong. get that. - go big boy pants on.

Saying something know untrue called lie. go read dictionary. Fauci knew masks effective told us . LIE. it. I'm dumb enough wait realize error though.

what's error? know lie keep making excuses Fauci lied public effectiveness masks? went Morning shows ADMITTED lied told us why! jesus, brain must exhausted mental gymnastics go thru keep sad. Also interesting consider, vaccine available offer first worst areas, themselves, thereby punishing responsible it? would biggest net positive effect. us states good job possibly ride longer since others wont help themselves. But...but...MAH FREEDOMZ  Clean mircowave first unless want smelling last Lean Cuisine ate. Let's pretend pandemic hurricane instead, see (USA) did:

My first decree smart guy poke fun people social distance. Sad true. Think people thinks fake made up. Literally zero common sense. given proof (ex hospitals filling up, experts research virus etc) still can't make brain think box. shows dumb humans really are. Another victim media narrative.

The reality overall Chicago safe city average person, violence gets ridiculous amount press confined like, 2 neighborhoods that, unless live there, people 0 reason them. talking dad works lot small midsize businesses told lot businesses take PPP money even need it. Slap face do...  thinking this. Whitehouse wants one disseminating covid statistics, yeah, stats start looking better. China won. social distancing wearing mask everywhere, title rubs wrong way.

For everything, there's always article goes something along lines ** People [do things group does], may intelligent.** like **People stay late may intelligent.**. big brain pissing contest. Like whole Rick Morty copy pasta. time riot streets! complete bullshit! ignorance bliss think okay good people able vent miss regular life. realistic expect people totally content losing almost social interaction. 

My friends &amp; vent much hate literally time. healthy coping mechanism. ....Is good bad? brings interesting question! survive 2020, play Trump inevitable movie 5 years? Asking friend. even need particularly well vastly better US point. Look UK, example: abysmal mask compliance, delayed lockdown entry, current infections estimated [low-ish 4 figures (that's *confirmed* cases - dropped 400 yesterday - that's estimate total number people who've actually got (the figures page cover England, add 20% rest country).  actually intelligence work. suspect, like many intelligent people, underestimate inate intelligence. doubt would make hard obtain, especially want open things keep open. encouraging news :) Karma ‚Äújust flue‚Äù bros Queue incoming link found Facebook whatsapp Keep saying that's gets political justification defining cutting it.

Public education, even flaws, works people would support it, parents try ""buck"" thinking things like even needed child smarter teachers already. understand that! get flu, I'll fine. pass flu parents need minor medical help ain't damn medical help available they're full COVID cases - be...sort bummer. imagine. floor made floor Every 60 seconds minute passes Africa. Lets see 

Deaths morning 136446 deaths lagging usual. total deaths 1918 pandemic approximately 675,000 United States. TX FL trying tread water right possible. depending much data gets messed with. 

Its going close think going beat Oct July. 

If course still getting correct data. source? im familiar movie. navy find base there? Believe want believe long fits narrative. makes fact? Trump/Putin laugh Since water wet ? cOfFeE HaNd. Exactly. child? children? Schools don‚Äôt lot extra space isolate someone covid symptoms observed (children can‚Äôt left unattended). schools don‚Äôt hool nurse anymore, don‚Äôt spare staff, let alone one paid well enough stay enclosed space possibly covid+ child. live Asia. Masks used people traffic near busy roads. Else, masks used. Masks used pollution.

Just take look Jakarta. There, really nearly 100% people wear mask Jakarta hot spot Indonesia. Post proof, never successful effective/safe vaccine. Fly Europe non Schengen area, overstay visa, join gypsies caravan around mainland Europe.  masks ranging fishnets gas masks. mask talking about. 

although becomes airborne, nothing short n95 suffice. Also change every 8 hrs cumulative deaths, number died average last seven days. They‚Äôre already floating idea. heard family member pitch idea just..Stared. Unbelievable boot likers American society. 

Just unbelievable. experimental artificial gravity lens pressure cooker? don't... China it. Americans voted support him. see rest us suffer mistake. No, still stop point. little delay going happen like Wuhan, Italy, Spain NY.

Hoping majority americans finally wake government unwilling enforce. Hey hey hey. orange Vanilla Coke Zero shit. used one month treat. Counterpoint: [water Oh, go herd immunity all? I've heard last months swedes denying strategy... credible countries offer nearly free university education. suggest getting get educated, rather. rest world laughing us. USA become punchline. interesting especially know numbers Singapore. There, 300 000 foreign workers concentrated dormitories. 40 000 got tested positive. None died. So, Corona harmless seen numbers.

But wrong areas then? think high fatality rate nothing much Corona factor nobody considering there.

Actually, true many locations around Indian Ocean.  It'll interesting, county around 40 total cases since march so. Could you, please, not? Natural selection work folks. Awwww that‚Äôs sad...you‚Äôre gonna stuck ugly now. Fortnite laaaame mom would also say think people QUITE low-information particular thing, unless actively trying be. 

Sure, Trump something inappropriate, such-and-such senator gets caught lying, Trump gets accused whatever random illegal thing, think lot people pretty low-information. hear second-hand, maybe see headline there, make minds it. They're busy. think silly personally, try form forceful opinions I'm well informed. get it.

But think that's less true coronavirus. virus absolutely omnipresent. news every day. governor press conference every week. walk outside, people wearing masks. favorite restaurant closed. can't go gym. coworker tested positive last week. seen least some, potentially friends/family months. political scandal #68971, out-of-sight climate change, anything like this. face, fucking life. People spent paid attention time virus anything remember life maybe 9/11. Maybe.

My point is, vast majority people, know truth masks (and covid general) now, either full tilt moron willfully want know.  argument two sides valid points. case argument between: protecting people, killing people. act like sides valid points?

Edit: add this, acting like sides argument always equally valid extremely counter-productive many cases usually true. anti-vaxxers, climate-change deniers, creationists etc. 40% peers apparently struggle object permanence. fucking foolish. Like happening? I'm somewhat irked viewpoint Americans wearing mask end Coronavirus sense wearing mask PART strategy, strategy.

The US really needs masks social distancing real lockdowns get control. expect US get control... 
 
In fact, I'd like see mask use shops Netherlands... fear opened much soon. numbers prove wrong now, let's hope stays way. true fucking pandemic. Individuals ok people groups fucking annoying. dont really care study says I'm intelligent social distancing.id rather know people safe One party stupid party, all. Thank you. Honestly, could simply tell around healthcare professional like right precautions take. 


Make sure people around wear masks properly. pointless covering mouth nose. pull mask speak instead speak louder slower, annunciating consonants *if need really be,* pull mask forward chin side mask still person front you, wash hands.


Everyone role play. Every person teach follow precautions consistently prevent tens others contracting virus. People try go urgent care doctor ER we're seeing dozens people daily. disinfect equipment patients, extra documentation required someone tested, emphasize/explain people **must break quarantine** discharging, also call inform every patient results, we'd easily seeing towards 200 patients day. hope patients able manage symptoms obeying quarantine home end seeing sister, RN hospital often working five 12hr shifts week. cap number rapid tests perform day went many tests, left next day. 


What people understand wave hit every place once. New York got slammed beginning much international travel there. Traveling states beginning infection takes time. wave hitting Florida. wave peak quickly New York population dense. However, forsee Florida's peak grossly overshadowing New York's population greater proportion elderly immunocompromised, *we literally anti-mask activists here.* People shocked stupidity forget healthcare workers must deal repercussions stupidity.


**We drowning curve never flattened.**  Education  locked 191 cases day smart know better lock kill surge fast (while still traceable) instead wait till cases 10k+ day rest country getting surges too, making impossible anything much longer shut face mass organ damage mass death. Nice Setting bar US impressive tbh. bet pay get priority. poor people problems! I'd say already huge advantage virus 3-5 days (which IgG generated), probably immune virus good time. Spain's nice, lots English speakers here, lots Americans üòÅ make trilogy? absolutely agree. There‚Äôs hot pets though right iirc. colder colder delve depths sin. Religion crazy huh.

dungeon master? believe big reason current political climate amount people *don't vote* staggering.

Trump 2016 65 Million Votes.. 19.5% US population time. Obviously everyone vote, 18.

So look eligible votes, 129 million voted Clinton/Trump, around 9 Million voting candidates.

However, approximately 250 Million Eligible aged voters. means 100 Million people *could* voted didn't. another Candidate received non-votes, Clinton Trump would utterly crushed election.

Basically could easily wildly different political leadership non-voters started showing up. problem things like mail-in voting discredited would likely make elections going forward greatly different purely convenient vote. So..... World midst serious pandemic, Office President United States (one three branches Federal Government) purposefully preventing data pandemic shared Center Disease Control (the government agency tasked protecting nation disease) - withholding due political reasons? beyond pale.

Anyone voting keep President political party fighting hard hang onto power morals ashamed. People stupid. think experts every thing. Even Oxford University speed phase 3 June. They're hard work provide vaccine ASAP people. people reason got spread much. listen wear mask social distancing. Bold assume people left 2122  Well...duh find it, I'm interested! Trump send us war. don‚Äôt think study needed come conclusion. Evolution happening real time. far 15 20 years?!  Also Earth flat hoax. government taught parents us use glasses control behavior. Every country lying numbers, especially Japan goals hosting Olympic games!!

You know also prevents large droplets transmitting air? Covering damn mouth like normal person cough sneeze like we've years!! gonna cough dirty mask wear around call healthy breathe snot sneeze particles?

Sorry see works. sneeze sneeze shirt. tell worse strategy sneezing mask?

The masks prevent viruses going through, small.

And I've seen people sneeze masks. take mask temporarily sneeze shirt lol. talk like bot though. 50 million people died.

That's fucking insane. rolled eyes hard Sounds like sports trash even capitalism. Cannot pro sports without printing big brrrr bucks. Sciences

Nonsense... would better asking improve situation people rely charity sustenance. anything effecting policy towards goal putting bandaid gaping wound. waste efforts helping people stuck perpetual cycle, focus ending cycle help along future generations?

That rely heavily charity failure society. Secret service would bound Biden if/when comes office January. Trump would deemed major security hazard refused leave would dragged arrested needed. one fucks secret service. best best. Scotland here, lump us UK one please. certainly case comes America. sure thinking their. Really weren‚Äôt exaggerating enough. could make movie public even increased sense stupidity amounts self destruction even would barely scratch surface mental gymnastics I‚Äôve seen since COVID came mines cancelled... really sucks. politically charged research studies often exacerbate this, painting one side idiots.

How politically charged? They‚Äôre looking reasons people don‚Äôt comply measures protect people. don‚Äôt know people don‚Äôt comply measures first place, going change recommendations GET comply. It‚Äôs political call people that‚Äôs they‚Äôre study anyway, should‚Äôt ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô get people stop killing eachother dying themselves, certain people made political Toleration one important norms. Painting side illegitimate often leads anger, blind hatred, extreme polarisation, making difficult get things done.


You can‚Äôt talk mutual toleration one side LITERALLY endangering people‚Äôs lives, weighing pros cons side nuanced, complicated argument, case one side wrong. People refusing social distance *literally* killing people, don‚Äôt see defended legitimate side have.

EDIT: Imagine people arguing trying stop people drunk driving political issue. You‚Äôre encroaching freedom saying can‚Äôt drive drinking. mind they‚Äôll probably fine it, maybe will, statistically good chance harm and/or others it. might cause collision driving come fine people die. Therefore it‚Äôs reasonable ask give bit freedom (not able drive drunk) protect people. act like legitimate side argument, allowed drive drinking potentially harm people, would pretty ridiculous right? lot similarities social distancing/mask wearing. Shocking. Wait wait wait... fuckin balls shrink hi s?! money grubbing cunt, hope hangs scarf According Dante, hell freezing. man knows hell. Half atleast, Trump made crazier that's  relentlessly downvoted saying got Corona control zero public mask use Netherlands. 

We got Corona control great personal, social financial cost now.

If masks could prevent us repeat victory I'd it. Duh frequently forget I'm doing. spend days confused silly stupid ways.


Yet recently feel like fucking doctor obvious shit seems me. It‚Äôs crazy public health policy driven political opinions scientific data. shouldn‚Äôt making decisions based elected asshole *believes heart*. making decisions based *facts*. Outdoor situation may involve many different elements lead different results. example, people likely eat drink party protest. means lot chances remove mask touching mouth hands. Also protesters move around frequently further, may also reduce risk. That's works bud. missing people get get tested. Also, rounding up? know fatality rate is, certainly way less 5%. dude right. Mask deniers claim used wear mask CO2 rotted brains can't remember wear mask now. narrative fits better dumb asshole whole life. Grass green Well shit Looking IFR meaningless virus cause permanent damage. concern kids get wind permanent disability time turn 25. think nothing cowardly putting ""freedom"" lives others. person lives California near beach, tell fears justified.

*Ahem*: ""I wear mask reason wear underwear. Things gotta breathe!"" terrible. Trump habitual, blatant liar may stop listen rationale change. looks simple way Trump lie numbers help ever decreasing chance get re-elected.

Hopefully hospitals refuse send duplicate copy CDC. People dying time blindly following corrupt government instructions over. far black, Plaid, blue/green. !remindme 3 months yet give time Supposedly virus become immune it. However they're recently discovering cause nerve damage, brain dysfunction, strokes people seemingly recovered it, regardless severe disease affected first. many cases people wanting get out? just... amazing badly US handle this. Denmark less hospitalized people week outbreak, US still going fucking HAM. Lol weed agree. Masks work *with* measures. solution themselves. 

Personally see ""masks everything"" people slightly better no-maskers, promote idea *just* wearing mask makes safe. creates false sense security still allow virus spread. 

I'm UK, we've got control without masks (I think regulations Netherlands, public transport) responses always come back death rate. Yes that's terrible, bad start negate *eventual* effective controlling virus. think something like 25% mask usage here. Explain? Slight correction, actually expanded places like Brazil South Africa - despite horrific death count UK - time trials happening, community spread Oxford low getting enough data. trials started Oxford simply particular vaccine developed here. *than work swing shift Vegas. long term effects, won't...

Makes sense honestly. healthy people recover 1-2 weeks I've seen, get extremely ill recover sometime 4-8 weeks(Though often stay hospital recover fully.) could get majority people take care, would drastically reduce rate infection; almost point ridding us virus. problem is, part country taking measures beginning(The first wave), others see huge flare ups took hoax. many places experiencing flare ups, still believe message.

Be sensible people; wear mask protect can't(I.E; Legitimate lung conditions, Karen) protect loved ones. hit hard, we'd 10 steps toward normalcy 8 weeks.

Plus Asian American help either. Considering approved vaccines market, much. side effects remain limited larger trials, problem since disease much worse. Btw studies also shows people wear masks less likely using commom sense, easier manipulate since beleave propaganda bs media throws them.

for last week deaths rising slowly .. next 3 weeks skyrocket. current infections keep rising (there nothing suggest arrest anytime soon), deaths going get even worse that.

expect rest summer mayhem. water seems wet biggest problem people refuse follow guidelines. wish masks mandatory everywhere requirement enforced. seems simple, yet, difficult, depending live. I'm social distancing self quarantining. took voluntary month long furlough work myself. seems propaganda-y. Nah. say Spanish Flu. loss true hero. fact admit faults know absolutely everything means upper percentile US, imo. Number deaths per day tripled Florida 4 weeks (rolling average).

In Texas number deaths per day quadrupled. Arizona, also tripled since mid-June. starting Noice.. I've seen worse listed US drug commercials. legal? hard Google lack skills specific subject judge quality search finds.

Being critical subject requires skill, someone already ask eli5 Jesus christ man really aggressive. kinda like ahah


I absolutely think topic limits academic study. problem studies often, especially ""psycho-political"" studies firstly, many research methods extremely questionable. Employing small sample size subjects studying specific group people. There's often clear confirmation bias towards whatever want hypothesis be. mention, articles written studies take findings wayyy context. Often misleading sometimes even completely false. 

Secondly, believe stifles discussion, rather encourages it. democracy succeed certain norms needs fulfilled. Mutual Toleration one important norms. Painting side illegitimate often leads anger, blind hatred, extreme polarisation, making difficult get things done. apparent ever. politically charged research studies often exacerbate this, painting one side idiots. 

This makes difficult get things done, especially country America. ends endless mudslinging winner end notjing gets done. important issues end talked about.

I'm foreigner looking in, can't really absolutely sure happening America, certainly looks like it. Natural selection finest. Proof BLM supporters gathered protests stupid 13 million people infrected

Quiting means loss benefits also teachers every state annual contracts. much time one resign contract without penalty.

It's teachers, even though employed summer, collect unemployment summer working getting paid summer days work. becasue ended one contract another begin, promise job. Right?

It's myth teachers get paid summers off. Teachers getting paid summer actually back pay time already worked contracts. money owed work already performed. Somehow spreading pay 12 months instead paying 10 months financial, business, tax reasons anything. past school districts allowed teachers (annual contracted employees) choose wanted pay 10 months 12.

Every contract state ever worked number days required work, pay based number days thus broken daily, hourly rate pay. get paid days contracted work. work prep, training, non contracted work time, summer, vacations, weekends, work get paid for. choice teachers make work times, meet strict deadlines, testing requirements, often teachers really choice put extra contract time hours.

July 14, 2020 5:21 pm¬†by¬†Ian Mount¬†in Madrid

Spain‚Äôs struggle second wave coronavirus infections intensified Tuesday government north-eastern region Catalonia announced strict restrictions movement two areas expanding outbreaks, largest country.

The Generalitat ‚Äî Catalan regional government ‚Äî decreed Segri√†, agricultural region 200,000 people includes provincial capital Lleida, restaurants would able offer takeout delivery services, meetings 10 people would prohibited. Travel towns allowed work, deliveries, essential reasons.

Several neighbourhoods L‚ÄôHospitalet de Llobregat, city population 260,000 borders Barcelona, also face increased restrictions. 300 active cases L‚ÄôHospitalet, mayor N√∫ria Mar√≠n said Monday.

‚ÄúThe virus still here, still present among us, necessary measures must taken numbers indicate it,‚Äù said Meritxell Bud√≥, Generalitat‚Äôs minister presidency.

Spain one countries hardest-hit pandemic, 28,400 people dying testing positive coronavirus. Catalonia second-most affected region, Madrid, facing highest number new infections.

The Generalitat reported 745 new Covid-19 infections Tuesday ‚Äî including 151 Segri√† ‚Äî reporting total 1,100 previous two days. Health minister Salvador Illa said 63 per cent 1,700 people infected Segri√† asymptomatic.

The outbreak began among temporary agricultural workers young people reached level community transmission made impossible control traditional measures.

‚ÄúOnce lot community transmission, don‚Äôt capacity trace cases contacts, thing close stores confine people,‚Äù said Fernando Rodr√≠guez Artalejo, expert epidemiology Autonomous University Madrid.
-

The Generalitat‚Äôs new restrictions come day judge Lleida said right decree home confinement belonged the¬†federal government¬†and measures Generalitat proposing ‚Äúindiscriminate well disproportionate‚Äù.

The latest decree aims put Generalitat‚Äôs plans stronger judicial footing presented court authorisation. Generalitat took pains say new measure impose home confinement Segri√†‚Äôs residents could leave houses work, exercise, medical visits, food shopping necessities.

‚ÄúWe asking residents go unless strictly necessary,‚Äù said Ms Bud√≥, Generalitat‚Äôs spokeswoman.

Mr Illa said Tuesday new decree ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt appear encroach powers state‚Äù, height pandemic instituted world‚Äôs strictest home confinement rules declaring state alert, gives government exceptional powers limit movement. Plenty fellow nurses got hero furloughs hero short-staffed. One friend mine stroke/trauma unit patient ratio 1:7. all..... Yes lockdown =( numbers I‚Äôve seen indicate death rate understated, world wide 2.5x official count. scary thing 1984 100% technology required.

Thought screens, could TVs cameras, make size coin.

Advanced torture techniques, CIA managed early 2000s war terror.

Cameras everywhere, laughably easy, we're almost halfway there, hell one 1984 put automated facial recognition them.

Same thought screens, automated voice transliteration around years(Alexa, Siri, cortana), filter certain words like devices name(bomb, president, gun etc) send result human operative.

It even worldwide, personal theory **only** UK, everyone sent front murdered sent invade France something. Everyone told Winston different untrustworthy source. person told eastasia's version INGSOC, obliteration self, actively trying get arrested. Given Winston's entire job altering history party unrealistic happened point.

When Orwell wrote 1984 40s 50s idea thought screen true mass surveillance science fiction, entirely doable. government admittedly done poor job securing masks, heard reports getting ready produce 5 million masks week. 

But important thing people start wearing masks see slight discomfort worth protects society economy. 

I British, live Korea become mask evangelist really work. able source masks family sent filters. still tell adoption low seems much pushback online especially fellow Christians hence post. Naw, they're conducting study many Redditors break arms patting back. obvious study ever conducted. Can't skip Russian dough nightmares going public forgetting wear mask I've intellectually superior people 60+ years. I'm social. think sub could get self-congratulatory, well done geniuses! :) best con one done right front accept becomes feels normal... surely someone lying something illegal right front you, right? Except that's exactly working. glad idiots reading first awakening. PSA dumbfucks. Yeah, seems part see lot people ignoring. children essentially social distancing since March. Sure, lot played friends gone stores, aren‚Äôt allowed places would spread easiest (bars clubs). hope current belief children less affected holds true‚Äîthough I‚Äôm worried long-term affects given recent reports‚Äîbut doubt probably spreads easily among children among adults. recently two friends high school used spit gum other‚Äôs mouths, distance. shit Sorry. clear instead injecting prejudices. JT often lacks ability make decision fear upsetting someone. ends waffling fence sitting decision made him.

Look XL pipeline. sided builders would good industry economy first Nations environmentalists would upset vice versa. do? dragged heels pipeline execs walked away. decision made taxpayers got saddled cost.

So yes, words spineless equate past track record failing make decisions fear someone upset choice. Please point said that. many videos early days China Italy Spain showing people collapsing street jealous others smarter feel like empty shelves april going look like nothing compared winter Masks slow eradicate SARS. 

learn eradicate \*Obama twice); Voting least do, good, low effort start. Glad thinking world. N side note: Amazon Fresh Diet Coke products. Smiths Vegas (Kroger) Diet Coke bottles... mini cans... reliable metric testing *the share COVID-19 tests returning positive result* (i.e. positive rate) rather testing per population. rationale tests coming positive (i.e. positive rate higher) enough tests pick cases. lower positive rate, sufficiently testing.

Meanwhile, testing per population account number cases actual scale outbreak country. Take example, Taiwan lauded success COVID-19 451 cases far. Taiwan rather low cumulative testing per population 3.27 per 1,000 people. even lower Malaysia (26.28) Singapore (79.83). mean *that's low amount testing Taiwan*? instead look cumulative positive rate, see Taiwan remarkably low positive rate 0.6% meaning every 1000 tests done, 6 come positive. Thus, positive rate better shows country's sufficiency COVID-19 testing opposed testing per population.

With mind, let's look cumulative positive rate Malaysia Singapore. rate currently stands **1.0% Malaysia** **9.6% Singapore**. would indicate Malaysia testing sufficiently Singapore. fact, Malaysia's positive rate comparable South Korea's also 1.0%.

Let's also look daily positive rate would better see recent developments opposed cumulative positive rate. rolling 7-day average positive rate **0.1% Malaysia** **2.3% Singapore**. Again, believe shows Malaysia testing sufficiently Singapore point.

TL;DR: Testing per population (alone) shite indicator sufficient testing. Better look positive rate lah.

* data obtained [Our World reading testing data available website well. say anything numerous BLM protests? Finland one protest got broken cops ridiculed media. read article obvious reasons. US government printing money without regard consequences years now. US dolar backed investors think worth, point people start losing faith. point becoming closer closer.  ice wet! CDC U.K. health people said absolutely evidence period people getting virus twice exact strain!

They also say clear evidence opposite. know. I‚Äôm also wondering long there. We‚Äôre high 90‚Äôs 100‚Äôs degree weather past weekend/this week, I‚Äôm happy get low ‚Äúfuuuuuu it‚Äôs still waaaaarm‚Äù degrees home AC cranked. cold sun-baked van unless he‚Äôd body heat long while?  things hit here:

First, veganism CHOICE. born autism. 

Second, still lot negative stereotypes around people spectrum little representation media almost always inaccurate shows people severe autism. 

People open spectrum sharing experience great thing absolutely continue. raises awareness makes easier people seek diagnosis sooner receive interventions therapies need thrive society. There's chance could vaccine rolling November, though certainly sufficient numbers cover everyone.

Which makes current situation even tragic. We're wave 1.5 people bothered wear mask, they'll kill another 50k 100k people. worn masks, spike vaccine all. 

We've seen masks reduce transmission enough take R0 1. That's solution it; we've found solution we've looking (a pretty obvious one, honestly). want take it? No, want fuck everyone over! They'll probably refuse vaccines too. wish could make anti-maskers last people receive vaccines; ones getting infected reap they've sown.  pasta equal saviour result study water wet: (its rick roll swear) Also BLM anti-Mask protesters can't pull everyone's license sick out, think.

And right hearing lot Texas teacher back school talk Texas one states starts students mid August end May. states seem start later go mid June.

Not every state called school fall yet, delayed start far know. Texas districts still trying figure everything really, event hold person class certain student populations districts already offering parents options online. 

But also aware Texas already federal hot water servicing, testing, , identying, denying services students may qualified Special Education programs, DeVos letting federal requirements programs, Texas ""behind"" already, lot sort legally. 

Fortunately Biden platform fully federally fund special education programs, happen always Democrat agenda item... Since remember/was voting age studying become Sped teacher, (B. Clinton) something keep mind come November. 

In meantime, support teachers please keep pressure leaders across nation support continue fund public schools too. maybe they‚Äôre introverts simply comes naturally. Also money spend living country. priors lean heavily toward ""well enough"" 

Are deriving fact common cold coronaviruses clearly lead lasting immunity? they're dangerous carry meatball stomach Slowest tests world, thank capitalism! like our(Korean) population takes bullshit politicians incessantly push change justice, sometimes we‚Äôre easily swayed conspiracy theories unscientific nonsense. 

I love national solidarity cases tragedy crises like Pandemic, really racist plain mean outsiders, nationalism sometimes bit much. 

It‚Äôs always double-edged sword. That‚Äôs frah-kuhn-schteen 130! Wow! That‚Äôs bigliest! federal moratorium mortgage interest payments affected COVID (landlords included) would‚Äôve solved lot problems, apparent bailouts one-way street comes banks US. Maruchan tastes like cardboard. Maggie alot better r/politics   knew divide smart vs dumb /s guess vaccine effective previously common coronavirus well. 

I also think problematic trying prevent cold. guess we'll get boosters every 4 6 months. one would develop common cold vaccine price burden, COVID changes everything. may running doctor 2 3 times year stay immune. I'd fucking heartbeat COVID. *pats head* good girl! always knew intelligent Ebay Carter foundations guinea worm project well known corner world. Legend. It‚Äôs intelligence it‚Äôs values. People social distance care public safety people don‚Äôt assholes lmao sneak there, caravan up. big border real death count likely good deal higher 130k, since we're allowing speculative figures. *closes book* ha, like thats ever gonna happen must Trump ran businesses went bankrupt ""People social distance may intelligent, study says"" posted /r/coronavirus.

Pandering. basically...expect 4-8 \*months Confirmation bias overpowered society.

I blame like Elon Musk use ""genius"" reputation propaganda without ethical boundaries.  problem disease quite virulent, people stupid may die. may live spread people eventually die instead. Well, much needed launch study this? need UN level intervention insane is. cohorts responsible hundreds thousands deaths trying hide mess. biggest ""cover-up"" history country, done plain sight. Name checks out... Even better announce guaranteed symptom covid penis shrinking. mid-late 20‚Äôs friend group, would say that‚Äôs absolutely case (I‚Äôve staying home). **TOO SOON.** I've depressed country while. shut schools non-essentials down. People could work home did. Instances crowd funding donations keep people fed roof head. even half-assed attempt stimulus package unemployment roll-out. way later have, universal around country, enforce masks social distancing degree even mildly sane person would. take step. toddlers step taken 13 year old. 
 
I modicum hope minute. 
 
2 months later (even less many places), many people say ""fuck it"". 
 
People wear masks even places required. Almost one enforces mask mandates. true even, maybe even true, police government. People gather crowds beaches. Bars restaurants packed. Schools reopening fuck plan. People literally protesting publishing hissyfit videos putting piece cloth faces totally reasonable amount time. 
 
People screaming ""My rights! constitution!"" without understanding former ever reading latter. 
 
People thinking money economy better important Jane preexisting condition Bob lung damage working asbestos covered shipyard time Navy. 
 
People saying ""natural selection"" despite really knowing works well enough explain it. 
 
The old myth ostriches burying head ground changed Americans. Except myth. 
 
Hell, individual states make ""Top 5 number corona infections"" lists entire countries. 
 
I gave false hope. Americans inherently optimistic despite reason be. assuming souls mass. means, wear mask. hate ""I smart"" pissing contest.  live alone. period approx 80 days 15th March meet single human being. Except bimonthly visit supermarket. 
Which also reduced twice month reduce outings. Ended lugging lot groceries trips. 

It good mental health saw way. know many colleagues Nantes went even severe lockdown. colleges huge spread virus. UC Berkeley outbreak last week off-campus Greek houses, students gone home. return university live dorms shared apartments there's 50-50 chance get infected. 99% 20-somethings asymptomatic cold/flu-like symptoms. 1% that's unlucky could hit pneumonia &amp; mono-like lethargy months end. there's possibility residual effects like brain fog symptoms mimic chronic fatigue syndrome. consider risks carefully making decision. mention aging population.. great advantage discipline Japanese people wear masks. Well, yeah, we've social distancing since we'll COVID.  sorry, that‚Äôs awful. kind cardiac specific issues having? assuming speak Spanish then? ""says there's increasing evidence helps prevent spread COVID-19""

Yeah. evidence called Europe Asia.  He'll get accolades honors heaped him. denounce pandemic, fake numbers tell people easing opening economy fine! Specifically lowest part Satan flaps wings creates freezing wind. Sooner later Trump going catch Corona, think might take out.  good girl... dog collar leash, down? Daily cases US orders magnitude higher Europe.

Also, given many adults refuse wear mask social distance, well really expect children fare? 40% country thinks coronavirus hoax. lot hydroxychloroquine‚Äôs adverse effects come prolongation QT interval, especially combination azithromycin. arrhythmia problem structural (left right ventricular abnormalities) abnormalities identified echo study. 

Nevertheless it‚Äôs scary hell dread going work every morning! Cheers pandemic doc! No, don‚Äôt think will. Fuck health. true, it‚Äôs also reason US leases pharmaceutical innovation. *Sigh* Well DUH! it‚Äôs state mandated city company mandates employees customers. managers offer mask customer says ‚Äúno.‚Äù Well can‚Äôt force we‚Äôre allowed throw out. It‚Äôs bs. people usually want can't have? quite jarring possibilities taken away knowing come back, even normally use them. can't believe bot r/theonion well designed peer review study comes out, really dont know immunity look like.

What **do** know however US UK, high number doctors nurses already died virus, spite outside most-at-risk age range least healthy enough work. indicates multiple exposure high load virus particles leads higher infection illness rates. turn square logically people get infected, get infected slightly, develop robust immunity that. clearly important things missing picture. 

Three things possible:

1. Perhaps, high virus load likely overwhelm immune system. true, virus would behave bit different viruses. reason infection normally dominates virus load internal replication virus body cells. think normally, number virus particles affects *probability* infection, severity. way strength damage house fire relatively independent whether caused single match multiple matches.
2. Possibly, immunity mild infection strong lasting, effect infections happen relatively often, less mild dangerous.
3. Possibly, virus weakens immune system infection future virus attacks become damaging. One doctors Wuhan died warned exactly that. would bit like arsonist frequently throws matches onto flammable material, also destroys fire alarms sprinkler systems effect attacks cause damage.

I agree point many ways, know yet, good indication. like coronavirus magically disappeared youre smart, aint rich? It‚Äôs like flu... Me, stuffing face whole watermelon: uh, what? It‚Äôs calorie-dense? really want go scientific rabbit hole look arguments masked doctor sneeze. merit theory look directly open wounds increase safety.   Go /r/covid want source based discussion. sub news-based entertainment. memba plutocrats told us Bernie crazy? Yes. exactly, literally, everyone saying. Water isn‚Äôt wet gets things wet, it‚Äôs water Immunity isn‚Äôt determined antibodies, looked 9 people study, half DIDN‚ÄôT show decreased antibodies. Hardly conclusive. look lens ""what best way destroy America"" instant pot, radioactive element several smoke detectors, dismantled deluxe laser pointer... trick?  Totally. There's many things love Korea living also frustrating things. One favorite things Koreans helped pay back IMF. government asked send personal gold help pay debt. crazy thing totally it! Everyone motivated make shit happen totally worked! asked Americans that, there's way would answer call! Koreans super powers teamwork. Like every stat +5 working team.

But there's cost individuality independence cases. awkward sometimes humiliating experience working idiot boss needing says, abusive parent need listen to. old students, younger, older would give 500 say, go buy bread, older. frustrating, expected. course, nation pure snow either. definitely problems sure, fascinating see culture exist outside really makes think things learned lot it. problem scenario widespread outbreaks BLM protests. Epidemiologists draw distinction outdoor protests majority people wear face masks people congregating indoors without face masks. 1918. last year WWI

It last year WW-I ***because*** spanish flu. german army new people conscript fit enough front line infantry. surrender. contract Covid, getting placebo may best thing happens you. There's good reason new drugs tested approved hitting market. headline make redditors feel good themselves. Jerk away, boys! Based flight data that‚Äôs true. could see people going miami another parts state tx beaches Dallas something likely cause.

I contacted area union rep. basically told, yes, district violating law, rights, due location (public land/school 98% reservation students) would get away it. Union anything.

When got point, began panic attacks work, becasue addition break work day, family support around lost family member, (and really one assistants leave work permantly son stabbed, nearly died, would near coma state rest life), noticeable panic attacks, one campus mid management team, finally decided told another teacher department would cover class could finally take lunch.

Perhaps need political parties focused seeking public office. build power like Panthers building communities resilient accomplish dual-power vulnerable communities. ""Yeah CDC told us wear mask beginning, refuse change beliefs convenient ignore new information contradicts personal opinions."" ever many? Wonder compares Oxford vaccine's success immunity. Oxford one seems along though, especially still makes used UK public October. Sane people everywhere: ""US could **had** corona control 4-8 weeks ago fucking retarded, evidenced entire rest world"".  BS statement would take mask part everyone forced stay home also places could work food shops, utilities, shipment only. like hardcore online shopping, can't go inside store. USA government past point return everyone fucked They're game show hosts. reality involved Trump Hell...we barely recovered 2008 2016, big. naturally won‚Äôt Good send fuck back border.

Wishful thinking current Congress. They've fighting second stimulus couple months. Even goes through, got hope get vetoed.

Even stimulus, brother unemployment, still pay bills. done hand essentially fake, printed money Super rich calling higher taxes wealthy, lower taxes super rich. promising!

Weird, thought opposite - holy moley that's lot side effects! label use prohibited. approved human use approved human use, mean insurance cover non indicated uses still used often especially nothing better published. tricky part comes actually try study show benefit anecdotal. not. dont know sector all. story late day pump dump. never hear anything more.

I've seen promising studies leaked refutes fact information released. Moderna never even made vaccine. 

This joke

It's recycled garbage may 18th. already. Officials worried shortages hospitals doctors everyone tried get masks beginning pandemic. Naw. ‚ÄòMerica freedom that. working out? science told us spring pass test could move on. Unfortunately bunch dumb asses wanted ‚Äúfree‚Äù work failed science test attend Covid summer school selfish jerks. Hey, Trump wore mask TV finally 4 months. Can‚Äôt teach stupid. ü§î answer quite simple, young people initially increasing infection group least likely die. see flattening deaths, likely many young people infected total deaths offsetting lower IFR. Also, older people infected now, would reasonably expect appreciable gains deaths one month (unlikely match March still higher). Completely irrelevant. problem source infection. It‚Äôs poor response fact infection. Otherwise, vast horde infected northerners would also presumably spawning uncontrolled outbreaks home states, one would assume implying initially got infected. addition, northern New England hell lot Texas, Florida, etc plates.  
The suggestion seems somehow limiting travel would help. Seems unlikely point, it‚Äôs spread among local residents everywhere. Talk/blame cheap‚Äîhow leadership? already out. highest dose got can‚Äôt adhoc trades CEO. planned announced advance. Every time get highway something happen. still get highway, like get places fast. safer using side roads time that?  Saw video drive testing site handing individuals nasal swabs self test.


Oh boy. way accurate. boycott going back schools government learns stop fucking around health. actual fuck comment broken American system collapsed stress tested Cuz wasn‚Äôt released White House Also, [NIH seem level. Praying bestüôèüèΩ good idea wear masks, sure, seriously doubt control 8 months, let alone 8 weeks... without masks. Uh huh, like 2 weeks. still need buy stuff!!! health issue. can't wear mask. told 10 - 15 times day. give free masks door.

I multiple people every day say ""a health issue."" emotionally draining trying help fellow Americans. first things popped up. issue wrong. seems, sides, NOBODY EVER wrong. Ffs hard say ""I wrong this, let's try this."" fault, try listen sides it, neither honest. whole thing would go lot smoother everyone would honest.. mean social creatures I'm Ontario agree you, quarantine 14 days come Manitoba. makes sense controlling spread. defense. really testing labs report negatives.

However really small made small percentage 1000 tests even turned negatives in, would little effect positive percent.. 

It small labs making dumb mistakes seems Infections increased testing?? 

New solution: eliminate reports! 

That way still test, idea there's flare ups. 

It's like taking school test getting 60/100 whole class graded curve... one collecting grades never really know curve die. 

Tldr people die know outbreaks affect US citizen already wear mask public... so... cheers! clear competent direction leadership would achievable much earlier. Chill don‚Äôt know Cuomo corona golden boy? what‚Äôs everyone nursing home grannie dead, spoke nicely press conferences! overestimate logical thinking capabilities I'm sure really know whats tho ya? utterly useless article. point.

Well then, I'm sorry. Hol up. Wait. mean people go places *if let go there*? sort closure restrictions passes. masks come come cases, shut back down. Rinse. Repeat. http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1981  People gonna people. 

Wear masks, wash hands, breath me. Get life. Keep away indoor entertainment. Less people would die virus... complicated. people give shit decide wear mask, less dead Americans going be. mah freedumb! thing is, *almost* did. I'd bet money there's plenty monsters like who've done never caught. COVID mortality rates people ages 10-19 0.00032%

 *Help us Tony Fauci -- hope!* expecting giant trash pile collapse. guess, hindsight, 2016 election.  feel trapped Georgia. Held hostage morons. Trump gotten board started selling MAGA-masks jump street, he'd funded whole campaign saved tens thousands lives. idiotic piece garbage. Quit! worth life! like we‚Äôd flatten curve quarantined 15 days? WEAR FUCKING MASKS ASSHOLES ! Hoping go 2-0 tourney far!

Some people far gone there's saving them. 

These people likely get and/or around killed, nobody charge gives flying fuck.  realize asian countries continued business usual didnt lockdown shit control, right? Would interested know think possible treatment. also wondering likely studies translate actual results humans.  Probably snowbird going home summer. Also, Fauci us respectful spilling beans likely forced communicate everything he‚Äôs condemned saying current administration. least that‚Äôs theory. Like, I'm kinda comfortable idea writer BttF 2 could sue copyright infringement point... got ptsd hospital ER tying pumping ketamine repeatedly ran chest tubes. already stressful situation (in another country vacation), losing control mind thought process took whole level, convinced died afterlife, I'd start come they'd blast back off, control it, expect it, really, really bad. Unions illegal teachers several states. sure Texas one.

In situation, fuck law... also, fuck system allowed bans teachers' unions first place data published NEJM, promising, early. ‚ÄúThe findings likely increase hopes vaccine brought market quickly. However, number patients trial experienced side effects, severe.‚Äù Speak yourself. I‚Äôm still laughing Everyone US would jobs 4-8 weeks employed want wear mask. messes spray tan. Mississippi here:
The governor spent large amount time trying dispel great many rumors. said can't herd immunity absolutely destroy health system. 

Yet, refuses require mask statewide. also refuses close business (hairdressers bars). Plus parents let kids go party. 

Don't care 18 years old, go party quarantine garden shed three weeks. anecdote consistent point: fear positive result, whatever reason, avoid testing honest contact tracers. 

So can't take stories happened Springfield face value many inclined avoid testing. write letter make donation waiver believe. Speak Tired Paywalls here. even post sign pay read article. pay enough internet already. what? saying stupid things? much I'd like blame them, no. politicos. blame. Deaths reported lag deaths actually happening, 7 days. 

It's possible refrigerated trucks actually *are* needed today... man‚Äôs head enormous! It‚Äôs freaking month schools open US current situation US look mild comparison. Honestly... feel deserves it, go ahead dude. sure shit ain't stopping you.

(But seriously though, hell wrong people?) Soooo need refrigerator trucks, deaths aren‚Äôt going much.. think harped China little early sure anything worse. it‚Äôs right par Every time see thing ""if everyone wears masks x positive thing happen"" think myself, ""So saying we're screwed then."" Lol many people, mean like soooo many people, absolutely refuse listen reason wearing masks. wearing mask become something akin Satan something. craziest thing witness, toddler tantrum something harmless helpful. Yeah. People think critical thinking panacea eradicate people bad views, truth people going changed logic. problem largely one group vs group mentality, attempt stop antivaxxers contend fact rational people believe irrational things get higher status within social group, makes feel superior ""sheep"" DIDN‚ÄôT ""new information"" ""We lying, started telling truth finally"".

It's like suddenly realize face masks protect respiratory infections, always knew that. government originally wanted general public wear masks would doctors nurses, lied pretended masks work. article made attempt quantify scope issue impact overall numbers. uses words like ""shocking"" so.

It minimum incredibly sloppy reporting. given source's history propoganda network I'm going view intentional.

It interesting thing consider. 

By article, convicted crime. enough revoke entry next time Canadian comes border? *Most severe far! inverse true NYC shit show 3 months ago. ‚ÄòCept Mtn. Dew... got part right. ‚Äúif‚Äù key word Here's goes, Trump loses election new President what's best Country himself.
So good like 8-10 months.

Til then....we get watch fools complain wearing masks get sick hell, maybe die....that gene pool begs get smaller. True expect surge spending traveling public feels safe   started saying work Spanish Flu. saying along work. actually enjoy reading them. can't find better jokes anywhere. Wisconsin ban travelers greater Chicago area well. would require people rational! california right florida texas yet MSM doesnt report it? though ""muh freedoms"" Police protests still happening. media stopped covering it.  Honestly half people know complaining people also part population even bother vote 2016, feel bad. mean yeah, hopefully get help whole civil war thing starts back again. 150 GB??? Jesus Christ, U.S. pay $40-100 month get 8 GB data. right wing nuts town convinced hoax/conspiracy government wants control us. reason adamantly refuse wear masks anywhere. dont care. Trump can't find anybody partisan enough work CDC still fudge numbers. get tested border control quarantine? people posted Directors telling actors bother. Canadians sure, told? Welcome pandemic Best Buy  live US, seen person without mask public place since pandemic began, seen anyone give anyone hard time wearing one. literally lie. think masks would help preventing spread respiratory virus fucking absurd.

They lied didn‚Äôt trust public tell truth: masks help, didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) enough medical grade masks general public. gave ammunition anti-mask idiots. rate florida texas going going take way long take way masks. 

In Michigan seeing uptick seem going poorly initially. people got restaurants noticeable increase. people choose personal safety providing families.

I envy them. one canadian. Sucks everyone crossfire though Weird, Trump said reporter questioned confederate flag free speech. Yet doctor actual facts share okay?

How work again? constitutional fine print, like letters something? sad see many Americans screwed. good memories visiting US 10 years ago. Yesterday talked aunt lives Maryland conversation constantly thinking get back origin country can't due closed border US. live 3rd world country... unbelievable. Hold on, guys. Voting Biden great. I'm sure people beating around bush letting Democrats sound like unspeakable demons aren't. actually take responsibilities govern instead mouthing like indignant Reagans. predicament Republicans would always go ""ALL ILLS WORLD WELFARE QUEENS"" even pandemic. now, hundreds thousands Americans dying, surrounded people vocal embarrassed are. Oh wait, similarly embarrassed back voted in, he'd help get way single issues. knew full well inexperienced, incapable, divisive, could get way. deal knew it. needs experienced candidate would try cut deals sides? like would ever disaster within four eight years great US A! Oh wait, that's sin called pride it? Pure hubris. course, they're always embarrassed long get way. they'll similarly vote come months. Never Democrats. talk #neverDemocrats dream bloodless coup solve everything, must fucking nice detached nitty gritty details effort.

Democrats freaking humans. Flawed, least sort well-meaning dutiful. Anyone enough societal responsibility work politics delusional, selfish, irresponsible, lazy Reagan acolyte probably Democrat. Even got lazy ass awesome, totally democratically supported, bloodless purge, going replace government officials with? Republicans continue fawn Trump embarrassments means get way single issues bit more, responsibilities, pass buck personal responsibilities (you're responsible health! also let's neuter CDC info responsible health!), blame China, say God's will, whatnot? maybe bunch similar-minded, outraged bloggers never governed once? I'm sure fall old mold CHAZ security enforcers did.

Get real take *personal responsibility* instead mouthing peddling disgusting, irresponsible delusions. mullet majestic AF! Except antibodies end immunity people. T-Cells mechanisms create longer lasting immunity. never get strain regular cold virus also coronavirus twice properly functional immune system. "" people separate pandemic ""

 *This* Trump know Ontario is. 

I definitely believe cognitive test 'amazed' doctors. isnt coronavirus article. belongs bitcoin subreddit like rest trash post. I‚Äôm still disbelief daycares open montco PA. Strapped down?! muh freedumb! swear Aspies new vegans.  relentlessly downvoted saying got Corona control zero public mask use Netherlands. that's people generally face mask, got control whole public face masks became thing. (Remember told mask use benefit general public first.) 

Only since June 1st masks obligatory public transportation. 6 feet distance observed also trains buses. country shut hard March. trains service even cut back virtually no-one travelled. traffic streets too. People quite rigourous social distancing too. 
 
It seems like author piece wants sensationalize things bit least. good reasons varying policies. ....KEL LOVES ORANGE SODA!!!  explains American numbers.  Damn times much simple game thrones good.... Fair enough Can't fix stupid, can't stop people gambling lives. thing that's missing Florida Governor saying ""sacrifice grandma economy,"" yet reach Texas levels stupidity.

Sadly, believe elderly dying COVID-19 Republican's solution fixing social security medicare $$ funding Gaps. birthday coming soon people keep asking I'm going celebrate. answer literally thing every day: Hang home family try around anyone else.  fact boil sins... again, maybe boiled vacuum. Worse, we'll live anti-maskers realize they're keeping pandemics alive Canadian hospital worker, here.

I‚Äôm supposed get $4/hr ‚Äúpandemic pay‚Äù every hour worked Apr 24 ‚Äî Aug 13. 

Haven‚Äôt seen yet, expecting $4k.

I heard rumours physicians working got $40k each. instead get populist leaders presidents anything except right thing, sometimes wonder. world getting better worse level shit happening every century? Sometimes shudder think era Vlad impaler might way knowing people getting impaled today concentration camps. called populist leaders care votes DEMOCRATIC country CoVid-19 apparently. vaccines making people make anti-bodies people actual disease question make survive. Yep. N95 respirator, example. methodologies ween away that. seems like foothold, can't break away without severe repercussions. like covid equivalent anti smoking campaigns person hole neck. wrong people party??? care dropped dead. think somehow level sympathy empathy spawn? get wrong, wish done it, gives morons already deny pandemic excuses stupidity ignorance. 

But reasons, clear still support yes, lie yes likely create distrust, that's respect openly admitting it. first point, mean, yeah right. there's shortages u selling countries fault. add point,there numerous reports government actively confiscating ppe supply brought country honestly issue government itself.  is, even conflicting information. article says dont know long waiting, waiting 45 minutes, quotes mayor (this happened town still real info) saying day, lines hours long. true, recently set volunteer covid testing center town inundated. Cases hospitalizations spiked past weeks.

In another article mentioned man may getting tested prior procedure.

So basically idea details are. I'm sure we'll know soon. still alarming someone dies waiting line anything, much less Covid test. article claim died Covid. Trump fixed it. hospital Covid data skip CDC go straight administration getting reported. 

Wish kidding. Absolutely fascinating read. Thank you. debt continues go up, always record. feels like constant adding ""record"" headlines purely sensational point, almost desensitises us noteworthy record-breaking events Everything I‚Äôve read says it‚Äôs different flu shot different virus

That's different vaccine, one OP completely novel mRNA vaccine. **N95** mask **N95 respirator** particulate-filtering facepiece **respirator** meets U.S. National Institute Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) **N95** classification air filtration, meaning filters least 95% airborne particles. N95 part filtering system part able switch. 


While already exists people working hazardous environments: Probably not. risk false negative day prior symptoms onset 40% 60%. Tests often unreliable symptoms onset virus chance multiply enough reach upper airway. better reliability, get tested 3 days symptoms onset, risk false negative drop 20%. Even then, test tell infected, never tell healthy.

""Over 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" symptoms timeline: Well sure, people don‚Äôt stupid. intelligent stupid people exactly high praise.  fear retaliation US fear China trying muscle influence, kinda middle here. say toothless. understand nonsense myself. **Literally** vaccines, immune response like exactly hell look for.

Polio. Measles. Rubella. Etc.

All immune response like says ""You immune disease fight easily get sick point even spread disease!""

There‚Äôs also long term health effects getting covid. 

I don‚Äôt think rely herd immunity (that isn‚Äôt brought vaccine) without learning more. Herd immunity without vaccine gamble unknown point.

We right numbers. many die. 

I want cry. really do.

I guess ""half testing means half cases"" logic Trump find different way play numbers. say average intelligence levels comparing different countries??

There understandably HUGE levels mass hysteria regarding COVID. really 'piles' anecdotal evidence science would backing PR move. don‚Äôt need pandemic that.. you‚Äôre still confused means you‚Äôve never really looked it. horse beaten death past 6 months LITTLE, LATE!

Going high score!  Trump interpret personal attack reply tariffs jealous! visit decided move ? proud ex-Floridian, would travel part, comrade. soo think rather get now, wait understand virus better possibly know treat properly prevent lessen possible long term damage?

let's put way, important test pass graduate, subject complicated really understand yet, choose take it, say ""now"" get since can't postpone forever, do. say take. couple weeks / months give time prepare test? try close down, countries severely reduced infection rates deaths. countries halfway, hardly call hoax first act late screw everyone making whole thing even worse infections wise economy wise. shout economies completely kill instead trying protect it. Yes close holds economie, also protects worse. Something overlooked shortsighted ones. Neither WA see us reopening wantonly  seen one positive Trump comment, ever, Reddit feed. Why?? 4-8 weeks? That's like ten freedom years. Spanish flu first wave mild symptoms days. Reported cases Spanish flu dropped summer 1918, hope beginning August virus run course. retrospect, calm storm. Somewhere Europe, mutated strain Spanish flu virus emerged power kill perfectly healthy young man woman within 24 hours showing first signs infection.

The virus ended infecting 500 million people worldwide killed estimated 20 million 50 million victims. Plus many (young) children can't notice mild symptoms like adults do. tell sore throat, headache, loss smell etc, often even parent notice it. Yea, republicans pass aid package. Dont forget English! We're dumb too! Honestly am, see almost everyone wear masks. +60% people don‚Äôt cover nose given orders: wants keep job, toes line. Anybody job gets make choice now. Hey give credit. that.

They leaked opposition research nation's top pandemics expert. told supporters masks useful. suggested states follow examples Florida Texas. tried fuck legal immigrants student visas. 

They lots stuff, none helpful. Glad hear things Illinois better. I'm Texas 70% like absolute floor support rural counties. home county 80% significant black population. ones many minorities around 90%. presidents approval rating amongst party consistently 90% usually around 95. Even this. mean means saying I'm trying get COVID I'm taking virus seriously. However, event vaccine, like poster replying mentioned, find eventuality ""getting back life regardless"" lot easier stomach I'm thinking rather ""at-risk"" (so speak) people know. since I'm thinking myself, hard time agreeing people think throw caution wind bite bullet. matters Americans immediate conveniences vehement disdain inconveniences.. long don‚Äôt delicate nasal passages offended slight discomfort about, wearing mask like proper countries spanked CoViD-19 did.

Let‚Äôs talk ‚Äúlong-term damage.‚Äù

Given CoViD-19 unlike anything else before, amount lingering issues causes per 1 death mind-boggling:

‚Äî 19 hospitalizations

‚Äî 18 /w permanent heart damage

‚Äî 10 /w permanent lung damage

‚Äî 3 given strokes

‚Äî 2 neurological issues affect memory.

‚Äî 2 neurological issues affect eternal fatigue.


The best part blind public really is. either think they‚Äôre invulnerable dying ‚Äî they‚Äôll survive like majority 99%. define ‚Äúsurvival?‚Äù

What don‚Äôt consider, 23-yo swimming champion went Covid19 party month ago, got cool buddies ‚Äúget way.‚Äù

But now, permanent lung damage, hindering ability compete swimming. Who‚Äôs going pay additional healthcare may need rest life? longer focus studies he‚Äôs obtained memory issues? gets random blood clot leg needs amputated? 

The amount dangerous effects lingering issues related ailment scary. curve this.

Imagine 3 million dead. Really drop bucket versus 360 million. add another 150-200 million serious health complications result covid19? hospital system would undeniably overwhelmed; especially country like US without universal healthcare.

Imagine fatigued barely get bed? Much less work health insurance pay lingering side effects brought ailment.

Tell me, people contracting CoViD19 multiple times, many times body beat off, time sustaining permanent damage various parts system? Like phone‚Äôs battery life. 81%, 68%, 58%, etc. Eventually, body withered complications can‚Äôt even handle day-to-day tasks afterthought 2018. 

You survive end holes lungs, survive end fatigue gross struggle get half days. get couple months later. well fight off? that‚Äôs say don‚Äôt get anything else exhausted body can‚Äôt handle, also making susceptible ailments normally wouldn‚Äôt worry about.

This herd immunity bullshit it‚Äôs downright arrogant foolhardy think proper way beat get assume you‚Äôll fine afterwards ‚Äî still don‚Äôt know much this. 

Absolutely mind-boggling US mentality surrounding this. HIV antivirals first symptom onset. mask compliance. telling study finds out? I'm American living saigon. Maybe know lot Vietnam, interesting you, let explain see here. pandemic, normal day, see 20% people public places wearing masks. culturally accepted commonly used. Vietnam think people mistakenly believe masks protect wearer actually do. Back late January, 16 cases entirety Vietnam, went bank (which generally pretty crowded) everyone wearing mask. 100%. Generally ask remove mask entering bank, banks letting people masks. mask laws. Slowly government made masks mandatory bus stops, grocery stores, pretty much public spaces. send message people serious, really mechanism enforcement. Generally government ""makes example"" individuals puts TV warning everyone else, day day one enforcing laws. Everyone (and Japan/Korea/Hong kong hear) crediting universal masking (and contact tracing) reason virus never spread, meanwhile US CDC recommending people wear masks... pretty mind blowing. idea CDC took long recommend masking. act like new information came changed policies, that's ridiculous. We've known since kindergarten cover mouth cough, mask logical extension that, even uneducated Vietnamese comprehend. stop virus, literally 1) wear mask public 2) wash hands 3) stay home sick. 2/3 everyone anyway without pandemic. Center Disease Control destroyed. want control diseases. awake sleeping 1.5 hours forget say ""again""? yeah, were. 

Some went home patiently best, couple sat like drooling idiots Trump suggested injecting bleach. told like useless, dancing monkeys. Well lead decline reported cases, &amp; time kids go back school. never happened This. so, so, new even well-trained virus specialist world admit pretty much pissing wind lot 'facts' moment.

If virus, recovered, levels caution would remain (at least german) kind autobiographic books psychologist describe experiences. Sophie Seeberg one (a family psychologist) describes woman convinced genius skipped two grades school - turned set back twice, dumb actually realize it. many people still infected becoming likely last much longer, possible potential vaccine worked right wouldn‚Äôt even work coronavirus mutates time vaccine ready?

EDIT: link helped find I'm trying learn mask types effectiveness. Right now, I'm using surgical masks, two air filter cut sealed mouth, I'm sure effective even is. want protect protect others. want using flimsy masks 20% efficacy. 

Where get K95 masks? Could point direction, please? Thank much advice! LA mayor recently conceded protests may caused spike cases. something. problem people keep thinking there's binary outcome getting COVID-19...you either recover die. many parents feel safe sending kids back school. see low death rate children think big deal kid catches it. narrative needs change. remember reading studies back early March China permanent lung damage virus. know taken long information get widely publicized. We're seeing post-infectious cases hyper-inflammatory toxic shock, Kawasaki disease, acute myocardial injuries way higher rates normal kids infected COVID.  I'm sorry hard time.

If need help, feel alone, feeling stuck current circumstances please know resources help.

* link post containing different, free mental health hotlines: [**Crisis familiar hotline help, find bit info here: [Hotline America would flourish someone like fauci charge...

Good luck America. agree, although I'm going point year's flu season died 5 weeks early. 

If continue life way we're living now, flu season. one significance, least. 

This guy's warning applicable open back up. another emphasis schools need stay closed. they're closed, issue. organization makes claim doesn‚Äôt prove there‚Äôs sufficient evidence claim. generally injured dying effects COVID. We're seeing post-infectious cases hyper-inflammatory toxic shock, Kawasaki disease, acute myocardial injuries way higher rates normal kids infected COVID. Or, they're proud antiintellectuals. Tho that's probably ""too big word"" them. mean, seven syllables! Though doubt know syllable is, either. Keeping distance best thing do. Outside exercising really excuse stay way 6ft away anyone else. would think exercising mask would terrible, would provide little additional benefit. However need check rules live. Good, Oxford vaccine, one possibly information moderna vaccine possible candidates end year/earlier emergency approval. better. Considering 1918, managed overcome situation rather well lack modern medicine. medicine lack brains people manage various countries like usa brazil. Oh doubt public school teachers massively intelligent. doubt someone favor opening schools without masks, ending social distancing, thinks flattening curve waste time teacher. Separately doubt someone IQ 130 throws pointless comments carry weight IQ scale pretty much breaks 130.

Teacher? Maybe. hope governor closes schools.

Find episode 7 2020: Purged.  I'd really hope not.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*    Yeah, true weeks ago, local governments making mandatory even fining businesses allow customers wear mask. latter real reason working though. nothing Arizonans becoming aware considerate. Careful research shown two biggest determinants rate spread Covid-19 are:
1. density population, and
2. density population. work, start showing refrigerated trucks necessary hold bodies many dying nowhere put them. make fun want. make information false. Go ahead continue looking sources. numerous cases COVID numbers verifiably false. Look immaculate CMS data nursing homes possibly still is. Go look early June CDC totaling anti body tests swab tests stat many people currently infected. won‚Äôt bother explaining problem since seem figured out.

Edit: really accuse echo chamber sub? hilarious thank advice, what's life Northern Canada like? Oh facetious know answer those. saying politics plays huge role this. Lol USA USA USA replied yet, ones scare appear triggering variety autoimmune conditions brain/cognitive damage. Cardiac lung damage bad, dying prematurely later life due early onset copd/chf/whatever sucks, autoimmune conditions make happen even sooner brain health utmost importance.

I might also biased someone autoimmune condition one point nearly paralyzed me, attacked brain, given symptoms people complain times like brain fog, tell would want one people reporting permanent brain fog. 

The virus still somewhat new, maybe people recover, fuck many levels. *wish* covid flu pulmonary virus, reality fuck many different ways. appears somewhat genetic, see one family get absolutely wiped another family completely fine. african west asian descent get hit particularly hard reason, children sometimes things like kawasaki syndrome due covid, covid toes, etc.

Fuck covid, fuck media downplaying severity covid pulmonary disease, fuck positions power downplay covid *confident* people try give warnings saying right they're fully aware. intelligent understand science health implications ... far involved politics want take direction others more. 

Which makes look completely stupid. 

I always tell people, underestimate political opponent, intelligent .... Sometimes choose apply thru intelligence order disagree others. sounds like Daytona Beach FL. don‚Äôt think anyone takes pleasure seeing trump administration strips together headline. see mask social distancing criticis. towards president.

If that's rationalizing it, maybe mental health checked.

What kind mask wearing curiosity? back old case numbers soon. look like this. go diet, loose weight go back eating shit. happens gain weight back. here, go back opening things get results. know know wearing masks. Us people wearing masks , example New York numbers increasing. ""Self Awareness"" aware yourself, must aware others. it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre going live life

Yeah, you‚Äôre especially gonna live life catch virus die study says BLM protests thousands people single large crowd caused spike covid fine covid? Ya studies always benefit left....the smartest guy field always loses job soon says something benefit left....funny is...  Wow, three times many yesterday. Sweden failed hard. specifically told Communicable Disease coordinator HIPPA ""becomes flexible"" public health emergencies. 

I get it. Take big car manufacturing plants example.... employee works production line, ""close contact"" handful people. provide supervisor name positive case, pinpoint, notify, isolate close contact patient. release name, need notify isolate hundreds people plant? possible. 

At end day, agree though. would want healthcare information given others, even positive COVID test. feels invasive. record, hate I'm doing.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Trump administration ordered hospitals bypass Centers Disease Control Prevention send Covid-19 patient information central database Washington beginning Wednesday. move alarmed health experts fear data politicized withheld public.

The new instructions posted recently little-noticed document Department Health Human Services website. on, department ‚Äî C.D.C. ‚Äî collect daily reports patients hospital treating, number available beds ventilators, information vital tracking pandemic.

Officials say change streamline data gathering assist White House coronavirus task force allocating scarce supplies like personal protective gear remdesivir, first drug shown effective virus. Health Human Services database receive new information open public, could affect work scores researchers, modelers health officials rely C.D.C. data make projections crucial decisions.

‚ÄúHistorically, C.D.C. place public health data sent, raises questions access researchers access reporters, access public try better understand happening outbreak,"" said Jen Kates, director global health H.I.V. policy nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

‚ÄúHow data protected?‚Äù asked. ‚ÄúWill transparency, access, role C.D.C. understanding data?‚Äù

News change came shock C.D.C., according two officials spoke condition anonymity authorized discuss matter. Michael R. Caputo, Health Human Services spokesman, called C.D.C.‚Äôs system inadequate said two systems would linked. C.D.C. would continue make data public, said.

‚ÄúToday, C.D.C. still least week lag reporting hospital data,‚Äù Mr. Caputo said. ‚ÄúAmerica requires real time. new, faster complete data system nation needs defeat coronavirus, C.D.C., operating division H.H.S., certainly participate streamlined all-of-government response. simply longer control it.‚Äù

But instructions hospitals department guidance explicit underscored: ‚ÄúAs July 15, 2020, hospitals longer report Covid-19 information document National Healthcare Safety Network site,‚Äù C.D.C.‚Äôs system gathering data 25,000 medical centers around country.

Public health experts long expressed concerns Trump administration politicizing science undermining health experts, particular C.D.C.; four agency‚Äôs former directors, spanning Republican Democratic administrations, said much opinion piece published Tuesday Washington Post. data collection shift reinforced fears.
‚ÄúCentralizing control data umbrella inherently political apparatus dangerous breeds distrust,‚Äù said Dr. Nicole Lurie, served assistant secretary preparedness response former President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúIt appears cut ability agencies like C.D.C. basic job.‚Äù

The shift grew tense conference call several weeks ago hospital executives Dr. Deborah L. Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator. Dr. Birx said hospitals adequately reporting data, convened working group government hospital officials devised new plan, according Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer Association American Medical Colleges, participated group‚Äôs meetings.

While said understood Dr. Lurie‚Äôs concern, Dr. Orlowski said administration pledged ‚Äúa verbal discussion‚Äù make data public ‚Äî least give hospitals access it.

‚ÄúWe comfortable long continue work us, long continue make information public, long we‚Äôre able continue advise look data,‚Äù said, calling switch ‚Äúa sincere effort streamline improve data collection.‚Äô‚Äô

The change exposes vast gaps government‚Äôs ability collect manage health data ‚Äî antiquated system best, experts say. C.D.C. collecting coronavirus data National Healthcare Safety Network, expanded outset pandemic track hospital capacity patient information specific Covid-19.

In new guidance, Health Human Services said going forward, hospitals report detailed information daily basis directly new centralized system, managed TeleTracking, health data firm headquarters Pittsburgh. However, hospitals already reporting information states, could continue received written release saying state would handle reporting.

Senator Patty Murray Washington, top Senate health committee, raised questions TeleTracking contract, calling **‚Äúnoncompetitive, multimillion-dollar contract‚Äù ‚Äúduplicative health data system.‚Äù**

Both C.D.C. network TeleTracking system set Health Human Services rely so-called push data, meaning hospital employees must manually enter data, rather government tapping electronic system obtain information.

‚ÄúThe whole thing needs scrapped started anew,‚Äù said Dr. Dan Hanfling, expert medical disaster preparedness vice president In-Q-Tel, nonprofit strategic investment firm focused national security. ‚ÄúIt laughable administration can‚Äôt find wherewithal bring 21st-century technologies data management fight.‚Äù

Dr. Hanfling others agree information need centralized, disagree happen. Dr. Hanfling called new ‚Äúnational data coordination center‚Äù would used ‚Äúforecasting, identifying, detecting, tracking reporting emerging diseases.‚Äù

Representative Donna E. Shalala Florida, served health secretary former President Bill Clinton, said C.D.C. proper agency gather health data. flaws C.D.C.‚Äôs systems, said, fixed.

‚ÄúOnly C.D.C. expertise collect data,‚Äù Ms. Shalala said. ‚ÄúI think move take responsibility away people expertise politicizing.‚Äù

Hospitals say previous reporting requirements cumbersome, partly frequently changed.

‚ÄúIt administrative hassle confusing constantly shifting gears reporting hospitals front lines pandemic,‚Äù Carrie Williams, spokeswoman Texas Hospital Association, wrote email.
At Rush University Medical Center Chicago pandemic raged, hospital four full-time employees reporting coronavirus data four different agencies, said Dr. Bala N. Hota, hospital‚Äôs chief analytics officer. Rush collected 100 different measures, determined much money would receive different federal programs.

But Dr. Hota said supported streamlining process involvement state local agencies reporting, also concerned months pandemic, United States still established system collecting kind information needed seamlessly move patients full hospital one available beds.

‚ÄúThe C.D.C. right agency forefront collecting data,‚Äù Dr. Hota said.

The C.D.C. criticized data collection, however. May, agency acknowledged tracking spread virus, combining tests detect active infection detect recovery Covid-19. system muddied picture pandemic raised percentage Americans tested President Trump boasting number tests United States conducting.

Similar complaints coronavirus data bubbled around country.

In Florida, former data manager Health Department accused one superiors directing ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù data used state‚Äôs plan lift stay-at-home orders spring. Ms. Shalala said mayor Miami-Dade County ‚Äúwas concerned state data hospitals reporting data directly well.‚Äù

And Arizona ended partnership university modeling team whose projections showed rising caseload, prompting pushback Humble, executive director Arizona Public Health Association former director state‚Äôs Health Services Department.

‚ÄúTrust accountability transparency ‚Äî three go together,‚Äù Mr. Humble said. federal government‚Äôs new system, said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd better keep transparent, else people going think ulterior motive.‚Äù  many coworkers ""friends"" medical field claim we're counting car accidents covid deaths none nurses/doctors area think big deal problem. think numbers inflated medical field actually seeing crazy shit media shoves face. they're dismissing severity it. Past telling nurse whatever elective field covid floor idiot, watch videos hospitals heavily hit, know else them. like talking brick wall. first time approved drug would cause detrimental effects health. happens time. good luck testing kids trials. Normally takes 9 years test approve regular vaccine safety efficacy. 

Here talking vaccinating people within next months, RNA vaccines. far single approved RNA vaccine trying vaccinate large number people, longterm effects known studied, seems little bit risky me. experts concerned autoimmune issues, cancer etc. RNA vaccines vaccines sense, rather drug changes DNA.

And decisions based politics fear science. confuse intelligence knowledge. Many knowledgeable professionals dumb fuck. Many intelligent people could never afford higher education.

Dead economy dead people? I'll take 200 Alex optimistic assume parties keep tracking eye discrepancies? Surely reporting numbers passive enough let government get away fudging numbers, hope.

Even reading back seems like desperation. pro life states really showing out. Fun idea! Send info see gets published? 

Now that's science. (taps head). sub become left-wing circle-jerk now. last time polled?  ‚ÄúI alone fix it‚Äù come ass. ""I'm surrounded assholes."" - Darth Helmet. Drunk, shirtless Florida man harasses people park. yelling adults way raising children.

As drunk, shirtless teacher (at home, alone) amuses greatly. Would perfect analogy kid also said 'and know means can't go hospital get burnt hand treated', somehow tied burning hand also dragging 1-3 people burning hands will. easy smarter still alive. problem, again, stupidity.

The economy never really return faith safe. can't trust numbers, uncertainty extend past actually get COVID control.

There whole chunk top 25% country particular simply go restaurants etc.

This also start creating extreme tension states soon. know already hate idea people Florida Arizona walk MA. Can't get Ugandans Chinese something? jab me? covid emergency? LOL would hope so. 

This like one those, ""yes water wet"" situations.

The act socially distancing inherently smarter stand close someone pandemic full swing think term ‚Äúclusterfuck.‚Äù

As American, beyond embarrassed. Step one: Stop throwing gas it. Officers area declared masks personal choice don‚Äôt police personal choices 

Not beat protesters, shoot eye tear gas/flash bang legal protests, they‚Äôre also stupid help end pandemic position impact. 

There good officers sure, many douchebags many absolute morons. question curiosity, tsa security could wear mask? wonder website ADA compliant visually impared? Maybe reported... brother hates Trump argument him. thinks counting everything guy posted. Trump fanboy thing mass misinformation campaign put people working extremely well. see Americans stereotype, experience Japanese people interacted brutal things would say, delivery polite would laugh along insulted you. Lol. wonder cops decide maskless people need arrested ones need warned... husband John spent 15 days ventilator. entire family tested positive COVID-19. happened 21-year-old son visited friend‚Äôs house took mask.

21-year-old decides hang friends. Gets 42-year-old dad sick, maybe dead. 

YOLO SWAG! Oh, no. horsecrap all. CDC completely totally politicized, starting current director. People fear jobs jobs. ""As Coronavirus Crisis Heats Up, America Hearing CDC?"" , ""What Happened CDC?

Shame country moving towards ""normalcy"" back interact world. Sucks. desperation, legit important question. I'm hoping hope local media keep coverage direct connection state CDCs/whomever handling reporting state levels. I've resisted subscribing main paper state due cost (am currently working), signed earlier today hopes keep independent media working well possible.  really want see crazy, recommend Free Republic. go daily dose ""How worst people America react?"". Though I've seen enough pretty predictable point. What‚Äôs point even governor they‚Äôre supposed leader crisis situation?  target elderly young 1918 mutated killer young healthy 1919? sort pseudo-pragmatism we're situation. entirely possible people stop complacent fight change. intelligent people, like yourself, accept they're given.

Then again, perhaps excited choose two corrupt racist rapists president?  I‚Äôd call wisdom. Lets say infected blood transfusion pack gets thrown, flies next town via heli something


that friend airborne HIV standard lmao walk bathroom wash hands able drink water? usually drink half gallon water per shift... Answer question.

Unless course, can't?

Imagine Biden able unrestricted executive power come into, thanks President's ruinous administration.

You living liberal utopia soon.

Since answer first question, answer this: coming 4 year haze cognitive dissonance feel like?

When reality slaps across face, hurt?

When loses November, bury hate subreddits four years scream rage walls echo chambers plant in?

Do realize support man enabled fail country global pandemic; culpable Americans died lack leadership botched response?

Do know blood hands? even go testicles. 

The penis kept erect trough blood flow cardiovascular system, meaning: heart can't keep pumping blood dick get hard, particularly COVID-19 lead [chronic damage cardiovascular meaning: Worse blood circulation = floppy small dicks. test turnaround times week more, states likely already there. current daily numbers people tested 7-10 days ago. appreciate stories, feel like used anti-mask crowd.


Whenever there's group people masks, one person something doctor operating room gets anti-maskers attention. act like everything else pointless.


But medical professionals, years training, tight group gathered around patient table. even then, one purposes mask, keep medical professionals germs infecting patient table cut open. 


These articles act like mask main line protection. seems general public, others masks help contain everyone else's breath, sneeze cough.


Sure may worn improperly, leak, someone may touch face. people touching faces anyway, one's breath, sneeze, cough trapped slowed mask, everyone risks coming contact virus even more.


I'll take 100% population wearing imperfect mask, 40% damned thing. quarantine requirement Swedes traveling Germany abolished due positive development number newly confirmed corona cases, says German Ambassador Anna Prinz TT. federal states must comply decision.

The rules apply European countries. infection rate lower 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, limit, quarantine requirement raised. Since development Sweden positive, able lift it. looking period days, seems stable trend now, says Prinz. 
\- Right I'm happy.  


In early June, German public health authority Robert Koch Institut (RKI) published map Europe, Sweden marked red 50 per 100,000 inhabitants confirmed infected coronavirus past seven days. federal states opportunity make decisions whether Swedes quarantined traveling respective regions. 


**However, latest decision** abolished quarantine rules must followed federal states, according Prinz. 
\- Yes. take day two seeps everyone reached information, decision new, says ambassador.Sweden different strategy coronavirus Germany many EU countries, implementing extensive shutdown society. 


The Swedish strategy attracted great deal attention German media. Prinz describes past months ""a learning process us"". 
\- think everyone become wiser now, judge months passed know more.Ambassador Prinz says ""the thing careful"", keep physical distance apply ""everything learned protect ourselves"". 
\- numbers fall, good. see second wave holiday period. wearing. glorification incredibly backwards like it‚Äôs major achievement odd received mask alert system another state. couldn‚Äôt figure whether triggered crossing geographic boundary blasted time, helpful information know requirement particular jurisdiction. (I would worn one anyway). I‚Äôve also seen dept transportation message signs mask reminders.  Dude, problem going outside fuck head. Motivation irrelevant too. Social distance wear mask.

Congregating groups issue. positive side Trump irreparably damaged Republican party foreseeable future. He‚Äôs rapidly losing independents / rinos votes matter. wire nose thing mask 5G antenna. makes sense. /s Many likely overstatement yeah, go far say exception. reported happening, people 40s 30s 20s suffering serious ways. 

Don't get wrong younger people risk, considering new findings coming fact virus highly infectious, still eager push people open. avid gamer, essential job. life really changed since everything started, pretty much wear mask public now.  Somehow studies feel like indirect, passive agresive way scientific community calls people morons wearing mask and/or social distancing lol budgeting, too. This. seems nowadays somehow sign weakness. isn‚Äôt people staying home air conditioning spreading it. opened early told people everything fine. Florida still doesn‚Äôt mask mandate. large percentage populations states spend days posting social media mask-less escapades show us still acting like virus real idiots are. It‚Äôs frankly something behold. Except Americans Certainly. support harsh penalties caught driving impaired. lifetime driving bans imprisonment cause accident.

However, punishing someone drank single pint nothing towards solving issue.

Everyone knows guys around leave trail cans ditch. However, cops turn blind eye money talks.

Instead use .04 law harass law abiding citizens impaired committed crime, boast many ""drunk drivers"" caught. easier dealing actual drunks fighting crime.

FWIW never blown .04, think bad policing, excuse write expensive tickets tow cars revenue. Pre-existing condition not, he's still bad shape virus. Stop pushing garbage talking point ""misleading"" *describe* acute symptoms fully due covid, he's diabetic obese. die go ""well *was* diabetic obese covid-related"" terrifying critter listed mormon crickets! *shutter*

Stay safe, Montana! Wow, wow...

I even know start.. Get fuck racist fool want cartoon St. Peter, mask, standing next sign saying, ""no mask, heaven.""  might intelligent, there‚Äôs sign wisdom. I‚Äôd take wisdom intelligence day. It‚Äôs crazy middle-school reflexes still kick 30 years later. 

I‚Äôve puzzling anti-intellectualism; thought today it‚Äôs cycle fear. 

1) Grow told much learning harmful;

2) See people community acquire much learning, along beliefs incompatible worldview;

3) Watch said people eventually disappear community (because find community‚Äôs worldview oppressive);

4) Want remain community, want offspring remain community: Perpetuate cycle. 

But, know, without much introspection. love blaming things rurals first wave consisted mainly people returning party hit spots / Ski resorts. place families kids spent holidays.

Families go skiing time, even small kids. ski resorts also many after-ski activites kids could easily infected. people brought corona Sweden Italy Austria school holiday that's basically made families go ski vacation. people study must stupid. common sense wear one funny, pre ACA young people without insurance always ones needed appendectomy 1am. ""young healthy"" need insurance, I'd drag ass hospital work free. least still parents plans kind insurance. hard say. available science moment points towards kids Europe get sick cases asymptotic carriers. last thing wrote means carriers disease without showing exhibiting symptoms. heard read recently North America. current information covid-19 schoolchildren America. seen kind studies information? 

Yes, really bad almost half population resistant fact science insisting use masks social physical distancing needed. even goes far say hoax. hard time understanding come this. One need listen doctors nurses frontline get real. could read listen facts. hope dawn eventually. others keep talking. Stay safe distance wash hands. 

This still first wave. Spanish Flu hundred years ago go around world three waves took little three years. deadliest waves either second third wave. Historians argue that. complete records time either. heard estimates many people died varies 50 million upwards 100 million. actual numbers. think better see deaths percentages totals population get better comparison todays situation. Things gotten worse CA since mask mandate. Why? countries stoped pushing towards herd inmunity around late March, Korea confirmed first re-infected. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe surpassing red line Healtcare possibilities. reallized people gonna die, try overwhelm medical systems. fair, Center Disease CONTROL. Since administration disturbing portion US seem interested controlling spread COVID. true, thought certain stable genius might vaccine American?  

* Try ""make deal"" US gets (lol) 
* Start trade war country made it
* Ban US 'fake vaccine'
* Simply go full anti-vaxx (while getting vaccine himself)
* above

It's fat lady sings. Yes no. Obviously shitstain central problem. However, Birx, like everyone else screwed hardest, tried strategy mollycoddling outset. never challenged bullshit stood strongly facts. 

She (and doubtless many others HHS) facilitated sidelining science scientists. long since late take back ground given. Introverts: *I SMARTEST* family things important like becomes guardians children, pets, etc, want happen body want this. Moderna executives confident vaccine, can't sell shares fast enough. /S True, White House asking hospitals send data CDC... Great news! need educate anymore! Simply follow best-practice guidelines made absolutely common sense, tout ""mOrE iNtElLIgEnT"" thank others simply showing well practice social distancing!

How come this? lose common sense? many ""woke"" fools cite ""study"" without even analyzing validate premise?

""Does da gud boi want treat?? told practice social distancing, Fido, call 'MoRe InTeLlIgEnT' good boi!"" factory, one wears masks. thing fill 1 question survey asking symptoms. guy research world lab samples? That's cool. data showing asymptomatic cases week day new covid cases? Best show ever created. Erris Mayo. It‚Äôs hour Ballina whatever Galway.

Holy shit thank someone really mentioning Thank GOODNESS Saying wear small piece cloth face prevent potentially killing people ""severe restriction"" extremely privileged view such. Trump really trying lose election: wearing mask  hope trend ends soon! mask wearers, optimistic weeks see decline. Cautiously optimistic. irrelevant. need numbers tests let disease run rampant. barely anyone hospital COVID parts country point. high numbers untested individuals would reflected stress health care system doesnt exist.

The US hand almost beyond point testing still useful virus spread much. Though depends part country. US numbers certainly much much higher currently recorded based high positive percentages coming back mass testing. That's problem follow proper mask removal procedure, reuse [Link here](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf)

Edit : story link either, go back original fox35 story get it. Maybe something like this? complaining side effects shows clearly haven‚Äôt gotten vaccina shotüò≥ Or, know, look anything. He‚Äôs talking small specific areas. believe Bronx levels 60%. Correction: Every country most. Exactly. schools may require doctor note 3 days sick. 2 day sick could grassroots organized, no?

And fact teacher hve taken sick days personal days Texas larger rates, Astros win parade, subs even hard find, nothing happened teachers. Yeah, it‚Äôs bit cluster fuck. Turns coronavirus might bad flu all. give examples ban natural products like aflatoxin (produced molds), radon (which naturally occurs), viruses? 

In general, people reducing/eliminating use dangerous chemicals, since list noted banned already. problem many cannot banned, reduction exposure (risk mitigation like masks, radon systems houses, storing grains mold) best option. 

I love heart right place, really do, already contaminating environment, thousands years since degrade slowly. need make sure never get market first place. 

I feel push better testing products go market, many harmful compounds banned replaced similars unknown risks. risks researched, found bad worse (see PFOA replacements example)! Making sure never make market best option. 

Have nice day! news, water wet. don‚Äôt want hear quarantines WH going forward Trump office. can‚Äôt try get everyone ignore virus simultaneously take precautions virus keep safe. gonna stroke lot egos, congrats you‚Äôre brain dead realize gravity situation, you‚Äôre next Einstein wanting get sick.  Better ""adapting change"".
Many people fight change.
Change scary, uncomfortable.
One reasons many people push back.
Why change? I've never ""social distance"" before, fine.
You must wrong! Positive news sub don‚Äôt go together either IKR - causes spit coffee laugh minute. shit Sherlock! #fuckchina #fuckwuhanflu Ya think???? states employ enforcement mechanisms use prevent minors purchasing tobacco alcohol. Municipalities starved revenue would quick jump enforcement. imagine many small towns revenue streams disproportionately affected pandemic, compared cities. MASK jfc debated topic simple!

This replying to. mention spike cases, yes anyone EVERYTHING stop/slow spread part problem. Masks proven effective stopping/slowing spread airborne (of fashion, water droplets etc.) virus, stands reason people wear masks actually spike cases mention drop. Thankyou sample size small family. CDC apart HHS? hmmm isnt problem countries like India Brazil , hell would say even USA huge amount economic inequality, sure live decent houses ongoing evictions, gonna hard fact Villainy isn‚Äôt boring, guess. need hal-abeoji come USA? Remember conservatives want big government involved healthcare? Grassroots sick out? Good thing budget 42 billion Sorry sorry ...we're fucked.

that's say. young single teacher still may roommates.

I'm older single teacher, kids prefer roommate times becasue added economic security/freedom. I've teacher roommate friends, recently help para wants go back school, I've trying convince sharing 2 bedroom would save money. Lol knows may even job eventually may move family.

If family I'd move them. could possibly know longer term effects though? Angela Merkel also listens Christian Drosten.

Donald Trump listen Anthony Fauci. Yes do. I'm saying lockdown working deaths 6 days etc

If everyone flouting rules like say I'd expect constant increase infections like America  simply case huge majority people following rules miserable person always moan tory probably Fauci culpable misinformation too. need put wide completely fucked every level try start semblance knowing they‚Äôre talking about. Iv social distancing whole life.
200+ IQ confirmed better prepare disappointment, case happens. know am. 

Look approval ratings. hovering around 40% right now. lowest ever 35% early presidency, like 6 months everyone still adjusting abject horror man leading country.

Let sink in.

He CURRENTLY middle critically badly mismanaging US government deadly disease allowed rip population rate many times developed nation planet, killing almost 150 thousand countrymen smashing economy shambles, end sight countries already gotten disease control watching slowly disappear regions things return normal, suggests people drink bleach shove lightbulbs asses quietly fires and/or fucks funding supply anyone tries take measures keep things control.

And that's what's happening right minute. even account nonstop machine gun lies he's spewing every time he's ever publicly opened mouth entire past 4 years, seemingly perpetual scandal entire presidency people dredged truly unbelievable volume shady, unethical, and/or illegal shit he's done life throughout presidency, including fact literally impeached, third one history.

And approval rate 40%.

He well may get re-elected. Honestly gave even odds, I'd probably bet it. Well US fun lasted oh  husband dedicated sub diabetic probably staying home year Arizona also hottest summer weather state. makes perfect sense. believe article speaks ‚Äòwetness‚Äô characteristic solids possess. Hence, say ice wet, water CDC leader also Trump hire, certain extent responsible now. know know nothing shit.  Offtopic: moron wrong/no mask use counter media pictures #3 Right kid would walk barefoot pile flaming LEGO could go back school I'm social distancing going little far. Sweden nr12 new cases per capita world (excluding central south america) last week. lot cases. Norway, Finland Iceland not. sure denmark right likely few. know know. know know. know know. left house 5 times since February, make genius recluse? I'm fine either both.  What? say intelligent lol. I'm saying y'all idiots extremely retarded.

""I'm going say something like youll feel superior millions people""

Yeah, that's Nazis did. right-wing nuts, communists, authoritarians, Russians, everybody else needs prop one portion population trying push another portion population.

You think smarter millions people read article written art major saying college kids likely liberal therefore liberals intelligent? C'mon bro....... idiot Opening schools Disney world bad idea, study says. Mask wearing essential study ridiculous. made stroke ego more. Natural
Selection work website estimates daily r0 every country based cases reported?  People illegal states minors reverse psychology dumb Americans üòÇ administration control HHS CDC? sounds fair.
As reader, hence judge, chalking ignorance, lot it.
People want adjust lives, soon options.
The fix ignorance, awareness. socially distancing almost 32 years, disagree study. kidding. surprised find teachers done actually vote leaders want defund schools, take away teacher benefits, demand crazy test expectations people voted say hate teaching to.

Like seriously, public school teachers Texas hypocrites becasue work public schools, send kids public schools, vote schools lose funds private schools get public funds.

Then teachers lounge talk ahiht great private schools are. Like wtf man? 

Because next breath, look me, special Ed, ""oh there's never enough money supporting students special education needs, feel bad you. inclusion students can't get support class, struggle me.""

I dare say, well help change vote. Texas, everyone Republican, even majority teachers. 

But Seriously? I‚Äôve genius since 2004 (launch World Warcraft). offtopic: picture moron mask nose. #2 guy dumbass Karens freaking masks public?! Coronavirus sure gonna disappear think less intelligence insanely stupid everyone believes mask poltical issue. context, back, estimated 1/3rd world's population infected. 50 million **died**.

And given bulk cases centralized right now... he's right, hoo boy, bad me, *really* bad America. say value discussion yet insist framing such.

Either live society people agency responsible lives, not. Either live society people free hold alternative viewpoints own, not.

It's dangerous view dissenters dangerous rest us. locking would bring us territory authoritarianism.

""Following imposition state saves lives"" good enough. dangers Covid-19 poses us population blown far proportion, causing us forfeit, fear, important right self-governance self-responsibility.

US done fewer tests, test-positive rate CFR would still markedly different. country really full handle excess deaths average added calculus.

Truth is, though, Japan low numbers people hospitals, comparatively minuscule death count pretty telling. live Japan, complain lack testing. even true numbers 10x reported, Japan‚Äôs deaths would barely exceed state Massachusetts alone, despite would double case count (at 10x rate). that‚Äôs comparing entire nation state US likely many world quality medical facilities per capita anyplace earth.

It also means death corona since July 6 - is, Monday last week.

The number inpatients similarly stable since Tuesday last week either 17 18 inmates.

The daily update also includes 24 new confirmed cases, well 30 cases past infection. was, I‚Äôm genuinely sure said this. 1918 flu believed impacted fact sick soldiers taken away frontlines back hospitals etc mingle population, meaning virulent type spread rather milder. There‚Äôs pressure here. actually opens criticism basis hyperbole, etc. would say it‚Äôs wisdom, intelligence. Wish knew said it, even exact quote... there‚Äôs quote goes something like, ‚ÄúTrue wisdom lies knowing not.‚Äù words, realizing lack knowledge, makes wise. So, knowing listen smart science boys, makes wise, intelligent. Slight difference. 1984 hell. took virus seriously hiding data. family completely convinced huge conspiracy. mega thread cited data someone compiled, try sprinkle conservation them?

See response. shit There‚Äôs virus Ba Sing Se wise man said, slow testing down... Aldi tends pay pretty well.  #1. #1. #1. Honestly, consider Fauci semi-god among mortals, comparing spanish flu seems pretty dumb.

The thing is, time Fauci cautious says, press takes words context make headlines watch whole video says, always makes sense, context. guilty this. thick accent, north south, makes think less intelligent. proud think intentionally let go Florida red-neck accent. working understand said instead said. I'm massage therapist boss thinks hoax. wear masks service, clients don't. 80% people I've seen think bad, hoax etc, wearing masks talking traveling vacation. I'm certain nothing changes family get it. Moderna recent release, honestly, seeing peer reviewed data exciting. released actually much higher quality data normally see- get preprints.

#Many dead

After little San Marino, Belgium country Europe hit hardest per capita corona crisis, around 9,800 dead. Although number new cases dropped dramatically recent times, still concern spread pick speed again.

Last week, example, requirements wearing face mask tightened apply stores country. Face masks already required public transport, airports railway stations. Understatement century Big Mask corp charge! Dictatorship part informed consent hard get here, informed really possible. know everything virus long term effects virus, therefore can't properly informed consent. Sweden: 

TenYearsTenDays: **Sweden's death count increased ‚àû% compared yesterday!!!** social distancing masks work well, better, coronavirus. Obviously read study yourself, goal help policy makers improve compliance social distancing. 
As show low working memory capacity linked poor compliance means point setting fines, example, people influenced simply keep heads. frequent signage reasons social distancing might effective. CDC, mild side effects flu shot include soreness, redness swelling injection site, low-grade fever aches. **Only 1 percent 2 percent people get flu shot fever side effect, Schaffner said.** God bot utterly useless. sweden nobody wears masks all. Uhhhh, ask many did? That‚Äôs even better!!

Or one?

‚ÄúWhoop 5G‚Äôs ass...wear mask!!‚Äù

Whatever takes, right? I'll give little secret right now, lean close, *that's literally intelligence is.* always someone smarter better shit. Learning them, taking advice, learning mistakes, makes intelligent. Id actually rather prominent doctor president right now....alas.....


Meanwhile Birx finds new scarf wear.... get downvotes everything say sub :) ok. know mom step dad would doubt choose give life versus mine child's. That's parents grandparents naturally think. Thank God virus dangerous kids. thank God every day that. pick choose whatever want justify behavior.


Like worried unemployment, businesses shut down.

Yet places started reopening, counties relaxed others people work would go way avoid masks.


Need haircut, barber gone years requires mask, drive next county, see new barber mask.

Your comments first impeachment baffling, guy withheld military aide provided American tax payer personal political gain. We're pretty much going hit records couple days ago out.  science. Rural areas He‚Äôs Felon... Inbound ~your comment removed people can't handle political comments. fallible, yes, leading charge wrong directions. America, evangelical Christians strong supporters mask free movement, push indoor mass gatherings, want schools meet plan prevent death damage decisions cause.

That's lot worse fallible. That's culpable. knew I'd find trash bottom! #RealMenWearMasks fundamental reason need masks. don‚Äôt always know it.  death rate 100%, that's 67,400 deaths result. make numbers.

But actual, realistic death rate 1%. That's still around 600 deaths could totally preventable, realistic number. whistleblower Tanzania put something online? similar story, people social distance cutting highway anymore. Yeah, I'm fairly certain even commented speculated article written. Swedes gonna take vacation can't leave country, vacation industry would see net gain. Since official definition popular vote, yes/no/maybe. almost got majority votes. schemes replace electoral college would triggered run-off election would gone one-on-one Trump.

However, reasonable definition popular vote Trump won. Aha, gotcha!! 

Maybe so...plus us ADHDers generally pretty smart...we seem otherwise neurotypicals. Lol others might asymptomatic spread further. Shame never got tested. :( want this, lower cost filters, transparency.

I've trying smile much eyebrows, think able show face, even foggy cloud chamber N95 mask, would aid much emotional communication... Karen doesn‚Äôt wear masks. Karen protects liberties. Karen tRUe pAtRIoT Must pandemic growing America. Lots unintelligent people. probably won‚Äôt, let man fantasize 

Unless won‚Äôt stop harassing, I‚Äôd rather say thing argue insane person. That‚Äôs ridiculous. lose it? We‚Äôve historically averaging 10% tests taking week processed. Last week 35-50% taking week. labs far behind ridiculous. easily 80-100k queue. summary/calculations last week.

Edited add one lab post info showed yesterday 62k tests queue. I‚Äôm sure many labs one. particular lab primarily covers Maricopa county. lot employers let come back work without negative test...so that's 26 days find positive 26 get negative test back.  That's long time go without pay check There's hidden agenda, Administration hidden agenda definitely people health life. $$$ suggesting yet another datapoint campaign targeted harassment waged weeks now. 

As one top mods said paraphrase: anything clearly connected pandemic worthy discussion here, matter small is. please stop 'this minor discuss here' stuff. world live in? Worldometer, Johns Hopkins. deviate slightly.  stock market current connection economy. either continue live fantasy land rude awakening. really is. Well duh keep virus ? dare US ? aren‚Äôt numbers reported state found state‚Äôs webpage? Right? They're also hiring teachers dedicated online-only version people want it. Also offering version online-only family gets dedicated teacher, $63K. Hopefully. They're looking volatile substance throw it. Everything government done made situation worse point seems like goal kill many us possible. Putin must watch news fully erect. never met Canadian didn‚Äôt superiority complex America. mean main personality trait. Canada always second rate that. 

I also think many Canadians let ‚ÄúCanadians nice‚Äù go head. majority nice. nasty, ignorant people. society never less racist people refuse believe anything ‚Äúnice.‚Äù  heat humidity Yes drink alone rationalize alcoholics even worse spend time families hate.

My take least yet yourself. looks like stirring pot reason. order like 300 million doses oxford one.

I‚Äôm you, people upset this. Also wondering congress could block change reporting change, seems unlikely.  Example what? Cases go NYC months make happy satisfy desire people die unnecessarily. fact Covid compared 1918 pandemic tell everyone bad thing is.

Fauci compare Covid Spanish Flu. author article made up. provided quotes article even considered stretch. completely made clickbait headline.

Covid-19 serious, 1918 flu monumentally worse. Articles like irresponsible happens headlines circulate right-wing circles they're going believe Fauci thinks Covid-19 bad Spanish Flu damage reputation. People listening science intelligent...more news 11 May!? Are* 4 year old like that. tell something, it.

That's people like, 4 year old. Bunch babies. 

I solve problem 4 yo way Maryland's governor it. make face drastic consequences.

Getting caught without mask Maryland like $5,000 fine. Every state that. mask fine money go families lost loved ones covid.

But yeah, know someone family die still wear mask.... ""Home Christmas"" dude shut fuck up, Fauci spent life dedicated epidemiology basically pulled US AIDS pandemic. sit home spends hours hours day learning virus. Absolutely true. buddy 36, healthy, great shape. Got late March. dealing chronic fatigue, lung capacity issues medical problems. Docs know solve it, whether ever go away.  Damn writing Financial Times good. That's lie. LA public health mayor said contribute. cities reluctantly well. Social distancing implemented riots/looting/arson/statue vandalism/shooting beating innocent people/psycho protests. Conclusion, based article's logic course, selfish low cognitive function, low intelligence, low memory, low IQ idiots. Haha well least get fit same-price normal bike! Maybe Trump getting Russian bounty every covid death. kidding... Sort of.  I‚Äôd love see try put mask toddler. Wait minute, are! people social distance stupid fuckholes! WAY! can't believe informed.

/s interesting me. like they're dumb, even believe intelligence real. People use big words try impress complicated ideas order confuse them! Africa pretty nice  make sense. WTF trying say? Funny thing allegedly also say people intellegent also underestimate inlelegence, know limitations capabilities opposed stupid people think know all. Thank link. seems good study. ""problem"" it, mostly old people (median age 62), cases severe cases COVID. undeniable long term effects, I'd want see incidence population large.

The ideal study would like see would something like this: make serological tests find statistically significant number positives (let's say 500), take 500 negatives randomly tests, compare groups cardiac damage, etc. hoax. Fake news. 

/s obviously  tell college students, download bloody app. üôÑ Woah! *may* intelligent? also mean *may not* intelligent?!? /s think anything want, stop spouting misinformation fact. do? Villages bit outbreak early seemed get control - honest one. Bold Prediction: Friday going 6 figure day.

Finally good news 2020. fact place put ""No shirt, shoes, service"" developed country first place scares me. ""Killing old vulnerable people"" completely okay you? monstrous already killed Americans WW1 did? mention increased risk stroke, possible brain damage many side effects STILL KNOW YET. 

Even 0.1% fatality rate accurate (It's not, nowhere near actual scientific estimation) it'd still horrific.

The US truly populated sociopaths. seems incredibly unethical, sketchy, fucking dangerous American citizens. kinds fucked. right accurate transparent health data. going screw data fit agenda. feel like I‚Äôm living totalitarian state? didn‚Äôt sign this. don‚Äôt want live anymore. fucked. mention that? are.

Maybe trashy mother air dirty laundry world see, shaming son actions... make less son's fault. trick endure much stress growing naturally balding 30. Haircuts? mean slight touch shave give every six months? Lol people show death counts August 15 so.  

The deaths seeing today 'new cases' month ago (June 15). 18,000 new cases June 15 (wiki), 900 new deaths yesterday. 

So, yeah, month, we'll probably seeing close 3000 deaths day (i.e. 911 terrorist attack every day). ""lag"",

This wrong statement, almost feel like intentionally lying. translate fucking sentence, genius, English, ""This one Fourth July family buddies Ohio Army vet gained‚Äôt ever neglect."" second wave prevented (or atleast most) people wore masks indoor spaces?  medical condition would prevent someone wearing mask. reduce oxygen. doomed photosynthesize comment completely.

Both testament reminder depths human selfishness stupidity future Americans believe they're better everyone else, we're problems, clearly caused external factors.

EDIT: Also, Americans hate government telling do. Even government *right* many Americans would rather opposite government advice cause ""The gubment can't tell do!"" consider wearing face shield protect eyes. prefer tsunami. They're still competing limited reagents excess testing. like Facui dont think agree meaning ""inadvertently""

Dont @ me, Im heading covid party. Later nerds. positivity rate testing surprisingly slow incline thus far, although July 4 impact really coming play. Possibly data showing spike coming. case, largest cities state close ‚Äúlevel 4‚Äù status, suspect lay detail means status gets updated Thursdays. Honestly, that‚Äôs excuse. It‚Äôs comes entitled.

""inadvertent"" host fucking ""corona party""? claim mask mandates work proven using Germany example? We're gonna China see.

Watch curve start ""lowering"". Here's read Florida's detailed reporting test results clinic, clinics reporting negative tests (or report few) mostly quite small look though represent around ~3% positive tests Florida.


Bottom line: liberal conspiracy, system functioning 100% accuracy, like systems. anything small sites likely highly Republican areas Florida would easier argue purpose Republican conspiracy sites ammunition attempt shepard sheep want go. decent leadership, message would ""please let us work together get cases control open schools again."" Given behavior friends exhibited: really think going respect quarantine quarantining two weeks well? People eat carrots may intelligent, study says Who's Good girl! Who's good girl! are! are! (my dog good boy ha even social distancing humans too) okay hallmonitor support something terribly wrong people say bodies paid actors That's another symptom societal rot.

Instead, find someone locally feel superior towards hold them. case, KIDS.  god fake abandoned you. evidence protests increased cases covid 19?

Sometimes even say ""oh god!"" way hell God mine believe concept. dude needs good sip water nice chair sit heck in. I'm sorry people bung holes exposed you. Keep wearing mask fingers crossed perfectly fine! Best luck. point start calling Miami Vice-rus? Florida Flu? No. Go take death camp strategy elsewhere. long you‚Äôre high risk, that‚Äôs it.

Hardly comparisons two.

That said would much better position old Trump Stump would start listening experts like Fauci various issues. Amusingly enough, Sweden's vacation business appears see substantial net increase revenue due international travel damage he's country going take decades fix. break party, broke country I'm thinking get shut back down. makes difference I'm ""essential "" may like what‚Äôs still store... Horrifying story. 395 awaiting test results.

-Probably Let live fear-mongering power fantasies, much lol  mean, get it? free world distance itself? Maybe something changed numbers reporting. Narrator: weren't. Unless im mistaken, reports reinfection anecdotal.

There study Korea, studies China. 1-3% patients test positive 2-4 months later, half symptoms. Indicates either reinfection possible disease relapse/remitting - I'm honestly sure worse... *Is North Korea?* Call want that's still eradication. means ""destroy completely"". destroying anything. virus would still around even masks. They're 100% protection. That's like saying condoms eradicated STIs everyone uses them. nobody believes would, even everyone used one time.

Influenza makes jump species. Swine flu 2009. There's new one potential China. results look bad, imo. 40% got fevers it? wtf? going get approved numbers like that. data going available public raw form. speculation, they've actually said publicly available. We'll get doctored numbers, like China. Please read study. scary surprising. still defensive rude percieve personal attack. means I'm insulting beliefs way means probably lying. could chalk feeling anxious situation, thus rather snappish insulting random strangers case I'll say feel sympathetic.

Common sense says less severe body experience fighting it, way know large pool reinfected people (as opposed couple anecdotes) study with. definitely look needle, least. 80% get long term lung damage corona lol. 

Sports fine, survived Spanish Flu bubonic plague far, far worse diseases. Indeed. grateful live Ma. yesterday Stop N Shop, every single person saw wearing mask. doesn‚Äôt appear anti mask bullshit (or small minority) I'll need cite numbers extra cases specifically protests.

Masks great, they're shields extended situations. virus running around country, probably best go back normal sharing other's air large batches.


So normal vaccine means much economic activity possibly have, masks, without large shared air gatherings. I'm suburbs north Cincinnati. Weird thing last couple weeks I've go out. number masks greatly increased. know governors DEFCON map declaring area level 3 (out 4), news insanity south.

But trip grocery store currently 80-85% coverage. probably closer 50% month ago.  Depends. antibodies attach virus fail neutralize it, reinfection would severe due antibody dependant enhancement, seen Dengue Fever, SARS, Ebola, HIV. growing body anecdotes SARS2 may experience ADE circumstances... people get damage serious cases, usually people old obese. say however vast majority people affected. 

Again Sports fine. far worse outbreaks disease football, rugby etc came side fine. Haha remember coronvirus taking sealed mouth nose plastic realize basically sealed shut. 

I could take slow breaths otherwise plastic clinged face suffocated me. 

Still. 4 months still alive. Rabies extremely slow, actually chance you‚Äôre exposed actually gets brain get point return. Plus, don‚Äôt get vaccine exposure. would also get dose preformed anti-rabies antibodies time. Crazy shit. feel like 2-3 days long. havent gotten good answer return normal. 

Anybody go CT, infect 1-3 people, even thats happens, CT back normal time infection already they‚Äôll screwed month.

But, mostly go back normal everybody wears masks restaurants take only. doesnt seem open bars they‚Äôll need bail outs. Probably things like gyms indoor physical activities, like trampoline palaces kids. retail retail like activities fine masks. Tell employer that. Thank you.

Until it‚Äôs law, nothing want keep job. appreciate though sentiment agree you. Well advanced medicine back then. flu hit would've significantly less deadly. sure knows he's talking about. life's work all. But, but, but... MuH FrEeDuMbS! Lol okay. know American. no, always true. side effect could death. fact, here, people hospitalized highest dosage. everyone getting COVID hospitalized. 

Moreover, really bad we'd giving nearly everybody, everybody get COVID (the Spanish Flu infected 25% world's population, instance). 

I'll pull numbers nowhere illustrate point:

Lets say 25% world's population would get COVID, would kill 1% people get it. 

Meanwhile, nearly 100% world's population got vaccine killed 0.5% people got vaccine..... 

twice many people die vaccine even though safer getting COVID. 

Again, pulled numbers less hat, think illustrates side effects vaccines taken really seriously, even really bad diseases. DHgate. Got pack 50 $1 apiece excuse higher rate US except malign influence Trump. Except, course, article report reality Sweden seen net increase tourism. need travel disappear that. People finding new ways tourists positive effects short long term, Swedes spend time abroad tourists spend here, means usually outflow consumption. people stay home, good country's tourism industry, instead find new, corona-safe ways Sweden.

Guess whose accents changed most? ones went London, ended working finance, marketing etc. Canada, mate Germany. feel need change significantly, implicit bias were.

Saying otherwise lie CDC stop doomers buying PPE away hospitals definitely needed more. suspect US things violent perhaps one want job, employers want liability job?

Vegas hot anyway  Piblicfreakout gonna hell week. I'm going I've read past seem done reading familiarozation have. good news information granting me. mean misinform. much information sometimes hard keep even feel like keeping up.   I've enjoyed watching spreadsheet last couple days. help understand data Arizona's current status? (Not math, math minor) 

First, think ""a zero backlog"" fair goal assume state wants attain, it? state performing 15,000 tests day going \~15,000 backlog unless processes put place drive tests labs multiple times day waiting specialists, probably peak efficiency. 

Phoenix particular trouble processing tests recall correctly. unwarranted assume Maricopa may lion's share backlog, correct? counties backlog, referenced above, could normal backlog scheduling keep specialists working efficiently. 

Best case scenario then, Arizona's ""backlog excess"" might low 50,000. 

My biggest question I'm trouble reading ""Total Tests"" tab. June 30th reported 24,076 tests (cell Q8) date 23,348 processed (cell B25). makes sense me. July 2nd 13,511 total tests (O8), 21,666 (B23) processed? simple ""reported daily date (row 8) change see daily (which fluxuate due reporting delays) later (column B) become aware number tests truly taken day.""? confirm. drove Midwest south, person really seemed care wearing mask. five separate states. 1) two things statistically linked mean relationship absolute one causes other. Plenty smart people stupid shit, plenty stupid people sensible shit. stupid shit inherently make someone stupid, statistical probability stupid higher otherwise would be.

2) possible social distance protesting, high rate mask use among BLM protesters outdoor setting made practice relatively safe. Anecdotally, fiance number protests, kept distance others, avoided catching COVID. Empirically, analysis COVID infection data shows BLM protests appreciable effect current surge mean, yeah... hospital administrators would love could start getting money again... kinda hard hospital ""play along"" fake numbers pretend free hospital beds left elective surgery. absolutely wealthy neighborhoods throughout various cities Alabama. Make sure record it, could call people vs walmart Probably it‚Äôs South Dakota addition /u/KazROFL 's point, cited sources, please claim.

The statement released Walmart mask requirement hours ago no? 

Should seeing lot news articles social media videos soon. Lots Karen's man children getting undies twist wearing mask 20 mins store.

Fucking stupid people...what waste  legal companies force employees come office fully capable job home? anyone know precedence this? Im guessing kind SOL situation thought I'd ask. validity cases reported question. real issue. time can't trust assholes television telling truth, political motivation. press used politically neutral, now. go White House tests pretty much instantaneous.... lol [go I'm certain studies [take account exact potential sources harm specifically speak them, right? 

Right?

You possibly copying pasting studies favorite conservative news sources told never actually telling FDA advised using HCQ clinical setting, could you?  person wrote said felt terrible downplaying virus someone knew sick it.

No comment.

There's physical barrier entry. im like...‚Äôreally? first thoughts?‚Äô went walmart near morning private security guards company front, likely enforcing wearing masks, first time whole time. almost feels like experiment see shitty job make still maintain staff hospitals already running of. amount medical supplies properly treat covid extensive, hospitals already resort older, less reliable medicine treat patients with.

And ICU's already turning people away multiple States.

The US fucked mortality rate already higher 1% especially fat diseased average american is. Yeah - wfh since March lol many Walmart customers died? Pretty sure disposable.

I rotating masks, one every day week. sure long I'll keep using ones. Maybe per month? Forget intra-party feuding, great 4 months election, intra-administration feuding press four months election national crisis. Katrina steroids. historically inept administration ever? Maybe Andrew Johnson getting impeached party, part lacked Lincoln's management huge egos?

We're watching real time shit-shows shit-shows.

Retail workers get enough credit, THANK YOU!!!

I'm Canada adoption wearing masks mostly universal, refuse. That‚Äôs good point. Hungry children typically pairs poverty, meaning couldn‚Äôt afford dr hospital bill. likely cautious. Though parent works outside home, arranging childcare could expensive, may likely send school keep job. don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs whole mess point. First battle epic Walmart mask war? Jeez, even Nebraska got test Saturday, got results 5PM Tuesday. duty police call police

A lot local police departments sheriffs outright stated enforce mask wearing, good luck live places. Fighting anti-science anti-science create science. city US. particularly large city even state. Thought norm everywhere. literally said contact authorities. nothing. allowing people without masks violating bylaw. say medical condition, employer, business believe you.

So going force way business? I'm sure would go well court 

A business deny entry large number reasons, including wearing mask regardless say medical condition not.  Chefs kiss recently watched episode! LOL! U okay buddy? want see share link please Good. Finally. people actually get much done without someone keeping tabs person. may think true much is.

It's like talking bunch heartless vampires laugh face death ... death others ... even death.

Kinda obvious tbh. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) defined illness caused novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), first identified amid outbreak respiratory illness cases Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.¬†[1]¬†It initially reported December 31, 2019. January 30, 2020, declared COVID-19 outbreak global health said started December. still spread winter. Uhhh zoom want... sure it‚Äôs zoomed there, it‚Äôs pretty clear it‚Äôs showing. Europe deaths US. situation looks even worse focus Western Europe. Western Europe fewer people US deaths. numbers Western Europe US continue rise rates. claim otherwise data literally provided proves deaths lagging indicator. decreasing trend cases takes time decrease reflected deaths.

Sure, there‚Äôs evidence there‚Äôs decreasing trend cases. evidence fewer people getting tested Europe. deaths US Europe still increasing rate. That‚Äôs data shows. speculating increasing number cases found US lead deaths. that‚Äôs speculation doesn‚Äôt account fact Europe testing less.

It seems like convinced narrative based feel read news doesn‚Äôt match data shows. linked graph showing trends deaths US Europe it‚Äôs pretty clear deaths almost twice high Europe continue increase rate seen US. possible 2 weeks things look different? Sure. one asked speculation.

In reality, aware CDC taken chain, probably reason people stating Trump wants control information.

However, CDC still job, part may calling discrepancies data falsification it, CDC still going see data even they're ones collecting it.

Enjoy first award. It‚Äôs almost like population density exists! immunity all, herd immunity. infection induces immunity time, people immune contribute herd immunity long immune. enough people immune given time. reinfection immunity booster immunity, reinfections actually good thing, happen immunity decreased.

Actually several/a lot/most/all? virus reinfect us. never encounter virus again, immunity get lost, common corona lost years, chickenpox several decades. 

One important point: herd immunity mean nobody gets infected. means single infections spark epidemic outbreaks. too! relief. touch-up last night. Hoo boy i‚Äôm ready ton anti masker videos Lmao one dumb fuck US realized fallen self-proclaimed pedastal 'best country earth'.

I saw world map recently Americans welcome/not welcome due Corona. literally whole planet Caribbean exceptions Kosovo.

""Many viral infections affect skin, it‚Äôs surprising seeing rashes COVID-19,‚Äù says study author Dr Veronique Bataille, consultant dermatologist St Thomas‚Äô Hospital King‚Äôs College London.

‚ÄúHowever, important people know cases, rash may first symptom disease. notice new rash, take seriously self-isolating getting tested soon possible.‚Äù

Commenting study, consultant dermatologist¬†Dr Justine Kluk¬†said:

‚ÄúThese findings highlight importance keeping eye new changes skin, lumps, bumps rashes. Early reporting COVID-associated rashes members public recognition significance frontline healthcare practitioners - GPs, NHS 111 hospital staff - may increase detection coronavirus infections help stop spread.‚Äù

Dr Tanya Bleiker, President the¬†British Association Dermatologists, explains findings important:

Yes mentioned masks masked ended really feel like guy, knows home is, might robbing something I'm clock. That's get ya. Throw 16 hour likes it, yet 16 hour basically scraps Yadda yadda yadda. 

You used two critical Swedish articles ""proof"" Swedish media less critical nordic media. Ivanka Trump suggest unemployed ass ""try something new""... lol @maisyandtaija . . . Data the¬†COVID Symptom Study¬†shows that¬†characteristic skin rashes¬†and ‚ÄòCOVID fingers toes‚Äô considered key diagnostic signs disease, occur absence symptoms.¬†

The COVID Symptom Study, led researchers from¬†King‚Äôs College London¬†and¬†health science company ZOE, asks participants log health new potential symptoms COVID-19 daily basis. noticing number participants reporting unusual skin rashes, researchers focused data around 336,000 regular UK app users.

Researchers discovered 8.8% people reporting positive coronavirus swab test experienced skin rash part symptoms, compared 5.4% people negative test result. Similar results seen 8.2% users rash coronavirus test, still reported classic COVID-19 symptoms, cough, fever anosmia (loss smell).

To investigate further, team set separate online survey, gathering images information nearly 12,000 people skin rashes suspected confirmed COVID-19. 

The team particularly sought images people colour, currently under-represented dermatology resources.¬†

17% respondents testing positive coronavirus reported rash first symptom disease. one five people (21%) reported rash confirmed infected coronavirus, rash symptom.

The rashes associated COVID-19 fall three categories:¬†

Hive-type rash (urticaria):¬†Sudden appearance raised bumps skin come go quite quickly hours usually itchy. involve part body, often starts intense itching palms soles, cause swelling lips eyelids. rashes present quite early infection, also last long time afterwards.

‚ÄòPrickly heat‚Äô chickenpox-type rash (erythemato-papular erythemato-vesicular rash):¬†Areas small, itchy red bumps occur anywhere body, particularly elbows knees well back hands feet. rash persist days weeks.

COVID fingers toes (chilblains):¬†Reddish purplish bumps fingers toes, may sore usually itchy. type rash specific COVID-19, common younger people disease, tends present later on.

Although COVID-19 often thought disease affects respiratory system, rashes reported number cases people China Europe hospitalised severe symptoms disease. However, first largest study systematically gather data skin rashes milder cases wider population. Thank you! I've said time time again, protesters absolute morons staying inside ffs must yuuuuge house [report article cites New England Journal systemic adverse events common second vaccination occurred 7 13 participants (54%) 25-Œºg group, 15 100-Œºg group, 14 250-Œºg group, 3 participants (21%) reporting one severe second vaccination, participants 25-Œºg group, 6 (40%) 100-Œºg group, 8 (57%) 250-Œºg group reported fever; one events (maximum temperature, 39.6¬∞C) 250-Œºg group graded severe. 

This 45 person study, we're already seeing severe reactions. suppose we'll see studies bad is, bode well safety.

Secondarily, article published yesterday (July 14th, 2020) examines pre-print UK antibody study finds dramatic decrease antibodies (to point potentially losing immunity) 2 months. I'll pull quotes responses coronavirus peak three weeks onset symptoms, begin decline little two months, researchers Kings College London study,¬†published Saturday on¬† preprint server MedRxiv¬†and yet peer-reviewed, examined antibody levels 64 patients six health-care workers tested positive virus Guy's St Thomas' NHS foundation trust (which runs several London hospitals) March June. also monitored 31 members staff volunteered regular antibody found levels antibodies fight coronavirus peaked three weeks onset symptoms declined. 60% people tested study ""potent"" level antibodies average 23 days following first onset symptoms, 16.7% level antibodies 65 days first signs researchers noted study found antibody response Covid-19 similar human coronaviruses, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) seasonal coronaviruses associated common colds, individuals' antibody response tends ""wane time, little 12 weeks 12-34 months research calls question much protection individuals coronavirus subsequent reinfection, durability potential Health Organization officials said Monday patients recover Covid-19 may able get coronavirus again, citing similar studies suggest immunity may wane months.¬†

In summary, appears antibodies created response COVID short-lived vast majority participants. brings question effective vaccine could be, given majority participants study lost significant amount antibodies 2 months first signs symptoms. course, still need studies conclude level antibodies necessary immunity, still concerning news.

It unexpected, however. coronaviruses problem, one many reasons we've never able develop effective vaccine them. seems vaccination would need happen often every month effective finding, that's assuming deal mutations virus constantly goes through.

We still need conduct research around immunity, narrative traditional one-time use vaccines seem they're going effective combat COVID. get hopes vaccine already requires 2 separate doses, produces severe side-effects small scale.

We also need consider we'd able mass-produce vaccine similar used across worldwide population every month.

Fauci: ‚ÄòBizarre‚Äô White House Behavior Hurts President
The nation‚Äôs top public-health expert tells Atlantic isn‚Äôt going anywhere, despite Trump administration‚Äôs newest attempts undercut him.

PETER NICHOLASED YONG

Anthony Fauci
DREW ANGERER / GETTY / KATIE MARTIN / ATLANTIC
Anthony Fauci isn‚Äôt quit, despite White House‚Äôs clumsy attempts stain public image. point uneasy partnership, seems President Donald Trump wants rid Fauci, he‚Äôll need fire him. recent days especially, White House stepped efforts discredit Fauci, move describes ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù

‚ÄúUltimately, hurts president that,‚Äù Fauci told Atlantic series interviews week. ‚ÄúWhen staff lets something like entire scientific press community push back it, ultimately hurts president.‚Äù

He described White House attacks ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù ‚Äúcompletely wrong.‚Äù also seemed dismayed coming time COVID-19 surging across country, deaths rising, Americans remain deeply confused keep loved ones safe.

Targeting Fauci seems like tragic misuse White House time energy officials‚Äô aim defeat coronavirus. Trump appears concerned discrediting Fauci. weekend, White House sent multiple news outlets document smacked opposition research. carried list statements Fauci made COVID-19, purporting show contradicted outbreak ‚Äúhas wrong things.‚Äù one example NBC interview February, White House omitted Fauci‚Äôs full quote, giving impression he‚Äôd misjudged outbreak‚Äôs danger. Peter Navarro, Trump‚Äôs top trade adviser, wrote op-ed USA Today yesterday claiming Fauci ‚Äúwrong everything interacted on.‚Äù (A Trump communications aide tried distance White House op-ed morning.)

Peter M. Shane: Trump shouldn‚Äôt able fire Fauci contradicting him

The attempt discredit Fauci‚Äôs public-health expertise political move, one disastrous implications. much Trump wants needs Americans see virus nuisance that‚Äôs soon overcome, Fauci recurring reminder crisis remains grave enduring threat, Trump mishandled pandemic. Americans believe White House‚Äôs anti-science campaign risk cutting potentially life-saving information.

‚ÄúI cannot figure wildest dreams would want that,‚Äù Fauci told Atlantic, reference White House document. ‚ÄúI think realize prudent thing do, it‚Äôs reflecting negatively them.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain Peter Navarro,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs world himself.‚Äù

My colleague Ed Yong spoke Fauci two interviews past 24 hours‚Äîabout oppo him, private discussion later White House Chief Staff Mark Meadows, nation‚Äôs faltering response virus‚Äôs resurgence. follows edited combined transcript conversations.

The Atlantic: 36-year history director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, anything like ever happened you? think White House‚Äôs claim made inaccurate statements pandemic?

Anthony Fauci: stand everything said. Contextually, time said it, absolutely true ‚Ä¶ [The White House document] totally wrong. It‚Äôs nonsense. It‚Äôs completely wrong. whole thing wrong. whole thing incorrect.

Read: pandemic experts okay

The Atlantic: White House this?

Fauci: don‚Äôt know.

The Atlantic: government‚Äôs top health adviser, government you‚Äôre trying advise actively trying discredit you. work like that?

Fauci: Well, bit bizarre. tell you, think sit shrug shoulders say, ‚ÄúWell, know, that‚Äôs life fast lane ...‚Äù

I think sit talk people involved list came out, really, think, taken aback big mistake was. think talk reasonable people White House, realize major mistake part, doesn‚Äôt anything reflect poorly them. don‚Äôt think intention. cannot figure wildest dreams would want that. think realize prudent thing do, it‚Äôs reflecting negatively them.

I can‚Äôt explain Peter Navarro. He‚Äôs world himself. don‚Äôt even want go there.

The Atlantic: met Monday Mark Meadows, White House chief staff. tell him?

Fauci: said particularly good thing do. Ultimately, hurts president that. staff lets something like entire scientific press community push back it, ultimately hurts president. don‚Äôt really want hurt president. that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. told thought big mistake. doesn‚Äôt serve good purpose we‚Äôre trying do.

The Atlantic: Meadows offer explanation apology?

Fauci: No. apology. said didn‚Äôt know it.

The Atlantic: Given experience, still want work administration? thought resigning?

Fauci: No. think problem important get kinds thoughts discussions. want job. I‚Äôm really good it. think contribute. I‚Äôm going keep it.

Read: Anthony Fauci‚Äôs Gen Z cred

The Atlantic: There‚Äôs reporting Trump administration tried cut back TV interviews. Isn‚Äôt important moment nation world hear you?

Fauci: can‚Äôt make comment that, think know answer is.

The Atlantic: update us relationship president?

Fauci: Well, scene changed bit. frequent press briefings, opportunity personal one-on-one talk president. haven‚Äôt done while. day go contact Debbie Birx [the White House coronavirus-response coordinator], Bob Redfield [the director Centers Disease Control Prevention], Steve Hahn [the commissioner Food Drug Administration] others. input president goes vice president. clearly, vice president‚Äîliterally every day‚Äîis listening say, there‚Äôs doubt that.

The Atlantic: know don‚Äôt talk President Trump often?

Fauci: No, don‚Äôt.

Read: Anthony Fauci‚Äôs plan stay honest

The Atlantic: Everyone knows talked fact indefatigably honest; reputation, someone always tells truth. tell us truth federal response pandemic?

Fauci: look numbers, obviously, we‚Äôve got better. We‚Äôve got almost reset say, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs stop nonsense.‚Äù We‚Äôve got figure out, get control now, and, looking forward, make sure next month, don‚Äôt another example California, Texas, Florida, Arizona? rather games people playing, let‚Äôs focus that.

The Atlantic: much worse expect pandemic get? get back better place?

Fauci: pushing reset button, don‚Äôt mean everybody locking again. We‚Äôve got call time-out say, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going open, we‚Äôve got get everybody team.‚Äù I‚Äôm going name states‚Äîthat‚Äôs helpful‚Äîbut states did, fact, prematurely jump checkpoints.

Even though middle setback now‚Äîyou can‚Äôt deny that; look numbers, you‚Äôre dealing 40,000 60,000 infections day‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going defeated. states trouble right now, states pause say, ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre going right, everyone wear mask, bars closed, congregating crowds, keep distance, protect vulnerable‚Äù‚Äîif weeks row, I‚Äôll guarantee numbers come down.

Read: week America lost control pandemic

The Atlantic: recently published piece burnout among public-health experts trying fight pandemic. clearly much part that. doing? coping?

Fauci: I‚Äôm okay; I‚Äôm fine. running bit fumes, say, fumes really thick. It‚Äôs enough keep going. wish didn‚Äôt lot distractions, think noise gets way. put aside, try let bother me, move ahead.

- preprint abstract you‚Äôre referencing states nAb levels declined, common viral infections. nAb take account memory B cells (which quickly ramp Ab production re-exposure) cell immunity plays important part overall process. Also declining levels antibodies seen natural infection, immunized subjects. 

You‚Äôve come far reaching premise needing vaccination every month isn‚Äôt supported without logical fallacies. Considering many ""my dad/daughter/bff got it, GUYS JOKE!!!1!1"" articles lately, guess work start losing colleagues. Thank you. noticed before. recently become interested since seem moving fast vaccine. Still help, meijer,target etc requires masks( giant sign lots saying government required) people wear walking immediately take get past door, plus couldnt find one employee properly wore mask mouth nose.

Yes! saying coronavirus spread protest without distancing masks? Decades right wing conditioning. Glad end day common sense prevailed Voter suppression going incredible, COVID-19 blame time around. I'm counting chickens. successful vaccine developed distributed year. accomplishment happens. better damn well enforce then, Walmart day saw least 10 people wearing mask properly acting like walked store wearing get took inside Thanks, yep, there, good stuff. :) Redditors unironically saying going friend‚Äôs house party 20 people causing virus spread going BLM protest 1000 people distancing wearing masks causing spread.

I promise Trump come MAGA face masks said, ""We're gonna let Chinese Virus win"" absolutely could gotten supporters wear masks. Humans 100 years look back time contempt disgust, make mistakes again. Coronavirus rate drops 0% Keep mind corporate. personally confirmed this, folks local Facebook group claim called Walmart check told would enforced local store. Different reporting sites - think Johns Hopkins.  Jeez. 26 days go Negative dead. Hopefully lead competent surgeons medical professionals leave shit hole country. local Menards apparently missed memo. twice last month requirement. don‚Äôt know young people issues virus. virus causes previously unknown syndrome children MIS-C. Children died virus. problem seems way predict children might die. Also, idea children anyone else long term effects even mild cases virus.[june 29 article multi system inflammatory disease children shows 300 reliable studies seen looks pretty good. one found decent levels 90+ days. ""Using sequential serum samples collected 94 days post onset symptoms (POS) 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, show seroconversion cases neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses sampled beyond 8 days POS."" 

The study said antibody lasted couple months based estimation models, actually follow swabbed patients. thicker Russian accent, better. anti-mask snowflake triggered? ""THIS MURICA, CAME BUY CHINESE-SLAVE MADE GOODS"" Strange way write ""I evidence prove point talking ass"" Yea around workers bad customers comes masking. Exactly! finger pointing China‚Äôs lack transparency, we‚Äôre guilty‚Äîand so.

Also hypocrisy blaming China Covid Trump left borders open Europe (Italy number 1 hotspot time) full month China blocked. Remember unmasked hordes JFK coming Europe? surprise, surprise!! NYC became epicenter. least coming November, vote us stop taking crazy pills.

It bad access bottles FUKITOL. Hey, first. Let‚Äôs start over. mean ‚Äúus‚Äù? proceed Well states already require hope niece safe now. They‚Äôre gonna RABID Thankfully see masked ppl Walmart. gimme popcorn! Wow, they're 6 months late! oh no, pick black shirts, gonna called black panthers gave much FREEDOM! /s

I kind need haircut, I'm going DIY it. anyone keep people taking masks get 20 feet away entrance though? see time. mask get door hangs ear covers chin they're actually store. Look take personally mean jab you, $23/hr extremely well. Good. hope every business same. Wrong flair. East Asia. point trying make? im talking states tbh, travel states virus spreads quickly, one state ok, state next door shitty gets in. USA big ( land mass population wise) states normally bigger countries. Nations cut border movement stop spread, merely suggesting thing, populations comparatively. Idaho even trying, Washington is, people get sick die idaho full people dont listen reason. Social Distance + Masks Always, contributing, thus part problem.  
I BLM protesting spokane every opportunity (mask sign, crowd), idea on, hate trump, white supremacists support him. im talking preventative action instead waiting dont social distance/wear masks keep virus bouncing around perpetuity. really troll. 

You throw scientifically sound reasoning circumstantial data window ooze meaningless vaguaries like ‚Äúat end day idea you?‚Äù

You provide evidence real reasoning whatsoever question data dozens studies don‚Äôt even bother read. 

By logic firefighter wear gloves, respirator, boots, *and* jumpsuit, wearing boots go burning building halfassed safety measure.

I‚Äôm advocating selfish little pseudo intellectual you‚Äôve taken anti mask mandate crowd‚Äôs superficial appeals idea due process.

Admittedly work coming dick time. Lol sadly seems shock value controversially gilded statements way *really* grab people's attention. posted elsewhere I‚Äôll copy here.


So far tell actual study behind paywall take opinion caution. Intelligence area expertise, opinion study kind of....meh (again without able see performed).

1st ‚Äúworking memory‚Äù defined intelligence one facet intelligence. measures well Retain information something short term. would imply aren‚Äôt willfully ignoring information overwhelmed amount information. doubt case (in opinion). don‚Äôt think people overwhelmed info think simply ignorant don‚Äôt care try. maybe actually functioning lower cognitively, either way working memory one facet. 

2nd) said correlation isn‚Äôt true fluid reasoning intelligence arguably important measurement overall intelligence.

3rd) saying surveyed people can‚Äôt determine actually measured facets, can‚Äôt imagine went actually tested folk individually nationally normed IQ test. would interested results. stand seems like nothing correlation.  There's population factors consider. population Italy, especially Lombardy region, much older Germany US. Overwhelmed hospitals also contributing factor Completely agree - get past front door greeter, there's one inside store going around remind people masks chin-guards. frustrating, wish stores would spend little bit time ensuring customers complying five feet inside doorway. 
 
And also correct stores primary place community spread occurring - bars nightclubs, local churches, smaller friend/family gatherings 15/20/25 people weekends. said, *some* community spread still occur indoor shopping places, can't discounted entirely. Sure does. 1 tbsp contains 20% daily iron many people absorb much effectively sources. little, late. gives shit Fauci says

Nobody knew pandemic Same. like truck. dislike cars. also like idea better assisted self driving. Yup. can‚Äôt tell many times I‚Äôve heard won‚Äôt need masks November...Somehow cling onto belief done purpose hinder Trump‚Äôs re-election efforts.

It's hopeful thinking honestly. There's way they're effective. addition mask? Sure, little extra help hurt. what‚Äôs take Trump wearing mask now? Two post says winter worst problem ever American Health. whole sub nothing fear mongering.  already happened mcDonald's Oklahoma city people first started wearing masks. really sure get directed anger liberals specifically, agree shit schools.

Unfortunately particular Walmart always least 1 cop scene. started nut cop got arrested pretty quickly, pretty hilarious. fair point, bit flippant. sincerely hope contained stopped.   thing seems find way get even obscure places though guess fear continue spread cross borders. read article? like outright refusing anything. assured family everything right, maybe part. fucked going friend's house removing mask. Great see private sector step government leaders failed us. 

There stores Walmart set precedent. Also r/entitledbitch fake news Millennials typically defined 1981-1996, 24-39 years old.  imagine money could spent. could Mars point, real Healthcare real support people, actual failing infrastructure, etc.  went one yesterday didn‚Äôt say shit There‚Äôs storm a-comin say anyone social distance stupid. study states there's correlation.

Why hard understand? I'm currently day 8 waiting Southern California. Initially told way 5 7 days. call told wait 6 10 days.

While Northern California took test twice move south. week apart. test took 48 hours saw results.

The tests last Cal first SoCal 5 weeks.

It's ridiculous unprepared state handle numbers stark difference two counties.

I think beginning. going front center 5 years min user thread wisely pointed Walmart afford hire security. needs happen stores. 

I'm curious would expect security guard wear mask? Security guards power law enforcement retail security guards often earn bucks minimum wage. 

My security guard front door/line management (ensuring certain number people store)/mask ""enforcement"" since store policy city statewide store manager - sternly ask person put mask. refuse either call police trespass person let person in. directed ask people put mask, offer cheap mask one let matter what. 

So basically would need actual law enforcement officer parked every store stack prepared trespass paperwork trespass every individual refuses wear mask. It‚Äôs hard understand rational people. Hopefully 3 months get back normal. ""Florida man refused entry local Walmart unleashed pet gator amongst masses"" Seriously though, people freak encourage wear mask FACE. ""I apologise sir/ma'am, please keep face fully covered store"". lose shit. hate it. waited long that? need volunteers, lots recovered people time. 

Hopefully nobody ever shows ER saying, ""this can't coronavirus, already last year multiple tests prove it"" - soon say. Ya think?! read ""thin strips velcro"" immediatelly though something like that: 

Don't know hold though. What's 3 days going hurt. That's going cause people say ""You give time get mask"" even though intention wearing one. *Will cough cough* 
*So Covid may advance* 
*Some fall scoff* 
*Will mask take chance?* Didnt seem issue places. ~~'exceptional'~~ *special*  I'm hating you. money would ever thought possible back learning save great that's I'm well life. poor well life. poor people well life, there's money. Everything struggle, getting enough food struggle, keeping electric struggle, phone, car insurance, gas. Everything balancing act there's enough money cover putting fires constantly. 

I went prison 19 got 25 job prospects skills. shack came stolen cable. 19"" crt TV, chair trash, burner tracfone, mattress white Hanes shirts Walmart. show day labor 530 want work day. leave 14 hours later $50 lucky. get picked day get nothing. afford see doctor hurt myself. afford tooth fixed pulled wiped out. work went back prison. pay $7 day probation costs went back prison.

Honestly even bad compared people. people kids take care home all. least box shaped structure hold possessions stationary location keep relatively safe dry. extra money put away. money. know got out? Washing cars. started washing cars gas station talked way parking garage big office building built something. employees. paid taxes.

Anyways get poverty. work way out, learn new skills easy. able bodied? illiterate manage business? There's reason stealing selling drugs popular options poor people cycle incarceration poverty continues. hard there. kinkshame. Happy cake day strange, it, early months year, risk much lower, employees getting extra pay, celebrated heroes, they're lot danger statistically speaking, put position enforcement policies deal worst people extra money's mostly dried up. shit.

Although deaths increased number small compared happened New York. Im nurse nearly fifty years experience sitting forever may never return nursing all. things simply worth personal sacrifice me, Covid one times Yeah doesn‚Äôt seem like many districts give staff virtual option Personally local area (Canada), good reaction stopping covid spreading. require masks store yet, nobody town contracted aside elderly retirement homes. *knocks wood* Tiaras everywhere.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* It‚Äôs required state retail stores, stores allowed ‚Äòenforce‚Äô rule, still let shop serve them. doesn‚Äôt anything unless police hand tickets... happens continue nothing. shooting August 2019. last remaining victim died April. Well then, that's another reason keep in-person schools closed. stat kids vaping regularly? Something like 20%? stupid? Sure want to. someone trained ever touch face touch notice. remember many times someone tele said ""don't touch mask"" 20 seconds later themselves. guess decontaminate hands etc times hour feel real threat you. Seems like would life though actually rates concern you. one else going think.

As said, experience living ""masks normal"" culture one takes anywhere seriously people never worn masks yet behaviour claimed significant aspect disease control.

You whatever extreme measure want make feel better believe help. every person pain arse another one tempted wear mask experience.

A half arsed mask better none.

If everyone wearing except one person one dick person going cave peer pressure unless vehemently wearing reason. reason probably ""someone dick previously"".

If feel gatekeep (or whatever hell word is) proper mask wearing think priorities askew myself.

The best way, IMHO, encourage mask wearing are, like me, basically nobody authority force simply make normal let peer pressure work.

But hey sounds like wearing mask want want anyway go nuts, might right. There's real data except observed Japan / Korea / Taiwan stuff knows. wearing big mask constantly creeps eyes pull see again? brilliant. Thank service putting Karens place! start today? It‚Äôs already 3 months late delay longer. here. sad governors made state mandate companies implement policies. sure well work masks enforced everywhere. barely wear pants cover chonies there. Remember motto
""The Karens coming"" Fuck Walmart wear masks Wednesday Could go detail felt? slight fever minor fatigue 2 days, broke morning. also slight headache think might thinking much. feel like symptoms common cold flu. It‚Äôs weird time feel weather without convincing might covid. stupid thing say. use hyperbole truth bad enough, especially gives ammo crowd says ‚Äúsee, intentionally making seem worse really is.‚Äù

Come on, Fauci! ...they already!?! context: 50% cases 2 places, Memphis Nashville metro areas. two places mask mandates 2 weeks now. Memphis also never left phase 2 reopening, means lot places never opened (movie theatres bowling alleys etc.) everything else (restaurants stores) limited capacity. Nashville went opening rolled back Phase 2 two weeks ago. Mask adherence pretty good Memphis least. case rest state. Yet two cities driving surge - bigger populations, huge disparities healthcare may primary reasons. North Carolina. don‚Äôt want people die all. problem lot older, obese people aren‚Äôt best health seem determined die reason pure stubbornness. believe taking full precautionary measures, point can‚Äôt save someone themself. There's obligation let private business either. amazing reality live in. Hey fuck guy. worlds changing people like passed by. blows mind, thought states/stores requiring already? mass refusal wear looks exactly like would expect president flight attendants union look US government could see logic wanting crisis quickly news lol? USA screwed... Jesus Christ Twitter replies. many Karens gonna boycott Walmart. Lol. Good luck. Walmart basically LAST grocery store easy common sense measure. It‚Äôs sad it‚Äôs true ?? meant sarcastic? Yes, would single biggest factor eliminating virus. Competent leadership made virus go away almost every country. sure mean places. Mind sharing via links look into? used work customer service desk. happy avoid type job ever again. felt like week city Florida like March May can‚Äôt remember exactly. enforced all. Talking herd immunity strategy. Herd immunity everybody‚Äôs objective, preferably vaccine. doesn‚Äôt mean strategy. Excellent. makes clear. anti-vaxx different packaging. honestly negligence, malfeasance point. anything, they're actively making wrong choices every fork road. Yes. right shop store say nonsense like ‚Äúno masks store‚Äù etc.  anti mask exclusive one party think he's speaking ""how got here"", place infrastructure testing volume, components (large machines) long lead time, can't ramp up. neck gaiter provides minimum protection. Notice easy breath one provides almost restriction. good indicator much stops. take word it, here's list 70 papers discuss masks cover neck wear surgical mask want protect others, wear N95 KN95 want protect yourself, wear N95 KN95 without exhaust valves protect both. oh man, feel 70 year old filipino man walmart. hes nice hope walmart doesnt make bouncer agree like poking holes silly arguments. don‚Äôt think necessarily political. There‚Äôs virus causing massive economic damage. lot deficit hawks promote saving spending precisely moments like these.

The problem Obama‚Äôs administration spending time amazing economic recovery. offices adding concepts. initial point include less wet, said always wet made wet.

Heck even accept logic water planet ""100% water"" argument collapses almost immediately. July 20th? Let's rush fences. understand what's going us

[The President wants stop testing mother California lot pain Carpal Tunnel needs surgery yet wait 4+ months since it‚Äôs life/death. 

You thank young people failed take seriously (and still failing) - world left hands, can‚Äôt wait see outcome. Hickstremists. exactly narrative refer Good thing it‚Äôs you! assuming local state health departments continue release data public been, right? many people hang info every day, know time tune updates. can‚Äôt imagine info going away without torches pitchforks coming out. Right? b/c attending class. attending trip zoo.  Well, yeah. got fat sitting lungs, makes hard breathe even without mask lmao mean said students don‚Äôt marching band can‚Äôt band activities, say so? can't wait. think vaccines provide protection even still get it, won‚Äôt bad. don‚Äôt know vaccine works like don‚Äôt publish useful information. 75% likely die UK work retail. 

Can't imagine would much higher across pond. Fauci trolling like OG! How? data county reported, cdc outdated worldometers tracker fyi vegan approach taking advantage weeds? test animals humans? brother works Walmart, city recently ordered mask mandate. says people wear get door immediately take off. lab professionals, like myself, left field work pharmaceuticals, IT, etc. stress hospitals many reference labs high.

And terrible pay skillset requires. Fuck Mitch. supported Fauci along troll turtle ass never right thing need salty. asked question 35K deaths 243K cases. understand vast majority cases detected mortality 12%. states 140K deaths 3.5M cases. talking death per million here, talking case fatality rate  flaired ""World""? really take *that* much intelligence.... shouldn't, anyway. talking shit us midwesterners too? Death Despair, particular order. Tardy party  admit I'm surprised see Fox News release articles like this. always assumed avoid releasing information odds Trump's agenda. case, Trump suggests virus control Fox News implying hell not. would jump ‚Äúlockdowns caused deaths‚Äù (completely speculative, moment) instead obvious ‚Äúthe deadly novel virus caused deaths‚Äù (already proven)?

I think ask idea many people died novel virus have. stopping accepting overwhelming evidence disease deadly, perhaps even deadlier, official numbers show?

What caused make explanation people died (lockdowns), instead accepting deadly novel virus is, fact, deadly?  would like point test reliability falls time, many people waiting week longer \*get\* test, time got swabbed viral concentration longer high enough register positive. lot negatives results actually positives got missed due testing delays, people failed notify close contacts previously contagious, facilitating spread. race, people losing.

Variation False-Negative rate time:  I'm tucking one away later.   weirdest timeline. Honestly writers even make effort more. Like, murder hornets introduced episode 5 ??  People need assume act accordingly  Fuck everyone else's rights get COVID tho. rights matter. think gross misinterpretation. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre willfully ignorant fucking people thread there‚Äôs way it‚Äôs 1 20 dead. 

~140k people died US virus. Let‚Äôs idiotic rounding like make feel comfortable numbers. We‚Äôll say 200k actually died even though that‚Äôs real number. 

If 200k people died, 1 20 rate (a 5% death rate) would mean we‚Äôd 4 million cases. know true have, conservatively, 3 million confirmed cases probably millions unconfirmed. It‚Äôs understatement say 5 million+ infected. 

So no, math doesn‚Äôt add up. makes sense idea get saying shit like do. Let‚Äôs honest, point way ends US vaccine enough people getting infected least form fire break regards immunity. **139 clients exposed two symptomatic hair stylists confirmed COVID-19: 67 clients agreed tests Corona: one infected! customers wore mask, less people barbershop (25%). lesson- wear masks! Social distance, reducing people inside buildings.**  SF same, subtle way.

I'm waiting results exposed co-worker, results ""only"" 6 day turnaround, make appointment get tested delayed 7 days done two counties away.

A ~13 day response time, next chance person exposed knew started testing process day, means results showing people already developed symptoms. we're one cities ""doing well"" Ah, playing Texas Rules. worked *great* us. Ok - I‚Äôm Walmart now, then, buy much afford Monday. can‚Äôt wear mask can‚Äôt online shop. So.....off goüëç done months ago it‚Äôs meaningless don‚Äôt actually enforce mask requirements. feel bad fragile old women local Walmart guarding doors. handling incoming bullshit (: think come October another 2 3 million dead globally. key factor population affects kills. spanish flu killed young. far huge population. one kills elderly population pool much smaller. valuable outside. I‚Äôd like see Gates foundation hire lead fighting virus North America. Big L Karen‚Äôs world üåé  debate finding compromise cautious approaches quick reopens, feel like trying negotiate virus itself, like things would okay found middle ground infections virus responding sweet, sweet genetic material critical load cases healthcare system southern states overwhelmed. Yup.  

Welcome 21st century humanity: still can't learn shite 20th century humanity. 

The cynic see's large global reckoning coming this. Wait u get tested That's traditional greeter position usually given elderly disabled. Receipt checking different job. every Walmart. I'm guessing amount shrink location. one worked fired disabled woman worked years nobody station teenager roughly count people tablet. mean, kind does. point, difference political opinion.

It's someone agreeing racism (and dude, give bs CEO poc; drink well white supremacy well), murder, treason, massive personal spending tax dollars, list goes on. 

It's politics anymore - moral failing. backwards states people dumb? exposed ignorant country is. Seriously. People going things open. actually yes Darwin wins again! Wonder long it'll someone AllLivesMatter shirt shoots Walmart employee asking wear mask? THOUGHT ALREADY THING I've wearing nice n95 mask still wondered people complained. wore reusable mask holy fuck absolutely reason complain those. 100 times easier breath through. Fucking assholes need start wearing them. Roll-Tide!!!!  would try correlate this? sounds like classic hoplophobia, Walmart going dangerous normal. fact mask thing place ought safer. crowded church gatherings lots singing help, that‚Äôs god wants. course money Pretty embarrassing big chains beginning require masks federal government mandates nationwide, latter ever even happens. Even US? comply?  big simplification I'm scientist vaccines give people antibodies t-cells - different things contribute protection.

Some vaccines produce antibodies t-cells - vaccines, probably require higher level antibodies vaccines produce antibodies t-cells t-cells compensate lower levels antibodies.

But essentially, t-cells antibodies better.  Maybe got bird flu emu. Oops. Except scientists organized professionals already dealt number pandemics live Florida approve message Oh god - wish grandparents never left! USA crying covid. fudging numbers positivity rates....

Here call far left. movement thinks free speech, rationality, science, democracy, liberalism, meritocracy, individualism capitalism bad things immediately get rid of. proposed alternatives things let discover own. get twitter activists 30 followers. get top sellers Amazon ""White Fragility"", currently #2 charts, act scriptures whole movement, academic side, feeds started.

Everyone (minus imported assholes crazy people) wearing masks appropriate, everyone (I'v seen) good job keeping distanced. 

The biggest issue moment imported cases people flouting quarantine cross border (which ""closed"" remains open people claiming driving Alaska {many fact driving Alaska wanting summer tourist land filled pestilence}). masks

Monday? RIGHT NOW?!?!?!  2 months late Number COVID-19 Deaths Based Actual Reports; Flu Deaths Estimates.

"" last six flu seasons, CDC‚Äôs reported number actual confirmed flu deaths‚Äîthat is, counting flu deaths way currently counting deaths coronavirus‚Äîhas ranged 3,448 15,620, far lower numbers commonly repeated public officials even public health Alright, that's interesting! Thank confirming that. wonder mine start guys suits outside soon then. mysterious sounding. buh muh freedumb! Come Canada, need workers willing work. definitely safer U.S. one place stupid trashy people love go Walmart.... this... interesting. I've noted elsewhere COVID-19 par Spanish Flu *because we're getting 1% IFR modern treatment*. 1918 flu killed around 5% infected, time health care basically ""you'll get better die"". 1918, oxygen support, much less ICUs, monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, immune modulators, antibiotics secondary infections, etc. *You own*.

COVID putting 5 - 10% people hospital. minimum, that's going oxygen support *which exist 1918*. believe significant percentage people requiring hospital care would died then. Everyone needing ICU care would almost certainly died then.

Basically, COVID, we're seeing untreated death rate within ballpark 1918 flu, added bonus infectious disease. We're able fight better medical care keep lethal. New Zealander agree comment. would like see fair access vaccinations worldwide low priority. feel guilty enough watching happening hard hit countries meanwhile life back normal every way. ride small world terrify sickness right them.

Dude, alternative accepting things bad here. acting like two plans, hide forever get Covid.

There isn't, pointed got weird. quote like  Abbott sent covid patience nursing homes lock up!!!! /s post conspiracy group. Check authors, they're hyperlink nonsense conspiracy website. links gates, mask ""truth"". see anti-vaxxer brief view, toxic look website long.

EDIT: looks like might actually bulgarian organization, they're comprimised offguardian.

This conspiracy group put article claiming covid19 deaths, european society disputed:  Get job big, spread grocery store requires masks I'm aware wrote something it, play deer headlights act. Take notes countries took dictators power! He's actually (or was, minors) pretty cool dude. pandemic inequalities dont matter anymore. Good know. It‚Äôs amazing many people commented either read comment understand it. never said anything NYC containing virus prior protests.

I'm pretty sure know you. risk, deadlines, efficiency masks social distancing, possible side effects vaccination. decades let common sense work analysing information gather 3 languages sheeps follow what's told.
Just conclusion someone somewhere made people following social distancing guidlines intelligent literally stupid af. pure propaganda making people feel ""the right smart way"" instead raising questions.
Social distancing buying snacks shop ain't going work 10 minutes later sit pub eating pint beer.  Self promoting comments aren‚Äôt allowed, dumbass. Wal-GREENS alive sound Karens! [Karen Diss Music Walmart still seems appropriate. know right? asked guys something months ago.

But...

Well, 1% population gotten CoVID19 far, lots left protect, plus science behind masks effective pretty clear now, hospitals pretty packed definitely need use masks slow rate spread. checked Operation Warp Speed website goal stated 300 million 31 January 2021 closer right. Good luck Old data time people either hand picked WFH hired role. people hired work office thrown WFH preparation. thanks! laugh, Trump dies end month, I'm converting.

""rocky"" Trump's demonstrable ignoramus barely knows difference &amp; Down.  Unfortunately, making masks ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù U.S. still won‚Äôt get everyone wear them. people would rather go jail wear mask. Armed security insane, want people die  assume Joe Biden's fault somehow. 5 cases restaurant work at. One employee recently fired concerned wanted take weeks off. Im concerned want lose job. feel trapped. today cottage country one siblings lives, guy told can't enter grocery store without mask resulted assault store worker, guy ramming store vehicle, armed standoff cops I'm pretty sure ended dead, news explicitly stated detail yet, SIU investigating fatal police-involved shooting. told wear mask. blows mind. 

So yeah... curious see insanity results Walmart crowd ""freedoms"" infringed upon via mask mandate. US: great place visit wouldn‚Äôt want live given choice

The virus bring bunch underlying issues head causing large divide people. Stay tuned November 3rd real fireworks  Alright, protesters wear masks. feel better?

I'll honest, sit try think *anything* worse current administration doing, I'd really struggle. Maybe letting fly nukes, that's it. Fortunately, states still posting numbers something easily hidden. nurses heroes fucking proud us Nicola. One best leaders far. critical trends, ""have countries flattened curve?"" look U.S. I've looking every day. arent making choice regions though? Yeah, that's I'm saying working boost access limited.

I already see articles written they're pissed US got like 2 million doses got like 200,000 doses- ignoring barely covers percentage US population, healthcare workers alone millions need, US states people countries list.

Even fair scenarios, US going need most, piss people off. US going export can't even vaccinate high risk population. UK India also indicated export vaccinated. much less problem UK says smaller population.

No one's going agree equal is. get closer doses. Walmart run Asdsa UK..couldn't give fuck anybody.. 2 months b4 took Covid seriously... Run Yanks..lol..
Lucky U.S big population experiment on. .nearly .. 500, 000 infected week ..keep trying üëçü§û Even Slurms McKenzie got partied out. may well this. large number people perceive dangerous shop there, hurting profits. 

We know recent study people socially distance generally intelligent not. huge stretch imagine careful enough want shop somewhere perceive dangerous wealthier average (there likely correlation intelligence income). would mean likely customers likely buy expensive, therefore profitable, items put off, enhancing effect.

I'm US, shifted shopping habits lower end supermarket higher end one, time. Part reason feels safer less busy social distancing seems better observed. really think hide them?

They need stop pandemic, need say stopped. shorting SPY boys? One might argue US entered war Spanish Flu likely originated US would pandemic would isolated couple states US (while Europe stalemate) Ah, see saying. Yeah know much longer immunity T-Cells reports suggest could bit more. Also US topic lockdown Oxford's vaccine gets approved IMO. added explanation ‚Äúlead time bias‚Äù comment reload, visuals helped lot understand. 

We continue see hospitalization rate rise, though may flatten simply run beds. Canada still dense cities, though live farms. Good strawman. fucking shit Sherlock RemindMe! 5 days! Larry Kudlow analyzing data. worry. Sneak peek: reopen broadly send kids back school. fact opinion? Share sources. lol beyond fake news. like bad writing assignment failed Trump U really wish things regionally like NY (unless I'm missing something). reason punish areas. Weve person dining open 50% 8 weeks malls open region. I'd bet lot money Texans die result Covid New Yorkers. Florida too. 


We know deaths lag infections, guys spiking end sight. next months going disaster quite states feels like fraying Florida Man Makes Beer Run Large Gator Hand spreads easily sure, spreads exactly like similar viruses.

She issued mask mandate little ago, people lost fucking minds.

Obviously, one planned protesting COVID-19, venting feelings like can't timed. keep thinking maybe government said nothing protests - well, would enforce breaking up? police protested against? seems like recipe increasing amount violence. know - feel like completely right answers.

That rejection letter feels bad coming government insurance company. screwed either way.

You also need compare levels disposable income. tend pay taxes income assets well endless stream fees Americans spend money buying insurance, not. reason rich people go US care poor people feel quite lot comfortable here. Lol, every single Kohl's I've always empty Minor comparatively speaking; fever, cough, covid toes, dizziness, lack balance 4 weeks. Wow...

So typical republican/ass hat thinking

Not real real, hurts people dont like!

Oh wait...  pockets. could care less people. ""Well, carbon monoxide levels getting trapped immune system?!!! media say that??""

\-some Karen, maybe IIRC noted N95 masks, worn long periods time (hours?) say issue people lung conditions. course lung condition much better small risk associated CO2 buildup enormous risk Corona getting lungs I'm South Carolina I'm wondering included. It‚Äôs amazing easy life people need go pay lift heavy things. say most. Look though. plenty scientific evidence many viruses like flu originate Asia. I'm saying China specifically. Goddamn liberal math required state shops Germany. They're going need extra security sure took test March still heard back NOW?

Why almost another week?

Also Kohls online pick instead shipping keeping locals employed minimizing interaction. Newsom able mobilize ABC shut bars heeding orders, CalOSHA shut - gym also workspace. 100% compliance. let without one. I'm not, I'm introvert shut in. Yeah sir Wendy‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs set one timers like... 9 months now! Anyone know how? Reckon us still around? can't work dead either. would rather 10 unemployed relatives dead one suppose depends well get family.

Edit: Down-voted someone thinks better dead unemployed. He‚Äôs never denied that, knowledge. lot kids tested positive within state, didn‚Äôt really seem care. lot schools don‚Äôt funding available conduct mass testings weekly. really meaning Darwinism, Charles Darwin person Sooo boring. miss Russians, knew propaganda - knew come it, subtle.  surprising good news people hope would be. know epidemiological studies 10% infected contribute 80% spread people infect anybody else covid 


These two hairdressers could part not-super infectious majority face masks could ineffective 10% super spreaders. I'm saying case, given sample size two, really know paper. North Korea democratic? that's call themselves.

Sometimes rhetoric match reality.  govener ""Nazi"" trying keep things getting control.

Oh my...What mess made. Cool, hopefully bigger studies continues show promise bigger risk co-infections TB, influenza, etc. volunteer kick anti-maskers face free largest non-federal employer US drain America exactly? simply wished stopped experiencing symptoms soon possible? Perhaps know workers mimum wage actually dependent wages (like half? students middle class families)
Perhaps know definition minimum wage arbitrary.
Lol wut.
Perhaps might also know minimum wages intended living wages, instead meant entry level jobs disadvantaged could increase labor value experience eradicating jobs creates social immobility traps generations poverty?
Who kidding, never read anything academic. take glance pennsylvania /r/coronavirusPA sub. idiots around

edit: Especially rates pay. went get haircut morning (barbers hairdressers opened doors Scotland today). strict procedures. appointment only. two customers time. Temperature checked allowed mask. Staff masks face shields. Hand sanitizer entering leaving. felt safe reassured danger there. Idk bout you, I'd rather unemployed dead...  pay 17.00 box lol. kidding, right? last 4+ months? America GODDAMN THING want to, hear me? MAH RIGHTS, MAH FREEDOM, GO FUCK PEOPLE INCONVENIENCED, etc. etc.

Mental Health-grade narcissism name, 'MERICUH! Yep. Two-parent households boat. told ‚Äúchoices‚Äù- either choose work money live childcare everyone put risk, choose work everyone home safe environment, run food, electricity gets cut and/or become evicted. America, land free... true think personally it‚Äôs highly unlikely, actually see might finally want it. receiving scrutiny countries people country well way corona handled. (Not mention deaths) Hang second - said - severe testing here. Japan doesn‚Äôt 22k cases, Japan probably 220k somewhat more. Severe cases tested, death rate probably somewhat accurate, 4.5%, .45%. 

Now, already mentioned above, won‚Äôt true handle excess deaths included. Japan certainly some, many won‚Äôt clear figures reported throughout system. It‚Äôs similar US, though reporting standards analysis probably differ details.

I completely agree testing problem. also know fair number medical professionals here. least live, Covid wards empty. People die, few. surge hospital admissions funerals. Certainly, could still happen, least time being, combination habitual mask use, social distance well ventilated buildings (plus knows many other, yet un-assessed factors) seems effective. July 14th? Wtf take PPE want coworkers mask correctly. Ducey acted like lot governors. Instead looking previous data, extrapolating see data might future take mitigating steps, waited problem got hand. look data, again, things got hand, decided enact mask policy. time, late.

It seems like needed actually see people die order believe people die. right. it‚Äôs naive imagine normal anytime soon without vaccine. sorry break  sure administration holding daily planning meetings disaster scenarios stockpiled appropriate resources.

I full confidence CDC, FEMA president handle scenario class, compassion, utmost urgency.

/s don‚Äôt understand legal? simply don‚Äôt understand. really bad. It‚Äôs bad feels fake. miss basic political drama. simply can‚Äôt handle type fucking black mirror episode. was. Could backlog cases reported caused spike. fine. Everything's fine. 

Just bunch asymptomatic young folk nothing see. dad came home Vietnam. brought along alot goods Vietnam wondering worried. used mask came home looked little tired (dont think sick, jetlag). Im worried things brought him. say WTF! BEFORE?! elderly high risk person told ""it's legal protest!""  I'm white. support protests equality. care protests haircuts. I've lot biking. Don‚Äôt worry, won‚Äôt. soon practice kids start testing positive shut down. house paaaacked.

ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üò¨ NY similar order sure one though. 

Good luck! Shoes health conditions. Sure.  effective immediately? shut Spanish Flu. basically rode wave (thus many dead). actions taking flatten curve mean less trouble now, later, unless vaccine arrives first. I'm glad extended border closure again. wait last minute time either, went *fuuuuck that.* worry, hurricanes typically come later season. supposed average season too! Y‚Äôall bunch jerkoffs came say beat it. 
Also looked like employees store; even guy posted door instructions let weren‚Äôt masked wearing tucked chin!  be, take bank. I'm 20s hunkered selfish people like you. choice teachers staff get? want keep kids home bring virus home cant keep kids home they‚Äôre forced teach person? pppfffttt...another sheep buying myth ""molecules"" exist. they're real come I've never seen one!!!!??? (it's truly heartbreaking add /s, since entirely possible see argument wild) also total disaster NYC care homes skews upwards again, maybe that‚Äôs inevitable degree can‚Äôt reasonably adjust IFR based this. said (and people seemed ignore downvote), I‚Äôm trying downplay fundamentally disagreeing anything say, pointing challenges involved. I‚Äôm even sure much useful metric IFR even moment... like 1.5%... 1.5% who? won‚Äôt shut downs. aren‚Äôt worth point probably won‚Äôt make much difference. Hospitals Texas Florida overwhelmed regardless. Assholes like reason trumps gonna win easily....again. Found Kenneth Copeland right boys, pack up! Covid over!!! see literally everyday eyes 90 percent population could care less social distancing even now. dead concept. know. enjoy calling people bullshit. Especially since there‚Äôs much that‚Äôs legitimately dangerous virus. people seem weird psychosexual attraction destruction. easy say Gov Ducey made egregious mistakes. look states data, infection rates, hospitalizations deaths, Voila! Like magic Arizona appears top per capita versus states majority key data points. we‚Äôre calling group. *look yoga mat bushes, herd managers grazes unaware Covid Karen‚Äôs surrounding them.* Yes. I'm genuine. feel would deserve it. I'm hones.t would shitty thing did. would held accountable Good point. agree.. taking quarantine pretty serious. time home gf. went work 3-4 times various reasons usually people opposite sides office.

I finally reached breaking point wanted see friends agreed dinner couple hung outside house little bit distance masks eating fantastic. It‚Äôs nice nice face face conversation someone close to. Beastie Boys wrote song parody. hated people took song endorsement reckless stupidity. Thank saving click. freaked Get stage! suck! *multiple* reports inflated positives mishandled tests current system.

Are questioning current numbers too? MaH fReEdOmS tHo üòÇüòÇ Hopefully never happens national world data raw daily data per country manipulate yourself. positivity rate higher children doesn‚Äôt mean proportionally children infected adults. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs anything meaningful say information. proportion children getting tested? proportion getting tested symptomatic? War Reality going thousands years now.

It's recently become far easier definitively determine reality actually is, thus deniers said reality specific targets. person really gotten quite predicament. unbelievable read every. single. day. workers protected virus. damn, truth right there. glad ya got find personal responsibility attractive \-my mom, yes. üôÑ I'm hour outside PGH seriously hope companies enacting mask requirements stand call police customers trespassing refuse comply. go ask wear mask, anything putting one least saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt one, get one‚Äù result trespassing charges self entitled assholes stop fucking around public health safety. mean it‚Äôs valid fear happen. mean schools. preparing months? reason cited governor - need time prep buy supplies.

He ZOMBIE! wear mask get take off.

Walmart employees Androids, they're people hired communities churning anti maskers. give fuck reddit username? someone gonna skip phases..... and? Wont happen. work frys AZ Kroger division hire security store everyone whatever want us employees engage anyone wearing mask fear retailiation. (Also lost hazard pay since may company like üôàüôàüôàüôà) breaks like 3 subs rules. Come man  gonna lie, Menards mandates masks back stood section entrance watch people complain. entertaining. middle state? He's PGH.  Wearing mask hardship. would like want COVID go work? Get food/medication?

You're extremely selfish Real possibility considering many stupid people exist world. I'll take chances continue stand others. dumb understand everything. english poor... Maybe smart person make summary overview? I‚Äôm pissed hopeful speculation kid‚Äôs maybe able contract spread virus.

Has ever disease history human race children alone immune to?

There figures kids less likely die virus. would obvious considering vast majority children health issues would exacerbate case virus.

That NOTHING less likely contract spread th virus. best comtract spread rate adults, kids take masks, put fingers mouths touch constantly. automatically assumed MUCH likely contract spread virus. therapeutics mind hospital use patients bad shape everyone else....We still dont anything solid yet rest us....which disturbing. Awwwwwwwww yeah!!! closed one main entrances (to make sure everyone comes mask) I‚Äôm guy stands outside closed entrance tells like 50% people go farther one. 

I usually get told ‚ÄúWTF?!‚Äù ‚ÄúAre serious?!‚Äù ‚ÄúBullshit‚Äù ‚ÄúcAN gO DoORs eXiT?? No, they‚Äôre closed ma‚Äôm/sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shopping ever again.‚Äù nothing they‚Äôve reported vaccines false? They‚Äôre keeping public updated developed. sentiment same: goes well, vaccine November. That‚Äôs literally they‚Äôve saying entire time.  OSHA clearly states employers must provide employees working environment free known dangers. keep talking risk reduction, risk elimination. environment safe.
Edit: googling found OSHA (being federal agency) cover public sector employees, like teachers. Says lot teachers‚Äô occupational safety health matter country suppose. experiment got results. saying publish results? may well people simply bandwidth adapt new circumstances that's something take account. really good point. probably much important disaster like too, drawn long unlike many disasters hurricanes 9-11 much faster. I'm NJ definitely felt heroic stage hit hard. Everyone came together supporting even that's gone now. really needed leadership focused keeping people heroic stage longer, instead US got exact opposite. Check indeed periodically work-from-home jobs. one eBay customer support recently area Texas started $16 hour. tempted... sounds familiar... responsible reported boss last month mask reasons since added form refusing buy bleach ever again..anyway month ago nothing came it. messed up. Guess crazy people places. simply get tested again, case, right? Or, wait... it‚Äôs guarantee anything. multiple vaccine candidates world lots show promising results, like CanSino‚Äôs BioNTech‚Äôs anti masker gun gonna cause problems. Walmart already another anti masker gun problem today. Cus easy far? *sigh* it‚Äôs pushing believe California get probably lot deaths corona. Nyc got there‚Äôs done really fast also wasn‚Äôt enough medical knowledge virus might make number bad don‚Äôt think lockdown going change it. didn‚Äôt work first time clearly  doesn‚Äôt mean 31% children positive. without age range, statement like lacks sufficient granularity nuance. There‚Äôs big difference 7 year old 17 year old. think I'm generous say least. Dany's ultimate alliance army gets completely fucked inside 3 episodes, Tyrion can't strategize shit, rushed entire plot, oh wait that's right rushed plot Star Wars movie. mention Invisible fleet Euron appears nowhere whatever reason people can't see late late decimates them, he's able track ship even dead night makes fuckin sense. whole point going north wall one white walker made sense, attack high garden made sense. thing actually made sense fact greedy little shithead writers phasing onto new project put GOT, also makes sense considering show point eclipsed books. Bruh would half million dead point percentage rate. ....are announcing success already phase 3? would mean done.

Edit: looks like data first trial shared tomorrow. Cool look Spanish Flu 100 years ago. Strangely amount people denying use masks.

Strange history repeats people like fight hard argue common sense experts beyond experience knowledge. lol shit problem! 3 parents chosen thst want kid person. Add it, parents working staying home kids arent option. daycare school grandparents house (which one mine 15 plus kids at). Petition nose amendment. Cover damn nose. thankful Governor Wolf here. previous Republican governor Tom Corbett won, would Florida two months ago.  Connecticut far know, still one lowest numbers country. work Walmart I‚Äôm excited get assaulted. I‚Äôm door greeter. put lot words. keep simple. countries doing. Shit drop levels way down. contact trace new cases go normal life masks. past contact tracing takes 15-20 calls per confirmed case still testing. national plan would saved us this. one ever called year long shit down. explain people willing give money (and power) somebody use them. hard concept republicans, the're used vote interests. Hopefully USA. mean... THINKS he's hero America. THINKS best thing ever happened country. 

Obviously want go whole [no thing selfless right everything himself.

But maintain still thinks right thing country lot people believe too. also think people could stop acting kind outrage thrives got elected first place. (As guys here) people side might actually listen might actually take away power.

But guess playing pissing match game better idea. Let know works us November. I'm sure valuable right get office. think switched narratives, pushing two opposite narratives time. immigration: immigrants came take jobs &amp; want work suck system. know works. He's got creepy painting attic absorbs downvotes him.  multiple vaccine candidates works! One vaccine Imperial College wants reach everyone world matter country‚Äôs GDP! Refer comment post. That's good point. feel vaguely claustro take immediately get outside never considered that. says science political. Every day there's biased research paper released. totally get Voltaire said: Common sense common. Pedantic motherfuckers Selfish stupid /r/iamveryignorant UK here, got son tested results back 13 hours. bad Nazis thought socialists Let us forget truckbros camo vests let anyone outside talk radio tell do. mask washable? think find anyone disagrees good solution us parents kids anyone. said multiple friends teachers, paras school staff quite excited get back classroom. They're scared worried. going happen... suggest it, let people without masks. There's consequences wearing one. police county already made statement saying anything enforce mask wearing.. Yeah, family lives Ohio situation ground pretty bad. Almost mask compliance are. lot covid-truthers. immune-compromised relatives afraid. don‚Äôt envy nursing home directors. easy decisions make.

I imagine isn‚Äôt easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. 

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can‚Äôt help care like usually do, volunteers aren‚Äôt allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don‚Äôt anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don‚Äôt even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

The highest risk also negatively effected shutdowns. may buried posts comments elsewhere can't find answer - hospitals 
 longer reporting data CDC way fact check release public? data irrelevant case counts, percentages, hospital utilization, etc.? effort distort CDC gets? Yes. university announced first semester lessons held online.

Honestly hoped could get back class, considering we've 0 new cases week region (in Italy), guess health priority be. Still, baffles i'm reading US open schools month so, really hope government/governors realize serious situation is. no, I'm pretending exist. live area extremely privileged people, get it. country monopoly privilege. white man (blonde hair, blue eyes stands crowd white guy), else outside teach children labeling generalizations bad thing? viscous circle.  stop somehow? vote Congress allow this? Stocks disconnected economic reality


Like 20 percent people danger evictions UI ends end July millions 

It‚Äôs casino hedge funders Costa Rica first region reopen months closure? big influx returning citizens, residents, semi-permenant tourists wanting escape US hotpots could killer. propensity group people choose 1 sport another all... /s bussing kids there? aren‚Äôt allowing everyone flood gates. made options educated assumption would relatively equal spread terms divide. 

I think it‚Äôs responsible. students pushed back online semesters demanded classes held restrictions person. Colleges responding demand accordingly. It‚Äôs black white issue here. Students return campus accord things open school held, smaller class sizes mask wearing mitigate risks. time mitigate risk. choose stay home it, don‚Äôt think right holier thou attitude students chose accept risks attend classes. lol That's awesome, deserve far more. Retail blows Rodney McMullen, CEO Kroger ended $2/hr hero pay despite Kroger posting record profits McMullen receiving significant pay raise total $14.5 million year. Kroger also lost 72 employees COVID, many making minimum wage. Let sink Let open. Even allow 100% capacity one condition. Everyone wear PPE keep atleast 8 hrs. Experience health care workers go every day see still want party. even better, stream hospital/ER cameras TVs enjoy beer. dont want economy close refuse wear mask... problem. oxygen theft capital crime. never really free herpes. Let‚Äôs boarding school instead. don‚Äôt want little germ sacks bringing home garbage. quarantine healthiest kids since started school! basically 0 faith anything cdc directs us do, makes perfect sense wear masks there‚Äôs tons evidence support it. honest fear us continue cases deaths basically run course wish optimistic MAY?!??? shit Congrats quitting! That's great. Got start time. Might well time manage. 
Quote: Ireally socialized very, very, long time


That's......not good. Could things outdoors? impossible safe others takes effort, essential folks like guys NEED interact (and understand). Get gloves masks head park meet friend. 
Hell, could FaceTime cooking high kite someone same. Lol.

Take care yourself. time winter. 

We cannot throw families streets. can't let happen. canadian say right, we're somewhere US Japan. royally screwed LTC homes start (80% 8k deaths came LTC homes I'm mistaken). royally screwed mandating masks (something literally week). But, that, things right.

We also bunch people follow rules, numbers seem much smaller US. implemented fines helped bit.

We're reopening schools fall crapshoot going go (our spread low point; 300 cases day, nationwide). country seem right path now... moment see uptick spread, we'll clamp start shutting vectors spread.

Basically 3 phases... ranging lockdown fully open. We're moving phase 3 (fully open) end week. spread increases, roll back phase 2. enough, back phase 1.

But hopefully mandated mask usage, we'll like Japan moving forward. would correlate intelligence heap piles cash. would make happier da basement. Uh, well, plenty, namely stuff ‚Äúwhat seems working...‚Äù paragraph.

We hundreds pounds reagents, tubes, etc stockpiles, make VTM, personnel surged 500%, we‚Äôve bought four new rtPCR machines pioneered multiplex testing scheme would take us 21 tests every 10 minutes 93.

""Dr. Fauci warned Georgia would see surge coronavirus cases deaths opening economy early.

Georgia broke infections records week (twice) 7 day average dwarfs June numbers. straight lie. live, services, di people take home enough buy house, two cars three guns? Americans (aside young ones big cities) can,

Good, No. passed opportunity good March. life didn‚Äôt get flu shot ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healthy never get flu‚Äù. Then, nephew born realized I‚Äôm really getting flu shot myself, I‚Äôm getting vulnerable people society cannot get vaccinated worse repercussions get flu. last 5-6 years, get flu shot everyone else. 

I glad deciding get flu shot hope continue get flu shot annually. people legit medical conditions infants young vaccination obviously exception get shot. Religious exemptions place society reason get vaccinated. Hey worries all! crossed mind. Murca, ok?... I'm realizing zombie movie pro-zombie group believes bites harmless, idea contrary fake news, realistic.

In zombie apocalypse, least ten percent population going running *towards* zombies.... fucking infuriates isn‚Äôt hard understand! stay home, go must, wear mask. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs takes general populace make go away long enough make vaccine. 

But no. Let‚Äôs reopen schools. Restaurants. Barber shops. Let‚Äôs put children elderly danger. /s

I cannot fathom people thinking, truly. Cook em til covid free! technically accurate takes stance people covid binary response infection: die recover 100%. case studies along recovered accounts showing quite frequently long term damage. Thus, 65 older likely die, it‚Äôs still dangerous younger people. Additionally, you‚Äôre likely die chronic health problems, disease *is causing chronic health problems.* increases likelihood people infected covid die flu (and admittedly don‚Äôt evidence it‚Äôs purely speculation) could likely die suffer second infection virus recovering. isn‚Äôt black white you‚Äôre making be.  wish. could get it.

But US citizens qualify. Unfortunately. anybody going talk COVID death rates??? media sure hell won‚Äôt. Everytime Florida idea opposite wear mask weeks, instead killing hundreds thousands people ""right"" wear mask public. 


can tell wearing mask pandemic mentioned? like think infection.. Oh posted wrong article link huff needs removed. mean there, people all
had masks noses. one leaving chin nose. lot places require masks don‚Äôt enforce it‚Äôs worn. People get sloppy. strange see store full people wore correctly across board. two hours (it like blue moon Costco run). Saw one wearing incorrectly. sure fluke. Still trust stop testing inject self bleach boy. He's saying plenty PPE saying response pandemic probably quite different you‚Äôre one big cities. love Menards. better selection US made tools products. Can't beat 11% rebates large purchases make. real stupid here. Wrong, actually. Sure. replying somebody evaluating reported cases. Stay home, get fired...then lawyer up. There's pandemic going around, bet Shark know get point across employer. see this? Never trust anyone wears big floral scarf Russia vaccines sold packaged, administered spot care lawsuits liability. going trust person read daily briefing save lives thousands. We're really dead. Totally. absolutely think kids option return campus. still think classes in-person. Yeah sure, blinding negative everything healthy. Thats okay. people might get upset throw tantrum certainly wont burn targets destroy public property like demofats Toronto 4th largest city North America Mexico City, New York Los Angeles. Also, we've *more* deaths covid past couple months flu takes year. Search house take away guns. lose right fucking life. didn‚Äôt make comment, different person. Calm down.

And honest, masks social distancing make normal life come back sooner. don‚Äôt realize now, stubbornness defiance likely cause eventually get sick anyway, continue spread it, means we‚Äôll sitting arguing longer shutting big events people attitude adapt. changes, keep yelling people sports concerts still aren‚Äôt happening. 

Sorry, know that‚Äôs want hear that‚Äôs reality we‚Äôre stuck better options come along. Hold onto butts. work subway inside walmart I'm hoping get close dining room rule implemented Desperate words man desperate pull mess shitter stands chance getting reelected. could handled pandemic properly (by basically stepping aside letting medical experts make decisions) ridden good performance victory. could probably erased bad feelings toward done right. squandered opportunity handlers a) short sighted b) eager chance show yet division c) combination above.

I wonder realizes political capital squandered searching way capitalize what's left.  

The logic displayed quote put childlike. 'Well, six cookies Mom says split whatever half Timmy, hide four cookies give Timmy one!' Japan: ~47,000,000 people 200 cases; .00000425 per 

The 200 cases Tokyo (population roughly 14M), whole Japan.

So math would closer 0.0000143.

Regardless, favor severity treated given exponential spread works. guess missed memo decided ditch America. Well covid, go gym? interesting trajectory deaths changed recently. interesting comparisons:

New Jersey - hit 100 deaths day 4/1. week later tripled 310 day

Massachusetts - 4/14 hit 100 deaths first time. 4/22 doubled 221.

New York - 3/24 157 deaths. Seven days later hit 500+ day.

Arizona - 117 deaths 7/7. Eight days later yet break 100 again

Texas - 121 deaths 7/8. Seven days later things increased slightly

Let clear - believe things continue get worse, appears taking different path before. Probably younger demographic impact this. Thank reply fucking sense. Arguably 4 months late, good step lieu semblance leadership federal government. nobody followed instructions.... wanted links. damn time! hope use excuse end free curbside pickup. I've loving past months.  Weinstein went Rogan show suggests man made. obviously far reaching show, know conspiracy theorists everywhere, something conspiracy, make false. know governments shady stuff. 

That said, I've trusting CDC. pro mask. wanna open schools Aug. would like input someone knowledgeable myself. Bret bring meaningful points here? seems like pretty smart guy, shit's head. 

Thanks. standards taddddddd bit higher whatever fuck Russia 5% people contract coronavirus die it, though- reported cases. Yeah store indication, won‚Äôt actually turn anyone away ‚Äúavoid altercations‚Äù instead hang many signs. point, theyll discount wearing mask store anti-mask folks start wearing one I'm northeast tons masks pulled nose mouth Anti-maskers selfish fucks!
If part solution, part problem! Lol end one lady‚Äôs segment ... goes ‚ÄúYou trusted us‚Äù sort disclaimer stating responsibility lies within viewer guarantee people wearing masks get vaccine hoax. explaining parents already forced work risk lives daily translate 'teachers lives matter'? 

Do parent's lives matter? people working grocery stores entire time matter? essential employees lives meaningless? Read room. Bullshit. Lowe's social distancing signs back April. Sure he's running country. don‚Äôt bachelor‚Äôs associates, programs available bachelor‚Äôs first? Saskatchewan (1.1M population) we‚Äôve bars open 5 weeks. 1000 total cases, 100 active cases, 15 total deaths. We‚Äôre far best province well. 

Manitoba (1.4M Population) bars open since June 1 330 cases, 5 active cases, 7 deaths. 

Alberta (4.4M) bars open since May 14. 8900 cases, 700 active, 163 total deaths. 

BC (5.1M) bars open since May 19. 3100 cases, 200 active, 189 total deaths. 


In summary, 12 million people, 374 deaths, bars open places month. Deaths rising. guess main takeaway life go long you‚Äôre pants-on-head idiotic. live conservative province (2nd depending ask) even it‚Äôs political statement wear/not wear mask. 

I don‚Äôt want rude, say word every Canadian spoken America pandemic ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù. see grave injustice succumbing Covid19 called ""weak"" afterwards happening. knew *that.* Like California--most coastal cities Democratic, (except OC) everything inland leans Republican. surprised. internal management memo Health Ambassador escalates non-compliant customer management via walkie communication, member management - Retrieve box GNFR-supplied - Approach customer greet - Remind customer face covering required shopping store ask would like complimentary -If customer agrees wear mask, let take one customer refuses wear mask, let continue shop.** Wow! Like understand, middle pandemic? seems 3-4 months late Ah cool see understand, care about, Canada US' integrated economies.

Keep ah keeping ... guess. Cool beans...  Congrats, Arizona number one!  sounds like bad idea. 

The vacation real estate part today appears lasting Original comment ‚Äúyou refuse entry private business‚Äù, where‚Äôs Canada part? Oh right, you‚Äôre moron. I‚Äôm done responding child get pathetic last word now. Enjoy false sense victory! want sit watch everyone lose minds. going incredible. hell huffing puffing indoors? thats Covid buffet words nyt, me. Teachers integral economy air traffic controllers comes politicians. Teachers literally affects parents ability work, kids. know happens mass fire bunch teachers field already grossly underfunded ? get complete chaos lot angry PARENTS demanding teachers. Teachers influence politicians air traffic controllers precisely job affects everyone else ability work etc. think picked bad candidate, Biden slight advantage Hillary Clinton, Biden outright hated nearly many people Clinton is/was. Hillary Clinton quite hated lot people since early 90's.

Also, certain percentage people would probably never vote woman principle.  Fort Bend said won‚Äôt reopen. imagine lot places won‚Äôt listen governor, much like hospitals disregarding order suspend elective procedures Yeah. think would done back opened even shut?

Seems awfully 11 th hour them. Lol attention? I've observed experience different, different. could easily assume lying, spread Hillsborough pretty bad, everyone best behavior, numbers indicating that. fact, read article claimed restaurants packing people in, selling mostly alcohol get around bar ban, thats right Tampa. dont see issues things going on, downvote gtfo, reason lie north east conservative area absolutely happening. town max, half people stores wearing mask, stores enforce it. 

I'm sure liberal areas pretty good so, even mask mandated state, people businesses following them. Class action lawsuit. punishment spreading Fake News like fox Hospital intensive care units 48 Florida hospitals reached capacity July 10, according data Florida Agency Healthcare Administration. 

The hospitals 0 percent adult bed availability ICUs spread across 26 counties. Statewide, 14.4 percent adult ICU beds available July 10. 

Below 48 hospitals reported ICUs capacity, according data updated 6:46 a.m. CDT July 10. Hospitals listed alphabetical order accompanied adult ICU census. 

[actual hospital bed shortage  well said.

maybe segregate mask non mask. survey non maskers. fair, *ton* cases TX new last couple weeks, deaths even come yet, I'm sure many come latest cases. I'm still seeing could 14k deaths 6k people normal died total. We're claiming hid bodies something right?

Say 70:30 ratio wearing masks day went inacceptable....shit man. Since I‚Äôm trapped US, please mail dose. open gym? Pls Yep, heard similar scenarios time time again. Overall tone ""I care, go make money"" look us want work. Idk you, love money bank spend lol. However one year old value life much much dollar. are, suffering, blamed standing ground families healths best interest mind. truly sad world living right now. 

I wish best safety. Stand ground. also expand capacity certain point. Maybe getting 105% 110% hospitals cant maintain capacity resource limitations.  hope Trader Joe‚Äôs every company follows suit. It‚Äôs frustrating companies let states laws dictate mask policy. Protect employees, profits. *Oh yeah cum mask* tonight? Yes, agree you. I've felt along disease far deadly flu, higher impact older individuals lower impact youngest. Virtually every age group find disease deadly, matter multiplier different age group.

That Spanish study sounds good like good science. random, need. young people going spreading homes compromised body systems. here's kicker: complain shutdowns they're ones responsible everything happening California. people beyond selfish. work fairly young (19-23 year old) staff. number times seen wear masks chin guards pull talk ridiculous. gently point proper mask usage them, laugh refuse pull nose. frustrating especially least three staff members go get tested last week. No, large community spread LOCK DOWN. Assume every household infected. Then, maybe month, probably two, situation rapid testing return normal case several countries Europe. no, isolated ones. Plenty international traffic/tourism. screaming worst expect. Tbh I'm waiting available private clinics Kaliningrad, visa-free EU citizens Cool story. Bye now. means willing lie us ""for greater good"". That's unacceptable, bring suspect anything else (or CDC) might say. Home depot near requiring masks past 3 months least. Lowes, much. demand right harm others. That's bioterrorists demanding.  want country. I'm sick tired Americans' selfishness. Oh, stupidity too. know right. Covid Karens watch CNN listen Fauxci pretend high mighty incorrectly wear mask "" care people"" assault people wearing one. Despite fact never worn one single time even though immuno compromised people would killing would also get really sick die flu. covid karens drive around wearing precious mask alone car cut people traffic.   Sure can. love sports, wouldn‚Äôt require athletes play dangerous environment. certainly don‚Äôt need expose environment involves fans. TV. What‚Äôs going suck fact sports teams figure financing works going forward stadium revenue less physical merchandise sold. reasonable accommodations given date allow pass without word subject so... due giving proper protocols safety measures? I‚Äôm pretty sure that, Americans concerned ‚Äúfreedom breathe fresh air‚Äù decided ignore safety measures. sure, blame all. Definitely real person charge, president. seems abundance anti-intellectualism world US particular. Many wear proudly badge honor. It‚Äôs sad infuriating. hard - see people rip masks exiting stores even get door - people walking parking lots bothering mask people right next them. can't even police stuff know wrong. Feel better! memory hole can't get customers dress like slobs think people wear masks? Yeah right I'm waiting someone buy gun Walmart shoot it... actual response? Ok, case closed. Unfortunately Floridians stay Florida. problem problem world‚Äôs problem. got sick Sunday afternoon, got test Monday negative (but symptoms still here)...does anyone know chances negative positive?

Thank advance help. Anything Wolf says. sent thousands covid patients nursing homes cries medical experts caused thousands deaths. u.s, Nov 4? Better figure shit flu season hits months. arent actually enforcing big box retailers. refuse wont anything. bullshit. see spike cases Arizona, that's today, that's samples tested today, collected ago. worse now. means please serve us rebuttal handled well. We're ears. Yeah, feeling too. I'm American Guatemala planning open airport Aug 15th. Whatever happens CR, hopefully Guatemala learns improved 2.0 opening. think likely similar demographics travelers open. Thanks posting every day. think I've ever responded one posts read numbers every day post them.

I seem recall CR quite well couple months ago. much now. ‚òπÔ∏è  dark dimension here: high levels COVID circulating US right prove helpful trials trying assess effectiveness. horrific reality would never, ever hope for, silver lining members trial much likely exposed virus virus stamped out, helping get data sooner effectiveness. I'm sure financially supportive, conscious company like Wal-Mart taken opportunity prepare staff customers would issue this. see problem whatsoever. fact think worked, paid customer service supervisor, along staff would happy meet customers front store help coordinate safe shopping customers. Thank goodness Wal-Mart thinking customers staff pandemic. takes lot guts this. /s read entire chain want say, holy shit stupid. ü§£ Even 6 masks PPE. least protecting others 6 times better surgical masks tight enough seal function respirators. there's silver lining gleaned this, people actually dying anti-science hill (comparably) low mortality rate virus serve teachable moment next one, might *much* deadlier prognosis. sad takes harsh lesson humanity avoid even worse one. Actually, accurate. 

The LEL meter breathing, there's intake oxygen brought filter outside. Assuming normal type designed suck air strength would change air's composition. lungs exactly that. 

90% oxygen breathe in, put lungs anyway. might fired Trump. Fauci fired taking virus. doctor! Let‚Äôs hope Oxford moderna breakthrough actually stranger that, although agree - U.S. invested $600 million Oxford vac gave Moderna. 

But, oh yeah, co-director Operation Warp Speed heavily invested Moderna... silly me. [Socially. Nytimes article since many hhaving trouble mean doubt they‚Äôre going starve Affected; they're Florida Man Strikes Again!  link specific instance someone denied entry wearing mask? something old. Something pandemic. 

I'm ignoring anything. shown something actually happened. I'm glad Walmart requiring mask reading comments people going freak insane. people freak out, will, feels like overrun morons. hate Reddit that's do. people mentally ill absolutely help them. Hate, justified, solution. keep hating Karen's whatever group choose isolate next destined become thing hated begin with. feel like point forcing people wear mask, nobody COVERS FUCKING NOSES! context link pls? told Facebook day must liberal supports pedophilia said masks important. Come'on Desantis. need step game. wonder increase percentage population gets it. imagine many scared needles shy away. made obvious. disappointed surprised. fair, masks tubes hard find nowadays. think defecting Canada say F.U fat orange lunacy sponge. 6-10 days according CVS site. got one last Thursday still waiting results.

But amongst shouting sides (I unsafe person schooling), think it‚Äôs lost intrinsic part society/economy/social well being, rapidly heading towards cliff.

If risk, teachers, medical professional could get vaccinated first could actually see situation US stabilizing quickly. example - remember videos people applauding health care workers shift change NYC Seattle, think. Lately I've seen several stories overwhelmed hospitals Houston, Arizona Florida yet none sentiment - really even comments sub.  

I think heroic stage probably ended maximum community cohesion protests. inevitable would large widespread around country time - neither good bad, is. different circumstances energy might stayed pandemic. we're another phase. ""Astrazeneca agreed supply 100 million doses Oxford vaccine UK delivery September October manufacturing plans well way. also plans supply US 300 million doses time. far secured global manufacturing capacity two billion doses. ""

Sorry. Yeah N95 masks healthcare professionals. people want COVID go work? starve selfish? Apparently really shape bad health since claim able breathe 30 seconds probably drama llamas. Lol Exactly. thought degree Communications would make readily able help fix problem.

Instead made depressed yell lemmings hurdling cliff, can't physically stop them. Educational assistance when....  1:1 setting. kids getting services getting 1:1 zoom me. Working specifically goals. common sense call never result due process issue. doubt anything change. towns require masks, people still go shopping without them. one enforces it.

RemindME! 2.5 months could seen Darwinism certain extent. False. relying disinformation meant spread fear. actual numbers LESS seasonal flu. transmission rate higher, nothing like media claimed. 

Use critical thinking metrics mean something. saying people car accidents died covid, numbers skewed TRYING make is. 

Follow money get truth. Look Fauci Gates invested in, question narrative. seems profit vaccine? true evil world unimaginable. psychological barrier people believe it. get it, see world really works. Instead pay raises retailers offering drink coupons half local bar grill. could never seen this... friend, brought many lulz. CO2 build also happens exercise, really problem. wore N95 mask local hospital, ascended flights stairs fine. You‚Äôre acting like child. never endorsed study. simply put asked people‚Äôs thoughts. need act pretentious :( I'm pretty sure apparently announcing peer-reviewed results phase 1 


Hopefully I'm wrong People color literally targeted obscuring face. White people generally assume person color covers face committing crime. ignoring stories people color cannot wear face coverings without targeted law enforcement? purposefully ignoring racism? Grocery stores protect us many state, county, city governments. spent way much time arguing yesterday said ‚Äúthere ton evidence masks dangerous‚Äù

ITT: Children unable discuss topic due guy's name. idiots look stupid wearing mask ""fight virus"" dangerous normal flu.

The rate infection death rate virus lot worse normal ppl hiding everything weakening immune systems point common cold gonna kill soon!

You idea immune system works you? Wearing mask going weaken immune taint taste good you?

I see another person thinks every single professional part conspiracy deceive them. also forgetting one government. Governments world telling people wear youre old preeixisting conditions fine

Usually, yes always case. Even fine symptoms, wearing mask reduces chance spreading vulnerable groups lot. hospitals places pretty empty. ever happened ""flattening curve?"" flatlined now.

If flatlined, rate infection mortality rate increasing. flatlined now. cases testing, mortality rates stayed roughly dropped. 

No flatlined while. still increasing. cases testing shows pandemic even worse. Mortality rates stayed roughly dropped. still increasing. live NY democrat governors killing bunch old ppl putting covid ppl nursing homes w/ non-covid ppl, location's overall mortality rate changed much prior years...

This happening NY. Anyway, many locations mortality rate increase due covid ""deaths"" also normal deaths ppl happen w/ covid covid two entirely different things.... understanding causation hard ppl apparently

Most covid deaths normal deaths. hard medical professionals tell someone died covid not.

 amount people dying covid lot higher amount people died covid (almost 140k). Clearly understand idea ""correlation ‚â† causation"" properly. means correlation ALWAYS equal causation, NEVER does.

Also superiority complex showing, especially last sentence. true! disgusting Government officials find within hours everyone else wait days, weeks. DISGUSTING!! respect opinion, also beef return. (I'm venison person anyway)

If may ask, mean say ""follow through""? Imagine vaccine made soon, yet enough Americans refuse get herd immunity. doubt that's possible maybe communities. trap priced in. Well im scientist, try sneezing open, try sneezing piece cloth face, see one messier French murdering lot bus drivers lately something one murder reposted every day? Dick Pound kick ass porno name. coronavirus eventually die due enough people immune time. nearly 100 cases county, 66 active, six probably. don‚Äôt hospital. rely neighboring hospital, 22 ventilators available, 11 ICU beds. can‚Äôt wait kindergartener learn self-sufficiency. Online classes don‚Äôt work everyone. 

I excited older kids online options. right may hold littlest one back rather subject Zoom Kindergarten. Google Israel school opening disaster. 
They still recovered that. 50% drop public transit usage *huge* measure. Sure, many places more, big drop society-altering event matter look it. honestly blame game failure every level. Im MLS student. Graduate 3 weeks. started clinical rotation lab clinical trials. supervisors instructing employees please wear mask clinical trial participants get scared. medical professionals I'm talking here. Everyone responsible part stop this. president literally everyone. 

Fuck Trump ok. he's going anywhere anything. need focus things fix like speaking local business owners require masks. Walmart require masks starting monday. take fucking long. Sorry, rant over. Turned cdc machines off?

Elaborate sources? 

Please thanks. don‚Äôt approach people. don‚Äôt sneeze people. don‚Äôt lick people. considerate others. I‚Äôm also sick, don‚Äôt covid19, I‚Äôm concerned getting it. body, choice. Telling body selfish. 

Some parents scared schools can‚Äôt open? sounds like parents selfish. Edie silly considering data says kids 18 aren‚Äôt substantial risk covid19 ‚Äúexperts‚Äù agree opening schools vital. thought supposed ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù ‚Äútrust doctors‚Äù? Trump using DeSantis playbook. Florida started messing data backfired. 

He uses misdirection confusion like Russians. Republican party traitors shamed public. That's great idea, well versed dealing idiots. Someone promote man!  I'll believe see it. Masks mandatory Salt Lake City already, probably 1/3 people Smith's (our Kroger outlet) without masks yesterday. think local management takes stuff seriously.  jail, yet?

In counties Florida, jail healthy place. holding-tank always held every drunk vagrant, recently occupants high virus test positivity rates.

Although additional guy hired wipe carts too. buy Goya black beans??? terrifying. There‚Äôs hope. anybody know information False Positive testing? possibility? Well, glorious leader:

* Sat information potential severity situation literally action weeks
* locking travel China, took almost action month far contact tracing, increasing testing, ramping local medical supply production
* Called hoax organized political opponents tank re-election chances
* left states fight PPE supplies international supply chains predictably broke countries locked supplies.
* Suggested repeatedly months ""just go away""
* Suggested drinking bleach eliminate disease
* Suggested taking potentially harmful (and utterly ineffective fighting covid) medication (oh yeah, owns stake company manufactures it) caused predicted shortages medications lupus patients actually needed it
* utterly refused seen public wearing mask literally past week.
* tied concept wearing mask - basic effective preventative measure available - visible display support politically way guess ""sticking libs""?


His every public appearance since beginning crisis lent anyone actually takes seriously grossly, negligently, dangerously, ignore clear warning presented public health officials. Tens thousands people dead direct result country's inability respond responsible manner situation, specifically personal public performance openly discredit, question, recently publicly attack public health officials way suggest everything perfect.

This happens utter abdication federal leadership, leaving patchwork application state policies disease sees borders - simultaneously generating public discontent among supporters potential solutions politicizing existence disease health officials responses it.

He murdering Americans. may seem inconsequential reusable masks dad made certain smell offputting used mask msde old clothes I'd rather smell nothing/the soup used wash whatever disposable mask, oh also RULES know could go Richard, clearly prefers Dick. Since Kentucky required masks worn retail stores such, Wal-Mart plastered giant sign outside grocery entrance, noticed significantly people wearing masks. Instead 50% wearing I‚Äôd say 85% wearing. I‚Äôm bit surprised actually. It‚Äôs Kentucky all. tried taking charge early quickly denied white house not, way, power tell governors run states.

How so? remember saying would keep governors shutting things down, remember trying actually things stop spread virus getting pushback governors. could mistaken, remember seeing news, bit vague would hard find without knowing specifics. source this? Thanks. never said did. read enough create opinion. Facebook it‚Äôs stream craziness. Yeah, good Varadkar Taoiseach this, it? name countries take Justin Trudeau seriously? mentioned another thread, think give guys full-height, transparent riot shields.

Do times idiots get message. need people shut man they're like roaches Looks like I‚Äôll taking hard earned dollars elsewhere. Seriously. knew movie would turnout documentary? Well, guess we‚Äôll see plays out. Yeah many people (here germany least) always speak 25k number... Vineland NJ Walmart, lot employees lot customers cover noses masks. Wish Costco near me. got kidding. Almost everyone Chicago wear masks. use CTA (train) daily, shop Jewel Osco places, walk miles every day less 1% people meet wearing mask. Yo comment well met sobering. It‚Äôs really poignant you‚Äôre right solidarity. don‚Äôt know anymore. don‚Äôt time  tiny volume inside mask insignificant blood oxygen levels also small concentration gases area changes rapidly every time exhale. people freaking alarms going considering capacity lungs many times space inside mask therefore air breathing coming environment inside mask. air rebreathed. oxygen levels concerned average air inside mask air pulled breath rather oxygen levels mask alone. Six face masks? wish clever enough make strip poker joke I'll end post reiterating love god wear face mask people! ;) that? watching episode today said wears mask time, one pocket, misquoted joking burr.

Nice see nowadays. According scientists vaccines promising better longer lasting immune responses.  get one (rather therapeutics) till next year.  one maybe. mean someone ate $800 dollars worth Bubba Gump stolen edd card :)  you! loud minority (that happen lot power) anti science . boomerest thing I've heard day one lasts years... fault y'all looking data. Pharmacist here. us understood he‚Äôs coming from. public health perspective. Unfortunately miscalculated badly bc human nature unpredictable. said please wear masks please ALSO save PPE healthcare workers bc healthcare workers get sick, you‚Äôre SOL. Hindsight 20/20.

** also even said above, there‚Äôs 50/50 chance people would hoarded masks we‚Äôd still SOL research. rest bit laughable .   far know one clinical studies got intentionally exposed virus still arent results unintentional infections went, would know ADE? Experiments animals dont count.  Yeah day record cases too, right? record deaths. One two. can't keep up. 

They also said kids wear masks day I'm like... good luck that? godkids handle hour start pulling off, complaining, sometimes meltdowns.

Plus health checks beginning day take forever there's constantly going kids sent home coughs symptoms COVID totally indistinguishable allergies colds.

I also love like, oh, close school couple cases. üôÑ 

I'm horrified teachers treated. Kids may recover easily, although may long term damage, teachers staff? That's scary. literally asking put danger death, little reason, money resources make jobs safer.

Plus, good luck finding subs half teachers COVID.

I‚Äôm baffled refuses consider rolling state back previous reopening phases, even one two, help control spread, instead focus creating hospital capacity. essentially, he‚Äôs fine cases exploding damage people families, focus creating hospital space filled happens. feel like that‚Äôs dangerous game play, it‚Äôs leaving many Tennesseans vulnerable position. 

Speaking vulnerable, also spending time, apparently plans spend much state revenue possible according today‚Äôs press conference, fight abortion ban, claims meant protect vulnerable Tennessean lives- elderly immunocompromised?? young middle aged workers could end lifelong complications? vulnerable valuable worth saving? time state monetarily struggling, focus plans spend state revenue? Unbelievable shameful. matter views, time main focus. 

He needs get priorities straight. actually said 9+% positive rate good. Baffled. truly know Americans don‚Äôt full testing, contact tracing, quarantine support services?

Personally, I'm waiting study proves water is, inconclusively, wet. actually think vaccine development going swift, real, effective, economic damage US going hard mitigate point. world trust US tourist investment destination going tank. Ugh. Hopeless. children injured vaccines (I met several)

The odds astronomically low. Much likely met several people incorrectly believe children damaged vaccine. family plan senior stay home first semester. friend also trying convince boyfriend's parents same. Then, 3 get together least week study. still risk one semi-control still allow social interaction.

At quarter-end, we'll assess whether looks like in-school attendance safe. yes she'll go back school 2nd semester.
But, honestly AZ odds shit show. thank Except wear face mask cuz think ""freedom"" taken away.  Educated intelligent always thing, though tend conflate two. think intelligence innate, whereas education obtained. educated people intelligent, lot stupid fucking educated people walking around there. Still logic 100 million doses vaccinate vulnerable elderly. Idk I'm trying see best outcome possible could Sure. thought put there, might change mind. 

* Lol. kidding. anti mask fools can't see beyond noses, let alone think critically enough change minds.* Im one states decreasing.

Good luck America, contained common sense daughter 2 half. goes daycare right wear mask day. told superhero accepted that. favorite Spider Man mask.

It's easy we're making work, bless heart. There's opting one unless build pluming water system well. 

A reverse osmosis water installed next kitchen sink easy way opting this. ""It make sense whatsoever...""

What powerful argument. That's thing though. 

The ""unprecedented focus need vaccine"" ""make likely find safe effective vaccine quickly."" 

It still hope, prayer, dream!

I'm trying downer. I'm sticking science.

As far ""shorter normal phase 3 clinical trials,"" I'm sure necessarily good thing. 

How trials able accomplish this? safe trials took longer determine efficacy? rush due high demand thus pushed heavily vetted? It‚Äôs really odd. Plus said poor man ‚Äúcold‚Äù. long van one checking him? Seems like bit negligence nursing home. *""CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said June 25 ‚Äúthere actually were* [*10 reported case, NPR reported. estimated 5% 8% American population exposed virus, according NPR.*

*Researchers Massachusetts Institute Technology said June 18, around* [*17.5 million *in country coronavirus one point, Business Insider reported.""*

With numbers like that, surprising community spread increasing. CDC needs stronger wording. None ‚Äúcan u guise consider masks pls‚Äù bs. Yeah hire scabs. actually care education, want babysitters people go back work. wrong. Again, read paper, that‚Äôs factually incorrect ‚Äî vast majority side effects described mild.

And think that‚Äôs interesting statement requires bit context fully assess.

Do inactivated vaccines currently use side effect profiles order? No, though certainly similar levels adverse events ‚Äî again, think tetanus booster, notoriously annoying. don‚Äôt recall top head exact numbers quadrivalent HPV, it‚Äôs also pretty damn high terms adverse events, though think nonavalent slightly better tolerated. general though, current NON-LIVE-ATTENUATED vaccines better tolerated novel vaccine.

If guy including live-attenuated vaccines he‚Äôs talking that, that‚Äôs factually incorrect.

*However*, vaccines product many rounds development, first approved vaccines diseases often weren‚Äôt well-tolerated significantly higher levels adverse events. It‚Äôs reasonable compare novel vaccine novel virus nth iteration older vaccines.

Second, even unusually high terms number side effects, *who cares*? Look, fixate ‚Äúoh god 40% got fevers‚Äù without noticing vast majority low-grade fevers *that weren‚Äôt even treated ibuprofen*, that‚Äôs prerogative, nobody half brain going look think it‚Äôs worth prevents COVID-19, unlikely cause much severe fevers even mild cases. god‚Äôs sake, accept live-attenuated viruses cause mild version *actual* disease cases ‚Äî think people running 38 degree fever cause FDA even blink?

This honestly level obstinate ignorance haven‚Äôt experienced Reddit ‚Äî it‚Äôs truly fascinating. assume lockdown. explain methodology. $10k/day fines stupid businesses fines get donated local hospitals crazy. becoming China. Even worse can‚Äôt contain it. fudging data plan Yeah. I‚Äôm also Canadian things look little different US. yeah. I‚Äôm saying ok ‚Äúeveryone go nuts it‚Äôs fluuuuuu‚Äù mentality. think right now, multiple potential vaccines could make difference wait see successful. 

But, event vaccine - eventually get back living. no, doesn‚Äôt mean living 10 person socially distanced bubbles forever, wearing masks every time leave house, etc. Karmao Both, shoot up. Carnival barker Hell pulling bandaid, debriding wound, surgery, suturing up, letting wound heal fully.

Instead it's, ""everything fine, gotta work"" take pain killers trudge on. ok bit pain killers antibiotics. couple months line, pain suddenly unbearable. wound necrotic. Inflamation, pus, sepsis set spread infection organs. cut leg. Hopefully save organs late.

Thats got kicking line procrastinating. couldnt, sensible thing take 2 months off....

Fifty years ago, designed braking system helped reduce fatal car crashes. Mario Palazzetti invented device hopes curb spread Covid-19.

The retired Fiat Research Centre engineer known Mr ABS anti-lock braking system created standard motor vehicles.

At age 84, devised gadget size electric kettle creates local air currents aim stop circulation tiny droplets expelled people speak - potentially hindering spread Covid-19 infections.

""We've called Biostopper used create aerodynamic field, breath someone emits talking comes back them,"" explained.

Palazzetti started work device two months ago, hoping address difficulties social distancing schools, offices, bars restaurants pandemic killed 548,000 people took hold.

He working team Politecnico di Torino (University Turin) fine tune test product.

""I can't tell many technical details still patenting phase,"" Professor Marco Simonetti Politecnico's energy department told Reuters.

""The concept simple, ambition kill virus, reduce distance (between people) safely,"" added.

The Biostopper initially designed allow two people get closer together, Simonetti said could work small groups.

""We concentrating talking, sneezing would need much invasive system,"" said.

The Politecnico team hopes prototype end July go market end summer.

Mr ABS, retired 1997, behind string inventions, including TOTEM (Total Energy Module), small heat power generator, air conditioning system called Aircare also recovers energy.

Let anti vaxxers want. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre drawing conclusion biology we‚Äôve observed far, based observation wouldn‚Äôt expect children high infection rate limited exposure pretty early. things like Disney theme parks open eventually schools, expect we‚Äôll see conclusion reverse.

I mean even keep schools closed, 31% positive, you‚Äôll population ages positive months. 

I mean, doubling positive rate schools closed completely reasonable herd immunity kicks in. 

So really it‚Äôs keep kids catching close schools all? mean, kids aren‚Äôt school staying home. course aren‚Äôt catching often adults. soon change school opens. Pretty bad. Corona around least 10 000 years. human body learned handle mutations well. So, mutation suddenly disappear? Humans learn handle also mutations die. Way friendly interpretation:

Doing together synergistic effect. one time, inefficiently, inconsistently, improperly, basically America it, marginally moving statistical averages.

Gotta Republicans right. That's good information. biggest problem pretty much everywhere locked kids real early (closing daycares schools) globe. think lot kids exposed.

We see short weeks whether early studies findings continue hold US.
 
Also, really can't look information countries expect likewise US response (or lack thereof) unique US.  Hilarious sentiment reality people reading articles minuscule minority. people get info all.

And try saying stupid shit like people living outside super densely populated megacities ""uneducated"" shit like that. people would happily go live country could never afford that, especially us millennials.

Hope Half White America: Hmm, sounds terrible. choice have? can't vote party black people women I? 

Millennials: 1 meme = 1 vote. need vote homies. People know speculated potentially high third. possible virus understood effects could mitigated. example, found covid makes likely blood coagulate hence people getting strokes, heart attacks, random ischemic damage clots. standard many places prescribe anti-coagulate part discharge month two. Many people also reporting long term cognitive effects, early say happen given enough time recover. covid positive sub frankily terrifying. anything feel like damage disease downplayed media since people rationalizing minimizing away saying would get mild case ""healthy"", ""youngish"", ""like totally great immune system"" (whatever means). It‚Äôs distance metropolitan area though, it‚Äôs brainwashing stay mindset. mom rural part Ireland imaginable, it‚Äôs hour drive nearest town still small town, hours nearest city. folks would never visited city entire lives. progressed rest country albeit little slower.

Translation: USA get Corona virus control. Kids allowed back school imagine dont take it. alone push population get like forced vaccines. businesses make required. Hot take Underrated comment right ...it sarcasm. random capitols thing sarcasm. mortality rate coming Trump covid task force like last week. could less 0.1%, right depends many already covid. schools closed nationwide time states barely cases (comparatively) kids social bubbles ever since then. think severely overestimating number kids already covid. I'm sure I'm following examples - disagree 25%-50% US already covid. Maybe Facebook automatically transferred people anti-mask groups (at point assume some) ""in memoriam"" anti-mask group, would start get picture. ""the recent CFR trending 2%"" - that's true all.

I know ""most recent CFR is"", die spend time hospital, people infected died yet avg time infection death 21-28 days.

California counting confirmed Covid deaths, probable. means likely tested, counted, high risk groups. 

It's catch-22. way tested high risk group. way high risk group, tested.

You're also counting open cases. bulk cases young last couple weeks. cases yet met resolution. % diagnosed last 3 weeks, die.

Your math assumes live. not. pointed out, CDC depress true CFR &amp; IFR. include open cases resolved closed case ended recovery. That's wrong. people enthusiasm First Second Amendment anti-lockdown protests going on. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. That‚Äôs possibility, mention countless morons refuse even work. Always reading Corona USA, start wondering nobody USA bothers look countries low fatality rate. best example Singapore claim hunt case. addition, concentrated 300 000 foreign workers dormitories physical distancing possible. remember right, case count inside dormitories 40 000 zero fatalities.

One could even suggest avoiding distancing helps avoid fatalities.

There fatalities outside. number 50.

I live island 3 4 million people less 20 fatalities. 

So, causes huge difference USA? goodness. stupidity.  Also worth noting NBA getting food catered bubble exclusively Fertitta's restaurants. He's clearly getting profits without work. least 2 work today Think it, let‚Äôs say need 200 million people get get herd immunity.

People cough time? about, hear people coughing time. sick stay home. like blist actor president 80s Anecdotal, I'm intelligent. listen way intelligent me; ideally people public health professionals, doctors, epidemiologists. people tell social distance. capitalism works.. kinds cool games fun nieces phone. Even watching tv together fun. I've done adults, too. Pick show movie hang watch want talk others Tell look nz Huh? coming LA County Yeah, story makes think 'negligence part whoever driving van' well.  introvert moved across country job knows absolutely one area friends previous area, 4 months isolation really rough. There‚Äôs many video games play, books read, movies watch, podcasts listen to, projects complete get stir crazy NEED physical social interaction (while wearing mask maintaining 6 foot gap, course). Aw that‚Äôs kinda sweet. Well, we‚Äôre basically fucked people don‚Äôt seem care sooooo..... standard small amount people taking - 

NOT 40%. 

This really bad.

I hope Oxford vaccine pans out, good. Top 1% owns 50% stock market
top 10% owns 92% stock market

When talk stock market recovery (that due 0% interest rate, loose lending policies FED corporations buybacks stay alive), talking top 10-15% Americans. lives great, comfy white collar job work home, watch Netflix, order Uber Eats, watch stock market grow give ""passive income"" form dividends.

The rest America struggling, got $1200 government least. FREEDUMB apply [only mean conservative radio. expect? hate-mongering conspiracy rants. exactly Im afraid going artificially lower death rate Where?  Like states level spiking. 

Here Manitoba Canada pissed went 13 days without case 5 cases today bringing us 5 active cases. thought we‚Äôve known awhile, behind times they? bet they‚Äôre still using 56k modems, probably faxed BNO tweet. Remember CDC said masks anything? Cool. I'm type 1 diabetic. Guess I'll die then. Ditto can't make lemonade lemon stealing whores around Unless woman (but look cool women too, see Ripley Alien 3), try buzzcut. Super easy yourself. I've cutting hair like three years, starting went barber shop closed. decided use beard trimmer cut down, loved easy hair maintain afterwards. use actual hair trimmer.  us born trying escape. Dont wrap us country full people nationalistic point pants head retarded. us trying stay alive idiots play pretend plague. CDC wasnt willing lie cheat administration ? getting downvoted headline attracting people want hear hopeful info rather accurate info. 

The opposite effect happens submissions depressing info, btw. That's reddit works. may right likely so. fact comment reflects well beliefs gives simmer hope. That's what's celebrated. Stop trying start shit there.  Governor DeSantis, you? challenge it. look forward supreme court ruling 2021 2022. Hopefully well vaccine. familiar lagging indicators. waiting lag 4 weeks bump, single US city region nearing Italy day. 

So 3 weeks 60,000 new cases, 250 deaths, reason push another lockdown? like Candice Killer I‚Äôm def gonna stock TP next shopping trip weekend. started thinking could happen again, random luck plenty last time. situation course almost bring entire family casual shopping...normally complete 2-5 hyperactive kids running aisles. smoking something....?
Oh, meant ""you're""! Yeah, ok, zoomer. Masks social distancing work. Quarantine works, requires lot commitment follow-up. think hand-washing good prevent illness every case, it‚Äôs thing mask-wearing. don‚Äôt know places, Chicago area, already becoming trend wear mask work felt weather, well enough work - fever, common cold, infections controlled medication (e.g. Strep throat). imagine this, it‚Äôs going even popular solution. know will!  I‚Äôm Kansas City required wear mask everyone seems wearing one go out! Poor kids paying full price school teaching everything online. mom's family went BS. One siblings even ended divorced end it. mom gave share spent years mediating grievances people would talk again. talking Americans, vile ass woman coughed infant last week it? ü§î. Yes purpose, whole grown ass woman, knows better. Remember people children raising. 

Now saying France? üòÇ also people voted Dump. idea respect is. West Chester fine example affluent, educated, liberal neighborhood, guys always going comply experts' recommendations. ""they wearing masks okay"" responses come weeks in.

...But clearly wearing masks whole time, even see someone explicitly say it. Maybe obvious everyone wore masks feel need point out, like know people store wearing pants even tell are. worth, saw people talking high mask usage protests started. date, cats died ingesting disposable gloves covid. far know one reported cat death worldwide. likely cat contracts okay. Geez, work frontlines hospital change pay took away much matched retirement.  Australias currently getting second wave opened little early. Sure around 3500 cases, could handling better. Currently Prime Minister concerned making money rather health public. He's miniature Trump, even though they're Liberal party. disgusting. Labour's shit though. I'm saying voting Green solution, showing two main parties they're replaceable, get rid whenever want, get shit together. Greens want change much stuff viable option, getting in, think would prove point others. half use already metric. can't get application - data predicated non-mask-wearing risk? came back dental appointment exactly happened there. receptionist customer masks covering mouth nose. Gosh, people inconsiderate. Yup. much regret leaving Oregon home family Texas. family cares risk.... surrounding people suck. Maskless showing trump shirt process. Gross arrogant. Literally wear mask enter store take off. ORDER CURBSIDE ASSHOLE. hate here.

Ones lot wealth international tourism probably got first people travelling infected countries time, places dense populations (large cities) get spread around quickly. I'm sure things New York could done, early US's experience hard control within NYC, I'm surprised got bad.

Meanwhile places taken longer get slower spread people generally packed together rural suburban areas, could leave different places, might never large spike - *unless* start holding mass events people *are* densely packed even handful infected people could (unwittingly) infect hundreds others, on. think Texas might behind likes New York, think NYC would hell lot worse strict shutdowns slow spread. Listen...we can‚Äôt trust CDC trusted predicated science. waffling sources hasn‚Äôt helped. don‚Äôt trust Fox, CNN, MSNBC whoever else reporting agendas country (sorry speaking US).

The extra $600 per month large sum money government consider, focus benefit little bullshit morality war received money think deserve it. change policy politicians mind. Therefore, advocating continuation closest thing UBI we've gotten point economic benefit. requires research economic impact distribution directly citizens, spending time bitching churches also bailed out. alarming side effects small proportion people (like, 1 10,000). 

This 40%.  even literally used WW2-era laws basically nationalize factories yet unbeknownst bureaucracy streamlined, takes months. Best economic system arse lol.

A lot unprofitable companies (Uber, Doordash, Weworks, ect) formed credit economy filled currently. basically evidence stay alive without increasing debt bubble even more. 

Meanwhile, deflation. Savings time high (think deflation relative value money, high savings means money valuable, means deflation), heck Apple $250b parked offshore accounts even know with. Certainly invest create jobs since aggregate demand economy low.

When overall debt economy high, deflation, get called [debt recovery that. money owe getting valuable, need borrow money stay alive. referring Wuhan Institute Virology (mentioned article) hard see making claims is. mean true even accurate understand need hostility. Wonder even thought wearing mask isnt big deal. [I think.they getting counted properly, check excess deaths. Worse shot? sure? Oh, forgot FrEedOm Jeez. anyone tell us before? /s think that's crazy, say widely available. could see ready emergency use US.  HR anything could held liable someone getting sick result actually enforcing policy change. HR's job protect business, employee.

HR needs snap then, employee, caught COVID-19 work company masked employees, I'd sue. Watson, 50, cystic fibrosis deals severely-reduced lung capacity. Still, GTA man says heeding medical advice wearing mask public effort curb spread COVID-19. 

Right, people actually medically risk tend well, know need protection get. Canada, Stephen Harper ""right wing problem' prime minister 2006 till 2015. promised open abortion debate, never did.

I feel like people like don‚Äôt understand immigrants never really met them. vast majority people illegally didn‚Äôt sneak across border circumvent system. legally many years visas expired home left go to. system‚Äôs path citizenship broken. tried get path legal citizenship, couldn‚Äôt, matter hard tried. everyone marry billionaire like Melania get here. Unfortunately, elected toddler President. deeply related fact inseparable reality, often talk race gender exclusion economics. want us talk three ways intersect interact.  Dr. Birx gone completely Dark Side. Glad works you.

My spouse like old couple mentioned before. It‚Äôs nice able pure solitude even we‚Äôre home. anti-mask? human right? wear bra face instead mask wear mask cheast? wear mask face, freedom? Wtf wrong people anyone left. wtf? Texan, need anyone's threats permissions. kids attending till shit gets control. silenced sidelined‚Äô

I hope true. news media tends stay focused Trump people thrown bus past, valuable things say, soon ignored media. must hundreds casualties. usually silenced sidelined media Trump ousts them, right? two years old? usually don‚Äôt give shit yet, experience. classic. absolutely absurd thousands people gathering streets, yet small business Baltimore can‚Äôt open doors,‚Äù Hogan said, **‚ÄúAnd think Jack Young let small businesses open. long time ago.‚Äù**

lol? 935 third highest death toll MONTH. halfway month. Oh tell u correct! central California seems big problem. Canada? Name names! Lol read elderly people vaccine trials. want 94 year old mother line vaccine? No. Italy use skating rink makeshift morgue? Perhaps could one theme bars. gonna turn graphs really big numbers going small bars obfuscate horrific job we're doing. may also insistence ""listen sides"" equally valid. mean, probably going retire pandemic. nothing left lose. Trump orders less tests, stops reporting. What's left? one reason - want hurt people more. That's it. purpose cruelty. Oh shit, kid may brain injury it:

And researchers found baby presented neurological symptoms associated virus seen adults - neuroimaging analyses indicating white matter injury, caused vascular inflammation Sars-CoV-2 infection causes. mean would one first people die due comorbidities. However, he's probably first disconnect 4 year old vent drain his/her life force Soo... Sending places allows White House attempt discredit CDC releasing numbers analysis. continue send data CDC White House No, would take booster shot every year. need social distance vaccine Yes typically vaccines work...giving someone headache low grade fever doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù Well nobody keeps track numbers, nobody gets COVID dies COVID. Maybe scaled 6 billion people vaccine side effects would kill virus itself? take much knock 90 year old. Six states saw rise 100 (FL, CA, TX, AZ, GA, TN) number currently hospitalized COVID-19 patients. six set new record highs states.

18 states reported 900 new cases today. Nevada Texas hit new highs.

Arizona‚Äôs data muddled. Testing capacity maxed, affects case count, see similarity shape charts. looking metrics, today state reported record hospitalizations 2nd-highest number deaths.

From Covid Tracking Project sub still find way spin negative. Oh, order pick city. never available time slots within 4 days. dont space stock up, husband run store every day. America, country like bad comedy. rest world embarrassed think free. several grand per month participating trials. piss Musk fire bloke complete uphill gardener. cant HEAR TUBAS EARS Yup, knew least 10 people left NY morning lockdown either went Cali, TX Florida ride (and spread it). went back home week. third* Seems hes potential vector stupidity well. theory many people America quarantine hit didn‚Äôt sports, nights bar, distractions. thoughts. realized empty miserable lives really demanding haircuts beaches reopened They're reporting corona. People randomly dropping dead blood clots, organ destruction, pneumonia asphyxiation. Real medical mystery. CDC website still recommend wearing mask? Kinda conflicting info ya think. wasn‚Äôt tent. waiting van. care takers nursing home didn‚Äôt realize passed away backseat van. It‚Äôs odd story. Yup. We've 2 governors last 20 years. Oddly enough, means go back 3 last democrat governor. point charge people manslaughter.....eventually would catch on.....wear motherfuckers. Yeah, like that‚Äôs ever gonna happen. *closes book* raise generation Instagram model of; expect? Wanna take Selfie? Whatever want believe, guy doesn‚Äôt understand joke is. I‚Äôm curious opposite- social distancing may kill cold flu. 

But cold killing covid? Ha lolz wonder there‚Äôs going kids/teens/college students going epidemiology virology this, like people joining military 9/11. Obviously exactly apples apples maybe. Apparently UK Sweden well, everyone else has. classism. Back day, dark meant poor farmer. top that, colonialism means world brainwashed thinking light skin better. Fine them. Shut down. Jail comply. 

The absolute worst this, imho, healthcare workers risk lives caring 15%+ fuckwits wind ER can't breathe. 

I'm honestly angry recognize more. Whelp, looks like point people start dropping streets. transparency trump rule out, think kernel hope despite destruction incompetence new President able start healing process without us descending violent conflict. think thing keeping shit bay. know! country, Norway, pretty great (living capital) seen **one** person wearing mask since started. airplanes, day day life.

We've good distancing things. Apparently that's true, unfortunately. gonna happen. USA 1991 (ie. Fall USSR), wonder? tragic catastrophic sure. kind highly contagious hemorrhagic fever high fatality rates old young alike... wouldve end us.

Even Spanish Flu 2.0 would screwed, considering many people live different selfish reality refuse wear masks.

Maybe takes people bleeding eyes brains boiling take things serious ? Since balls shrink, holes lungs, life threatening blood clots isnt enough would seem. stores inside Costco offered services. believe one ""full release"" chicken.  Huh. I‚Äôve seeing articles like everywhere past 3 months. hope one true... America's problem conservative government. Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Australia UK run conservative governments handling COVID-19 really well. problem America American conservatives right literally every conservative party West main voter base uneducated religious people, instead affluent educated people like conservative parties West. Thus conservatives America tend extremely stupid compared conservatives developed countries. Like ask...

You open flood gates fools everything 'together' nation not. preliminary studies COVID-19 reinfection starting appear call conclusive yet, example French study--

 

It looked 11 patients COVID-19 diagnosis (symptoms tested positive), fought infection symptom-free, came back later COVID-19 symptoms tested positive again, many dying even worse cases second time around. Still, early really know common pattern, antibodies fade 1-2 months much data yet previously infected pool (which, even worst-hit countries, still tiny fraction population) doctors researchers would starting see reinfections. (We can't really use early cases ex. South Korea China simply clamped outbreaks thoroughly, they've prevented virtually viral pool recirculate among ex. people Wuhan initially infected.) Also there's perennial question whether ""long-hauler"" relapses vs. reinfections, though relapses, raise concerning questions different sort. I'm definitely antivaxxer (have necessary vaccines least one optional one), I'm still little wary vaccine created accelerated schedule like one. Seems like idea long term effects. tests seem reliable would like be. I've seen patient dozen tests, several unsurprisingly positive april symptomatic, recovery, run 7-8 negative end june positive, followed negative, another positive, negatives. reassuring. sit data make excuses needing validate hopes people stop paying attention. jokes old I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôre still around get COVID-19! Unfortunately reality people understand consequences beaten limit orders set broker execute certain price hit. know SEC rules order delay, likely orders set time ago.  imagine Republicans elected Rupaul 2016. would today look like? #restructthegoverment argue teaching kids use computers self learn relevance future disease ridden classroom.

and big mask face Damn people really paying attorney's rep dumb crap? could certainly affect that, account reading post thread, lol. correct, thinking total number deaths, IFR. Blindly following scientists scientific. patients pre-existing heart conditions? study seem handle possiblity. agree alarming select people study based hospitalized problem cohorts. Meaning group tested heart damage could also group bc heart damage. Heart damage mixed covid could reason covid patients ever hospitalized. poking holes dense, asking questions bc would important know combination pre-existing heart conditions, diagnosed not, mixed covid cause heart heart damage. Also seeing heart damage already lead covid infected people hospitalized. Heart disease leading cause death.

Edit: brought attention missed key sentence article. said team stressed patients hospital suspected heart conditions. know means pre existing study linked. least clickbait maybe bad study. Hard tell without seeing study. Articles without links actual study trusted. lot bad science going pre published results reported publications like one site source. flu season! Unfuckingbelievable happening America. Fuck freedom. Forced vaccinations need. Someone without mask day trying lecture mask. wanted leave 15 seconds later. Shit hilarious. CDC say whatever fuck think ""help"" us; fucking happening. Cool sensationalism post though. Yes, according website, Kansas state reported yet. last week lol mean said ‚ÄúRight United States people walking around masks ‚Ä¶ think healthcare providers needing people ill.‚Äù 

What smoking gun is! long antibodies last? going need booster every 3 months? want make covid goon squad runs around city hazmat suits beating antimaskers. type people live thinking nothing consequences literally beaten RIP HK  Good information! shit makes furious. family holed since beginning March, I'm one leaves, get groceries, always mask. kids miss grandparents, miss friends. shit would wrapped now, countrymen selfish puds! Transfusions one most-used cures probably effective. One person rejecting blood anecdote. patients pre-existing heart conditions? study seem handle possiblity. agree alarming select people study based hospitalized problem cohorts. Meaning group tested heart damage could also group bc heart damage. Heart damage mixed covid could reason covid patients ever hospitalized. poking holes dense, asking questions bc would important know combination pre-existing heart conditions, diagnosed not, mixed covid cause heart heart damage. Also seeing heart damage already lead covid infected people hospitalized. Heart disease leading cause death. yes. yey cake! It‚Äôs much better eliminate WH recipient. sounds like fake news unfortunately true. bar normalizes socializes drinking. drinking home alone friend, hopeless drunk. bar, well part *scene* people drinking, that's okay. *I* problem, *everyone* problem I'm sure problem waaaaaay worse mine I'm smart strong.

Oh, maybe I'll fall sex. Masks stab innocent old man, fuckface. would eat? 

I guns I‚Äôll always food. else would get food New England builds wall? LaPook, March 8: There‚Äôs lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who‚Äôs infected prevent infecting someone else‚Ä¶ Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You‚Äôre sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: ‚Ä¶There‚Äôs reason walking around mask. you‚Äôre middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it‚Äôs providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks ‚Äî that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm it. want it, that‚Äôs fine.

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that‚Äôs point. could lead shortage masks people really need Ron Howard narration: ""They didn't"" Like, high school 1337 haxor rebel day. fuck happened. old person now. bullshit. Fuck biology. Agreed, friends relatives dying, mortality rate make difference. gave upvote got zero might fauci told us wear masks :/ Soitanly!!  leveling again! flattened curve!

Transcript:
""My name Matt Pallardy I'm owner Self Made Training Facility Mission Bay San Diego want message get San Diego specifically gym owners San Diego know another gym owner, uh, please share them. Uh, King Newsom decided shut kinds stuff including indoor fitness centers again, based on, know, dont know facts exactly, but, uh, let San Diego everyone know closing doors would love see gym owners take stand. Stay open, um, I'm sure got hit really f*ucking hard last time, uh, like pretty much every business owner definitely gyms so, know, cant afford again, cant let guy tell us anymore, need think right, so, we're staying open. hope too.""


Key takeaways:

1.""King Newsom decided shut kinds stuff including indoor fitness centers again, based on, know, dont know facts exactly, but,""
 
Denialism: position reject propositions strongly supported scientific historical evidence seek influence policy processes outcomes accordingly. afraid fake news, conduct research, without bias.


2. ""this let San Diego everyone know closing doors would love see gym owners take stand.""

Encouraging others take blind stance.


3.""we cant afford again,""

Profits Health &amp; Safety. ¬†Adapt, find better solution business offer services healthy safe way.


4.""we need think right, so, we're staying open.""

Naturally, gravitate towards solutions fit perspective; decisions strongly influenced cognitive bias, even though may right thing do. Hopefully rest country stop (at least openly) racist stupid Trump leaves office Thanks someone actually patience discipline. go order work since start this. everytime im really pisses see many people cant stay asses home least wear mask. 

They reason rest us havent able enjoy normalcy reopening. Im convinced truly horrific disaster virus pops American population meet demise pure arrogance stupidity They‚Äôve switched saying ‚Äúcoronavirus real, MEDIA response Covid hoax.‚Äù genuinely idea severity you‚Äôre even referring to. use word severe describing side effects dosage used. Mild fatigue? Chills? Muscle pain? That‚Äôs causing concern? wise comment, know downvoted. relatives love hesitant vaccines would never mock bully them. think they're 100% wrong, they'll never listen word say treat respect. Listening someone's fear offering factual (and compassionate) response breed understanding. Maybe he's nostalgic 1980s world fooled genius business man life seat cool self made rich kids table. grifter. folks run elections knowing they'll trounced. make money spread disinfo. lol terrible read said. never suggested someone able exercise 1st amendment rights. going current situation would better wearing mask. clear reading wrote. casualties cannot hidden anymore, blame BLM protestors. Place anyone looks like could participated house arrest. Continue hold election without them? NY got hit first, made mistakes therefore suffered.

However, right things reaping benefits.

These 2 facts mutually exclusive. People state good lesson states without people jumping throats. think great decision. also think shows far T-man's influence fallen can't even get Texas follow along.

Much better holding seminar teachers fill will. Really? heard - I'm hearing one-off random stories, definitely heard widespread crippling. thought unique American stupidity reluctance wear masks freedumb got us mess. fact count people exposed virus, even though tested positive, virus shocks me. That's science, that's instilling fear public. 

Fyi wear mask go out. I'm one anti maskers. I'm commenting initially said ""dont wear mask"" early days virus caused confusion later on. Thursday White House report pandemic new cases since Wednesday? Problem look US 50 different countries travel restrictions. Lockdowns went place hard hit areas like NYC, seattle, Cali people instantly fled. Places like Lombardy fines, restricted travel helped curb spread. NYC Cali, Washington governors gave people 2 day notice going lockdown (people clue type lockdown for) left droves south. Every state followed suit 1-2 weeks later damage already people fleeing hotspots. states fled little cases time people really take lockdown serious. Like 85 cases city population nearly 1 mil shutdown. People therefor take serious led never actually decreasing numbers. Couple huge influx carriers hotspots, city blown cases lockdown lifted. two months lockdown people want go back it. Hell even kept lockdown, probably would still never gotten rid it.  us, bud. fucking didnt shit ass auto mod lot parents going severe childcare issues

We nationwide reevaluation minimum age leaving kids home alone order go work fall. anything fix it, they're trying make harder Americans know bad is. fucking matter.... without pushing fines PEOPLE punishing business still many wearing masks. Need stop giving people wearing ""health reasons"" I'm sorry stupid excuses issue find one works you. I'm really hoping teachers Highly Suggest students strike. mean, high schoolers lose? They're paid, can't vote, worst-case scenario get sent juvenile detention center equally crowded ü§∑ really like monthly bases, I'm dating Canadian want move month month extensions give roller coaster emotions every time. I'm like, 'oh finally reunite?' crushed though hope bad crazy situation goes on. Student here. Yup. I'm one wanting go back, even though fucking final semester. Sending National Guard inside private businesses help numbers circumvent scientific study. Republicans fine this. Imagine Dems tried this. Thank comment! mother gay kid useful information me. know overlooked developments. seem free programs young gay men area. constructive discussion kid. Hoping practice safe sex case, something needs know added protection. Hopefully ok contacting clinic time open talk us find medical professional look option. Thank fucking god SO. Black Death Friday. could stop testing eliminate cases completely. /s 
No he‚Äôs genius. He‚Äôs got point here. 

I‚Äôve told expert people actually make good eating. complete nutritional profile one package. 

And, unlike deer such, super easy hunt. evasive skills whatsoever. whack head gut (plenty YouTube videos demonstrate techniques). 

Many specimens finely marbled. Young children infants particularly tasty tender. 

Give Rush credit here. send traffic linking site? moved US BC August 2019 cannot believe fortuitous timing was. Can't imagine city moved right happier am. says 2 3 year old children attending class fall he'd ""zero concern sending back"". 

ZERO?? 

I guess he's bad governor bad father well. Don‚Äôt tempt them. Big Pharma exactly charitable sort business. Florida man Ron DEATHsantis? Anytime want move Hurd. They‚Äôre going use shit excuse.  Ôøº people stable jobs. 

There ""gig economy"" revolution get paid based task performed, unstable type work basically. 

Rent also getting record high. Companies like Black Rock massive real estate purchases landlord America. 

So average American working ass pay rent stay alive. real different slaves plantations work get fed. forget freedom kill otherwise imperil countrymen without consent. That's important What's going happen next? Someone florescent hazmat suit shooting supersoaker tainted covi saliva crowd dancing Darudes Sandstorm?

With I've seen even try doubt it. Wow... news in... 6 months late. school districts, operate independently Georgia, authority open operate exclusively online professionals day say infected person wearing mask prevent spread. Everyone wearing mask reduces press Fauci said correct. Source stats? find fascinating. FUN GUYS!?!?! /s current statement man made us false? Im extrovert come. shit killing spirit refuse risk lives loved ones fun. Thank you. help. 

The hear I'm thinking comes out, we'll get moment publicly available. see trend tho? 2003, 2012, 2020. looks like around every 8-10 years, deadly coronavirus, probably keep following trend, may even happen frequent like instead every 10 years, becomes every 6 years something universal vaccine coronavirus. chinese working it, started human trials last month. Norwegian researchers looking creating one too.

 almost expecting rickroll, reddit ruined ‚ÄúWe....cant.....too.....MUCH..........FREEDOM......

This virus seriously deadly anyone age 80. Kids parents totally fine. keep grandma home grocery shopping.

You dormers need chill. able adapt that's case.

You can't adapt dying COVID. say deliberately misled people. article actually quote below. answers recommending masks:

""*Well, reason concerned publc health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply. wanted make sure people namely, health care workers, brave enough put harm way, take care people know infected coronavirus danger getting infected.""*

He say anything deliberately 'misleading people effectiveness'. went corner store pick food last night. saw one person wearing mask properly. employees pulled down, one could pick teeth, nose. Meanwhile customer checking lady old wind could blown wearing mask around chin side morbidly obese man walks restroom mask. way man front smoking mask homeless looking kid chinning mask talking him. doomed. Yeah can't imagine going forward either. Still trying figure hell nba Florida. ,in fact, advice masks COVID declared pandemic WHO.

But arguing going dumb comment. Outlive De Santis piss grave, objective  won‚Äôt get anything resembling real numbers Wednesday making Trump look bad? political ploy pathetic. Dear Americans. Go ""American"" somewhere else. soon come ""American"" then, fuck off. point surprised mls finish SW side, it‚Äôs usually ok Saturday evening restaurants malls packed 50-75% people wearing masks. agree. need need take every safety precaution. sake sake everyone else road speculate, there's possibility he's decided serving beyond much headache freed break rank he's decided last term.

I really hate US handling covid.   That's one part equation. let's see longevity t-cells. anecdotes people getting second time, circumstances unclear. immune system response measured, far known exactly long memory cells know deal COVID-19 coronavirus. 

Ultimately, known, believed can't catch short succession. Yeah trending point going dip US near future immigrate somewhere else country idea wearing mask worst thing since hitler? Good luck Yeah let‚Äôs blame administration time. Wait goes backwards phase 3 1? can‚Äôt figure tell people thing without scoffing like I‚Äôm dramatic. SCARY! government already botched pandemic, worse. longer get CDC updates, Trump wants us see. illegal! I‚Äôm MD/PhD student PhD molecular biology moonlighting COVID-19 research ‚Äî hope helps put mind ease bit.

It‚Äôs mRNA vaccine, obviously isn‚Äôt going *remotely* significant risk genomic integration, barring truly astronomical coincidence, even *astronomical* chance integrates anywhere, that‚Äôs still likely cause oncogenic changes. think truly bizarre circumstances *might* cause potentially *not impossible*, it‚Äôs vanishingly small chance.

The components vaccine degraded excreted pretty quickly, it‚Äôs producing particles virus without particularly impressive adjuvants, risk autoimmune reaction pretty minimal well, seeing that‚Äôs significant clinical effect COVID-19.

There‚Äôs question there‚Äôs always remote possibility problems, none components particularly new thought dangerous. I‚Äôm HCW since I‚Äôm med school, I‚Äôll probably offered vaccine late year works, won‚Äôt second‚Äôs hesitation taking it.

My biggest fear regards vaccine needle, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm terrified needles begin with. Common sense listening rich people NWO plan That's data analysis works, bud.

Also erodes public's faith journalism whole. arguments. also need link study. That‚Äôs Trump make sure gets four terms. keep control. I'm supporting him. I'm pointing ""stable genius"" ""the best deal maker"" would capitalized situation. believe it, support thing downside (according people actually study things) immense upside benefit immensely. need control one comes ideas always gotten way anything reasonable.

Very tough. whole thing obscene. excuse us ample supplies point. again, also excuse many cases. fair say let virus spread crucial time keeping contained, right? yeah mean, fact may work afford eat factor much Trump's talking point he's handled better Obama handling Swine Flu long. bio-hacking, test subject. hot cold showers make feel robust within days, stop it. 15,000 IUs vitamin D3 make feel better improve skin sleep within week so, naturally abandon it.

I 74 years old health hobbyist past 50 years. Thanks feedback. type serve, build ego. Timmy...do like movies Gladiators? absolutely stock sales scheduled months ago. Executives can't day-trade stock based positive news reports.

If hanky-panky going on, would fact rushed initial report order beat timing already-scheduled stock sales. Great job US, take badge honor! I‚Äôll happily take Oxford vaccine day one. admit I‚Äôm little nervous mRNA thing since it‚Äôs never actually done before. god awful town live in? heard single thing anti-mask except Denny's Holyoke servers wear masks ""it's hot"". see wet rat trying jump sinking ship Serious question: going blame becomes inevitable failure? purpose CDC guess what‚Äôs gonna happen ‚Äúmuh liberties‚Äù You‚Äôre right - started wearing mask public Feb 2nd kept wearing even CDC got around acknowledging established science masks month later. I'm hoping one else go it. There's already many people going Uhhhh... *antibodies* temp. B Cell memory looks promising understand. doesn‚Äôt seem like Georgia spoiled brats! Oh, wait, right. Nvrmnd. shit-hole States raise em real fucking wrong don‚Äôt they?  honestly looks like us going one wave point  need folks like Fauci giving called ""experts"" criticism. evil men succeed good men nothing, case hundreds thousands (if millions) lives line I‚Äôll take butthole works ayyy same! üôÉ Using BMI NFL players silly told since.... March.... r/conservative way Smart. Next remove oxygen peoples homes fucktards. No. lock strictly cases it‚Äôs high. escalating cases lock relax. America nothing ... even obeying phase 1 cases still high. Check ur facts u ask article explains pretty well! It‚Äôs possible caused initial spread. also spring break likely spread it. 

In fairness though, people know fled NYC quarantined got there. Data point one though. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Article presents picture masking ineffective public settings. ‚ÄúWe know wearing mask outside health care facilities offers little, any, protection infection. ‚Äú

Anyone know actual studies refute assertion? He‚Äôs right tho  wish best, much hope it. September fast-approaching, even vaccine trials going well, can't see commercially available time afterwards. already? Look state. one responsible disaster happening right now, beginning. don‚Äôt see would problem. No, please send back.  Exactly lol! guy excellent job summarizing issues lol  world continues look US horror insurmountable levels stupidity Average American here. spent first two months inside w/ exception grocery store runs. last 6 weeks masks only. governor recently created hotline report people businesses directly state government following guidelines. We're one states w/ things control. 

And easy. wear mask, wash hands, politicians believe science. CDC broken? isn‚Äôt. fucked many levels. Trump needs removed enough enough. I‚Äôm sick seeing narrow minded idiot making decisions country. Enough enough 
Plus don‚Äôt want socialism. 

Also, someone might tie mask take guns. Lol. haven‚Äôt seen data many clinical trials think high dose ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù. .... sentence. I'm fully aware everyone. example probably one many.

Perhaps lieu strike, way ""route around"" damage - everyone resign? Preserves time credits, pensions, etc yet keeps teachers safe? Yes. You‚Äôre wrong this. many people never infected NYC. That‚Äôs governor idiot utter incompetence government/administration shown far, blame people trusting rushed vaccine? I'm sorry bud. I'm sorry live crap. think illiteracy finally catching us! People think we're supposed ""fattening"" curve instead ""flattening"" curve. 20 years. Give time true! see ""masks communism"" downvoters fully now. Moderna publish data today too? Pfizer published data NEJM today, figured article talking Pfizer. 

Has Astra Zeneca published P1/2 data yet? careful trump dump telling truth Things different vaccine actually here. Then, actually tout vaccine's safety thoroughly tested. Right big mystery.

Also know lot people say stuff like ""I'll wait bit get it"" -- healthy adult, getting months approval. It'll go healthcare workers immunocompromised first. We'll months see people healthy &amp; fine. millions people around world would've gotten it. time average healthy American adult's turn get it, we'll begging it.  reason vote president next election, sure.

Ah nice, I've looking one time now...

**/S** compared makes claims I'm fairly certain false. It'd one thing article stick claims vaccine science, progress, etc. Instead makes point mentioning relation others, either lying selectively ignoring truth. One repeating BS 100s others happen argument opinion Well, get you, one Trump's Covid rally parties will. literally seems get spreading virus. ""open country""

'stop closed' Yay! :D Pile dead Jim, next republican campaign office. guys furrow eyebrows conceern us well?

Ambulances take closest hospital accept you. cities, poor people get routed worse hospitals. long time, South Side Chicago didn‚Äôt emergency room losing money U Chicago (now do.) non-emergency, get care based insurance covers. Different hospitals different COVID19 fatality rates, best hospital isn‚Äôt covered exchange option Obamacare. I‚Äôve also seen doctors give attention provide tests rich people poorer patients seen teaching hospital.

It‚Äôs also worse poorer areas city literally worse pollution. Chicago, botched demolition pandemic shutdown clearly worsened air quality. Even pandemic, areas higher rates childhood asthma asthma exacerbation require hospitalizations.

This didn‚Äôt happen accident. It‚Äôs secondary segregated housing, deliberately caused racist policies. (Redlining, GI benefits provided Black vets, etc) You‚Äôre exactly right. Hospitals determine triage system, politicians. Yeah people fucking dieing may actually supersede economy. People US get caught symbolism don‚Äôt focus enough works. started CDC lied said masks necessary governments could stock healthcare workers could get some. they've lost credibility hard get back trust lied. think need admit lied (and explain why) rather continuing false narrative new research changed recommendations. would step towards regaining trust.

We'd welcome sane masked ass NY want join us right side history. Thanks ü§ó 2023 optimistic. Like that‚Äôs assuming lot things. inability people realize science takes time often misinformation along way practical solution astounding. I'm flabbergasted people wanting run course. multiple millions dead best case scenario virus actually leaves antibodies behind long enough get twice create new mutation along way. youre okay thousands people protesting shoulder shoulder almost 2 months long ""bare minimum"" stop spread? sounds like arbitrarily saying gets exercise 1st amendment depending cause agree with. hilarious moment greatness this, perhaps thing correctly, opening salvo probably done hurt China help America.

Blaming China point moronic. Every single country dealt blow China, ain't complaining, know why? actually something cards dealt. Whilst Trump still claiming saved 1000s lives stopping flights China... OK, great, declaring war late March killed 10s 1000s, well done sir. gotta watch cars drive circles...

We lock down. efficacy masks question time, *and* going anywhere public, *and* concern providing PPE medical personnel ""essential workers.""

You're liar. lying conventional sense, yes said things. attempts exclude greater context order discredit Dr. Fauci makes liar. 

And service Trump. 

You absolutely respect yourself. Trump believes whatever wants Republicans willing remove him, he's right. OOOOOH SAFETY!! made argument consider patient means. Maybe loose sick person patient doctor's care? think title problematic maybe bad originally thought. argued op decided problematic complete garbage. think? think potential something happening, even unlikely. die wins smug face sure way talking lot &amp; saying nothing. 

Also, miss something? impression schools get funding start person lessons. seemed suggest district autonomy start online feel it‚Äôs necessary. Unfortunately still many people arguing ‚Äúmah rights‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs slippery slope government fucking wife‚Äù right military never overthrew government feel pretty depressed wish could close damn border, open properly, watch everybody else burn. watching trainwreck since Nov 2016. shit bothers end, claim Christian values ACTUALLY mean ""it's okay hate gay people claim love Jesus."" Anything helping need? ""Fuck 'em, government dictate kind thing""  Fudging number time honor tactics far Trump experience CEO go. Turn signals aren't. Neither insurance think destroys stupid countries.

We hold Trump accountable ballot box. cannot hold people like Fauci responsible.

Then gall say bases stuff says truth science? thinks paying attention hearings interviews he's doing. base selling lie masks make weak. It‚Äôs trumps ego appear threatened anything. big man stand ‚ÄúChinese Hoax‚Äù Lol thought said dont wear masks cuz dont anything. ridiculousness people  hardly union all

That's design. Texas (and really Southern states degree other) sees feature bug I'm introverted loner. lifestyle's barely changed. need lie too, USA embarrassment too. someone world favor burn us down. mean, understand needing/wanting check property. goodness sake FOLLOW QUARANTINE RULES (or guidelines, even laws wherever going) do! live certain city central Missouri requiring masks idea brought overwhelming amount people it. conservative here. easy google, please give link. easy then. I'm trying figure things
1) wearing masks become pervasive many Asian cultures?
2) conversely catch USA now, infringement rights?
3) cultures emphasize mask wearing prevent disease spread?
4) many businesses/companies ramp mask social distancing swag quickly? messaging every evolution aspect virus PISS POOR execution left us wide open bullshit politicization we‚Äôre experiencing now.

This good governance important. Incompetence evident crisis.

Even messaging around coronavirus awful large sections American population buying conspiracy theories. &amp;#x200B;

***""*** ... ***actions*** .***considered criminal*** ....***he forcibly removed post ""***\---that great(it right thing do)

,but people hold breath happen(sadly)

after all, US regime even convicted criminals sentence/conviction swiftly pardoned/commuted leader  Sorry. trust Trump's yes men. Moderna questionable hiccups late,so good see data there. promising. Even ""the one"", could really helpful arsenal. Vaccines induce stronger immune responses getting virus naturally would fake news.

So, several dozen paragraph article, **two** sentences talk devastating ground breaking Trump administration poised ask governors **consider** sending National Guard hospitals help improve data collection novel corona virus patients, supplies capacity, according draft letters, internal emails officials familiar plans‚Ä¶

So, words done anything regards CDC HHS officials Monday finalized new data reporting protocol hospitals, eliminate Centers Disease Control Prevention data recipient, leaving health-care institutions report information covid-19 federal contractor state, would coordinate federal reporting.

Litteraly even week ago, front page post Atlanta reporting cases correctly. Basically saying downplaying numbers cases. Edit: [This article Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) national public health institute United States. United States federal agency, **under** Department Health Human Services,[2] headquartered **Atlanta, Georgia**

This boils Trump administration making sure factual numbers reported. Actually protecting citizens fine country corrupt officials lying numbers. Masks let virus-containing aerosol block oxygen molecules, apparently. Magic. http://www.columbia.edu/~jls106/galanti_shaman_ms_supp.pdf

I know interested scanning article. (I find via google realized downloads.)

Down around line 190 one places authors talk multiple infections virus. OC43 etc designations different viruses testing for. 
 study participants, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times study coronavirus: 9 tested positive multiple times OC43, 2 tested positive twice HKU1, 1 tested positive twice 229E nobody tested positive multiple times NL63.

Nothing definitive study remembered sort kept door open immunity question. No, I'm US, wish Canada :D Trump wants virus control. better looking! long New York ordering travellers hot spot states self-quarantine instead diverting passengers arriving planes hotels keeping guard 10-14 days, dreams virus-free continue dreams. Go 800M. That's way entire country worship 'smart'. county ordinance, state.  half counties Florida mask orders all. Almost none enforcement significant degree. 

Much resistance comes governor -- DeSantis says masks optional, people feel cannot required counties cities.  Tell men don‚Äôt wear masks shown smaller penises.. maybe get somewhere. Listen up,

something far worse coming try *sideline* everything thus far. Mean , pandemic prejudices protests.

We eliminating anything: everything brought light heading towards formidable *pit* gasoline. aren‚Äôt healthcare worker elderly don‚Äôt count getting vaccine another year 2. goes vulnerable first. There's fucking way disinformation Russian psyop crumble country fucking ground. see covid affects mostly communities colors smoking weed like going style. plus endless parade JRPGS like social connections.

Are *sure* extrovert? is. much resilient us.. fine, us, parents, sad. stay-at-home order going drive people socialize homes, disastrous consequences community spread.  would counterproductive. Continue mandate masking, crack ruthlessly businesses closing be, encourage outdoor activity replacement dangerous indoor activity. get better compliance lower transmission blanket ban. going die November trump like numbers!  demographic people highest infection rate Someone bring big board things Trump ""can't"" do; did. Duh CDC 100% broken. Robert Redford Trump devotee who'll suck even million Americans die this. Hopefully vaccines currently developed safe effective, available relatively soon. 

There testing Moderna vaccine shows immune system response. participants developed so-called neutralizing  

Now phase 3 30k tested see prevents COVID. know Trump isn‚Äôt president it, would possible presidents? drinking alone, social distancing. (I t-shirt says that). not. Thank thoughts. know Washington Post satire... Oh, wait... That‚Äôs said! Right, may need spend extra money help scientists get extra data. everything else Covid-19 related, come whether political so. based premise HIV vaccine could *possibly* exist. 

Either way, certainly acknowledge possible never find vaccine. also acknowledge statements regarding statistics contingent humanly possible develop vaccine. vaccine could created, everything said stands true - vaccine trials inherently increases likelihood finding effective vaccine soon humanly possible Another 4 weeks, another 700% increase Montana get real serious it. FDA approval process horrendously slow visited friend Upstate New York like 1940. really sad holding everyone back matter western politician prefer put economy threat virus (Example: Italy, US, UK, Spain etc...) act inevitable (italy, UK etc...)

Country like Vietnam (0 death) Taiwan (7 deaths) learn lessons SARS Swine Flu, shut thing month control situation, enjoying economy return almost normal situation. 

In end, one shut early would better economic growth end year compare hesitated shutdown all. sam hell going around ? must, though. Since showing obvious disdain disregard lives others. pretty bad cognitive dissonance can't even admit that. Yep, exponential growth action. Seriously, fucking hard wearing mask. Honestly wonder didn‚Äôt dog shit education system people knew words like ‚Äúexponential growth‚Äù meant we‚Äôd much better situation. 

We reap sow. want wake nightmare üò´  believe illness spread coughing/sneezing shield stop much, mask ‚ÄúKids aren‚Äôt high risk‚Äù generalized, insensitive thing say. son asthma, therefore high risk. He‚Äôs also child. LOTS children asthma preexisting conditions. It‚Äôs tiring see people act like lives don‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre majority. No. stated wearing mask would increase person‚Äôs frequency touch face thereby increasing chances virus entering body via eyes, nose mouth.

This medical community placing emphasis contact transmission aerosol. Which, again, another black eye medical community. Oh shit, subs worse nightmare anecdotal evidence starting pile up. Listen Week Virology. give clinical updates, people getting reinfected suffering protracted infections/post covid immunological syndrome. appears second time people get it, get much sicker. California, much works, define Cases, people tested positive currently Infected, go Isolation, county 10 days, plus 7 days symptoms. People Contacts Cases told Quarantine 14 days last contact Case. I‚Äôm sorry buying lunch health care workers kinda cop good publicity point. I‚Äôm sure appreciate many folks saw hospital area post list places donate getting much food. There‚Äôs many privileged kids use depend school breakfast lunch. mention lack PPE health care workers millions folks like job. America many millionaires billionaires ever time donate it. Hell even pop stars movie stars telling people wear masks party means hell lot politicians point least U.S. Unfortunately based turned Mattis, I‚Äôm holding much hope that. there‚Äôs federal mechanism law nobody enforce it. dual citizen :/  I'm Canadian citizen, though. They'd let in.

I'd quarantine month to. Another great idea! Well, mean brag... around 300,000 combined teachers support staff FL, that's 3000 dead. Edit: math erroneous.

That's counting older vulnerable teachers.

That's counting people disease spread outside schools. must describing Florida Man democracy one gets voted for. country showed 2016 stands hate racism. 

54% white women voted Trump policies hate. 

And millennials love memes voting shows. sometimes people like going friends desire around drunk assholes much?  


As someone owns bar make mediocre best drinks, yes. That's lifelblood whole segment service industry. Outdoor transmission remains unlikely.

Masks distancing would better, \*encouraging\* outdoor socializing replacement in-home socializing, major cause community spread right now. 


From Dr. Julia Marcus Harvard, infectious disease epidemiologist, NY Times article weeks ago:

 
 ‚ÄúOutdoors save us. can‚Äôt message be: ‚ÄòWe understand want get together friends. ways safely.‚Äô We‚Äôre telling gather. doesn‚Äôt recognize basic human behavior basic human needs.‚Äù That's terrible. However, know testing anyone/everyone desires test? people symptoms contact known case? 

It might 62% general population positive. (But could get there.) mean like last minute preppers hurricane less day away hitting home every shelf picked clean? example could 4 minute mile, 3:45 mile. could 2 seconds. idea still stands strong.

Both cases result outlier. within norm way outside it. Hence statement arguement explaining idea trying convey. 

Meanwhile even end everything result arguing. Sounds like trolling unchecked psuedo intellectualism believe undoubtedly right everyone else gasping superior are.

Wish best life something tells soft skills crutch may take life time overcome. Great idea! Europe 0.05, countries 0.02 even 0. impaired partial evidence impairment 0.02% BAC, major conclusion study 0.04% BAC, measures impairment statistically significant direction degraded performance. data provides evidence BAC impairment occur.
Rather, evidence significant impairment throughout BAC range 0.02% 0.10%, increasing percentage subjects impaired increasing magnitude impairment higher Right?!? get super stressed show every.damn.time. 

When VC sat computer erased code? heart attack. Lol dont think changing protocols already confusion loaded situation helpful anyone....if protocols bad first place? I'm pretty dumb wear mask keep distant. Granted, mask built-in full-body Spiderman onesie, that's fashion purposes also shoot webs people wearing masks. know make silly string yeast hydrogen peroxide?

My family's American, kind greed pretty universal unfortunately. That's send mi daughter school meningitis tuberculosis breakout neither. can't decide properly risk covid enough data. Furthermore, going go school never again, wait vaccine. Socialization issues bad unknown life threatening health problems sound much better. I'm sorry % avoidable risk I'm willing accept girl zero. Problem look US 50 different countries travel restrictions. 

Most Canadian provinces travel restrictions either. People told travel though, people followed this. roads empty even cities. People going unless absolutely to. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* infected, sure hell wouldn‚Äôt volunteer try getting reinfected again.   This. Barely mask ib sight here. assume carousel Trump tweets general fear brown people. virus mutates every 2 weeks understand. Fortunately (kinda), viruses tend evolve towards strains less likely kill host, easily spread. Keep telling pal. don‚Äôt agree viewpoint must want millions dead. Whatever makes feel good. Don‚Äôt think much doom, it‚Äôs healthy.  reusable n95 mask Michigan united liberty sounds like name politicians might pick cover real aim. long waits going make people want get tested less. test supposed stay home two weeks waiting result get paid? think many people companies pay sick leave even allow without proof positive test. People forced choose jobs safety others, see ending well either way. agree wearing masks important. thread spikes cases. think think five guys others behave like cause something else?  I‚Äôm SW Tucson experience. Although last two days retail associate I‚Äôve seen: One lady covering mouth hands alternating, breathing directly hands, handing cash. One old lady came younger kid, wearing masks, old lady‚Äôs mask made porous/lacy material. old lady pull mask lick fingers count money. Countless people wearing mask remove constantly shopping, pull speak me, people say ‚Äúsorry, left mask car‚Äù like apologizing makes difference. get fuck here. Oh yeah, also signed paper company saying can‚Äôt kick anybody store face covering. always wear mask, wash hands frequently, stay away people much possible...

...and every time go store I‚Äôm excited see people stare everyone like crazy person want friends them. Republican governors crack get rational long January. know people ultimately hold accountable... Trump blame governors also. Abbot Texas already begun crack, issued mask order July 2nd things still getting worse Texas.  

Gov. Greg Abbott orders Texans counties wear masks public
Abbott previously resisted calls order one point banned local governments requiring masks. First-time violators issued warning, though repeat offenders could fined Worry not. white men benefit 2A promised they'll snap action second smell tyranny. godDAMN excited get back classroom weeks, wohoo glad kids get classrooms too, teachers kiss one senator's ass. 

Jesus Christ. oldest hospitalized influenza couple years ago 6, scary fuck. can't handle though co-occurance flu &amp; covid. getting 15 extra flu shots year. Good, give two medals. Nobody. That's still shelves. Fitting 20s suppose Low spread, businesses open, restrictions lifted, schools open. 
This countries took seriously start at. 

But know what? America fine, wear mask impede freedom. That's wanted hear. 
Keep nothing, working really well far.  true virus? Good new folks, transmission COVID high enough hold phase 3 test trials back yard! /s Impressive talent, it? woken 6 morning kids scream reading book üòÇ fair, fit story perfectly. current actions government seem like, you, actions people want 1% black population die? anything, would agree really want would kill 1%. completely surreal. Uhhhh avoid new cases week 4 resulting daily deaths week 7, on....

edit: wanted emphasize since brought up, Italy daily deaths peaked 917. Texas destroy number schools fill up.   point Germany majority places put actual laws, something many places America refuse do. Instead, rely ""encouragement"" rubbish like that. Without clear legislation, cannot even arrest someone wearing mask, we? would ever want anything could cause someone much devastation? Everyone else road idiot. 

I use philosophy everything. Including COVID. read scientific articles I'm interested. want info, go research yourself. I'm Google. glad see someone cares us since dont.. Thank you. idiots stubborn assholes going kill rest us :( issue country big heterogeneous. even laws Malaysia put effect stop people party business. It‚Äôs amazing entire world hoax conservative christians ones know real truth!

In countries left house lockdown would get ass beat, us Americans can‚Äôt even wear mask!!! think people perfect make mistakes, even experts field. also think learned covid daily basis.

Glad see someone bullied silence. really hope election comes soon everything Trump drives shit rebuild/reestablished. emergency, tell boss go run door you, chance, live place smart people culture? America finally encountered issue can't distract people away starting another war. idea deal it. Dude, I'm pretty sure everyone took vaccine year, would need masks next vaccine would next year. media get report real numbers. can't hide them, try drown truth, going work. illogical looks like desperate move. Except we've never even quantified ""quickly"" throughout discussion, apart initial comment said ""well July"". Let's say well means least 3 months? vaccine April.

Unless saying virtually *impossible* vaccine ready year research started, 9 months phase 3 clinical trials started, analogy flawed.

I know amount trials result vaccine ready month now. vaccine trials likely vaccine **as soon humanly possible**. That's statistical fact

A better analogy goal find fast runner possible, would rather 50,000 candidates runner 1. chose impossible goal like 2-minute mile, never suggested impossible timeline vaccine, sure would suspect ""long-term damage""? Point epidemiology ANYWHERE suggests serious cases among children anything freak occurrences. state hospitalization kids 15 less 1%. death rate might well zero. Disease severity disease mortality correlated. going long-term damage organs, extremely sick disease. Statistically, happening.

But I'm happy see studies ANYWHERE calculate prevalence serious outcomes kids suggest anything extraordinarily rare. hope so. Honestly bring Influenza levels think would great people voluntarily wore them. Good news! Tomorrow we‚Äôre set host largest sporting event crowd since started. get repeating heard, viruses remotely work same. HIV never cleared body naturally. Lyme disease leaves bizarre lifetime scars many; SARS almost everyone scars nothing alike. Dengue mutated get infected one strain, make second infection far worse. Coronaviruses rhinoviruses create small immune response typically must fight many times life. 

Which every-other-virus options believe SARS-nCoV-2 works like? think mutate toward give enough hosts? correct answer ""we know"". People China wear masks sick courtesy people ü§Øüò≤

No one forces it, wear it‚Äôs nice thing do! Much better selfishly coughing &amp; sneezing everyone &amp; everything, spreading germs. 

But happens US? Politely ask someone wear face mask health pandemic &amp; lose damn mind!! Stomping feet, yelling, swearing, even coughing face! 

It‚Äôs sad ever say completely back normal trying argue semantics since proven wrong. thinking thing. Seems like forever ago.  I'm Spain. 3 year old girl, wearing mask touching face first day allowed out, without complaints. lockdown talked almost everyday virus able go play got ill, understood. painted mask lion's face first days kept roaring everyone saw. friends one wear masks well, even learned play park without hugs, touching sharing toys. Maybe 2 years little soon, children adapt learn really quickly; don' give keep trying done, health worth it. vote decide nothing. count vote decide everything

-Stalin

Can definitely applied situation. Trump wants yes men ones count cases deaths. reason believe vaccine literally impossible antibodies stick around long infection idiot making claims like this, utterly irresponsible. 

just antibodies fade, mean immunity, b cells cells looking promising far. ALSO retired nurse mean know tf talking about, nurses believe bs. note, also believe become endemic also believe become another common cold even flu. either virus weaken time, bodies immune systems adapt both.  control? you? Vancouver? data helps Yes, get test too. symptoms within six feet father ten minutes.

Even you, dad, test negative, could still positive. best time test seven days around someone virus. Getting testing earlier might result negative result virus reproduced enough found. 

You father isolate (separate separate anyone else house) waiting test results.

 Considering trial two injections, both? Even worst. scenario, guarantee bullseye even exists. throwing darts hoping hit something even know there! Unfortunately mods tend policy enough reports happen delete things. bad people know weaponize it. effective continuously here. much efficacy data prevention new infections. great generates immune response, we're making big assumptions translates outcomes we're really interested in. seriously think 7 year olds socialise friends meaningful way online? aren‚Äôt missing crucial brain development able play run around kids person? Unless im mistaken, reports reinfection anecdotal. well designed peer review study comes out, really dont know immunity look like.

I agree cautious claiming reinfection inevitable premature.

Edit: peer reviewed literature date casts doubt possibility reinfection. Nice summary JAMA:

""Can Patients Become Reinfected? Reports China Japan indicated patients COVID-19 discharged hospital negative RT-PCR result readmitted subsequently tested positive RT-PCR. unclear available information true reinfections tests falsely negative time initial discharge. However, coronaviruses demonstrate evidence reinfection, usually happen many months years.

President Donald Trump daughter senior advisor Ivanka Trump. 

KEY FACTS

‚ÄúMaking Ivanka Trump face campaign urging self-reliance simply surreal,‚Äù tweeted Nobel laureate New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.

‚Äú[Trump] elected, Ivanka &amp; Jared [Kushner] appointed royal, nepotistic decree,‚Äù wrote economist David Rothschild Twitter, sentiment echoed Brookings Governance fellow Norm Eisen.

The campaign ‚Äúhorrible, cruel message Americans lost jobs due nation‚Äôs failed pandemic response,‚Äù according New York University social science professor Eric Klinenberg.

‚ÄúIf would look (&amp; daddy employed whole life) could #findsomethingnew like going slave labor employing crook WH staff crook,‚Äù Ohio House candidate Shannon Freshour tweeted, referencing abuse reportedly suffered manufacturers First Daughter‚Äôs now-shuttered fashion label.

‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm speechless, sad,‚Äù National Murrow award winner filmmaker Chip Franklin tweeted, adding, ‚ÄúTrump . . . tells desperate families, you‚Äôre own.‚Äù

CHIEF CRITIC

Ivanka Trump. clapped back Hill TV host Krystal Ball, said ad campaign ‚Äúfits perfectly‚Äù Trump Administration‚Äôs ‚Äúbelief real problem people don‚Äôt want work, there‚Äôs raging pandemic.‚Äù Trump coolly replied, ‚ÄúI suggest visit FindSomethingNew.org.‚Äù

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* posted pre-election. Would love see follow-up piece four years later. it? dog groomers safe right now? curbside dog drop  They're going checking study participants date. Approval rejection vaccine happen long that. (No, idea exactly.) Trump could riding wave popular support right now.  
If Trump kind leader would shut fucking mouth let experts talking.  Trump incapable that; vain, stupid, sheltered ignoramus. Thank you. masked extrovert idea extroverts scorned! fact no-masker know shy. Contact tracers indicate lack mask-wearing social gatherings. people still walking around without masks, mask pulled down. see every time go anywhere. mask doens't work, Chile mandatory everyone use it, many months almost almost everyone using mask whole country still one countries dead per million World (maybe first) thing seems work social distance lockdown. Cases always low Manitoba, take away point though. Colorado everyone's coming Texas

Ah, know Eagle County then? Honestly, bullshit me. visiting states high infection rates certainly bring infection them. bringing tourists touristy things dumb perspectives. statement CDC director purely political.

So political statements RNC suck, rich assholes bringing killer virus states fewer healthcare resources a-okay?

Yeah, priorities whack. get point, would contained everyone wore masks. economic pain dragged bunch screaming babies. OC right wing snowflake capital LA, assholes voting open schools whole level go hell. Walmart people checking everyone wearing masks. 

Also Walmart there's nonstop protest Elijah maybe special case Oh, lazy top everything.

I sent reference article. Happy reading. short: 30-70% fever rates observed childhood vaccines Black Rivers Matter 100? chance fucking more? plenty people protest wear masks defeats entire purpose, protestors *completely* ignored social distancing. no, blm protestors take virus seriously, all. 

Take head sand. agree cause BLM also call irresponsible spreading pandemic making situation entire country worse.  cops forced hand. Nobody forcing non mask wearers hands. People protests handing masks social distancing impossibility hence good samaritans spending money give others masks time global pandemic learning seeing believing bad people color comes simple traffic ticket stop similar situation, main difference being, Nana money big house. Also three children hate other, different lives Will. gonna carnage fight whatever has.

She's 82, hopefully got another 15 years left, somehow doubt it. linked Vox article that's written single doctor's opinion piece ‚Äî¬†in link, doctor literally said ""I believe far likely patient fully recovered first infection.""

Can please point hundreds thousands reinfection cases documented mentioned above? Again, anything support ""general immunity last 9 12 weeks"" quote would super helpful. dose cause 40% number? Like grind use paint sprayer? Ok, wear mask stop expecting everyone else give damn well being. Take care I'll mine. Manitoba family still there. pretty pissed Pallister right now. done well controlling numbers see determined undo it. point even Nixon would better. obviously understand science better you.

You asked vaccines approved could cause 40% fever. childhood vaccines answer. 

Is ""fever"" new scary word world? risk assessment abilities seem really bad. lol Cuba early March stand said. last Cuba? 

I disagree Cubans critical thinkers. Cubans incredibly resourceful street smart, book smart. understand using back family. I'm sorry familial experience incredibly myopic extrapolate across Cuban population. make sense compare PhD studies family's say ""this Cubans educated"" when, someone advanced studies, well aware natural variation even among educated degrees US. 

Not able write speak Spanish definitely problem though Cubans great Spanish language education. family from? definitely norm common among Cuban Americans. like this, part prevent spread but, also still things enjoy. nothing deal, small adjustments still live lives safe. 

Thanks sharing experience! You‚Äôre fool DePaul ? CA going well. run platform government inept, immoral, incompetent get office, fulfill prophecy. pendemic gone? *... feeling one go bars.*

The reason teens listen Rock 'n Roll (or whatever music vogue sub-culture/geographical region) - desire member herd.

That, playing 'The Mating Game', go greatest variety choices.

And aware, even intuitively, alcohol effective social lubricant.

Which means ""going hiking safely"" definitely going activity selection high list.

Further, one unwisely chose combine ""going hiking safely"" alcohol, likely partner 'Mating Game' would mountain *And dating apps [one] meet people safely.*

NO. might text email someone, never chance 'meet' someone... say nothing possibility stick dick crazy. It‚Äôs hypothesis. actual fact consider overwhelming majority America either quarantined wore masks period time case numbers went up. 

The real way get control find vaccine.  sh:ts real mobile morgues deployed! bar *happening*. Yep, think lock horizon!

Pubs &amp; Clubs seem main problem. social distancing &amp; heaps drunk people bad combo. testing, catching mild cases. also lag time. BCC CDC email data 99.9 % survival rate. lying? Moderna article? 99.9 % survival rate.  RemindMe! 30 days Whatever argument 'kids' spreading virus much, son basically adult far SARS-CoV-2 concerned. would foolish go back school. shoes, I'd want *as safe possible* fall could fully healthily enjoy great things come spring semester senior year.

Is reason assume virus knows difference 18-year-old, 16-year-old, 40-year-old adult? Probably not. sliding scale transmissibility, small minors full grown adults, coronavirus son basically adult. way, way, way better nothing. Research shows covid mainly spreads though mouth, especially talking loudly, singing, etc. 

You focus 100% energy people wear mask all.  anti-china conspiracy people scream yell flagrant coverup? necessarily proactive. part, orders mask wearing reduces gatherings county's numbers getting hand, opposed statewide mandate. Drinking home sit back relax = Problem.

Drinking public people surrounding = Totally socially acceptable. take 6-pack park bench might able meet someone still maintain social distancing.

Although true 'someone' meet may 50-50 chance wearing blue uniform.

But hey - even happen, least get ride police car. cant afford another lockdown. fuck about? good good Whose they?

There big unknowns Coronavirus - partially due failure government prepare threat seriously.

1) unknown whether masks would stop viral particles (they do)

2) unknown whether medical providers access proper protective equipment (they now, might run masks).

3) unknown whether asymptomatic carriers people could spread COVID got sick (they can)

Right obvious everyone country wore mask left house, many less Americans would die. idea why, want play trump card early game.

#keepamericastupid 60% bullet? clear legislation would need least city, county, state governments agreement, feds (including circuit courts) decide get involved. Otherwise would endless shitshow manufactured outrage. 

But since Trump saying always favor masks, manages keep saying another month two maybe supporters decide always favor masks too. end all. bare minimum. pretty much always wear mask public times. Everyone right now. work nearly one would listen long without actually forcing it. Instead urging everyone likely near others near others inside building better wearing mask not. going anyway mask on. since one set protests need forced wear mask able see one set protests considered reasonable capable improving society. 


If protests wide use face masks would certainly happier not. protests happen masked would better. It, perfect name think mean ""at-will employment,"" employers require pretty much anything? ""Right-to-work"" (for less) means pay union dues even employer subject collective bargaining benefit result of. Haha first sentence Sure, filters definitely filter oxygen molecules oxygen molecules bigger viruses. seeing damage lungs asymptomatic children. ... don‚Äôt know going manifest year two years now,‚Äù Alonso said. ‚ÄúIs child going chronic pulmonary problems not?‚Äù Thanks, sounds like interesting reading. work DHR Hidalgo County, two covid units already getting maxed that‚Äôs even counting post July 4th wave patients. beaches could full enough. Friends work ICU Valley Baptist running space already expired patients. Absolute shit show coming August likely fake news. 

Am right? 

Guys? Mask messaging unclear start pandemic. true big unknowns Coronavirus - think government intelligence issues partly blame prepare threat seriously.

The Trump administration also fault trying strong arm government bodies downplay virus. side mass gatherings? Read fucking thing commenting, organs mentioned, lungs. believe so, numbers filtered contractors whoever else much wanna bet numbers match. allow certain people ""facts data"" side. 

False enough.   6 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 4 new imported asymptomatic carrier, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Sounds like CPC forgot zeros. Let fix it:

6 new imported cases, 0,000,000 new domestic cases, 4 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0,000 new domestic asymptomatic carriers Canadians going US bit lax (they fly over) maybe Canadians US could option. simply needs mandatory. France, example, violating country-wide quarantine (which lot stronger USA) got fine, lot fine given beginning. Money talks. parents could kick house, sure, that's think best.

My point parents can't force stay home school. can't seriously claim scarce PPE supplies horseshit pulled stealing reselling like bandits. governor smuggle supplies secret. China.

This seems like plot control good information true fascist fascion. lived Silicon Valley. documentary.

They hired Fake Steve Jobs one writers add verisimilitude. around 70+ hours per game (for least), JRPGs perfect quarantine companion. I've WFH whole thing, kids go bed, games welcome respite stress. Like companies one employee getting PPE contracts Actual Fuck! Houston seeing hospital full covid patients, military sending tent hospitals help overwhelmed places Texas, hey! Let's race thousands non-mask wearing folks come watch cars drive circles....

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Masks magic bullet.

Other places outside U.S. excellent progress weeks social distancing, quarantining infected persons inbound travellers, reducing social contact.

Sure, masks help alone solve pandemic. Literally solid. Like wearing rubber Halloween mask summer.

Ridiculous idea. tell mannequin safety glasses fogged yet. believe Detroit things working it. highly doubt NYC Philadelphia saying 60 years ""Boy sure glad finally recovering two nights riots back 2020!"" [this says stems Taft-Hartley Act 1947 made ""right work"" states thing. Texas became one year.

That **73 years ago**. literally Act Congress, meaning lawmakers passed act 90s 100s, long since dead created lab. try think possible consequences, unfortunately. isn‚Äôt true would insurance companies allow take hit? average American worker see premiums go up. kid \*wants\* go back school? Man kid/teen right now, COVID would greatest thing ever happened me. complete, awkward introvert back though. China. live? 

My city (Philly) good masks general, though still regularly see people hanging corners stoops without masks.

In areas country hardly anyone wearing mask. coincidence places hit hardest right now. Maybe 10:00 pm better time check death toll, right approaching 1000 today. CDC handed counting authority Trump appointed agency, numbers may become unreliable.  HK: (used) get shot wearing mask I'm Chicagoland area, I'm Wasau, WI right work. Nobody I've seen anywhere wearing masks, save employees gas stations there. 95% people not.

I ordered pickup restaurant, fucking packed. people indoors tables full. 

I guess we'll see plays out. Speak self . Many us mouths feed Reddit. use trebuchets here. Oh wanna compare Florida individual EU countries?

Guess what, shithead, FLORIDA STILL CASES. Yup. Illinois well deal surrounding states responsible Citizens allowed come home. tragic story. Yikes. Sorry hear that. Sure, sounds like one still living parent‚Äôs house. idea get anything said.

* live 100 miles away Eagle county, though unclear anything.

* Political statements useless, repeating arguing waste time. head CDC worried making political statements solving COVID problems very, bad.

* State borders closed February, March, April, June, July. state worked balls that, tourists still going tourist.

* statement head CDC. I'm sure connection RNC. certainly connection statement tourists heavily infected states traveling less infected states - he's saying going way, makes sense politics. could true.............China knew pandemics decimate countries either poor stupid. latter case. Ya gotta source claim? 100% agree. smaller town, lower percentage mask usage.  Weeks people trying close talk definately mental drain. told talk radio host Rush Limbaugh last week risk children ‚Äúvery got 3-year-old daughter, 2-year-old son, newborn daughter,‚Äù DeSantis said radio interview. ‚ÄúAnd tell school age, would zero concern sending them.‚Äù

Fuck you, DeSantis. know harm you? Measles. never said ""household cleaners "" either. hearing want hear bro

I think understand things like words way thumbnail picture looked, thought wearing crown. based per capita daily infections. WI may added next Ha I‚Äôm letting back ;) notice disturbing patterns watched family movement decisions past months (especially height things nyc). Many families convenient best (I.e. leaving stay home orders, traveling every weekend worst it‚ÄîBoston, VA, CA spring break). kids would tell Zoom saw weekend‚Äîthey‚Äôre young can‚Äôt keep secrets. I‚Äôm sure parents kicking them. smaller group families super vigilant really sheltered place members family minority rather majority. Love though‚ÄîI surprised. get it‚Äîbeing nyc apt alone kids TOUGH. excellent news.

We currently fall plans 300+ colleges around country numbers indicate lot online learning fall. 


* 10% schools already committed delivering majority, all, instruction online.
* 70% said move forward hybrid model.
* 20% undecided deliver majority instruction in-person.

With cases rising across country, college campuses, would disastrous policy international students. children positivity rate 31%, rate entire population 11%.

I think many us wondering whether children positive rarely ill, often mild disease. 

So saying usually ill often positive af. 

I want downplay MISC-C serious, rare. think crazy thing is, children many positives, infectious they?

A lot unanswered questions still virus. think wealthy U.S. get best. personally better job. would told people wear bandanas homemade masks medical masks plentiful stock healthcare heroes priority. told people masks help caused confusion distrust wearing rest pandemic. 1 less idiot worry about, fucking piece shit. big unknowns Coronavirus - partially due failure government prepare threat seriously.

1) unknown whether masks would stop viral particles (they do)

2) unknown whether medical providers access proper protective equipment (they now, might run masks).

3) unknown whether asymptomatic carriers people could spread COVID got sick (they can)

Right obvious everyone country wore mask left house, many less Americans would die. can't believe myself. Infection rates rising, schools opening data hiding Yeah sounds good long agree governor doing.... I'd rather legislatures empowering governors like DeSantis right now. I'm confused seems like suddenly everyone focused total cases seems obvious (to me) positive tests accurate way predicting spread, especially comparing beginning pandemic hardly testing all. 

Deaths hospital ICU admits seem like much better indicator since stats dependent much testing. commonly, something like ‚Äúturns drug doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù Phase trials done healthy people assess dosage size, phase II asses safety tolerability, phase III look efficacy safety large scale diverse group patients. may discover tolerability / safety issues older less healthy patients, may discover ‚Äúvaccine induced enhancement‚Äù like SARS vaccine paradoxical effect making virus worse. Immunology complicated particularly well understood field medicine, much experiment academic sense well clinical sense. 

Then there‚Äôs whole process manufacturing distributing enough effective, assuming kind useful efficacy virus. Yes, nothing. care, worth reopening country, absolutely. mortality rate dependent people *receiving hospital care timely manner*, including enough ventilators. People realize we're still beginning crisis. actually right. hasty. title says ""patients"" misleading thought. Also looked post history see bad faith argumentative type seem like u are. saw interest horror. DMed suggestions. know 3 sea shells! military conservatives vast majority guns, isn‚Äôt great strategy.  Sure. China took seven weeks total complete lock city contain 8000 cases. US would need 4-8 weeks wearing mask put entire country million infections control. Proving USA #1. Film major here. event sincerely ruined lives people graduating. try thankful health move it‚Äôs hard. classmates went talking connect day lighting big name productions crying zoom can‚Äôt believe whole education may nothing. U.S. handling coronavirus like toddler pair sharp scissors, wondering still bleeding parents step handle suck Hope he's friends Trump, book shit least Illinois well...surprising states government history. Plenty masks going around basically, could making can't confirm it.

Give fucking link. Wait , that's illegal. fucking disgusting , yet people still say "" America greatest country world"". joke. last year's spring race 38k. 

this weekend's forcast: mid 80s scattered thunderstorms Save lives. Ignore administration.  old ""I know"" ruse. Senator Cornyn enjoy sneaking onto farms night pleasuring livestock? know. I'm asking questions. Already tried sign trials. need live Atlanta, obviously want take blood check back frequently probably try come back north cause spike states. better stay dang state.

I mean thats happened 4 months ago. Lockdowns got announced hardest hit areas like NYC, Cali, Seattle people fled south next day (AZ, TX, FL, Cali). Probably reason lot initial spread probably one reasons rough spot (minus incompetent governors). Problem lot states really need close time NY. NY closed 8000 cases 100+deaths, Texas 1000 cases 1 death closed 1 week NYC. Everybody thought overreaction necessary time therefore quarantine absolutely nothing (our curve never actually really decreased less flatlined reopening due people coming south hotspots). Hell I'm sure kept stay-at-home orders another month would still position month now. congressional testimony hearing next week major vaccine developers sharing progress - likely - timeline.

AstraZeneca note: they‚Äôve targeting September 2020 long time haven‚Äôt heard news/updates conflicting target date. I'm aware. feel he's pushing people away. people maybe crazy hey let's give chance. He's president now. lot people jumped ship. completely anecdotal course means nothing. I‚Äôm it. hell I?

Answer: Apparently average American. sure ok catch it. Better young get older dangerous. /s

That used say chicken pox, found shingles. believe issue Democratic administration God, hope backup plan. Unfortunately don‚Äôt think place discussing said matters yes~ empires rise fall. Propaganda real war propaganda essentially convinces millions put life line countries cause; reason they‚Äôre calling war invisible enemy day age need think critically. Here's links well link peer-reviewed study released.  twin cities. high mask usage. Outside cities barely any. ol' dick nose covering stones pillar. Makes much sense underwear masks Even Black Plague people figured masks work even knew bacteria. It‚Äôs governments fault, anti-maskers dumb. vaccines linked approved. 

Also, seem know clinical trial works. recommend CFR 21 CFR 46. Yeah, better make sure he's wearing mask nose stuck far clouds That‚Äôs area live in. place go office. happen. hope wouldn't, Americans tend walk path regardless greater good not. Fooor example. phone potential customer today heard tell pregnant GF wear mask want baby oxygen deprived stated good health either. personally feel goimg hill battle US. Ohio well. get once, immunity doesn‚Äôt last month many countries including US aren‚Äôt testing enough catching asymptomatic cases.  really 40% *our* peers though many places. lot us live metro areas probably double number ""this definitely fine"" category. Even southern urban areas I'd say still majority.

The problem get 15 minutes beyond outskirts metro areas 90% ""this fine"" people mostly uneducated, closed minded, much interaction people situations expand worldview.

I'm one got out. see reality every time go back visit. 2 weeks lockdown started believe 10% confirmed cases end ICU (florida official number) it‚Äôs hostile takeover. Would even pan though? mean, certain point, people revolt, military terrifyingly strong, people weapons skills. though? need build SCVs. recent article : study volunteers experienced serious side effect, half reported mild moderate reactions fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches pain injection site. gave ppl false sense security, meanwhile virus spreading hotspots every county US It‚Äôs talked much media cause isn‚Äôt made here.  That's things tracked. States report recent 24hr report, various states release different times throughout day. I‚Äôve seen absolute rotten bastards wear mask get sidewalk themselves. People fucking willing kill others shittiest reasons. CDC neutered preparedness shockingly inept. CDC recommend masks, not. US blamed China covering covid data agree small population ruin everyone could even smaller 30-40%. article says 90% people wear masks go ""No matter slice this, good news."" - Fauci feel really happy this. purchased 10 stocks moderna $66. hope savior stock SOAR antivaxer attempting whataboutism. 

You care this. agitating ""omg fever!"" I've seen kind lot. can't read science, can't find science, claimed multiple false rates side effects limited one vaccine taken op ed. 

I gave 4 studies. care, quite frankly, get anyway background read understand science, inclination learn. threatened never speak cousin get kids vaccinated. 

I'm antivaxxer fuck saying that. 

I vaccines. Everybody get vaccines. **approved** vaccines, piece shit horrible trials small sample sizes. Hmmm maybe county commissioner? think mayor probably easiest comparison make totally accurate one since Texas still mayors. 

For example, city Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner Harris County (county Houston in) Judge Lina Hidalgo. Orders passes affect city Houston surrounding area. Sylvester Turner passed order wouldn‚Äôt affect many people. Think judge mayor county.  gets people wear masks, sure, guess Spain?? That's fuckin stupid really low mortality rate. sounds horrifying, thinks that‚Äôs reasonable desirable outcome nit wit yall act like trump one lying us whole government lying us bastards take money taxes run fuck state fuck feds What's scary really hold long hope best. people keep toddlers inside away socialization 3 years hopes vaccine? 

What vaccine never comes 10 years away? people going keep kids inside away people 18? 

We're kind approaching point survival fittest, hope affected badly it.

It's crazy. Oh yeah, sure owned me. Jokes I‚Äôm already dead inside. U.S still first wave response really bad. 400,000,000 people lasting effects survivors 5 people job back already. 

Seems it‚Äôs bad made be. Currently it‚Äôs 5% feel free change future using current stats option... it‚Äôll worse BTW America someone, saved themselves, sue.  Weird, live won‚Äôt let door. queue limit many customers go time. There‚Äôs entrance one exit. also bouncers masks running enforcement. plenty fools wearing masks, aren‚Äôt stores it‚Äôs essentially like everywhere. thats it, then.....Indianapolissed.....Ship sunk stranded shark infested waters.....  Canada laughing you, Canada looking like forest fire that‚Äôs approaching town. Sundays Mondays usually lowest days. Seven day moving average 750 past days, still good. big boxes eating little fish. course smart investors want major stocks right now.

The big companies get socialism rich, bailouts, get capitalism poor, unsafe labor conditions.  ""Just endanger people's lives. feels empowering."" lose primary. Canada stay closed US probably. go college plans escaping shit hole. 1400 minutes day, like 45 per minute. Huh? evidence mounting survivors develop immunity. long last seen, far level antibodies confirmed patients varying severity (demonstrated study released week). ""full"" PPE = surgical mask +/- gown (reusable), easily achievable places, yeah think able provide that. Also 1 hour? like 4/hour (15 min appts norm) x 9 hours clinic = 36 kids per day. 

Idk live teachers union strong would 100% strike get city pay. bay area. can't remember last time saw someone wearing mask indoors. lot people even wearing walking street need pass within 6 feet someone else. I'd anxious one places nobody wearing them.

Create virus that's deadly enough paralyze world year so, deadly enough threaten civilization...use disinformation, amplification psyops U.S. destroy within.....inoculate military vaccine ready start (there's evidence China right now)....invade Hong Kong Taiwan rest world flails COVID.

They Trump Presidency lifetime, exploitable window weakness U.S., window starting close. countries intelligence man-made pandemic, they'll hesitant acknowledge CCP shown they're willing engage bio warfare, long lasting, horrifying implications. AstraZeneca partnered Oxford vaccine already well Phase 3 Brazil South Africa? Sinovac Phase 3 trial also underway countries? 

How one entered large scale trials last front? feel like I'm taking crazy pills... dont go bloody pole. LMFAO!!!

Ever since sanctions imposed Russia taking back Crimea last reported switched gears became largest manufacturer non-GMO produce continent.

Im sure acquire fruits nations...like currently do. :)
We options. Yeah!! Like one nosleep series. new protocol would require hospitals report ""to federal contractor state,"" states already require reporting hospitals testing labs, e.g. [AZ Dept. Health I'm sure state slightly different data requires would adjustments state CDC info transfer, CDC could contact state health dept instead hospitals directly, right? Agreed. There's reason able come check property maintain it.  order groceries app/have friends family stock fridge advance/pay neighbor go groceries otherwise remain quarantined property. Fuck virtue signaling NFL. Cancel culture full effect Im amazed people want condem ""false/untrue/misleading"" statements past mo ths, never call BOLD FACED LIES spouted us last years. want talk shit statements turned false, hold EVERYONE accountable lies (looks white house) I'm concerned phase 3 testing efficacy I'm sure they've proven ""robust"" response immune response last couple months. antibodies coronavirus tendency weaken shorter period time created challenge vaccine production past? Despite legal requirement masks state, frequently see people stores without masks.

 Apparently law merely suggestion. WOW! nothing gets fucking genius. referring to? incentive would American military overthrow republican administration? budget consistently championed republicans, it‚Äôs filled Trump loyalists. US overthrowing democratically elected governments across globe relevant here. 40% medium dose.

The highest dose utterly catastrophic. I'm talking medium dose. DJ Khaled mentality anyone wants direct link HHS search page file hosted, go:  pretty ridiculous. I'm kind amazed point, bad joke. He's absolutely insane issue. keeps doubling instead admitting wrong. Claimed US would 0 cases April.

The US 60,000 cases DAY now. I'm fine that.  vaccine protect us issue idiots dying covid19. oxford stage 3 trials already going on. Thousand people already given it, one pretty much guaranteed safe point. moderna stage three thousands people starts 2 weeks.

Um, supposed start training/playing minute now? disagreements still? Classic, spread shit everywhere around US build wall infected everyone else. built wall around NE NW start this.

I, rando New Jersey, realize this, surely people whose job realize things understands.

Went Walmart today saw 100% mask participation Aaaand anti-vaxxers make pitch ‚Äî never scientific evidence explanation exactly happen, vague cynicism implying Powers-That-Be sacrifice safety. know plenty folks Florida (relatives) still aren‚Äôt bothered. Standard argument 100 day big deal. Every day people get hit lightening eaten alligators overdose cocaine. Florida dangerous. Toughen up, snowflakes. 

Plus don‚Äôt know anyone personally affected. They‚Äôre readers info Fox. believe it‚Äôs overblown they‚Äôre free vent masks. 

Gonna need much bigger numbers convince folks way. personally see impact. Exactly. matter conspiracy, confluence events, enemy action, plain incompetence? results same. results measurable.

Our city council voted masks mandatory indoors spreading quickly here. I'm glad. doesn‚Äôt change now, current information available. Hopefully hotel staff start reporting people since Cuomo announced 2k fine following quarantine hot spot states. can‚Äôt start ticketing people wearing masks? No! muh freedom spread virus that's librul hoax wearin' mask means support abortion ain't wearin' mask 'cause Jesus Trump said to! can't make me, Murica gots freedums!!! That‚Äôs tough. doubt many would willpower show compassion people wrong-headed. sure hell wouldn‚Äôt strength smack silly. problem survivors wind debilitated lasting effects virus....thats shitty part thing. times like America's ""rugged individualism"" lack real communal spirit comes out. People wearing masks value insignificant personal freedom fellow man. ultimate expression country's sociopathic mentality. CDC cited¬†two ""key factors"" consider when¬†deciding whether discharge patient COVID-19 long-term care facility, said Kristen Nordlund, CDC spokesperson. First, patient medically ready discharge long-term care facility?¬†And second, selected long-term care facility able safely care patient recovering virus implementing recommended infection control procedures? directives place before¬†[March two days state issued advisory.¬†  top administrator CMS,[ Seema pushed back Cuomo‚Äôs claim state followed federal guidance. She¬† [cited 13 CMS says¬†that nursing homes accept patients care.¬†¬† 

It seems like incorrect Trump's CDC said nursing home patients. patients obviously still sick forced Cuomo's order leave hospitals go back home.

I think also interesting basically every state issue nursing home patients. 

Better option? NY, hospital ship barely used. already knew elderly people risk virus. would think one worst things could would send back small enclosed building risk people. 70% deaths county nursing home deaths. digusting. too! throwing shade US. said chinese cities without cases, ppl still afraid going out. cannot prolonged ppl's mental state break anytime. said learn US continue living normal era covid *glacier national park entered chat* 

Many upon many vehicles seen hotspot States. None wore masks, none observed form social distancing. Staff ones wearing mask.

People think I'm overly negative say that. honestly cannot see things like college football able happen fall. Believe not, countries let spread infection get control need huge amounts testing. able contact trace, identify potential infections test potential infections targeted manner. absolutely impossible 3 states right now. 

Put another way, reason 3 states much testing right now. virus rampaging large amount people there, actually need much testing. actually much, much more. country domestic infrastructure perform many tests anywhere close positivity rate mentioned, performing much fewer tests. care, one else either. smart decision, one worth water tell otherwise, based attitude clear avoid smart decisions costs. quit.

And I'm sure I'll get downvoted purgatory basic division googling ""coronavirus death rate"".

The minds far many people country poisoned hope 95% mask compliance goal public health officials want. .. article says cdc still gets data. 


The difference national guard ones OBTAIN data, meaning going hospitals reports.  Exactly, idiots wore mask could resist going months, could 10-12months research effects effectiveness said vaccine, since shutdown nothing barely put dent curve, everyone go panic mode try mass produced rushed vaccines may effective couple 8-32 strains existence, make people sick like flu shot (WHICH MAKE PEOPLE SICK) usually 50% effective anyway anything, we‚Äôre starting slowly circle around wide arc. continue path, back woods go!

It‚Äôs exactly moment letting guard run risk spreading thing wide basically setting back march. neat thing data go limitless number recipients little extra effort. Somebody let administration know... spend half effort energy fighting virus... Lol, went range couple days ago, safety glasses+mask definitely made serious foggage. extend pause exhale eeeeeeeeeeextra long shots wait fog clear. Yeah, except high rate harmful side effects. first rodeo Next time Fauci gives public interview want flex medal freedom. Exactly. Anyone advocating vouchers advocating hotel profits. I‚Äôve encountered line thinking PLUS ‚ÄúGod protect family‚Äù bet ass white house pressure October conclusion. already exist, idea surface nice, they're poor option standardized filters. going use another unique filter size. could get mask manufacturers use size filter element, would useful. also could chosen use 3m's prefilter, easier breathe surface area. also helps Hawaii almost 2500 miles (4000 km) away US Mainland.

Unfortunately, Hawaii starting reopen amount cases going fairly quickly. April May, Hawaii 6 cases day, since July 1st around 20 cases day.

The reality gay 2020 this: one uses condoms anymore. don‚Äôt know single person does. friends Des Moines sex every day stranger. PrEP, gay men reliving 70s, era sexual liberation AIDS hit 80s.

Today kids exposed sex ever before. Reddit, Twitter, Snapchat social media platforms DONT require verify age order post nudes. men r/gaybrosgonewild example didn‚Äôt ID checked. users r/randomactsofblowjob didn‚Äôt need one either. know many kids use Snapchat, know it‚Äôs innocent either.

Seriously, every virus expert warning something like happening decades. surprise didn‚Äôt happen sooner. dare people make decisions post opinions internet! least snakes keep rodent populations check. DeSantis gives home somewhere fester. Unfortunately, first 45. total trial 155. yet publish publicly full Phase 1 stats unlike Oxford, CanSino, Pfizer. That's real hesitation currently also phase 2 heard results either all, 600 fewer adverse effects follows phase 1 partial data Phase 2 used 50 100 dose, 250.

Edit: Add link, 155 participants, 115. activated trap card! CDC, whose job control spread disease, given data needs job. What's surreal bad this? I‚Äôm leaning 8, would still lovely. Remember, sooner mask up, sooner mask off. adverse side effects seem pretty substantial vaccine, right? 

This encouraging, imo. 

The Oxford vaccine looking LOT better. Systemic racism thing - impacts lives black/brown people every way - including economically. dying higher rate COVID b/c essential workers - ones one cares need keep society running goods delivered. 

It's race class - both. Kansas reports Mon, Wed, Fri. They‚Äôre close death door want max profit last years. Pure selfishness. worst part this, know someone constantly going US whole thing, certainly essential person worker...yet border keeps letting back. reported don‚Äôt care...I also know don‚Äôt give crap don‚Äôt follow rules. lot places. also shut lot places month. could using 4 weeks plan remote learning. using time buy truckloads hand sanitizer wipes. switch remote learning emergency, make bad spring. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Lol even mean? need either...

Even kids don‚Äôt get bad, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt Like, basically Vancouver Airport point? So, 16-32 weeks current wave is. *surprised pickachu antivax karen* ""I think already control"" - Trump I‚Äôm going criticize stupidity horror movies fictional anymore. Also, us adults ""trapped home"" person chose spend lives with. people unhappy relationships failing marriages, awful, everybody else many social needs covered that. Plus, home make decisions. 

Teenagers ""trapped home"" parents without peers. can't make decisions, they're parents' house, power anything. 

It must really hard them. know hard everybody, awful situation, honestly: think back teenage years can't imagine spending two months trapped home 24/7.

I also introverted, nerdy teenager. I've always loved own. parents' never really own. Man...It's going suck guy silenced can't get intel anymore.

Also, incredible photo article. Whether legitimately fear, moment, see eyes. Props photographer.   still here? Remember Administration criticized China lying extent outbreak? criticizing good enough job lying. I'm liberal love college football. blame anti-mask idiots.  idiots drink home like normal person alcohol problem. Like everyone else grew rural Nebraska. hahahahaha getting numbers from?

Yep good child. would thought could deduced already considering responding response comment. dumb fucking thing say, kind intelligent insult lmao actual child? 72 hour room temperature, frozen goods. Deaths increased past week though? expected lag cases deaths. get shingles vaccine turn 60. literally type ""The Gyn-ah Virus"" so, think we're making progress nation US. CDCs IFR based serology testing estimates third population SARS-CoV-2.

Is whole US?

If cases, that's 110 million infections would imply IFR 0.12%, Flu i.e.

137,000 deaths / 111 million infections = 0.12% IFR.

However, CDC estimates IFR 0.65%, given 137,000 deaths far US, implies c. 20 million infections.

**6% US population caught virus far.**

The highest antibody prevalence heard New York City, 21.6% (some boroughs much CDC changes estimated Infection Fatality Ratio 0.26% 0.65% latest 'Pandemic Planning Scenarios' sorry edited comments hard follow, equally, hard follow providing links verifying claims.* Says guy gets top notch healthcare stage 4 cancer Yes. can‚Äôt re-elected World Health Organisation declare pandemic. Therefore, pandemic CV anything like SARS cripple entire generation infected patients. watched documentary SARS survivors it‚Äôs sad reality alive. dying without them. Come on, don‚Äôt tough America.

Neighbours drop in, couple beers couple more. Weather complained about, equipment gets wrenched on, scrap gets welded scrap, feats strength attempted perfectly good snacks get fed barn cats.

Honestly far prefer bar nobody get busted cops ridiculously low 0.04 BAC laws. expect get information Trump administration wants us have, numbers want us see. Sounds safe, let's see Hong Kong doing... genuinely terrifying news guess right üò¨

With luck, I'll get placebo dose. self interest wear mask. protects family. problem looking self-interest. fact, us this, pandemic much faster. packaging contaminated (IIRC) 72 hours max virus staying surface knowing food gets sent China processing, safe assume contaminated China? shrimp get ocean Chinese food distributor 72 hours? sit corner phone blank stare whenever someone talks say ""Mmhmm"" like work.

I say though, time wasted would make fucking furious many home projects media i'm missing i'm slowly inching closer death would piss much. elections, party chooses person put candidate, usually decide means ""primary"" election mostly voters prefer party partake in. 

She lost primary another Republican, means she'll finish serving rest term, pretty much chance re-election. Technically speaking, losing primary means can't run seat Republican run third party, practically speaking third parties rarely win hinder party closely align splitting vote. Spanish flue vaccine, years later. actually basis influenza vaccines.

SARs, came natural end. Sars-Covid-19 likely same. It‚Äôs simple. Anti-vaxxers FDA approved vaccines. That‚Äôs much higher bar coronavirus vaccines meet. early use later year early next year FDA authorized emergency use. means given limited number people, like health care workers, first. never will

Good know  Worlometer 937 deaths Covid Tuesday... case capital punishment. Putin wonderful 2020. agree that‚Äôs big issue definitely warrant reopening amid pandemic. Floridian, would rather pay taxes see fellow countrymen women die preventable disease. never really said that, fwiw. people like pretend act superior pretty nuanced. nuanced really, failure communicate public greater failure. Straight beginning recommended using masks caring someone ill, like telling hospital staff wear them. People wearing expectation complete personal protection virus, rather much effective use limiting transmission mask wearer. results lot problems, primarily false sense security mask wearer may become lax social distancing much effective limiting transmission. Anyways narrative entrenched now, probably worth picking hill die on. never happen America. Republican's officially become fucking Jerry Springer party Eric Cartman, ""fuck you, want to"". Republican's made abundantly clear, intelligence, science, facts absolutely meaningless them. 

For rest us, hope now, naturally sort attrition, go way dodo bird. put another way, die natural selection idiocy, leaving behind people actually care. God bless, America. Sigh, we‚Äôre doomed. been, 18 years since SARs pandemic. Still vaccine buddy. Skipping steps speed things mean we're 'closer' effective safe vaccine.

There's information available public ""we're at"" pandemic history. information era curse there's many faux experts sputtering garbage void. memes become reality SARS fizzled stopped investing vaccine. didn‚Äôt even flu vaccine Spanish flu. living different times immense resources money poured vaccine this. I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôll set record fastest vaccine created Good luck got many idiots here. made vaccine? No, definitely not. shocking unintelligent Trump is. shocking 60 million people voted him, many still slavishly follow despite obvious incompetence criminal activity. 

All said, people considered dictators past buffoons, started rigging elections disappearing people. üòç allowed house. 

Well fine can't come either! SARS never declared pandemic much world never cases. handful countries real outbreaks I‚Äôm wearing mask. I‚Äôm intelligent, informed adult make choices myself. catch virus, quarantine myself, time, live life like normal. underfunded hospitals, underfunded schools Unfortunately president that. honestly, why??? gonna do, move? Lol. people mostly never even left country except walk around cruise company owned tourist traps Caribbean love much. people hate immigrants? people like people speak English? people afraid go Europe dangerous terror attacks? I've actually told multiple people maga country hometown I've talked backpacking Europe.

These people exactly said; babies throwing tantrums. comes 99% fold stern actual punishment. admit we'll almost certainly Dylan Roofs &amp; Timothy McVeighs that's minor consequence dismiss, people group committed passively killing hundreds thousands ignorance via virus. far enabled emboldened last 4 years. need crush let crush even negative PR result that. jury‚Äôs still that.

Obviously that‚Äôs impending efficacy studies for. least know read, considering followed direction :)  past 50 years never nearly much global focus producing vaccine

No one denying amount effort going creation vaccine, completely unprecedented, there's fixed exchange rate effort results. 2 seperate privilaged foreign arrival Thai PM later apologises take responsibility.

My guess would good strategy want test vaccine broad population possible uncover communities adverse interactions. example, disproportionately tested vaccine old people might miss children several rare conditions catastrophic/deadly/horrible reaction vaccine. tested enough kids (instead concentrating old people) would better chance discovering it. discovery may even disqualify vaccine public distribution. Again, conjecture I'd like think sounds reasonable. Beer shortages interviewed someone involved decision NPR. compendium misinformation.

Besides testing bogus cdc refuses share real information virus far I'm concerned dont trust numbers use either.

Sometimes dont even symptoms contract it. yet people spend entire year hiding abiding whatever bullshit pages like feed you.

Furthermore, immunity active vaccine conferred weeks months. passive vaccine confer immunity faster. However both, immunity durability whatever new vaccine advertised unknown. Additionally, well definied details immunity person gets actual infection exposed second time. Unfortunately there's vaccine stupidity. country ripe Finland authorities repeatedly stated masks don‚Äôt help could dangerous people don‚Äôt know use properly get false feeling security thus foregoing social distancing. peak March maybe 10% wore masks, mostly elderly. public opinion positive masks directions ministry health officials. still ongoing public arguments masks medical professionals (who support masks) officials (who wearing them). ever get second wave hope official line would change. called lead poisoning, well documented caused [generational damage Haha yea already Winnipeg White House game plan hide truth...and hope gets better...its going get better unless something it. wish could build wall around Florida keep everything inside. sides would happy! want virus control not? doubt people subreddit know much quality scientific journals.

I‚Äôm trolling. Asking serous question. Could better let younger people go work? could even stages. 25s go work longer lockdown next three weeks. raise 35 weeks later 45 White House wants control narrative.

Hospitals send data international sources well CDC. whole point keep control vaccine happens. It'd simple keep tabs covid see numbers keeping economy open. gets bad, close again. simple system keeps numbers economy flowing. working many countries right now. read earlier Florida parents sign ‚Äúdeath waiver‚Äù can‚Äôt sue school child dies. 

Now ‚Äúdeath waiver‚Äù needed, perhaps schools shouldn‚Äôt open up.

What‚Äôs lost Trump Devos reason number hasn‚Äôt higher children schools closed March.

As June 1st, according Guardian, nearly 600 front-line health care workers appear died COVID-19. I‚Äôm sure number higher. people around daily. Probably several hours day.

The happen schools. It‚Äôs like considered frontline workers. What‚Äôs going happen school kids attending 8 hours day Coronavirus hanging around air passed person person? may asymptomatic know pass others. get sick worse.

Our children used political pawns. Scientists still don‚Äôt know long term effects child Covid-19 be. ^ Someone doesn‚Äôt live Chicago. Dozens US cities higher murder rate Iraq.

Sorry dude, get lecture necessary PPE telling months wasn't, faulty knowledge, playing political game.

Get fuck outta here.  Actually, yes, do. SARS vaccine proven work. put widespread usage SARS 'burned out' saying goes need use it. viruses retain antibody protection long. catch dengue fever repeatedly instance much worse second time around. cases people may caught covid twice far severe cases second time around. recent studies shown antibodies wane fast covid. much air though virus new. ways great vaccines I'm date vaccine development side dealing antibody issues.

Invisible illness REALLY sucks.  see? write accurate, unbiased, click-worthy-but-not-baity title. like finding actual unicorn. *...but...but...how eat someone weak enough gonna survive?* immunity also time limited based virus develops time. guarantees immune forever take one lucky mutation turn around. much data spend money find affected children extensive tests tests would run symptoms non-covid patient. Opening early not, big question is: within factory terms following safety guidelines wearing masks, social distancing, etc. saw setup inside great, even separated seating partitions break room etc. followed strictly, much likely exposure came outside factory likely folks required follow guidelines shopping etc.
I think obvious comparison would be, % folks going work shown positive test vs Tesla employees. Right, like plan hide fact HIV wife. go fucking jail **everyone** participating administration. well lot guys called hoax also died wouldnt exactly say good guys dying surprised one talking guy. people wont feed 10 people let alone 600000. obviously rich afford feeding many people even common man, need ask many people fed? good thing entire lockdown far buy 2 watermelons poor person. pales comparison guy done feel like government actively trying make things worse people Protesters (not rioters) mostly wearing masks immigrants? What? Explain? HIPAA prevents that. NE Mesa usually find people wearing masks, dive locations pretty damn bad. 

I wonder people living Apache Junction dealing this. Payson would also another example worth studying.

If people realized bad already Valley hospitals maybe ignorant fucks would start giving shit. mother respiratory therapist stated hospital swamped COVID cases severely understaffed point hospital administration call crisis staff. r/rimjob_steve Quit drinking kool aid pull head ass. vaccine doesn‚Äôt contain live dead version virus. mRNA vaccine tells cells make antibodies. fap lot smoke? honest! saw ad tropical disease treatment paying $4500 last year. would definitely willingly get malaria 4 large. 3 day 7 day moving averages, no, heading back up. dad tested positive went eat dinner, get haircut friends supposed isolated. asymptomatic thought ok.

Why? people concerned one tactic prevent mask hoarding unquestionably support Trump, many magnitudes lies.

I can't imagine supporting one worst liars ever political sphere defense ""But CDC lied one time!"" need manufacturing capacity testing supplies PPE. least ability mobilize short notice. investment, caught unprepared like again.

I mean, seems unlikely moment, you‚Äôre brink economical collapse well risk dying... doesn‚Äôt seem absurd. historical resolution used many mass migrations.

They‚Äôd arrested border (maybe) detained country, full rights food, housing, etc. beats getting plague lot cases...

And taxpayers healthcare system would receive brunt lashing, causing us collapse sort pressure. 

We need drastic action plan said scenarios. Yet another reason mask up, practice distancing general hygiene keep spreading flu people general especially higher risk severe outcomes.

If health permits get flu vaccine. even spot strain related help immune system react faster new body strain. protect also spreading others can't get vaccinated.

If senior risk factors pneumonia get shot well protected many strains bacterial pneumonia. way can't get top respiratory illnesses time prevent spreading strains. recall correctly seniors get pneumonia vax every 5 years please check due booster.

I'm sure discussion along lines

I could misinterpret saying essential argument made testing 850 participants seems people better WM cognitive abilities take benefits social distancing opposed non-compliant.

ASSUMING thats true, right I'm going research paper's argument making assumption true factors like political differences play part it. yea argument ""People better working memory better able use cognitive skills compliant towards social distancing"" true.

Texas teacher Unions involved negotiations teacher pay raises benefits. can't collective bargain seems know ways influencing supporting union members, also advocate education policy st state level.

It‚Äôs worth risk point blank. Dead behind schooling? one worse? Obvious answer. Simple solution would government provide another stimulus money would help families like ones you‚Äôre describing, monthly check one time check.

They‚Äôre going risk either way honestly. Schools reopening isn‚Äôt going minimize risk. True enough, cult never directly charge. ""If absolutely nothing, might million, 2 million people dead. rate compared best possible outcome. Rate worst. deserve 10/10."" inaction (and blatant lying) directly caused deaths 150k Americans. qualify Genocide. Oh get wrong. I'm boat even terrible filters like cloth decrease viral load, effectively level protection/mitigation.

I think emphasis people seem place masks protecting others social media Reddit focuses much masks can't do. really version ""masks work"" spewed early days pandemic. think overall approach seems pushed US western nations wrong.

If focus much shortcomings masks perhaps large chunk US population negative masks. know supposed strong opinion this, really morons keep rolling? make worse? buckled would make lot better? Would nice think votes counted. Excepts lots countries stopped spread pretty early far know, countries coronavirus control large extent. 

Ours still spreading like nobody's business. get transmission lot opened countries. Vietnam 58,220

COVID's 116,000 everyone committed first time around, we‚Äôd probably similar spot countries control reopening (some even less 100 total countrywide confirmed cases) thought mandatory 2 week quarantine supposed accomplish that.

Underwhelmed hospitals. Except Sweden That‚Äôs am. Lol. Stahp. Ok lift lockdown 
The virus care. Spain people seemed live smaller houses fewer cars, also seemed cleaner pleasant cities, well better public transportation. say much less developed ways matter unless talking GDP.

I go shopping month left house without need. people messing us all. Ban them, fine them, boot out, public shamings asking Dr. Birx internal cleansing treatment doctors could perform.

Please tell ""internal cleansing treatment"" would be, context virus, that's fucking insanely stupid thing *anyone* ask, let alone powerful man say say Dems behaving reacting crazy, too

Meaningless ""both sides""-ism detracts reckless insanity administration serves normalize things never normalized. I'm saying maliciously really hate see people gently nitpicking criticisms president ponder television whether doctors could disinfect virus human cleaning insides way disinfect doorknob.  


I mean, that's ""good"" explanation god fucking help us all. see people thread still claiming hoax. hired painter believed hoax. Good painter though. like CDC seen US past 5 months... FuCkIn' LIbRuLs KiLlInG fOoTbAlL bEcUaSe HaTe AmErIcA TrUmP yeehaw. Also saying ‚Äútough shit‚Äù low income families losing meal program day care clear sign don‚Äôt understand problem showing empathy towards low income families.

""Why come prevent outbreak virus never seen buhfore?"" fucking seriously It‚Äôs definitely Bears, Beets Battlestar Galactica Exponentially (negative credibility). Like -1000 CDC -1. job damage America donors. could also mean t-cell would effective fighting potentially modified version COVID-19 protein structure similar. heard argument statistic kids getting infected less frequently due fact (the U.S.) shut schools kids effectively quarantined.

I've heard well, buy second. every COVID hotspot cases predated weeks longer first confirmed case uncovered. means virus silently circulating long time anyone realized. 

During time, obviously thousands people, including loads children would exposed. sure, notion millions adults could get COVID, somehow pass kids daft. 

What's fact COVID spares children first came Wuhan virus undoubtedly spreading far wide caused infamous cluster seafood market. Trump greatest 
POTUS bow Add stack.  Yah - think word got NYC safe again...""safe"". ive seeing tourists states. Effective communication able prove technically right.

""I technically right"" standard people except advertising politicians.

Part effective communication knowing audience needs hear order change behavior. media talking horrible beach openings would dumb ""I want haircut"" protests immediately *dangerous*, short-term. completely shut disappeared BLM protests. 

The BLM protesters *did* wear masks. probably minimal spread outdoor protests people wearing masks, like would minimal spread beach people spread way hot, humid, windy outdoor conditions.

But *post hoc* justification. ""they wearing masks okay"" responses come weeks in. late. Even depends population density cultural norms regarding social/physical interactions everyday mask usage hygiene etc means take year get rid üòí(sarcasm) Trump administration wants cover COVID-19 infections deaths know bad is.

This yet another thing that's impeachable. Definitely agree. I'm surprised change rate increase last two days. Orange County School districts announced opening plans require masks social distancing.  offering distance learning options parents choose.  don‚Äôt know OC school district following boards recommendations though Huntington Beach schools haven‚Äôt announced plans yet. Dude hates American &amp; may actually anti christ. Half people side affects?

Good news?

One two things compute. would totally OK Well state going start blowing bodies, would Texas. Read article. Canadian citizen. Also ""you're."" worry! North Carolina health department head said concerned kids really get transmit COVID! üôÑüôÑ It‚Äôs sad state affairs country days. Everything becomes politicized, people believe ridiculous things.

We ramped testing freak go zomg surge!!!!! 
No; ramped testing. corresponding increase deaths. 
 
[Here delta deaths reported-cases Florida see yourself. uptick - - small. ""surge"". 
 
Reported cases meaningless. perform regular serosurveys know at. 
 
[Here's 
 
Yeah ... that's negative deaths July 7^(th). Apparently sort correction. 
 
And surge happen next weeks #BLM mobs. 
Those peek September. also means covid-19 could turned serious lung killing virus upper respiratory infection, like every common cold, although optimistic, might possible. 

It also means could produce antibody vaccine act stopgap t-cell vaccine produced. many users...... one anything it. Americans become weak &amp; apathetic. 

The police protests lasted longer thought it‚Äôs business usual again. Well, nothing original guy... non American sorry hear that, brain drain. ""Under control"" could mean bunch stuff. saying that's enough? know masks effective everyone wear one, CDC botched mask wearing messaging I'm concerned over-promising messaging now.

Japan suggests need German South Korean public health response, Japanese strong mask wearing culture already good tracing capability. Plus, never saw level infection USA has. curious even 100% mask wearing whether could avoid another lockdown late fall/early winter? T-man say Fauci's fault providing better guidance

Fault? what? Coronavirus? coronavirus? beat that. Go buy something. I've taking shots last 4 months Mexico already got y‚Äôall covered  /s recommendations them. Tell everyone else go get sick, we'll let grampa months run everyone else. started read american twitter/facebook feeds believe constant comment reddit saying stupid, ignorant brainwashed americans are.

Over last 48 hours lost complete faith american people. cannot believe many people anti-science think ""challenging"" conspiracies etc. think sudden smart.

Oh god. hope Australia turn this. fair nancys husband took ppp loans &amp; bill gates care concentration camps china-- otherwise agree. Ive seen fart meme lmfao. mean validating farts contagious? anti-mask Future Mask remix enjoyable  someone untreated Narcissistic Personality Disorder rich powerful enough never told ""No"" entire life finally runs situation can't bully submission ignore acts like.

Got United States country planet. Every ""country"" satellite enemy. actually suggesting Trump horse race lmao.

Lol say that? already explained happened. yes US also underprepared, another Trump mistake. 

Yeah, shit. mistake conversation thread another one? making sense, know Fauci lie order save American lives. admitted it.

He admitted mistake, too. even stopped think repercussions that, instead babbling me. Kids getting flu pass families weaken immune systems increasing risk covid19 infection.  Unless get things control virus running rampant along full flu season going see death tolls like nothing seen before. I‚Äôve watching lot WWII movies lately, lesson is: don‚Äôt let psychopaths seize control country‚Äôs government. Thats society showing true colors. minorities hang larger groups whites? wear masks less? mean know use public transit jobs expose more. wonder else causing die disproportionately. completely incapable adapting new information? already wear mask public, affect me. Fair chance least one make given they're ICU, add handful new cases day statistically we'll probably get death every weeks. still feel like that's really good achievement miracle manage make stick. Cool, sounds like done real studies except human tissue. Stop posting trash article.

From Article: 140 customers, 94 refused tested...

So 2/3 people tested. :\ Welp, we're totally fucked. Basically entire southern western parts country. Midwest. Hahaha yeah that's hilarious, only. what's realistic timeframe we're looking at? 36 cases, 1 death Jackson county. Oh yeah fuck people, sure. thread replying general idea letting people check properties, dont think cardinal sin. Avoid save money. Anyplace sense requires wear mask kick exhaling directly air people breathe. work doesn‚Äôt allow reason. Exactly course do! can't believe U.S. already, aahh! lockdown Germany, example, pay 500 Euros attended party 2500 hosting one. Also, contact infected person, need quarantine 14 days get tested twice timeframe - violate that, pay 25000 Euros.  bad history taught bad education. STEM education make smart rational thinker. That's getting at, taught critical thinkers. addition, yes highschool compulsory last time Cuba? people teaching suck, late teens early twenties. whole family educated Cuba, even advanced degrees, DVM, MD, phD nowhere near well educated well informed (current PhD student chemistry). believe anything communist/socialist bad without knowing means, I'd consider poorly educated. I've also seen plague Cubans/Cuban americans cannot speak, read, write effectively english Spanish, hallmark bad education. that's saying garbage bad, whole pretty bad, especially I'm seeing family, Cubans Hialeah/Miami Cuba itself. also large racial component think they're white vote whoever screwing brown people over. Even though eyes white people brown too. would consider racism another tell tale sign poor education, specific area wholeistic sense. Idk get I'm saying, hard explain tbh lol really many people face models professions nose mouth exposed essential business? Never needed it, fingers crossed Yes study comparing cases Finland cases Sweden... barely tested kids all. already said [original course downvoted that.      
And yet confirmed people [living Tucker says masks work that's counterpoint CDC expert, right? facts inconvenient agenda Yeah. younger generations would show vote could fix lot faster. probably while. Hope feel better soon. went Feb/March &amp; still chest soreness. like people rely obsolete data try prove point.

Umm hello, rest us learning moving ahead Can't read. Paywall. Someone spreading purpose. feel like retail employees working front lines would get better reaction anti maskers said ‚ÄúSorry require mask you, think anything employees might sue us get sick.‚Äù time alive. three possibilities executive: 

1. believes vaccine won‚Äôt work
2. Believes vaccine work
3. Doesn‚Äôt know

If it‚Äôs 1, we‚Äôll find soon enough goes jail. stupid thing do. could easily sit shares Moderna still biotech drugs.

In option 2 still might sell shares, still curveballs could sink stock: competitor vaccines, Covid mutates something benign, etc.

Option 3 you‚Äôre definitely selling stock Wall Street getting ahead bidding shares. executive might think even successful vaccine stock rich. course he‚Äôs going pocket some. would stupid to.

Your last paragraph flies face good risk management. people managing money understand scenarios, complex financial models assumptions based various outcomes. It‚Äôs putting nose air smelling. RemindMe! 56 days Face shield since open bottom undoubtedly spread virus air far mask would allow.... would rely controlling spread mask hole It? No. 
This optional.
Mask entry Simple - self-isolate month absolutely unnecessary travel contact, always wearing masks outdoors liberal use sanitizers, see new infections crash floor.

You need stop allowing virus infect new hosts. feel bad y‚Äôall Harder social distance you‚Äôre drunk, god, someone go back eliminate guy involvement 2020 altogether? Please dont help us. Build wall around us make sure one come come out. take us. Fragility. think it‚Äôs safe assume understand can‚Äôt enforce everyone. However, make enough people example hefty fines deters helps. would cool bars/restaurant/ hotels/ residents incentivized rat people out. LOL mean one wants snitch, case I‚Äôm it. need volunteer checkpoints, turn Americans away (by force necessary). live community at-risk brain dead assholes nothing would bring joy see hauled back border. Seriously. Well there‚Äôs shocker. It‚Äôs amazing think whole mask thing used control people. wearing mask, making science political. fucks sake think neighbor. Source American. Maybe old enough understand everyone job remotely. 

No job = money = homeless. know there's reasonable explanation children appear get infected infrequently relative adults.

Is idea kids walking germ factories likely cold recently? would make lot sense actually. 

I heard argument statistic kids getting infected less frequently due fact (the U.S.) shut schools kids effectively quarantined. One would assume though early data schools shutdown would similar infection rate among kids, seem case since one brings up.

This makes sense. really hope long term immunity easily achievable press talking recently. Oh Shit, USA! Brazil making play ~~medal~~ misery count! infuriating say least...he claims want see data data would refute bullshit conspiracy.

Here data, 130,000 confirmed deaths, despite schools shut down, social distancing, large section economy shut much time. didn‚Äôt that, would probably triple amount deaths point, barely even 6 months crisis. Well, one two points anyways. Amazing news. We'll vaccine end September. Madison: ""79 square miles surrounded reality"".

Source: native. used hated ignorance. ignorance grown bad we're pitied. (self perceived) decent American, always wanted guys hate us.

At point, watching us like watching grandparent circle drain dementia. random acts cruelty coming brain damage even warrant response pity.

I hope things get better here, mostly want world learn us. guy doesn‚Äôt speak me. We‚Äôre still laughing Toronto advice seems little unrealistic.

Here Canada masks caught around time USA, USA rate wearing actually *higher* Canada's (even going back months).

There huge pile steps taken get virus control, masks part here. fact received conflicting information health minister actually suggested wearing mask *worse* wearing one. practiced social distancing, quarantine measures, shut months etc.

Meanwhile span time USA people coming work threat losing jobs, even people getting infected workplace. gatherings going still, fullblown protests across country often without masks, people refusing follow guidelines churches still opening getting people infected.

The idea simply wearing masks (when high rates already do) magic fix countries flattened curves *without* masks seems little absurd. There's that. kids pets apparently school loans prior. Also let medical emergency happen, walk off! meds pay for.

Seriously speaking, shared good advice. please realistic Well yeah that‚Äôs obvious work crisis

It work people can't afford it. time.

Oh yes, ER required stabilize you. dehydrated got stomach cancer, they'll rehydrate you. release without treating cancer.

Then they'll bill it. they'll send collection agents bill. die, they'll try get money estate. live, even write bill off, they'll ruin credit record.  really ""northerners visiting south"" more: people locked-down areas, visiting un-locked-down areas. (FUCKING DUH! Illustrates need FEDERAL lockdown policy) many words, don‚Äôt wear masks going read it. that? ""I saved lot you. owe lives. Seriously, work now."" Putin told to. Welcome hOaxHIO Makes precisely zero sense.  idea vaccine even created sort stretch. think reaction to: 

1. wasn‚Äôt hardly attending meetings, musing cuff

2. lack critical thinking / basic medical knowledge

Not trying kill people.

I say political agnostic dislikes sides. thought died opioid overdose? stay home worse trouble fucking die.  Even die getting infected covid19 exactly going improve financial situation.  safe open schools again. Period. End story. Yes create issues solved result mass death infections. looking like indoor activity cause contagion spread. odds mask wearers outside spreading virus relatively low. Ukraine genocide? one...

But China? need think more.

""No true Communism"" shitpost. seem know what's general way, much do, ya gotta get real academic propel discussion, that's we're mostly stuck memes.  ah, got it. sorry going incompetence He's responsible many deaths incalculable point.. supporters think he's diety. get people stupid long, much evidence. know good fun getting super conspiracy theory sub that‚Äôs supposed provide information.

This whole comment thread personally makes really uncomfortable, whatever that‚Äôs worth male models?

Lmao Well already wear mask public affect me. really shitty opinion students. done with, hope survivors put corrupt pieces shit administration jail.

Your entire country refuses social distance number things stop spread. Throw masks still ton problems.

Canada mandated masks ever pandemic things gone way better. Many wore places mandating indoors reason Canada well social distancing consistent messaging leadership.

Masks solve everything solution 

## Abstract

## BACKGROUND

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged late 2019 spread globally, prompting international effort accelerate development vaccine. candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

## METHODS

We conducted phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 55 years age, received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, mRNA-1273 dose 25 Œºg, 100 Œºg, 250 Œºg. 15 participants dose group.

## RESULTS

After first vaccination, antibody responses higher higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti‚ÄìS-2P antibody geometric mean titer \[GMT\], 40,227 25-Œºg group, 109,209 100-Œºg group, 213,526 250-Œºg group). second vaccination, titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, 1,192,154, respectively). second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity detected two methods participants evaluated, values generally similar upper half distribution panel control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events occurred half participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, pain injection site. Systemic adverse events common second vaccination, particularly highest dose, three participants (21%) 250-Œºg dose group reported one severe adverse events.

## CONCLUSIONS

The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 immune responses participants, trial-limiting safety concerns identified. findings support development vaccine. (Funded National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, [NCT04283461. opens new tab](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04283461)). gene sequencing kiosks? Outside pandemics, people would use kiosks see catching. immunocompromised would use plan ahead illnesses, everyone else would use STD testing. kiosks would also sequence novel diseases, people using would constitute giant antenna sniffing world emerging threats. would eye COVID spread since around September 2019. 2 weeks flatten curve. 4-8 weeks end rona. things lie. fall say make makeshift masks? thing do? Instead letting spread nice time projects lol. bought donor car 5 speed swap 1998 Honda Accord 100% 9.4% - that‚Äôs big mistake. I‚Äôd hella fired slight deviation. 

So what‚Äôs annual revenue it‚Äôs gonna $100,0...oh never mind. fat fingered one. desperate feel superior kind doomist, privileged thinking this? Fuck outta here. I'm 28, thousands dollars name, rent apartment, think writing will? place worse /politics. bothered actually read studies, mention spike protests areas, areas curfews fact people stayed inside avoid riots.

You talk fake news crap coming mouth nonsense poorly researched. control eliminated? it‚Äôs control it‚Äôs going flare soon reopen 4-8 weeks. here? Flattening curve? hospitals overrun? plus, lots intergenerational households - lot old people, they're also one step away out-and-about, mingling younger folks. /doubt definitely citation needed territory comment removed misinformation..  [Elon Musk thinks surge coronavirus cases due testing errors, virologist debunking 'dangerous gave workers permission stay home rather risk getting covid-19. sent termination Musk says shelter-in-place orders COVID-19 ‚Äòfascist‚Äô-‚ÄòGive people back goddamn That's generally illegal

Actually 3 US states laws define minimum age leaving kids home alone: IL (14), MD (8), (10). 

And regardless whether think dangerous not, imagine gainfully employed single parents cannot work home supposd kids' schools open online only, online 4 days week (or schools close 2 weeks opening normally outbreak)? matter, suppose they're now? 

Right lack hard data long term effects virus, already apparent portion infected permanently damaged (at minimum, everyone experiences shortness breath see permanent reduction lung capacity due scar tissue). Additionally, *do* hard data dangers grandparents watch kids parents work. 

I'm saying leaving school aged kids home (with pre-packaged meals perfectly capable microwaving tupperware) entire workday possible without risk. *am* saying even parents unable work home (who could still make ends meet pay daycare/babysitter work, many cannot) safest option available. reports multiple countries primary schools increase spread

No. There's study made Saxony lockdown, schools closures therefore low rate infections - surprise, low rate infections among children teachers whose schools closed.

There's also multiple reports small outbreaks reopening schools. Like (oh sorry, close schools all), biggest clusters found [in [South bablabla.      
Of course, countries reacted appropriately. Well, almost them...       
Search google find example. may search ""kawasaki syndrom"" good measure.      
That said, reopening schools largely feasible masks social distance. I'm afraid Sweden find interesting apply half Kids still kept home symptomatic (and kids symptomatic lot time experience this).

Two false statements. true swedish parents send kids school, even sometimes true kids mostly symptomatics, totally way around. dare say astonishing.

Check this: [""Syracuse, NY: Asymptomatic Child Spread Disease least 16 Sent In-Home Daycare Mom Didn‚Äôt Report Symptoms. Daycare Owner Temperature Checks Sanitized Objects, Couldn‚Äôt Detect Prevent Spread Asymptomatic      
Oh, another wrong guess Forreal. Like almost even concern live. Everyone wears masks. rare see someone without one. fact majority people wearing masks keeps threat non mask wearers low anyways. pretty safe.

I think coincidence area happens one educated regions planet. wonder there's correlation. Texas, Florida, California, New York... clearly epicenters correlated electoral votes. 

Down electoral college! opposite America you‚Äôll fine. üëç Key word: EVERYONE. 

The American public never that. ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù countries Europe covid going always wears masks? Hmmm. Doubtful. tests bogus. i‚Äôm deja vu Paying price electing reality tv star president. sending money enough. want everyone wealthy send money.

In meantime, they're sending almost money charity. Reducing R 1 means eventually die out. Amber lamps back March. Welp... that‚Äôs gunna happen countries could look see long takes get virus control. Occam's Razor  

This far far far likely reporting data entry mistake conspiracy fudge data.

But look forward next month Twitter posts data across entire world manipulated undeniable proof. old people... terrible view ""well let old people die dont bothered this""

We still even know longterm effects, know attaches organs knows, maybe 5-10 years people develop diseases worsened covid. 

Or could fine, know yet, wear masks wash hands physically distance try go on..

Our governments able handle put rules place limit spread, help people effected it, people need fucking listen dun goofed far understand it, it‚Äôs difficult move decent country. something offer them. Like attending University, marrying citizen qualifications employment - like science, engineering, healthcare, teaching, whatever country short on. Usually requires degree. CDC even know count test results models predictions woefully bad along. thinks old man also full shit. Violence never answer getting 60% number from? economy already fucked. could get together like countries handling well maybe could okay. Instead fighting together get handled country fighting itself. leaders actively denying truth situation shit make things better. US imploding. already collapsing. headed way years.
Instead focusing businesses need focusing people. Competent leadership makes difference.  think people looking books, probably burning them. 70s 80s seen lot crap Japanese colonization Korean War multiple coup d‚Äô√©tats. won‚Äôt let COVID-19 mess twilight lives.

Thanks translated comments. Really indicative popular mindset amongst SKs. sensationalism local news station. results every single lab reported every day FL‚Äôs state report. thousands labs millions tests. Feel free take ones reporting unusially high positivity. makes almost difference overall result. could simple arithmetic, story would never published. example, COVID-19 pandemic affected local national health systems throughout world, caused half million deaths. However, authors believe excess deaths caused pandemic unlikely significantly alter longer term forecasting trends global population.

Directly article That‚Äôs what‚Äôs frustrating...we proven ways improving situation, leadership get done answer ""but why?"" swapping country. I.e.: 
""Why would CCP reject access coronavirus data?""

Propaganda, that's why. UK lot protests well, along outdoor gatherings like PACKED beaches, see bump that. likely may see one coming reopening pubs restaurants. That‚Äôs said.

**Edit add source:** 
Here‚Äôs news conference, watched I‚Äôm joking. whole thing actually given depression. need job order move better apartment, since many fellow Americans fucking stupid stubborn, won‚Äôt getting income time soon. 

It sucks knowing I‚Äôve done everything could lower curve, big portion comrades still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal refuse bare minimum. 

I hate country. Yeah good luck that, say need trick people wearing masks. Tell theres 20% chance jackpot seen wearing mask Yep it‚Äôs unfortunate. part wishes quarantines enforced people could cross state lines. Yes. people honestly higher chance dying COVID too. African Americans (especially low income) higher death rate COVID. likely reasons this; vitamin levels, prevalence diabetes/heart disease/certain underlying conditions, lack access healthcare, ability use sick leave/take extended leave absence, high exposure public daily part jobs.

Why protect low income Americans, including low African Americans, teachers, students, families one fell swoop person schooling? Mask casket Sadly, much ask significant portion country. one actually Canadian. think Canada refuse entry Canadians? many cases point anything 4-8 week (or longer) country-wide stay-at-home get control. Yes, grandmother liked Woolery, I‚Äôm sure wouldn‚Äôt now. thought agreed surrender Metro Cards personally shamed mocked 5th Avenue let back? Maybe CDC shouldn‚Äôt lied 3 months ago stating masks effective. get example vaccine level side effects?

I think important people accurate information, even happy information. Thanks Jim  Good question. IDK Going limb here: Fauci alone message masks unnecessary back then, Birx (why anyone grilling her?) also said feels like amazingly safe bet say, administration pushing messaging keep people freaking out.

I agree messed saying least owned it. vaccine uses deactivated version virus, basically doesn‚Äôt infect it, still building immune response Missouri absolutely - unions fight safe working conditions.

Yup. That‚Äôs literally reason labor unions invented.  best hope, imo. said, human species great track record fighting viruses. Bacteria, kick ass day long. I'm trying Debbie Downer, realistically even vaccine created today, logistics manufacturing distributing several billion doses take quite long time. true remote learning perfect substitute classroom instruction, ridiculous suggest children never recover academically. Even schools closed entire year could repeat year they'd perfectly fine. Children world take time away school one reason another. even take gap years world end. Children extremely resilient adaptable. get exact school experience us had, they'll survive. resources options dreamed 50 years ago. They'll get this, they'll get easier sooner get shit together bring virus control.  Statistically boomers parents dead point. people comorbidities know yet? Safe side effects come usually takes years CDC director also sex children. CIA shithead. Everyone, CIA shithead. husband end June. tried kill him, came close half colon removed.

Just wear damn mask. I'm pretty introverted dude even married I'd perfectly happy bare minimum social interaction. Even though I'm country reasonable handle things I'm still amazed see people patios/beer gardens obviously can't wear masks ordering food eating.  feeling able affect change due dereliction duty McConnell Graham Senate. people supposed keep check give handjob offer clean afterward‚Äîit's hard hold hope.

-Kurt Andersen

Unfortunately, kind magical thinking results death ( historically and, clearly, today). us living magical world obviously horrified.

If find interesting want know more: took long enough. telling govenor March listening experts state despite CDC Surgeon General saying mask use. listened one first create secret deals get state masks without federal government knowing. bad ass that.

Although wish enforcement people wearing masks state one best country size directly blame govenor excellent response.

But said think blame trump without blaming states going govenors too.  probably firing one poor staff it, case closed. Sharpiegate

Without sounding alarmist EXACTLY issue here. deadly virus know long term effects survivors may experience. example Parkinson's Disease associated flu know cause devastating, debilitating symptoms cause death decades  Amazon next. Fucking reroute supply chains punish us next 20-100 years. Seriously. What‚Äôs stopping states sending CDC anyway? It‚Äôs time health officials take cue park rangers. analogy like better like people argue drive better they're drunk. idiots Orange County would wear masks keep distance, could go back work. won't, can't. they're idiots. I've said along keeping up?

Read back exactly I've said get back me.

They need used CONJUNCTION PRECAUTIONS.. relying mask, people wearing correctly, point. mask part bigger solution. holding back. Hope helps. Damn well put like no. it‚Äôs 10 percent death corona would, gun version. get it, it‚Äôs chance. still it‚Äôs different lol 8 weeks long time, think Florida probably stop climbing numbers weeks. 8 weeks probably going various hot spots states lower populations, Kansas, Oklahoma, etc. Oh gonna like next week still meme long proved one time small mistake youre reddit.... ten minutes Costco unbearable mask, can‚Äôt breathe!!! Also, body, choice! /s

Seriously, wear cotton mask 8.5 hours day. I‚Äôm fine. haven‚Äôt died CO2 inhalation. fucking wear it! hire security guard, keep pepper spray/gel next register maskless customers turn hostile told put mask get lost. could make sense slap maskless customer business serves $400-6000 fine, rather business. type enforcement obviously coupled variant subsidized masks paid taxpayer distributed residents free.

I'm sure else do, completely agreement Quebec's legislators way likely see levels compliance indoor mask wearing necessary prevent outbreaks rapidly turning uncontrollable using enforcement mechanisms employ prevent stores selling cigarettes alcohol underaged. asking friend 

You expect us believe friends, asking disingenuous questions like this? Makes sense, buy fashion? Good try, communism!

ThiSs HeReee ‚ÄòMerIca! We‚Äôll NeVeRr wEArr mAssKs! don‚Äôt know, personally think roof worth risking people‚Äôs lives for. Surely seasonal property area know someone swing check things out, otherwise could call roofing company, ask pics etc. said one people citizen Canada closed border citizens...so least one wasn‚Äôt getting turned away border matter reason travel. wrong thing, sucks hopefully government continues checking people obviously can‚Äôt trusted. mean didn‚Äôt come random state next cases came worst hit state worst hit country STILL didn‚Äôt isolate.  STOP TESTING CREATING MANY NEW CASES!!! Stop lying, resign let someone else fix mistakes State statistics also show percentage children testing positive much higher population whole. Statewide, 31% 54,022 children tested positive. 

And go back school.  Fair enough. seems headlines I've seen mirror sentiment. suppose gets eyeballs - ultimately goal. unfortunate, bec type fearmongering going ultimately affect policy. 

\*Sigh\* thanks biting head anyway, want thing everyone - safe, sane policy. Saw local bar day getting take sitting vehicle. 20 people probably huddle together outside waiting get in. Maybe two masks group. Like fuck? food beer taste consume home. desire around drunk assholes much?  cares? good goal educate reach people ""regular"" scientists can't schtick provide valid information, effing cares? Slight correction: Board Education made recommendations, authority enforce them. Individual school districts make decisions. 
 
Now, since Orange County, school districts probably something dumb, announced anything yet.   Get ready everywhere. 2021 going better. concerts postponed next summer either postponed 2022 cancelled. basketball hockey season, least spectators. Schools start fall person, end school year homeschooling. impacts credibility, elevation man status truthteller instead person made decision misled public problem with.

That sub would elevate status evidence misled public one important ways stop Covid, says lot sub.

His statement arrogant actions probably led people putting risk went store without masks. knows many people infected wearing masks March April, certainly least thousands. lie. least lie might make percentage people act responsibly. Exactly thank God!  saw healthcare badge nose yesterday like wtf. Glad state mandating masks won‚Äôt stop people half-assing it.  always choose right arm, dominant arm, like idiot. time get colonized country female leader, way point  lol yeah way chucklefuck like priors. People going die decision. Good. Maybe sheep follow suit amuses take article task confidence language also claiming original article claims develops even partial immunity subsequent infections worse based 1 patient

so suggest ADE could happen, say must nothing section quoted supports contention author said develops even partial immunity.

logically reinfection possible, mean immunity impossible.

I care sloppy use language, give repeated cries tone language, assume find consistency hobgoblin little minds.

that aint compliment. disagree you. rarely see anyone East TN wearing mask even get chastised wearing one public. husband supposed get promotion raise, rescinded offer ""going broke."" They've making million extra dollars week since started. large global company, little tiny business. Schools?  seen single ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù move administration. It‚Äôs 100% political reasons distort story. GOP hates facts everyone except brainwashed supporters like make choices based good information. Pretty sure they're admitted country still go mandatory 14 day quarantine. Right, someone lives Maine dream able wall states out. even though idea potentially revisit get amendment place time help us now, energies better spent elsewhere we're worst it. live? live California would say 90% wear masks cases keep keep climbing. Suppress bad news anything contradicts lies. like two bit fascist strongman. problem he's going practically everyone know someone died COVID October keeps letting run control focuses suppressing bad news instead actual virus. Exactly. country one worst problems try one thing help? we're it, let's get rid seat belts since airbags now. one actually weird though. cabinets sold $10k+ given human names

also really fair bunch one examples. wasted 4 months opening economy prioritizing Pandemic measures answer way many people believing conspiracy theories. Russia's job done boys.

Look roman Emperors distracted people actual day day problems gladiatorial games, building shit need, invading ""barbarians"" endless wars. don‚Äôt know people around believe sources like Center Disease American Medical Association: failing New York Times, present things less data nerdy disclosure, grabbed quickly google. it‚Äôs pretty well known people pay attention things seen significant increases excess deaths compared previous years. could due number thing, like actual co-morbidities COVID (not reported covid death, related diagnosis like pneumonia) due lack access healthcare (full hospitals, people scared go doctor) Even liberal town there's lots people refuse wear masks scary amount starting believe face shields adequate replacements. Brazil worse infections, even close. **42%** positivity rate. US, hand, \~8.1% positives. Yep, feel you. job sent us home around March 18th. left house go grocery store per week, I've visited parents solo, husband driven parents 2nd home twice.

I know stopped keep reading it. slogan header fucking bonkers. 

Why still complaining Clinton frontpage? held office years lol goes way that. fake news posted reddit!

So, several dozen paragraph article, two sentences talk *devastating* ground breaking Trump administration **is poised** ask governors **consider** sending National Guard hospitals help improve data collection novel corona virus patients, supplies capacity, according draft letters, internal emails officials familiar plans‚Ä¶

So, words done anything regards CDC HHS officials Monday finalized new data reporting protocol hospitals, eliminate Centers Disease Control Prevention data recipient, leaving health-care institutions report information covid-19 federal contractor state, would coordinate federal reporting.

Litteraly even week ago, front page post Atlanta reporting cases correctly. Basically saying downplaying numbers cases. Edit: [This article Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) national public health institute United States. United States federal agency, **under** Department Health Human Services,[2] headquartered **Atlanta, Georgia**

This boils Trump administration making sure factual numbers reported. Actually protecting citizens fine country corrupt officials lying numbers.

edit: downvote instead arguing I'm wrong? Pitiful Huh? Please explain shame stupid people's actions affect themselves. attributed much stupidity enough malice.

you forget even arrogant Maskholes intelligent. Yes sub really something. 

Actually, one main reasons masks weren‚Äôt recommended early research shows wearing mask causes many people touch face fiddle around it. 

When realized surfaces weren‚Äôt large cause spread (and know contact tracing... you‚Äôre basically creating conspiracy theory world‚Äôs scientists engaged planned conspiracy falsify contact data order lie surface spread... anything admit don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about, suppose) began recommending masks. IMO seems like believe way administration ‚Äúwin‚Äù Covid-19 cook books hospitalizations deaths.

This among corrupt actions I‚Äôve heard done among authoritarian regimes, America. flu definitely give long term damage; know someone lost vision (black spots) bad flu, i.e. nerve damage.

Pretty sure he's going total infections/deaths percentage. 1918 influenza 500 million infections, covering third world's population. sheer number metric beats black death fairly substantially. ""raised countywide total 140,307 infections, according L.A. County Department Public Health. And, another 73 deaths reported county, bringing total 3,894 people succumbed illness."" States BLM protests/riots (Massachusetts, Michigan, etc) report increased number covid19 cases aftermath chaos happened June. 

This despite lack mask-wearing protests/riots. disprove social distancing thing? Large clusters people together outdoors increase covid19 spread. Proven.

There's need continue close beaches mandate social distancing protocols. debunked essentially could called biggest irl social experiment US history.  even, presumably majority cases, ""fuck (I make feel better pretending / I'm stupid think / I've cynically manipulated believe) got mine"". course add sarcasm tag, you‚Äôre fucking idiot. nursing home resident, serious issues.

Look bright side, virus spreads indoors, people homeless better right? /s hard convo. Reasonable people like us hear challenge us, fairly consider point ours, second consider could wrong. us, act, try empathize decide.

That's lost, though. See, never considered could wrong, puts doubt side. Even though thought didn't, ability consider COULD wrong puts us overwhelming psychological disadvantage get go. little shutdown Japan. Everyone suggest needed(still need) shutdowns never even needed wide scale.

So government response like lack one. larger group people tested. Phase 1 seems 100 people. Phase 2 hundred thing phase 3 thousands I'm sure many phase 3 usually is. Fauci says Covid-19 could reach level 1918 Spanish Flu.

America Brazil accept challenge. again. case fatality rate. 

The case fatality rate many people died divided many diagnosed infected (the cases). 

The infection fatality rate, total number deaths / total infected (diagnosed + undiagnosed).

THAT RATTLING HYPE subreddit unbelievable lmao No, denominations believe that, especially evangelicals. Like, Catholic church fully embraces evolution says viable theory. believe even teach creationism schools. I'll make numbers you

100 covid deaths divided 1000 cases equals 10% death rate.

If half cases made really

100 covid deaths divided 500 cases equals 20% death rate.

But wait say, deaths could made too.

100 bodies minus 50 covid bodies equals 50 extra bodies.

In real numbers 140k covid bodies 100k extra bodies. Make 70k 170k pandemic extra bodies instead pandemic covid hands.

Day 0: Exposure.

Day 1: 100% false negatives get test.

Day 2: 85%-100% risk false negatives. people start become infectious.

Day 4-5: 67% risk false negatives, people experience symptoms onset, infectiousness peaks.

Day 8: Test accuracy peak 3 days post symptom onset, false negative risk falls 20% (this good tests get), mean get tested 8 days exposure, vary people different incubation period. best result, wait 3 days symptom onset, go date exposure.

Day 14: Incubation period effectively over, 99.5% people would symptom onset now. Tests grow less reliable, false negative rate 25%-50%.

Infectiousness tend peak 0.7 days symptom onset (note estimate). data mostly based people develop symptoms clear holds true people remain asymptomatic entire infection. People symptoms go get tested, test develop symptoms later.

1918 flu &lt;2% mortality rate (it would obviously much lower today's medical system) - Covid around 1.6% IFR  


 final IFR depend western heatlhcare systems hold falls (looking us America) long ravages third world nations get access vaccine. projections India (the diabetes capital world), terrifying. 

As much know death rates Florida, idea real death rates African, South America, Russia, China -- poorest poor much higher IFRs majority western nations. Depending long goes, pull avg IFR lot closer &lt;2%. Water may wet, study says. one accepted 2000 deaths 9/11. went war it. Yet 100K+ deaths coronavirus people burying heads sand, unwilling weapons even with...MASKS! Imagine Bush said 9/11 real. would assume infectious human host virus?

I'm doc, certainly epidemiologist, made zero sense hear claims children spread virus. 

Of course, recently 1970s many doctors believed infants can't feel pain. 

Our power deny shockingly obvious utterly baffles me. news source trust coronavirus Fox. normal Fox though, Fox sports. national website, though, regional affiliate Texarkana, provide news Florida.

Come November people inside spread more. Hopefully case numbers low easily tracked spread whatever cases are. think ny right thing. wish ny wouldn‚Äôt stopped states same. Sure would‚Äôve helped prevent spread back then, ny times showed virus came ny Europe went everywhere east coast ny Well candidate SARS (closer covid-19 flu is) vaccine ended causing people worse symptoms infected. definitely flu shot agree, many would argue ‚Äúmost intelligent‚Äù mask wearers social distancers actually sheep they‚Äôre told. 

God love playing devils advocate reddit. I‚Äôm purely curious (and bit nervous) posting question. yesterday close friend mine lives Miami (a huge hotspot know) said two friends separate occasions go get tested COVID early last week. gave contact info early line, wait took long gave left long could get tested. Later week separately got calls saying tested positive COVID-19. 

Either friend made up, two separate individuals lying, something odd going on. Don‚Äôt get wrong, family following rules. scientist data guy, hope anomalies simply lies honest.

Has anyone else heard reports like coming hotspots? could long 13+ years:  Dr. Doom Gloom

/s dangerous children two wear masks. Better take out. always option.

My 2 year old giant looked much older. Venezuela hard assess. nearly impossible believe reported numbers remotely accurate, critics dubious motives well. Given state economy healthcare system, I'm pretty sure condition pretty dire, one seems telling truth it. wants kill us Based people seen hometown one suburbs. gas station example I‚Äôve never Walmart, hopefully every store security; they‚Äôre gonna need ‚ÄúbUt mUh LiBeRtY!!1!‚Äù selfish bastards. hard downplay threat posed Emus right now. media wants talk about.

This hilarious. Tesla actual contact tracing, telling people get tests quarantine... they're framing like horror movie? 

This prevent covid spreading. Tesla finds employee exposed, company notifies asks automaker wrote email ‚Äúaffected‚Äù precautionary only, test negative, return work 24 hours fever free (without use fever-reducing medication) improved symptoms (if symptoms test positive, need stay home 10 days test date least three days recovered. Recovery means fever gone 72 hours without use fever-reducing medications respiratory symptoms improved. doctor‚Äôs note required say fit return work.



Better state governments managed. right Trump saying bad numbers test more. Let's shit factory hotspot audacity contact tracing. DOES? lol good reason, JHs numbers much reliable. Next up, titans science use Government grants tackle great human mysteries like ‚ÄúIs fire hot?‚Äù course ‚ÄúWhy sky blue?‚Äù. Okay, doesn‚Äôt happen here. New York Chicago quarantines literally domestic travelers, absurd. Maybe Mars won‚Äôt bad all. way Sherlock. wont seeing true numbers going forward folks Nope. They'll zero cases soon, thanks Trump getting hospital data instead CDC. 

Problem solved. better publicized. I'm glad done privately. \#1 again, Arizona killing pandemic! report‚Äôs predictions come true he‚Äôll surprised pikachu... literally say press release. data expected published separately. Given increased morbidity mortality COVID-19 older elderly adults, additional evidence potential vaccine protect population urgent priority.

Another kind ‚Äúshower thought‚Äù day: wear mask, likely to...wear mask? this, mean metaphorical mask - facade, - mask show public. Many people think bad thing - kind ‚Äúfake‚Äù - actually really important, even vital, skill society think also shows emotional intelligence (that adjust behavior). Maybe non mask wearers (and provided generalization! course exceptions) what-you-see-is-what-you-get/heart sleeves types. Probably explaining well meant, haha.

 EXAMINE SEWAGE AREAS COUNTRY

 Published: July 15, 2020

 Recent weekly results SARS-CoV-2 virus wastewater samples National Center Public Health completed. recent weeks, sampling taken place Budapest, counties. Based results, said concentration virus measured wastewater studied settlements equally low everywhere. Based this, significant increase number diseases expected next 1-2 weeks. important emphasize infectious virus particles present wastewater, presence virus inheritance material examined sampling targeted, accurate official measures taken light results.

 NNK performs environmental monitoring part core tasks. purpose national wastewater surveys merely research, complement epidemiological surveys support forecasting. obligation NNK establish environmental development methods, environmental monitoring environmental quality regulation enshrined founding document legislation.

 Numerous international studies show increase number symptomatic cases given community follows increase hereditary concentration wastewater least 4‚Äì10 days. Among viruses, evidence already available new coronavirus.

 Wastewater testing, addition serving kind complex community sample, also good tool asymptomatic mildly symptomatic infected people discharge virus hereditary material would within scope epidemiology traditional screening tests. Yeah shit, really need scientific study show people ignoring guidelines prevent spread dangerous virus fucking morons?

I guess least study back though say anti-mask people selfish, trashy fucking morons.  could get behind Walmart boycott several reasons. Maybe bandwagon anti maskers‚Äô platform... distance meant better reason %age population absolute value comparing viruses deadliness that's Idk article reputable mistranslations, really don‚Äôt know think yet. may *recording* data. That's different US shitty politicians hiding it. There's reason vaccines take years develop.

The vaccine last pandemic resulted narcolepsy many months later... Nah trainwrecks nearly brutal enough. can't pronounce ingredients! two protests, one protest eliminating columbus day protest legislation would remove certain people's right bear arms, would able recognize people would see one important other? Agreed, live DC aspects response baffling, (mostly) trending even protests. example botched response, exactly zero guidance school reopenings, insane since teachers told maybe told what, any, safety measures place.

All said, richer parts DC, mix mostly white, definitely fared better poorer, mostly black areas. I'd argue much failure existing infrastructure care poorer communities DC, problem city gentrifies, response specific pandemic. problem test, trace, isolate works low prevalence. Arizona decide let run control, there's way get timely test results whole state. 

At point, testing reserved hospital patients health care workers. Anyone else symptoms quarantine 14 days. sucks, need lock down, going keep getting worse. excuse use one week lag time data presented public.

Instead, see political control data. Hospitals need turn information directly press compile it. WH retaliates way, go Courts freedom expression/freedom press case. surprised he's accuses others doing? That's party's MO years. Good them! mean, get wrong, USA definitely screwed response. compare Finland's response kinda silly considering USA population 65 times larger landmass 29 times larger Finland. That's true! think difference rental property owner really anything patrons (other occasionally proxy calls maintenance person). many cases skimming money people less money you.

Thats say times makes sense, like people need say somewhere 6 months year permanently. multi unit buildings much better that. Buying single family homes rental properties generally bad communities. cant data sent two places simultaneously? /r/wallstreetbets totally got ya Username... checks out? would say gunshot inside ambulance got shot (inadvertent triple-rhyme?). order save masks health care workers people could stay home spread virus? 

Look dont blame Fauci administration american people completely fucked up. I'm canada also scientific field sorry almost new cases city actually listened experts. 

But keep going America, make sure stay countries See, reddit hivemind agrees ""america bad"" ugh.  sincerely doubt many stores policing this.. home office management general seen crazies take employees states cases may Post signs ask people put entering expect strongly enforcing it. course differ store store.. managers may try enforce strongly doubt many will. one wants see associate attacked worse trying enforce company policy. Unless going hire duty police enforce expect people barely making living wage confront possibly armed members public mask. Refusing entry far going go going physically try stop you. 

All said applaud move associate company many begging ever since mandated wear them. Avoid casket, please mask FUCKed Donald Duck It‚Äôs also many people think ‚Äúdefund police‚Äù means ‚Äúget rid police officers.‚Äù Tbf, sounds like they're asking assholes taking vacations middle pandemic give extra money. Assholes taking advantage assholes concern much. really stupid definitely slippery slope, agree. ambiguous. whatever else targeted harassment admits. Hate break ya man, that‚Äôs smart. Maybe lot cases US. might time hire unemployed Med students. What‚Äôs from? people support know care this. better fit /r/COVID19, academic letter. mostly news sub. guy, back back; got frustrating watching health professional. interesting watch video it. I'm surprised one tackled figure is. r/PublicFreakout get flood new material starting next week then... testing dealing lot sick people? trump suspect, doesnt enjoy rewarding poor results course, people US still dont know someone infected virus, worry it. US hospitals treat patients come in. Let hospitals prove patient Covid medical definition, signs symptoms now. would give true death toll, one people come pre-existing conditions covid, die pre- existing conditions get counted covid deaths.
Watch CDC flip flopped everything they‚Äôve said I'm really shocked took Walmart long USA. Mexico, Walmart supermarkets strict one mask one family member (which every family bypassed entering minutes apart whatever) policy starting April.

At entrance, check temperature refuse (or mask) told leave. work Wal-Mart behind scenes, danger everywhere. masks chin masks workers piling choke zones. terrified!! people see social distance 300 pounds. less worried distance mask wearing. great physical shape. cant determine intelligence way. multi variable. Trump administration WORSE CCP point I'm really glad staying safe! Good luck there! hospice example extreme outlier. agree probably inaccurate. look seasonal excess death numbers, likely undercounting COVID-related deaths magnitude far outpaces examples like one gave.

My point arguing specific cause death nothing people trying play armchair physician without medical training knowledge. Can't negotiate biology. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

In fact, facemask obtained countries medical standard easily redistributed population would completely fine normal every day use. ask leave that's far go cases. Unless duty police call police walmart sams associate going escalate risk safety enforce policy willing bet tell associates much policy. Perfect example physically trying stop shop lifter lead termination wal-mart want liable getting hurt killed trying stop shop lifter. That‚Äôs necessarily true. It‚Äôs 1% fatality rate across entire population. It‚Äôs vastly lower younger people seems that‚Äôs substantial proportion new cases coming from. isn‚Äôt conservative estimate, it‚Äôs actually extremely pessimistic given data currently have. I‚Äôm saying downplay situation, take account.  Science works best researchers everywhere access reliable data. someone manipulates data that's released would disaster. risky you. Upvoted ya! comforting ü§î Alright that's enough. time start producing sources. believe single thing say anymore. Trump wants make everything seem normal. wants believe go business usual. wants economy inherited Obama return. wants everyone buy buy buy forget pandemic. problem pandemic going way handle it, well thought scientific data driven approach requires mass collection data data analysis, order form logical scientific data driven response.


However, team Trump election denying data useful first place. whole presidency based idea reality convince people is. convinced many scientists, journalists, subject matter expertise would contradict narrative, enemy people. Afterall, ""fooling citizens"" approach presidency country. He's he's always done. 


The problem Trump's typical ""go to"" response many people going die. hundreds thousands people dead. convince Americans best interest? shutter thought what's come...what next? makes sense, state (Rhode Island) people allowed get tested symptoms, work high contact areas (gyms, etc). work gym symptoms we‚Äôre encouraged take advantage testing. 

So happens don‚Äôt get test results? don‚Äôt fall self-quarantine guidelines symptoms. test could still come back positive delay. 

It‚Äôs weird spot in. Yeah- CDC reopening guideline immediately ignored places.

The obvious 14 days declining cases could start reopening. I'm sure anyone that. Let's see many people willing wear mask Walmart church Guy admit anything. predicted perceive targeted harassment Antibody production single important factor clinical efficacy every single vaccine used humans today. Copying comment another thread yesterday.

 subreddit. wondering?

Thanks point yesterday's post still reported data, 318,664 positives 3,029,149 tests; 318,664/3,029,149 = ***10.5%*** positive rate 
Subtracting 3,528 positives ""all-positive labs"", instead 315,136/3,025,621 = ***10.4%*** positive rate

The impact % positive rate small. I'm sure even including labs average %pos number still minimal Knowing know sign intelligence! I'm one worried, I've heard worry several people. doubling past weeks' average almost last days. Good spiking further, yes something worry much about, great sign either. Ron DieSantis needs resign now. Don‚Äôt worry tomorrow 0 White House sabotaging counts.  Hey, I'm capable of.

Trucking honest field. Come in, get work done, get paid. know attracted conservative, anti-science bunch. Time change that. prints money 4 8 weeks? Wow. huge conspiracy make Trump look bad!!!!! think so, work dumbest Trump drone that's spewed every stupid talking point alt-right sphere tried. Sweden's right, Swine Flu worse, Italy unique we'll never get bad, New York unique rest US never get bad...of course idiot's anti-masker. infuriating listen someone parrot fucking stupidity lies. Interesting. part talk trying avoid using big words result formative experiences, mine same. think bland word would given k-12 school years would ""precocious"", you, source ton bullying.

Interesting digression, avid reader tested us end 8th grade, middle school school district, placed going high school, skipped mandatory ninth grade grammar class entirely. able take placement test knew sounded right based reading without actually knowing right. result, day, identify (mostly) parts speech, diagram sentence life depended it.

Feels like way anger people goodwill right now. think quarantine. Aint much 4 big ones Malaria stay life quite true viral load. Different viruses different infective doses viral load fluctuate. changes may may correlate symptoms. HBV example flare, associated symptoms. HIGH hcv viral load asymptomatic sudden cirrhotic. know deal SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

I also think healthcare workers important group study may best representative viral immunity transmissability general population. many confounders. Last week 35-50% taking week. labs far behind ridiculous.

Holy cow. needed proof fellow countrymen brain capacity turnips, here's one piece evidence!

- Add equation rent subsidy reduced employer contributions ended June 30, many support measures left. adjustment support extended, risk seeing redundancies, unemployed bankruptcies, says Stefan Westerberg.

The pandemic made Swedes travel less before. Tourism abroad plummeted.

Normally, foreign tourists spend around SEK 155 billion Sweden.

- Half 155 billion normally spent June-August, summer months weigh heavily many players, says Stefan Westerberg.

It big cities Stockholm forefront worst affected usually foreign tourism rest country. cities also dependent concerts major events currently canceled.

Fuck people WASHINGTON ‚Äî Trump administration ordered hospitals bypass Centers Disease Control Prevention send coronavirus patient information central database Washington beginning Wednesday. move alarmed health experts fear data politicized withheld public.

The new instructions posted little-noticed document Department Health Human Services website. on, department ‚Äî CDC ‚Äî collect daily reports patients hospital treating, number available beds ventilators, information vital tracking pandemic.



Officials say change streamline data gathering assist White House coronavirus task force allocating scarce supplies like personal protective gear remdesivir, first drug shown effective virus. Health Human Services database receive new information open public, could affect work scores researchers, modelers health officials rely CDC data make projections crucial decisions.

‚ÄúHistorically, CDC place public health data sent, raises questions access researchers access reporters, access public try better understand happening outbreak,"" said Jen Kates, director global health HIV policy nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

‚ÄúHow data protected?‚Äù asked. ‚ÄúWill transparency, access, role CDC understanding data?‚Äù

News change came shock CDC, according two officials spoke condition anonymity authorized discuss matter. Michael R. Caputo, Health Human Services spokesman, called CDC‚Äôs system inadequate said two systems would linked. CDC would continue make data public, said.



‚ÄúToday, CDC still least week lag reporting hospital data,‚Äù Caputo said. ‚ÄúAmerica requires real time. new, faster complete data system nation needs defeat coronavirus, CDC, operating division HHS, certainly participate streamlined all-of-government response. simply longer control it.‚Äù
But instructions hospitals department guidance explicit underscored: ‚ÄúAs July 15, 2020, hospitals longer report COVID-19 information document National Healthcare Safety Network site,‚Äù CDC‚Äôs system gathering data 25,000 medical centers around country.

Public health experts long expressed concerns Trump administration politicizing science undermining health experts, particular CDC; four agency‚Äôs former directors, spanning Republican Democratic administrations, said much opinion piece published Tuesday Washington Post. data collection shift reinforced fears.

‚ÄúCentralizing control data umbrella inherently political apparatus dangerous breeds distrust,‚Äù said Dr. Nicole Lurie, served assistant secretary preparedness response former President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúIt appears cut ability agencies like CDC basic job.‚Äù



The shift grew tense conference call several weeks ago hospital executives Dr. Deborah L. Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator. Birx said hospitals adequately reporting data, convened working group government hospital officials devised new plan, according Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer Association American Medical Colleges, participated group‚Äôs meetings.

While said understood Lurie‚Äôs concern, Orlowski said administration pledged ‚Äúa verbal discussion‚Äù make data public ‚Äî least give hospitals access it.

‚ÄúWe comfortable long continue work us, long continue make information public, long we‚Äôre able continue advise look data,‚Äù said, calling switch ‚Äúa sincere effort streamline improve data collection.‚Äô‚Äô

The change exposes vast gaps government‚Äôs ability collect manage health data ‚Äî antiquated system best, experts say. CDC collecting coronavirus data National Healthcare Safety Network, expanded outset pandemic track hospital capacity patient information specific COVID-19.

In new guidance, Health Human Services said going forward, hospitals report detailed information daily basis directly new centralized system, managed TeleTracking, health data firm headquarters Pittsburgh. However, hospitals already reporting information states, could continue received written release saying state would handle reporting.



Sen. Patty Murray Washington, top Democrat Senate Health Committee, raised questions TeleTracking contract, calling ‚Äúnoncompetitive, multimillion-dollar contract‚Äù ‚Äúduplicative health data system.‚Äù

Both CDC network TeleTracking system set Health Human Services rely so-called push data, meaning hospital employees must manually enter data, rather government tapping electronic system obtain information.

‚ÄúThe whole thing needs scrapped started anew,‚Äù said Dr. Dan Hanfling, expert medical disaster preparedness vice president In-Q-Tel, nonprofit strategic investment firm focused national security. ‚ÄúIt laughable administration can‚Äôt find wherewithal bring 21st-century technologies data management fight.‚Äù

Hanfling others agree information need centralized, disagree happen. Hanfling called new ‚Äúnational data coordination center‚Äù would used ‚Äúforecasting, identifying, detecting, tracking reporting emerging diseases.‚Äù

Rep. Donna E. Shalala, D-Fla., served health secretary President Bill Clinton, said CDC proper agency gather health data. flaws CDC‚Äôs systems, said, fixed.

‚ÄúOnly CDC expertise collect data,‚Äù Shalala said. ‚ÄúI think move take responsibility away people expertise politicizing.‚Äù



Hospitals say previous reporting requirements cumbersome, partly frequently changed.
‚ÄúIt administrative hassle confusing constantly shifting gears reporting hospitals front lines pandemic,‚Äù Carrie Williams, spokeswoman Texas Hospital Association, wrote email.

At Rush University Medical Center Chicago pandemic raged, hospital four full-time employees reporting coronavirus data four different agencies, said Dr. Bala N. Hota, hospital‚Äôs chief analytics officer. Rush collected 100 different measures, determined much money would receive different federal programs.
But Hota said supported streamlining process involvement state local agencies reporting, also concerned months pandemic, United States still established system collecting kind information needed seamlessly move patients full hospital one available beds.

‚ÄúThe CDC right agency forefront collecting data,‚Äù Hota said.

The CDC criticized data collection, however. May, agency acknowledged tracking spread virus, combining tests detect active infection detect recovery COVID-19. system muddied picture pandemic raised percentage Americans tested President Donald Trump boasting number tests United States conducting.

Similar complaints coronavirus data bubbled around country.

In Florida, former data manager state Health Department accused one superiors directing ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù data used state‚Äôs plan lift stay-at-home orders spring. Shalala said mayor Miami-Dade County ‚Äúwas concerned state data hospitals reporting data directly well.‚Äù

And Arizona ended partnership university modeling team whose projections showed rising caseload, prompting pushback Humble, executive director Arizona Public Health Association former director state‚Äôs Health Services Department.

‚ÄúTrust accountability transparency ‚Äî three go together,‚Äù Humble said. federal government‚Äôs new system, said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd better keep transparent, else people going think ulterior motive.‚Äù

#Happy faces


When Nordic prime ministers met Reykjavik last year, mood high.

- Nordic region, repeatedly shown stronger together, declared.

They launched common vision - make Nordic region world's sustainable integrated region 2030.


It less year since meeting, picture collaboration completely changed.


When √ñresund Bridge, symbol Danish-Swedish integration, celebrated 20th anniversary week, motorists met border controls. Haparanda, former symbolic border Tornio transformed effective wall Norwegians flock usual shops summer houses Bohusl√§n.


**And neighboring country wants completely open border Sweden.**


- natural reflex 20 years ago would solve together, says Johan Strang, Nordic researcher University Helsinki.


- Since refugee crisis 2015, closing borders become universal solution political problem. something happened, says points nationalist attitude.

#Tired Danish debate

In Danish media, Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell well-known face. Sweden's handling pandemic death tolls tops news. Sweden chosen different path Nordic countries border Sweden handled widely discussed.

One tired domestic debate going Bertel Haarder, Member Parliament bourgeois [right] Venstre Party many years earlier former minister.


- Citizens countries treated greater risk citizens, tells TT.


He questions closed borders method limiting spread infection. virus know national borders, easily stop traffic Great Belt Sound, reasons, speaking fact Copenhagen area contagious Sk√•ne.


Haarder chairman Nordic Border Barriers Council believes Nordic countries must learn mistakes next crisis. wants see joint emergency contacts countries help more. never anything border without first negotiating neighboring country good time.


- surprised difficult communicate made decision, says Bertel Haarder.

- Swedish ministers right Nordic co-operation damaged. Denmark, Norway Finland done damage.

#Wants normal mode

Denmark's Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod (S) previously said reason Nordic cooperation temporarily buried pandemic Sweden differs countries.

In email reply TT, expresses diplomatically:

""I think possible find two neighboring countries whose bilateral relationship affected global corona crisis. also applies Nordic countries. normal forms cooperation have, course, left behind favor dealing health crisis.""

He regrets cooperation deteriorated, hopes soon return ""normal"".

#The Nordic region brand

From 1950s refugee crisis 2015, Nordic passport union functioned without major problems. borders closed last year Denmark introduced border controls prevent Swedish criminals entering country.

- corona crisis rather symptom everything right collaboration, says researcher Johan Strang.

His hypothesis rulers see Nordic region selling point community.

- become much interested using Nordic region brand, example market food. taken focus away taking care everyday cooperation, says.

He claims effort money previously put institutionalized collaboration, projects.

#FACT

Official co-operation takes place Nordic Council Ministers, governments co-operate, Nordic Council, parliamentarians' co-operation forum.

The corona pandemic first time countries made different political choices. example, Norway Denmark members NATO, countries outside. Sweden, Denmark Finland members EU, Norway clearly saying membership.

In August 2019, Nordic prime ministers presented common vision Nordic co-operation - Nordic region world's sustainable integrated region 2030.

Why leave comment replying directly get it, hate black people

Perhaps read replying to?

Or people called add racial divide needlessly? think calling people racist blanket response constructive? OP dead serious. Expect least 100,000 deaths. needed? comment banal, empty big words says quite literally nothing bunch unexplained speculation thrown in. Let's unpack, shall removes CDC reporting module instead allows hospitals choose 4 modules.

I know ""module"" is, term used federal government describe reporting functions, cut shit out. sounds like CDC going collate data. don‚Äôt believe change way makes data manipulation easier

Maybe does, maybe doesn't. Depends new collection agency director listens to. suggests federal government may giving mitigation, least that‚Äôs tone health agencies sensing.

Changing data collection indicate way. small, well protected difficulty actually much public health.

""Well protected""? I'm even sure means. could sub agency less ""protected"" parent agency, controls everything it? protected what? Political monkeying? protection political monkeying 1) laws prevent firing define succession, would apply differently CDC parent likelihood, 2) presidential appointees reside, which, again, totally irrelevant HHS, parent agency, controls CDC. worse it‚Äôs made vulnerable HHS

Read previous. asinine suggest sub agency *that controlled parent entirely* somehow newly ""vulnerable"", parent agency less. Vulnerable what? Policy changes? Changes leadership? always ""vulnerable"" sense, way boss ""vulnerable"" boss every single thing work. like suggestimh accounting department ""vulnerable"" decisions directors office company. shit, Sherlock. CDC directed HHS, always subordinate, continue be. ""new vulnerability"" makes seems like HHS figured get whole room doesn‚Äôt share little brother anymore. 

As parent agency, HHS always ""whole room itself"" agencies org chart. true every agency entire government. dumb description.

You provided quite literally concrete discussion explains way words mean, fantasize mythical relationships parent sub agencies basis reality. throwing around empty words playing people's deep misunderstanding bureaucracy sound like know really lot worse people realize

So spent entire comment describing ""weakness"" CDC, quite literally explained nothing means, matters practical sense all. made two massive speculative comments: 1) government giving mitigation, 2) things worse. spent rest time spewing made garbage explained nothing arrived two opinions, even mean. 

The fact is, government's public health arm operated primarily scientists overridden scientific effort taken bureaucrats closer president, who, necessarily lose contradicting him, weaker reputation (and thus commitment) ensuring truth. facts right now. know means Trump pressure HHS collect report differently, given way reported problems *way data reported*, bet move motives line that. Honestly it‚Äôs amazing

Looking closer, that's 7% normal baseline death rate, 7% infected virus. two completely different data points (FWIW). fact positive Covid (antibody tests often generate false positives pick antibodies common cold coronaviruses mistaken Covid antibodies) odds infected 27.7%, odds infected anyone else 10%-20%, perhaps lower children. See Table 3 Household Secondary Attack rates. possible families close talk lot together may likely infected families spend time apart.

Last week VP‚Äôs task force press conference Ducey‚Äôs local press conference shortly thereafter. Meanwhile still short 3k tests (on average) numbers reported tests administered July 2. 20% positivity, that‚Äôs another 600 cases. considering still hours long lines get test testing sites opening extending hours , can‚Äôt fathom testing less. saying government shouldn't. Whether business owner worker, need social safety net right now. Lack safety net give right endanger public though. 

That's like saying ""ok"" sell crack unless government provides income. Stand flood angry confrontation videos possible gunplay. mean it‚Äôs great enough, give money tax right after, earn taxed.

Take upvote little gesture. Oh know, mom works hospital adamant family wearing masks since mid Feb. insane something I've already accepted 'the norm' pushed lies, fucking insane China pretty transparent article new, information people following regularly read couple months ago. good summary someone paying much attention details. Already went way Arizona (mainly individual cities came together agreed force it, go small government one), much mess imagine.

Yup people can't socially distance keep one two thoughts head time.

This explains advertising propaganda effective. catchy ad seen literally thing one people think see next piece propaganda.

This reason politicians reduce everything soundbites catchphrases like MAGA. That's info processed.

And 24 hour news cycle. Everything previous day, week, month, forgotten make room factoids day.

If control media people consume control think. pretty garbage working memories past.

This long form news important. Factoids days events fairly meaningless without context.  Interesting. Yeah, CT lung scans look remarkably similar.

Dude, probably vaccine available time frame. Sadly state Walmart‚Äôs little metal gates easily walk around one side door, inside counting. don‚Äôt stop don‚Äôt even think enforcing strict limit customers. Ah AR nothing disagree. states way lower deaths per capita DC, least right now. DC 800 deaths per million, US average 400 per million, lot states still 200 per million. I'm sure people happily going trade four times many deaths earlier reopening. might end bad DC end -- AZ especially bad trajectory seems -- I'd surprised if, example, CA FL do. we'll wait see. FL ends per capita deaths DC (in case ~75% deaths yet come), yes, suppose people dying quickly bargain one might take. early make judgment.

Where DC shines comparison failures NYC, also hit first wave largely stabilised way DC has, took twice deaths per capita get there. Bowser @ DC clearly much, much better job Cuomo/DeBlasio. say 100x better. would say, well, 2x better. dealing kinds death tolls here, 2x makes big, big difference. Miami we've wear masks stores including Walmart since March. 

Never removed mandate even moved new phases.

Btw sub deleted many comments saying political, although mention politics position simple:

When power used abuse, needs taken away.

In case Texas government forcing teachers choose health finances, abusing power. best option teachers collectively refuse. necessarily need union; could individually decided go work. However, union offers representation and, perhaps importantly, support (even support knowing alone).

In case police unions protecting bad cops, abusing power unionization. also needs dealt with, though complicated I'm qualified suggest may done. Regardless, needs done.

Unions like systems power: Necessary prone corruption abuse. I'm power, strongly opposed corruption abuse.   Get ready people going shocking freak outs anti-maskers date. people rural areas vacation Disney World? Give month. one squeeled excitement? Let mullet wearing, uneducated, shoe wearing, meth headed toothlessness debauchery begin! Walmart ages, bet ass going now! one switched sides.

Republicans always side reopening immediately democrats always side shutting down. Quick question You‚Äôre quote article states already use... maybe common sense. worked really well Europe.  Corona viruses much quicker mutations though, that‚Äôs main point. also allowed entry without shoes shirt, expect hand well? Americans hate alive healthy much? 100% spot on.  don‚Äôt think CCP step time demand tax money back, schools csnt provide reasonable safe learning experience paying them? Shouldnt CPS get involved killing children? Haha. never see cause state requires masks anyway. uniform? agree. feel may false sense security. logic, probably already hit 100k. like rule. I'm stealing it. Sorry, meant theater theater like living one. Walmart instituted masks warehouse workers since April think. I‚Äôm actually happy they‚Äôve done protect workers.

I wear mask, I'm convinced effective (super convinced), see harm trying something might even help little. I've mostly gone anywhere months though. Ha, local police lowstakesconspiracy boomers pining inheritance take real common practice high school. Marching band requires lot students effective enormous time effort commitment. teachers allow students play concert band play marching band fall. Maybe band teachers waive policy due covid lack competitive marching season ( bandmaster association officially canceled competitive season 2 weeks ago) Look America ""isn't shutting down"", like Japan didn't, look number cases, look Europe, we're mild increase infections due lockdown lifted reinstated actually criticising lockdown measures, *pandemic?* effective way reduce number cases. Sweden's death rate fucking high. Per million people, Sweden suffered 40 percent deaths United States, 12 times Norway, seven times Finland six times Denmark. people could actually alive, imposed lockdown measures. Sweden's death toll one highest whole world. might *relatively* high, compared casualties war. lets say make comparison, Usain Bolt fast all, mean, look fast light travels! worldwide pandemic, context countries, success dealing it, Sweden simply fucked up. life lost negative, life percentage screen look shrug like edgy 14 year old. companies this.

WDW closed *weeks* states implemented lockdowns.

But them, companies can't expected lead way... supposed government public health mind.

In NJ, wear mask go Home Depot governor requires it.

I illusions state government, one would wear mask.

This something blame Home Depot company for. something blame state federal government for.

Especially Trump. King Karens. read article. see evidence parks causing spread. Saying ‚Äúsome people fear‚Äù using word ‚Äúmay‚Äù sure let people get away spreading misinformation days

As ignoring outside information may have, like pretty simple fact asymptomatic person spread it. anything draws people contributes spread.

This simple, obstinate.  favor, keep us another 6 months minimum. actually open schools, within one week they'll doomed 10,000 people. Calm down. entirely possible everything right still get Covid19. Covfefid course right White House paragon virtue righteousness.

The words actions media, president, governors, leaders meaning. telling us take seriously, lot people won't. unified message critical, that, American leadership utterly failed us Coronavirus outbreak. Ok Karen I'm ""bouncing one extreme next"". I'm merely pointing ""people going die"" valid argument. Mask casket. going give employees mace post security guards everywhere? sick people getting shat jobs. Hoo boy internet videos gonna lit next week. Let's number fudging lies begin!
Wheeeeee ""believe"" it. real. That's like saying believe moon something ridiculous. also first Coronavirus. Anyway, clearly troll. Get life loser. Go die ditch, that's plan! work restaurant yes happens. policy point send employees temped high kind symptoms (covid otherwise) get tested could come back. first months usually day two get test, 2-3 days results, 4 6 day turnaround together. taking 4 5 days get scheduled test (at least going city provided option) 7-10 days results, easily turns 2 week process. need robust testing coincide opening up, need able quickly figure sick get people working back, people cant tend situation. likely employee isolate show symptoms 14 days getting test result, alot people could potentially working cant got play safe. Even cut dry, ive got one guy right fatigued aches, fever whole time. took several days get scheduled, results wont least seven days. However, even tests negative decided still feeling fatigued aches going wait till hes least 10 days symptoms, unfortunately false negatives reality deal well. Im Texas btw, put perspective weve maybee half 30 person staff tested point, everyones negative. often allergies, strep, things, need talk doctors get tested quickly else breaks quick terms keeping enough staff available. dont know schools going pull off, industry matter, continue forced open given recourses needed safely. health care system already breaking points themselves. Lmao Trump testing fallacy play right here.

Only 49 customers tested. garuntee infected.

Are people bitching masks 4 weeks ago telling us masks impenetrable barriers? Nice crystal ball got swear someone hurts husband this.... omg know would do. actually know would speak words. job stocking groceries pieces shit Agreed. sympathy people turn apartment 15-person hostel full bunk beds. Duh. ü§™ don‚Äôt think US set high benchmark success... fucking guy everywhere. hear everyday. listen, keep distance them. agree watch numbers coming DC currently available public without manipulation spin report second see happening. Gold prices high actually reflects opposite confidence ..  though assume sarcastic aww dude, completely understand.

I like say I'm easy-going person, really disturbs much seeing much nastiness stupidity facebook. People saying masks work never wear one people saying deaths US over-exaggerated scare people. worst mother group friends.

It seems like pandemic can't end everyone's loved one ICU Hahaha same, always end coming back lmao. damn time! current ‚Äúsafer home‚Äù order ends end month, assume it‚Äôs keep dates same. kay ivey absolute idiot comparison. They'll both. Everything declared fully open way overcharge vaccine. Well, tried explain reinfection herd immunity contradict *on principle*. I'm afraid right, reason coronavirus less reinfection capability established cousins. Hopefully severeness, complication death rate lower one two magnitudes second time... fans deniers think maskless heroes sicken die virus?

I mean, conspiracy matter unless affects Trump himself?

If old man alone White House nobody even go it‚Äôs ablaze disease... people... learn?  possible? Pikaciu Shock Face! pandemic started, biggest fear schools going handle August/September came. 

Anyone public schools know incredibly fast sicknesses spread. see one kid start coughing, accept everyone else going get sick eventually. Scroll bottom Worldometer page note getting statistics. Yep, CDC reports. seen Marchand? understand correctly, even guy regrets wearing mask.

I sometimes think illness deadlier, even couple percent, shit would taken much seriously we'd already better shape things open. lethal enough, people fuck around. Maybe, I'm skeptical simple. We've done protections nursing home factories state half size Sweden death rate way lower. I'm skeptical tracing isolation work well asymptomatic people. We've far cautious live played media. another reason vast difference. odd Sweden control sudden weren't. Well would useful set context harassment Sweden.

You still anonymous, give us understanding angle. 

A debate one sided. nah I've never done one those. memory serves, even donated one (yet)

but little know KS's, fill forms online, say KS -- e.g., ""from July 20th Aug. 20th, KS raise money Texasville ISD Teachers Strike Fund"" -- pay KS company fee, congrats KickStarter campaign kind limitations North? wasn‚Äôt NPRs headline, OP added line misleading, he‚Äôs quarantine announced zoom, things bad enough without making worse conditions nice doctor tried, he's ultimately wasting time. nuts, sort evidence points away conspiracy evidence conspiracy itself. go deep deeper rabbit hole.

The version posted annoying ""story"" commentary talking heads. 
Here original  Basically think lockdowns harm society locking down. Especially consider ""secondary"" effects (things like suicides, ODs, shortened lifespans result depression poverty) ""external"" effects (things like geopolitical destablization leads starvation war).

We examples countries didnt lock down, fine. told you, last year, 5000 people Sweden died year bad sickness might even expect international news. alarming.

Were ""perfect""? No. Could even fewer deaths strict lockdown? Maybe? 

Could save even TONS lives *always locked down*? Yes, right? never left houses would save sooo many people! would stupid, right? obviously sliding scale ""total safety"" ""normal life"".

Basically .. think lockdowns terrible price pay. dont think effectiveness worth it. think masks sensible measures (like protecting vulnerable) would accomplish want. People forced work jobs evicted laid already. fucked entity unfuck it, federal government. Haha, lot South Africa Truthfully it‚Äôs terrible place spend time right provided keep distance parties Please don‚Äôt. need expertise time. waiting one makes illegal list Covid19 cause death. got 1911, plan getting semi-auto shotgun soon. links intelligence working memory capacity, states people comply social distancing better working memory capacity.

Gonna need Mr. Oh no, another Facebook public health, infectious disease constitutional law expert doing""research"". Thanks gracing us vast knowledge unsolicited opinion. Clinton‚Äôs Welfare Reform eviscerated lots good programs would helpful right now. Democrats coming around complicit years, bad. ignoring half story saying masks protect COVID-19. protect YOU, wearer (although protect somewhat), protect others YOU. COVID-19 attaches droplets water get expelled mouth. wearing mask, even incorrectly, reducing amount droplets expelled distance expelled. means masks prevent droplets contaminating surfaces too, reduces spread. Yes, people touch masks, people also touch faces without mask. Wearing masks feels like common sense, majority research backs this, that's masks almost become religion. I'm company's manager. Actually, whole department.

Just everybody has, now, asked physically come office get help troubleshooting something.

I'm like...no. EARTH would remote in? nuts? time go somebody else's office cube *no choice*. inevitably involves messing around hardware - something cannot done remotely.

But *always* alone workspace. make abundantly clear leave go far away. 6 feet. Far. office, close LOCK door.

And I'm done, wash hands raw, head straight office, close door. Oh light fever Using metaphor, they've run cash checking account borrowing pay mortgage/rent recently. They've almost gone bust before, remember, there's nothing unique, financial streams cut (parks, movies, ESPN, maybe Disney+ launch free month falloff), huge cost base, easy time them. Many think overstretched buy Fox left cash-poor wrong time. 

I guess we'll know 2020 financial statements come out, sell-offs, long term liabilities $60Bn costs expenses, Executives salaries slashed, massive layoffs, expecting big dividend year greatly reduced revenue. ten times worse similar countries ""quite well""? Even US better 1/10 worst scenario point *looks fresh rash skin*

Yea imma need info well

(I ezcema, may jsut one looks weird) hate fucking state wish live here. covid trackers use data others dont. Johns Hopkins one doesnt use data worldometer does. Presumed data believe went movie night brother died hospital alone IIRC. think gives shit anybody general US disbanded early 2017.

Haha ok. Nancy give dove bar, lib. People tremendously egotistically get bitten back higher-ups care. course it‚Äôs deliberate. Ever since Regan said ‚ÄúThe nine terrifying words are: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm government I‚Äôm help‚Äô‚Äù massive war publicly directed government assistance, Republicans Democrats alike (anyone remember Clinton‚Äôs welfare ‚Äúreform‚Äù?)

You deliberately misinterpreted comment order smartass. Fuck you.

You think ""No shit"" obvious mockery rude? Here, I'll show rude. Lol, you‚Äôre pathetic. article explains test. It‚Äôs used determine many types infection. It‚Äôs newly used coronavirus. I‚Äôve heard anyone- doctor scientist say PCR unreliable, antibody test useless, PCR.[the science behind PCR wasn‚Äôt China though it. basically said need lockdown bc even lockdown hospitals overwhelmed 10 weeks, without shutdown healthcare basically collapse. Welp, better late never guess. Idk getting voted. Yes, really important work home possible companies extend policies time being. However, extending forever drawbacks lot people. 

I work really collaborative, technical field much harder work side side coworkers. difficult ask simple help, second opinion, draw examples talking whiteboard IM/call people. also typically look screen day, talk people face-to-face. eyes far fatigued since March

Plus, fully separate workspace home, I'm going buy massive home suburbs get bunch extra home office rooms.

Its necessary now, absolutely would choose stay field work home 100% (or even 60%) time That‚Äôs like it, Alabama. want live stereotype. mask order made way much sense. Bulgarian Pathology Association? Yep, work EMS people actually COPD always wear masks even home know get COVID likely die. there's real threat workers finally snapping getting a...... (whispers) union

not mention possibility someone eventually successfully sue business protecting adequately coronavirus. there's liability, fun begins  it. imagine people need kids school things like work without paying ridiculous amount childcare. probably end staying work kids, every child two parent household, every two parent household work around other's schedules afford parent stay home indefinitely. live central MN. local walmart parking lot 50 feet trailer park. last 3 months Wal-Mart rather large black security guard entrance.

If four corona viruses account 20% cold infections I‚Äôd guess - (statistically) I‚Äôve re-infected corona viruses multiple times (with peak infection frequency happening short bursts) life colds generally suck equally time get sick.

I doubt option next infection don‚Äôt notice mild, based coronaviruses.

I understand saying, based upon colds - doubt we‚Äôll enough people immunity prevent lots people continually getting sick it. check comment history, like professional disinformation poster downplaying covid. I'm Tampa lying. Pick store meet may see 1 person without mask likely 100% masked. I've Publix, Aldi Walmart see one person fighting mask wearing one. sure crazy part town I'm buying description what's happening. saw one person argue two months ago Wawa mask. Also, get new friends mine least moderately concerned. ""Whatever mean face coverings required? simply wish procure caviar establishment!""  Trump administration pretending things go back normal suppressing data pandemic. Thank taking time give time answer questions thoughtfully. appreciate explanations.

As teacher, use data many types assessments determine progress students making academically also determine making progress. progressing, use data determine breakdown learning develop plan get back track. experiences, know data badly needed timely manner develop best plan action hard time trying understand anyone would want change way data reported already processed efficient manner. would anyone want take system already streamlined divert factors? seem like wise decision. CDC vast experience extrapolating data quickly sharing information health care providers give level care needed also plan prepare incoming health concerns. make sense seems like ""red tape"" added already complex problem. disagree. vaccine would available US. 

Just people don‚Äôt want good news. They‚Äôd rather live cycle misery.  suspicion skipped math classes starting preschool. judging, knows circumstances were. 

Anyway, video may help. internet friend, find lots similar resources.  anti-science garbage.

DNA amplification reliable well understood.

This tortured logic HIV deniers relied upon years.

PCR gold standard. comes back negative that‚Äôs one way another matching strand didn‚Äôt make sample.

because virus cells got caught swab, sequence didn‚Äôt match, etc.

They could probably get positives lavage, that‚Äôs brutal harmful.

EDIT: fairness, anecdotal said. parents tell nobody wears masks their--relatively liberal Georgia--town. said, understand furious this.  Absolutely agree you. another excuse though. Gen x,y,z millennials ones social media dependent, intellectually lazy, self-centered re: Covid. boomers, like older generations get bad rap, fact boomers ones brought end Vietnam war, gave women employment cach√©, opened many social barriers. know I‚Äôm shopping on!! alone shop, taking mask pretty safe, especially briefly. virus transmit primarily droplet, lesser extend aerosol, need certain concentration aerosolized particles air risk infection become significant. clients already left room, viral concentration would dropping (most aresol particles small droplets heavier air). room talking, concentration would rising, spend long time room without mask may eventually inhale enough particles get infection. look case studies especially Chinese restaurant case study, several waiters close primary case, spend long presence inhale enough droplets result infection. Others tables shared less time together also get infected, though pathway. **Successful Infection = Exposure Virus x Time,** see risk management information.

As apartment hallway, risk tolerance. Theoretically someone coughing hall right entered expelled large amounts droplets, may enough lingering virus air cause infection, quite unlikely. best knowledge, two cases people may gotten infected air someone left behind, neither study reliable: Hunan bus study retracted, Chinese American elevator study unlikely chain transmission (for example, suspected primary case never swabbed positive). Late gate, might improve fate hahahaha

fauci literally said masks dont work 180d

you idiots look stupid wearing mask ""fight virus"" dangerous normal flu. snicker every time see someone alone car alone bike ride outside w/ mask on. ppl hiding everything weakening immune systems point common cold gonna kill soon!

government's taint taste good you?

unless youre old preeixisting conditions fine

also hospitals places pretty empty. ever happened ""flattening curve?"" flatlined now. cases testing, mortality rates stayed roughly dropped. 

unless live NY democrat governors killing bunch old ppl putting covid ppl nursing homes w/ non-covid ppl, location's overall mortality rate changed much prior years...as covid ""deaths"" also normal deaths ppl happen covid...

dying w/ covid covid two entirely different things.... understanding causation hard ppl apparently Finally *affected. hope God native English speaker. Fox people's brains? understand impeachment works? Quick simple summary one paper folks remember anything 8am bio classes 25 years ago. paper particularly important addresses question ""since antibodies seem fade quickly, everyone get reinfected?"". 

Good News 1 - People previously exposed see cell responses COVID, even longer antibodies.

Good News 2 - small handful people SARS, good go! cell reactivity COVID happens earlier infection. 

Weird News - People previously uninfected either SARS COVID also cell reactivity COVID. seem come coronaviruses give us colds, *speculation* animal coronaviruses regularly infect humans get us sick. sure ties lower incidence severe cases children.

Potentially Bad News - (Not paper, implied.) antibodies fade quickly, nice cell reactions, vaccines development may need ensure promote cell response. 

(I one people slept 8am bio classes, luckily sister immunologist. knows bio, know reddit.)

Edited include original paper here: Countries could‚Äôve learned Taiwan others handled exceptionally well, yet there‚Äôs little coverage. Perfect, that‚Äôs trying understand. Thank told employer feel safe. response ""I CARE!""

Funny, heard manager. words, meaning quite plain. Learning CCP...  Russia also DDoSing healthcare infrastructure beginning pandemic. Whatever say. I‚Äôll continue part wear mask, social distance follow local ordinances. I‚Äôm tired media manipulating information mean I‚Äôm denying pandemic. Get yourself.   business world figures get back ""business"" masks. anti-mask morons done. talk coworkers face face office, IM. In-person meetings, etc.

Its possible acknowledge WFH necessary many right acknowledging drawbacks. single parents. vast majority families can't survive income one spouse. despicable people forced situations. don‚Äôt shop Walmart plebeian. however contact mid level manager access training material Walmart, guess says book administered so-called health ambassadors? virus political issue. validity become politicized. Like 98% tests conducted coming back positive regardless circumstance. Lies everywhere told everyone people want country burn. Disease Control literally name? conveniently miss part say everybody world spewing misinfo purpose want economy fall?   thought process behind someone wears mask, nose? socially distances, takes elevators? wears gloves, touches face? like Florida governor, wore mask one glove, took mask cough bare hand? ignorant, stupid, what? Like China... Must easy criticizing people hold serious offices actually real powers. nightmare scenario. 

It minor one. 

On upside Sunday looked N.O.A.A. Tropical depression report. Atlantic clear way Africa. Please tell many Walmart customers died since you‚Äôre expert subject. you‚Äôre it, many people caught died Walmart customers spread them?

Oh wait forgot, none real.

140,000 dead gives shit, hasn‚Äôt effected me! argument made cloth masks lieu real protective medical masks? Yes, it‚Äôs city mainly known UF rather university pre existing large metro area like Miami! think that‚Äôs really helping us. Although get kicked workspace today current rotation it‚Äôs covid ward....yikes. safe space chaos üò¢ lol. yuge went CVS June 29th. told 2 - 4 days. Took 7 days total get results. log Minute Clinic, click Health tab top Test Results.

It available. already long-term elevated heart rate. want worse. Strictly speaking, positive news always gets downvoted. negative news (and negative comments positive news) gets much attention positive stuff may well getting downvoted.

If someone got information sub (and suspect lot people do), they'd convinced virus kills permanently disables people get it, regardless age. They'd also hyper-sceptical positive news unfounded criticisms it. said, disagree. Certainly right though ability sure view certainly tells enough confident argument. charging taxpayers tests via government. think medical provider anything free USA, boy, got story you. saw title, thought either Peculiar Harrisonville it‚Äôs west side state. Damn ignorant hicks. Looks like starting see effects latest surge here, really surprising one seated masks ordered last week. far fewer casual/impromptu conversations bounce ideas people work remote.

Far overrated era open offices everyone packed like sardines wearing headphones deal noise. /r/iamsmart

We know face Shields/guards don‚Äôt replace masks. clearly don‚Äôt severe COPD. Ban visitors can't behave. Fuck 'em. Nah. Reddit actually good place people disagree debate yes sometimes argue. way civil sides aisle say subs could communicate in. every sub reddit differing opinions banned we're left echo chamber shithole place today. K kids? know kids make crapload mistakes whether 21 12 right. Angry/mad/kick house yea..but disowning? 
That means longer consider person family member... im sure even dad recovers would forgive son eventually. something stupid accidentally infected whole family, purposely try infect whole family. Thank reply.  need him, knows do, accept BS save people, that's real integrity!!! Except gets it, she'll infect...

...you know what? Forget it. understand saying, I've deal attitude, too.

Godspeed. happened original account? 
Also would ever want purchase reddit account, explain logic Children still superspreaders, high risk Covid. still catch spread disease, rate adults.  It‚Äôs tough. Keep mind children likely won‚Äôt even remember this, plenty time preschool, kindergarten, beyond socialize. Lots us boat. begun. That's one way over-generalize point absurdity order discredit group people disagree politically.

The reality side box paper masks come explicitly ""This product ear loop mask, product respirator provide protections COVID-19 (coronavirus) viruses contaminants.""

But know, that's misnomer I'm sure! mention many people wear mask intermittently/incorrectly, touch day long, large amounts facial hair making ineffective. TSA-level security theater point. ""Look me, I'm helping! I'm *so* safe!""

You likely get COVID breathing in. infinitely likely get touching contaminated surface (including mask) face. Medical experts confirmed this.

Now fine you, decide want wear mask. That's totally fine everyone evaluate risk. demand people wear something people even properly, something that's marginally effective... absurd. shaming, form control, become symbol.

And that's point. Forcing people wear masks virus 2-3% mortality rate absurd, practice basic hygiene social distancing.

COVID not, I'm going sneeze on/at people. COVID not, I'm going properly wash/sanitize hands. COVID I'm going keep safe distance people.

The masks almost become religion silly. provided link someone says exact things regarding response. sites analysts scientists also think Tcell response great risk. Obviously need lot relevant information, Merck CEO right caution people. wish could this, financially option. wish luck though, get shit show country still can! Yeah, let‚Äôs go based let rip population... scares situations like get mild case jsut going ""double down"" belief hoax. Recovery freedom. never mentioned asking police anything. people physically restrained entering premises health reasons, go well court. work home improvement store nothing enforce state's mandatory mask law. customers come tattle customers wearing masks ask going it, absolutely nothing bro, I'm cashier dont get paid enough get involved, I'm told, nothing gonna huge, might make special subdivision: /r/PublicWalmartFreakouts  Maga trash. hope guy got arrested unlike guy Kansas. Lying? experience different yours? Calm F down, angry. guy moron. ""We mask shamers"". Yeah let's pretend virus killing people, destroying respiratory system. go restaurants spread disease healthy people PERSONAL FREEDOM took stats class college, 67 sample size 137 population would yield 95% confidence level 9% margin error. mean anything? regurgitate formula Alternative facts. Hippocratic Oath knows administration Unashamedly would much better word context... Don‚Äôt even need read first lines. Coronavirus pandemic *will* get much, much worse. Wear fucking mask do.

But nobody listens either. There's targeted harassment *and* gaslighting mass downvoting harassing. It'd one thing got harassed speaking basically every critic Swedish strategy Reddit elsewhere. Look Swedish thread subject, critics get mass downvoted called sorts names. extremely consistent. point NYC cases country (except US obviously) worlwide. Agreed. Good thing Walmart making masks mandatory stores. Expect LiveLeak YT vids hit goes effect :) ...how democrats blame republicans refusing pass bill, exactly? Yes, I‚Äôve worried Florida / Gulf hospitals people monitors vents ECMOs basic gadgets requiring electricity ‚Äî there‚Äôs bad hurricane, know hospitals generators kick *instantly* keep going week? Walmart even using greeters pandemic? kinda like Germany least two cities currently spend time in. see lot tough looking types entrance cleaning baskets wagons.  girl duck tape applied mouth. scroll along whenever trump toadies r quoted. lies incoherent nonsense. Got you. True Finland 59 deaths per million, Sweden 549 deaths per million. Also we've spend little time Springfield, MO summer Springfield publish local paper locations newly infected people visited. Kind free-for-all contact tracing. Every. Single. One. Lists Wal-Mart. really don't. give reason should? stupid you? one going care die, see reason care others.  I'm similar boat. governor recently made masks mandatory public counties cases exploding right now, punishable $30 fine.

The number people Facebook threatening murder police officers $30 crazy high. outright say murder cops say they'll open carry gun instead mask, DARE people force mask them.

All this, mask. second amendment. ""I think things ok, think won‚Äôt.""

I that. priority list shifts lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I know quote like normal. wrong? one found odd there's almost bad news vaccine candidate. seems odd given timelines, pressure, etc. always picture mask haters punchable faces. I‚Äôm exact boat someone household positive Hey, lived Gainsville years back 70s!

Does surprise Gainsville better rest FL. Big university = intelligent population = better compliance. Riots Walmart 3... 2... 1... GO! appreciate restaurant least right thing. Mine decided discourage testing altogether play ask, tell game. fever? problem. Managers actually try cut tell symptoms, evade regulations put back line. im Colombian. respect, understand talking about. cartels never ""nice people"" ""basic moral codes"". monsters. mutilate still keeping inch death think get ransom money. I‚Äôm curious ‚Äúlast possible second‚Äù look like considering there‚Äôs nothing actually stop herd immunity eventually happening. states become okay hundreds thousands deaths let keep piling up? Great. Now, get customers cover mouths noses said masks. Dumbfucks everywhere... see windows us help cause wanted save money.  fun frame market steadily increasing hand-in-hand Biden's chance winning election. market loves Joe! Saying now, need get big bouncers actually enforce this, like nightclub would have. idiots going listen teenagers old people manning doors saying ""pretty please wear one"". Anti-maskers gonna act like whining toddlers unless real consequences. like power trip otherwise empty pathetic lives. body ready. put spoiler alert bro. cool... Hahaha goodness hearts! 

Narrator: hahahhahahahha hearts!!, uh hum excuse me.. hearts. Couldn‚Äôt happened nicer AntiVaxxer believe wearing mask ridiculous . make drunk driving personal choice demonstrated literally zero people would virus/be spreading virus/contracting virus dumb Stitt waiting sources go verify BRO, doubt it. Every Walmart went northern California week signs everywhere saying wont allowed mask. However %90 people workers one Survived far actually mom texted last week ask recommend go virtual senior year: said thought would safest option-- he's unusual kid. He's kid kids dont impulse control stupid things. protect them.

In words, kids Kevin extent.

(Frankly, schools actually open planned, see could stay open---at point staffing become issue-- dining missing likely mute: everyone miss out.) could also opt face shield, argument valid them.  also assuming testing prioritized worst shape. states (Texas, Florida Arizona) reporting 25% positive rates looks like they‚Äôre testing worst cases. Yeah, mean, avoid skinhead look lol. Wear BLM hat cover bald! Solutions! bald approached Nazis. Win-win book. promise? Sofa king Todd did. enforce it? Home Depot doesn't.  case.

The reason Trump upset Fauci Fauci getting better press attention Trump, Fauci's longer keeping mouth shut danger increasing.

Most remarks news today Federal news conference team meeting, they're speech interview Fauci Georgetown University.  press following Fauci says people interested interested Trump.

They're ignoring him, opposite.   1.6% IFR if

We really need vaccine ASAP!  families won‚Äôt. know sucks, someone pension would concern. relative told news feed announced would announcing shut down. that‚Äôs case, wonder might be? ü§î Walmart door greeters 90% old army vets completely ready stop taking shit people. children already long term damaged born idiotic fox-news watching parents. He's two weeks point. imagine Walmart workers preparing scenario like day. Imagine motorized scooters filled Karen‚Äôs barreling towards you.

If someone snags pic make sure caption . Tanks move Normandy colorized circa 1944 US? Nova Scotia little mask usage. .... virus attacking Americans hates freedom. solution see full invasion COVID-ISTAN US military private contractors. Texas Arizona increase cases, federal government sending military doctors FEMA morgue trucks? Seems like lot money government spend crisis real. Something needs done fact Fox News spent 6 months everything convince people take precaution virus killed half million people worldwide, 130+ thousand people domestically, potential kill millions people take precautions. 

They've informed misinformation spread cause death.

They've consciously chosen spread misinformation cause death. one producing virus, would come from? think said you. one ever said Europe wasn‚Äôt hit hard early. point situation getting better getting worse. due testing. It‚Äôs equivalent participation trophy, lol actually provide proper masks employees. saw employees wearing bandanas.  cousin thinks exactly that. ya know entire family high risk category. I'm Anemic, mom dad diabetic, dad like 57-58 years old, mom severe asthma. wonders I'd get mad wearing fucking mask cries I'm genuinely angry would want risk life along family's lives. live Denmark, pretty close German border. allowed go Germany shop, many Danes do. Germany mandatory wear mask stores. That's fine, problem me. 

So daughter went last weekend, mask all, realize single employee stores wearing mask. asked one about, said: ""I know. employees, guess"". WTF? Nice! Let‚Äôs open em up. Uhm, actually count dead, count people died within 30 days infection. Perhaps try system, surely help numbers. Great news...but many months late?! Imagine thinking idiot ever admit they're wrong. people think they're reincarnation Einstein. Use inspiration better yourself. can't control assholes, control life. First error, basing day reporting instead day death. Meh, cdc wrong/misleading couple things 5 months ago therefore everything say ignored now.

There big difference saying people wearing level professional people completly ignoring basic rules wearing chin ways mouth and/or nose covered. wear mask cover mouth nose expert care make willful decisions ingnore rules. like telling someone need eat vegetable cooked get sick deciding eat raw anyways. Noone expects know cook level chef, understand must cooked way. walmarts Florida armed guards stationed around TP paper towels start this, would even escort TP/Paper Towel shelf-stockers shelves. Trump following ccp footsteps reporting cases soon! clearly insane obviously undermines integrity daily case data US CDC getting data. question surprisingly people addressing naturally comments:

**What National Guard equipped result better compliance hospitals requirement report new cases daily?** gonna hold fuckin' mailroom gun point? confess I'm well read kinds things National Guard trained equipped do, even things would guess they're capable scream ""experts data reporting compliance"". power change it. Voting nothing. shift wealth important address. MAY be? Interesting, mine Nashville already does. maybe 3 people stationed spot denying people entry two uniformed security guards assume people get pissed. fuck take 5 months people figure out? Jesus fuck.

Source: I'm Canadian. r/TrumpCriticizesTrump Wow thought 12 days waiting results bad! 

In California, scheduling testing appointments 2+ weeks 7-14 days results. Easy spread virus entire time still test negative active (these tests active infections antibodies) Last couple weeks talking hospitalizations rising predicting deaths rise soon. Last days talking requesting refrigerated trucks anticipation higher deaths. actually seeing higher deaths. Two months ago I'd agreed you, but...none money Fed printing actually making hands consumers. inflation (as traditionally defined) really happening. real inflation happening terms assets - basically that's happening people already rich getting rich, becoming increasingly harder join club. price bread circuses still pretty much same. little, late. starting Monday? immediately? FTA: days after, health officials contact-traced 139 people exposed stylists asked self-quarantine two weeks. None reported feeling sick 14 days followed salon appointments. researchers also offered clients free diagnostic tests coronavirus. **Sixty-seven** accepted; rest declined. tested, turned negative. Correct One year Moderna Oxford work. really trying keep safe wouldn‚Äôt leave house. We‚Äôre expecting 99% world carry burden 1% sure would cool guts this, ohhhh dunno... months ago?

But go ahead close barn door well horses ran off. Better late never, guess. kept las Vegas mostly hunky dory: safe, quiet, clean corporations took over. Sure might've backroomed people broke knee caps/ knuckles, occasionally found hole somewhere desert, Las Vegas considered one safest cleanest cities America. time, half year, millions infected, hundred thousands died, finally realized need face mask want wear described outfit go shop Wal-Mart. talking per-capita death rate. enough. America #1. want 100000 per day. thought case already. Wal-Mart mandates going door. Yeah they're whackados like went, unmasked, protest purpose protesting stay home orders like back june. 400 people town like 10k. 

Also sister us fly youngest nephew back lockdowns started visiting mom sister didnt know they'd survive pandemic.... course went church spent time dad wear mask anything. CULT.  argument weak ‚Äúright‚Äù establishment like bar either. 

I problem bar mask rule. Let decide customers make decisions go based info. even problem bar wants allow smoking, loathe cigarettes. city (in Florida) already mandatory mask ordinance place, posted outside big box stores, still see tons people blue collar places like Home Depot &amp; Lowes wearing them. enforced make sense.  would thought wearing mask would cause massive uproar political debates.

In country face covering anyway, specifically mask. makes much easier, snood type thing use winter anyway cover nose, easy use too. heat many burning jack lanterns scary costumes scare away...

Menards one them. Newhan get people even going theaters. None big studios releasing blockbusters. Keep ignoring biggest problem, young people urban areas going back bars, restaurants, parties without taking precautions. funny many adults childish wearing mask! tradition Swedes drink denmark. honestly pathetic companies enfocring mask policies months crisis started gov't mandated federal level.

It makes sense realize unenforced mask mandates corporate PR posturing. neighborhoods low 10% population infected, broadly across city around 26%.""

Kudos pointing accurate figures. conclusion virus going spread widely still stands, important point. Yes, admit United Statesian roll tongue way Canadian Brazilian does. would fine N95s available. Unfortunately ""essential"" still work, 90% coworkers wearing masks, despite county mandate have. Mandate put said enforced...so nothing changed. wear mask day work, know cloth protects others yourself. Sounds like great way small businesses get rid competition heard national guard deployed back March kinda thought that's going do. Enforce policies place like masks. armed soldier store telling put one probably see many people refusing. Mass production Sept? even started Stage 3 trials yet... largest longest trial even done then. never denied virus exists. put words mouth. I'm saying people would much better keeping jobs instead tanking economy. difficult choice ultimately economic impact put people way worse situations kept things opened.

It might Darwinism stage.  US Education system, Sports vastly important education

Many HS multi-million dollar sports fields money science labs, quality computer labs, good field trips museums, art music programs erased - 

but look pretty new $6 million HS Football Track field one town goes (other parents). Better ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù. lets see death rates broken geography race  LOl ten years late?? 'Happy 300,000 cases Florida!' 

-Love California

'See next week 400,000 case club!'

-Love New York ignore block moronic troll. arm security front, isnt going easy... although wearing damn mask easy least taking vaccine signifigantly direct consequences fringe antivaxxers Yep. 

and would go court would argued isnt legitimate safety requirement, masks, implemented 7 months virus started spreading *dont qualify*. 

ADA doesnt provide *blanket* exemption dont underestimate it, ADA deems right live less important service dogs enter public place (if deadly dog allergies such) 


Masks wont win anything matter important deem them, likely judge would simply say social distancing appropriate accomodation - ironically already done make masks illegitimate safety requirement operate safely without them. claim cant, congratulations getting casino shut down. figured 15,000 blip either error backlog, help still 10k today still going even one normal rate. feel like PR anything. ""See, WalMart cares!"" truly gave shit would actually enforce now, hire bouncers inside outside stores, wait Monday start it. Sounds ridiculous this, people proven absolute selfish fucking babies wearing one. 6 months late. blatant negligence, talking eugenics point? :( Yup, it‚Äôs mandatory kids go school (good thing) pandemic almost mitigating measure idiotic (bad thing). Certain breed politicians forcing issue insane (evil thing). they're anything like managers used work for, already got numbers speed dial Remember hold phone horizontally vertically filming folks. true. still beaches hiking trails parks basically everything outdoors. closed stay home order.  state populated many people seem done everything opposite done control virus control. Wonder overwhelmed system overwhelmed? meant chokepoint  dont support people wishing death others. incivility Holy shit, someone‚Äôs gonna firebomb walmart within week Damn felt one. love Humboldt Fog Whole Foods. 29.99 pound goat cheese haha science based plan. whole division CDC devoted exactly scenario. whole job develop science based plans. dozens different scenarios.

Trump dissolved division years ago Obama created it. put 6 year old charge shaving younger brother's head. know vast majority people Covid even realize it...right? shit. Yep, google search bar knows better closest friends family. Took long enough I'm sure going work really well rural areas there's people wearing mask are. predict Walmart quietly quit enforcing ""nationwide"" store's sales plummet, picked nearly every big box store area. [Coronavirus likes won't. used to, roomate still does, work Walmart. I've NEVER worked company gave less shit employees Walmart. wish every fucking store would strike unionize. Fuck Walton family, hope get Covid choke ventilators. gotta preface comment antivaxer! actually expected see antivax rhetoric said that, that's said. important pro-vaxers reasonable expectations timelines, appear expectations reasonable yet. 

Regardless, saying ""I'm Antivaxer, [insert antivax sentiment]"" PC way antivax days, given demonized movement become. I've seen many antivax comments start way. totally missing point, please carry economic collapse theories ... Same. run outside keep 15-20 feet away anyone. run that‚Äôs pretty easy do. need wear mask outside maintain safe distance others household. Masks waste money. pull shirt mouth.  dude, earlier year decided grow hair lower back would anyway. It‚Äôs like wearing blanket head 90 degree weather refuse cut cause it‚Äôs almost there. thing is, *can* hide numbers. you, anyone looking, control *official* narrative use talking point.

If lower official death rate, reduce official testing positive rate, reassign bunch COVID related deaths ""heart attacks"" (from COVID related heart damage), ""aneurysms"" (from COVID related blood clots), ""pneumonia"" (you get picture), etc gives talking points. go TV say ""look leadership saved country got corrupt CDC way"". Anyone wants know truth spot obvious lie, ones want believe (and disturbing number people *want* believe) use official story cover. Smallpox: ""*Hold scabs*"" article ""masks dummies"" thrust around people, chin. 

There's analysis repeated / cycles outside away people. Making popcorn watch inevitable tirade videos going occur Walmart's across country. Probably fewer people die way.  pretty thing say likely accurate. ‚ÄòThunder Karen‚Äô would tell ‚Äúyou right stay home honey ‚Äú...

Screw people. Authorities make work covid wards like they‚Äôre countries refuse emergency medical care.

Stay healthy, stay safe, protect yourself.  No, liability optics. Buy stock r/publicfreakout now! Buy buy buy! hate say this, average Walmart worker, it‚Äôs probably effective What? Source helping design strategy please. know maths/statistics professor epidemiologist Oh homeless. Got it. virus taken notice oblige sure... Get ready videos, gonna wild videos.... remembered history ***the star striped plague*** That‚Äôs nice Walmart. needs enshrined national law. hopefully Biden administration make happen.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. means anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks ‚Äî something identify real risk raised enemies society science. 

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people ‚Äúenemies‚Äù progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. individuals employed government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress. Americans know riot unfortunately. I'm sure Walmart corporate focus grouped variety uniforms across various dimensions friendliness effectiveness decided black polo is.  also number people abusing medical exemption rule. try give people benefit doubt, start fight it, come fuck on. ruin people actual medical complications exploit disorders. like breathing. Cue influx Karen videos oK, thanks clarification...I totally agree Karen compilation marathon Youtube recently number Karens bitching masks astounding. Feel already bad employees. lol looks like comment got removed read. Well, hope you‚Äôll forgive wishing man‚Äôs death allowing people die like mean nothing. Seemingly you‚Äôre chill actual murders, alright. know grusome say ... I've enjoying Costco freakouts can't fucking wait walmart ones. 

""I feel threatened, feel threatened"" 

I hope walmart actually enforces though. 

* wear mask enter store 
* mask MUST cover mouth nose times within store
* take mask must leave.
* ""medically exempt"" send someone store you.

Fuck half-measures shit. Enforce it. posting history big yikes Dude you‚Äôre straight wrong this. offer REASONABLE accommodation letting people without ppe would violating main legal responsibility employee‚Äôs right safe work environment.

If offer curbside service would reasonable accommodation therefore offer literally zero circumstances required allow unmasked individuals store link breakdown?    That's unfortunate surprising. I'm attorney employers primarily concerned risks employees getting infected. mean practical risks (suddenly healthy employees) liability risks (being sued employee, customer, client) partly preparation. 

I work large testing lab UK. beginning pandemic could test 200 day. Partly levles staff equipment, also shortage reagents, lab consumables etc. got 4 months later easily handle 1600 tests day processing average time around 8 hours arrival lab report sent electronically.

Though Reddit, contact people similar jobs throughout US, seems places like Arizona, issues back March.

the TLDR is: labs would able actual test 4-6 hours - everything else gets way.  Naw man, know? anti-maskers gonna BOYCOTT Walmart NEVER go again! Keep politics shopping!

/s Guess sold soul devil. sure fear anything this, bravery help sick. Also dealing problem emotionally shows fully understand situation in. new study Proceedings National Academy Sciences indicates people comply social distancing guidelines better working memory capacity, indicator intelligence.

What's hard understand? literally first paragraph. /r/PublicFreakout trash now, half videos public half freakouts. half mods automods inactive accounts.

Go /r/ActualPublicFreakouts instead Please urge boycott. places damn crowded idiots understaffed safe.  Sam's Club requiring masks least couple months now. remember seeing people without masks inside (although I've seen pulled nose) think must even enforcing pretty well. Disclaimer: also cautious believe kids spread covid RIP Walmart greeters. Hire work bouncers bars closed. I'd take thousand angry Karen's single immuno-compromised mother losing life day Change names statement applies likely 90% world business. people wear mask? mean keeps safer. *are part Canada maybe 1 100 people wearing mask Walmart, almost everyone wearing one Costco across street. bizarre. onus isn‚Äôt me. You‚Äôre one claiming weren‚Äôt. prove it.  stupid comment. Larger Walmart needs open entrances.

It fucking make sense pushing large crowds one fucking mazed door. incivil wish death others? really? People believe stupid-ass study's may risk brain cancer, study says Well, comment got deleted lol, hateful incivil. saying deceitful video game character far preferable reality I'd take options point.  Wait now?!? Germany wear kind establishements since months lol makes frustrated sad bad USA handled irreparably country‚Äôs fortunes tied it. can't wait see posts r/PublicFreakout Problem sometimes get smart kids stupid adults, smart kids mostly grow smart adults smarter smart kids, smart kids often smarter stupid adults, know intelligence all/end good life choices, stupid adult fairly mature calm temperament good influences may make better decisions smart kid age appropriate maturity and/or factors even playing field ( bad influences, mental illness, you), barring major life upheaval smart kid go make better decisions stupid adult, least average. Add mix damaged adults get positions authority bossy bullies many interactions like lead smart kids thinking adults stupid, lying control freaks even factors governing power dynamics emerge. like said, you‚Äôre mentally lazy asses situation particular facets. Step bodies goto work? must brillant thought like people live small town Missouri. went Walmart weekend. 2 guys wore masks. guys fatigues. going get crazy! benches watch, right? early years Bush Administration, linguistic consultant Frank Luntz focus grouped alternative terms ""global warming"" public would find less alarming, would thereby quell public's appetite action issue. ""Climate change"" least alarming name, that's phrase entered lexicon nearly replaced ""global warming."" 

Climate local. climate Arizona different climate Maine. change change, good bad, imply direction. ""Global warming"" lays issue uncertain terms. ""Climate change"" obfuscates meaning confuses issue. Nowhere earth seeing average temperatures decrease. earth getting hotter, that's problem. Describing adjective implies local rather global consequences replacing specific ""warming"" nonspecific, neutral ""change"" successful Republican wordsmithing. positive outlook! Again: ""diplomatic crisis""? definition ""diplomatic crisis"" 
  


&amp;#x200B;

#  Yep, I'm Wisconsin well infuriating little people seem care here. I've gone Walmart times groceries essential items time seems like less less people wearing masks. feel bad Evers pushback receives every time he's tried something help keep us safe. Well pretty well cements America‚Äôs plan politicians fully control pandemic response. 
We seeing hints (ok, sometimes smack face obvious) along way science language choose speak tackle this. 
With data funneling straight corrupt government‚Äôs hands, assured going forward data untrustworthy. 
Basically, happened Florida data demanded state falsified happen national level. 

I‚Äôm left wondering true flow data though. 
Obviously either starts @ hospital test center. 
Do directly funnel results CDC? 
Or, run first state government reside in? 
I hope see transparency still future, see falsification step forward unveil it. 

... ashamed country become - rather, proven be. option please? Lol near you? Menards HQ WI WI isn‚Äôt wearing masks. great point , maybe real reality disease something people live largely virtual / digital lives appreciate. Hence "" personally know anyone sick Rona?!"" posts .  many us talk neighbors ask ispreads comunity , little social bubbles / spheres something many us in-tune . waiting 5 days implement? mandatory ASAP. Study finds certain group associate may may intelligent. give door, drop door , free Walmart. (gloves too)

then enjoy consumer confidence new levels.

having said that, (slips mask, signs fk reddit day) cannot give blood. spoke HR things,, including failure people keep masks on. told mask wearing still controversial. said brains ass, maybe. 

This told someone wear mask around minutes later told article bus driver beaten death telling people wear mask. Probably 3 weeks deaths peak, assuming transmission actually stabilized. 

Arizona's death reporting running quite bit modeled that's concerning. doctors nurses never wore begire n95s invented either. / s. Come doctor, older clearly remember medical professionals wearing cloth masks. fun. comment disingenuous best safe word ""squiggle"". long health system Florida workers stop showing up? Karen‚Äôs furious u die first get posthumous diagnosis, thats reduced spread, there‚Äôs always silver lining

/s Florida man gonna throw gator. Put respect name think good required wear face masks. still traumatized months ago old man coming talking trying talk walked away.

As run/walking away heard gurgling sound throat much phlegm throat finish sentence.

I bet man phlegm knows talked cashier spewing kinds germy particles. Goldman STELLAR good stock market. Dead people move needle like big ass quarterly earnings!

 mean right? Contracting COVID foregone conclusion point. What‚Äôs motivation Gov? People continue local Walmart: claim health condition prevents wearing masks. 40% county mysterious condition. say enforce it? Walmart town said last week-all customers must wear mask. went store many many folks wearing masks. asked said enforcing policy making customers wear masks.  Doesn‚Äôt make sense make policy going enforce it. already feel people‚Äôs freedom violated. Poor Karen. /s still people flat believe virus real plot make sure president doesnt get another term.

Somehow people also think told wear mask start communism. army elderly people front doors enforcing this?? set remind comment couple months ago. Still think hundreds thousands deaths? good girl? good girl!! xD Corporations dictate real government country I‚Äôm skeptical Moderna. They‚Äôve never brought anything market successfully seem habit releasing news inflate stock

Oxford one watch IMO  Spanish flu pandemic heavily politicized well arguably even pandemic. WWI ongoing time, Wilson administration straight lied American people severity telling people garden variety influenza effort keep morale high.

Other Black Death, Spanish flu pandemic worst public health crisis recorded history. also smallpox epidemic 1520 could probably give run money, COVID shaping nowhere near deadly Spanish Flu. I'm trying deny worst pandemic century, I'm surprised Fauci said this. Holy hell thats like making McDonalds customers get diet coke. not, severe cases. CDC even says 8 10 recover within days. claimed deaths goi g yday. day Florida records highest deaths. made sense. People idiots Yep day started limiting amount people inside Walmart like Black Friday busy, parking lot completely full.....Yet nobody waited line get in. already rule? ""rapid"" testing lot places now, results less hour Wear mask go infect place. That's suck wear day. Thanks service. Humans survive weeks without food. Stock go survival mode. Tom Hanks live island years, go months Hard disagree. situation large community spread limited testing testing many asymtomatics, people contact confirmed cases, overall people still community.

Unfortunately anyone hospital symptoms assumed positive. need catch people spread more.

In New York virus first starting make sense test hospital patients directs care. don‚Äôt luxury right Yeah, that's heard. That‚Äôs still 300,000 dead Texans. we‚Äôre exceeding expectations far. Danger pay? Sorry best twitter post calling heroes - corporate adults take something seriously, young people chance it. sell MAGA masks door $4.97. didn‚Äôt end well watching Nick Miller new girl studying self hair cuts YouTube came say lol. Haha wow. bet you‚Äôre riot parties. Stock market values *directly* connected corporate profits. Prices driven strictly supply demand shares, turn driven variety reasons, logical not. Perhaps will. testament fucked country really is. I'm debating Trump's leadership shitshow. 

I'm simply stating FACT Fauci lied public mask effectiveness April. changed story June. went Morning Shows admitting lied April. 

It's seriously easy math. Ya don‚Äôt say Seems like reused article posted back May
 live european country relativley recently dictatorship. got ordered wear masks. did. explained reason protect people infected know.

Its political here, needs done. baffles us political thing USA. actually used live dictatorship (we number 2 World mass graves) much still around living memory dont consider required wear masks oppression. matter nessecity. plan? Open stuff leave people wear masks. people Walmart crossover episode you‚Äôve waiting summer long for. Majority Walmart customer base type follows store rules...can think example Walmart customers following store rules rules society matter?  considered side coin. makes even worse sickening. Oh yeah. Update two days ago: tested negative! Hooray! I‚Äôm going back work afternoon. fianc√© still waiting results. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs negative too. Ugh. Man. It‚Äôs relief.  darkest timeline. reason socially distance stay away goofy ass redditors promote shit articles like one.

Wait kidding redditors don‚Äôt leave houses say flu still kills more. cant find exact number flu killed year. Deaths lag cases could predicted this? know world ruined people actually make news like actually make ashamed act logically.

Pinnacle human mediocrity. Literally everyone involved Oxford vaccine said since start they‚Äôd end year wtf smoking? Everyone front line worker deserves fat fucking check bullshit put think democrat/republican debate would could actually compare total deaths per state per month compare last year. know source stats. see Tennessee like Brazil, song title would Dead Bodies Everywhere  should. talking company made huge profit pandemic still make sure stores adequately staffed sufficient supplies work with. love ""controversial"" commenters calling BLM protesters also follow conservative Trump subreddits. Typical. [\~60% population US underlying medical That's exclusive club.  paper better. Unfortunately, abstract cover details. US apply Canada well? Ah fuck  almost lost parents COVID sister's ""relax chill"" attitude. seem OK I'm harboring bad feelings towards sister, rightfully stepped daughter game nursed everything. either one died, know could live herself. Probably alienates big part customers: poor Republicans think suffocated mask. feel fine, just, know, danger vulnerable around me, feel fine! even better question went Carter Reagan. Reagan real start national decline we're experiencing. Italian mafia remember right helped fighting fascists, japanese mafia helped earth quake... Gangsters sometimes nice people.  look case study number one, Korean Call Center. kind depends kind AC much coworkers talk   Nah actual corruption plainly stated 2nd 3rd paragraph.

Pennington memorialized parts exchange public contracting document. articles well done, clarify believe point. one recommendation would lead articles. idea they've already thrown up, bit they're lot better put together one posted.

As comment echo chambers, I'll pull one back bit. scanned history saw posts relating football, r/conservatives, subreddit. state TV post led possibly erroneous conclusion. Sorry. Spot on.  one source one region, thanks. others?

 Sk√•ne reopned July 12, two weeks ago smaller regions. Sk√•ne really can't contributing observed rise yet, takes infections show up. #doubt Dealing type pig-ignorance too. :( Hence companies needing stand hire security. Karen would like speak manager üòÇ relevant plenty Karen incidents. Yes words make bad virus go away right? Lmao right. fucking uncertain times people bank stupidity. standard situation would true - however several things different here. pandemic situation easier test vaccines efficacy accelerated pace chances exposed virus high test subjects (in areas infection rates high - that‚Äôs testing Brazil US etc). reason long time lines manufacturing infrastructure - takes time build - remember need vaccine mean needed vaccine production stops. paying production facilities risk meaning manufacturing set way trials complete reduce time significantly. hugely expensive - possible private firm operation warp speed gave ton money companies world big favor - possible insight telling scientists money obstacle go fix damn timeline....  human beings lives futures downvoting comment, consider Diamond Princess roughly 20% infection rate weeks exposure, there's plenty data suggest virus going spread widely anywhere rigorously contained. overall fatality rate, still debatable depends measuring.  Holy fuck, really telling idiotic, snide jokes subreddit's response country dislike developing vaccine. Stay salty. Ah man, thank making day! :D

Please stay safe. :)  starting now? Sounds like niece concealed carry permit carries everywhere. Nothing actually concealed either. tiny walks one hand poised bulge hip like old west shoot out. WTF matter people? used nice kid. Belgium required wear mask grocery stores first US governor test positive? Interestingly, he's [sixth state governors. He'll probably fine.

But probably last governor get it. probably hurting bottom line it.   information false? choose cynical want, WaPo may point yesterday, OP data WaPo article complaining about. data backs press release May. what's problem? Moderna kept mum interim data? middle pandemic everyone mother hoping vaccine? That‚Äôs going fly like lead balloon. Anti mask protesters going shit man. attend small meeting convention center tulsa couple weeks ago? Ive multiple stores signs saying mandatory masks. Lots people enter shop stores mask nothing said done. 

Only couple local places seen really enforced. Geebus thought 13 days lot...  seen soccer that's going month now. Hey, that‚Äôs 2 states. Choose. hope hospitals rational thing completely ignore directive. rural CA county, maybe one ten people wear mask, good day. I've yet even see associates walmart masks on, though 70 percent wear one. danger heart attack covid ever go walmart see everyone masks. yes, always obese otherwise unhealthy looking ones without mask. *sews pandemic achievement badge* side, Initially (March) lack evidence lack recommendations effect. Paired (in opinion) anti-institutional, scolding attitude pro-mask people strongly reminded anti-vax arguments made lean towards trusting official institutions matter. evidence coming properly reviewed changed wear masks indoors distance cannot kept. outside, especially distance others easily kept (say biking work back, going running easily getting close others) still see wearing mask would significant impact. is, long develop cough would manifold droplet/aerosol spread. still see people sharing articles April acting like it‚Äôs gospel. Leadership.

/s say would one day magically disappear... You‚Äôll surprised much engineers particular latch irrational unscientific beliefs. Engineering often encourages black white thinking belief everything answer. 

Cases point: large portion al-Qaeda members engineering degrees. today one biggest COVID skeptics Elon Musk, done hands engineering long time especially Space-X. 

Actual scientists tend less ideological though definitely exceptions. fucking retarded. People dont touch hot stoves may intelligent. Florida Oklahoma's governor [sixth US state governors. Odds he'll fine. Doubt he'll last governor get though. National Holiday named pull off. Definitely. Whenever someone says IQ is, good rule thumb divide 2 get actual IQ. user rocking around 75 likely haha controversial stance. Every retail store policy. Prolonged indoor contact moderately sized crowds decent risk transmission.  think there's gap exposed actually catching it

It's assuming even random distribution cases among population, using binomial distribution, probability one positive 10 trials. That's exposure though, 100 percent chance catching straight exposure wouldnt say Sweden's economy fucked. Japan. 

They dont countless businesses going under, millions new unemployed tons people homeless. $ small mind.  Musk bad orange ass smear. Popcorn time mean strikes worked low skill workers past. Coal miners, factory workers, textile workers, postal service, etc look US labor History ""low skill workers"" back day went strikes unions guess what, days unions. Yeah aint nothing buddy fixing gas lines tanks furance room mate like ima check gas starts lighting lighter around basement make sure lines shut off... yeah... dont know survive. certainly takes load mind associate myself. I'm actually surprised thankful going put someone low paid associates. Came say this. anyone know typical ICU capacity hospitals pandemic was? See... Communism superior form government. That'd put huge burden people like single parents school daycare available care children right now, do, smart enough put kids there. Forcing dump kids places able buy food would move pptential epicenter infection somewhere else.

I'm fine self-enforce social distancing kids unable understand something covering face can't made wear one properly. hit different aisle move on.

It's idiot adults know better real problem. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know governor‚Äôs reasons are, know they‚Äôre wrong..‚Äù Yet demonstrably wrong, saying invalidated reality. fact read twice get doesnt make feel much better it. Fuck. nah we'll pretend going away bypassing cdc transparent reporting processes. Karma. Oklahoma crawling anti-maskers.  went local pharmacy yesterday single employee donned mask physically distanced. 

Via city Mayor's orders, masks *just* went mandatory OKC Tulsa week.  That's I'm saying, like people still wearing masks car. Unless taking passengers probably fine drive without one. Walmart years, makes almost want go back watch... *almost*.   Getting reports water may also wet too. Developing story, stay tuned. *""I know know nothing""*

Socrates Yeah, well, want try get control taking measures so. One measures includes restricting travel place high burden infection. Yes know. wish information shared openly honestly times used scare tactics political reasons.

The truth need...and fine overcount admit may catching cases. However really hard find level detail reports.  Oh shit Hey bad Yukon. Seriously though people keep trying frontier escape thing north can‚Äôt move build cabin especially right now. 
After pandemic come visit people friendly it‚Äôs beautiful here. Don‚Äôt try couple tried though vulnerable First Nation communities Article says though allergies, I've never fever allergies unless sinus infection. get early outbreak, hope people see fever immediately stay home. **Sk√•ne: 1¬†380¬†983**  
 Well early on, hospitals actually listing covid cause death matter what. Tests took days come back waiting.
Now different, probably. maybe people realize that. Whole Foods? Genteel patrons understand comply. 

Walmart? Total Armageddon. Time sub r/peopleofwalmart several months late. least using clippers! neighbor USED wear clippers, amongst corona stuff BLM stuff decided time start BICing head skin... Thank you! I'm 100% pro-vaccine think antivaxxer article. prefaced one thought might anti vaccine. look comment want sound ambiguous conviction. Anyway, concern administration pushing rapid production vaccine bypassing traditional efficacy standards political purposes. scares shit me. ""People ignore social distancing retards""
 
""60,000 people houston marched packed together like sardines 2 weeks later became voracious hotbed virus arguably entire world.""
 
""Hey lets disingenuous here, several dozen people anti-mask protests obviously problem."" Ever heard instacart? Don‚Äôt go grocery store wtf? True, think lot people heading back home country PCP's insurance here. rapid tests either require doctor's approval patient needs show symptoms, I've seen far. Wow... Ontario Canada 24 hour turnaround roughly 20K tested province(same state) daily. Website health card entered get results time alive! reddit freak videos going gold! Portland already required places. based seen would hazard either lying refusing acknowledge issue. way one Trumpiest places planet ""got control"" Oh know that, thank information! I've Walmart since pandemic began. Mask usage pretty good point; particular Walmart required facemask orders, person making sure everybody facemask.

Still stop couple shopping masks protecting chins. Still better response country üëç clearly agenda post bad news find Sweden. 

Looking excess death showed Sweden as/good bad many countries Europe pretend it‚Äôs catastrophe. 
In countries doctors thrown window complaining. articles find good proof free press Sweden works should. /r/insanepeoplefacebook bunch good content stupid people thinking rights violated Yup too. going crazy! fuckin' say!?!? That‚Äôs bad look desperation continually insult glaring. flaws pointed fun, confidence prepubescent mind grow someday. responding, hope last zinger makes feel great inside. gonna get ugly someone enlighten recent reports Florida testing facilities reporting 98-100% positivity rates? reports reflecting actually going on? something missing here? currently enough info verify claims?  lot things country start this.  I'm work WM well, state there's mask mandate already. sheriff town already said make people enforce mandate, effectively kills power people work enforce it. already told people policing dumbasses wearing mask pay grade. obviously want wear since puts co-workers danger, i'm going get fight shouting match douchebags karens. Maybe worker's bodies would stop piling gave workers masks. pretty much exact comment replying to, used extra word ""state"". using word descriptor demographics really overtly political context. way used entirely debatable since based past factual data/#s, word could used ways stir arguments see banned. Ready go hang Walmart day camera... Looks like nazi private sector normalizing basic sanitary practices lowest denominator. local restaurant outside bar often packed one wearing mask. Pictures posted owner feels shame all. reported sure anything done. gonna lie, boom Karen freakout videos one bright spots pandemic. low American standards fallen. Yup  going enforce it? NY already required law employees serious six feet distance give crap people forcing distance wearing masks. Like physically held hand stop guy wearing mask following right behind another person waved took another steps. ever someone spit right face pandemic? I'm high risk complications. May stay healthy. situation LA county good, 10 million people. put perspective, California 39.5 million people. So, almost 25% people California live LA county. According [this someone linked above, per capita daily new cases slightly lower San Bernadino Riverside counties, way lower Imperial county. whole, California #13 per capita cases US. Every building choke zones... Typically doorways. Sometimes off-the-cuff shit ends best. Myself. 

The way think constantly growing evolving culmination past experiences/acquired knowledge/research/mistakes entire overall life experience. one person, entire array past present surroundings.

I'm wrong sometimes like learn it. time I've learned keep mouth shut unless I'm confident I'm right though. far valuable habit that's common nowadays sadly. get deal shit? people attending ""peaceful protests"" mayos Totally agree. 

Edit: Misunderstood originally Teachers enough hands without worrying going die jobs.

Our Government works people, people work government. need change around...masks good everyone super cool look like old time cowboy bandit (depending style mask always add bandana)! Thats going go well Good luck getting another country let in. They're closing borders us. Wait. mandate federal level? Wtf? tests positive yet refuses mandate masks?

Some state leaders take stupidity whole level. worst news since discovery virus itself? Welcome! Either refuse serve impose 'hazard surcharge' wearing mask. 

I think prudent put front line employees risk try enforce policy. many petulant adults looking opportunity throw tantrum play victim. kidding, knew posted this.

Or know, give fuck narrative spin. 5 people like said go back home partying, get contact siblings, parents, grandparents, cousins, roommates, etc...Then siblings go beach weekend, get contact people enjoying vitamin-sea go back home, get contact siblings, parents, grandparents, cousins, roommates, etc... parents take dog walk park dog owners (one couple apartment building got infected joining type dog party among dog owners), go home get contact siblings, parents, grandparents, cousins, roommates, etc...
Now, see problem airborne transmission type virus? weird future can't go bars Walmart enforcing dress codes bouncers. Might well be. know vaccine sceptical people pro-mask initially. know anti vaxxers per se, can't give anecdotes  funny travel internationally, countries requirements like ""You negative coronavirus test performed within 72 hours departure."" hard acquire test get test results back within 72 hours normal countries, US politicized impossible.  Hey buddy, roll stupid town? Native American what's considered rez accent. even mid western twang. I'm South Dakota. sorta weird growing because, accent worse, like refused learn it. option lot friends relatives took.  Auto correct got :) Ideally want get infection rate low contact tracing feasible. way track infections limit exposure actually kill virus. way hell seeing 50k+ cases day. Anyone asymptomatic testing due concern infection self quarantining least 2 weeks get results back. least seems like best practice know interested suspect Corona table free... experience, employers don‚Äôt give rats ass risks healthy employees. situation outlier. company 4 positive cases office far people already back, yet return WFH. they‚Äôve done push last departments‚Äô return dates back 2 weeks. 

They‚Äôre using health department government scapegoat. health department doesn‚Äôt go back recommending WFH whenever possible, something happens blame decision making health department. duty police



My local Sam‚Äôs Walmart months now. I‚Äôm sure locations. Yikes fever sounds extreme, know I've ever temperature high. got tested protests, worried asymptomatic carrier. Good luck whatever is! Governer gets corona... Still mask mandate ""communities Oklahoma different needs""...

Ok, well unless one constituents ""special needs"" getting coronavirus, maybe consider telling wear mask.   stop stupid? Saying vaccines 100% safe always idiotic saying never safe. sister ER nurse John Hopkins Florida almost died flu shot. good health get stronger flu shot part best protect others ended acoma 13 days know would ever wake up. neurological issues 5 years later. discussion labeling better vaccine standards make better case wider vaccination putting people like sister family thru hell back people rushing repeat something dangerous. need better labeling injectables comes inputs methods currently required listed FDA. need vaccines exceptions INCLUDING COVID go thru proper 4 plus year trials mass use. morning coming covid exposure leading high antibody levels leaving infected potentially risk reinfection. would apply antibodies used vaccines cases meaning vaccine like flu well may effective short period time only. far many questions rush untested injectables. must take time full trials ensure long term health safety requiring anything law Around humid heat?  want law says news channel airing show strict recitation facts must banner running times saying ""this segment opinion piece, strictly reciting facts"" similar. hope too! There's many people wearing masks...  Man, seeing states barely implement mask requirements fucking insane, Illinois required since May 1.

The site (ME) tests bring form primary care; exposed relative (asymptomatic time) qualified testing way.

Blue Cross Blue Shield waived deductible/copays associated these, lot insurers cover people working around yet.

Hopefully really-actually-free testing catches on; there's way many people can't afford spend $300 find they're gonna sick.

Edit: [Apparently we're opening free ones HHS I‚Äôm guessing don‚Äôt live poverty-stricken area. unlike CDC's site, HHS database gathering coronavirus information open public, raising concerns transparency.

Also, seem try divide Nordic countries other. that?

Who's Service People Unable Wear Mask Face Covering

Not everyone able wear mask. Please respectful people unable wear one due health, age reasons."" wasnt walmart, guy brandished gun 18 year old cashier BBQ restaurant Kansas City. 

The violence coming. ü§£üòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ Feels like arguing semantics, premise likely wrong quick calculation long would take successful countries reach meaningful level immunity. 500 cases day, takes around five half years million people get infected example.

To me, seems successful countries this:

1. Brought infections level contact tracing keep up, expanded testing capacity parallel

2. Kept infections contact tracing isolation, local measures needed got flare-up

I think Swedes way much respect academic credentials general. I've worked plenty PhDs coder, run surprising amounts incompetence even there. Plural, meaning two. AKA, North South. What's problem? Please Meijer next 

Walmart smells like baby shit BO hate there, Meijer across street.

All people make smell like baby shit BO going flock like go U always leads nation getting job done. going good r/publicfreakout material...  told me? Every sixty seconds africa, minute passes came back work working home 3 months, walked see boss full beard! always short haircut completely shaved. shock looks pretty good actually. Lol  Might reason massive US covid cases. People wear masks because.... Merica. üëç wallmart makes mandatory wear masks? 4 months covid? double food trucks. üòÇ There's lot drawbacks. Team communication suffers. People get tired staring screen day. equipment breaks replacing PITA.

Productivity probably wash. plenty distractions home yes there's commute. right FB Twitter substitutes learning. FB Twitter full *opinions,* facts. it‚Äôs anything like ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù masks county, stores won‚Äôt enforce it. health department won‚Äôt anything. police won‚Äôt anything. idiots win. another person never stood someone else. people treating others complete disrespect, like trump never ass kicked child told everything wonderful, generation similar people. open mouth say something back kid. I'll stand others. Nope. You‚Äôre intentionally ignorant. know situations spread occurs. Parks major factor. Discouraging safe activities drives people unsafe ones. influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill young old, higher survival rate between, Spanish flu pandemic resulted higher expected mortality rate young adults.[5] Scientists offer several possible explanations high mortality rate 1918 influenza pandemic. analyses shown virus particularly deadly triggers cytokine storm, ravages stronger immune system young adults.[6] contrast, 2007 analysis medical journals period pandemic found viral infection aggressive previous influenza strains.[7][8] Instead, malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps hospitals, poor hygiene, exacerbated recent war, promoted bacterial superinfection. superinfection killed victims, typically somewhat prolonged death bed.[9][10]

The 1918 flu deadly disease; deadly conditions around WWI.

This frankly shocking COVID killing many people peacetime vastly improved standard living, food distribution, medical technology. AND, always, grouped tobacco vaping together. made effort study anything, said, ""her der, young people getting sicker"" I‚Äôm sure exactly died, surely didn‚Äôt die massive pipe sticking head, died pipe sticking head. Results inconclusive.  well heres real good Christian question then.. Christian conservatives politically active ever admitted wrong repent public space (only fair considering public wrongs are)? Going major influx karen/maga dimwit videos soon protesting Communist Walmart   Nope. Still unrealistic. 

I think lot states hoping better control virus then. 

The vaccines approved then, let alone mass produced enough make difference local communities. Take bad news opportunity knowledge need protect  Hi Everyone,

I worked video try help folks understand ICU stacking is, see ICUs fill quickly (now USA unfortunately Florida, Texas, parts California from). 

I'm hoping help people understand reinforce important adopt public health interventions: (1) physical distancing socially (2) masking out.

Here's also shorter 2 min PSA version: 

Thank safe! They'll send social workers keep hearing solve every problem have. 

Redditors weird, want people jail wearing mask, think there's even single post site regarding violent criminals released jail covid. Here's example.

High risk rapists, murderers, strong-arm robbers, gangbangers, they're fine tossed back society.

Cali releasing criminals it.

But worry guys. person want wear mask deserves jail. lockdown harder country. harder lockdown, faster recover virus itself. immune system gets confused attacks body. no, Covid-19 virus triggers autoimmune response, deadly ones do. full list causes yet. need wait people get infected, spread virus die think safety measures appropriate? know virus already. need wait. sesquipedalians NEVER that.  sheesh! Temperature checks done infra-red cameras thermometers. Quick zero contact. think trying say thing reading again.

My original point implies cases saw since club cluster caused reliant masks primary mechanism prevent spread (alongside testing &amp; tracing). However due situations wearing masks werent possible, social distancing measures introduced prevent spread (i think weeks ago since Gwanjgu outbreak) seems like working. 4 methods prevent spread masks, social distancing testing &amp; tracing.

Maybe worded incorrectly caused confusion essentially think we're saying thing here. :) chance I'm clicking links, loser.

If they're images, use imgur. Anyone check America‚Äôs Bible Belt? Want make they‚Äôre ok. state like since March. Facemasks required retail stores since lockdown. blows mind entire country like months now.

A vocal minority complain it, one shames wearing mask - opposite. EU literally allowing Americans in, neither Canada Mexico. die unable breathe, reach notepad pen bed side table. last bit strength write ""WE RITE PRAYSE GOD MAGA!""  going enforce this? retired greeter door? Can't wait Karen tantrum videos üëèüëè like we're back middle ages people.

That exactly want. 

If realize gradually losing power want go back serfs kings (and they're white male kings scenario), antagonism towards science power/knowledge shared makes complete sense. Code go elsewhere surgery. People often travel outside United States surgery/dental care even travel, cheaper. Thailand Mexico probably common choice exchange rate quality healthcare. European countries, often Eastern-European, also attract medical tourists.

Honestly, couple news cycles Walmart get make effectively free advertising pass rule like Sometimes feel like whole usa fucking retarded, millions covid cases finally force face masks PROVEN SLOW SHIT DOWN?

I'm litigious person. definitely fan people sue everyone interact with. feeling usually ""move on"". battles need fought. Like bouncing paychecks, bosses need put business hurt anyone else. behaviors egregious must punished. one those.

My thinking employer consult professional follow that. Every province different limitations, speak Ontario. Masks required public transit week two cities, masks recently also required enter public places. Restaurants open takeout patios, bars still closed (although re-open soon part phase 3).

Daycares re-opened 3 weeks ago, precautions: parents allowed inside, dropoff happens outside temperature check, children denied entry sent home show sign sick, staff wear masks face shields, children socially distanced day long individual play areas.

Everyone still working home, civil servants, tech workers.

Playground equipment closed, re-open soon part phase 3.

So overall we're socially distancing much possible, masking possible, slowly re-opening things (cases keep dropping). Huh?.That sounds normal. never dealt anti-mask dipshits? think military recruiting job 20 years Florida..... major city.... 


This national security deconstruction. Dude someone literally going die redneck ""protecting liberty"" Yea, IDK parents going get food anymore. think helped CDC suggested non-sealing masks ineffective

Really, key, damn mistake. Go back start find number reasonable sources making exact arguments, masks ineffective many people even saying increase risk. CDC US Surgeon General said things.

BTW, one stabbing one gun Canada. everyone tests positive today, new positive cases 0 tomorrow! Checkmate! People come mask pull they're store.

Check real news sites item minds. /s 100% positive political? poorly ventilated warehouse, mom runs QA animal feed products. employees wear masks, environment oppressive (humid, hotter exterior temps) keep playing masks becuse feel like cant breathe. also, tiny lunch room everyone pack together eat, obviously without masks. help, overworked, stressed. Great plan.

Mine? Split shifts, 1/3 work home. Masks, 2m apart. 6 lunch room time. One chair per table. Everyday someone takes turn sanitizing whole lab office. Mandatory work home exposed travel. Company insurance waives fee covid testing ordered PCP similar. Overworked stressed.

Hers national US based company running everything lean busted possible. Mine global Norwegian based company, slowly cutting investment NA department.

We fucked. ‚ÄúWell, looks like we‚Äôve gotten test back apparently Covid tested month ago... also two weeks ago died.‚Äù immigrant parents pretty upset news jumped ship another brand. I‚Äôm upset, Rosarita stuff tastes way better lol Unless positive test I'm sure choice. us can't afford get tested every time runny nose sore throat. bad can't grab popcorn lawn chair sit Walmart parking lot watching entrance. Seeing freakouts anti-science crowd would priceless. That's trust works. One big lie time destroy credibility relationships. countries travel bans place US.  stock photo used son fucking ridiculous! look make sure onion. According article they're creating new position specifically confront customers try enter without masks. Hopefully pay addition posting clear signage front stores, Walmart created role Health Ambassador station near entrance remind without mask new requirements. ambassadors receive special training help make process smooth possible customers. ambassadors, identifiable black polo shirts, work customers show store without face covering try find solution. currently considering different solutions customers requirement takes effect July help ensure consistency new process, stores single entrance.  so? wrong about? would hard skeleton crews. coronabeasts us vastly outnumbered. This. know exposed chance testing early get accurate result. tested like two days exposure, week later. wait two days results though, hearing news week 26 days seems insane. I'm sure it'll extended needed, easier slap 2 weeks get door types people also purposefully going make show it. Probably would agree since research vaccine started years ago MERS. 

They start zero; looking vaccine coronavirus quite while. tweaked specific virus recently. discredited many, many reasons. 

There basic errors, including basic math errors. biased sample. Errors basic researchers demanded Stanford research team publicly apologize. 

There sorts ethical issues well.

At time, Stanford researchers refused sign onto study bad, turned funded founder major airline outspoken ""reopen"" pusher (Jet Blue, Stanford research team failed disclose Stanford announced university would investigate researchers study university, also come fire, investigating veteran professors‚Äô research

AND misconduct:

....Even Fithian outside experts alerted team errors within two days publication, researchers promoted findings national media, NPR Fox News.

Without initially disclosing role study, co-author Andrew Bogan published op-ed Wall Street Journal asking, ‚ÄúIf policy makers aware outset COVID-19 death toll would closer seasonal flu ‚Ä¶ would risked tens millions jobs livelihoods?‚Äù Soon, need hospital, screwed. subject matter expert here? credible results? investor looking moderna, unusual trade volume senior exec selling shares. usually good sign meaning bearish final results anyone making case white house take control new surge virus ? countries attacked uniformly successful. we're clearly failing. Trump going sit back watch, blame Dr. Fauci?  40% sample size zero positives HUGE result. 

Odds people didn‚Äôt bother get tested actually caught very, low. don‚Äôt number you, understand it‚Äôs complicated comparing typical usage covid-19 hospitalization usage. 

Let‚Äôs say typical usage 80%. would include beds designated surgeries people coming ailments injuries turnaround 1-3 days. Therefore, majority beds patients rotating daily/weekly basis. 

Covid-19 patients hospitalized stay weeks. majority beds covid-19 patients, hospital provide surgeries usually cannot give care patients typical shorter turnaround days. people stop coming hospital due cancelled surgeries, avoiding hospital due increase covid-19 cases, get flat denied due space. hospital usage may look short bit one group patients essentially replacing another. 

Therefore 80% usage mostly covid-19 patients means less patients seen 2-3 week period compared typical 80% usage time period. 

Once ICU usage hits certain percentage, people covid-19 patients cannot treated ICU usage begin feel consequence‚Äî worst case die home. ignorance making mass murderer. nothing wrong wanting gone. They'll need bigger security stop Karen's Kyle's going without one Ignore, Lie, Blame, Hide.

Betcha Trump continue castigate China ""Transparency"". Yet tests UFC uses events takes 2 days results come back. Capitalism wins again! Exactly point making. exactly thing happening UK too. Far much cronyism seen pandemic.

Focus rather getting caught distasteful advice never followed.  MUH FREEDUMZ!!! Telling Americans early days pandemic wear masks absolutely undermined future messaging. starting think may something seriously medically wrong him. 15000 cases day hands still make statements like move towards normality psychotic Ok real question here. mean Walmarts even small one live? that's case go report everyone wearing mask? Cuz bad like 3 10 people wear mask u wear mask u get harassed people don't. help enforce mask law? probably started affecting customer base employees. Probably pay ton overtime many workers getting sick nobody sub in. hate going bars.

Trump one approved encouraged attack, headline complete lie. think missed nuance response, black white. There's ways get kids socializing also low risk. nephew actually going right now. example, send kids daycare, childcare workers required get vigorously tested. Parents also agree certain testing travel restrictions. mandated nationwide rates go down. government rolls quick free clinics, empowers behavior. people stop going bars wear masks, rates go way down. 

It's nothing, countries it, reason can't. throwing hands saying ""we tried"" couple months childish.

And intention romanticize era. say grand scheme things go wrong (war, starvation, disasters), asking people go bars wear masks small ask. think masks mandatory testing forced certain situations, vaccines forced public schools. soon someone's personal liberties start affect another's health draw line. Cigarette smoking speed limits went debates. mandate like ""no shoes shirt service"" mandate. can't say words 'health condition' allowed business without pants. laws apply here. 

Per American Disability Act, private businesses provide **reasonable accommodations** patrons. come inside store shop. Order delivery, curbside pickup, send someone pick shit up. *don't* get enter business follow rules. mask, entry.

Everyone wear mask couple weeks see shit works!! individual freedoms virus seems getting worse EVERYONE... try work month whatever, go back goober.. spectacular I'll make popcorn bring Diet Coke, bring camp chair best show town! üëç

Edit:Just mask social distancing needed see show!  Compared retail stores jobs, fuck yeah is. Especially area less expensive cost living. especially college degree. Some, yes. think people I'd like admit know really buy arguments. Maybe they're lying themselves. assume began wanting wear saw sources confirming that, felt justified. really, rationalization otherwise actually admit care people -- healthy (read: almost all) majority people know spouting stuff self-proclaimed Christians least need superficially act like empathy. 

I think helped CDC suggested non-sealing masks ineffective representative indicating asymptomatic (different presymptomatic) people less like spreaders. hear things lot push back studies demonstrating effectiveness masks. confirmation bias strong. Thank you! sign-up? kidding imagine Cat5 hurricane slamming Miami Dade county right now? would evac people to? state going accept thousands patients already intubated? tens thousands people shedding Covid? Everybody get popcorn already told friends family stay fuck home welcome shit with. better way prove short-sighted science deniers.... Yeah guess so. think anyone would unless though, I've thought quitting job cause come close contact hundreds people per shift I'm retail. get paid well average county imagine situation similar worse places hiring right now. Bouncer Walmart middle pandemic would near bottom though Employee: *unplugs self checkout machine* everyone US would required wear masks could massively reduce infection rate close 0% within weeks, anyone possibly argue this? never going end country every individual state local government gets decide whether want close reopen, want require masks not. Walmart done help us amid crisis federal government. Engineering often encourages black white thinking belief everything answer.

I‚Äôve noticed computer people too. Technology requires human social,skills tolerance ambiguity. often fundamentalist Christians, another form black white thinking. understand that, what, largest brick mortar retailer world? I‚Äôm sure infrastructure provide masks need it‚Äôs mandatory. It‚Äôs like thought overnight. Waiting Monday lacks urgency decision needs. mask-wearing / social distancing / ‚Äúrecreational‚Äù travel mandate. let knife seen string?

Clinical trials, research studies drug manufacturers need blood plasma recovering COVID-19 patients. hope leads concrete progress finding cure. Thanks sharing. Whats bullshit companies coming decisions, government.

What little faith government gone GOOD close nation-wide mandate going get US lol. seems huge Walmart started rolling hired security week. Tenants lot rights city, right pay rent? really. need direct $$ aid families. hope armed security jobs think whatever want private property. went local walmart once. one person wearing mask. fun begins - Anakin No. focuses social distancing. 

Edit: I‚Äôd also like mention research papers typically focused *one* thing. example, relation working memory adhering social distancing guidelines efficacy following social distancing would two separate research papers.  Give Walmart employees riot gear. Ha! smug, ""I'm wearing mask!"" friend going find another place shop. hope stores enforce mandate, we'll another spike hands, rendering businesses requiring masks useless.

The US fucking embarrassing. Number one new cases every single day, number one total cases, deaths, active cases. wear masks always make political issue cry freedom. Meanwhile, curve flattening everywhere else world, they're smart enough wear masks.

Yes, wear mask. family, company, wife's company needs us remain healthy.

Yeah theres always people renting floor two family people live parents still owning rental properties. 

Now people technology vastly stretches reach terms ability buy properties. People buy places 1000s miles away. addition financing changed significantly favor rental investors regarding single family homes. Essentially wealthy counts lot 20 years ago. 

Also 2011 single-family home prices dropped sharply due recession huge quantities bought large capital funds use rentals essentially amounts land grab.

ADA doesnt second offer form accommodation ( face shields things offer )

the accomodation specific person actually, know, accomodate them. example get someone sensitive skin (thus cant wear face shields) combination breathing issues accomodating them. dont accept offered accommodations still ask leave

No, cant. thats thing. would get sued orbit someone actual disabilities came disabilities made ""accomodations"" insufficient. 


you're simply skirting law moment reason works none people actually disabled. god help one shows up, fuck hilariously thanks last importantly Tribal land

Pretty sure ADA still applies same. excellent info, thank you. Anti masker spotted. backlogs, sounds like incorrect data reports. However, even add negative test results 3,000,000 tests administered Florida, would tiny effect overall positive rate.

Thanks!

;) find disturbing happened. disturbed about, like Huge Covid numbers... I'm already becoming numb this. I've heard before. new outrageous. similar yesterday's stabbing 71 year old man asked wear mask.

When said get used new normal; new normal mind. many though. nowhere, see people countries hating much US does. feel like instead focusing country wrong people hating go talk shit countries. Might something US nr1 choosing country asked ""which country best country world"".  downvoting

I checked history seem differing definitions ""mass downvoting"" think. general response seems mostly ""meh"". (Allthough r/Collapse seem enjoy daily Suecia-delenda-est link-dump.)

If consolation rarely downvote you. find quite gauche reflexively downvote someone disagree disagree you.

ETA: Ironically seems someone downvotes within seconds posting, targeted hire real security workers left deal nutsos? agree more, responding person wanted see people roughed up. problem. Check r/preppers haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs really helpful. can. People conditioned work culture view medical problems ""weakness."" allowed sick days told ""suck up."" nationalized healthcare leads healthy people view health related expenses inconvenience. ""I never go doctor pay insurance taxes people Medicaid, work harder afford themselves!"" essentially, medical problems sign weakness inconvenient.

That's pretty much it. understand lack labor rights access affordable healthcare snowball comes surprise people act like this. likely can‚Äôt reinfect said ""drive through"" realized mention got tests, swab virus blood draw antibodies. assume blood draws drive !? We're going national debate minimum age OK leave kids home alone quite soon. whole bunch arguing, everyone going wind agreeing leaving kids 6 home alone go work incredibly far ideal, going far safest option everyone involved.

I'm seeing way outcome completely inevitable point. 6 young, 6 year old perfectly capable taking meal pre-packaged tupperware fridge putting microwave minute. would far traumatic child young infect kill parent grandparent.  uh, inspire confidence sending kids school 4 weeks. bad Hipocrate take oath American people seriously.

I solemly swear (or affirm) faithfully execute the¬†Office¬†of¬†President United States, best Ability, preserve, protect defend Constitution the¬†United States. almost forgot one. Every day there's new shocking, ""I can't believe read"" headline, difficult keep up.  Conversely, idiots think protect 100%. opposition constantly attacked government's handling coronavirus eager open borders. would effective face shield. early *and* current hotspot back claim data? I‚Äôm open agreeing you, simpleton logic enough convince me. Winning you‚Äôre worried vaccines, could try local health department them. One area come patient‚Äôs car it.

Or could ask put immediately back exam room pediatrician wanted. could've done couple months ago ‚ÄúBut china‚Äù Eh man. Kitchen work hard hell, nothing respect it. 

The influence awful...I see every day. wish someone like 7 figure jobs lol, you‚Äôd keep enough send rest it‚Äôs needed. need folks like that. joke... (I think might part joke) mandatory masks Walmart even started yet. I‚Äôm wondering this.

It doesn‚Äôt say CDC can‚Äôt receive info, HHS will.

Also Covid data collected state health departments, distribute needed (hence Florida hiding data hospitalizations, etc.). data *public health information,* government proprietary info.

And see hospitals, doctors nurses healthcare workers getting injunction bald-faced abuse power. Online/home school. really see viable alternative. No. nothing Constitution delaying election delaying next president get sworn in. US held successful elections Civil War, WWI WII. Also, Constitution makes clear president office specific data conclusion election (Unless, re-elected). Wel century ago UK busy fucking country war concentration camps much time even economy.  still want delay infection long possibly though. Treatment still improving results better chances survive permanent damage vaccine might available finally get infected.

Also, avoid catching near peak, might hospital bed available need it, improving chances. problem people today... never know sometimes Hey, future please use amp links. Let's give Google data power us. mean literally safe environment children anyone forcing children attend, equally viable safer alternative sent prison. Fuck Waltons.

As much asshole underpaid staff shitty, feel like whole Karen thing amounts ""Keep America Beautiful"" style campaign ultimately leads consumer shouldering burden systemic failure corporate cost cutting. Walmart cashier's fault Karen problem, mean problem exists. Hahah omg really type that? Terrible overall. Plenty areas almost one wear them. suspect observance object rural South.  late though  heck? starting see cases linked BLM protests now. surface due course well. country almost everyone guns... Im mask, hate politicians either side say here's problem point anti-masker. misdirection way move blame onto individual.

 coincidence biggest profit healthcare systems world failed contain coronavirus. bottom paragraph literally public health Gestapo lmao  #WWW.OSHA.GOV Go somewhere else then. process legislative body levels charges government official. Impeachment remove official definitively office; similar indictment criminal law, thus essentially statement charges official. buy Fauci crowd fund white house authority? Ohh, thanks! knew I'd done somehow! went Itasca surrounding sticks last weekend get outta city. Zero people north wearing masks. ""vaccine untrusting"" anti-vax. thought I'd offer - carefully chose certain ones &amp; certain versions (for ex. dead polio vs. live) now-adult kid LOT research back 80s, volumes research &amp; consulting various practitioners. social media &amp; heavy marketing blowing stuff wildly black white, much less political?? believe many vaccines useful &amp; valid, believe newer ones pushed pharma profit. believe second pharma FDA primary goal us make us ""healthy"". think irreversible bad results ingredients, sales must go on; follow $. 

So point view, know I'd called? Tell know, still ""anti-vaxxer""? ignore radical anything, know mentality like.

That said, I'm pro-mask. open air far away others, like walking beach, feel necessary. soon gets bit crowded, even outside, put surgical others. Inside really public buildings, like driver's licence place today, used 2 layers - surgical + fabric filter layer.

On plane 2 days, N95 whole way. Based plenty documented spreads, trust anyone's air around us enclosed long. Cosplaytriots?

;) rich get bailed [Florida totally Oh maybe also prominent critics face abuse harassment? part? Yeah gonna go that. Wrote elsewhere c&amp;p examples: 

Some examples follow:

* high profile Swedish academic, Cecilia S√∂derberg Naucler, deleted social media enduring severe abuse.

* Another academic [Lena Einhorn several members ‚Äú22 researchers‚Äù first high profile group criticize Swedish strategy. 

* Another critic, Swedish writer Jewish descent [Elisabeth √Ösbrink called speaking out.

* Sweden‚Äôs [foreign residents frequently abused wearing face coughed on, targeted racial slurs, etc. (Wearing face masks public goes FHM‚Äôs current recommendations many supports FHM see affront.)

* critical Redditors post topic also become targets harassment abuse extent

* go check mentions anyone high profile Twitter who‚Äôs recently criticized Sweden. One recent example harassment targeted journalist Peter Goodman, recently wrote excellent article Swedish situation.

* goes social media platforms: Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, etc. fact Facebook often infiltrate private groups critics, sometimes led creation new, difficult enter groups higher security.

Etc, etc, etc. 


There's civil, adult debate there's abuse pro-Swedish strategy supporters typically engage in. Jewish lady called Hitler says: also became apparent long found problematic: public debates Sweden conducted mature, sensible manner. difficult people deal opinions. married Dane, Sweden Denmark similar many ways. different culture discussion Denmark, probably due liberal influences Germany. buy Fauci crowd fund white house authority?

Got haircut June stylist‚Äôs salon opened 1/2 capacity, temp check, plexus plates etc. Got call week later informing tested positive (no symptoms), got tested negative. Masks work. Repeat me: ""antigen tests antibody tests thing"". may sound vaguely similar antigen tests indicate current infection, similar PCR (though arrive result different methods). include average person US getting fall? Yikes 25 yrs in...I know aren't. going work everyday. (Trust me, know pathetic first sentence is.) What‚Äôs viral transmission speed Zoom days? exactly stupid it? Plenty study participants used I‚Äôd love see Karens knocked . Redditors absolutely seething replies called nonsense. think anyone anywhere public service free, hate break you. surely concerned redditor üòÇ

How country? Could make comparison? mostly agree statement, however read mutation occurred (tench warfare sounds likely birthplace read anything conclusive theory)

One fact tho, letting spread naturally allow mutate. Period. single action keeping door open. making deadlier, perhaps even virulent new mutation underwent. 

Or worse, begins creating severe reactions younger populace.


Also, God knows kind damage/growth occur enough people get second time.  means money fuck you. probably blamed gay people marrying. Sadly worst yet come Expires end month. Apparently white house signaled they'd open extensions limited (no 100% person's prior wage).

We'll see happens statistics infections protests suggest leadership discourage mask use, tell people inject disinfectants. 

Oh whole 88 thing people know means now. Great, virus data go Goon staff. 

Does mean longer trust whatever numbers reported sites like Worldometer? that‚Äôs I‚Äôm taking it. 

I should‚Äôve moved Canada chance. WTF WRONG PEOPLE  US accurate. sure areas. friend. imagine first patient zero patient zero cluster, 8-12 months ago whenever was, try visualise it.

Worst family tree ever. Masks suffocating I'm sick tired incessant bullshit. Corruption running rampant US &amp; nothing close sight returning normality. 2020 fuck hope really do. I‚Äôm afraid need literal nationwide bloody catastrophe anything change. mean lots death. limits *muh freedom* mean yeah, social distancing wearing mask vastly increases chances catching spreading others.

I‚Äôm basing people personally know like family keep throwing get togethers every weekend hotspot, probably won‚Äôt ever stop family gets ill. could tomorrow could next year, based people surround (including young people don‚Äôt social distance) expect they‚Äôll infected infecting others vaccine reliable treatment comes. upvoted actually expressing beliefs time, ANSWERING QUESTION. THANK YOU. 

DOWNVOTING someone disagrees INVITED point view shit going makes America REALLY scary right now. Cancel culture right there. Thank sharing insight point view people saying wanted know about. make sense. approach, Interesting points.

And thanks dick public places require one. poor workers... Like, fuck, dumb people.

I hear endless reports dicknose, pulling masks speak **or cough**. whole fucking point prevent expelling particles may infectious... *and remove __exact__ moment proper fitment critical?*

What fucking fickity fuck. Fuck thats amazing idea 67 testing negative, that's 40% sample size 104 interviewed showed symptoms.  That's pretty large sample size definitely helps evidence effective masks bonkers.

what wrong people sad part Walmart Canada already giving hazard pay months. Walmart US thrown us couple bonuses months apart. even $300 full timers, weak $150 part timers. Guess company hires most? told children can't get can't carry it. need open schools. lied to?  still unable understand mentality person behaves like child throwing tantrum simply piece fabric face. Put mask on, shopping, shut mouth, leave people alone, go home. totally boggles mind, point complete utter bewilderment. adds even confusing situation people somehow attributing decision wearing mask political view. That's understand many ""mask wearing"" articles posted politics subreddit. piece fabric wear face nothing politics. He's trying make name himself. months ago released statement acting like virus going devastating state governor taking seriously, he's changing sides contrarian. know arguing topic. Yes definitely state governments, (or slowly), large corporations definitely help get economy going well. help that? one biggest stores America require masks, large percentage people like wearing mask (anecdotal, source back last part up).

They need reopen safely, open without additional requirements (example: Texas Florida) statistics infections protests suggest leadership discourage mask use, tell people inject disinfectants. fuck wrong people? One renowned persons field whole world trying discredit him... missing words this....  They've got billion stock market isn‚Äôt real life Holy fuck subreddit sad... like BIG YIKES material  schools.  bad I'm hoping it? much husband still world, kids contributed spread would sort settle nerves know came fine. still really scary would nice little bit peace.

Dude ur reason people don‚Äôt take us seriously. u arguing me? said article zero substance wasn‚Äôt backed creditable evidence. didn‚Äôt say disagreed opinion. evidence literally cited opinionated journalism articles. That‚Äôs horrible journalism practices. Godspeed. take know anything India? 

Social distancing practically impossible here. India never chance containing virus imo. first two failed. Let's hope 3rd time charm. ONE demographic REALLY wont like this.. people shop walmart.  wife other's COVID therapy dogs.

We enjoy good scratch behind ear well. Keep mind parent tested positive takes days get result. Meaning positive even test taken. Meaning kid likely contracted thus spreading kids days. suggest start supplement basic immune supporting vitamins vitamin C, vitamin zinc hope best expires last week month. except one state (I forgot which) technically apply last week supposed expire (July 31st) payouts slightly before/after. think heard July 25/26th final week mostly. Yes, showing rude. Stay states. impacted Costco‚Äôs positively n=1, one places I‚Äôve shopped since March, mask requirement. know I‚Äôm alone good point think need help, friend.

Besides that, care people still logically understand point mask mandates. mask wearing important community health. people without mandate. care get that. We're hoping update you!

Also, see article listed front page even main page Health section. buried. America? SOL.

Diplomacy. assume like trade. local Walmart sign requiring face coverings (state order). 0% enforced. blame associates all. point people literally shot telling customers wear mask leave. put life line Walmart. get bouncers may work club closed.

Also mean offense almost every Walmart door greeter I've seen seemed special needs/mentally challenged person. ""it takes away 75% oxygen personal freedoms"" dad's birthday November Netherlands chance? girlfriend works Walmart. already fun. gonna absolute shit show. surreal mean absolute bullshit, yes, yes is.  guy worried managing narrative removes transparency around spread virus idiotic policies allowed spread virtually unchecked across nation.  

If ever time needed Congress Senate jobs bring sanity back process, it. fuck happening now? real life?  America used country anyone could come nothing make something themselves.

But today feels like place everyone believes they‚Äôre victim 24/7 everything owed even slightest inconvenience conspiracy. Please use 'Velcro' generic term.  

Instead, say ""hook loop"".  Right it‚Äôs different already present risk life driving road asshat driving bmw sudden jumping lane.

Look, wear mask, I‚Äôm pro choice wanting wear mask not. also okay risk could potentially get sick even smaller odds could die. It‚Äôs time accept risk, know it‚Äôs there, get back life. We‚Äôve literally everything else years. ???? school district? Wasn‚Äôt way parkway? masks, implemented 7 months virus started spreading dont qualify.

THe meASUrE laTE LEgitiMate saw dude get mad refuse wear mask walk straight produce breathing shut. Picking shit putting back etc. common sense That's silly. Center Disease Control involved controlling spread disease??? /s  US? People Alabama follow people lack knowledge Didn‚Äôt mean refer subreddits. 

I sang SBC‚Äôs prank 3%ers concert. Dr. Fauci, gonna do... always tough bargain us Canadians... Move money shorter life expectancy. they're afraid enforce it. nothing change. put mask, ugly anyway. ""Walmart Bouncer"" strangest Covid job I've heard date.

Big portion press conference spent explaining order enforced. !remindme 6 months us normal walmart shoppers shame unmasked.  work there, cannot fired get joy telling Karens. else me? may actually go shopping retailers this. personally shop Walmart.

Is database national retailers announced masks mandatory? governor who, two months ago, [asked Trump declare pandemic act God shield oil collapsed demand surging supply. Fox News still largely working home?

""It's totally safe outside guys"" says man bunker. Direct link article thing worth reading. Judging comments many read. 67 tested negative, 72 refused testing, 139 confirmed symptoms. mask symptoms quarantine get tested. We're life death struggle civilization know it, bitching God forbid someone publish science. bothered read article would seen even go far make policy recommendations terms dealing working memory deficiency. first month. Maybe even first 2. now, unemployment running out, hope returning work hope money. new jobs, places downsizing. Sooooo, idk, August/September/maybe October able keep home family..... exciting Someone downvoted guy asking source. got fam. Ain't nothing wrong wanting source, people. OP said read articles/reports too. go drive truck dirt roads mountains stay away everyone, ya ignorant hillbilly. better believe Faucy stops censoring starts speaking truth, virus president's response, every major network begin ""Fox"" ""Joe Rogan""will 24 hr loop. number representative population? so, would immunity possible children?

I seriously doubt accurate representation given many adults would it, I‚Äôm curious means Floridaman stoop low use gun weapon. Floridaman would throw snapping turtles tape bags frozen peas fists. local walmart people seemed already wearing masks, it'll nice longer see handful morons strutting without them. maybe they'll actually kick jackasses wear mask they're front doors, take shop. smh

Hopefully make sure employees actually wear masks too, vendor walking backroom nightmare 10+ employees running around masks talking one another close quarters. mean, sorry im native? Also mean gatjering facemask distancr dumb. Imo, saw protest distancing mask thats good. going interesting seeing people react traditionally conservative-leaning companies telling wear masks. Companies cater customer feelings long they're making money, soon real world comes-a-knocking profits they'll tell customers fuck feelings. 

And there's ambiguity: covid19 absolutely affect profits employees start coming large numbers. would like employees started unionize, except force nature making show work. many companies hire anti-union consultants. Walmart egregious like many 2000, Walmart closed 180 meat counters retail locations switched prepackaged cuts butchers Texas location voted join United Food Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). 2005, year Walmart employees voted unionize Canadian store, senior management closed location entirely. already like Texas, forgot many states require masks public spaces. What? Making employees wear masks easy. leverage it. want wear mask work? Cool, fuck off, Walmart largest employer nation outside government. hard replace minimum wage retail worker. YouTube going collapse sheer volume meltdown videos. becoming rule? shit going like 4 months, countries already come starting lay rules places wtfff. How. Was. This. Not. Already. The. Policy? NBC news last night conspiracy theory quote CDC. Jesus. new records. Outside deaths, really wonder Covid-19 change life long term. *Will give give*

*The lungs martyrs*

My friend exposed &amp; I‚Äôve hanging days off, day.

How far line level exposure go? tests positive, friend would quarantine mean quarantine too?

Edit: Thanks everyone responses. friend going quarantine. Kay dude? Thanks super insightful comment. RI well right now, though admit it‚Äôs perfect. 

Point is, places starting open back whether like not. per employer unless positive test, symptoms, I‚Äôm coming work. 

I wear mask. rigorous cleaning makes feel safer grocery store. 

But complex issue, black/white. I'd say ""may be"" gross understatement. live Northern Arizona people Freaking Out. determine states applying quarantine rules on. Consider living city, like do. affordable option college (in state tuition) ended costing much. I'm dog groomer, pay around 900-1000 every two weeks. phone bill 100 finally paying phone itself, electric 280, gas 50, internet 60 (grandfathered plan) health insurance 300, car insurance 180 (no accidents, pay mile) life insurance 30, renters insurance 100(thanks lemonade) diapers baby essentials 100-150, student loan payments 300 month. rent extraordinarily low 895 month 3 bedrom apartment. 2500 month. Notice food hasnt mentioned once.  Mom licensed beautician, used make hair funeral homes well. hardly gone barber shops much decided learn myself. Lately, hot I've got short. bet gets blamed Obama still wake sometimes, Clarice? wake dark hear screaming Karens.... think Covid ends, wake dark ever awful screaming Karens. am√©rica, M√©xico Walmart Made mandatory 2 months ago. think they'll apply pressure individual managers compliance this? believe issued statewide mask mandate. little late guys. I'd say strong possibility. spring semesters start end January, enough doses produced vaccinate large portion US. Even enough students, would tamp spread significantly. Combined better treatments, question like going Chernobyl photo op. I'm mostly concerned fact every time open netflix ""Designated Survivor"" trending right now. Tom ""Just 2 weeks we'll herd immunity"" Britton  pop's bday tomorrow? cusp 58? Jokes aside. feel family. truly sucks asking cousin wear mask SAVE LIVES difficult task. refuses because... what, again? deepstate conspiracy? what? Make people wear masks? big mask corporate lobby looking sell masks? 100% turned away door. NJ employees cases police officers outside major supermarkets, letting customers one time, masks. Elementary teacher disadvantaged school southern state. absolutely correct. unfortunately, what's driven race bottom one-two punch deliberate underfunding (thank ass-backwards methodology funding schools property taxes, *deeply* racist history) pretending like situation magically resolved whatever new test standards Pearson HMH ETS pushing decade.

All nowadays test kids, gather data, teach better next test. actually *learning* anything learn *why* like richer, whiter kids do. learn *why* something works, learn *to it*, turns school nothing boring, rote memorization. incredibly dangerous, American culture 2020 nothing cacophony distractions designed pull poor kids track success never let back on. always outliers. But, looking back history morbidity curves infected ratios pandemics like Spanish Flu. provide least guidance cities reacted respect various ""waves"". First, first outbreak Spanish Flu spring 1918 - call 1st wave want. second wave, one every talks occurred fall 1918. third wave occurred spring 1919 small outbreak spring 1920 sometimes labeled fourth wave (which ironically, killed 2 great-grandparents). vaccine infected 28% US population maybe 1/3 entire world population - nearly close herd immunity sort vanished.

Anyway, look attached link second ""wave"" see outbreaks impacted different paywalled sense provide email get free account.

Most hardest hit cities fall 1918, nearly impacted outbreaks spring 1919, cities ""spared"" 2nd wave (though still better overall Philadelphia) impacted 3rd wave spring 1919. also outliers example San Francisco - impacted heavily fall spring (which could attributed Anti-Mask league). Nothing virus ever going neatly fit one category. 

If want think way.

Think virus outbreaks forest fires vulnerable people (e.g. covid elderly) kindling. forest fire hits area shoots embers hit areas. ember hits spot already burned (i.e. vulnerable people dead protected) can't start another fire kindling ignite (it might spark little i.e. infect small groups can't start new big forest fire). But, hits spot still kindling (lots uninfected people) ignite start another fire somewhere else (virus break out). one ways forest fires fought creating breaklines lighting small controlled burns eliminate said kindling. 

I'm sure people disagree example analysis talk reinfections, mutations, herd immunity like. fine most, virus pandemics historically worked way. I'm sure people say time different. But, is, sense social media majority Reddit never lived real pandemic. Flu outbreaks 50s 60s killed millions right population much lower back then.

I also look states regions. NYC, LA, Houston, etc. much better cities like Buffalo, SF El Paso. words, head fall outbreaks, cities massive surges virus.

Don't get wrong, would better deal back January/February right almost assuredly heading. ""Contents program may factual""

But seriously, people jail this. can't claim ignorance point. Walmart hire bouncers work enforce mask policies. Remember you‚Äôre heroes. You‚Äôre martyred will. first quote. people watching bothers him, way messes self worth. thought sought many there's 2. Diminishes self worth values based others see him. Hell people bound think us therefore resides them. That's less sartre meant say real. manager know company pays H1-B versus US citizens, top company pays immigration relocation costs. sometimes means paying entire family move India, putting months temporary housing, get one medium-level engineer pay rate local talent.

If could fill ranks Americans there's doubt would. Corporations exist make money.

If kill pipeline skilled individuals, Trump trying do, tech companies going lower hiring bar scoop less qualified American citizens. Every major tech company already offices around world. can't consolidate teams US, consolidate somewhere else. Man many jokes I'd get banned sub instantly lol really hate keep saying it, we're probably gonna get physical selfish demographic listen language one know. Get one zappy batons Combine Half Life. Nice That's fucking genius particular person working WHO, might lead tendency distrust organisation. Also, vaccine sceptical specific sense sceptical HPV/flu vaccines, vaccines general.
For mask attitudes, initial flow studies quite overwhelming, people interpreting studies far actually stating. Especially official international bodies taking counter stance. think people quite keen jumping conclusions demonizing counter view quickly, without really quantifying viewpoint. hindsight, given information easy condemn opposing group, we've also seen quick reactions conclusion jumping negative impact (like statements ibuprofen hydroxychloroquine). But.... but, m'uh Freedum‚Ñ¢! Watching every motion foolish lover's game entered consolation drawing spend 2 weeks ICU death bed. I‚Äôve read columns sides basically saying ‚ÄúI hope get rid Trump normal right vs left debates again.‚Äù Wal-Mart train employees remind customers right shop elsewhere. problem neoliberalism. \*truly\* asinine focus individual poor person tell bootstrap way poverty instead focusing addressing systems cause poverty first place. way think poor poor people country completely backward serves blame obfuscate systemic perpetrators income inequality poverty. I'm truly sorry u/Jwinner5, situation fault feel like lay income v. expenses justify it. American economy literally set like pyramid scheme that's fault. Yes, yell ridiculous plaguerats wearing masks can't follow store anymore! exactly it. would bet amount money extremely calculated decision done Ivy League grads working top

Frankly, don‚Äôt expect order enforced whatsoever. Everyone talking crazy going be, chance hell defiant customer physically removed store allowed enter. massive liability own. It‚Äôs reason associates aren‚Äôt allowed physically stop shoplifters. most, particular store manager feels inclined, might deny customer ability check out. I‚Äôm sure many won‚Äôt give shit, though. 


This lip service done Wal Mart better legal situation they‚Äôre inevitably sued wrongful deaths caused COVID. ‚ÄúWell, tried everything could, even asked customers mask up! literally couldn‚Äôt anymore without shutting down.‚Äù

I expect practically nothing change. black white. isn‚Äôt current climate. 

But yes, I‚Äôm, personally, totally enough. Cheers, mate. Done engaging. going see many confederate flag masks. guarantee I've seen 6 different states Walmarts. Watch mark people down.

I provided details. Take leave it. you. I'm shocked never Wal-Mart. American? Everyone saw went wearing mask matter what. like, can't support ceo supports guy wants to: deport massive portion Goya customers, has: put hell made boogeyman entirety tenure president, openly campaigning sheer animosity feels families. man wants end daca, man who's agency separated children parents, man determined build giant symbol bigotry he'd rather use billions tax payer money rather it.

It stops politics go family, call criminals rapists, use power highest seat government try remove home. takes one infected person within 13 feet 30 seconds wearing mask infect you. party big. They've confirmed casually breathed out. attended person meeting, understanding, without mask. confirmed positive meeting. (Edit: waiting results meeting, clear)

Another thread picture taken Redditor Walmart Sunday. Also without mask. 

I think safe assume care Oklahoma. terrible/no Federal response state done different things different times. example Ohio big lock early response. opened early populated cities seeing rise. Florida much slow weeks, maybe. US place dealing it. 

It's fucking stupid serious response could reopening real instead bullshit we're now. sure data analyst making 15 dollars hour gives rat's ass either way  dismissal 300 small number shows lack comprehension. one kids likely contagious period time prior testing positive, participating practices etc. odds significantly kids already infected zero. this, /r/sharktank ? Sometime call GOP. live Texas feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills. friends might think turned liberal. That's worse outcome contracting virus. Don‚Äôt forget also much less healthy population New York really bad medical system outside larger cities. Like astronomically bad. would rather treated high end vet ERs Alabama. That‚Äôs joke grew Alabama. Never thought would see day Walmart hire bouncers. Jokes Google. ask even fucked questions friends. also sorry see want eradication tribal entities

im sorry think laws meant protect disabled people dont apply you. 

all brain cells reasonable might well get rid you. arent Casino policy

it may surprise know ""other people too"" make something non-tribal ones shut down.

Because got lucky havent accidentally fucked actual disabled person. reason. Missouri number 3, less 5 days first. F oh tell, field

Maybe it‚Äôs American corporate law, corporation give notice mandatory working conditions. Like it‚Äôs requirement stop wearing jeans casual Friday‚Äôs, notice given Friday... usually business hours. Yeah, sure, wish. I'm never voting Biden. know everyone Illinois talks bad looking around feel pretty safe. Compared. That‚Äôs local store. It‚Äôs working part. Send past blue ridge please We're knee deep pandemic, economic ""advisors"" getting op-eds trash doctor administration want speak American public.

That‚Äôs pretty fast operations implementation.  want widespread. I‚Äôm Christian think it‚Äôs crazy people don‚Äôt think spreading love Christ means wearing mask protect fellow neighbors. think ‚Äúwe need come together worship like God would want us to‚Äù do? Please enlighten could possible worse? Well, there's that. people plain stupid. Wonderful idea /s really makes sense, thanks great explanation. bought clippers using #8 sides back every 2 weeks letting top grow. comb, hairdryer little (I emphasize LITTLE) hair gel/paste, look bad, fact think like enough keep style pandemic (well... pandemic ever over... ) that's.... horrific. scary heck. Really hope send CDC along idiot house choke safe word

Can rethink protocols here? Trump give billions churches, Dr. Phil Kanye? Swede here, get whole obsession masks everyone somehow turned right/left thing. goverment left leaning standards encourage masks all, barely one wears one here. also one higest death toll per milion there's that.. Bukowski disdain humans, that's saying quote above.

You responded sartre quote nothing this. dont know much clearer get. Good. like it? shop there. free country free shop somewhere else. powerful going ‚Äúterrible twos‚Äù myself. videos generate going entertaining. Karen going try call police Manager Walmart store. keep subscribing shit ideas electing shit politicians, sure. 


Y'know, places get ELECT manage lives. Texass fucking over, well, there's probably pithy dumbass faux-'country' maxim that, I'll leave fish outhouse. points numbers:
- reporting voluntary, actual case count likely higher
- 400,000 students participate high school sports, small fraction summer workouts. article doesn‚Äôt say many. 

Impossible draw statistical conclusions article. That's like 1 every 80 students. 5 classes day means every person school would probably share room positive case point day. One hope yes i've seen people say wear home made face coverings majority Americans would like now. respectfully disagree. long borders shut majority US travellers, contained dumpster fire. wish they'd start macing tazing asses starve idiots, coming Monday. surprising all. Stats since beginning shown virus disproportionately affect impoverished communities, generally unhealthy overweight. mention, live tiny households house multiple generations, namely older generations.

Lockdowns, ironically, also disproportionately negatively affects impoverished communities ones keep going working, transmitting virus back households.

This class issue, one mainstream media governments refuse address instead shamelessly pander tiny twitter mobs reddit users want engage pointing fingers maskers/non-maskers, anti/pro lockdowners, etc. Worse, totally pander corporate elites transferring mass wealth items like CARES Act. Gotcha, sure came from. would surprised Walmart offered complimentary masks. Yep hear 3 months later started human trials! normally near ball-gags. basically every day work i'm connecticut people actually wear masks still often stressful. parts country would need way money willing take bullshit. sure glad Doctor economist.... want answer someone concern, say quarantine. want answer someone less concerned, say wear mask, socially distance wash hands use sanitizer.

Edit: use common sense practices keep everyone around safe think exposed. said, there's good chance exposed. M-o-o-n spells moron. Angry karen everywhere know fucked mom, right? Hopefully fact many people rely Walmart means finally put mask here, feel like news come fruition, saw nothing dexamethasone that's one that's proven People love hate Donny. Can't wait til wins... ""DoNaLd tRuMp cOroNAviRuS.."" 

I always knew Amercians less IQ u look manipulation media done masses hilarjous. guy done EVERYTHING asked except wear mask make ppl panic.... masks, ventilators, tests, naval ships, ban travel, etc...... yall want? BACK BUSINESS!!! cases go up, death rate goes where? GOES DOWN!!!! Americans going starve! problem big delays test results hard enough stay home work two weeks even it, real hardship. know? cut hair. It‚Äôs really bad. $40 set clippers good scissors hand held mirror practice. won‚Äôt go hairdresser again. DC they're completely backed now. tests taken two mondays ago took 3 days, almost nothing rest week sent yet. got friend who's 19 days office informed there's longer wait yet. completely fucking useless. actually believe anti-maskers ""right wing nut jobs"" scared black people? Oh, jesus. already? fuck right away? not? dunno. live southern Florida.  Masks mandated quite counties. Walmarts too.  seen single freakout. know man, every day read US wants open borders I'm worried happen. wish another continent would probably feel safe.

Hopefully continue feeling good live here. remindme thing again? going piss Walmart's base. state mandated masks months ago, really much change me. 

Are saying people going wallmart shop without masks??? fuck? understand remark. No, world envision. would envision least basic leadership, concern competence part federal administration facilitates resource information sharing localities/states, gives direction citizens mitigate risks, enables quick response hot spots, prioritizes accelerates research treatment prevention, looks ways help ease unemployment training programs business incentives, leverages international relationships across dimensions help constituents. 

But this. leadership gaslighting people, trying believe big deal. people taking lead that.

Thus hope awareness stories like might help. must hard get life dumb. Oh good maybe local walmart enforce it, ah probably since enforce already statewide mandate thats placeüôÑüò° I'm thankful. went shopping recently least 50 perfect wearing masks. It‚Äôs risk sure. Fortunately, fit enough bouncer probably means fit enough survive case coronavirus. 

Let‚Äôs hope Walmart medically screening ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù daily continuing pay get infected. till date safety maintaining? 

My brother mail carrier. working even hours pandemic started. daughter home immune system compromised. fear brother going bring home one day number people interacts daily basis. 

Where going go?? remindme 4 days! Nah that‚Äôs gonna happen know it. 

All houses bought banks sold roughly amount bought for. businesses property. 

The rich always get richer. Oooooo Karen ain‚Äôt going like this. least wait tuesday Well uh, yeah am. referring music video.  

I can't remember ever hearing ""hook loop"" Corps. Facebook? Don‚Äôt read Facebook mate. doesn‚Äôt represent average opinion. That's stores have, bouncers work. Except Wal-Mart (Canada), greeter. 

But also mandatory mask requirement outside dense cities. LOL can‚Äôt wait hear MIL‚Äôs reaction

Her last thoughts mask wearing, ‚ÄúI wear mask 13 hours day work. I‚Äôm wearing mask outside it.‚Äù 

Fuck them, could ages ago. thought Walmart already requires masks gooooooo AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHA fuck guy. testing facilities reporting 98-100% positivity rate, indicates they're reporting negative tests, positive ones. fix things report negative tests well, number tests go positivity rate go down.

From hear, small number small testing labs, probably going add huge numbers tests start reporting negative numbers, might move positivity rate 1% lower something, best. lol told flu coronavirus?

I love people prove front know absolutely nothing subject they're talking about. best part posted thinking comment would make look like intelligent, freethinking skeptic. lmao good ol' right wing disinformation must super dumb New Zealand lol remember US 300k sheesh Fuck off. fair, ""let run course"" common response epidemics human history. proactive disease relatively new thing. last sentence floored throughout crisis. leadership hint competence could started working months ago. duty disclose that. Moreover, fits pattern political bias.

Yeah conclusions study something everybody agrees now!

This study - prevalence point estimates imply 54,000 (95CI 25,000 91,000 using weighted prevalence; 23,000 95CI 14,000-35,000 using unweighted prevalence) people infected Santa Clara County early April, many approximately 1,000 confirmed cases time survey. Conclusions estimated population prevalence SARS-CoV-2 antibodies Santa Clara County implies infection may much widespread indicated number confirmed cases. 

There nothing would contentious democratic source said now.

It would look like show tens thousands people infected Covid reported Santa Clara!

Nobody would issue said today.

But Ioannidis said back April, implied things werent deadly reported, ""hit"" dig way discredit saying.

Like digging around investors see could pin kind ""Conflict Interest"" rap study.

But end result .. agree Ioannidis study saying. ""There many infections thought, death rate much lower initially reported"". fucked... I'm surprised try hide it, many Oklahoma's health departments outspoken Covid treated, likely would leaked anyways rushing tests through. Thats good finally hear hell going enforce see easily 8 10 people walk store without mask given time. 

They man power stop let alone asshole says proceeds pull weapon use it.

Sad going see employees injured killed beyond deaths virus. Everything political nowadays... Shucky ducky Overtime costs....for Walmart employees lol. mean guess pay much food stamps. Sorry, I‚Äôm buying it, America. cannot expect someone making minimum wage go people tell put mask. Employees killed (literally) this.

And that‚Äôs including people keeping masks nose, neck, etc.

I zero faith expectation employees enforce it, Americans follow it. video China, show everyone plays role containing virus. restaurant workers taxi drivers. wonder media never ever discussed China done contain covid 19 besides welding doors shot conspiracy? thing btw. specific area wanted one entrance building could keep track people entering leaving. haven‚Äôt touched another human months. 
I‚Äôm eating trash like raccoon don‚Äôt go grocery store.

Fuck yeah, finally. ""The thermostat set .1 degrees high/low!!

They blocked bunch single Arab Asian men entering mall. walked white guy speaking English asked what's going on. told broken English deal was, let get dinner anyway. Karenhiet Thermometer high Okay must also advocate safe abortions timely manner right? 

Why wearing mask choice middle pandemic? absolutely mandated upon everyone 1) prevent citizens dying, 2) letting disease become endemic. 

Jesus Walmart officially ***DANGER ZONE*** mask better mask, masks ways wearing masks significantly better others, everyone realizes that. people wear masks loosely give fuck, people literally understand that's less effective. Millions Karens crying rn Facebook. Yes. depressing. dont know still me. deep depression right too. wanted dishes changed mind... ‚òπ  wise see socialist v. capitalist Cold War binary? 

This difference moral yet functional pragmatism, ideologically rigidity. Western Europe pragmatically taken much best *both* private public sectors. Western Europe socialist. Though clearly comparison much center-left, also clearly free market multiple areas. Europeans general far less reflexively selfishly individualistic much America. *depressing insider's perspective, feels like absolute insanity.

I hate heartless since seem care actual child's life, someone point going powerful ad use next election. went walmart rural Ohio day wearing mask. greeters standing outside sign saying masks recommended, clear lot people following it. guy front wife wearing one, walked one greeter, probably 75-80 year old man thanked wearing one. could tell actually meant something simply wearing mask. 

I feel bad employees situation they're put in. need serious security actually enforce this. can't expect old greeters able enforce this, they'd putting risk catching virus. called nasal swabs. tests generate false negatives, nasal swabs risk higher amount virus airway low, see  always act live may contagious regardless test result says. much comfortable. Take care! kids miss vaccine, still get later? could done ""one nation"" back March completely control. union weak leaders weaker. pandemic going downfall US historians look back. Saw dude Download last year dreads knees. Life goals... sucks living alone. safe reckless member household. Lmao edgy type behind keyboard üòÇ. real answer education mislead politicians media. Americans dumb can't figure somewhat responsible without attacking group. Earlier week went Costco encountered THREE groups 3-5 people, maskless, back store workers usually back slapping rebellious ""patriotic."" nauseating. 

To enforce this, stores need lot hired eyes around make work. live think it‚Äôs insanity üò© talking about? never said that, read comment again. Yeah, think he's cautiously optimistic efficacy vaccine. think better CD8+ Cell response would've great, actually know sure Cell response seems match immune profiles people recovered covid-19, there's really nothing discouraging here.

It's probably worth expecting first generation vaccines going perfect. they're something take yearly 4 5 years wait someone perfect vaccine lasts 20 years, that's hardly big deal. town idiot town wife much endangered group due pre existing conditions 

To extent talking we'd completely self isolate wife situation.

The dude went market, wife, made scene cheese stand SERVED FIRST wife endangered there. Caused massive scene.

Walmart always restriction lol know would cite confirmed cases, knowing know huge amounts uncounted asymptomatic cases, unless trying make coronavirus seem deadlier really is. Use IFR.

Making good case kevin male version Karen. fair take 15 days get results point testing frequently...  Belgium used top list deaths, including suspected ones, counted.

I've seen movies. know ""scientists"" are. /s Seriously?? I‚Äôm Philly area I‚Äôd estimate mask usage inside grocery stores around 95% ... Everyone. Doctors, medical professionals, scientists. already witnessed. broadway actor died last week.

Reality either. make reality every day lives. Legal liability hell drug. considered proactive? Little late like reactive. I'll shocked actually enforce this. publicly claim want, know charge local level. inevitably cause tremendous loss income them, anyway. So, way go exactly planned. Sadly... Hey bud, wanted say link provided company, ""Lumia Health"", I'm fairly sure running scam. Twitter Facebook accounts (Lumia Health) created April single person LinkedIn lists company employer. Maybe reuse mask. Thank god, want ostracized. actually train people protocol handle assholes say ""no?""

It seems like every time hear shit, always happens Wal-Mart.

All rules world dont mean shit protocol isnt implemented handle stupid customers. Walmart, shopping center science-denying, mouthbreathing, ignorant, *Duck Dynasty* wives reject dirty pink pajamas camouflage jackets.  e-mail local health department, city council, mayor, local news mean.

I believe must choose one. seems different agencies different statistics reported, going one central module total statistics give clear picture entire data within US.

As understand data consumed centrally even it‚Äôs reported different ways. It‚Äôd like option upload time sheet, email submit manager. Issues could arise methods kept date other. Agency 1 1/3 total numbers Agency 2 2/3 numbers overlap two agencies.

I‚Äôd think it‚Äôs likely certain data points would missing overall numbers different. Like they‚Äôd report new cases subset hospitals won‚Äôt break age patients break differently. Things like that. level care improved data?

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much help patients. provided two cherry picked examples nations leadership dramatically failed response ignoring Northern European nations well.

Basically you‚Äôre trying provide biased flawed data try prove point.

Great job. Pubs can‚Äôt wait Maybe there's better way get message them. approach mean ineffective. No. racists.

Convenient line though. fair bit canada too, saying masks covid BLM next steps gov control you...somehow.

I want see Palpatines behind everything theory next lol ""how many died?""

In 50 years time (if successive fascists taken complete control everything time), historians talk endlessly stupid globally one worst pandemics modern history. thought B.S. BS. may depend are.

Walmart require chinstraps come Monday. half people bother wear facemask wear chinstrap anyway. local store, small town, general merchandise doors closed, funneling everyone grocery side, there's giant banner stating masks required (state local government order due spike cases least 2 confirmed cases within 5 minutes store).

As walked go pharmacy yesterday, counted 4 employees masks around chins, 4 covering nose, least 2 customers walked right mask.

I thought speaking manager walked remembered worked Walmart years ago. Either manager blow smoke ass they'll take care absolutely nothing they'll go give half assed warning employees, they're supposed manager sight go back fucking off. Walmart greeter: ""Welcome Walmart, ma'am please wear mask""

Choices, choices.... Yes, know amateur research sugar causes inflammation - basically, distracts immune system. time COVID-19, distraction bad!! Keep sugar (especially added sugar, fruit problem) low nutrition high. seriously can't hurt - help! People keep electing criminals posts live it. ridiculous minority population decide lives majority majority care participate democratic process. 

You blame government system much want, 40% population vote elections, minority 31% decide lives, longer sit complain fault government. Must satire estimated mean duration onset symptoms death 17¬∑8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16¬∑9‚Äì19¬∑2) hospital discharge 24¬∑7 days days seems reasonable, probably miss many bit arbitrary may miss tiny outliers.

Fuck you, worthless ass mods. [Global posted update  anti-mask father lives Walmart. almost want call him, ask it, record freak lol. Grow told much learning harmful;

Wtf, people really tell kids? political chess match that's going using people's lives pawns disgusting. Wear damn mask, socially distance, stay home much can.  Can‚Äôt wait videos LOONIES losing it. called information filtering...

Example: forgot mention Canada took care people land US 9/11, majority Americans going back home... (but maybe think fake news...)

""The highjackers came Canada"", God, man, listen yourself... link study article. pull many many .2 seconds lazy fuck. 
At time article know covid lungs fat embalment know asymptomatics bad lungs ""probably recover"" fully lipids lung tissue. dont even get making people wear masks could impact business meaningful way. think (hope?) also partly disinformation campaigns foreign forces. double even collapse retarded neutron star stupidity. Sigh

I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm actively following progress two dozen vaccines work happen little experience forecasting drug approvals sales. won‚Äôt vaccine available public end year despite happy headlines vaccine progress. Drug development usually takes longer even experts‚Äô predictions, throw laymen projections timelines directly garbage. MERS didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdry up,‚Äù it‚Äôs still threat Middle East camels serve resivoir, that‚Äôs oxford working vaccine... still doesn‚Äôt exist despite disease substantially deadly SARS C-19... also don‚Äôt SARS vaccine 12 years later... don‚Äôt need master‚Äôs biology understand implications respect C-19 vaccine. 

Like repeat ad nauseam, people ignore news isn‚Äôt phase III data. Phase III real first step towards understanding vaccine useful not, often discover substantially reduced efficacy rare substantial adverse effects didn‚Äôt show smaller phase I/II trials. Worst ‚Äúvaccine induced enhancement‚Äù saw SARS vaccine decade ago. fact matter won‚Äôt really understand useful vaccine it‚Äôs approved administered tens thousands patients millions patients. herd immunity need least 60-70% efficacy nearly 100% uptake population is... basically impossible day age. 

So vaccine, including oxford vaccine, ready end year even get candidate approved (and could write essay it‚Äôs usually great idea mass produce distribute first vaccine that‚Äôs developed) there‚Äôs guarantee protect virus even protects virus may create herd immunity conditions unless it‚Äôs *very effective* protecting virus. That‚Äôs lot unlikely targets hit vaccine save us COVID hell. still wonder, good reason, long protection last. That‚Äôs many experienced well-respected epidemiologists immunologists candidly admitted various forums vaccine unlikely solution problem‚Äî effective clinical treatments like Remdesivir nanobodies antiviral treatments studied going key ending pandemic. course, still don‚Äôt even adequate testing nearly half year later. 


So ‚Äúno‚Äù friendly wager? Mask wearing American here. Same. Anyone wear mask selfish hell spawn. certainly act like that. 

Then literally seen covid human body. Welcome Trump's America, points made facts matter. agree. way short sighted this. March started blowing shut school businesses. peaking way higher March, want us wear mask two weeks send kids back school like everything fine. Solid plan. Oh Blackburn amirite? I've heard council announced restrictions spike cases want avoid second lockdown Boomers people Nah need like 7ft lift truck one hand jacked ""Okay, natural selection! dumb ones dead, survivors little bit smarter!"" - Gordon Freeman LMFAO money sitting foundation. spent, fact making money. Tax free. INVEST INVEST way stop continuing?

Yes.

The old people driving die coronavirus.

Then stop. ‚ÄúWhatcha readin‚Äô fer?‚Äù think backlogs make huge difference. Even significant spike like that.
The problem big numbers, florida big numbers, need look trend. Statistically daily backlogs cancel other. Older tests counted new ones added backlog. Also spike like affect trend much look 7 day average still 10k cases day. 

As trends small numbers... totally different story. outside store in, assholes take they‚Äôre past entrance. fucking kidding happens online schooling? kids kill grandmas get mysterious Kawasaki disease symptoms? 'Increasing evidence'? Yes, doctors worn masks surgery fucking century ""might slow spread infection"". Nobody done research proven time, though. doctors done anyway, know, *just case*.

Seriously, somebody putting liquid stupid drinking water supply? level pure idiocy jaw-dropping. Yet casinos closed. course blaze still raging cut fuel fire needs. Close casinos stop major disease vector. could cut virus knees, want to. grocery store town sign months saying customers must wear mask enter. gone store handful times since March, never enforced. last time went in, customer wearing mask.

My dad asked help find something sporting goods store month ago woman husband walked store immediately took mask ""nobody else wearing one"". Except, like, everybody seen store wearing one.

On 4th July, parents cookout like every year. hate heat hate crowds, stayed inside day like every year. Everybody sitting really close other, nobody wore mask, literally everybody came inside use bathroom made comment antisocial.

I've stopped checking facebook whole feed filled people spewing garbage masks bad can't forced wear mask.

And home, listen mom talk right wear one.

Life great right now. little late? Yeah taxpayers pay cops protect corporations, they'll fine. thing Georgia hear. Makes really worried mom teacher. Sadly higher risk people would wary first ones. health already bad. fear issues completely unknown real. 3 autoimmune diseases honestly concerned time tested likely still get it. #GOOD took 4 months also 5 foot tall?

So many Idaho rednecks gonna pissssssed oh hooray. I‚Äôm happy right now. started, people taking serious. seems like less less people caring, getting butt hurt wearing mask. freaky thing Spanish flu second wave hit young people harder. second wave ARDS killed people strong immune systems.

Walmart yesterday, big security guy outside front entrance third party security agency yes far know increasing security Ok, German here. wife take test tomorrow basically symptoms, cases anymore county. teacher mild soreness throat enough get test.

I want imagine first day school.

üçèKids get bus. packed together, district (like many) ruled expensive time-consuming staggered bussing. excited see friends, talk, share items, things missed bus, great emotional health. Eventually take masks, one two kids come one begin with, who's scared thing anyway?

And so, 10am, first super-spreader event district. No, kids may get sick, will. die, we've seen news reports. probably child, matter you. sacrifice prepared make.

üçèKids enter school. done staggered manner, lose significant instructional time. Kids sit desks, Title school parents afford stay home support kids Digital Learning, least 80% population classroom. classroom truly socially distanced desks seat 8 people. Realistically, 25-30 children packed together. play masks or, parents anti-mask, refuse masks on.

üçèA teacher teach classroom longer allowed group activities, vital young learners, unless contactless digital format. Hopefully school enough computers students without devices. Hopefully teacher able maneuver quickly enough stop students Snapchatting friends, logging number non-educational websites, lesson.

A teacher also choose instructing effectively protecting people may care home. Proximity key classroom management. Social distancing compatible it. Students wear masks may see reduced teacher attention, again, teachers asked choose health effectiveness.

üçèLunchtime arrives. Students take masks eat. district, eating classrooms, school's windows open. Staggered lunches help masks students eating talking and, miss friends, clustering together. teacher choose eating, separating students, health.

üçèTime change classes. students ones transitioning, instead teacher rotating classrooms, lose valuable instructional time sanitizing. enough wipes sprays sanitize four times day? Hopefully donated some, teacher may choose finances everyone's health.

üçèNovel study time. enough books 100+ middle schoolers? make laugh. Every student need sanitize touching book. pay ebooks pay physical books, hope donate hand sanitizer.

üçèChorus. Orchestra. Band. Theatre. teachers talking reducing class sizes 80+ middle high schools. 30+ elementary. Reducing them. safety.

üçèTime go home. Students get bus again. second super-spreader event occurs across district.

üçèNow, let's talk things go Day 1:

A child tests positive COVID-19. parents fear retaliation peers report school; keep child home hope blows over.

A child sick fever. parent gives Tylenol sends school.

A child interacted child whose parents report tests positive parents report this. Students teachers interacted child quarantine 14 days. (Teachers also required point use sick time, too). That's 14 days Digital Learning trying avoid first place. middle school, teacher tests positive, mean 100+ kids staying home parents, teachers, too. happen again. promised consistency, routine, structure, everything wanted children, gone, prepared help DL.

A child community high COVID-19 exposure becomes sick MIS-C. children contract MIS-C. sacrifice realize making, affect child, concern you.

üçèNow community spread.

The virus find many opportunities flourish school, matter carefully teachers staff strive curb it. resources simply given them. Children spread virus parents, siblings, grandparents (especially multigenerational homes), inevitably, people shop work outside homes. Teachers bring home families, putting all, especially high risk, family members risk death. spike see now, began June, pale comparison follows.

üçèAnd teachers, nurses, custodians, cafeteria workers, paras, clerical staff, principals die. that's footnote you; learning outcomes? academic gains?

Well? be? anyone experience Walgreens/CVS testing sites? reliable accurate rapid tests? Thank you! People already shot killed masks. security guard Dollar Store poor dude working Waffle House shot killed refusing service due masks. Walmart another level, wont first gun incident. needed scream-chortle-cry-into void: can't believe older extended family member - absolute picture Murican health - first threw indoor party 40+ people (also older, also much Murican stereotypes) taking nice long roadtrip Alabama Tennessee... returning classroom next month.

That family member comparatively well educated pillar local community pro-mask, etc, etc. Better lot peers. that's ""best"" rural areas do, screeeeeeaming indictment days.

I can't, man.  I'm certain we'll see murder doors. hope cops it. Oh man, thats gonna piss many Trumplicans. Expect shooting occur soon. Nice. things help:

That's need president listen health professionals turn agree tackle this. That's done Netherlands. prime minister meetings local CDC (and others) and, advice brought public national television general advice. advice measures taken prime minister sets motion.

Ofcourse that's also Fauci hoped for.

EDIT: way. CDC technical briefings government broadcasted live television. briefing government goes hours long debate virus do, also broadcasted national television. America same? Two thing, first: I‚Äôm teacher. assumed was, apparently can‚Äôt comprehend concept wanting keep others safe even though won‚Äôt effect personally.

Second: supremely shitty takes this. makes sound like idiot. ashamed yourself. Cheers. detailed stats Canada 10% confirmed cases hospitalized. hit rate (portion tests come back positive) consistently 1%, pretty hopeful missing huge number cases. Cool, think okay people get tested again, taking others even one yet, need basketball. okay taxpayers funding it.

This everyone calls Americans selfish greedy, is. can, mean should.

Also, reagents tests test kits themselves. run PCR, example, need dNTPs, Taq, primers. involved test kits. test kits swab containment unit. suspect know talking about. Seriously? live Oregon seems like everyone decided vacation summer.

They want crisis quickly get back business, cinemas, restaurants, bars businesses suffering. Would suspect supply chains getting hammered much traditional supply chains. I'm advocating did, put 139 clients unnecessary danger. least found realistically masks save lives. So, taking logic step further:

In Washington State, RCW [26.44.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020) ""Abuse Neglect"" defined ""Abuse neglect"" means sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, injury child person **circumstances cause harm child's health, welfare, safety**, excluding conduct permitted RCW [**9A.16.100**](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.100);""

(RCW 91.16.100 basically carve disciplinary action curb bad behavior).

A person could read knowingly sending child school pandemic would meet definition.

So, assuming states similar definition ""Abuse Neglect"" comes Child Abuse, could theoretically point parents could charged various child abuse statutes sending kids school pandemic.

That interpretation, coupled school employees legally designated mandatory reporters places US, could get interesting... Nice! Seriously... way I'd go Walmart days!! given honest go finding information either looking correct keywords I'm illiterate. appreciate anyone's attempt help find answer.

I fly soon, want follow self-quarantine rules closely possible. There's testing available wondering there's sort testing window? need wait period time flying getting test make sure accurately reflects status? 
e.g. fly arrive destination 4 PM, somehow get tested 4:30 PM, would test results accurate? could stop quarantine getting results back? empathize, wearing mask eight hours day gets annoying. work I'm rarely around folk less issue still, eight hours nonstop would pain ass, nose break camel's back. whisper wear mask, facial recognition software can't track them. Went Walmart yesterday Florida I‚Äôm walking everyone mask except one old guy. greeters looking hands preoccupying random shit actually checking people. poor workers inside look others wearing masks wrong walking aisles wrong way instead correcting them. don‚Äôt blame though don‚Äôt get paid enough act store security too. definitely political ideology major contributing factor. Tons right wing populations across world reacting masks way. Blaming China someone got sick back November. Refuse wear masks uncomfortable. Refusal change way life gut instinct years conserve things well them.

Anti-intellectualism tool, users want way due principles ideology. probably old photo. Masks required. Thats hilarious

I interesting getting ""gun control"" debate you; topic sub that. Yeah, that's also part point. US put money overseas production help increase manufacturing, specifically US demand greater countries. extremely populous country 329 million. Even emergency use healthcare workers decent amount greater countries working with.

Moderna releases positive data, next day happens. countries also figuring overseas manufacturing deals themselves? mostly fairly wealthy countries list. Even US put money overseas vaccines purpose increasing manufacturing, risk.

Rather try figure share limited manufacturing, also share risk boosting manufacturing.

It's going much easier figure fair distribution make more. arrange deals manufactures help financial backing, significant issues increasing manufacturing.There need bit equity actually taking risks here, financially speaking. US actually stable financial position normal; cannot funding everyone right now.

I super critical US government, also think done instance.

Just let us enjoy rest moment first though. misstep yes. corrected along CDC. course would better err side caution recommend everyone wear masks walk back data showed masks fact effective rather recommend begin with.

Call senator demand passage relief funding Strange conspiracists pre 2016 would calling end world, Illuminati, new world order. But, trump cult leader somehow able convert every damn one it‚Äôs rational left ones calling conspiracies become clear. 

Is real life terrible dream? question might able answer. Let‚Äôs say got COVID, recover go protections place, thinking immune getting again. understand, immunity decline time. However, would still decline continually exposed virus, therefore immune system maintain immunity? COVID, went public kept getting exposed it, would immunity still decline? thus great karen wars began blame social media filter bubbles.

Now guy sitting there, seeing China beat virus economy returning normal, US economy falling apart. someone pushed trade war, obsession economy money, pride, right now, US, extension himself, losing China humiliating way possible.

That's explanation hates Fauci: actions Fauci suggested is, him, equivalent total capitulation economic war think US fighting China, 130k Americans die war, that's sacrifice he's willing take.

Because cop gets trouble hurting someone wearing mask, enforcing law.

Pretty much like everything else.

Oh, one thing, carry guns, obviously use them, lot people afraid question police officer you.

That never good thing, reality.

Also, public opinion, high cones cops, also pretty low comes anti-maskers.

Although lot ‚Äúnon- violent‚Äù people there, people lot say ‚Äúanti-masker‚Äù.

Some people may hate cops, cops lot people believe quarantine, people refuse follow directions, could prevent spread disease.

Its life-or-death issue people, a-lot people loved ones.

So someone trying to, possibly could end hurting family, don‚Äôt think would try handle self, believe lot people might call police.

Or least make report something dose happen evidence.. LOL! Yeah okay. teach university level, get say someone decade.

TLDR: no, Walmart require masks practice. words. You‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll starve then!‚Äù  

I say that. decision. Stop trying blame me. makes look like ass. grown person chronic medical condition wish could ignore.  

We've already seen movie. last time store manager two cops telling lady enter even though documented psychiatric condition prevented wearing mask. (The cops forced admit California law forbidden inquiring anyone's medical condition) Voices raised. Threats issued.

See word ‚Äúhaving‚Äù there? lot people choice. lot terrified go work.

The article refers people choice (as masks) don‚Äôt believe it. Sure, think it‚Äôs likely workers protesters care social distancing (or masks).

But OP singled protesters they‚Äôre idiots, tried point necessarily case. Also, I‚Äôm curious know (and you) think Trump rallies, protesting masks (none trying achieve anything greater good). people like 2020. understand it. Yes, you‚Äôre also disregarding classes in-person means people left FL March escape virus made come back it‚Äôs even worse. Even precautions university, still Florida. 

If truly got engage class felt comfortable take others online think would reasonable - options currently fully-remote modified in-person between. example, made still orchestra (up 100 people). without precautions rotating groups it‚Äôs never full orchestra, still irresponsible. 

Allowing students choose seems good, students going make wrong choice. Maybe programs makes sense - I‚Äôm allowing nuance - allow whole university come back? It‚Äôs irresponsible. I'm expert THINK see they're injecting (tobacco family) plants vaccine base, rapidly develops response plant spreads. material plant creates response isolated refined, enhanced boosters injected humans.

Why tobacco (or tobacco cousins) ? far I've ever read Tobacco one 'friendly' plants use research like used decades medical research.  propose deal influx cases deaths less less compliance? kept stressing couldn‚Äôt tell us safe not. could give us tips make ‚Äúsafer‚Äù.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

On April 3, 2020, White House Coronavirus Task Force CDC recommended persons wear cloth face covering public slow spread COVID-19.

**What added report?**

After initial recommendation released, high rates cloth face covering use reported United States. increase rate cloth face covering use observed April May sustained, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks races, Hispanics, persons aged ‚â§39 years, persons living Northeast.

**What implications public health practice?**

Public health messages target audiences wearing cloth face coverings reinforce positive attitudes, perceived norms, personal agency, physical health benefits obtaining wearing cloth face coverings consistently correctly.   worldwide pandemic absolutely needed solid top leadership. federal government print money existence , states cant. state rainy day fund fed doesnt give money shutdown would moot wouldnt able pay hospitals stay open pay keep electric grid alive.

NY Cali might economic juggeenauta bizarre would sell bonds rhe international market pay bills fed completely decided pre-emptively problem much work even bother with? better cop entrance cause dangerous idiots go bonkers. That's deaths per 100,000 people. 35.9. Fredericksburg? Masks objectively reduce spread. Period. Watching much trump man Wait, ya'll gettin paid? May they've changed minds since then. great source info lmao there's benefit, not? mild inconvenience worst. 
Also, I'm pretty sure article bullshit. reduce number tests, ensure tests processed less 24 hours. Better 500k tests 24 hours 1m tests 1 week. Kind darkly ironic wife people around wearing mask protest.... still people keep news/ care following protocol.

Secondly, Trump seems pretty good allies Covid, he‚Äôs friends Putin Xi. Covid bribe alliance. note, article, there's issue:

""UnitedHealthcare paid 70 cents every dollar premium revenue second quarter, compared last year's claims expense 83 cents every dollar premium revenue.""

I assumed standard operating procedureüò≤ point worry getting reprimanded. point damage Fauci's credibility. 

And base care came opposed attack. message successfully delivered. high level politics. 

I worked politics decade Hill. # noice. They're super serious time. 

My state mask mandate like half people every store wear anything. massive fines repercussions towards businesses following mask orders, nothing change. really think over, least one Walmart employee murdered this. 

I spent six years Walmart employee see nasty customers get. Michigan Kroger shopper, tell absolutely HATED Kroger's ""policy"" since started - taken seriously day one. Let's see changes.

Up point, even though county REQUIRES masks, they've treated masks ""recommended"" done SHIT enforce them. seriously doubt actually ""enforce"" new improved policy, shall see.

Kroger main store, probably spend well excess $10K per year there. spend dropped 50+% since started they've handled SO. FREAKING. \*\*POORLY\*\* since started. actually gone Kroger since early March stuck curbside pickup only..but even sucks, get nearly expired already expired produce, meat, etc. Fatty meat. Browning produce. Or, even better..60-70%, LUCKY, order placed. Yeah, I'm grateful there's even option curbside..but last order, told RED ONION ""out stock"". SERIOUSLY? I've shopped 20+ years. NEVER Red Onion ""out stock"". whole process just..broken, likely, person picking feel like fulfilling red onion. dozens dozens similar, ""fun"" stories Kroger pickup. basically giant PITA even though grateful there's even option..

Sure would nice able go back local Kroger again. damn well better actually ENFORCE new policy I'll ever consider it. detail used cars? plan? people blood hands. makes even worse government like ""nah fuck wanna hear it"" Texas sailed past infection death stats New York went full lockdown, they're far, far less. Combine political opposition wearing masks think they're anywhere near keeping growing exponentially. CNN reported squirrel tested positive so... yep Hey, double every day FYI. Don‚Äôt forget Pittsburgh west. State College pretty quiet Penn State closed since spring break. would need clinics staffed people qualified give shots. can't rush task without hurting people. easy feat. Done deal Massachusetts. Plus workers posted entrances exits iPads keep count many people store times keep occupancy 40% Go look OP responding - asks Canada.  

Stop amusing bullying, especially misplaced is. sides! western cultural bias Asians sound medical consensus. white countries telling people wear masks every East Asian country promoting heavily. governor (WV) recently mandated masks public places. nearest Kroger sign says ""masks requested"". I'm really curious going enforced store. general good portion people still refuse wear masks. Ugh. Guess who's gonna lose bunch southern business.... """"There small businesses spend fortune trying help please governor separate things like outdoor dining ... [putting] plastic walls up, kinds crazy things help safer, goes shuts us [down] again,"" gym owner Mike Ends told Los Angeles ABC station KABC.""

He really believes safety features also attempt please governor ???? crazy safety features ??? business owner would want support. feel like enough intelligence self-reflection learn hard way, mean life smart. diss people prefer learning hard way, that's roll. still ""real"". hope might intending hire additional, train security expected pushback. Rather putting service workers position try enforce this. mean, that's always hero meant. People get harms way expected pay price others to.

Same thing military, they're calling heroes giving empty worship time giving proper mental healtcare building spikes overpasses homeless can't sleep there. work Fresh, dealing customers needing help Supplying meat, produce, bakery items. It‚Äôs mostly nonstop communication customers giving helping hand. crew gets sent cart work well. bonuses go certain amount cents many hours you‚Äôve worked (doesn‚Äôt add well tax). &amp; many associates would definitely feel comfortable type greater payout virus going on, hell Im sure lot people time. time manager bad mouthing acting ignorant people. afford pay workers living wage are... That‚Äôs Karen calls cops feels threatened. Masks worn quite while. site good info: one can't. People need stop acting like outliers norm. Wow. it‚Äôs 20 min wait test 24 hours results. Seems like hardest hit states like FL already data. Considering public health issue criminal. person said don‚Äôt wear them.

The people who‚Äôs job tell us shouldn‚Äôt done! discredited that. It‚Äôs deciding wear mask, country large. Many think masks hoax waste time leadership. president, Fauci, governor mayors. Oregon state order masks everywhere indoors Kroger absolutly nothing it. dont beleive say now. people use Walmart.. people walmart part identity. leave FB. mind reading random people saying dumb shit, can't listen old friends relatives saying anymore.

Well we're cancelling special ed least. asked 996 employees airfare hotel departments Shanghai call center whether would beinterested working home four days week, fifthday office.4 Approximately half employees (503) wereinterested

What's next complaint? That's fucking ridiculous. puking afterwards outside though. fine wear mask outside. wear outside go grocery store run quick errands, seems easier put minutes later entering store walking busy street really bother me, i'm walk take different mask easier carry around neck pull there's people around, might similar seeing, simply convenience. Seems US only. Cut water power. plan it. Also, kiss ass. Daniel lions den. ""Amalgamated"" bigger cities denser populations much harder control spread. cities prop fund country. I'm sure sick amalgamated listen endless tripe. average US, flu's death rate .1%, coronavirus' death rate viruses deadly elderly. flu kills .83% infected people age 65, whereas coronavirus's death rate 10.4% infected people age 65 74, 20.8% 75-84 group, 30.1% people 85.

Just idea shitty is, last time saw nurses doctors dying treating flu patients? happened China, many said hiding worse numbers, yet super skeptical happening US despite US taking far less effective measures it.

This sort bad news Republican administration crippling CDC. Lol mortality rate like .04%(on higher estimates). hell 10%. 10% even non-worryworts would looting stores moving mountains.

Also people dying old living fixed income. would describe ""10% care-free spending consumers"" disagree... discussions lean towards ""this person deserves die"" tend lead bans reddit. special education teacher want create plan actually concerns them. 8:1:1 kids going daycares 15 plus kids. safer? less kids actually school. shouldnt throw special education aside difficult. 3 parents school want kids back person fall. time, Walmart.  oh gotcha....yeah wise move. wife says shut shes infected.....ah well Hopefully they‚Äôll like fucking waste air. kill anyone lose gun rights 

I see absolute win...  Same! family want mask. Fuck. Cell phone data. I'm pleased hear this. nice cook American food again. Although, never grateful live Asian neighborhood safe Asian grocery store, miss comfort food.

However, important reinforce encourage fence already practicing good habits. area vocal anti maskers, covid-deniers, hope kind content least reinforce listening acting responsibly. Trump.

Maybe it‚Äôs hard convince people take seriously simply isn‚Äôt serious, people‚Äôs lack reaction whole time simply response proportionate threat.

But would thinking critically somehow ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù oh OK, go. 

that reminds short scene recent episode *Yellowstone*. mainly set gigantic ranch near Yellowstone Natl Park Wyoming (or Montana? forget); fairly rural words. female lead goes nearest convenience store &amp; notices ""please give money"" jar help pay sick kid's cancer treatment.

Like work hospital leak famous celeb got admitted youd get fired, possibly arrested Nailed it. Good. Every time I've go groceries Walmart city, 30-40% wore masks. stare wear one. really help think since Walmart huge especially there's one ""town Walmart"" like old neighborhood. I'm bigger city almost stores this... except Walmart. flock. need precious Donald get sick costs! He‚Äôs important! Thank you. Well said. corona virus flu virus What's best possible outcome someone Trump actually fire? Reduce amount damage that's done? Commit fewer crimes otherwise done?

Fuck people. could done virus moving on, promise it'll carried school year 2021. country full fucking garbage people I'm tired it. There's reasoning relating ""so feel attacked"". Fuck all.

Brace yourselves, Karens coming Biden reinstate good standing I've gone nonewnormal somewhat disturbing, though agree person replied likely disinformation campaign rather organic forum.

However, phenomenon occurs internet, radical extreme beliefs spread given legitimacy real person sees sub-consciously concludes ""other people think this, beliefs must true"", adopt radical stupid beliefs.

Because that, would refrain linking sub. going get found people want believe masks bad, forum grow. currently 2000 ""subscribers"", many hope suspect fake. gets linked referenced real people find stupid beliefs warped validated.

So, like said link tell people check out. Think communities like virus. Spreading link allows virus proliferate. Quarantine isolate slow growth.

That's opinion though, I‚Äôm pointing stresses out. I‚Äôm pointing shouldn‚Äôt public health planning around short term immunity important contingency plan for. 

Looking US, appear going herd immunity. could realistically happen coronavirus acts like coronaviruses currently common circulation. youngest IEP that's met whining wrong tree.

Walmart going arm health ambassadors? Thumbs moronic experiment. Thumbs results. country requiring people work covid wards? ever say that? making stuff pleasure?

~~Call old fashioned, worry Oxford mRNA vaccines used first time humans. know science know safe, first time nerves.~~ I'm glad effectively almost one vaccine main type moving stage 3 production.

* Sinovac (inactivated)

Production could big risk fast track vaccine deployment actually work. two production:

And STILL haven‚Äôt acknowledged actual argument. You‚Äôve constantly revealed much brainlet lost cool. run circles around you. don‚Äôt live username all. Good point. seems sustained high point. mean one couple scenarios happening:

1. We've reached nearly reached testing limits, percent positive rate continue rise cases remain relatively stable.

2. Cases topped begin level fall, case we'll see percent positive rate falling eventually case count fall.

For now, looks like we're scenario #1. watch percent positive rate see way going. get liking guy, c'mon man.

The party compassion acceptance. Big cities areas pretty mask friendly, come majority small towns people/businesses follow mandates all. give everyone money right? went from, OK let's see happens (2016ish), to, come putting foot mouth, Fuck man hell doing?, get motherfucker LOVE carry Knipex.

The truth divided states, mostly urban vs rural right now. large cities (where money made) similar ideals. one name large city mostly red team. like talk big game fighting us, kind civil war, money, education, numbers. really good marketing organizing, seized three branches government though. kind like stalemate. time 70+ pass away religion fading, fight different things, continue move left like Canada Europe. We're weird time right now. long run okay right looks really bad. listen she‚Äôs using scientific data proper sources, simultaneously using experience industry compare.

No, it‚Äôs actually much worse that. currently mask mandate state AZ. stopped prohibiting county/municipal governments acting own. finally 4 weeks ago, ever competent city/county government enacted mask mandate within following day. resident, thank you, see someone without mask, say something, get fucking ass public don‚Äôt wanna help community move forward customers it? That's going get far violations think rich want gobble boomer real estate goes onto market. Plus people evicted foreclosed on. Would moneygrab epic proportions. absurd people flying anywhere right except return home actual article beyond title pretty interesting. much less ""people social distance/wear masks dumb"" along lines ""people create policies need able explain policies way average person understand, rather throwing around industry specific jargon gets ignored"".

It's slogans like ""flatten curve"" ""make America great again"" (or flip side: associating Obama 'change') prompt responses large groups people, ""wear mask might protect you, might not, might protect somebody else, not, studies think probably best wear one"" leaves lot people scratching heads deciding need one.

If come something like ""wear mask save ass"" back February nobody would questioned it.  Literally half posts sub vaccine. really really really hope works soon.

Obviously mask doesn‚Äôt lower oxygen saturation blood, matters most, interesting seem breathing lower concentration oxygen.

To seems going major efforts reduce spread disease ultimately pointless long term, since moment halt efforts, matter long maintained, cases rise previous levels mitigation process reset.

For instance, let's say hypothetically US there's 50,000 cases per day, rather high. Due everyone part, that's reduced 5,000 cases per day. well good. result, economy opens up, people stop wearing masks, \*boom\*, cases spiked again.

I see reason think cycle happen indefinitely.

Is way avoid outcome? way make country open normally completely without reverting back spike cases?

Because answer no, see bother fighting all. Flattening curve useful hospital capacities, sure, beyond we're permanently shutting world delay inevitable.

Bet strapped could draw someone calling mask bull. wANts AtTeNTON! Hopes successful Covid-19 vaccine boosted two leading groups achieved positive early results.

In phase one trial involving 1,000 British volunteers, Oxford University vaccine appears stimulated desired response immune system, *The Times* understands.

The subjects understood shown encouraging levels neutralising antibodies, thought important protecting viral infection, serious side-effects. results also indicated another aspect immune system, known T-cells, mobilised.

The researchers yet prove combined immune response enough protect people infection, found would significant setback. ‚ÄúThe Oxford team much still [the source said.

Moderna, American biotech company, said 45 people given candidate vaccine displayed ‚Äúrobust‚Äù immune response. efficacy trial involving 30,000 Americans due begin July 27.

A third group, Biontech, German company partnership American drugmaker Pfizer, also plans recruit many 30,000 trial subjects United States. two candidate vaccines given ‚Äúfast track‚Äù status US regulators week, allowing expedited testing.

Both Moderna Biontech developing so-called RNA vaccines, technology could allow large numbers doses produced quickly unproven.

The Moderna trial results, published *The* *New England Journal Medicine*, greeted ‚Äúreally quite good news‚Äù Anthony Fauci, director US National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases.

The ‚Äúgold standard protection‚Äù viral infection involves neutralising antibodies, said. ‚ÄúThe data study, small numbers may be, pretty clear vaccine capable inducing quite good \[levels\] neutralising antibodies,‚Äù said. also evidence response T-cells.

Astrazeneca, drugmaker partnering Oxford, cautioned news whether Oxford vaccine worked real world unlikely data gathered much larger trials towards end year.

Nonetheless, developments boosted hopes swift economic rebound lockdown sent shares London-listed stock market drug companies sharply higher.

Astrazeneca Glaxosmithkline (GSK) among top risers blue-chip FTSE 100 index, ended day 112.90 points, 1.8 per cent, higher 6,292.95, still 16.6 per cent since start year. Shares GSK finished 2.9 per cent ¬£16.50 Astrazeneca rose 5.2 per cent ¬£89.96.

Patrik Lang, head equity global strategy Julius Baer, private bank, said: ‚ÄúNews Covid-19 vaccine development provided required shot arm markets \[and\] also see sentiment improving \[a pickup in\] consumer spending across United States Europe.‚Äù

Daniel Davis, professor immunology University Manchester author *The Beautiful Cure*, book immune system, said: ‚ÄúIf confirmed, genuinely thrilling news. truly wonderful see fast achieved.

‚ÄúBut course, there‚Äôs still long way go. know vaccine trigger immune response people. next, need find immune response triggered vaccine powerful enough protect us Covid-19. may stop symptoms transmission hopefully both.‚Äù

Astrazeneca agreed supply [100 million Oxford vaccine UK delivery September October manufacturing plans well way. also plans supply US 300 million doses time. far secured global manufacturing capacity two billion doses.

A 10,000 trial subjects recruited Oxford team UK, along 5,000 Brazil 2,000 South Africa. trial United States involve many 30,000 more.

Eleanor Riley, professor immunology University Edinburgh, said surprised early findings, tallied seen previous vaccines researchers made diseases. ‚ÄúBut good see it, nevertheless,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThe key question responses protect? Protection given. need wait see.‚Äù

Recent studies shown antibodies naturally occur people catch coronavirus quickly fade, raising concerns immunity could lost months. could affect success vaccines Sir Jeremy Farrar, director Wellcome Trust, said parts immune system may also important.

‚ÄúAlthough antibodies may wane, don‚Äôt know means don‚Äôt longer lasting immunity. something understand real implications future vaccine development,‚Äù said.

Sir Mene Pangalos, head pharmaceutical discovery research Astrazeneca, [told *The Times* phase one data Oxford vaccine expected soon. Data larger trials, show whether works, would take longer, added. ‚ÄúEfficacy readouts vaccine towards end year,‚Äù Sir Mene said.

A team Imperial College London developing another RNA vaccine led Robin Shattock. ‚ÄúThe results Moderna Biontech early clinical trials provide encouraging data new technology,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúHowever still need know whether levels induced immunity sufficient prevent infection and/or reduce disease.‚Äù

Professor Shattock added: ‚ÄúShould either candidates shown work, biggest challenge may making globally accessible issues dose, cost production key.‚Äù Yea made science herself.

Fundamentally, ""Parents numero uno, everyone else wrong."" They've always believed that. ask teachers staff country -- know, ones forced teach person. Let's face it, WH contradicted undercut Fauci beginning. trump [retweeted call fire April 13.

Fauci refuses play along absurd circus WH turned country's pandemic response into. I'll never forget watching ""Doctor"" Birx stand silently trump suggested treating people UV light disinfectant could cure.

Edit: /ùíÆùí∂ùìáùí∏ùí∂ùìàùìÇ, obviously, remember conservacultists also use reddit.  No, actually want look numbers. want claim ""well US way people \[country\]"" imply reason US high numbers high population. actually look per-population numbers, suck. compare peak per-day cases current new-case-per-day numbers, horrifying know we're peak yet.

An image tweet came across FB feed days ago flat numbers new cases one particular day (not per capita). reposted percentages: 298/83 million = 0.000359% 
Denmark: 10/5.8 million = 0.000172% 
Sweden: 57/10 million = 0.00057% 
US: 55,442/328 million = 0.00169%  US numbers per capita 3 times Sweden's, almost 5 times Germany's, almost 10 times Denmark's.

I also numbers back, see remember: Italy's worst day something like 10.9 per 100,000 people. France like 13.5 something. Spain, 19.5.

For US 19.5, would 64,000 new cases day. per-day new-case numbers last week (source: ): 

58,411  
59,017  
61,352  
66,627  
63,247  
58,601  
60,021

So go page, scroll countries-by-population, highlight US, Spain, Italy, France. click [this direct Note population, none countries first heard freaking EVER hit US right now.

Ok that's bad, right? Hah. Try [this shows top 6 recent US states, plus California, compared three European countries, 7-day rolling average new cases per million population. brown spike beginning? That's Italy, France, even Spain. That's fucking LOUISIANA. US state. WORSE NOW.

AND. AND. **WE WARNING.** saw happened countries, STILL FUCKED OURSELVES. American exceptionalism finest. sad actually made lol clearly speculation take place future. honestly think Harambe time machine? basically we‚Äôre screwed bought Neck gaiters kids. I‚Äôve taught fold like ninja masks. love it. don‚Äôt leave house much, long-term compliance still requires parental reminders. 

It‚Äôs pandemic - ‚ÄúI don‚Äô wanna‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut age.

PS - youngest son taken calling ‚Äúthe Demic.‚Äù think that‚Äôs rad name it. Research SARs vaccine lost almost funding 2012, still small studies works it. never ""stopped"" millions dollars funneled it.

2003-2012 time spent working towards vaccine many groups. 9 years, yet ""optimistic"" coronavirus (which never coronavirus vaccine ever), 2 years, 18 months. 

It's unrealistic, that's Dr Fauci keeps stating ""cautiously optimistic"". impossible unlikely. understand. see just, seems follows inconvenience temporary setbacks, think people irreperably break life structure things worked whole lives attain, mention possibilities homelessness depleted supplies food thanks hoarders severely reduced production bc shutdowns, significantly limited medical assistance emergencies, forth. hope best ‚Äî right ensure maintain alternative self sufficiency options shit hits fan. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs either sue go bankrupt, went ahead sued. Wow, sounds stupid interview. mean unintelligent every way. individual rights always ended safety others, smoking restrictions, drink driving laws, able yell fire cinema cases even safety like forced wear seat belt.

Edit: also public nudity laws safety all. CALM! Unlikely. body furiously creates antibodies viral attack. vaccine would help someone develop more, body already it. can't get cognitively disadvantaged people wear regular mask think wear aerodynamic biosphere? think employees walmart would enjoy break certain group people Months? No, nothing worry about. point, good test result 3 days leave gives opportunity catch three days flight?

I'm arguing right (tbh, one let us Americans in). doing. Way many people actually believe though  Biostats bioinformatics, BS statistics. Let know process goes. need get well know competition right?  sources data informing data sources include the‚ÄØ[Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases Center Systems Science Engineering (CSSE) Johns Hopkins Red Cross; Census American Community Survey; Bureau Labor Statistics.

Mostly publicly available sources like worldometers does. Numbers typically differ much two, neither really dependent federal government all. 

None infallible though since relies public data. states stop publicly reporting cases, there's nothing really done numbers crawl vital statistics try determine things like excess mortality. Jacobson vs Massachusetts (1905) says state right force vaccines it‚Äôs public health crisis. time smallpox could used COVID. protest basic human decency. 

They may also pro low IQ, sure, it‚Äôs difficult understand positions.  Give rest Wait till foreclosure eviction bans lifted. Millions millions families find street wintertime control pandemic! lay die peaceably? think ruling class push way way way hard us pandemic. Winter coming say going ugly hell Trump going easily win re-election large part heroic efforts combating health crisis. belief.

It's hilariously terrible idea. Yeah there's little dark part thinks, ""these dangerous idiots kinda deserve infected point."" empathy kicks goes ""jesus christ Jeff would tremendously awful way die, take back.""

God hope U.S gets together soon. even live watching insanity making crazy. Trump slap tits need get shit together. Yeah rate 50%. It‚Äôs like dirty apartment neighbor clean, neighbor tries keep roaches out. say put roach traps outside access points apartment theirs, complain that‚Äôs fair. manage exterminate roaches, neighbor roaches. complain roaches going get back apartment, start setting roach traps.

The way keep roaches good come grips fact tons roaches first place, understand happened, correct behavior conditions caused it. know roach traps good. want Mr. Bones wild ride. move Italy, Germany, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, country shit together appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* we're one percent infected. means 99% people yet. Let's say moves 5 times fast winter (who knows)? going 5 times worse least. get much, much worse.

Please understand numbers based study, show scope. Also, 1% confirmed, maybe percent instead 1%. There's room get lot worse. bird shove Trump's rump. Unfortunately US, even maimed honestly embarrassing state, important world. Denouncing trump would make mad start trade war whatever account total population world. coronavirus. Negatives: miss home. miss friends. start realize much miss things hometown despite completely small insignificant lived there. miss able speak English; much love Japanese, speaking day long exhausting mentally. There's also stereotype carry around American wherever go interactions new people strangers sometimes awkward.

Positives: Stability. pay taxes things run efficiently. use well funded maintained railway system. partake great healthcare also cheap. worry violent crime. feel like I'm one bad moment away dying, becoming broke, becoming homeless, becoming sick, etc.

Honestly negatives revolve around emotions, positives revolve around health well-being. feel like made right choice. That‚Äôs explains ur name sucks reduced social interaction 0 could wrap whole thing 2 weeks tops. What? thought discussing things never going happen? long Trump one cronies says need stop politicizing issue let HHS handle it? Take upvote Yep. Sigh little late. countries want move allow Americans. We're public health hazard. Yet aren't, so...here are. Report OSHA? What's point? (Besides ""TESLA B4D!!!11!!11"")

According John Hopkins data tracker, California carrying largest active case load right country (~330k). Even higher Florida Texas. also got 2nd highest number positive cases total country. 

So reiterate, open state back business shitload positive cases, surprised companies start reporting cases internally well. Got him, coach. well whale wants ride current, fair well plankton whale's health speaks health entire ecosystem passing through. knows... maybe whale invasive upset balance nature, sustaining whale expense life surrounding it. economy/GDP matter humanity's wellbeing accounted alongside it, imho. Chinese basketball league resumed long time ago, NBA style bubble too, restriction. hope takes committee agree thing president ""because say so""... President health care professional, especially Trump. honest, surprised. lock strictly cases it‚Äôs high.

Yeah no, ""merely suggest"", know-it-all poor actual knowledge. Wonder there's way could interact people sharing skill. Maybe film videos cooking start YouTube channel?

People sometimes pretend love teachers much, bad times gets tossed window. I've seen social media posts saying things like ""you signed this. work. can't watch kids I'm work. want work situations like this, decided teacher.""

Based I‚Äôve seen Facebook comments, that‚Äôs going happen. 

These people convinced it‚Äôs hoax kind they‚Äôre calling mask-wearers ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù

Buckle folks, it‚Äôs going rough year. ""If everyone wears masks"" telling is; we're going coronavirus long ass time. need billions appropriated research NIH try understand long term effects disease, let alone start treat what's going likely bunch new chronic illnesses. name another vaccination causes fever 40% people take (here, would 150 million Americans get fever)?

Has vaccination every approved widespread use?  Maybe answer question me. one failed malaria drug? something else completely different new? Yeah went viral cause whoever shared blatantly lied picture taken making 4th July party, really June party AZ mask policy. risked people‚Äôs health let die. Wow, country fucked up. called bubble. many people escape time idk. usually bubbles pop 25% everyone playing gets destroyed gets reset zero negative margins. 

The big players ride out. think mask wearing great thing I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs implemented people need time actually get them. 

I read said, simply pointed valid reason immediately require masks public. say people wear masks, imply way cover mouth nose wait 3 weeks mask arrive doorstep.

But whatever, right, worth arguing about. Sorry getting heated - live US seeing half country refuse wear masks made bitter old bastard. one says wearing masks precaution needed. always accompanied guidance hand hygiene, social distancing, staying home sick. even that. There's people gone bar since 2003, sudden wanting go pint. 

Haven't worked since new years day 99', time go renew gym membership! know what's gotten people.  tell know nothing executives publicly run companies sell buy stock. Yeah reading comments post local state board education made Facebook filled parents basically saying kid going wear mask bunch typical anti-science nonsense like CO2 poisoning. read it, dreaded drive bus little month. idiots everywhere convincing absolutely believe know better everyone else. woman Walmart yell wearing mask breaking first amendment rights. can't debate reasons make sense. Thanks! fascinating realise large number people sorts advanced degrees and/or deep areas expertise Reddit. Pretty cool!  ""bUt rIgHtS"" know right? Reddit ridiculous sometimes. Lol mean, states going downplay cases? going stop testing now? good idea hate fucking state much. worst part knowing 4 years Abbott probably get reelected incompetent state Democratic Party is. Thank saying this. many comments angry anti-mask crowd, really huge contingent. many simply uninformed, look stats, it‚Äôs obvious cases deaths far common impoverished communities. guess protests outside lots people wore masks, vs inside gatherings without masks families spend significant time around other, embracing, sitting table etc. 

We full contact tracing, able definitely say things caught. kind hypocritical attack people criticizing federal response ""politicizing"" virus call ""Wuhan Coronavirus"" article announcing completely apolitical event, vaccine progress? Fuck yo masks *Properly 

For love god, meaningless wear one cover mouth *and* nose. apologizes misstatement saying Indianapolis, said township decided go full virtual instead option uncomfortable sending children mortar schools (I know going home/virtual one way another).

As solid plans, impression getting seeing statements given us parents. read, could see rational way make school buildings work pretty much stated asked feedback survey given us asking forum questions (the Washington Township video forum posting response questions. good people panel, props short notice).

You uncomfortable risking health amount. anyone should. fairly certain districts follow suit Washington Township set example others follow. Would insanity to. parent myself, could ask school worker would expect it. Well fork noise. 

In reality, 150k likely dead least 3.5 million it. Half million hospitalized. 

Sounds like dad freaking anger issue. OP start pretending crisis this, April?  Sorry, that's bullshit. Extroverted not, logic reason tells people going around town willy nilly. I've plenty extroverted friends they're responsible. friends might idiots (sorry say). maybe care. working hardest wreck economy. strict lockdown followed 100% mask compliance would far, far better economy heading Good you!

Everyone dying. go outside run risk tripping body apparently thousands dying day. lot Asian cultures wear masks air quality terrible. example, Korea, huge air pollution issue partially due China. addition that, taking sick days lot Asian companies huge no...maybe that's changing bit long time, employees go office every single day. means want get sick infect people, anything get sick/spread sickness.

On top that, Asian countries heavily hit pandemics...I know Korea developed lot pandemic response going MERs.

No question it‚Äôs going worse side-effect profile mature, well-tuned refined vaccine like flu vaccine, anyone expecting otherwise new vaccine insane. gives people low-grade fever absence anti-pyretics day, even that‚Äôs high number, nobody going care 1) that‚Äôs hell lot better *infection* 2) ibuprofen acetaminophen exist.

The important thing life-threatening reactions reactions, even severe ones highest dosage isn‚Äôt taken forward, self-resolving. Dr. Anthony Fauci (head NIAID, editor Harrison‚Äôs) said today, matter slice it, good news. revolution better, literally 30 million starving would literally start surgically putting people order work. nephew area won‚Äôt wear mask said believes ‚Äòheard‚Äô immunity.

Additionally, Law covenant ancient Israel (think Leviticus) included provisions quarantine, social distancing covering faces case infectious disease (specifically leprosy).

So Bible belters *should* precautions...

The messaging obviously flattening curve, approach world aiming overloading system causing people die lack care. Sure, spread about, remove largest spreading long people follow simplest instructions. taking comment context.  saying limited supply masks needs used health care workers sick. general public.

Ideally, everybody could/should masks, possible. So, basically, saying... ""please use masks medical staff needs every mask find.""

The message shared Canada, reason. need keep border closed long possible. Idiot Americans come wearing masks making us go lockdown, like country. Literarily first time, one wants go America. Rest easy. ones working vaccine. global effort race effective vaccine. really quite amazing entire scientific medical community pouring this. everyone 40% thinks fine. think alternative party black brown people horrible. 

The 20% middle worst. know wrong. love racism tax cuts hence cool poor people brown people dying. funny part comments three vertical dots end (at least mobile) Fuck owners bar &amp; anybody showed up. people pieces shit I'm curious, choose them? feel risk something major happening small enough? I'm sure depression going solely affect US. Idk. love it. easy lose empty shell story. Itt fun every time. quite old enough Now, yes, months already flattened curve.

It helps avoid spread measures got us here, masks. COVID you‚Äôre waiting week know it, you‚Äôre also likely delaying treatment.

That drive mortality rate people tell it‚Äôs something else. Loved it! Well considering America full idiots, surprise article gives people new ideas consider. Fauci made lot big mistakes people aware of. Please let know find mistakes article! weird time people somehow decided politicians honest medical, research statisitical institutions dishonest California inside like 3 months straight numbers still rising. Would face shields work? There's tutorials DIYing plastic 2 liter soda bottle, could probably make child sized stay top head. 

A group scientists published piece Lancet (basically top notch scientific journal) suggesting face shields equally good better alternative face masks. go anywhere know, Americans. don‚Äôt deserve live old Ohh shit. Corona boutta get ass kicked can‚Äôt become federal mandate? don‚Äôt think anyone going let Americans in. Wow. heard story. every bit bad described... need go fund throw money Goodbye New York‚Äôs virus-free dreams then... agree. tiny crack light end tunnel. gives hope. Yes, Dane County started yesterday. Anyone indoors, one's home, must wear mask. side effects sound less severe COVID-19. worst side effects high dose moving forward with. good friend mine lives Hanoi keeping posted. she‚Äôs told me, correct ‚Äì VN start. particular, fuck around came mask mandate. remember sending mask selfies back January February know lockdown too. contemplated coming home expatriation flight April discouraged her. She‚Äôs much safer Hanoi stateside. coworkers came back US told deeply regret decision. Unfortunately, situation states means may able go back jobs Vietnam. even dumber realize arm last year. making poor decisions (either poor per opinion poor objectively given hindsight information now).

They making poor decisions could result lost human lives. Saying n-word result lost human lives. one serious? silly. gonna come stronger mouth wtf going avoid social distancing. Yeah will, soon see cheap flight boca.   fatality rate adults 20-49 .0092%  Population density important. I'm UK, rural-ish area cases wraps quite while, wonder London (and similar cities like NYC) got hit hard: normal circumstances people *packed* tube trains (subways), outright contagious respiratory condition spread, even outside transport busy, easy spread.

 Meanwhile, 'burbs sticks, everyone's cars, shops packed, people gardens fresh air... makes real difference transmission. even people complacent- circulating, even slower, can't know badly affect loved ones :/ Haha sounds good. make sure quarantine 14 days :) Nah, USA going dealing years. know downvoted here. someone outside drinking beers socializing, they're everything can. understand biased reason (appears political);

How could possibly come conclusion linked fucking SEVENTY scientific papers LITERALLY effect wearing read established epidemiologic material then, math. math change.

The BLOG linked (yes someones BLOG) LITERALLY calls use face masks general public. dumb even read posting.

TLDR - made post saying masks work linked source 'prove' FUCKING SAYS COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

You're absolute bellend.

Political? Aye, fucking sit absolute gimp. would thrilled quickly. idea physical South Koreans get. Even old ladies mind getting physical while. Good know. run cycle hour twice week (on empty trails). people running trials probably studied lot medical ethics have. 


My guess there's higher moral imperative integrity vaccine millions people take future. lesser moral imperative hundreds lives may may save today cutting corners (e.g. playing fast loose side-effects). still think NFL year.  Ship people US bought seven cute bandanas wash bunch every week always clean. normal masks car case. It‚Äôs simple. many things mad spend energy on. Makes sad people selfish, ignorant can‚Äôt literal bare minimum fellow humans. car protest right didnt result mass rioting dozens deaths hundreds shootings. Thats high optical contact matter spin it. bad won‚Äôt happen. even fully know say here, that's strange response. 

Ok, well starters, change it, trials again. There's indication that's doing. 

Moreover, answer something well trials ""well, use something different""? That's strange thing say. Conversely, say needed wear masks? open schools Disney anyway... approval numbers

I'm surprised realized that's impossible. wished masks helped prevent getting help prevent spreading it. I'd perfectly fine anti maskers. Wow. People shopping town‚Äôs WalMart mostly masked. Way go Sun Prairie, Wisconsin! Trump always right, ask him. top reasons keep hearing ""anti-maskers"" FB are: 
""I refuse live fear"" 
""I sheep"" 
""I suck government's dick"" 
""Hospitals want cases get money treat people virus"" 
""If mask works wear one?"" 
""The survival rate 99.9% what's risk?"" 

I understand anyone selfish. ü§ûü§û become millionaire next nths. WTF America. yeah people totally masks... tens thousands people packed streets like sardines, protesting... like virus begun spreading community. well faaiirr, knows he'll likely dead spring. ninth day July. 14. talk people wearing mask staying 6 feet apart

This believe extroversion, all. selfish assholes. Toddlers happen inhabit adult bodies. Good! Things get much worse here, I'm heading home Canada! teachers strike want die school administrators start understand gravity problem. economist listen to, Mark Blyth, Micheal Hudson, Yanis Varoufakis, Joseph Stiglitz think average American screwed possible recovery continue current economic system. 

Basically calling things like forgive everyone's debt (so banks screwed), policy help poor (increase wages, subsidize cost living cheaper education/healthcare/transportation), Green New Deal climate disaster 50x worse pandemic terms economic damage.

But course, another perspective average American already screwed 2019, pandemic. Half nation negative net worth, debt (department education among biggest loan shark America). even $500 bank account, half American household credit buy cheapest $17000 new car market. Rubbing eyes nose mostly. ever ventilator? think science set stone? think learned covid daily basis?

at one point time cigarettes prescribed people asthma Milwaukee pushing mandatory mask order believe signed mayor. I'm excited tears, also hopefully curve shot way fuck come back down. somehow medical professionals seem rather tame criticism protests. afraid something? Honestly, exact kind protests something like white nationalism, doubt media reaction same.  Whatever gotcha term want use, understand made claim. theory people believe pushed media. crazy someone would buy it. We're going die arent 6 countries [never wore seem fine. we‚Äôd rather destroy economy millions lives, thanks tho That‚Äôs exactly said. red pill won‚Äôt save you, kids, disease. Democracy sad one turtle face? Lol good luck America Coming together common cause? THAT'S COMMUNISM! word would triggered automod lol? sounds simple paper! Grad school 100% table soon campus thing again. Cases rise Colorado too. Nothing crazy yet coming. Traffic nearly back normal front range. matter time. Polis great federal push reopen. Since he's governed like republican. He'll get tv tell people wear masks backbone enough make mandatory. He's neo-liberal put money lives. agree, least February current administration [did daily reminder government plenty time prepare chose causing shortage PPE supplies. think everyone around world crying foul. unexpected though. First CDC told everyone masks waste time, instead telling people buy masks preserve healthcare workers.


Before community spread need THEN, flipping masks, told socially distance, far right wing protesters putting everyone danger. messaging came scientists government.


They protesting wearing masks en masse dangerous situation community spread something worthwhile protest came up, told go protest. Even EPIDEMIOLOGISTS flipped overnight (likely terrified canceled colleges employ them), started telling people go protest.


First I'm glad agree worthwhile protest. Secondly mask use BLM protests far much higher thus safer Right's protest wear masks open everything face pandemic average person, political, smart, given mixed messaging know believe. ignore whatever easiest, living regular life.

Sadly things change. Entropy one constants life. stay date them. Sorry. blame disaster lies squarely with

the Right's constant refusal deal reality. Religion invented keep poor murdering rich.

It‚Äôs always class war. context protests Florida happened anti-maskers fuming cops escorted sandwich shop, group thirty adults got together Corona Party Texas one dies due COV, four months heat teachers retiring early hard ""nope!"" various states mandated governors reopen fall CDC saying horrible idea huge ramifications. Yeah... Hope Americans wanted visit anyone EU, Canada, Mexico, Australia, rest civilized world late 2021. St.charles isn‚Äôt requiring masks that‚Äôs it‚Äôs high(I used live family none wear mask it‚Äôs complete shit show!). I‚Äôm suburbs Kansas City require mask stl don‚Äôt know st.charles doesn‚Äôt! stupid. Everything Trump makes much sense ask ‚Äúhow would action benefit Putin.‚Äù

One would think Trump‚Äôs interest re-election get coronavirus situation control boost economy. However, conflicts Putin‚Äôs efforts destabilize US. believe original messaging really driving ""anti-mask"" fiasco. 

At least CDC admitted messaging wrong reason so.

It seems illogical anti-mask folk part point CDC go ""Oh, wrong something....I can't believe anything say again."", administration wrong dozens times still believe follow.

It also seems odd ""in face"" it.  think works, fine. going kill wear one 20 minutes someone else's property ask one? would think so. *Then got covid and...*

This common human reaction - particularly among ""I invincible"" age range.

That kid actually poked eye running scissors, though... set least 5 years ago. gotten harder do. time pretty easy. came generic common name, generic background (graduated really big high school, worked really big employer, etc). Facebook recommended bunch people might know graduated high school... sent bunch friend requests - hilarious many people happily accept, figured, like 2000 people graduating class, really going remember all? got critical mass actually got friend requests people, friended many people gone school with. LOL.
I know method weed out, Facebook throw people connection suggested friends list... always play safe friend request people good connections to.

For picture, profile pic stole somewhere random online, put gaussian blur on, could kind tell looked like, really. Eventually ended using face generated one online artificial face generating programs- unique headshot, person actually exist. Good luck facial recognition bots there. He's nice looking guy, got great smile.

Now need discrete phone number new account, know else. They've gotten better it. USA: get assaulted berated wearing mask floridians enter anywhere 50 states 50 governments 50 sets leaders 50 regional cultures fighting other, person high enough position tell everyone shut fuck get program busy looting denying science gleefully making problem worse would without input

Yeah we're completely fucked Well, impossible get everyone wear mask suggestion, virus due mutation time 6 months ago be/can infected again. TL;DR - Minorities likely live densely populated areas, medical conditions linked racial housing segregation (like pollution asthma), difficult fully disinfect stuff, harder stock food/supplies, likely take public transportation, people household, over-represented prisons/jails/detention centers/homeless shelters, likely essential workers, less ability work home, less financial security quit risky jobs, financially unable visit doctors, dealt systemic racism healthcare system. there's probably things even covered 

Down bottom: conditions**

 - Many members racial ethnic minorities may likely live densely populated areas institutional racism form residential housing segregation. addition, overcrowding likely tribal reservation homes Alaska Native villages, compared rest nation. People living densely populated areas homes may find harder practice social distancing.

 - Racial housing segregation linked health conditions, asthma underlying medical conditions, put people increased risk getting severely ill dying COVID-19. communities higher numbers racial ethnic minorities higher levels exposure pollution environmental hazards.

 - Reservation homes likely lack complete plumbing compared rest nation. may make handwashing disinfection harder.

 - Many members racial ethnic minority groups live neighborhoods farther grocery stores medical facilities, may lack safe reliable transportation, making harder stock supplies would allow stay home receive care sick.

 - members racial ethnic minority groups may likely rely public transportation, may make challenging practice social distancing

 - People living multigenerational households multi-family households (which common among racial ethnic minority groups), may find hard protect older family members isolate sick space household limited.

 - racial ethnic minority groups over-represented jails, prisons, homeless shelters, detention centers, people live, work, eat, study, recreate within congregate environments, make difficult slow spread COVID-19.

#**Work circumstances** 

 - types work workplace policies put workers increased risk getting COVID-19. Members racial ethnic minority groups likely work conditions. Examples include:

  * essential worker: risk infection may greater workers essential industries, health care, meat-packing plants, grocery stores, factories. workers must job site despite outbreaks communities, may need continue working jobs economic circumstances.

  * sick leave: Workers without paid sick leave may likely keep working sick.

  * Income, education, joblessness: average, racial ethnic minorities earn less non-Hispanic whites, less accumulated wealth, lower levels educational attainment, higher rates joblessness. factors affect quality social physical conditions people live, learn, work, play, impact health outcomes.


#**Health circumstances**

Health healthcare inequities affect many racial ethnic minority groups. inequities put people increased risk getting severely ill dying COVID-19.

 - Compared non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics almost 3 times likely uninsured, non-Hispanic blacks almost twice likely uninsured. age groups, blacks likely non-Hispanic whites report able see doctor past year cost. 2017, almost 3 times many American Indians Alaska Natives health insurance coverageexternal icon compared non-Hispanic whites.

 - People may receive care distrust healthcare system, language barriers, cost missing work.

 - Compared non-Hispanic whites, blacks experience higher rates chronic conditions earlier ages higher death rates. Similarly, American Indian Alaska Native adults likely obesity, high blood pressure, smoke cigarettes non-Hispanic white adults. 

 - underlying medical conditions may put people increased risk severe illness.

 - Racism, stigma, systemic inequities undermine prevention efforts, increase levels chronic toxic stress, ultimately sustain health healthcare inequities. Well, 40% America approves Trump right 2/3rds isn‚Äôt far math Mississippi something *good* change?

Looks like another state going need take ""Worst state"" title MS done it! took day reply with.....that. 

I guess I'll equally unimaginative: Cool story, bro.  Bandanas crappy masks lot effective nothing. It‚Äôs quantity it‚Äôs quality. guys climbed mountain get point. employ millions ppl. Tax them, u can‚Äôt it. Probably wise, trust either.  don‚Äôt call orange curtain nothing. 99.9 % survival rate.  way government could make possible us stay home worry mortgages, rent, groceries, etc. kind welfare people instead giant corporations large political donors. Nah, would never work. died loved miss Fauci think now. Wait 2021. year be! Go get em Lindsey, slimey two faced bastard. Irrelevant. One guy said it, matters. Graphs statistics, backed data history? Get shit here. Doesn‚Äôt everyone get yet? rules don‚Äôt apply rich powerful. never have. happens every. Single. Day. yet people continue get amnesia shocked SHOCKED rich powerful ever want. Sometimes there‚Äôs token appeasement unwashed masses don‚Äôt catch on, apparently seems working great. 

Until everyone country respects laws we‚Äôre always going getting screwed. solid advance. lot times things huge impact revolutionary like wheel cell phones; incremental improvement. example switching DC AC; ""simple"" increase efficiency; allowed electric revolution.   know like live often admire solidarity. Fauci say going cruises March, **after** Italy China announced lockdowns affecting tens millions people. track record. piece cloth put nose mouth? President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho! scared, stay home. Simple that.

if simple. people go work can't depend unemployment government handouts. everyone bit bullet, suffered bit weeks, we'd save lot suffering much longer time.

But fuck right? winning move point might point kaRen's FB ""HEY FUCKS 4-8 WEEKS MEANS ELECTION"" seem like actions narcissist whose reasoning making decision get re-elected.

It disservice real systemic issues facing minorities make elite group old white people trying actively hurt them.

It makes innocent blame we‚Äôre ‚Äúevil ones‚Äù Take money Heroes Check [Pediatric report Florida](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/pediatric_report_latest.pdf) July 10th comes week.

I posted report July 3rd Time parent friend. stop huge mall use bathroom whole mall shut down. still hundred people moseying around courtyards families didn‚Äôt matter stores closed. sad sight. Well yeah doesn‚Äôt make annoying. Thank you!

Edit: really helpful  years 1918- 1920? looks Spanish flu research... FUCK! punch. fight lives. cynic thinks regardless results, kind vaccine approved late October US. aren't. go Walmart Knoxville get something, even though require masks let people without one, plenty dipshits would get inside take fucking mask off. probably already correct due underreporting. 94K seem unbelievable imagine entire generation growing covid survivors? Heavy fatigue, blood clotting, brain damage list goes on.

This disaster. They're bad. lot seem staying home more, restaurants busy. Salons experiencing cancelations. (I'm industry) 

They packing going north still summer back October/ November.

They mall thing much though.. Holy cow didn‚Äôt realize complete lack support MS has. vaccine works. proven anything COVID yet. Also, Im taking fast-tracked drug. Yeah, they're called morons. you‚Äôre criticizing Fauci put position arguably instructed lie, due incompetence administration? came clean pandemic still happening think China buying ppe Trump notified virus problem? Cool Republicans: No. Also money money money... Puts vaccine manufacturers. Incoming dump!! üìâ First off, confirmed lied. article misinformation?

Second, seem impression options either telling people masks effective lying. tell truth? Masks appear helpful public wear bandanas homemade masks order save medical masks healthcare heroes medical mask supply available. believe states do, happens Arizona says 10k cases fed says 100. 

The CDC 3rd party instance experts. 

From understand easier hide data give corona deniers even use idiocracy. pushing open schools taking adequate precautions, would make sense. They're pushing open without masks social distancing political reasons makes bad people.

(Edit: Specifically referring school board members voted open without masks social distancing, OC parents school districts.) USA support this. let us ruin Canada. makes sense Liberate us, Queen. Texas Florida vying award dumbest moves pandemic?

Place bets. Speedway Disney World? it, Karens Kens I‚Äôm pro life, story? stuff like canceled - theatre, sports, concerts. Makes really easy avoid going out, really. Though, local venue make outdoor stage low capacity went last week felt totally great far away others stuck inside germs, either. smaller countries powerhouses many health officials would refer taking specific line action refer guidelines.*

And countries listened mostly well. countries worst hit coronavirus US Brazil, rejected WHO. Warp speed invested 1 billion oxford. works eventually doses. right.

But, probably, correct next week. well articulating point. mean large part country (many white people) vote based race, racist back racist politicians. people affected racism vote one issue too. Dumbass racism distracts us issues.

I KNOW racism issue, saying wish could put energy elsewhere. surprisingly nothing stupid nationalism. could spam 'murica memes jerk great wearing masks protect other.

It's third us insanely receptive propaganda, whatever foreign countries put money spreading Facebook. lost bro? Huh, well considering zero indication exposure lead long term immunity scientific evidence showing masks slow spread, would THINK would no-brainer decision. Pro Tip: bars town hip enough frequent rotation new unique beers, probably beer store even better rotation new unique beers. Take shit home plague passes. think matter think lockdowns, masks, trump, coronavirus, whatever fuck, cannot really argue Fauci bad guy. wants prevent many deaths possible anyone needs buy high-quality masks cheap, I'm making masks underwear. come three different colors: white, yellow, brown.

I‚Äôd ask medical training remotely relevant education, answer frankly obvious.

And I‚Äôm optimistic vaccines virus much better profiles ‚Äî mRNA-based vaccine lipid nanoparticle adjuvant pretty damn mild. policy place worked, keep working borders stay closed.

that's population US. 8 months (March 2021), would have:

13,284,292 \* 1.02 \^ 240 = 1,539,499,797 cases

USA #1 Well, 2016 called Trump kook, crazy, ‚Äúunfit office‚Äù. Yeah, lot people simply care politics. necessarily support what's going on, care enough start paying attention. way longest time, felt like opinion matter. still feel like I'm one make difference, seeing Trump done, can't sit back ignore anymore, something. DeSantis issued mask order weeks ago, used influence talk get people comply ... might mostly avoided.

But now, may late.  mask order issued today, effective immediately, even everyone complies fully, new patients continue arriving hospitals next weeks. 

I expect lots people dying, state, hospitals capacity care them.

By default, hospitals report detailed information listed daily basis one prescribed methods. However, recognize many states currently collect information hospitals. Therefore, hospitals may relieved reporting directly Federal Government receive written release State stating State collect data hospitals take Federal reporting responsibilities.
For purposes request, hospitals report include critical access hospital, children‚Äôs hospital, general hospital (including acute, trauma, teaching hospital), long term acute care hospital, military hospital, oncology hospital, orthopedic hospital, pediatric long term acute care hospital, psychiatric hospital, rehabilitation hospital, surgical hospital, Veterans Administration hospital, women‚Äôs hospital, women‚Äôs children‚Äôs hospital.


When states permitted provide written release hospitals?

States must first receive written certification ASPR Regional Administrator affirming State established, functioning data reporting stream Federal Government delivering information appropriate daily frequency. States take reporting must provide data, regardless whether seeking immediate Federal document: Watch quickly numbers decline CDC receive data anymore. going watch (fill insult here) go tv smug puss take credit. 0 cases November.

My prediction official numbers only, official numbers something measure. know official positive cases 100,000 yesterday.

Unless one big 5 (FL, CA, TX, GA, AZ) state's contribution US daily number limited. AZ around 20% 16,000 tests day (maybe 3,000 positives day). Mississippi testing 3,000 day, even 25% contributing 700 positives day. testing issue, show eventually.

When kid lonely introverted kinda handy! Hope find least one positive aspect day. hope called one law firms offering explain mask refusers idiots. That‚Äôs clearly type expertise needed here. One thing gain fewer left-leaning voters. Sadly case adults infected died.  Kind entire fucking god damn point. lot times people regular divestment schedules also portfolios managed.  Germany somewhat easy expat in. university get student visa. also offer language learning work visas. I'm sure requirements last two, I'm first option right now. Umm, come crash place? Maybe move in? Clearly guy that's never faced much faint breeze opposition growing up.

He epitome privileged, sheltered, ivory tower bubble-living snowflake. know, everything Real Republicans claim hate? Hiding numbers might easy them, hiding growing pile bodies lot harder.

Then astronomical pile medical debt every hospitalized person doesnt die going accumulate... good luck getting people ignore too.  mean...he said it. It‚Äôs publicly available, it‚Äôs posted sub, etc. It‚Äôs likely combination both. It‚Äôs summer time lot people love go beach, etc. time.. northerners included. Plus, escape get away closed areas south reopened point. Masks enough. live Argentina, we're month 4 lockdown, masks mandatory coronavirus still control. ""neutralizing anti bodies four fold higher recovered patients"" genuinely brought smile face.
Stay safe guys, sending virtual hugs bro-fists we‚Äôre America, duh. *looks many cases are*
 
 **press X doubt** would exactly wrong conclusion reach. response certainly robust see waning titers 4 weeks. vaccine flop hard long term immunity poor keep saying Texans too, left house first time yesterday, everyone wearing masks, someone screamed wearing one putting clothes donation bin(more 30 feet away her)
The irony person yelled nose, everyone else saw (walmart, grocery store, gas station) wearing properly. stupid people charge. Go ahead. Kill kids. least breed stupid people. amount effort administration spends covering COVID could actually fucking something covid. blows fucking mind. actually destroy economy. Weathering first storm hard enough businesses, go second time? can‚Äôt imagine society collapsing horrendous fashion. I'm getting really scared. Every day we're getting worse worse. want nightmare over. four year olds know would delighted told astronauts now.

The message would probably backfire üòÇ confirm ridiculous here. people travel everywhere mask. People still going bars beaches night clubs.  changes high at-risk person corona ""under control"" right states? hospital data routed white house instead CDC, numbers rosy great on. They'll telling pandemic schools open. third country witness covid consequences eyes believe demi-God says otherwise. 42 deaths, 1109 hospitalizations. 

I‚Äôm glad didn‚Äôt open bars up. think that‚Äôs main difference us neighbor states. tradition. set blind system autosells stock preset price point like hits $70 share, auto sells x amount shares. set join company cannot accused insider trading. never morons changes high at-risk person corona ""under control"" right states? could make widespread would great. Turn around time tests ridiculous helping situation US. I‚Äôll pick one park. Gotta get early find seat stands fill t-ball games. joking.... worries bit. seriously, thinking countries fairly well und er control. solved, far better US.

We arent allowed travel countries. But, seem teeming Covid.

Is point rest world decides better drop in?

I doubt it, course, dang. US must look far worse imagine outside. We've never seriously considered expatriates ever ends.

I mean, probably not, far appealing now. Yep. 

Basically, CDC parroting discredited Stanford study rate. one peer-reviewed, scientists called researchers publicly apologize American people one Stanford investigating political bias bad, one financial ties open-up advocates hidden. 

The CDC using rate. rate lower death rate multiple entire places even every single person infected (NY, Lombardy) clearly wrong face. 

The CDC compliant bidding Administration last week, started breaking president multiple fronts. sidelined president. like communist china something. administration's drive restrict accurate information us bad. remindme! 8 weeks Idiocracy would improvement. President Commancho actually sought followed advice intelligent individuals. I‚Äôm willing sacrifice every idiot resists wearing mask. Unfortunately, shit doesn‚Äôt work way. realize CEOs, especially ones merging tech companies, triggers sell stock price hits certain thresholds, right? reality different mine due life choices. I've lived like described without issue decades, know works.  correct, kids, pets, loans. those, choices deal consequences. chose another route. Even medical scares chronic illnesses, monthly expenses low end able save nice emergency fund - no, walk off. I'm set I'm free. Read article. happens entire party puts focus wedge issues imaginary problems.

Anything even slightly real, they're floundering water. would possible. 4-8 takes long get it. NY took like 2 weeks spike 8 weeks come down. know better? assume doctorate science field MD? I'd say that's job. all. opposite, actually. deliberately causing harm.  Everyone? !remindme 8 weeks It‚Äôs allowed several provinces.  don‚Äôt know got information ‚Äúkids super spreaders‚Äù thoughts coming article written professional medical industry well written piece reopen schools should.  dramatic rise hospitalizations South South West logical see large increase deaths. everyone states went Florida stay locked place there? I'm sure things play factor. governor opening businesses saying party time probably something bigger think? Remember yesterday [chinese said [investigation source COVID-19 would exclude Wuhan bioweapons yet. virus going away. That's viruses work. frog wings..... St. Charles essentially spitting image Europeans think think obese Americans waddling away suv big gulp one hand gun other. Elections consequences. So, get fuck vote everybody. 

And, punch anybody like Biden enough vote Trump. shit acceptable last time sure fuck joke lady argument now. Punch way harder they're going vote *for* Trump (or enablers).

Edit: seriously though, keep family, friends, acquaintances accountable November. Ask they're voting starting now, haven't. know people best, shame fuck to. stuff far important polite. bullshit. takes much wearing masks bring thing control. Americans much harmful wearing masks. FFS reopening Disney middle pandemic? LoL

Source: I'm New Zealander revoked citizenship basis terrorism? thought.... absolutely time petty! risking people‚Äôs health lot also anti mask. bad that, higher go hierarchy, strategy becomes ubiquitous. Oh yeah!  $300 dollar AR, sold used, could probably pay 1/5 month's rent! don‚Äôt understand...those errors. They‚Äôre egregiously bad reports. Shouldn‚Äôt someone fired? year first time I‚Äôve ever thought live close border comfort. That‚Äôs optimistic theory, lot people ‚Äú asymptotic‚Äù actually coronavirus t-cells didn‚Äôt symptoms t-cells fought virus. unfortunately probably won‚Äôt know years road everyone‚Äôs focusing antibodies right instead amount population way defend virus right now. flew American Airlines weeks ago

Piece shit.  We've known time child mortality plummeted economic opportunities education become available people fertility rate decreasing would eventually lead steady decreasing world population, related covid? They‚Äôre already lost cause.

The key let people fall trap. Yeah like question ""2+3x5= ?"" That‚Äôs got hit first, latched pretty hard onto pro mask shaming aren‚Äôt. wish funny enough SW meme, isn‚Äôt. bloated orange office done nothing infuriating. bar set lower lower lower lower, fucking reprehensible beyond belief. get accurate picture what's really going US regarding Covid infections/fatalities? really trust federal level charge reporting source information? facts did?

Edit:I'm anti masker. wear one. But! also socially distance, wash sanitize hands. Wearing mask answer. paper mask gets saturated quickly, virus still get through. reduce risk, something contagious coronavirus, steps also need taken. hear anybody defending us work manufacturing grocery stores teachers needs get lazy asses back work teach children quit f****** whining Yeah, that‚Äôs happening. gave America control ago. least live (Pennsylvania), state control. sure rest country aside northeast. Administration Trump says, Trump Putin says, Putin says ""Maximize Chaos"".

Now know things way are. Interesting. I‚Äôm point I‚Äôll start signing waivers stuff . likely pre-existing health issues stem diet, environmental factors, general inferiority health care throughout lives due poverty. need deal bodies try stop people getting sick. die covid full permission blast dead body everything. Grandpa! Duh... subtracted several points score. Bolsonaro first, Trump copying him. Dear Canada,

If keep them, we'll stop trying send Ted Cruz back. hearing much bitching lack free daycare lack education schools closed?  Think long hard...there reason that. People saying wait weeks weeks. I‚Äôm sure people sub actually want deaths start increasing get told moment. It‚Äôs really sad. I‚Äôm also sure many people who, normal non-pandemic circumstances, would busy distracted work desperately need survive would attended protests, could Covid.

I don‚Äôt think motivation reopen peaked protests made leaders realize happen people time care things matter they‚Äôre longer working shitty jobs. 

Imagine much world could change people cared progress actually time energy left work week *anything worthwhile.* Instead, expected work many hours possible little pay possible. Keeping masses enslaved debt and/or low wages ensures never time, energy, means revolt (or make strides change situation better).

At end stressful work week, people even time, energy, motivation left keep current events, much less try anything them. ones energy motivation usually young don‚Äôt means. end week, people want drink, party, relax, forget shitty jobs shitty lives, cycle continues...

If ever time finally realize low wages population control profits, would it. I‚Äôm communist even socialist means pandemic made far understanding ideas ever thought could be. ive worked plenty. also, pretty sure report violations osha wont tell employer reported violation.

ive worked jobs violations called osha come in. one fired. min wage type jobs btw. Brought Carls Jr. know signs vaccine provoking immune response, want right. *Estimate*. 

These **confirmed**. 

And epidemic lasted 19 months. 

So maybe wait another 12 months compare counts. makes sense.

People getting disease nothing funding.

Death rates would tell story better whether medical system getting job done. mean question 100% honesty:

How many deaths allowed leave countries refugees? first state started conversation opening state fighting FL covid cases TX numbers starting go again. Meanwhile insignificant number antimaskers can‚Äôt believe somehow thing. can‚Äôt nice things. reasonable position might take, 30% Americans every time instinctively decry demonize it. Panthers Hornets fan, *FUUUUUUUUUCK YOUUUUUUU BOSTOOOOOOOON*


Edit: please treat Dads better  There's two left intensive care. need 80% effectiveness herd immunity though R0 5?

Masks certainly help, kill case counts. agree. wondered taking crazy pills similar, quite bad, issues school different state. Normal kid things awful behavior, come get early days week. 2 different schools thought maybe serious ADD something. know... smoke lot weed lose brain cells listening people like this

Edit: grammar Draining swamp... Key word ‚Äúeveryone,‚Äù meaning 331 million Americans. never happen ignorant protest masks matter fines laws put place. charge 50,000 year. ‚ÄúBy books‚Äù though, guess sick extortion excusable. Thats big ""IF"" boiii.... Notorious rbg hospital ""possible infection""

If ever time thoughts, prayers, juju, good vibes now. close cali borders, thanks. wrong you?  virus ba sing se. [California never considered ""south"" even south west  American appreciate sentiment, personally would also concerned fuck wits spreading virus trying go country vacation. Hope wherever live, government smart enough mandate quarantine straight block flights U.S.

It sounds morbid country needs implode order people wake up, vote, remove corruption, I'm willing sit house quite months. spike cases started June 16th. month. hit new time high single day new cases June 25th. happened now, ain't happening behalf Ohio: sorry. one best states early curve flattening woman say things insulting governor healthcare workers. Well, claim could walk outside, shoot someone lose voters.

It's thing x 150,000...

Very stable genius.  Worldometers already us almost 900, surprised end hitting 1000 end day sadly. agreement implies US border also closed Canadians. Personally I've got moat filled Candiru, maybe she'd like that? Put lilly pads, waterfall... Soooo...never?  I'm conservative part NY. People call governor ""King Cuomo"".

And yet even people listening Cuomo's orders. Thet may like him, even necessarily agree orders, they'll listen.

That's big difference NY majority country nothing conflicted about.  entire nation needs lockdown get virus back control.  one single scenario justifies risking lives health millions people opening schools less month. Florida already epicenter. RemindMe! 8 weeks think indoors problem? People indoors weeks/months north. I'm confused. mean...yea. fucking complicated.

1. Wear maskin public.

2. Avoid public indoor places peopleare wearing masks.

3. Avoid large gatherings.

4. Washyour hands wear gloves touching things public.

Europe this, Asia this, can't we? De Blasio idiot. Amazing happens protect vulnerable thank pointing obvious. can't say I'd surprised point. teargassed church patrons pastors clear way upside-down Bible (Hail Satan) photo opportunity. pushes blatantly, verifiably false narratives spouts outlandish bullshit constantly -- shit popular deities he's it? Whew ‚Äî thank god partake two things! 4-8 weeks freedom? Lol, thanks /s Like he's afraid going bald, old, pale, short. He's joke.  Sooo lockdown? Absolutely this! Anyone disability auto-immune disease etc. understand doctors can‚Äôt fix everything best times never mind pandemic. understand anyone importance taking precautions. we've known since February inside vs. outside makes considerable difference comes transmission.

Remember Grim Reaper Florida far list need go someone acknowledges outdoor spread protest garnered national attention: Uhlfelder appeared Saturday Night Live, Daily Show CNN, raised thousands dollars, donate Democrats run Congress.

Huh. got mono college slightest clue how. MARRIED, sure hell kissing fellow students. 

Still little annoyed got throwing blood shredded throat none preceding fun. We‚Äôre mostly masked up, seems controlled spread. Also lot people working home. really wish they'd stop reporting maybes, amount nothing. talking roller derby teammate mine see travel games 2022. Super depressing news. mean humans social beings, large, like around people. I'm massive extrovert wait go back office work socialization aspect. 

All power introverts solely work home, can't impossible argue idiots though. Ive tried agree. many things wrong. Yeah mean least guys could get BJs Costco timeline... looks like bacterial related bile duct procedure said justice underwent endoscopic procedure Tuesday afternoon ""clean bile duct stent placed last August.""  justice resting comfortably [stay days receive intravenous antibiotic treatment,"" Arberg said.

I hope uneventful challenging trial? really scary, US never catch virus acting like this. favorite Reddit tradition. Benghazi  Republicans literally argue weren‚Äôt women‚Äôs suffrage democrats would never elected.... Came say this! Hail Lord Gritty. minority feeling everyone wearing mask? last month recall seeing 2-3 people without them. Cherry picking data, [straight-up lying. like think we‚Äôre blind. affect already wear mask public... so... cheers! Big meme im guessing applies rest fucktard countries across world including shitter UK. 

Literally wearing mask could make everything return normal people wont pissing joke Yeah that's gonna happen. badly want carry fly swatter wack non-wearing motherfucker across cheek. 

Can preemptively start bail $$ ""Go Fund Me""? There's side effects medicines vaccines. Stop Debbie downer. Let people hope! really feel optimistic now, didn‚Äôt see perilous studies showing similar results, looks like might light end tunnel. 

Also, know doesn‚Äôt mean immunity, covid-19 turned full lung infecting virus upper respiratory infection, that‚Äôs gigantic win eyes. Well half country equates masks required public communism so... honestly think Americans idea communism socialism is. I'm talking eager collect social security disability checks though. Voting person foreign Californian. levers involved? know we're strangers, heres telling hope nicer day today yesterday, nicer day tomorrow today. Stay safe okay? least dying COVID owned libs!!! Fuck him.

Is way overturn that? Damn that's dangerous. Good. understand motivation still feel bad Last time happened April 3rd, CDC changed position masks, Trump fucked entire planet saying ""I'm going wearing one"". Republican Senators see way. Floyd protests. Like month before.


It makes sense literally rewrite timeline reality. much money talkin? [And farmers spray manure political French protesters play games. That‚Äôs wishful thinking there. Risk hitting someone yep. think correct title be, ‚ÄúU.S. corona virus control 4-8 weeks‚Äù normal circumstances normal people positions power, CDC messaging would created real issues least would resulted minor grumbling.

The administration cheered refused wear mask lead example helping us stop spread mask wearing.

The CDC thing point became cheap justification hide behind fact wearing one obstinate long sensible people would put mask.

At heart this, virus asked better environment work. third rate duelist playing second rate deck. conspiracy theory 101.

Inflammatory unsound foundation. evidence ‚Äúwell could happen‚Äù. place forum people try get information find true issues. Internet arguments pointless. change anyone mind 99.99% time. (Although sometimes they're fun.) face face talks feasible right now, especially types. Best avoid folks best can. It‚Äôs standard side effects anything elicits immune response. Doesn‚Äôt need pathogenic give fever, chills, body aches, etc. Side effects flu shot basically same. extremely extroverted. caved gone anything since February. smoking weed like going style. plus endless parade JRPGS like social connections.  NY? November going important part American history since 2001. month alone determine nation handles issue next years. Don‚Äôt forget that.  Lol dumb asshole realistically we're looking 4-8 months? Every patient taken treated hospital. think couple cases rural areas easily traced. Interesting fucking liars One spouse Canadian. Thailand needs teachers badly, get country job offer school there. domestically transmitted case month. Meanwhile we're confirming 40 every minute here... Uhm...ok? sure relates cool cool UK cut salaries student nurses couple months ago graduated early join fight covid. won‚Äôt even take five years unfortunately. don‚Äôt dismiss theories; I‚Äôm open everything. see makes sense frankly hasn‚Äôt anything that‚Äôs convinced it‚Äôs true, even strong evidence seems like outright open crime isn‚Äôt plausible. sports cancelled, complaints. fine. agree two weeks death toll around 100 day, wrong? Gladys drinking federal kool aid. NSW basically left gates open long. think said anything particularly emotional.

Are favor sending teachers back person schools fall? likely sending many deaths. check Florida's numbers. definitely happening.

 wish stupid made susceptible Covid old immune deficient. hypothetical scenario supposed help country led unhinged mango?  Hm I‚Äôm upstate ny times I‚Äôve went every wearing it. Tho it‚Äôs started decline people started taking less serious ready things get really rough August.

What predicting? \*Genuinely interested\* far  anti mask crowd unstable they'll kill asked wear one? war class war. dregs society, course  sick seeing state plates work commute. Especially Florida please stay home thanks  Yeah, super evil totally China's fault pandemic started.

I mean, like US fudging numbers... Umm. Yeah, it‚Äôs old news.

EDIT: here‚Äôs link. month Meanwhile feels like resiliency training introverted self. feel like could go long time without human contact, I've forced get used months now.

NIH ownership stake suggests particular vaccine candidate PharmaBro 2.0. skepticism well-founded whether vaccine make past phase 3 effective enough, sufficient period time, worth taking.

Thanks bro. notice wearing mask, let break social distancing walk assault you. Fucking trash people. sick go touch him, congrats, increased chances catching it. Get fucked. surprise I'm skeptical Putin much control Trump. definitely believe Putin kind leverage - probably related money laundering piss tape shock me. said, think much likely Trump semi-senile conspiracy theorist. fucked covid response thinks late anything without implicitly admitting fucked up. desperately wants economy back normal thinks open everything it'll bounce back like nothing happened. reality Republicans ideologically committed pass laws need weather crisis we're see mass evictions. Something like 1/3rd US households expected miss rent next month, absolutely staggering number. give like 3-6 months see depression era shanty towns. schools re-open we're going see another huge wave covid. wouldnt surprised see 300-500k dead get vaccine. turned rant I'm fucking pissed. I'm early 30s entered work force worst recession 100 years we're enter something probably worse great depression, happening republicans watch. Meanwhile, rich going scoop dirt cheap real estate, again. I'm saying political upheaval something like soft civil war likely, *lot* likely republicans think. Fucking idiots need read god dammed history book. Political upheavals happen. country that's ever existed lasted forever. BLM protests probably largest countries whole history. Imagine it'll like people start losing homes. we're 3 months end sight. We're tinder box waiting spark. *The Gang Gets Quarantined ][ -- Time Professional* Nothing says affects already wear mask public... so... convince anything anymore. too. grandma way. really sucks They're lying. read safety data here. 45 patients, 1 redness injection site 3 patients 250ug cohort level 3 self resolving systematic issues described fever, body ache, headache. 250ug level used, 100ug level. Texas Florida police don‚Äôt care. Abbott finally mask mandate cops don‚Äôt care. Florida people ‚Äúshut down‚Äù restaurants partying. 


There‚Äôs enforcement. Well ECMO also causes strokes, thrombosis, sanguination, numerous exposures Blood Products, scarring, infection..... ‚Äúcrept up‚Äù mean blatantly allowed happen last 30+ years, yes. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs addressed all. Kids traumatized bizarre new schooling world masks separation bathroom visits metered out. 1000 bizarre new normal school guidelines. Live free die hard. Florida.

Bullshit Somebody tell person dead wrong. much want dead wrong. Thank you, Marvin  I‚Äôve also noticed there‚Äôs kind apathy. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs going long people want forget. 4 8 years then. PORTLAND, Ore. ‚Äî Health officials reported 380 new confirmed presumptive coronavirus cases Oregon Tuesday. also said seven people died virus.

Oregon Health Authority said last time seven people died COVID-19 single day state April 28. seven people died virus 70 older. underlying medical conditions.

These new confirmed presumptive cases bring state's total 12,805. control dumbasses decided protest month straight. Probably added 2-3 months onto shit. adopted dog found much stranger danger separation anxiety within first weeks. travel work kennels Rover part care plan things go back normal.

I offered agency foster found family somehow two months later still found someone. Poor dog missed adoption craze made mistake. know articles aren‚Äôt read scientifically literate people. vaccines pass phase 1 never get approved. issue misplaced optimism clickbait headline. Basically, CDC stopped Trump wants, sidelining CDC, accelerating pandemic.

5 days Director Says Agency Won‚Äôt Revise School Reopening Guidelines ‚Äî Despite Trump CDC changes estimated Infection Fatality Ratio 0.26% 0.65% latest 'Pandemic Planning Scenarios' today........:

The CDC eliminated first recipient local coronavirus It‚Äôs dipshits wear damn mask nose. blame everything. headline also reads U.S. never get coronavirus ‚Äúunder control‚Äù bad show, Wife Swap. Hmm... I‚Äôm gonna doubt bit. think we‚Äôd need shut bit harder (maybe especially places reopening, Florida), also course practice social distancing well much possible. proper N95 masks especially, think 8 weeks may enough.

However, mask I‚Äôve using says it‚Äôs meant block airborne bacteria type stuff... it‚Äôs like basic carpentry mask. So, anyone actually infected needs n95. (Since apparently masks already infected, prevent spreading it) So, that‚Äôs kinda also need distancing stuff, masks. Florida ( live ) teachers‚Äô union far legislature‚Äôs ass haven‚Äôt seen daylight decades. FL conservative shithole through. pushback here, predict. pray it. Hope real luxury days.  already said lied didn‚Äôt want people hoard masks? Newsom closed california again. likely floridians new yorkers went southeast going bring shit back northeast. way control close state borders. literally allowed guns. Fucking take over. ECMO 10,000$ start. need ECMO specialist 24/7 manage machine. Thats additional HCP bedside top RN/RT. Maybe RN/RT ECMO specialist. cant really main care provider run machine.. many needs done every hours catheter surgery yeah fun. Hurt pee days places yes, tap screen choice, pull lever imprint votes onto punch card drop box.

Other places hit confirm vote whatever, paper record Listen want protest pants need know where. Saying that, relatively common people intentionally present information way makes inaccessible already informed subject. experience subject position outside community.

They effort make difficulty people engage discussion. Even going effort determining discussion dismissed using correct language present position.

This prevalent within communities reddit. definitely done bad faith. bad certain group people treated like fucking toddlers can‚Äôt put fucking mask follow simple instructions spread disease. proved exactly means tho lol Another benefit Canadians Americans access healthcare government supporting guys monthly payments. insignificant portion population choice either work menial, non healthcare providing jobs, homeless/starve, support.

But guys done great, that's fantastic! wife quarantined social distancing since March much cats dismay Tampa. It‚Äôs disheartening see many people act like fat old person‚Äôs cancer here, ironically I‚Äôm fat boxer I‚Äôm shamed going gym reacted virus hardly know about. I‚Äôve seen numerous posts elitist tones thoughts saying strong immune system sheep you‚Äôll fine plus gratuitous fatphobia. I, too, tired. wife tired nervous school starts soon USF somehow wants students campus degree. cases spiking people keep partying club hopping. right thing like common sense ain‚Äôt common nowadays. Thank you. Atta boy would able infect others 72 hours felt sick. Funny, think true count seven? No, reddit, I'll get banned. spread oral? I'm biology expert there's many options could spread two men sex think already civil war, declared it. US already 2 million doses ready second approved, mass producing more. come point difficult say articles repost. Billionaires gotten richer since pandemic started. Walmart going fine. local neighborhood specialty retailer probably going under. PPP raid treasury investor class. think read wrong, age group less lethal Flu. 1 death per 3700 infections.  live white liberal area jog walk morning don‚Äôt wear masks. wake avoid it, still bring one case anyone else idea. Asymptomatic presymptomatic people spread virus. good practice treat people positive proven otherwise. he's smart, he'll expose whole thing beginning show actual numbers January attains office. mean grandparents stopped evacuating hurricanes living Florida years, lived middle keys. also stopped paying hurricane insurance. lived 17 years so. house destroyed year sold it. nice T-cell responses protected coronavirus adding herd immunity threshold would expect many antibodies.

Unless we're still underestimating R0, thus necessary threshold herd immunity... I'm glad I'm one sees this. Meanwhile, Florida. 'may be'? sir, 'are' intelligent. mean China? communist country? Lots kids daycare camps etc. they‚Äôve back open awhile based country. Survey Says! literally posted wanting ‚Äúrefute‚Äù article 100 percent accurate. 

I‚Äôm sure original question post changing views based evidence exist time. 

To answer original question, you‚Äôre interested getting people take virus seriously, don‚Äôt engage propaganda, you‚Äôre wanting ‚Äúrefuting‚Äù accurate information. 

These actions caused lack trust. 

The best thing honest. Yes, Florida made mistake exaggerated positivity rate case. Admit it, deal it, talk loudly. 

Don‚Äôt pretend didn‚Äôt happen. believe this? LIVE orange soda.. orange soda! oh wait, lol.. Orange Fanta best! your'e telling there's chance. count it.  I'm placing like 90% problems country right would whatever necessary get power. Yet good enough you? dare say anything remotely bad far left even minor extent. alienate allies. ""After months passed get reinfected certain lower titre."" I'm pretty sure needed initial approval. 

Regarding ADE, able tell initial Phase 3. Also, seen animal models. reason optimism here. Rimming needs duration life cause autism? /s

Seriously, hope works. need good news. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ pot gold bravo. Good Bring visit covid wards. Oh no. precious karma. Whatever without worthless points?

You also keep posting stupid comment bunch different posts. Fuck off. deceptive? son lax brought virus home infect family included 42-year old father higher likelihood severe complications. Even reason son cautious.

The amount obesity, diabetes, pre-diabetes, high blood pressure/hypertension US essentially guarantees aren‚Äôt higher risk absolutely know people are, even conditions aren‚Äôt visible. indeed ‚Äúnormal‚Äù reaction virus loved ones certain conditions; it‚Äôs virus causing pneumonia diabetes. shit!  doesn‚Äôt sound right. Lower testing high positivity rates mean catching smaller portion cases.  What? Neither presented single piece evidence contrary said. attacked individually didn‚Äôt like post. GMO's bad. even go bookstore get one anymore. simply go dictionary.com browser use access reddit.

Too complicated. Ya'll gotta use common words. 

/s app I'm using Apparently Americans still travelling Ireland places. country, Canada, letting Americans who've refused self-isolate despite fact borders supposedly closed. world nothing make sure virus stays USA. yeah, no. think they'd care much would think. get stories, read wonder possible. Especially since live Miami, nothing seems different last month. except every person know, young old, gotten tested least twice. ya maybe r epicenter, Miami Florida , see masks everywhere including cars traffic. Hate Trump, also hate scare tactics media brrrr.money music video! think it‚Äôs similar delayed gratification experiments performed children cookies marshmallows. one wants sit staring cookie rather eat immediately (i.e., wear mask), kids rewarded. able delay instant gratification associated higher SAT scores better life outcome.

Link: bad girl!

I see number people told good girl never got reply. decent percent would said thank you. Ergo bad person. People social distance big pp Pile front White House. think grossly underestimating goes inside ships filled sex starved sailors. aggressive people coming state air profiling license plates, no. Don‚Äôt even need dictionary. google bro! kids tell headache tell drink water first let‚Äôs see feel hydrated.
If continued I‚Äôd ante see mean. Yeah obama deep state infiltrated CDC make trump look bad got downvoted awesome. Could see Craig Ferguson rockin' 'em. Yes extent correct, would still damage control. thats much easier manage smaller numbers. Wouldn‚Äôt agree? Yeah rhems papers written informed voter anything.

it seem like inside info either president would gaming lie - save lives.

He tell truth. stop rationalizing this. comments deleted.

Please explain this. see they've deleted? someone tell comment deleted? deletes them? barely ever delete comment. go back edit them. possible edit appears deleted? comments see old you?

I'm GenX. I'm worried lack common sense many seem missing days... Everyday like Onion article become reality. Big gatherings regular services church seem cause much trouble days. relatively easy monitor impose quarantine measures on. 

On hand, small gatherings Bible study group, church outing, etc. caused many outbreaks. gatherings, people tend ignore social dostancing wear masks. people understand reference? people terminally stupid insane. shit ends civilizations. one cares Pence probably thinks covid sign Jesus returning, different set scary. One way stop virus, least stop bad news virus. think many people spread dying... true, according studies 2022. know many obese diabetics America? think deserves it? It‚Äôs hard abroad elderly parents Georgia, one advanced heart failure. I‚Äôm afraid won‚Äôt able see passes. I‚Äôm hoping asshole politicians get shit together states people start wearing masks quarantining. Sigh. seems like it‚Äôs track match flu 1968. turned anger apathy decided go farewell America tour instead. 

Since hope nation society, might well see cool shit we‚Äôre gone. best comparison would look many people hospitalized, many hospitals already capacity. talking positive tests explaining bigger numbers away wishful dangerous thinking. Seriously, getting enough QUALITY sleep pretty damn important, best sleep 7 - 8 hours night, get bedroom dark posible, dinner 2 hours going bed, avoid looking phone/computer screen least 30 minutes bed (blue light emulates daytime triggers brain wakeful state), mitigate sources noise, put phone plane mode, one disturb middle night, seriously, anything dealt morning; keep good sleep schedule (go bed time every night, preferably midnight, wake every day time); coffee, caffeine pills/energy drinks, fuck brain chemical enviroment really hard ??? Sad. People die ignorance. Ignorance unfortunately, tearing USA one issue time. Real world? Younger population ill, better treatments, hospital capacity starting get iffy. go death rate starts shift significantly due hospitals overrun. regard model design, ML layer SEIR model, so, I'd imagine low mortality lower far.

I swap mine every 2 hours.  Sometime q2 2021 big negative shock. 

When see happen, throw money vanguard total return index stupidly discounted stocks watch money double. Facts dumb. degree stuff. you?

If remove financial costs education, remove barrier admissions. economic models, individual acting rationally pursue education believe *the costs acquiring degree* greater *the increase income attaining degree getting job.* likely case less intelligent productive individuals, going achieve competitive GPAs also run higher risk failing courses dropping out. perceived income benefit lower them. judge costs degree attainment higher income benefit. Ergo, pursue degree. 

If reduce financial costs degree, lower productivity lower intelligence individuals pursue degree. devalue degrees whole, probably increase prestige cost degrees top-tier universities. 

A way circumvent make education free, nationalize higher education centralize admissions. Make purely merit-based. way, degrees still value higher education available want pursue it.

Lol know full well that's said meant, stop making strawmen. scientific literature regarding effectiveness measures, many cases, solid enough warrant measures taken.


Be honest here, even tried ascertain strength research area you? evidence favour mask wearing, here's list SEVENTY studies showing effectiveness masks never evidence.

I ask feels like larger population, actively exchanging virus, getting sick would better environment propagate new mutation.

You especially haven‚Äôt paid attention fact countries states America masks heavily worn, numbers stabilize decline. 

CA doesn‚Äôt negate this. CA destination spot went summer Holiday. CA reopening businesses allowing people patronize gathering places hadn‚Äôt before. Spikes lag 2 weeks actions taken. 
CA full attractions like beaches people like disregard mask mandates social distancing witnessed first hand work risk health. 

What lose wearing mask might possibly save life slightly inconvenience temporarily?

Is doubt lack willingness research personal temporary comfort important shot protecting someone?

This foolish low stakes academic issue doubt debate. time choices real dire consequences others. 

Great you‚Äôre wearing mask. trying dilute obfuscate stakes issue making pandemic equal ordinary times questioning functionality masks real research heavy lifting contributing shitty self absorbed trend trying make personal liberty people‚Äôs lives. 

Nobody suggesting moral question didn‚Äôt exist before. 

But you‚Äôre full shit you‚Äôre continuing pretend situation isn‚Äôt unique putting people especially high risk dying going public. 

Precautions always taken medically vulnerable.

But we‚Äôre dealing easily communicable disease also kill people century. every day extremely novel deadly disease unknown long term effects literally going around easily common cold country.

If mask thing becomes long term cultural institution flu seasons what? already places times illness. doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll wearing mask rest life. end socially pressured wearing mask flu season, cry river. People used complain expected wash hands hospitals new thing.

I‚Äôm putting moral question like many others think it‚Äôs either cute intellectual make situation contrarian debate instead research. Canadians vote US presidents? Wow idea! **Without** widespread mask-wearing, social distancing, partial shutdowns, would wound matter what.

Exactly. crazy seeming impossibility achieve. Sounds like vaccine pretty soon though government also tells wear clothes, rape kill people, steal, etc. neighbors normally quarantine within community went large parties weekend. usually hang quite frequently since none us go anywhere.

After told going parties, said quarantining 2 weeks even though made plans together already. Use hand sanitizer? plan. Thats entire point we're saying. Clippers pair hair shears. Fades High'n'tight pretty easy do. It'll look rough first couple times, get hang quick. know tests consumable, right? Theres limit many possibly done manufacturing constraints. Give Walmart employees danger pay... virus. ship already set sail, time watch burn. 

I mean seriously, public sentiment change course pain felt, everyone. Think anti-vax karens there, say ""I wrong"" someone loved died/almost died. Nothing like reality snap back world. scratch behind ear?  don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs doubt left third US population supports Trumps follows every idiot whim also third US population scientific community like call ‚Äústupid‚Äù. Probably many scientists statisticians. now, though? anyone CDC provide remotely accurate picture pandemic? 71K queue now, right? bad 40% population codependent narcissists charge.  Considering posted subreddit called ""China Flu"", would probably dismiss it. Many people assume highly intelligent people qualitatively different thought process, extraordinary outliers like da Vinci, Gauss, Ramanujan, that's likely true well, there's empirical evidence individuals greater ability notice, reflect upon, consciously direct thinking attention, rather making leaps one else could possibly make.

So highly intelligent people knew school might ""study style"" you, noticed played strengths earlier course education rather receiving quasi-magical ""bolts blue"" (though, again, happen sometimes extraordinary individuals change entire fields inquiry invent new forms artistic expression). Yeah also using resources labs running tests regular citizens running low on. work casino Colorado. We‚Äôve many employees test positive, they‚Äôre trying keep hush don‚Äôt close again... guests elderly. People don‚Äôt wear masks half time, many staters come in... wild Sorry tell pandemic probably going stop civil unrest Understand, logic shows big misunderstanding people die. crass, die pneumonia, probably died due acute respiratory failure sepsis due infection. acute cause death, it‚Äôs reasonable say person died pneumonia.

Since COVID causes systemic reaction across multiple body systems, likely significant contributing factor mortality. It‚Äôs black white thing saying someone died acute respiratory failure somehow discounts caused pneumonia, turn caused COVID infection.

Basically one dies COVID, die acute issues COVID causes. Failed herd immunity strategy Sweden‚Äôs finest new export... scared looks like panic move. illogical.

So par course. wife got tested Sunday morning, called health department said they‚Äôre getting last Wednesday‚Äôs tests.

How long virus survive swabs?
How long analyzing tests sure virus isn‚Äôt dead get false negative?  Bars closed, restaurants ‚Äúlimited capacity‚Äù what‚Äôs actually happening. Wow, that's actually impressive.

I'm also following Oxford vaccine, seems like closer treatment results promising.

\* read farther Oxford Phase III. great get actual good news what's really happening there. Hang there, folks. better times ahead.  Yes. One tenth one sixteenth it, extrapolated another smaller, randomized testing program. mentioned that. Except buy N95s right? regular surgical mask cloth coverings he's talking about. 

There shortage N95s time hospitals (and still are) burning rapidly. fitted correctly offer high level protection virus (99.9%+). 

If everyone gone bought would made even greater shortage healthcare industry could killed nurses/doctors/staff hospitals.

Once deemed supplies able keep reversed course said everyone wear mask protect **others** getting infected. mask wearing around good N95s protecting you, stopping droplets spreading farther reducing number people infect.

It's like even watch clip linked. think probably best call ""Regime"" now, Administration China shit period I'm not. I'm saying people regions SE DK reopened commenting going DK drink.

Otherwise, doesn‚Äôt change much severity outbreak FL. It‚Äôs fodder wing nuts discredit entire system thus claim deaths cases illegitimate. There's actually LOT facilities reporting unusually high rates positive cases, they're small facilities small amount testing. What's deal that? I'm lab scientist theory smaller labs verify positives sources. that's case we're still seeing inflation double-counting may hard prevent may issue long numbers remain small.

Oooo memeber Trump keeps doubling down. seems pathologically incapable admitting mistake.

Turns opening doors diseased impatient, entitled people nation may good! makes sense. wish national lockdown imposed. Yeah, ""defund police"" failed social movement like ""occupy wall street"" call action really clarify achieve desired outcome. 

We historical blindspot social movements entirely just, failed due poor strategy. seem think social movements succeed enough effort goes them, actually need clear goals outcomes otherwise get lots oars pulling hard different directions. opinion circulated bulge bracket equity research departments lol.

You correct saying talk advisor redditor, you‚Äôre plugged markets beyond BS day trading quite things concerned over. kinda suck I'm jogging get sweaty goes mask makes leagues harder breathe. I'm guilty nose thing, there's people around. since April. thought policy already nationwide? Damn far behind response... Andora, San Marino, look like disaster zones per/capita stats. Belgium seemed terrible time trying control spread, waited long.
Instead saving lives though, governments trying save businesses, bars, restaurants, hotels, malls, cost many many lives more. list countries meant cover every possible country. Yeah, even wrote it, felt weird phrasing way I'm religious since generic term, figured ""what's harm?"". Guess expected anti-religion phanatic jump throat it. 
Thank well wishes though. I'm spending time quarantine sewing masks least feel productive. Yep. Although think know exactly they‚Äôre doing.  covid compared gunshot.

An applicable example would covid die gunshot still listed covid death. people trust also seen covid deaths inflated. Anders Tegnell (Swedens state epidemiologist) understood asymptomatic / presymptomatic transmission. ""Wash hands stay home sick"" simply enough. 

Unless aim herd immunity is.

The mishandling pandemic disgrace Swedish authorities. 
We sparsly populated country single households world hard hit early pandemic could done better.

Unless herd immunity still is. first days super high fever, cough, trouble breathing, felt like going die.

Then fever finally broke cough fatigue continues linger. time move around even steps triggers massive coughing fit. even coughed hard pulled stomach muscle. know supposed two weeks three weeks cough fatigue still here, like hours, sleep lay hours, repeat over.

Seeing doctor struggle, go ER see anyone urgent care even let building. doctors space suit checked three weeks in, still covid positive nothing life threatening. coughing misery.

Meanwhile I've run sick time PTO short term disability I'm draining savings however much longer damn thing lingers. Work let back I'm clear also let work home. ahahahahahaa! Shocking... Rhode Island here: get lot press great testing since least Jul 3, people reporting 10+day wait times drive CVS nasal swab tests üò£ Maybe hard get people trust you‚Äôre 180¬∞ flip flops common sense.

The term ""flip flop"" seriously poisoned people's minds. flip flop change opinion guidance based evidence. understand, got evidence, understand. hard follow. [The US apparently working hard beating terrible corona giving based guess work. Look SK. extremely thorough testing 2.1% CFR. going say IFR quarter eliminated community spread catching cases? people born Swedish, choose it, become Swedish accidentally. think anything 24h unacceptable. supposed go work waiting week test result negative? Sounds like Nazgul. said I‚Äôd get vaccine passes clinical trials low behold many people called stupid sheep Trump Admin always assume malicious intent stupidity.  Yup looks like totally United. get approved numbers side effects. Get ready Karen's fight...shooting arguing people since nostrils showing Wrong. Byeeeeeee\~ Please wait til winter, ya'll. think bad now? ain't seen nothing yet. America first! reason top people live sub really think intelligent people world. would depend entirely are, investment portfolio statement investments currently look like.

I work buyside firm specific buying strategies.

If give general advice, would say look SPY call options price falls 300 level go VTI (vanguard total return index). long take long term investment view. 

Getting fancy times like takes lot expertise people already invested S&amp;t 500 stocks currently. Individual stocks dangerous, index funds really measuring direction. Returns lower, you‚Äôre much likely correct. Fucking hell, good luck fellow Americans 8 weeks September 8. Schools session. Even well-controlled, mask-wearing areas K-12 schools going mix remaining pockets undiscovered infection everyone else. Colleges opening campuses excruciating regulations money spent assure parents safe, policies protocols fragile, sidestepped state student transmits elevator wall gets another student lives campus. many easy ways go horribly wrong. soon numbers start going White House think see big change. Hospitals still full people die paper look good. side-effect not, definition, always better actually catching it? agree this. constantly mystified technology climate allows one simply press hold word unknown get definition, remains thing. braindead? literally saying Cubans pass white White eyes white republican americans. Cuban tell look nothing like Celia Cruz neither family save father grandfather afro traits phenotype. personally olive toned skin dark hair can't really pass white, plenty us can. entire point attack based misreading misunderstanding saying. Also funny tell Cuban-American idea he's talking reference Cubans. born grew Miami, first language Spanish (with heavy Cuban accent), everyone know associate Cuban. hard pressed find someone better describe Cuban diaspora. literally past, present, future, daily life. Schools opening here, time. think kids staff wear masks general population classrooms students/staff special education departments NOT. don‚Äôt see possibly social distance literature I‚Äôve seen, doesn‚Äôt look like going to. first time life, i‚Äôm ok school-aged child. guess, comparison, Norway, Denmark, Germany others mild enough ride feel confident enough open Sweden. or, tenor article, ""100,000 people would donned mask later subsequently died"" forget hard work put Russia! Sweden worse shortage Norway currently due severe strain placed HCWs mismanagement pandmeic. 

But yes, Norway deifnitely stop hiring Swedish people train workers residents (and following Swedish model letting foreign HCWs easily go work would good, Nordics probably (Not sure Finland, DK also makes hard immigrants HC degrees work)). Thanks friend. guess next step change that‚Äôs needed. rough. got back though! Check check herd immunity strategy Sweden. Never been. Never said like everything america comes takes thinking them. Saratoga SARS? got hazard pay? know estimates current yet, weeks ago prediction true case number close 10x higher recorded. that's true, we're hitting 600,000K day. I'm sure seems reasonable, regardless definitely higher we're counting absurd. [Last week: 44 florida Shit, hospitals barely function full. Let alone full chunk staff COVID. Feel super bad working bedside right now. anyone honestly say ""plan"" begin with? Trump golfing every week get conflicting info whenever tweets. seriously handling pandemic, first thing honest. feel like WH even States treating nothing PR problem.

The plan falling apart since root problem US politically based. changes reality, science based approach first, Americans hard time recovering. going reopen schools. there's data everything fine. Trump Admin going erase traces COVID present country convince people kids fine schools reopen 100% one needs wear mask.

I feel like I'm living alternate reality. Easiest way keep numbers down!

‚ÄúLook great we‚Äôre new cases!‚Äù ‚ÄúWaaaaayyyyyy early end pandemic!‚Äù Yeah thanks Walmart, thanks four months later.

And usual fuck refuse wear mask. think quarantine, spread it... walmarts area mandatory months Tariffs Canada stupid. pay workers US, cheaper.

Tariffs Mexico, alright. Canada? Completely pointless. get point, looking detail cases?

All cases assumed covid deaths even clear causes making numbers innaccurate.

You always give examples taljing cases there. data feds using say worst FL? Finally lack social interaction paying üëç Constantly locating articles dead people parroting line preexisting conditions isn‚Äôt normal reaction virus. It‚Äôs called lack empathy it‚Äôs personality disorder. Inform yourself. decisions lack vaccine confirmed vaccine take longer year. 1-2 years social distancing small price pay prevent whole generation deaths health conditions.

Yes, adult small price. toddler, sacrificing 1-2 years actually incredibly huge price pay comes developing social language skills life.

Finding group parents trust people trying do, massive risk everyone involved. get sick, others say, ""well kept child locked away 2 years."" People choosing high chance mental problems life, unknown... ranges absolutely nothing permanent brain grandparents ran multiple war-time economies rationing, think handle this.

I'd rather derail convo much kind address it, considering times. go romanticizing older generations...

Rationing forced upon them, like Americans rationed greater good. 23 years *second* war majority even allowed minority legally participate many parts society. Great grandparents generation fought WW1 would considered citizens 7 years later simply born here. Others even allowed leave reservations.

Also, resistance masks nonsense happened spanish flu well. Inb4 ‚ÄúFauci didn‚Äôt kill himself‚Äù first thought well. Yeah stores sold basically anything health care related months now. groups facebook broadcast second anything stock snatched within hour. lot people , probably recover functioning back, alot wont, I'm talking top-tier athletes can't afford capacity lungs functioning.  Federal Government plans. problem leadership like plans outlined. Every state following plan Federal level withhold funding states comply. result handful states following CDC guidelines lot states whatever hell want.


Its crazy think honestly believe election year response would much different. Dude, fudge numbers can't hide truth No, Trump irreparably damaged anything.

The GOP machine soldiers thanks terrifyingly effective combination propaganda, money, sociopathy, greed, ignorance+selfishness+self-importance (on part voters).

Even probably never face consequences myriad crimes manage go whole life without ever tasting accountability thanks inherited wealth advantages conferred upon result.

At worst GOP gets blown one election retool ground game ramp propaganda, obstructionism, whataboutism yet another step.

The way changes people sit home voting get fuck vote. GOP also making sure that's difficult possible. know way irreparably harmed voter participation increases stays higher. Yeah I've checking stay sold out, people area cleaning shelves time stuff comes stock. may found decent one Target 2 day shipping ill probably order it. China never right Holy shit! 39 posts dumbass sub. Fucking hell, new content would great! Absolutely agreed. Testing abysmal actual cases per day likely awhile. positivity rate already awful shaping get worse. meant that, increasing spread, still increase confirmed cases even without increased testing.

Unfortunately it‚Äôs easy dismiss estimated unconfirmed positives (at least virus becomes ‚Äúmysteriously‚Äù lethal üôÑ). kind people want schools person, Disney open, can‚Äôt breathe cotton kind people see 20% positive think ‚Äògee whiz... we‚Äôre testing 80% people need to‚Äô. appears second time people get it, get much sicker.

Antibody dependent enhancement? nightmare... good news 2/3 florida children New normal, spike... see ""international"" right.... ? 

You understand implication? science works. go information time, theorize it, alter learn more.

In beginning, scientists believed virus heavily spread physical contact. That's beginning, ""wash hands, touch face.""

Then learned virus actually worked - spread aerosol droplets - , switched ""social distance wear mask.""

Anyone alive AIDS epidemic 80s saw well. started ""don't drink glass use toilet someone AIDS"". figured actually caused spread AIDS became ""don't unprotected sex share needles."" read study tho? 

How link posted, Google search erodes public's faith journalism whole.

I think part problem every article written online written journalist (some even written people) link showing automatically bless article true, worthwhile, correct.

Most information questionable best reasons rest reddit questionable - anyone submit link time little oversight. saw report bunch early adopters model 3s programming ""updated"" limit capabilities car buy expensive version. 

The car perfectly able better acceleration, better mileage single charge features... programming intentionally hamstrung vehicle pay unlock ""features."" 

And features could re-locked forced pay get remotely (which happened early adopters model 3). 

Then consider dealerships shops work car anywhere convenient inevitably breaks... 

I never Tesla.  I'll get electric car reputable established brand. shit. It‚Äôs point could actually true statement. None people believe freedom get virus. 
If can, need stay home 3 4 weeks, one allow go party. go super market, must wear mask fine $1000 dollars get lot federal funding surprised WH retaliated ignored edict. Still could send imagine. Also point, really extra important states collect data share citizens local media directly. think way get local truths, maybe national media likes John's Hopkins real center national info.  provided 2 examples disproving claim cases rising due mask wearing.

I asked example disproves claim herd immunity. Bro, haven‚Äôt real vacation years, every time save enough something comes important can‚Äôt justify putting money ‚Äúbuy house one day‚Äù account. don‚Äôt understand people can‚Äôt go year without vacation. cells way precludes antibodies. doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúimmune‚Äù, increases rate adaptive response point never become symptomatic. Review roll cells stimulating B cell response. 

I don‚Äôt mean single out, you‚Äôre means worst offender I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôm getting sick armchair biochemists trying weigh real information. Right. child would one interact parents teen, like much. would spent room alone reading watching tv. main social thing going dance school. Without that, would nothing. I've seen folks local Nextdoor ranting masks. One guy claimed scientists actually agree, placebo. countered links Mayo Clinic Johns Hopkins explained masks help stop spread virus. anti-masker replied, Mayo J-H actually agree placebo, makes us feel better.

The guy also said masks reduce oxygen intake acceptable levels. Someone countered link American Lung Association, advocacy masks.

Another person cited friend, cardiologist, anti-mask. one doctor believe masks worthwhile, took mean friend speaks entire medical community.

Another person explicitly cited Dr Fauci untrustworthy, suggested hidden agenda. IIRC, person lumped Bill Gates argument well!

That thread got heated pretty quickly ultimately deleted.

In general, lots people rant violation freedoms. say, laws prohibit drunk driving? woeful limitation personal liberties? seat belt laws? illegal pull fire alarm yell ""fire!"" fire exists? violation first amendment rights?!

Maybe laws ban smoking public places good analogy. wife used work American Cancer Society, time, one big pushes, get smoking bans place. backlash intense places.

In general, think ugly selfishness permeates lot American culture. many people equate ""freedoms"" notion whatever want, regardless affects others. feels like common courtesy basic human decency rapidly eroding. reduced arguing think believe. I'm pretty sure that's prejudice.

I'm fully aware (most likely our) privilege. great privilege enjoy part world direct result values personal agency individual liberty, thus especially important protect attack.

Yea that's basically saying. We'll know true numbers news media going ferret numbers report them.

It true, course, everyone paying attention. kind deception can't work long. Instead, country aided Italy china, go bad point Italians lowering EU flag raising PRC one instead That‚Äôs fair valid, wish wasn‚Äôt like this.

Even 25% significantly lower 40% Moderna vaccine, link show even 25% get fever. 

Moreover, even though vaccine seems safer Moderna one, STILL recommended anyone 59 years old (according link). 

And that's that's despite Yellow Fever deadly COVID-19. 

So end, think link shows think shows. article links paywalled copy paper. also find paper (""Working memory capacity predicts individual differences social-distancing compliance COVID-19 pandemic United States"") searching title Google Scholar, however. recommend reading it. Neg Covid Test But!!!

Never think Darlene Conner would one day one create vaccine may possibly save entire planet am. never understand comments it‚Äôs far I‚Äôve experienced rural area! went taught small schools rural parts Iowa perception intelligence highly desirable.

Mind boggling 2020 we're siege Trumpism.  Cluuutch.

DRG based predicted length stay typical costs take care patients. hospitals get reimbursed nursing care, PPE, respiratory therapy, etc. course getting paid take care covid patients, can‚Äôt free. amount appears high, expensive patients take care severity problems. would surprised making amount money patients. 

Hospitals make majority money elective procedures/surgeries/cardiac interventions. cancelled lot hospitals room covid patients. Look anywhere online - hospitals hemorrhaging money. would minimize covid numbers meant could surgeries. see hospitals sending people home covid save room deathly ill. 


Anyone pushing money narrative either feeding false narrative understand medical billing. 


btw death rates lower testing people, younger people getting diagnosed, getting better treating people. problem people this, people spread higher risk people get sicker and/or die. continues hospitals overwhelmed death rates skyrocket. 

This bad, really bad time got corona, job living someone. thousands others. 

That stop virus. 

This article 100% bullshit pseudo-science. tho lol    required wear correctly apparently *incoherent screeching /r/nonewnormal* Prepare yourself... insane customer videos coming.

WOW point, testing reserved hospital patients health care workers. Anyone else symptoms quarantine 14 days.


This New York many states early days pandemic. However, literally ability perform several thousand tests day across entire country. perform hundreds thousands tests today unless get virus spread control quickly going reach physical limits testing. getting downvoted reality. 100000 deaths statistics, loved one . one wishes subreddit masks freakouts? 41% MIT's graduate student body (main research resource) would banned this. raging pandemic. freakers get shot back? What's normal reaction virus then? Even majority regular flu like symptoms, plenty people without comorbidities long term health implications even died result.

Inform yourself, way target here. times million. Living Canada example de-facto better stability. emotions get way. OK someone's mom grandpa die they're old, high blood pressure? need pay rent too.

[Wait, That's interesting take Thanks! pretty much exactly info needed see. need isolate matter test/what results come back. would probably buy less junk delivery curbside pickup. Hmmm... think u nailed problem head 

Testing point contact tracing. u millions infections it‚Äôs kinda pointless ur everyday interactions. 

Assume everyone around u if. Assume u well. best u can. 

Physical distancing ur wearing ppe kinda overrated. u gotta disciplined weigh risk benefits every action guess  Ok, live plantation? Isnt thing slavery times? Sorry, im Europe I'd given platinum coin.
Thank this. Really. exact feeling ""there's actual hope"" that's main source depression worry lately.

Facts met sheer ignorance conspiracy theories. like people took ""think yourself"" ""media bullshit"" mentalities, went completely overboard beyond point stupidity. much time spend hospital? home quarantining? Idk, maybe don‚Äôt touch mask you‚Äôll save lot time. grocery store work at(HEB) week ago. can't say shit wear one local police enforce customers know it. provide customers mask one hope wear it. mean that's paradox enact quarantine measures mask mandates disease spread. they're effective people say well infection rate low. here. Im one work, wearing day. unfortunate part hiring security lot reactionary morons believe shit anti-maskers. liability man. Somebody slips falls due water floor Walmart pay 6 figures lawsuit. That's common occurrence Walmart executives keenly aware type risk. 

Imagine somebody could prove got Covid Walmart. show Walmart knew risk customers address they're almost certain win huge judgement. Walmart show they're going beyond keep people safe, much less likely they'll lose. Maybe things changed, last checked Walmart payed extremely well _for retail_. People like knock peg Walmart (and should) pay based success, yet ignore fact working Walmart better retail, especially smaller shops.

Maybe things changed last 20 years, though. Thank Spoiler alert. state mandatory mask rule Walmart require abide mandate. mean anything. two weeks so.  Ah yes white walkers December school tried make us sign one. Flat says acknowledge covid19 contagious, deadly, likely exposed school results illness, injury, death us family member they‚Äôre held responsible. union backing us signing. doesn‚Äôt tell know it‚Äôs safe idk what‚Äôs wrong you. best think covid would bit deadly asain Hong Kong flu end this. near Spanish flu plauge guys three months progress, late June, guys... seemingly... gave up? 

What happened? doesn't, least me. use DuckDuckGo. there's kind LOT this. love service places use overly fancy title make job sound important is. guess owe ""It's flu"" people apology. live Asian city 5 million people. We've 27 covid deaths... Since January. Thorough contact tracing mandatory quarantine protocols, place since January. Makes ya think could happened America voted people take science seriously. told sick laughing worries.

I'd told working healthcare understand basic COVID information. Let lies begin. doesn't. Thanks info, helped narrow look well. also asked PCP confirmed well. Thanks! 100% states control.

I'm worried something causing need seek medical care able receive it.  No. one work doesn‚Äôt neither one place. Holy shit FL big though? think even obnoxious anti-mask idiots, overwhelming majority going slink away shit guy that's like 6'4"" 270 pounds telling wear mask leave. nothing storm front Nazis price freedom suppose. problem they'd truly free actually wore damn masks. Idiots. Use cases two weeks ago probably. Using today's cases lag still caught deaths going greatly skew numbers. honest, see people Walmart wearing masks typically affluent stores.  bet arrest parents sign keep kids home. Probably violating school attendance rules. States also borders. I‚Äôm sorry. shitty mom feed way. Tell send big hug. Honestly, year's vote might really life death. make sure complete costs. really thing still feel nation. Much thought would go away September. evident great money give away. control number people inside building. They're counting who's going out. building reaches max capacity many people stop people entering customers exited. one entrance makes lot tougher control.   I've seeing look way even say anything one's entering without mask area illegal one month now. doubt enforce places.  Ah thanks. could remember tend forget lot past. remember panic everyone kinda gone. even seemed bad Southpark made easy going joke native americans rubbed chinese people blankets infect residents Southpark. made seem cold.

And read immunity would MAYBE never possible virus mutates like mad.

A lot people think wind carrying virus away, happen, main thing outdoors much space virus disperse to. indoors, droplet concentration people talking (or maybe even breathing) would keep building reach infectious dose concentration. Outdoors, float away (unless someone's spray zone) become less risky. Imagine stuck guy always peeing. stuck hot tub, bad. stuck river, bad. Well it‚Äôs going come right back states flattened curve already. Typical selfish people. Head back states please. Take em back shoot em. That‚Äôs deal no-maskers. Also might see decrease social security contributions eliminate enough idiots.  end freedom!  ^^/s did. picked decent electric hair trimmer online (&lt;$60Cdn), wife shaved head 12mm long (about 1/2 inch) back June. balding anyways, sides back getting messy, top started look like bad comb over.

My head warm wear hat sun, nice breeze cools much quicker, never worry paying hair cuts again.  couple months ago went pet store sign front saying employees considered high risk customers must wear masks. problem since wear mask everywhere, walked single employee wearing mask!! Like least set good example customers also you‚Äôre probably endangering ones high risk customers?? Karen's everywhere Need ship hundred overflow cases hospitals nearest large city.

Good luck Walmart, cause wont go well think Union : Walmart :: Voldemort : Wizards would help job situation fuck ton Walmart hired security, especially companies normally events since almost clients right now. 

Grocery stores Canada hired ton employees really quickly walk around sanitize shelves freezer doors. dudes dudettes walking around spray bottles cloths non-stop cleaning. lot people able get jobs that, best paying, stable, wonders people needed job / money get by.

Walmart went SC sign front saying mask mandatory dumb ass employees nose dozen fat ass older women wearing masks roaming stores anyway.  


This publicity get enforced well, employees give shit enforcing rule really paid enough it. think ""Masks work"" ""Masks bad you"" arguments real reason want wear them. Instead, used justifications to. 

Those people legitimately thinking (if honest themselves) want wear mask work. real reason like them. I've explaining anyone listen. Lee going kill residents TN blink eye, blame poor it. /u/PandaBearGuyHunter Thank much: 7/2 symptoms suspected/detected, 7/7 first test (self-administered nasal swab CVS); second test hospital 13th.

*First Teacher Flight*

I still laugh it, years ago. Sad thing is, funny. pay police lot overtime. people, especially mask protesters ""it's hoax!"" people, make difference. need vent.  wife symptoms told Dr self quarentine untill get tests results back. employer employer said expect us come work untill confirmation. Like...this one reasons US bad covid19. know anything anything? Yes Japan little restrictive measures, barely tasted all, contact tracing center disease control. yes death rate pretty damn low, simply know. 0.1% nations lucked out...? Maybe, nobody really knows death rate low. 

Wow. intelligent sounding you. ""Yes Japan didnt shut didnt many deaths .. argblahblahbadoomboom!""

Point - Japan didnt shut didnt many deaths. didnt ""Covid nightmare"" happen countries didnt shut suffered almost economic damage neighbors death rate that's roof, look up.

Sweden's ""Through roof"" death rate ""549 per million"". reduces ""5.5 per 10,000"".

There time year could conversation would think ""6 deaths per ten thousand people"" anything described ""through roof"".

Do game? army 10,000 6 soldier died, would describe casualties? ""Through roof""?

Yes Sweden screwed seniors, many countries.

Imagine .. Sweden simply care workers wear protective gear beginning, death numbers would fraction are, would nothing really criticize. Ignoring absolutely faulty logic here, trying say social distancing important. Thanks! gotta take moist filters see wet I'm Fairfax seen single maskless person nearest grocery store. Also stand around outside black suit right sounds like hell.  South hadn‚Äôt yet experienced large outbreaks like Northeast, many Southern states cities reopened bars gyms early didn‚Äôt require people wear masks practice social distancing ‚Äúthat seriously,‚Äù Redfield said. virus introduced areas, could allowed spread quickly.

I sort get he's saying. sounds like he's saying is, re-opened absolutely vacationers showed up, might okay shape (and re-open ""too early""). think kind BS re-opening invites travelers, function re-opening early vacationers showed up. parent would sign something like deserves lose custody. No, care circumstances are. I'd face homelessness signing document allowing someone expose child something potentially lethal. Yes. cannot cite ""common sense"" source claims scientific studies. ""Common sense says quantum entanglement nonsense"".  getting tested destination getting negative result mean stop quarantine? I'm Canada unless get exemption (under review several provinces) observe 14 day period isolation matter status. study found people lower cognitive ability find social distancing mask wearing difficult comprehend ,

It actually struggle process information act mother works one employees goes: First time mask, write up. Second time mask, termination. Quebec 4% temporary covid pay raise. covid unit, make 8% need direct exposure covid clients. Everyone makes fun basically 20$ per pay R.N. deductions everything. Government negotiations union offering 5% increase 3 years less inflation. public say we're essential keep saying we're guardian angels society deserve best. infuriating. breaking news, new study shows water still wet, also fire hot. Really cost efficient, Arizona. 

If could bill hours ReOpeners. Yall really gotta start actually reading articles.. proper attire? course aren‚Äôt! never do! people think they‚Äôre perfect everyone else problem. bet never leave mom‚Äôs basement. get it, actually think social distancing important. Yeah left year half ago. share mindset, way would stayed this. Congrats office, sounds like great position. Trump friend contracted COVID died April - local part man? go bathroom whenever need whether like not. see lunatics raging southern states rural areas. Good Walmart enact this, there's going unruly customers bound make news go viral *Do hear Karens sing?*

*Equals ‚Äòbigly‚Äô brain*

*There scene start*

*When required masks come!* proven ***both parties*** wear masks spread reduced something like 5%. We've also seen Asian countries control spread everyone wearing masks. know works doesn't. 

Why still discussion see happens countries locked down, practiced social distancing, wore masks along vs countries people still arguing effectiveness masks? appreciate things much again. I‚Äôm inclined agree, it‚Äôs also fun mock Americans‚Äô staunchly capitalistic approach governing economics Great happening little late ball guys. place months ago. overwhelming discussion white privilege involved face mask debate. use term ""Karens"" (meant denote upset white woman) gets thrown around often topic. wanted make clear stupidity exist within one race. white man, married Latina, I'm really tired much anger directed towards white privilege. wife choice words women Spanish. Without exceptions nobody would listen anyways. Noone county even food workers. simple truth nobody enforcing people care. think Republicans trying nonchalantly distance Trump keep Senate. would require Fox News' help. 

If they've already decided Trump lost, need start taking virus seriously keep conservative voters recognize threat coronavirus. stupid mandate mask? It‚Äôs simple way help mitigate risk fact. problem wearing mask? Exactly. they're coming around blows fucking mind... took 4months mean, making joke‚Ä¶ yeah Well shit bed die hill, shit simply roll away. run small business can‚Äôt go call customers it‚Äôs brutal watching cash flow collapse sucker punch read. Well put, unfortunately. today Trump toast. blogs COVID-19 immunity vaccine research usually get posted r/COVID19. don‚Äôt think anything prevent spread kids still cough, pick noses, etc. I‚Äôve one disinfectant chambers go bar months ago don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything novelty. argument stay home order illegal argument Governor legal authority extend past certain number days seeking approval state house senate.

DJKhaled.gif ..and would also show US ain't great I've started grabbing extra disinfectant, hand sanitizer, first aid, gloves/masks. I'll also grab extra non-perishables even though S.O. hates stocking pantry it. look fall even worse before. Thinking further, remember reading bats China multiple strains coronavirus. (less noticeable less lethal) strains spread region historically could contribute people affected areas high prevalence immunity Covid help (one many factors) explain drastically lower rates infection.

Further, conclusions bear out. really good sign development effective vaccine. work Microsoft, make decent pay, okay. Thanks heads though, I'll save advance. Honestly lots places I'd like see Europe. think official Darwin awards, endangering lives disqualifies you. hire Bar security since jobless rn original SARS actually self-limiting deadly, read contagious carrier symptomatic.  hiring ""health ambassadors"" enforce mask mandate. many countries account deaths correctly. Canada example, corrected death Ontario patient Covid determined factor death. weeks that, patient died heart conditions tested death assigned Covid. foreign celebrities running around LA yelling people's faces without mask, peep criticism them. yes I'm sure ""karen"" that's problem. go walmart get vaccine pharmacy. Shits circus. Americans afraid masks? never said virus active look Germanys 7 day moving average cases throughout May June major surge cases consistently getting well 1,000 cases day. Ofcourse small areas outbreaks. US massive surge cases nationwide US getting well 50k+ cases day well original peak 30k day. mention several states like Florida seeing 10k cases day. End day facts show Germany never major outbreak covid cases like US peak done much better job keeping cases consistently low since easing lockdown. US done appalling job. Germany seeing surge cases April schools closed Karma virus heading way. Covid new tv programming scarce. best reality show ever.  Every business they're smart knows this. Like videos people higher end supermarkets vons/Smith's necessarily ""higher end"" Walmart but.. let's real, are. Lol.. expect take seriously Labor Day.

We lockdown workplace stayed open despite essential way. company started producing shitty masks shipping facilities excuse stay open case. 

My local grocery store started mandating masks last week, 4 months pandemic. workplace mandated masks ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù ended don‚Äôt enforce it. They‚Äôre going listen nobody like lol tried nothing we‚Äôre ideas I'm sorry going thing, happy someone confused am. üíú

CDC could still analysis public data. know, man. definitely feels inside.

When protests started, recording ""sympathizing"" people, Coronavirus creating hard times.

I'm sure legal component it, too. I'm sure they're weighing sorts monetary possibilities. 

I know cops even called local Walmarts face covering violations, customers removed refused service. I'm American Montreal now.

Yeah yeah, another stock pump dump.. wake there's 60 mil doses going vulnerable pops.. There's many things wrong this.

Too many guns hands many entitled idiots provoked many shameless propaganda channels let alone many years. Consumer spending simply rebound without country vaccinated. 

Let‚Äôs stop back forth, we‚Äôll see right 6 months year. debate. Every intelligent person known hundreds years. would anyone take seriously? guessing one does, good reason.

""The order requires businesses take reasonable steps, practicable, encourage mask use employees customers. One example reasonable step might post signs encouraging customers patrons wear mask. Although business required deny entry people mask-less, always retain right so‚Äîand would certainly reasonable step encourage mask use.""

So wearing mask ""religious"" reasons, service. understand enforcing another story starting somewhere.

If Alabama it, Florida Georgia governors excuse follow. stocks year... find funny one guys trying get people wear masks.. wearing correctly. Coronavirus *is* father! Russia almost certainly playing sides other. trick they've used (successfully) since first set culture wars 60s. know China astroturfs site propaganda primative culturally ignorant, Russian stuff far subtle.

Tell one side flu governments using excuse create dictatorship. Tell side airborne ebola we're going die.

Get everyone believe half country trying kill everyone, they're evil must destroyed leaders must brought means necessary.

And people spent last four years complaining Russian interference likely fall lot. deaths reported last week [backlogged deaths 4 weeks seem like recent deaths started increasing yet Haha heard one before, love it. live Georgia, term fits lot people perfectly Cannot wait see hits ‚Äú‚ÄòMerica‚Äù community. Good, last several times went got looked like crazy person wearing mask. avoiding shopping Well, enough morons well. Many many people vacationing right now. wait become worse. mean apparent since I‚Äôm one wearing mask. don‚Äôt understand everyone‚Äôs rationale here? We‚Äôve working entire pandemic maybe they‚Äôre comfortability showing? too, pay attention, maybe ignore news? people still able shop Walmart without mask till now?

America really crazy. Found next overwatch name Monday? ""now""?   continue spike ball ‚Äî publicity good publicity. mofo goes prison otherwise confined, they‚Äôll continue cover him. great me. home since second week March.   
Eventually bring us getting tested. don‚Äôt think could permanently work home things need on-site things normal - think able work home occasionally without big deal. tidbits Shit Sherlock News, children hard explain quantum physics to, dogs like tennis balls, trees smell like wood. There‚Äôs still many emperor trump loyalists. could say hates USA would STILL VOTE man. mean really hard thing It‚Äôs crazy makes news. live Romania went lockdown soon around 100 cases. Schools shut immediately, non-essential businesses moved online possible. We‚Äôve reopened last month (and significant rise cases) it‚Äôs still completely mandatory everyone wear mask indoors regardless where, long it‚Äôs public space (restaurant/grocery store/mall/etc). least Bucharest. didn‚Äôt make news, didn‚Äôt need announce ‚Äúthis needed‚Äù. Lockdown lifted, long stores complied allowing anyone without mask. Plus, restaurants moved terrace; go go toilet (or order self-service) even then, need mask able go in. yet cases still rising long people aren‚Äôt socially distancing. wonder US majorly fucked. isn‚Äôt political issue, wearing mask doesn‚Äôt need statement political side. cause there‚Äôs global pandemic. Exit bubble second.

ETA: You‚Äôre required wear one outdoors here,
in case hadn‚Äôt made clear. that‚Äôs probably one reasons cases rising; people don‚Äôt wear mask outdoors. again, mandatory indoors. questions asked. wanna go in? respect others enough keep mouth germs pandemic. Simple. Thanks sharing perspective. I'm sorry .... I'd expect much peers. made comment. want know *why* oppose lockdown measures much. keep going like circles. 

I'm asking reframe anything, want know why. Exactly why. Better shit often still shit That's exact problem virus. kill many since spreads easily. much flu sitting close 0.6-0.8%. higher chance kill vulnerable ppl. becomes ""other ppls"" problem ppl. solution personally telling co-workers think others. don't, can't anything.

I called Saturday free test free testing weekend wait Monday. (I think tried weekday could get test day) made appointment 2PM. Driving literally quicker 50% time go fast food drive thru. paper got said I'd get results within 48 hours they'd call positive, logged next morning saw results posted midnight (10 hours took test) put points *Science Denying* Skill triple? Wow, stay America. Monday July 20th? I'll get shopping done walmart turns adult tantrum center say ? Swede? Russian? Chinese? Walmart get bunch veterans security advertise veterans dare fucking anti-mask people question patriotism. nightmare scenario. 

My guess potentially setting emergency hospital inland, transporting patients covid isolation treatment.

Intubated patients exactly known stability moved especially they‚Äôre proned.... 

I pray doesn‚Äôt happen That's area congested entrance.

They either open entrances less people go one entrance. make one entrance one exit there's room people much easier practice social distancing.

It's even annoying entering people wearing masks. Sorry bad news. googled 88 username plenty front page regarding use 88 good.

I bring see reddit LOT wondering there's white supremacists identifiers signaling en masse without called it. go quarantined sections reddit see lot.

Stormfront white nationalist, white supremacist, antisemitic, Holocaust-denialist, neo-Nazi Internet forum got shut down. 

It's deniable enough fact see around often concerning. Hopefully mundane dog whistle. understand frustration, want results,

/u/seunosewa got results: cousin longer coming possibly infect at-risk family. Seems forgot urgent need keep cousin away. Thems results. Could possible someone specific strain covid 19 catch another strain covid already sick?, true separate ICU patients test person covid strain effort/experiment decrease mortality rate? attended protests though...  cognitive dissonance going strong among anti-maskers. They‚Äôre told it‚Äôs hoax bad health, etc. Wal-Mart forcing hand president wearing mask, do? Thanks link. reusable N95 mask sell disposable?

Appreciate help :) Pandemic cases millions rising 60,000 everyday

No leadership co-ordinated national effort crush spread

Massive political division 

A corrupt government supporting anyone 1%

40 million unemployed rising rapidly 

Unemployment running July around 20 million.

Millions losing healthcare 

The last 4 months rent mortgages due end month. 

It‚Äôs perfect storm idea didn‚Äôt get tested have. 100% 48% got tested turn negative still significant. appreciate that. felt nervous saying wouldnt fare well r/politics (where I‚Äôm banned life), it‚Äôs true. Dems work little guy, innocent this. see progressive front next years parties splinter. you‚Äôre trying provide biased flawed data try prove point. many many friends Sweden Denmark say (in unison) output smear 10 times receive... 

It shame really. Failed strategy ague.. also feel equal mix concern fascination... live bumfuck arizona, good ol‚Äô boys came armed intimidate peaceful blm protestors. cant WAIT see picketing walmart this. can't believe US countries manages this. 

I thought private hospitals, interest get numbers out.

Who paying treatment sick? 

Where money come from?

If getting money people, obligation inform them. many US contribute? It‚Äôs Quebec recoveries need 2 negative tests believe. There‚Äôs likely lots people recovered never go negative tests. Ontario 2 weeks since episode date hospital. free debate Sweden? looking debate people agreeing you? 

You also know post history goes way back week 21 anyone bothers check paid ""close attention"" Sweden long that. 

It also funny many articles SVT/SR posted point things could done better considering ""state run media like SVT SR still pretty 'toe line'"". folks concerned erosion rights

The concept ""rights"" cleanly cut discussing something everyone must comply deal threat. case deadly virus spreading, solution everyone wears cloth mask, really hill people wanting die on? (pun intended) ain't one gonna tell wear mask they'll wear one becuase? Less careful? Please explain. going enforce this? I'm pretty sure mask policy we've seen countless videos Karens Kyles barging anyways.

And even cashier chooses ring up, could go self-checkout. going stop no-mask people? going buff security guards bouncers toss out? (actually would good entertainment). Letting everyone mothers mouth breathe onto everything politely recommending please wear mask stop killing people germs Mask enforcement brought Black Panthers. school (TN) isn‚Äôt even officially open yet (will two weeks), half building got shut case. According shitty plan, supposed shut school 3 days guess don‚Äôt care.  
There lots kids extracurricular activities none wearing masks. Even department heads aren‚Äôt wearing them. mention fact countries figured already. like need invent new technology. fine it‚Äôs fair, people deserved catch refused wear mask, social distance etc.

It‚Äôs sad see people everything right get sick. LOL tweet response OP‚Äòs linked *Walmart lost India‚Äôs right behind probably happen.* support Walmart's decision someone going die due confrontation masks whether staff member, police officer, armed anti-masker. concrete evidence China deliberately hide numbers? Ur misinformation big insult Chinese people made much sacrifice pandemic. Talk cheap, show ur evidence .  I've watched self hair cuts youtube videos (can't believe never thought this) i'm inspired learn cut hair dont rely anyone. 

this would save much money. Bumpty, bumpty, bump! Less Coronavirus interpret scientific results. facts study regard situation, circumstances, population in/on study done. Therefore, conclusions study relevant initially situation circumstances.

The opposition thread taking study setting conclusion ""Coronavirus spread low schoolchildren re-opening schools safe"" applying directly US. order make sure we're talking apples apples, answer questions. questions, we're trying determine conclusion study applicable given school system comparable size US.

* situations comparable enough?
  * many students compared schools?
  * much time spend using schoolwide shared resources (like computer labs playground equipment)?
  * practicing social distancing?
  * masks required (and/or provided)?
  * students, families, teachers self-quarantining soon find they've contact virus?
  * household measures quarantining infected individuals same?
  * compared communities experiencing similar infection rates?
  * communities enforcing similar safety protocols prevent surges fluctuations infection rate?

There's probably things, I'm trying draw conclusions here. Maybe study really applicable people whiners. maybe study differs enough local region applicable.

To clarify, study applicable kind like able admit evidence case ""schools reopening sooner later person teaching"". like court, able admit something evidence make wrong, makes valid logic stepping stone use make case.

So, bringing around, perfectly valid say ""I follow science, study shown well conducted, contest applicability study situation hand"". rebut saying either passively ""Can show believe study apply"" go offensive say ""Here factors come show situation study comparable enough situation""''

Hope helps!  Lol enough people infected already? Wtf? nothing covid denialism. far fewer casual/impromptu conversations bounce ideas people work remote. Thats fact. businesses asking everyone keep Zoom meetings open big chunks day conversation occurs.  Everybody, keeping pandemic going. 

A disease affects person. pandemic infects population. 

When someone follow guidelines, two things happen:

1) risk infection disease 

2) interfere effort get pandemic control.

If morons going around yelling ""hoax"" ""but muh freedumb"" ""but 1% death, that's mostly disposable old people going die anyway"" we'd actually reopening real now, pretend reopening that's going fail choice never ""close close"" ""close purpose slow pandemic"" ""close days later many people sick/dead can't keep things open."" 

So fake-reopening. Yeah, plan. milestones re-opening. Nobody hit milestones, people tired situation politicians said ""go ahead."" 

We re-closing. Maybe back plan, maybe many people sick keep things open. statues guy people like stand racism instead confederate figures. Trump saying cases would one day disappear like miracle. Poor leadership Federal government state governors. Lots divide going political parties right tons finger pointing going still denial Pandemic real is. also election year re-election unfortunately focus president right now. get much part read ton reddit watch news.

My opinion end day really lack leadership ability execute. like already tank economy examples countries handle pandemic response. Oh boy. That‚Äôs going go like lead balloon, judging quality Walmart shoppers  !RemindMe 4 weeks Wait, American stores? God bless I'm Europe. swear entire union movement prevent shit 100 years ago, it‚Äôs slowly stripped teeth allowing feudalism return. long since passed time difference Trump voters people ""a difference political opinion"" He‚Äôs mini Trump. political experience, businessman...and sucks leader. even hired private school proponent commissioner education like Trump! got banned two weeks sub talking Trump. pandemic political, fearless leader made so. really could time unity country...if real leader.  embarrassing you, OP asking specifically Canada. Every problem nail hammer really wish executive branch didn‚Äôt power interfere federal organizations NEVER partisan. Along march fascism .. hope ends soon  There‚Äôs 2 picture maybe 5? assume you‚Äôre referring open nose lady front guy wearing half-face respirator getting benefit proper seal beard. knowing doesn‚Äôt make go away... Thanks. gave results right away able tell world much labor goes one tests justifies $1500 price tag.  least wearing masks. Given population density, need God addition science glad least setting good example basics. Mostly flailing around impotently No. posted bylaw misinterpreted.

The police anything 

Seeing plenty options need picked up.or delivered valid excuse. funny sounds, thats actually common contractual stipulation meaning situation outside anyone's control. said said would prove claim intensive care every country

Make educated guess. Hint: stands, claim intensive care world wrong. rudeness intended- watch Fox News? think reporting biased all? genuinely curious.  serology study released: Conclusions: Less 1% British Columbians infected SARS-CoV-2 first-wave mitigation measures relaxed May 2020 LOL. It‚Äôs like Darwin action. Good guy!!!! may lost career, public service career blooming!!! Harsh reality Boris died, Tories would‚Äôve treated like martyr Hire bar bouncers patrol stores. ""Hi Karen. Where's mask?"" Same! happens, go comment history click ""good news"" part. fixes imagine Taiwan perpetually degree readiness invasion, meaning population willing comply sacrifice greater good.

South Korea similar, though probably lesser degree.

Less overt complaining muh phreedumz. Ironically given people freedom go today‚Äôs pandemic world. worked retail Best Buy. 

never again. 

my heart goes guys. That‚Äôs scary dystopian shit. People choosing ignore reality front face. Truth definitely painful, better acknowledge accept reality is, adjust, humans (who survive) done history, continue living illusory magical land never really existed begin (except mind). Peeps could use good dose meditation. probably are. noticed bring fucking want to. lots dudes molon labe gasden masks ARs shopping now. great. sucks. understand people Upstate NY pro Trump. St. Lawrence County Franklin counties two poorest state. say democrats look them, many towns basically run down, full drugs job opportunities. probably pass 15-20 homes pro-trump paraphernalia yards walking dog, buy every day jys obvious GOP politicians give crap them. Controlling every part market boomers lose retirement even screws every generation. taking others even one yet 

which could also say hamburger. minor sins, like mentioned. slightly wrong, world resources egregiously unfairly distributed. [The US 676,000 tests wants ramp almost 2 million day. MLB wants 2,000. top 10 list injustices. 

To take others, first establish shortage. Hard [the US tests knows with, actual title article, lol, 

___

""While places spikes infections‚Äîlike Arizona‚Äîare facing shortages, large swaths country actually reporting underutilized availability.""  

""And yet, Washington Post found, state like Utah running third 9,000 tests could run every day."" 

""In California, Governor Gavin Newsom admitted state could test 100,000 people day using 40% capacity.""

The Phoenix mayor asked feds help, FEMA finally answered. Probably help Democrat WH politicizing... [Backlogs AZ already 35% July 9th. (second last tab, green 

There long lines UT today, MLB could pop station donate reagents labs pare lines wished. Utah's problem seem capacity, apparently Utah 9,000 tests day. Looks like Mormons cheap me. 

Cant tell behind iron curtain college student seattle (j/k, lol) humans hoard wealth shit. big problem... poor example. wit, doubt US double testing capacity September. would pretty hard MLB hoarding critical amount unscalable commodity. 

All im saying is... save rage. way important fish fry, imho. Like mask usage. godssake people, putting mask go would reduce trickle. care think ugly steams glasses, prove saves lives fucking already. work Whole Foods confirmed case store. informed going get tested told could work day test didn‚Äôt symptoms. wasn‚Äôt forced it, also use PTO time missed. Luckily live city rapid tests got results hours. posted bylaw. Interpret like matter. I‚Äôm Florida, went Walmart yesterday, half customers didn‚Äôt masks on. It‚Äôs joke man.  Glad visiting days Hard agree that. I'm assuming government going wanted would happened March, Instead wanted add 3 trillion Fed's balance sheet buy ETFs support ""market liquidity"". fucking gross. JPOW bragging ability digitally print trillions dollars free bailing people. gross behavior. 

I agree online learning great used vast majority students. I'm talking students severe disabilities, children age 8, kids unable care parents away. point options either pay parents stay home take care children, reopen schools. unreasonable tell parents longer expected child care services, also shutting day cares (because would close schools leave open overcrowded day cares???), paying take care children. That's actually win situation parent.

Or maybe people wear masks. knows.

edit: personally, knowledge anything viruses spread whatever, guy finds threads r/all wears mask, think schools would fucking disaster. Bail people UC San Diego Health super fast, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre nearby. go get tested morning, get results early evening. Pretty sure even trying hold accountable previous attempt. McConnell never let happen, half country screamed waste time light previously, what's point now? could say fucking dire, change outcome McConnell gone.

No one person able hold entire ransom way Turtle McFuckstain has. people act like ""profits lives"" new American policy. American government really banks people short-term memories. good sir wooshed Yep.. lol.. new friend spreads around non paywall this? anyone surprised this? Ok, that's pretty good. aren‚Äôt unless people wear masks social distance. We‚Äôre concerned material self gain personal consumerism care everyone else. logic capitalism playing within society, community, understanding tacit apparent cooperation everyone allows society function. ideological apparatus economic system rooted collective identity everyone‚Äôs minds result. Religion American pretty much abandoned cowardly superstitious factions point.

The days bible stories could viewed helpful allegories turn spiritual support gone. 

Now NoAh's ArK ReAlLy HaPpEnEd! ~grabs popcorn gif~ American definitely feel ashamed country. patriotism time low. better time open schools... agree points. Working kitchen life big eye opener me, broke [college student](http://www.quickmeme.com/p/3w25vt). I‚Äôve told bad attitude towards money. hate spending it, hate influence people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Florida....of course. Oh boo fucking hoo. ever survive world entilted white women called Karen, horror! private businesses Toronto refusing people entry masks? certainly refuse entry people health reasons. posted proof. You‚Äôre missing main outcome proved children weren‚Äôt spreading virus high rate, even communities outbreaks. outcome showed cases reach relatively low rate schools re-open. guys arguing semantics much please lightsn keeo stressors try enjoy day fellas   Nope would guess... well going go well  buckle yall reddits feast Walmart safer schools, never thought I'd see day. I'd love see research one way aisles effective. I'm suspecting not. 

It seems like end walking twice many aisles way causes congestion. Plus half people ignore one way aisles anyway (and miss sometimes get confusing) end passing people going way anyway, even people *are* going way frequently stopped pass regardless. 

I suspect one things (knowingly not) makes people *feel* like they're something really much. I'd love see actual data though. friend TN test positive, says hurts like hell, I'm waiting family test positive. mask, health insurance, two obese nearly diabetic, one history heart ""incidents"" (this calls mild heart attacks he's had).

I want 2020 ride. Scotland(soon England well) compulsory wear mask shop, people work shops dont to. got I'm really happy see this. nationwide chains need implement mask policy help make substantial progress we've failed miserably federal level.

I also really hope Walmart corporate something employees supported this, cuz yeah, Karen channel 24/7 starting Monday.

Yeah gonna suck while, right thing do. Watch court hearings fren, powerful. Fauci admits reason NEVER explains didn‚Äôt promote homemade face coverings! 

That doesn‚Äôt make lot sense considering every place simply requiring face covering 20 year doctor says it‚Äôs useless!!! seriously gotta ask, come ""temperature tantrums"" yourself? amazing lowly retail slave store question OP, I'm sure I'll use lot. Yeah employers aren‚Äôt following it. assume true many others. great part don‚Äôt wear church businesses aren‚Äôt affected isn‚Äôt consistent company‚Äôs established safety plan.

Essentially business employees mandate. Can't also send photos people local police departments? Maybe Wal Mart even invest getting enough cameras cover parking lots?   I‚Äôm gonna sitting next dude trying sell rap CD parking lot watch shit go down. New material r/publicfreakouts fo‚Äô sure.  astonishing me. Austria masks mandatory since pretty much beginning. resulted in, least county, 1000 - 0 Infections 2 months. Yep. Read Walmart butchers anymore.   employer following health department/govt recommends. Since area refuses accept severity situation, keep pushing return date back 2 weeks time date gets closer. employer decides returning office, isn‚Äôt anything it. way continue working home feel sick test positive. 

It personal judgment, people really isn‚Äôt. employer wants us back office (I guess monitor us? I‚Äôm sure) soon possible, health damned.  went Walmart yesterday. signs saying people required wear masks.

1/4 people masks on. people did, 50-60% around chins noses covered.

Don't shop Wal Mart unless want catch Covid. Straight up, going able enforce mask thing. realize comments add nothing discussion got downvoted? People risk can't lock society. never made sense. Many live congregate settings still need go pharmacy, supermarket, essential job, etc.  purpose dissuade people getting tests keeping numbers low Unfortunately, cannot enforced America unless it‚Äôs state federally mandated. anyone say wearing mask gives anxiety. still try force leave, they‚Äôre discriminating mental health issue. know sounds ridiculous, it‚Äôs true. Unfortunately, definitely people using excuse. No, I've heard [nobody knows 19 came mean, feel bad people Fla, let's honest, they've voted best interests decades, so... Damn, well face mask Tuesday guess can't use one.  Walmart n Canada? [A lot cases artificially doubt even understand title honestly. going go well Walmart's demographics. Expect lot videos coming days grown adults temper tantrums Walmart this. ......everydays new record. Late March, studies old. Yeah smart people jumped social distancing right away considering information available time.

Unfortunately rushed reopenings help economy much. vast majority people going participate pre-COVID feel safe. Reopening early without proper precautions making economic human toll pandemic worse.

Maybe 30%-40% population willing partially participate according recent statistics, near enough keep businesses open people employed. people directly know someone hospitalized dying COVID, would expect numbers get Yeah, make f\*\*\*g employees wear face masks make wear noses white house wants control numbers Let‚Äôs hope relies public healthcare figures worst.

There mandate place here, part Dekalb County within city Atlanta. simply....doing right thing

edit: realized Walmart forcing masks actually impact huge percent population shopping anywhere else. Especially small towns Walmart already chased away small Business

This massive good, Walmart employees. Even late. I'll take it!

We aint playing here. *Ice grills fucking Florida* can‚Äôt test people fast think, there‚Äôs lots people getting tested limited tests Suffering horrible federal leadership issue thanks big angry orange one call president. go Walmart Florida Saturday, though masks already required Florida may wrong that. someone stationed door masks hand sanitizer looking phone, asking anyone wear mask. Less half people, including employees, wearing masks. Please wear mask. really small sacrifice make much potential good. Things could back nearly normal 6 weeks could get 100% mask compliance. indoors, already higher risk. stands, risk COVID change much mask. Especially cloth mask. I'm saying wear mask. understand masks silver bullet virus. Yeah...I'm holding breath. fucking time. Should‚Äôve seen Walmart city. 10% customers wearing masks. woman with, kid not, 6 kids walked leaving, none wearing masks. Just...what fuck? Can‚Äôt wait go troll people bitching it. Oh, like Trump. Build wall stop drugs, coming border crossing. BLM violent rioters? Cut Idaho rest country. said. said, ignorant person comment. circles Germany? Wait Dollar General caves, honestly, redneck mecca caved, rest too. wearing mask properly, nose uncovered

Ahhhh, old dick-nose trick. didn‚Äôt go Walmart Monday I‚Äôm clear Ive say times people airplanes (I'm flight attendant) pull stupid fake cards. medical reasons able wear mask would involve already hospital. ONE exception severe burn. 

Its sad sometimes use countries fucked healthcare weapon, prior corona whenever someone said stuff like NEEDED put first class support broken leg/heart condition/whatever make big stupid scene must extreme medical condition calling ambulance ground (which want pay for). works almost always even though super dumb entire plane knows I'm making scene. I've started masks i.e. asking trouble breathing, ""oh take seriously per company policy (not actually lie)"" etc. know money embarrassment causes put masks back on, whatever. betting man, would definitely put money back March first governor get it. anti-vax arguments 

Every single anti-vaxxer know anti-masker. Nothing immune criticism. You‚Äôre Reddit know now. problem matter protest happens, people issue convenience pragmatism. plenty examples people fighting masks social distancing sake fighting. deserve criticism. bring group fighting racial injustice using article way demeaning cause racist paired commenter‚Äôs general disdain races. thought D.C... Well hospital room. Local newspaper posted this. People commenting going boycott Walmart now. One friends commented, yeah like everyone said would Walmart killed many small business. 

I laughed. already rule beyond contagious day 26 what? Actual quote article:

‚ÄúDr. Colleen Bridger, interim director Metropolitan Health District assistant city manager, said plan place hospitals ask refrigerated trucks hold bodies longer fit morgues. said trucks already use area facilities, specify many used.

Dr. Bryan Alsip, University Health System, said hospitals don‚Äôt large morgues, refrigerated trucks needed handle overflow bodies. said University Hospital might need trucks.‚Äù

Your post title totally misleading.

Edit: downvoting me, please let know wrong Rush dead right folks, typical flu season fill morgues July. Let‚Äôs honest, fucking doubt employee going force this. It‚Äôs insane incompetence retail stores actually protect customers.  Wife nurse. told me. know. San Antonio Texas think?

Yet. reason start tests, tho.  Oh god. going go well turd punch bowl.... They're requiring, enforcing (and that's police officer entrance). omniscient omnipresent God know I‚Äôm can‚Äôt see face? I'm shocked get earlier. Walmart Dallas already signs front. Wedding get Zero enforcement keeping inside. amount people wearing one chin completely insane. Prove it.

Agreed. said, there's skepticism there's justified skepticism. try hold ideas tentatively (tentatively true false) take personally find wrong.

The number people claim ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù wear mask significant...the thing disgusting nasty breath. ""may"" ?  I'm shocked get earlier. inflation (as traditionally defined) really happening.

The problem Fed changed definition ""traditional inflation"" means years, imo, make everything seem kosher. 

And I'll agree based Fed currently defines inflation, inflation hit main street yet. right we're essentially playing musical chairs then. music stop eventually, everyone left without seat fucked, i.e anyone rich. minimal sin...

 Get popcorn out, y'all! Something involving head orifice. Exactly this. Posted several times NY + Euro countries enacted strict lockdowns hit five figures. every one (NY, Italy, Spain well France UK around total) roughly levels following ten days. Florida third population countries, numbers horrifying.

Florida basically ignored lessons, took little mitigating actions all. numerous accounts people Florida saying mask wearing 50/50 De Santis commited reopening schools, could yet get worse. Scientifically proven well. four months least italy since started shopping wearing masks, glad picked up. boys make POTUS resign. finished sure wonder similarities Brazil USA. Could fucking idiots Presidents? Coronavirus agrees... Karenheit 911 What, now?? german, required wear mask since end april go shopping anywhere üòê news, 

Governor Ron DeathSentence also tells Captain Titanic going full speed iceberg zone safe.

Governor Ron DeathSentence also tells people hydrogen filled zeppelin, Hindenburg, safe. Thanks!! No. taking comment basic face value possible.

In society, obviously always going boss someone listen occasionally 'take orders from.'

I'm talking mindless drones bother think eat what's fed media, Facebook moms know scientists, conspiracy theorists zero facts backing up. issue THAT. People zero brains *of own*.

You're kind part problem. read things face value immediately form personal facts, opinions. Instead asking specific clarification, immediately jump gun think know *exactly* meant. believe completely understand stance things. People like dangerous large groups tend gather you, whatever say large numbers becomes ""truth."" people wear pants outside no? freedom? wearing seatbelt? protests that? ""no shoes/no shirt/no service"" policies throughout country? Please work! certain point, they‚Äôre going get worn comply. thing happened seat belts. Idiots underlying ideology, don‚Äôt think whatever want. watched videos today, idea bad. least country live makes effort wear mask, wash hands isolate. 
We need wash hands wear mask every shop, even dropping daughter school wash hands gate wear mask !! Karen‚Äôs already released [official üòû 3 months late good them. Sir, America offence, spanish flu infected 33% world, death rate 5-10%. 

I mean potential hit raw numbers Spanish Flu quite deadly, percentage wise. Covid death rate sub 1% (even CDC put back 0.68%). spanish fly killed somewhere 17-50 million infecting 500 million people.

However I'm commenting based headline article thirty second wikipedia search, maybe I'm missing something want businesses stay open, mask up. Kinda takes breath away, either way. mine, go break, comes mask, everyone breathing everyone else. nobody's social distancing. guess think catch spread clocked in. kind expect management caution sense danger customer back quickly, can't picture corporate trying protect us.  It‚Äôs based pragmatism. Look people, overlook *other* things, importantly don‚Äôt rat out. shut didn‚Äôt change mind asked name would kill 130k+ Americans year addition everything typically occurs Covid weren‚Äôt around Wow took three replies get fact majority us super computer pockets answer questions. much intelligence. Walmarts near requiring face masks months. Practically retail stores been, surprised news. Keeping loved one phone/video chat team come speak may help. Good luck take care! I‚Äôve noticed several states making quarantine soon enter, exactly would help anything? 

Do understand quarantine is? means stay house two weeks go anywhere. course going help brought virus outside state, know whether go store interact another human being. it, go business. Working neighborhood grocery store, Walmart, I'm thankful Pritzker made masks mandatory stores Illinois. feel much less anxious working everyone taking precaution.

Especially people sneak behind bump global pandemic. Sweden gambling virus going away without vaccine. Therefore restrictions designed maintained long time, years necessary, without causing much stress fatigue among citizens. We're seeing places like Melbourne, Florida California happens first go strict lockdown try reopen, even though nothing really changed since March. pressing Pause virus months. There's lot unemployed bar bouncers. MAGA cult going go crazy this. get here? Astonishing.

Are going sing Hotel California? spikes longer. levels sustained they're plateaus increasing curves. 

a spike implies sudden increase decrease sudden increase new baseline level. Honestly think confused dont know talking about. *"" ‚ÄúThis joke. deadly devastating disease affecting millions people across world,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúYou need listen understand you‚Äôve got take necessary precautions. wear mask, least wear mask, try wash hands often can.

I'm tired hearing, ""We everything right except (insert high risk behavior), got it. careful, serious""

The time careful yesterday, today, tomorrow; tragedy strikes. **never** kept stupidity themselves, though. vote presidential elections unfair share power Electoral College. stupidity gave us Trump. Correction: UPSTATE New Yorkers. true. I'm 6 foot 3 white blue eyed male 230lbs tattoos younger white supremacists come talk bus thinking one them. good reason looks, I've apprehensive clippers suppose long go full bic razor would fine Interesting thing is, masks helped black plague... think spread virus-infected lice, rather air. I'm online teachings. Many teachers school curriculum unqualified. online teachers public facing open courses, keep toes. extra teachers job, assistant teachers local school district. 

There's many middle school kids still can't spell many high schoolers can't calculate basic math. 

It's qualified taught principles 50 years ago. History teachers know history. Maps heavily skewed. 

Teach us tax high school. Teach us basics farming. starter packs.

But know why, purposely set us find job, fill role, dependent system. 

Bless America!!! cover noses? think stores already require shoes shirt service, understand people comply. Finally America start get thing control What, part Mafia now? 

Try get life without killing somebody. kek, sure bro, sure is...

I agree Sweden cases tho, contrary US (that least things) literally nothing. Yeah, fox affiliate went thousands labs reporting test results Florida found smaller ones made mistakes. total, makes virtually difference remove them. Then, affiliate published article written like bait maskholes rest history. Florida saw 100 reported deaths today. deaths infections 4 - 6 weeks ago.

When get crushed weeks insane numbers getting now, Governor change tune. late. 

Sad.  Ron great job honest, totally 100% mother's fault. kicked son house moment son want follow rules. house, rules. 

A friend mine kicked TEEN daughter family house went party pandemic. Sh\*\* move? Yeah, maybe. alternative would death entire household justified. 

I really hope mom finds way live guilt actions (or inactions case) killed husband. Well I'm wearing pants then. study say? highly doubt read either lol  Kevin Stitt, guy That's feasible. people single parents - really options situation. Park front grocery stores remind people wear masks. comes karens doo da doo da, come karens... it‚Äôs alright da dara da dara da dara da... Continue avoiding Walmart. Yeah ok. Fauci CDC TV literally saying masks harm good still blame idiots. God forbid hold people elevated scientific authorities kind standard. can‚Äôt believe hoarding justification here. government shut 80% businesses demand masks pulled shelves home depot. got mine 25 minutes local clinic Tennessee...

I'm one people go different Walmarts several times week service items them. Third party merchandiser, welcome this. Finally. wear one 8 hours, bad asthma hauling items around stock stupid trading cards stuff like that.. wear 30 minutes. go ""social-shop"" wear 3 hours. look forward seeing people freakout walk told wear mask, though. [Looks like Cain still hospital covid attending thing... Ben Shapiro comment I've ever fucking read RNC nomination party goes well....otherwise sure Trumps Ego could take it....then he'll take guy begged move RNC state.... Yes. Yes is. thought bury vacuum sealed bag. easy us smart enough use website.  pretty much rules anti-maskers. Read [Derek Lowe's blog depth analysis. Wisconsin take seriously, hence us one lowest total deaths. Although back rising case numbers along majority United States unfortunately. Also Menards WI require wear mask Uruguay small, educated population. politically stable country smaller degree polarization, probably non failed democracy Latin America. also better healthcare system, better welfare policies on. comparable country probably Costa Rica, also well fighting pandemic. Went three Walmart last week Florida. security door closed gate open let in.

Then walked past manager mask yelling someone end store so... Yknow. ""So said people, 'slow testing down, please'"" understand logic, believe that's play out. That's really proof virus literally eradicated. That's slippery slope positive result end. There's nothing guaranteeing influenza B would literally eradicated.

My beef saying masks would good wear. beef claiming complete *eradication*, since that's word originally used. specific meaning shown study saying would happen. Lol good luck. Muh rights! Muh freedumb! course. They're banking DeSantis rational thought. take bet. American living London. point numbers U.K. misleading people aren‚Äôt tested rate US right now. People aren‚Äôt wearing masks either though change 10 days seems. [He sure did. WalMart employees wear masks  Yeah amazing many people last week saying that. every couple weeks.  


Late May: ""We've open month nothing changed!"" 


June: ""Cases rising, hospitalizations aren't! guys bunch doomers!"" 


early-July: ""Hospitalizations rising, deaths falling! explain that!???"" 


Now: crickets 


These people get it. facts virus dont change. Nothing different April. Hospitalizations always lag cases weeks deaths lag several weeks more. young people getting mean it'll less deadly. overall death rate may fall, daily deaths going continue rising people change behavior daily case growth falls. shitty home cooked meal beers worth risking entire family‚Äôs life. Good you. know hard right now, making right call. Mhm. I'm ready entertained Hooray!! Oklahoma showing awesome are!!! First Gov nation get it!! Saw happening local Walmart day. masks door customer without one picked up, put on, walked in. 

If POTUS refuses lead, maybe Walmart will.

Lead, Follow, Get Way.

\#Resign live Ohio well think it‚Äôs 2nd shutdown. DeWine might fumbled middle this, he‚Äôs likely listen science GOP governors he‚Äôs also seen data. We‚Äôre Texas Florida 2 3 weeks completely spiraled terms positivity rate. hope he‚Äôs proactive shuts shit keep getting control. that‚Äôs ideal announcement, though I‚Äôll also take schools staying closed state mask mandate. People complain long test results take... try little careful take care ourselves? product society government always trying save people even make terrible personal decisions? That's crux entire shitshow. People believe ""individualism"" ""freedom"" mandates, say people mask want to. times call collectivism, like battling pandemic, time need strong leadership. Right now, USA *weak* leadership. Maybe walmart invest money security kicks let anyone without mask. dumb ass country 9 mil population hire security shops it, idk walmart leaders Europe did. Plenty choose from. leaders South Korea did. hard figure out.     
         
Do expect people take time explain spesifics using crayons?  
Likely give shit want cavil whatever said.  
  
If really curious can't figure yourself, google it, easily obtainable information. act helpless. invent anything. already control lot places. Learn them, act like them. top fact article says manually type everything whereas CDC direct access hospital‚Äôs data hospitals didn‚Äôt anything extra. even numbers reported slowed way due staff manually enter it. worry going forward testing distribution resulting info collected federal administration. see major drop positive cases. Good now!! worries. Costco buildings Wisconsin requires masks.

Just stacked republican legislature Supreme Court decided governor/ag can't make emergency declarations mean one wearing mask (though far people are) Yeah, guess. Never heard much this, apparently company needs 50 employees least year, leaves people out. 

Also, many states ""right-to-work states"", means business fire employees reason provide explanation. could fire return. Wow making must now? Thought must world it‚Äôs public place lot people there. need article know enclosed space humans live wearing N95 mask. rely behave appropriately. not. encourage people live follow protocol together.

And get position unless can't get it.

People internalizing infectious phase virus occurs *before* symptoms arise. People likely know infected infect you. know infected pass along. way break chain infection act everyone infectious time. three weeks, would over. together, end. certain American population 10% exposed, lot dying still. volunteer control arm study... say Americans hijacked it. seen many times someone would say Canada part North America Canadian get bent shape tell person need go back school. anything Issue watered identifying ""country"" individual from. point history long long time everyone short hands America. think intentionally it. merely name stuck English started get settled established.

Can't fire dead people. Whats trump going do? Bring military replace teachers strike? Woe crayons. news? norm already! think LOT Americans disagree rule. American culture boggles me. False. Deaths increasing again. large lag time infection death. nationwide mortality rate 4%.

But death issue virus. permanently destroys organs blood vessels. thing wrong Alachua county ACRs. Everyone else seems fine masks. None necessarily easy do, especially short notice. Adding confirmation ordering process drop-in thing. Lots sites also built contractors, many companies would need hire people fix them, takes time money top actual changes made. verify info provided? need somewhere check valid, way prove person using authorized, etc. None simple.

Plus people making recommendations (the CDC) actual power anything let alone enforce restrictions sales, even could done power make happen. think shitshow government would ever step put protections people place cost profits bridge sell you. two best companies I‚Äôve Costco Whole Foods . simply get without mask question I‚Äôve seen people politely asked leave.

This whole thread bewildering me. walmart require masks customers enforce goddamn stores pathetic me. people calling give employees hazard pay shit. Hopefully Health Ambassadors out-of-work bouncers local bars. nice old lady saying ""please put mask on"", they're going get abused ignored. requires using brain obviously cake baking need informal national union organize organizing across greater number stores once.  also long term, people wearing masks faster economy recovers Arizona Maricopa County's fault. 

They ONE HUNDRED PLUS Days prepare, didn't. OP seems missed word ""trucks"" writing post title, title article is: Antonio hospitals using refrigerated trucks bodies, officials say

Perhaps try reading article looking like fool... oldest millenials 40s? American, seen movies TV shows, weird people technology advanced country always look smart people call nerd, must difficult work science educator country. Scientific data understanding logistics guess. $5 friendly wager? extremely well

Pick one happened well. remember asked multiple times talk like everyone else. confusing question me. lot ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù taken away. /s I'm sure dead care freedoms saving Man, I've seen customers basically spitting employee mouths get close talk. plan testing students week classes begin? Oh yea gonna good Totally man. people went high school hometown mostly obese/overweight, lipitor half dozen prescriptions, smoke pack day, barely finished high school believe covid conspiracies totally way better mentally physically me...a guy college degree professional career runs 6 minute mile benches 300+. Ugh, can't wait get hair cut. waist :( ""live free don't"" interesting I'm really sure understand relationship swedes danish people. Bwahahaha yessss gooood ""Party rockers house tonight"" Bruh. made whole rest post still holding hope he's got source immunity numbers? fucking course made Al'Quren friend Talibubba making statement...but comes ignorant babble. 'bout nano chips vaccines A'Q? can't wait this..... find insane think policy implemented nationwide. New York State made mandatory essential establishments (including Walmart) prior Phased re-openings. least local Walmarts grocery stores frequently visit, hear complaints regarding masks. understand this. live near super Walmart everyone wearing masks month. started cops stationed outside. cops gone, matter: every time go there, everyone wearing mask. seeing hundreds people multiple visits last month, ever saw ONE person without mask, vendor delivery person, Walmart employee customer. Well that‚Äôs definitely true. don‚Äôt store advise conversation social media causes backfire effect partially emotional response. Additionally, keep mind humans (and I'm assuming one) tend change minds pattern;

* Learns initial claimed fact.

* initial claimed fact reinforced socialization pattern repetition claimed fact hardened. 

* emotional self-satisfied hook associated claimed fact, becomes even hardened becomes part person's sense self.

* Incompatible claimed fact(s) presented. 

* * done neutral environment, backfire effect may occur two claimed facts may evaluated (even change happens).

* * new claimed fact(s) confront person's sense self person challenged emotionally argument/debate imposed emotional situation, backfire effect occur.

* either case, claimed fact(s) involve person's sense self, change incremental many people end thinking always knew new claimed fact(S) true thus always held new opinion.

A couple examples last one. I've changed mind many things years, including two;

* Equal marriage: used think silly, could matter much. think much opinion, new facts presented, moved much better understanding. Along that, related opinions also shifted.

* Voting rights felons: used think right vote committing convicted felony reasonable extra punishment. Why? that's heard others took opinions somehow reasonable. Now, makes sense me. citizen prison still citizen, nothing changes either released incarceration.

I'd like smug claiming always current opinions, switched immediately presented facts showed justified not, would fictional retelling. People acting like masks actually stop spread rona. Anyone thinks non mask wearer piece shit, bigger piece shit. Masks make little difference crucify people wearing them. 

We already fucked getting way late, we‚Äôre scrambling panicking, blaming people don‚Äôt wear masks continued spread. None wearing masks initially, wasn‚Äôt tidal wave social media told to. hypocrisy mind blowing. supposed go work waiting week test result negative?

The answer yes. live put quarantine result arrives. usually need second one confirm (sometimes one enough, sure rules are, probably depends direct contact).


If walk waiting result endangering others. new Wuhan Yeah work hotel quit weren‚Äôt forcing anybody employees wear masks. wasn‚Äôt safe tourists country coming stay here, like dozen employees get corona everyone required wear mask. makes really mad dozen coworkers get sick management take seriously. majority staff older black women, high risk group. taking seriously beginning opinion considering demographics jobs are. what‚Äôs weird states list. go quarantine two weeks come back quarantine two weeks. probably well recieved lose teaching credentials states? saying suck, would eligible licensed states? Small Town America get attention wants. daft.

Ever hear quote ""Information wants free""?

The correct numbers get out, one country control information level, China... even Chinese leaks.

All cutting CDC reporting faking numbers accomplish making Trump look idiotic. Twitter person gave update today likely economical decision prevent employees becoming sick close stores went walmart yesterday saw handful people without mask, eventhough county already mandate mask!! hope company follows suite. can't think sports bubonic plague jousting.

A quick Google search sports Spanish Flu indicate actually effect sports.

/s bigger growth pre-pandemic, cushion growth turns negative.

And truth told, whatever feeling towards China, better controlling pandemic most. Yes. doesn‚Äôt mean free clear let get bad. 

The herd immunity formula made popular months ago (1-1/r) meant interesting academic purposes doesn‚Äôt real meaning real life. works population native immunity, completely homogeneous susceptibility interaction, population never changes behavior. None real life scenarios.

Real herd immunity generally come lower reasons, especially heterogeneity susceptibility. people weaker immune systems, people jobs social lives make focal point outbreaks, people factors make susceptible , get sick first get taken pool.

Real, organic herd immunity always lower 1-1/r formula. much lower? don‚Äôt way knowing sure get there. don‚Äôt want to, involves hundreds thousands deaths even optimistic scenarios north Bullshit. I've heard smart, informed man basically smart doctor one day we're gonna wake gone like miracle. look measure US better pretty much developed countries. 

This patently false.  growing US developed countries.  

False. US behind peers, shows [remarkable growth  ownership higher US.  

False. [The US behind developed represent severity problem though, Americans deeply debt afford home. fact one third Americans [unable make July housing talk focusing debt really want focus access credit, better US.  

Why would focus lol? Americans dig even deeper incomes remain stagnant cost living continues rise? idea makes sense.  time low COVID, certainly better Europe.  


Real unemployment much higher, whereas pre-covid [US still rate) EU, Russia, Australia, UK, China, Israel, etc. Worse nearly peers.  benefits paid unemployed US Covid one best unemployment benefit packages world.  

The unemployment package reflection suppressed wages workers US, remained largely stagnant since 1970s. 140,000 Americans died thus far, representing 1/4 world's total deaths, US currently 1/3 world's active cases, slowing down. 1,000,000 Americans likely die virus order secure couple extra quarters profit small percent wealthy shareholders. US faired economically compared rest world certainly encouraging.  


Again, 1/4-1/3 Americans without work, 1/3 Americans cannot afford rent mortgages, Americans deepening debt. Meanwhile, US world leader death virus, continues grow. don‚Äôt think fully understand could happened didn‚Äôt recovery witnessed. You‚Äôd see groceries empty, closing across country. Trade lines disrupted. isn‚Äôt yet, every metric seeing incredibly encouraging.  


I think incredibly naive imagine we're going escape deep depression. massive debt bubble bursting, global confidence American bonds weakening Dollar loses grip global market. Unlike great depression, we're going depression coupled heightened austerity, leading worsening conditions Americans. high likelihood government turn war order pull us it. literally going get worse. But, plenty things still closed, hospitals open business, lots people wearing masks, social distancing mandated. Walmart Ozark Trail Camping Chair $3. Aisle 11. Helluva deal. Defund government institutions.

Like defunding Decrease trust government

Like pretending president literal fascist using every media outlet promote Say government work

Like every political party says time sitting Give power companies.

Like Hollywood insurance companies opposed defense contractors Enrich voter base.

As opposed seeking impoverish voter base.

People make pandemic game scoring political points worst kinds people. I'm scarbs one wearing masks. spent day yesterday making masks people new rule. live TN +90% residents Christians/Catholics. half churches shut break new case record sevral times week. People going church Montana full, cases spiking. Everyone please stay away. Walmart still people working stores?

The one closest work (so one shop every then) busy supercenter. took coronavirus opportunity remodel front store cut check registers **4** installing massive banks self checkouts either end. I'd say early adopter self checkouts 25 years ago, that's wanted get get quick possible armful stuff. giant cart full week's worth groceries better believe want someone check stuff bags load belt.

That me. I'm going higher priced local grocer chain on. haven‚Äôt grocery store Target since beginning March. I‚Äôve either drive stuff delivered. play fools. want play Russian Roulette deadly virus, that‚Äôs you. I‚Äôm sticking butt home since nobody taking seriously. Toch al xD That's little extreme know it. would like escorted building private property allowed enforce rules keep shoppers employees safe. right safe y'all wear masks easy way would get out, rest world knows we're idiots let us in.  already has. State Victoria spiked couple thousand cases last week so. entire state locked down. Still comparable situation US. half US states cases entirety Australia. Dont sign demand safer alternative. I'm pretty sure reading headline months, least shutdown.

Then still two weeks headline.


Or could less testing. start limiting tests 25,000 day increases cases every day ever exceed 25,000 think point could consider control.  guess meant totalitarian.... November might nasty surprise you. Oh man. Im already looking forward complete meltdowns posted publicfreakout etc lot experiments 50/50, maybe 40/60 depending statistical structure. I'm pretty sure asked investigate state immunity, whole point people behave normally possible, lot people test antibodies start take risks, data become skewed useless. called double blind trials neither researcher knows whether got vaccine experiment over. Arkansas, right work state, fire reason. keep mouth shut say anything incriminating, enough witnesses say happen. Holy shit, huge fight Corona. perspective anyone outside US, people area probably 80%-90% shopping Walmart. #3 place many people spend indoor time at, home work. 

Walmart end stop Corona president.

T-cell immunity seems stronger Oxford vaccine, there‚Äôs reason write one completely stopgap better vaccine comes out. *ETA: either way, need wait Phase 2 3 data making broad claims efficacy safety.

I don‚Äôt care personal beliefs vaccine. care you‚Äôre spreading misinformation corrected CD8/T-cell thing. I‚Äôm going trust scientific community one. clapped, eh? can‚Äôt using brand ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù shut people point obvious conflicts interest. pro-vaccines anti-corruption. both. system doesn‚Äôt work unless people trust it. especially important whole system beyond reproach. maybe ever. shouldn‚Äôt let stakes excuse let things like slide. difficult compare CFR two countries right now.

Italy's daily infections low basically passed first wave infections. means enough time cases Italy resolve either recover pass away.

The US even peak current wave cases. somewhere around 1 million current cases tested positive past two weeks. enough time US cases resolved. means potentially lot current active cases make it.

Basically, confirmed case count rises death count rises. make CFR look lower everything resolved. Testing ""united stand, divided fall"" theory.  Depends they're using cases deaths total numbers per capita data. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Mexico rocketing charts. Middle East countries South Africa coming behind too.

Maybe they're split name it'll 2020 Americas Flu. rules redneck states already policies mandated state level. Wallmart already armed security high risk stores years. isn‚Äôt new territory them. It‚Äôs gonna 90 yr old greeter knives begin come out. Watch Pence closely - begins openly disagree Trump Trump way out. I'm kinda tempted hang wait Karen's Ken's lose it.

Flurida thrilled buy food, wouldntcha? honestly are, though. 18-20 like 0-2 years age controlled parents (or less still mostly stuck home relying money parents).

we guarantee someone going try that. course. could also lead infection. What's point speculating? avoid carry on. Viruses mutate randomly, long period tends make less lethal. Since lethal ones, decimate host species. that's ""long term"" short term random. There's always hidden agenda fox news large amount anti-maskers Walmart shopping option

This makes think going good thing. sad is, Walmart unique position finally get idiots take seriously. That's good. went Target teenaged girl standing door telling people wear masks. felt bad knowing people probably rude hell Oh lol disagreement here. Defer school year? heck talking cashier 10 minutes? States people waiting 2 weeks test results employers dont offer sick leave. haven‚Äôt left house 5 months? Really? thought cost everyone unless lucky enough one insurers eating cost.

At testing center here, fiancee paid $175 pocket tests.

Was PCR test antibody? much happier couple armed thugs stormed beat shit people, you? all, probably Trump voters. *""There optimistic scenario second virus begins spread: new pathogen finds harder move around alert world, rapidly detected wherever arrives, fizzles cautious citizens guard up.""*

Yep. one thing make mistakes: everyone makes mistakes, PM Denmark fact explicitly said 'I know make mistakes' terms handling crisis. 

But making mistakes becomes problem swept rug remain unaddressed. unhealthy way approach life. I'm gonna go hangout Walmart lobby collect content. used words anecdotal epidemiologist. word imply understand little bit statistics infectious diseases, least enough know look. makes intelligent American standards, trust me.

Please help understand I'm missing here. Maybe 1/3 shoppers local Walmart bother wearing mask. even employees seem wearing them.

Ok, Captain. Let get magic wand. understand point. excess deaths sure why, perhaps lockdown contributed.

I also trying say able catch covid deaths, current method counting deaths accurate overcounting. 


That said may also missing deaths really knows deaths are. I‚Äôd hard time living fact might one allowed family Coronavirus. I'd say hire bouncers, probably want spend money. 

Wouldn't great law enforcement turned blind eye Walmart greeters beating customers way bouncers beating drunks? Oh that's interesting wrinkle situation never thought of!

Really root problem.

If people isolating got money could keep living, testing prioritized e.g. health care workers.  fact people work starve means disease going keep spreading - enough people take chance others infected.

Just another reason federal government lesser extent state governments failed continue fail people US. sickness really astounding thing disconnected reality company believe a) customers extra cash around current economic climate b) giving money sometime landlords way priority right now. Oh please. kind one-dimensional demonization entire professions absurd. 

If anything, think they're hoping make point potential consequences risk we're asking teachers take. 

Also, Republicans working really hard ensure employers held liable COVID-19 infections. 

Not mention fact proving someone infected would nearly impossible; achieve even low ""more likely not"" standard without test results everyone person contact two weeks preceding infection finding positive results school?

These brightest bulbs pack. cops stationed Walmart 24/7 much action first comment lmao like Walmart gives fuck karen keep waiting somehow guys manage find enough food Remember told 100,000 people would get infected entire course pandemic? Thank you. Hugs back everyone. even hit hardest move families homes people can't worse us. üòî Fuck whole system. ok, I'm single man, I'm husband! think regional thing.

‚ÄúThere plan place...‚Äù

Context really important here. Reading this, there‚Äôs indication bodies stored yet, trucks refrigerated available need be.

Until actual reports bodies stored refrigerated trucks, post valid. absolutely indication yet.

Feel bad bullshit ‚ÄúHealth Ambassadors‚Äù deal with. Except once. one time ever. Walmart Greeter jump several spots dangerous professions.  RIP USA :'( Trump would absolutely fine entire American educational system collapsing.

 It‚Äôs goal GOP years. I'm denying still good. interesting people willing forgive. 

But hope right, I'm willing proven wrong. Here's hoping broken record gets fixed. support isn‚Äôt needed this, really, it‚Äôd definitely interesting conversation DeSantis. mean, mass murderer calls culling people says everything going great? I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs worse wishing death others, you. ready hundreds new Karen videos Honestly, responded Covid way that's better employees many retailers. Especially one claims ""working pleasure."" getting danger pay, required sign liability waiver work expected SUPPLY MASK (store longer providing employees giving blue branded masks). Long-term, eventually going part tipping culture gradually becomes ‚Äúrequired‚Äù optional. Kind like Uber Lyft transitioned model Try asking /r/Masks4All, they're pretty helpful I‚Äôm relaxed chilled weed! time turn 21, eh? voluntarily unfortunately get called Karen ask people put mask. Women wear masks get called Karen... name lost meaning. actually pretty direct pointed question. attempt mislead anyone. Maybe try new word? It‚Äôs start. Waiting people die mandate.

Seeing average Facebook comment section Walmart's mask mandate makes care dying sometimes. ""and paying people..."" Lol Walmart talking about. News anchors work getting rid Southern accents type perception. effective way would stores enforce timeout period. x number people refuse wear masks shopping, close store hour (give excuse like need clean store due people wearing masks). there's chance hell Walmart would volunteer lose money like that. Alabama put mask order. jump TN shitty southern state rankings? /r/EntitledBitch well. Dumbasses. Tell running facial recognition. They'll mask up. gonna lose business way....which I'm totally ok with. won'y 100% compliance, even say, 30% did, still wreaks havoc pandemic reporting.

Good luck America, gonna need it. Every time something like posted find wondering thing...

""Why done CDC first announced guidelines?"" give idea what's possible: live extremely dense urban environment. dense NYC. cases Covid show January, lot Americans still thought hoax. scaled current numbers match US population, have: 220k infected quarantine, showing symptoms worthy hospitalization; 1,100 patients hospitalized, total 189 deaths. Since January.

This largely proper contact tracing teams place back January, empowered place risk contacts mandatory (paid) quarantine. Turns hard keep control dedicate enough resources finding potential infected. that's due secret insider knowledge anything, looking happening China start year, expecting spread happen. ‚ÄúCustomer always right‚Äù myth gonna get put test. started way promote good customer service created swath entitled idiots. Well deserved seem angry. considered finding hobby? Probably. fair, average Walmart worker time energy really think things like unionization. like there's real hope getting union ground anyway, there's incentive form real opinion. Dam theres real cave dwellers sub. Try applying logic getting educated subject instead exhibiting Dunning-Krueger world see. Smallpox spread exactly like influenza, makes masks extremely occurred inhalation airborne Variola virus, usually droplets expressed oral, nasal, pharyngeal mucosa infected person. transmitted one person another primarily prolonged face-to-face contact infected person, usually within distance 1.8 (6 feet)

Now take dumb ass home. Boris Johnson hospitalised still give shit forecast outcome, 5 people killed first week, one child. multiple vehicle persons/property rammings, least one store set fire. 


To clear, want none happen.


We're dealing people low cognitive processing 'normal' privileged life completely challenged every front. eyes ""fake media"", minority fight like civil rights movement them.


We live crazy time everyone race write new normal. approach intentional love others carefully crafted rage. makes completely stupid, look completely stupid. capitalists party might intelligent, rank file boors platform stupid. getting promising US vaccine mixed Oxford vaccine. two different vaccines. Oxford vaccine MERS vaccine already halfway development MERS dried up, pulled redesigned COVID. googled it, right, bacterium. Although true bacterium likely transmitted humans fleas. 10,000 cases instead, everything fine.  We're actively told can't anything customers even really ask leave, ask consider wearing mask. really half measure. Yeah one uses turn signals (looking BMW) insurance isnt always mandatory, is, sometimes much people don‚Äôt anyways, do, doesn‚Äôt bring life back dead. 

The seatbelt argument pointed strictly driver protection. way effect someone else, family loved ones myself. 

The point is, everyday take risks people don‚Äôt follow, laws, rules, guidelines whatever. mask way. I‚Äôve able drive accident free whole short life, avoiding countless idiots wrongdoing came me. get accident someone else, still spreads. spreads pain sorrow families friends involved. like virus, pains loss sorrow healed fade time. hope helps clear car analogy Hollywood Studios provide 3 tests week film TV cast crews. get 'wear mask get fucking smashed' trend? think enough people get fucking attacked essentially engendering others, maybe fucking get really hits hard sometimes people like actually exist legitimately believe things say crazy first place, even crazier probably even close one worst ones. Good luck people come contact you.  I'm sure big company like Walmart.  know local places saw ""green phase"" literally saw traffic light saying go. Yup, rule United Airline's San Francisco Shanghai flights began last week. heard, lot people upset rule set fail. control get tested there's way tell lab workers get results within 48hrs departure. getting danger pay, required sign liability waiver work, SUPPLY MASK (store longer providing employees giving blue branded masks). This, all. poor people Clearly Charlotte County Commissioners' meeting taking ""In God Trust"" literally mean come save them. risk, Health Ambassador sounds like dream job pandemic. would love tell ignorant mother fuckers piss day.

Indoor dining..

You know, usual stuff. *""we like fake bodies fresh""* see couple high risk individuals thumbnail spread like similar viruses. That's exactly point. like viruses (respiratory not) probably need masks would spread actively sick, actively sick *far* less likely about. reason even need *everyone* wear masks instead sick spreads even pre- a-symptomatic people know sick. hints February/March, sure, become much clear since then. Huh, better late never guess 

When comes real important stuff America really lacks behind rest world pandemic really shows what's wrong user thread wisely pointed Walmart afford hire security. needs happen stores.

We've security guards controlling entry ever Walmart I've since March Canada lockdown happened here.  hear people grumbling, line almost always moves fast frankly awesome get store &lt;50 total people. Super fast get want deal packs idiots blocking aisles. support freedom press, fox news ridiculous. Still considering mask mandate. Sigh.

I notice said gets regularly tested...that‚Äôs great... consideration getting TIMELY tests results rest us?   Lol wasn‚Äôt thing yet? Guys, country fucking trash. Escape, NOW! Flipfloping start new pandemic one knows anything sure, advices based best guesses normal. whole world working millions different aspects pandemic contradictory results arrive daily, one pick choose say. That's normal too.

Sure, waited final results take action, saying anything, say, 2030.

That difference making scientific assessment vs public policies. 2030 right timing scientific assessment. figure lot SARS 2003. May wait anything. time, Stanford researchers refused sign onto study bad, turned funded founder major airline outspoken ""reopen"" pusher (Jet Blue, Stanford research team failed disclose seems take issue fact funding JetBlue negates test. Would say study showed high IFR would also negated funding kind organization might ""dog fight""? Like .. high IFR study shouldnt valid kind democratic funding ""they probably want hurt Trump"" something? Seems harsh.

And seems major criticisms Ioannidis study over-estimated number Covid infections, ioannidiNowhere question scientific conduct louder Stanford University, trio researchers accused promoting faulty analysis ‚Äútipping scale‚Äù antibody studies **they say proves virus widespread less lethal feared**, public health restrictions strict.

But ..

Dont kind agree virus indeed widespread less lethal feared?

[CDC Antibody Studies Confirm Huge Gap COVID-19 Infections Known difference implies virus much less deadly looks, also makes contact tracing daunting challenge.

It seems earlier study vindicted way, no? indeed many infections thought. say 10x many.

[CDC says COVID-19 cases U.S. may 10 times higher .. everybody saying Ioannidis math bad wasnt many infections said. .. situation changed.

Ioannidis' ""low IFR"" also line sources. Center Evidence Based Medicine Oxford University.

[The Centre Evidence-Based Centre Evidence-Based Medicine based Nuffield Department Primary Care Health Sciences University Oxford academic-led centre dedicated practice, teaching dissemination high quality evidence-based medicine improve healthcare everyday clinical could make simple estimation IFR 0.41%**, based halving lowest boundary CFR prediction interval. However, considerable uncertainty many people disease, proportion asymptomatic (and demographics affected) **means IFR likely overestimate**.

Nobody attacked ""bad science"". He‚Äôs learned nothing. Asymptomatic presymtomatic spread reasons virus difficult said encourages anyone symptoms get tested. There‚Äôs *many* things disingenuous Also correct. take statement face value. access giant jug hand sanitizer could keep nearby rather running bathroom time? Let guess. He's got (R) name? Walmart requiring masks not? researchers also offered clients free diagnostic tests coronavirus. Sixty-seven accepted; rest declined. tested, turned negative. Top comment literally Karen making signage last 5 months? trash see normal day Walmart, go well. Make sure y'all phones charged shop folks read state's newspapers cold, calculating course know, that's criticised poster said ""we get it, hate black people"" op thread never mentioned race movement full races... comment nothing BLM movement, entirely people immediately playing victim card faced challenge beliefs (valid/invalid challenged alike).

BLM could substituted Trump rally instead saying ""we get it, hate black people"" could said ""we get nazi"" would made comment Okay.  many people ""medical issues"" suddenly wear mask hilarious sad.

We one race - human race - lot people understand basic level. country successfully ""stopped"" CV19 effective testing tracing, I'd happy let idiot USA serve sort Phase 4 trial rather demanding rushed vaccines. Maybe. Don‚Äôt worry know even less researchers longer access data. I'm sure place place, seem remember used tents.  

I think making doctors horrific. got damaging physical mental health. main reason expanded testing captures mild cases accordingly fewer hospitalizations per confirmed case. anyone graphic, talks 1% deaths ? Goes 19% people hospitalizations, number complications, kinda thing? saw graphic save post this: work spec ed. There‚Äôs good answer haven‚Äôt heard ideas far seem like they‚Äôll work. 

I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm going assess students determine eligibility. one grade level. Everyone social-emotional concerns. look forward siege videos r/publicfreakout Monday I'm India. govt announced vaccine human trials begin mid July vaccine released mid August. That's one month. ONE month they've announced they'll release trials even begun.

So definition quick/unsafe different right now, I'm take vaccine tested months heartbeat. know nuances mask debate US. Germany experts well early-mid March, argument provide protection person wearing masks thus lull people false sense security abandon social distancing (still effective measure). Cloth masks mask protects others acceptable alternative eventually. mean, USA same? come USA avoiding recession? get groceries today saw several people that. frustrating Center what?

No one ever achieved communism supporting fascists. Sincere question: legally limit liability, arises gross negligence intentional misconduct? countries cannot, even would sign, limitation would void. says linked early stages pandemic. pretty sure extrapolate data now. would see people lower cognitive ability ones still refusing wear masks. able smell fart also key sign!

I'm Holland schools open without trouble. CDC also adviced keep open panic society closed them... Luckily they're open now. think downsides schools open kids long term much much much bigger little effect might health. Education great equalizer. education later income major determinator health well later age.

Some downsides school closures explanation:

  Children Won‚Äôt Progress Rate
  Missing Education Impact Children‚Äôs Mental Health
  School Closures Affect Children‚Äôs Nutrition
  Children May Reluctant Return benefit child would highly recommend bring school.

Note healthwise Sweden also fine without closing schools. Norway admitted need close schools too.

I think controlled spread population right strategy. early strict lockdown open later trouble later like Isreal now, already major impact economy. think much Europe reached herd immunity. Protect old frail possibly closing big events enough. Keeping everything fully open (also big indoor events) seems lead trouble. Although I'm sure ICUs overflown America (if that's good measure success) Austria everything's open without trouble. Holland almost like that. problem is, whats point savings interest 0.01% negative FED money printing inflation? everyone pushing debtor, big corporations issuing 30-yr bonds yielding 2% everyone desperate give loan them. know doing. anyone make Karma come. like 4 months late.

And realize ICU designation, that's good add beds. Hopefully, reach true capacity. feel hospital staff right can't imagine shitshow they're facing daily. Oops please forgive - that‚Äôs actually 3 UNPAID sick days unless good union job successfully negotiated reasonable contract - even Nonsense. Scottish government recommends wearing masks enclosed spaces, physical distancing difficult risk close contact multiple people members household, wear face covering. 

I wish people would stop confusing UK England. one change, given number stores size customer base, fact retail location many lower income communities, going make difference. make stick.

Sucks prideful still wrong. Hope get insecurity worked out. shopping Walmart anywhere couple months, least since we've hot weather. There's way I'm standing line outside heat wave unnecessary shopping plus covid stuff stresses out. I'm high risk isolate complaints instead demanding everyone around wear masks learning news, might pick cloudy day shopping Walmart. appreciated. excited videos.  Takes breath away Depends Club. worked several college range clientele Costco ""I pay shop here, want"" mentality. saying know will?

Or wish it?   Nothing reply disingenuous..  testing, ppe, flu, open early, masks work, ""liberate Michigan"". Hijack data force narrative stick.

It might go fine time.

And Moderna started officially working mRNA vaccines 10 years ago, also 10 years research platform alone. Plenty people working tools another SARS situation quite situation speed process.

The numbers funny long time. July alone John Hopkins STOPPED POSTING county level map. going check Tulsa County Trump Rally, longer show county level click one county. estimated killed third European population, course much longer 2 years...

It affected different places different times kept periodically popping back initial outbreaks went through. Maybe try find someone make one tech type moisture wicking shirt? I've thought making those. may help problem. False equivalency. flu smallpox. eradicated masks. People want wear masks going even less likely wear masks tell never touch throughout day, never remove take breather drink water. make seem like completely ineffective unless take x number extremely restrictive measures.

None article, though avoiding touching mask front obviously good idea. pictures quite clearly show simple mistakes avoided. sort overly long complex list. Wear mask public make sure mouth nose properly (when part open air) simple instructions vast majority people understand. non-mask wearing crowd, people wear masks realise point get people wear masks first place. level mask wearing better none. can't make extremely restrictive deter people first place. That's counterproductive.

We're two different discussions here. article getting people wear masks trying convert hoaxers. informing mask wearers properly widespread problem people realising right way it.

Also really worth keeping mind long history successful public health PSAs people responded changed behaviour small ways informed (whether centuries old ""spitting spreads TB"" campaigns prevent public spitting modern ""catch it, kill it, bin it""). need overly cautious reaction telling public do.

Though American speak remember studies experience living London. case large swathes population fragile cannot bear see posters dos don'ts wrt mask wearing much deeper issues Finally grew little pirate beard. shave head twice though. sister hairstylist going ask haircut said bother wearing mask anything stayed open shutdowns shit. lives AZ decided hard pass that.

A good part next four years consist recovering pandemic preparing next one, tasks expertise epidemiology would critical.  Medical expertise needed long overdue correction health care system.

So... Biden/Fauci 2020.  dude abides. go even further. argue new world order taking away freedom, separating us other, enslaving us homes.

Oh wait. Companies kick still. Dipshit. care passing on. cruel say, every anti-masker died would them. got tested yesterday. results tomorrow. mom showed symptoms got back hours.

The new belief poverty war made disease influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill young old, higher survival rate between, Spanish flu pandemic resulted higher expected mortality rate young adults.[5] Scientists offer several possible explanations high mortality rate 1918 influenza pandemic. analyses shown virus particularly deadly triggers cytokine storm, ravages stronger immune system young adults.[6] contrast, 2007 analysis medical journals period pandemic found viral infection aggressive previous influenza strains.[7][8] Instead, malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps hospitals, poor hygiene, exacerbated recent war, promoted bacterial superinfection. superinfection killed victims, typically somewhat prolonged death bed.[9][10]

This frankly shocking COVID killing many people peacetime vastly improved standard living, food distribution, medical technology. barely put pants, let alone face covering. won‚Äôt go well.... already case state. actually didnt know thing stores. got many colds younger. mean I‚Äôm less safe this? people throwing around term ""Karens"" (referring angry white woman) often, noted white people putting fight wearing mask.

conservatives tell mask get wallyworld: REEEEEEE rights REEE serve cheap chinese goods face wrath!!! ok, amazon is! There's lot individual workers do, realistically speaking. Texas right-to-work state, attempt sue company could lead dismissed ""unrelated"" reason.

I'm PA, another right-to-work state. PA mandated mask-wearing workplaces. job done premises, employers enforcing mask policy. people wear masks, take frequently can't bothered. best company would move desk (from room airflow highly-trafficked room). recourse, tried escalate anything get health protected like be, I'm afraid could lose job. get sick traceable back workplace, could probably sue, options otherwise. Way back February, read article quoted public health expert said never look back pandemic wish less, may look back wish more. case life death, think prudent Chicken Little-ish alternative being, ""oh well, sorry died economy LOL,"" Fed's stance right now. guy stabbed older employee state employee asked put mask, per state executive order.

Police ended shooting stabber he's dead. great dude. least corona kill you. really showed virus.

Last knew, employee critical serious condition. fact taken long holy shit! social science researcher field emphasizes collective humanity: it‚Äôs incredibly common say Whites Blacks. It‚Äôs demeaning way. Oh man sounds rough . Yea ive showing alot symptoms fevers ranging 103 105 since 1st. Id like get results know weather diff serious health issue. data look good, actually peer reviewed vetted publishing, once.

It's actually better quality normally see, know stock pump theory coming case.

If wanted pump stocks, could released preprint public like everyone else instead giving experts pick pull apart first. Would effective stocks way, tbh. Republicans insane child murderers. They'll starve death week then. gonna get 25¬¢ boxes macaroni cheese from? Target masks mandatory charges least 50¬¢. worry. They'll associates watch active shooter training video fifth time year. solve problem! Yeah Quebec 3 days peak felt long lol I'd love hear 2nd Shutdown honestly. hard is, know there's perfect answer Pandemic shutdown right call imo.

I much hope he'll pull trigger that. I'd love wrong though trust me.

I'd also happy decides schools need remain closed masks mandatory. We'll see....

Stay safe! Spazzing goal. Delivery curbside deprives audience. 

(I've stopped going local grocery stores antimaskers blocking aisles ramming people carts trying start fights. people really shop.) OK, sure exactly bringing conversation. Peace. Singapore huge anomaly two reasons. One almost cases far among foreign worker population. guys mostly work construction, mostly fairly young, heavily screened signs illness entering country. cramped living conditions meant virus spread community like wildfire, exceptionally low risk group dying virus. Oh, government trying test every last foreign worker country, finding many slightly ill people countries would never register virus.

The reason Singapore fully staffed trained contact tracing team ready go back January. first cases arrived China. traced contacts required go quarantine (and none garbage stay home honor system 'quarantine', paid staycation crappy hotel allowed leave). every person find virus, put twenty people quarantine. Besides obvious effectiveness limiting spread virus, means people get sick, already monitored signs start showing symptoms. lot easier prevent deaths patients already hospital hooked O2 monitor get sick. They‚Äôre appeasing ~~Trump~~ oligarchs expense.

This sums politics US since 1776. Easy say hindsight. kid 18. 

I'm fine getting boss involved. Walmart street old house customer throw bleach employee customers. need hazard pay anyway. think masks Monday. look forward videos shitshow‚Äôs produce. hope one gets shot. responded someone Instagram comments (obviously mistake nothing better do) one time trying argue store clerk's job enforce wearing mask store; they're serve nothing more. typed 6-7 sentences outlining things wrong particular stance met ""lmao wasted time I'm reading that. can't make someone wear mask"". 

Like - can't anything point, you? person essentially lost forever point. people want stay ignorance alternative requires actual effort. said black suit, nobody talking black guys. come from? Mexico required since quarantine began, amazed required US Gov says feels bit achy otherwise fine. Remember COVID patients feel fine right point need hospitalization. know inflection point happens. taken weeks happened hours others. seems like roll dice individual. also price gouged cleaning supplies N95 masks back March. proof sitting around day?

 [here‚Äôs link provided access research paper another dubious article posted 3 days ago. necessary two articles post paywall.

However it‚Äôs fairly common knowledge research communities usually find research articles free visiting authors website; found article.

You‚Äôre also free ask anything you‚Äôd like it, don‚Äôt need go paywall. curiosity, what's difference then? Walmart signs weeks say enter without mask, yet 25% people wearing masks. going suddenly start enforcing rule place several weeks? I'll believe see it. Meh. point watch hospital ICU bed counts. I'm frustrated. Another...12 months this, we're lucky. need vacation, but...there's nowhere go. Feh.

I support idea anyway: Walmart it. I'm pretending second afford spare change couch. particular group people could read comment Add NHL tests too!

Black Plague started noticable run 1348 lasted 5 years tapering off. sporadically reoccurred throughout Europe centuries, never intensity first round. yes, kill third Europe, got remember population medieval Europe astronomically lower world population around 1918-1920 (less 100 million vs. 1 billion). even though Spanish flu much lower death RATE (in percentage terms), numeric measure killed far people pandemic - even lower death rate - simply infected many people. 

We seen another global pandemic deadly Black Plague terms percentage infected people died disease (not even close), purely numerical terms even disease relatively low fatality rate (like COVID-19) could kill people TOTAL Plague. I'm ready Walmart freak vids hell gonna break loose! Every major metro area big outbreak 4-5% positive antibodies - except NYC. extent NYC outlier (23%) makes numbers suspect. extremely likely antibody tests used cross-reactivity common cold causing coronavirus antibodies. look numbers tell they've exactly going do. 1918.  modern medicine, clean drinking water, wastewater treatment systems, wide availability soaps sanitizers.

Yes, Walmart issues complying local state regulations around wearing masks, mine made mandatory weekend St. Patrick's Day. 

The stores enacted communities made issue politics refuse responsibly legislate. Walmart responsibly legislate behalf. Sure, children less risk children super spreaders presumably live adults. It‚Äôs incredible DeSantis refuses connect two dots base can‚Äôt/refuses make connection Wow, good thing never shop Walmart üëç Menards MN requires masks. think it‚Äôs great. Work hospital, hero pay cutting benefits fired 2-3% workforce. makes obvious really mask bothering all. bothers repeatedly told something understand, combined sympathy anybody around them, refuse like petulant spoiled brats. got reference. Thats actually true, first arent essential, second offer form accommodation ( face shields things offer ) dont accept offered accommodations still ask leave, State government made clear covid-19 meets direct threat guidelines meaning medical exemption still asked leave. last importantly Tribal land. first two things work tribal regard masks, generally ADA prohibits places public accommodation restrictions would limit access individual disability. However, ADA allow restrictions individual would pose direct threat health safety others.

And schools reopening 2 months I've heard.... lots support students teachers buddy works asset protection Walmart catching crack heads steal. worry potential exposure work went get tested next day, expected 2-4 day wait time.

After week calling hold least 3 hours total, finally get hold could tell due ""supply shortage"", gonna estimated 3 weeks get results.

I teleworkered anyway in-case, state testing USA joke. 

They fully booked entire week test, imagine many people similar situation. Unacceptable. anyone recommend mask purchase fits face adult male? I'm 6'0, 205 lbs.

US government *isn‚Äôt* killing people? must witnessing shitshow rest us.

Dont think absolving them. never made original statement even reasoning understood people need learn vet information generally take interest world around instead letting everyone tell everything.

Hell, could time even said dont know COVID works viruses case wear mask since effective almost everything else spreads close proximity. trivial, tiny thing people acting like they're persecuted. say reply types people? Good

""WalMart lost business""

*Sigh*, least there'll lot great content r/FuckYouKaren r/PublicFreakout people around wearing masks, wearing chin. Black suits usually used intimidation, brought something would actually scare Wow took halfway fucking july -___- america joke  amount death would near entire population US Doesn‚Äôt come women tip-out. applaud Walmart. 

They're literally allowed tell people wear masks let thank matter excuse give. well. paper dive science behind mask wearing slows spread all? shcocked people get violent forced wear mask. Thats laziness new level. /r/masks4all Oh hey, thanks. check every day two, last gave update 4 5 days ago. Sounds like he's going while.  Jeez that's brilliant. sounds right. think focus improving people's memory, and/or regulations media propaganda? would think walmart would capability get ffp3 masks. doubt care enough workers. Time somebody something prevent spread least little bit... braindead wig potato President obviously isn‚Äôt able handle own. article may helpful: ""Speaking increases release respiratory droplets 10 fold; \~200 virus particles per minute. Again, assuming every virus inhaled, would take \~5 minutes speaking face-to-face receive required dose."" (I think without distancing) 

But cashier happens super-spreader, risk may higher. people super infectious peak. Right let people talk wearing masks indoors (I work high risk patients). live Wisconsin I'm worried too. want buy cheap groceries without risking life understand... guess kids staying home.. super vulnerable, entire time younger people would problems virus staying home dont want spread vulnerable, get vulnerable vaccinated, start getting kids back school. support this. also fully expect see major meltdowns people WalMart yelling FrEeDoM! It‚Äôs semantics. Many people believe Sweden‚Äôs strategy create slow burn rid virus. strategy. It‚Äôs not. 

In understanding, big difference Sweden‚Äôs strategy many countries degree suppress virus. Tegnell‚Äôs FHM‚Äôs view, cannot. It‚Äôs matter flattening curve. It‚Äôs really pessimistic view do. Herd immunity consequence. 

Other countries optimistic perspective suppression. 

Time tell right assessment. 

But Sweden‚Äôs strategy aimed killing elderly safeguarding economy. It‚Äôs keeping medical care system working. /r/PublicFreakout anticipating greatly future posts!  You‚Äôre insecure take reddit seriously care people think anonymous website lmao law. country like 50th world since March country dying many ways noisy 35% troglodytes led lunatic. Maybe start brain shaming ... know, like little Johnny acted ruined everybody. base needs Go Principals office learn social academic skills. Impeachment doesn‚Äôt mean removal office, know. Bill Clinton also impeached (and also removed office). allow ambassador tell selfish bastards ‚Äústay home don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù, I‚Äôll apply job. Ya man served multiple administrations without politicizing job. He's start now. may stupid question, niece high school graduation party (in-person) end month. small town, imagine people wearing masks. three hours long, supposedly mostly outside. But... wise idea attend? I'd course wear mask, nobody else wearing one, I'm exactly staying safe. Would attend something like right now, would bail pandemic? I‚Äôm curious - small town public list going FB stores don‚Äôt enforce state rule. Walmart Albertsons big names.
I like list know go. can't wait see tik tok videos work town‚Äôs Farmer‚Äôs Market. hire security assholes screaming obscenities sweet hippie girls *volunteer*, making cry.
We way anyone‚Äôs option food, honestly shocked level rage came people asked wear mask completely voluntary environment. Yes, it‚Äôs outside, 3-5k people try descend town square once, even limiting numbers close. still beg people stop fondling produce bringing entire extended family...it‚Äôs shitshow I‚Äôm sick tired much people suck. 

 cannot imagine hell unleashed Walmart employees. May God mercy souls. Hoping see Hillsborough start tick down. Isn‚Äôt Walmart policy interact customers like could walk store stealing can‚Äôt stop me. get around using cops security sometimes. exactly health ambassador going crazy person. mean he's spot people wont listen unless forced fucked Oh yeah like HF. got sliding compound miter saw use one time like $80. Still using 6 years later.

It doesn‚Äôt cut straight bar definitely isn‚Äôt 90 degrees blade, cut wood. usually hand shoes wife let try untie knot. Mask Casket homie, choice. Wow blamed. everyone caught YOLO'd way crowds got sick completely innocent. I've reading covid stay air linger poorly circulated buildings. work coffee shop wondering safe (behind counter) remove mask drink water/coffee? Second question regarding lingering air: wear mask walking hallways apartment even people around? Something used develop national strategy... care, 1% great banks show record profits! /s B-b-but get muh lawn fertilizer! Agree. know sub going like ‚Äúbut bathrooms‚Äù. Close that‚Äôs issue. seriously don‚Äôt understand hate anyone goes outside here. places contribute spread. probably I've seen many ""pro masks"" people (do call that?) circle wagons fall praise every last one businesses enact mandate nearly daring someone go even slightest bit, bad mouth anyone dared even ask mask wear since they've heard different things different situations (or completely ignore arguments), spotlight obvious trolls legit questions asked.

Just feels like equate people (not all) rioters BLM movement. like saying nothing can't vaccines staying safe taking seriously STILL questioning masks indeed effective tool combat virus.

And think aggressive. think either people seen many Karens, still scared stiff virus, seeing endless news cycle is. social media like anymore. Surely someone irl stream twitch Florida Walmarts get huge $$$$$$$ I‚Äôd sub heartbeat that's great job suited it. we're still allowed wear pajamas, right? walmart employee, can‚Äôt wait see angry people hate mask get turned away. Sweden performed 600,000 tests.

America performed 44 million tests. first woman pictured video mask covering nose. ""2 weeks"" Colorado wildfire season swing, we're putting much quicker usual. actually good thing.

Typically we'll allow certain amount fire (the amount actually helps keep forest healthy) know probably resources manage fires -- we're going quick containment.

Better homes human lives short term, potentially bad forest health long term. are. It‚Äôs fucking time. state mask mandate place 4 months I‚Äôve always seen least couple people local Walmart clearly didn‚Äôt even bring mask. 

I finally confronted day saw 6 people without masks ten minute trip (this completely locked one set doors signs specifically stating make customers wear masks). told company policy force customers wear masks even required law. asked allowed make customers wear clothes masks got stupid look. 

After contacted Walmart corporate offices states Covid compliance hotline,
so I‚Äôm saying is, you‚Äôre welcome everyone. America big country. would expect American standards high first place? wear clothes example. ok that?  

Because we've wearing clothes 200,000 years. poor, I'd give award that. Perfectly summarizes short-term memory loss Americans. Seriously though. people complaining shutting economy single handedly causing pandemic last longer should... see this?! live Alabama surprised hear guns drawn lmao rate 2019 American flu talked history books Wtf. Really worth reading:

‚ÄúOur data looks like it‚Äôs somewhere three 10 times infectious,‚Äù Luban says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty enormous effect.‚Äù

That mean mutation effect real world, says virologist Emma Hodcroft University Basel. past, notes, ‚ÄúWe cases really thought evidence mutation changing viral behavior evidence came, didn‚Äôt seem case.‚Äù

Perhaps there‚Äôs little selection pressure virus races millions immunologically na√Øve people, scientists say. could change advent vaccines new therapies, forcing virus evolve. could also indicate virus people longer know, spreading first known cases Wuhan, China, December 2019. ‚ÄúThe evolution virus become human pathogen may already happened missed it,‚Äù Rasmussen says.

- Read full article. NM lot private labs (turnaround nearly slow AZ, usually 3ish days positives, maybe negatives priority them) know started state lab suddenly trying figure go M-F 9-5 operation 24 hour without killing staff. believe hired temps, maxed everything could, still needed help. much state labs used dealing with, especially part drastically underfunded departments is. Maybe it‚Äôs I‚Äôm mobile.  ""Hancock told BBC government looked making wearing masks offices rejected idea basis people spend long time together, face coverings offer protection.""

- logic horrible. way would make sense people spent time people office. employees go home contract virus, come back work wear mask...makes ZERO sense. Abbott still shut Jenkins made run local surplus store optimistic outlook second half 2020 . trying stock whatever case worse case scenario even can't imagine happens . Walmart technically requiring month. haven‚Äôt enforcing all. I‚Äôm expecting change know feel. work, people ignore masks like half time, realized serious them. Usually, whenever walk past someone wearing mask corridor, notice me, grab scarf something they're wearing mutter ""OH SORRY."". say something along lines ""EVIL EVIL EVIL!"". weird required whole US every store via law.   Neither President nice try  Yeah, leave Coronavirus alone!! üò≠ Dems proposed entire plan address every one issues. called HEROES act. GOP pass it.

So one party care, entire government. laughed hard opening line. 

*Cuts Jim News*

""And go live Jim Jimmerson live, Jimsville square.... Jim?....Jim....?""

""Jim apparently died coronavirus"" basis presidency, feel current conspiracy situations started, many bought original onslaught kept going till ended today. Realistically lockdown faired quite well looking statistics projections US.. Surprisedpikachu.jpg... ""It‚Äôs going disappear. One day, it‚Äôs like miracle, disappear""

Turns right ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Dr. Fauci true patriot constant attempts discredit disgrace fucking bullshit! Yeah, tell Bill Gates using AI face recognition track movements forced get vaccination full 5g autism. wear mask, undetectable. state Nah, CEO said interview need hazard pay love serve. OK, recorded thank message us cell phone safety mansion blast across TVs electronics time. clear, saying hiring trained security. anyone standing door controlling entry building security guard common parlance. Relative state standards, I‚Äôd argue Colorado worst neighbors. Sorry, thank you. I'm staying house get delivery people like make delivery people stay healthy. Must get painful. I've gone less 5 times since March, wore P100 mask one time went inside. Run course? Antibodies starting show decreasing effectiveness time, hence people may get infected repeatedly. possibility herd immunity question. Plus many infected fight via mechanism antibodies develop even short term immunity reinfection. 

Its increasingly looking like going away, akin seasonal flu likely reoccurance. Half-hearted attempts containment starting look fruitless; need eradication strategy like NZ, can't see government swallowing bitter political pill time far wasted. Hahahaha funniest cope ive seen Ah okay, got it. could selfishness yeah. 

Or think risk overblown thought hard. think common reasob. Like, think ""there's virus going around"" might translate ""I need stay away everyone.""

It's understandable. comparable pandemic one 1918 flu. Since we've SARS, H1N1, etc. old enough remember shut world tell everyone avoid people outside household? not, makes sense people used take proper precautions, even authorities telling need to. Instructions like feel disconnected someone's life easy think ""yeah tell us this, it'll fine."" Ah...whoops, ok don't, makes worse...so guess don't...oh wait, say help...no...no, ok indoors but...wow. Also outdoors. crowds? Unless overcast Thursday. wind SW. care top 0.01%... Someone ask thinks HHS demanding hospital data rather cdc receiving it. Rife administration data massage therapy propaganda. trade advisor medical degree. already envision Trump Tweets 2021, talking Biden's inaction handle China virus. problem already noticed door greeters: ""I asthma"". ""I medical condition."" ""I collapsed lung.""

People lie, cant force wear mask, possible chance telling truth. lard hard. amount smears, harassment abuse get opposing side debate anything natural. They're probably running space corporate offices huge bundles money blocking hallways Amazon making much pandemic. They've managed double guaranteed shipping time raise prices non - perishable foods making huge profits. trust god given intelligence natural laws. trust someone's gut instead, results different. ""trucks""

Had confused minute... like use morgues Colleen Bridger, interim director Metropolitan Health District assistant city manager, said plan place hospitals ask refrigerated trucks hold bodies longer fit morgues. said trucks already use area facilities, specify many Bryan Alsip, University Health System, said hospitals don‚Äôt large morgues, refrigerated trucks needed handle overflow bodies. said University Hospital might need trucks. last 5 weeks? Almost states huge new record numbers cases, call achievement. Center **DISEASE CONTROL...** longer access current disease data. can't write stuff. I‚Äôm criticizing I‚Äôm criticizing CDC policy telling citizens masks aren‚Äôt important purported underhanded purpose preserving high-quality PPE medical purposes.

My point could easily solved problem working Home Depot (which fact do) instead lying Americans. Perhaps. made Youtube channel posting relevant info 2-3 times week, would achieved more. supposed wear masks public places Walmart doesn‚Äôt enforce plus half employees least noses uncovered. Cowards Walmart. think article BS. Every test known specificity sensitivity. It‚Äôs cobbled together random facts. don‚Äôt buy article valid source. course blame fascist Republicans, also blame Republican Democrats. Congrats. learned businesses avoid political stances. tell download app order online. That's reasonable accommodation. relative failure compared nordic states. 60 million unemployed run unemployment desperation kicks in, riots even bigger BLM protests. 

The incredible negligence surreal, I‚Äôm starting think it‚Äôs deliberate. enough folks wearing masks prior State Order.

When bars opened up, folks filled up, even reduced capacity 

The homeless population also bolstered numbers. Hopefully realize security absolutely going injure someone way probably even touch matter due lawsuits I've hoping 20 years. far, luck. That‚Äôs like see four months study extensively virus spreads. don‚Äôt wait. apply knowledge already attack spreads based knowledge. Happy cake day you!  I've never certain content link lol Still waiting company let WFH...live Florida BTW  Walmart, prepare shit storm anti mask idiots ready go full murica you. Feels bad staff deal crap, good move either way. everything people post care shits US Yes. This! Weeeeell, WH *is* sitting billions dollars congress-approved relief money absolutely oversight spend it.

Anyone think qualms providing ""relief"" comply demands? favorite: people trust scientists??? research don‚Äôt sheep!!1

Okay I‚Äôll spend 8 years researching every possible subject paying thousands access high quality lab publish papers *everything* 

That would take god knows many lifetimes. reason compartmentalize knowledge meta studies thing!! lots people dedicate years sifting papers studies evaluate quality data personally don‚Äôt time every subject, yeah I‚Äôll read quality meta analysis get good picture concept. It‚Äôs blindly trusting science, it‚Äôs reality time learn every subject even read multiple papers every subject.

When types mean research mean google YouTube wikipedia learned MIDDLE SCHOOL net good sources terrible way find papers. 

Sigh read ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust scientists think myself‚Äù one time think I‚Äôm going curl ball cry please wake September ends live rural IL mask usage hit miss. freedom...

He loses least 5 freedom points wears mask.

/s get 100% compliance. fact they're get compliance lot people deal hassled. need 100% compliance. 99.9% compliance almost exactly good.

Cops definitely get called. 5000 Walmart locations country. cops Walmart somewhere 24/7/365. they'll work out. mean you‚Äôre hotspot area, think it‚Äôs inevitable eventually catch virus within next year aren‚Äôt masking/social distancing. spread rampant enough, there‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness usual‚Äù lot people. point catch family. Walmart going deal backlash, pitifully paid hard working Walmart employees. Working Wal-Mart hazard bonuses every day Ok, you‚Äôre asshole doesn‚Äôt care. Got it. fragile little baby it‚Äôs uncomfortable. Ha. And, trashiest all. Come back even basic understanding taxation foundations Faucis Bizzar Adventures! Welcome north Korea 24 minutes go üò¨ Most. Many landlords already started process. legislation prevents ""eviction"" halt process. already filed paperwork gone courts execute eviction day protection expires instead wait 30 days. cause, damages injuries are** alleged fault **alleged caused negligence carelessness Releasees.**

This going extraordinarily harrowing fall. We're going see truly horrifying stuff. time you‚Äôre indoors control need wear mask ensure safety. learned best! think best ways fight back curb lobbying special interests making mockery elections.  
We need blow local reps start online fundraisers hospitals overwhelmed, encouraging continue report CDC. absolute shame thing twice federal aid money already collective ""fundraiser"" tax dollars, used bully hospitals reporting numbers shredder rather agency designed. hate free speech? know rest you, every time saw Fauci TV, felt better. Like, we'll get past somehow instead prepare doom. (the latter whenever Trump opened mouth). think Fauci knew everything, that's impossible novel virus, least seemed competent give best possible educated guess time.

Pulling TV spots so, stupid. Feuding absolutely insane. Very. Sorry. Meanwhile live, bars open sort mask policy Well hopefully current situation change that. Walmart definitely regarded quality employer, know.  Boycott Walmart. Wait, what? people still think flu need catch get over.

Sadly, one bosses one them, he's american working Mexico believes go back office get it, even though work done home. ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety.""

What need look coming weeks/months data changes projected, implication change (is motive) determine \[if much data tampered\].

As bad news is, need look data PROVE manipulating it.

Additionally, would extremely weary certainly used \[malicious\] motivations. angle look this, good road ahead.

**Make mistake options could used here:**

* Downplay pandemic
* Increase/decrease confirm numbers incorrect discredit science.
* Increase numbers erode trust put pressure 'how handling it'

*\[Adjusted comment mods removed last one due political nature\]* already killed people wearing mask.. difference gun going make. Strane way write ""I evidence support claim"" lol came back Bergamo UK September last year. Whilst Italy unusual body odour days. got back approximately 2 weeks Bergamo, got hives body, lasted 4-5 days. Seriously worst thing I've ever scary. I'm otherwise healthy never allergic reaction anything ever, told must allergic reaction.

Now see article today others coronavirus could circulating mutating early September last year, seriously makes wonder especially Bergamo worst affected place. article number 49 mentioned CDC review posted. 67 tested 104 interviewed. upvoted comment article trying downplay information misleading. Put right anti-mask people essentially person chosen within store given black polo shown training videos. say can't wear one reason let in. say one memo says directed inside get one. can't block deny entry anyone. window dressing PR guy, go it! 
If girl.... well considering 2 years plenty time grow back, go it! enough state governors set public database. Requiring masks one thing. enforcing part done am. cities mandated wearing masks public.

EDIT: want add nasal swab. need sideways carrot like U.S. worst outbreak world, 3.4 million infections 136,000 deaths, horseshit leadership.

I mean that's pretty valid assessment. hear Karens martching already Well obviously depending god end them. tyranny!

MASKS DONT WORK - Try disprove !! WATCH PPP EXPERT EXPLAIN FAKE DANGEROUS Love $2,000 month whatever end immediately things fine. Since opposition keeps acting like things fine quickly, obviously know won‚Äôt be. Also theres requirement large lockdown economy really go shitter make much less. mean ""Ivy league elites"" trying tell rest us do? /s people who've made money swings younger people.

At point youngest baby boomer 56 age people generally heavily invested stocks. that's much true get 60s 70s (the age range boomers). People forget food deserts. Walmart put local grocery stores business miles around. cases like childhood hometown, they'll that, decide profitable enough, bail leave people 45min+ grocery store. China billion people tested 62,000/1M. US positivity rate 8.6% obviously everything control.  Member people wanted lock email lady? hair girlfriend‚Äôs jeans wouldn‚Äôt come  Like announcement sanitizing stores. happening them, consistently. Good thing liable three act negligently.

Dumb people need get way. Religious people included this. think invisible ghostman causes everything, he‚Äôs evil you‚Äôre stupid. Neither think. 

We don‚Äôt need literacy test voting, need common sense test. think masks don‚Äôt work Mexicans drug-dealing rapists, you‚Äôre dumb racist vote.

Unsurprisingly enough work while. correct information unfortunately account keep posting fake information bending true information interests. Beseeching God help virus foolish exercise futility, Mr. Health Minister.

 ""With testing, near extinct practice contact tracing, non-availability hospital beds lack coordination within various wings government, Karnataka faces uphill task battle virus.""

Looks like Karnataka screwed America.  bet would pretty easy convince hand trillion dollars rich powerful though. Fauci vs. cornucopia stupidity vanity. trump administration doesn‚Äôt care (Kanye voice) 

Why hate smart people country idolize idiots? 2.8 million people die US every year, 7500 every day. extra 1000 top concerning, panic inducing.

I absolutely support people wearing masks they're indoors public, they're morons realizing this. still useful put things perspective. accounting idiots think hoax. going get tested virus think exists?

And tons unreported Covid deaths US. Florida alone extra 20k+ deaths marked Pneumonia least 18k Covid related.  Can‚Äôt wait see Tuesday‚Äôs headlines  air traffic controllers federal employees, technically illegal strike federal employee. legally Reagan fire them. hand, teachers federal employees reasonably safe strike.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm defending Reagan, find action egregious, clarifying mass firing teachers going happen like mass firing Air traffic controllers. reasonable

I'll sure let families deceased died 30 days corvid19 know, okay, claiming died something else. carve tombstones okay? ""DIDNT DIE COVID, FLU BRO, DIABETIC OKAY, MOVE ALONG NOTHING SEE bit arbitrary

Nah, arbitrary, numbers remains anybody takes longer count way average estimates remains correct. miss some

No shit, SherlocküòÑ True, numbers work. enough qualified teachers replace fire, strength strike. Turns out, Trump suck-up brand marketed Latinos probably bad business decision. Really hope not!  that‚Äôs true...maybe harmless least 99% infections fatal. Likely Infection fatality rate less 1. That‚Äôs underestimate severity though, assuming population 328 million that‚Äôs 3 million, 280,000 deaths America alone! 

I‚Äôm aware sometimes longer term effects I‚Äôve yet, personally, see compelling evidence isn‚Äôt worst, worst cases. lot ‚Äúlong lasting damage‚Äù seems months.

This incredibly serious there‚Äôs point spreading misinformation. vast vast majority infections result death. late. friend. know kind late game, always thought okay wear mask outside long maintain distance people. 

Does anyone insights links data this? see people masks outside, without, idea what's right wrong. rest area Northern Europe actually took realistic early measures combat disease much better cherry picked locations. there‚Äôs really NEED wear masks well combatting this.

Here US basically worst response planet...things little different. Far measures desperately needed try slow spread down.

Meanwhile people like want compare apples oranges try downplay seriousness what‚Äôs going US.

What happened Europe far cry situation here. Stop trying make excuses wear mask. Trump symptom, cause. old-timey concept seems like invitation security guards end getting shot. electric scooter. Doesn‚Äôt every store already require masks point? first time I‚Äôm hearing place didn‚Äôt already require it. $300 needed guaranteed explosive investment return people would acting like investment greatest thing ever. Fuck sales pitch. Honestly avoid Wal-Mart. wear see morons putting others risk fredums. Haha I‚Äôve actively avoiding Walmart since start thing. there‚Äôs anywhere I‚Äôm going get covid, it‚Äôs going walmart Interesting.

I‚Äôm Australia, Walmart isn‚Äôt thing I‚Äôm also Territory Covid-19 non-existent apart couple US Marines isolating Barracks. (Said tongue cheek)......‚ÄùWow, virus hoax really getting elaborate Walmart board.......‚Äù real 

Obviously many people NC aren‚Äôt helping situation, overall NC giving thing good fight.

These surrounding states making things incredibly difficult, every license plate see SC, Tennessee Florida. Virginia, you‚Äôve okay compared others.  also might suffer acutely genetic disease(the Royal genetic disease) incest far bloodline. grandpa mom effected I'm probably affected too.  squiggle one way celebrate! People finally caught Columbus bit prick say mildly, ""The Middle-Indies"" probably too... see think third second, natural selection poor health, constitution, immune system. I'm happy guys Sean Hannity donate proceeds first responders. fact even console false equivalency suggests still incapable facing reality.

You wish administration handled China did. confirmed covid hospitilization rates US. CDC website: math wrong? numbers seem super low

* +65 yr olds, 316.9 per 100,000;
* 18--49 yr olds, 66.7 per 100,000
* example, 18--49 yr olds, 66.7/100,000 less 1% end hospital covid19?

UPDATE:

* think numbers saying 18--49 yr olds, less 1% \*of total population\* ended hospital covid19
* real interesting number percent \*of infected\* end hospital?And compare known quantity like flu? I'm shocked father said one yet. thought Obama Muslim literally anti-Christ. problem masks (local mandates anyway) - love that's holy, get Walmart employee that's ""sanitizing"" shopping carts least learn wear mask properly? Chin mask ain't much good there, lady.... one work dental office, usually use though I'm secretary (I wear KN-95 day). definitely option. case Massachusetts weeks stores required to.

The bigger news states enforced mandatory mask laws.  Hardly means anything. get reliable test results days infection, nasal swabs reliable enough even hope high school negatives contain false ones. Especially light symptoms early infection, false negative rates range 100%-20%. 100% within day infection 20% within 3 days displaying symptoms. (All Harvard's corona FAQ)

Not mention test negative week school starts really negative still get time testing campus. think there's millions people extreme right GOP right democrat think extremist?

Wonder bad idiot think they're idiot. think concern that, unless washed sanitized hands, could contaminating mask. No, wishing people dead steal homes kind fucked up. Many police departments understaffed enough employees deal day day problems emergencies. add people constantly calling individuals wearing masks - can't handle huge volume increase calls. Especially many people refusing wear masks constant issue. Priority going placed individuals wearing masks wearing appropriately. scheduled get cleaning couple weeks ago. mix-up confirmation process, ended rescheduling 2 weeks now.

The study flawed. much undeniable point. gave sorts evidence it, literally investigated bias bad. CDC never used authority death rate, yet months. 

I completely correct that, argument that. made argument that. 

I've seen enough know specific agenda change views matter what, interest letting change subject engaging different topic. deciding dangerous waiting 5 days? except u know 130,000 people died. youd think masks differently parents died school two-week winter break, long enough separate classes in, winter semester January April. Hey look someone understand what's happening United States wrote couple paragraphs blaming us. Nice.  final reply, I‚Äôm assuming didn‚Äôt catch quick edits. AGREE. part. 

There always bad apples people taking stuff seriously. always risk life. right now, virus risk still isn‚Äôt point it‚Äôs concerning. Sorry. way numbers are. death rate slowed tremendously. it‚Äôs high New York. saying since beginning, deadlines virus, lack preparation New York. weren‚Äôt ready, that‚Äôs lost lives. deserve 500 word essay EPSLA EFMLA went effect April 1st require employers give least 6 weeks PTO 100% pay anyone quarantine order due Covid-19, well providing conditions well. funded federal government really isn‚Äôt much reason employer even that.

In United States system failed... said I‚Äôm taking seriously? I‚Äôm giving data. Sorry loss. And? saying stuff?

I make 50 work part time.

A family member makes close 100 full time. crazy. Might well go full CBRN gear get [one would add another level intimidation too. love conclusion ""this study wrong"" ""yeah, we're morons, BLM!!!""

You even try dispute fact anti-mask cult lacking intelligence compared general population. accept it, know true. doubt would many. cases, ""you need wear mask come in"" suffice maybe eye roll snide comment shouted.

Out object, person door says, ""either leave come back mask Bubba make leave,"" vast majority comply.

Yes, small minority look use physical force. Bubba there. assume police also there. wall street bets. stopped reporting CDC. That's going bring numbers down! common cold coronaviruses, think using knew them, basis better place start making hypothesises, radical idea immunized long term. 

I think nice reassure people, silly instill false hopes. every developed nation done. Instead making us laughing stock world. 

He unequivocally failed. WORST RESPONSE WORLD. try deflect twist things anyways want. fact anyone looks graph count see. US hasn‚Äôt gone mandatory masks question studied dissected endlessly epidemiologists, sociologists, historians, political scientists like years come.  

Truly one bizarre, tragic preventable catastrophes modern times. Hey that's mask use! seriously work auto parts store (a small one that, ton space inside) people inside 5-10 mins MAX. hard wear one short amount time... **hell** already requirement? SMH @ stupidity entitlement.  little late one huh Wally World?? Smdh know ""module"" is, term used federal government describe reporting functions, cut shit out. sounds like CDC going collate Maybe does, maybe doesn't. Depends new collection agency director listens Changing data collection indicate way.

It otherwise wouldn‚Äôt said it. ""Well protected""? I'm even sure means. could sub agency less ""protected"" parent agency, controls everything it?

The CDC less political appointees similarly sized agencies. CDC also large public health agency whose director senante confirmed. means less poltical capital *hence* less protected. protected what? Political monkeying? 

Yes. protection political monkeying 1) laws prevent firing define succession, would apply differently CDC parent likelihood, 2) presidential appointees reside, which, again, totally irrelevant HHS, parent agency, controls CDC.

That incorrect. It‚Äôs irrelevant. Read previous. asinine suggest sub agency controlled parent entirely somehow newly ""vulnerable"". Vulnerable what? 

The CDC brings lot credibility reputation helps protect it‚Äôs needed. I‚Äôm referring vulnerable, seeming lose need credibility move suggests *to me*. provided quite literally concrete discussion explains way words mean, fantasize mythical relationships parent sub agencies basis reality.

I can‚Äôt provide discussion. provided comment. next reasonable step would ask clarify. still disagreed would given stronger position understanding mean. understanding isn‚Äôt standard hold self too. 

The CDCs relationship HHS based HHS secretary often intervene CDC protect politically. used relationship older younger sibling that‚Äôs reminds of. throwing around empty words playing people's deep misunderstanding bureaucracy sound like know something.

Anyone free disagree encourage better you. spent entire comment describing ""weakness"" CDC, quite literally explained nothing means

And spent entire comment attacking bothering clarify it. So, you‚Äôve confirmed, don‚Äôt really even know you‚Äôre attacking. made two massive speculative comments: 1) government giving mitigation, 2) things worse.

How anything speculation? We‚Äôre outside speculating. fact is, government's public health arm operated primarily scientists overridden scientific effort taken bureaucrats closer president, who, necessarily lose contradicting him, weaker reputation (and thus commitment) ensuring truth.

It‚Äôs lead directors policy always case. That‚Äôs exact value senate confirmed director bunch poltical appointees. know means Trump pressure HHS collect report differently, given way reported problems way data reported, bet move motives line that.

I doubt it, hence comment. Walmart Sams club near employing 3rd party security crazies. wife talks increased second wave risk sending newborn daycare learn socialize. Also push careers since world stopping virus wife needs finish PHD leave shit-hole red-state live in.

But second wave news hitting last 2 weeks, decided quit job. hated anyway, 1.5hour way commute 3 days week long hours made hate career, well miss important parts son's development. idea do, definitely less money taking loan cover rent/food get household sick Covit, potential one us die top 20k hospital bills. helps wife less year finish, otherwise IDK I'd do.

I hope get clarity. Political agenda not, comment fact invalid statement correct it. Walmarts cops? one near one near family regularly cop patrolling. Especially holiday shopping season. even dedicated parking spot cop car. People wear masks might. globally? I‚Äôm Canada Walmart‚Äôs? came say exact thing. gonna get REALLY bad. Also supply complimentary masks, since they'll offering mask customers one. going WWE IRL. means never miss chance tell it. choose opt face-to-face instruction favor 100% virtual instruction.

At least option. agree overall sentiment data likely manipulated cases (to skew results either direction), case linking inflating number cases, inflating positive test rate reporting negative results. Basically, place 1,000 tests found 150 positives reporting 150 positives 100% positive rate rather 150 positives 15% positive rate.

So cases inflated, positive rate cases, labs reported positive test results, report number negative test results. actions do, America fucking every one too.

Words impact - consistent, clear public health messaging used around world supress virus. 

Guess worked? Downplaying threat, ignoring scientific evidence confusing public message. 

Want proof? look America, UK Brazil stand death charts three forces play. stock market funneled billions/trillions dollars America. Trump put Wall Street bros charge important government institutions Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. removed oversight ‚Äústimulus‚Äù bailout money. Federal Reserve (Central Bank Cartel) working along BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, financial institutions propped phony market. large corporations lobbying power working politicians keep money flowing them. 

Their scheme would worked virus controlled. banking V shape virus recovery (like New Zealand). underestimated virus. Wall Street trying figure do. Especially lockdowns continue, earning season disappoints, Joe Biden continues lead President. Ah, cant prove it? Thanks proving right. Damn easy. 

Lol good job. Published Memorial Day. Last updated June 20. even anything said half way true tribal council decided ADA rules compliance follow not. 

For example dog owners tried take us court loss several times cause sovereign state. adhere service dog laws except one, tribe allows security ask documentation service animals based discretion ( normally ask little dogs carriers ,)

My legs like jello simply can‚Äôt get enough air body mask on. Yeah country earth wants Sweden's death toll per million.  aren‚Äôt sending data CDC

I go confirm that, could believe could possibly true.

I'm microbiologist outside US. CDC website ""go to"" point event news possible new outbreak, need quick information something I'm really familiar with.

Rumour news outbreak ""galloping dandruff"" Guatemala - Log happening Ebola outbreak DRC? -  \- get picture.

I'm probably exagerating slightly, something Science, Nature, NEJM, JAMA,The Lancet CDC website - would hard time convincing thoroughly researched true.

So reports data major Pandemic sent CDC obviously fake - another sign far US goverment fallen. Hopefully employ security min wagers dont deal karens. shame one Gram fill thimble Trump hater watcher dam give way ontop American citizens think US citizen here, confused are.

Enjoy!  guys anti maskers well? got mask Tuesday, work? really. waiting test supposed self isolating. helps irresponsible going Public. pretty obvious chose write Alabama agenda is.

Well, please bear obtuseness tell BNO News' agenda is. 

What agenda would Dutch news wire service respect Alabama?

The 'article' says Alabama has:

* 57,218 cases total, which
  * 0 new cases and
  * 1164 deaths, 
  * 2.03% death rate.

Also, article table showing confirmed cases Coronavirus U.S. single Alabama, lists data 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico.

Is OP guilty bias correctly identifies Alabama increased death count 1124 1164?

So, back questions:

* (reporting cumulative deaths Alabama) cherry-picking ?
  * provide link report news story reputable media outlet proves this?
   * Put another way, prove reporting Alabama 1164 CoViD-19 deaths false, misrepresentative? anything, makes cautious knowing sooner rather later. Sorry, clarify describe outlier compared companies know (including region areas personal professional contacts). much outlier hard believe, do. think Americans care enough education teaching realize teachers better parents. Furthermore, every child home environment makes learning possible. kids? year half year missed school going put kids far behind (and many -risk already behind). respect school teachers enough recognize much free daycare. Sadly Oklahoma. We're real stupid here. Would downvoted posting ‚ÄúI agree?‚Äù Probably not, adds discussion. Stop gatekeeping, especially given original comment tinge ironic humor. Anti-mask people much worse. drug addict excuse, addiction disease. Wait. think it, ignorance disease well. already thing?! bullshit. watched two Latinas refused wear masks. stop using Karen. happens days lady starbucks san diego freaked barista. guy made 90k donations I'm same. hair deal with. mustache driving nuts. Good Walmart this. companies totally enforce stuff. government can't enough, take private companies help battle virus. Canada region cases far right now, still businesses this. Masks required work, employees. 15 people work local store, one itch daily wear mask. Including managers.


Without doubt, would enforce this. managers might try, would feel uncomfortable telling regulars wear mask,and I'm sure others even think masks anything would feel.


Kudos Walmart though guess. good harm, hopefully. feel bad local police departments field calls this. majority blm protest white. complained open protest spreading covid say BLM protest. *far* left, recently, self-evidently üòâ Well, standard accommodations recommended businesses ADA-compliant alternatives people cannot wear mask. go it...


its title shitty movie made literally LOL. clever. Thanks breaking boring work day  people sucking away people nice actions whatever else... dont know else tell [That's nice alternative reality got That's easily proven wrong would funny damn sad trying spread bs begin with.  Supposedly they're hiring person who's specific job sit door black polo tell people need mask. Adult potty training also isn't. Amazing find surprise poop stores. Assume anything covered E Coli. assume much handwashing happening. makes good point secondhand smoke. 

Should go back allowing smokers restaurants everywhere? know lot conservatives cannot stand cigarette smoke. wonder would feel campaign reverse California laws nuisance.  Southern North Americans? Christ, mean wear one time? hate people treat retailer workers.

The day, Walmart witnessed old codger belittling employee wearing mask, telling virus hoax sheeple. 

The best part, however, came another customer walked over, pulled mask down, loudly said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs worth risk make sure hear loud clear tell look like insane asshole, yelling EMPLOYEE, management, even department head, policy ZERO control something selfless ones without complaint. Put f‚Äôing mask stay f home!‚Äù

There 10 us witnessed this. clapped hurriedly pulled mask marched cart like hadn‚Äôt stopped chewed someone new asshole. old guy first looked shocked begin slithering toward door tail tucked legs.

She Karen haircut clothes awesome seeing one good change. Biden win. Sorry loss. apologize wording harshly. (I think bit obvious I'm rage-fillled individual that's closer wounded animal human point.) 

I blame society whole entirely though. We're literally raised wrong environment wrong mindsets. extremely difficult break ""see Matrix"" lack better analogy.

If read actual purposes foundations see lot merely profit-based set overall populace always disadvantage never position overcome.

Quick examples: 

Education system - set create working class man, thinker type. production drives country.

Lies benefits: food pyramid. Something basic bullshit. Dairy needed much claim. merely pushed us majority dairy used time dry milk powder similar items going army. huge surplus regular dairy products. solution? Lie create whole campaign dairy super important us.

Not bashing dairy. fucking love milk, cheese, yogurts. I'm saying though, they're willing create whole ass campaigns stuff like that, imagine kind fake knowledge drop us actually important stuff.  It‚Äôs good idea states can‚Äôt control enters. Everyone would drive Maine. Washington Post feel needed publish op ed? talk hair dresser. Mine partitioned room uses 1 hair dresser wait outside ready. also required people wear mask even mandatory felt fairly safe going her. Yesterday first haircut since February. Won‚Äôt pretty, it‚Äôs unlikely Walmart employee would one get rid non compliant. gotta call cops, places likely already waiting first request. Private property, you‚Äôre allowed whatever want someone else‚Äôs business

Edit: kinda funny anti mask pro cop pro capitalism people gonna start video taped dragged away cops away corporations ought fun mandatory before??? Everywhere go, including Walmart, masks required entry.  join you... GOOD. FINALLY. small hometown (where spent large portion quarantine) would wear mask everywhere get many strange looks people walmart. doesnt help huge, evil corporation help country White House. honest this. I've run sympathy Americans.

You worst enemies, guy top leading enemies. Dumb, conservative, (yes know said conservative three times). government necessarily trying eliminate ethnic racial minorities. there's system racist policies ideas keeps ethnic racial minorities poverty, makes harder access level health care people like me, behaves apathetically towards marginalized groups.

I think government *making* happen much *letting* happen.

The fact minority groups suffering white people US natural consequence racist forces play country long time now. Idk. I'm psychologist. every personality test I've ever taken even professionally assessed says I'm extrovert. Y‚Äôall Qaeda Thank you! understanding well it‚Äôs believe problem solved without poor public policy.  Make mandates suppliers sell, like did! without lying American people. Would‚Äôve much better way covid doesn‚Äôt like America giiiittttt out! would good time open Liberty Store. Anti Face mask establishment staffed freedom loving citizens.  Yeah professional suppose explain principal ""treat first ever kills faster lethal"". information even asking for? asking see proof Swedish people can't survive without breathing too? asking study lethalness hypoxia? asking proof Sweden treat thing considered one severe triage proceedings? would likely lead shootout. people try something new! Fuck wont wasting precious 2 seconds understand something dont know. Guess really know Democrats huh. Walmart making masks mandatory Thanks felt great disturbance Force, millions karens suddenly cried terror suddenly complaining. fear something terrible happen. Yep, CDC get data, virus magically disappear. I'm patience. Bye. new cases reported Tuesday United starting feel like March. Businesses closing. Hospitals filling.

[CDC Mine Florida single point since started people outside counting. masked employee door watch maskless people walk daily another employee support. Lmao. outsiders perspective, country's refusal wear masks looks like absolute insanity. can't even comprehend issue all, especially cases rise. One factions setting use bird codenames two players Crow Jackdaw. So, way, we're playing corvid campaign.

I totally feel pandemic setting. Seems fun. ???? No, definitely aren't. smoke weed daily, probably never vote republican, think mask mandates fucking stupid. 

Everything world black white, left vs right, etc. There's millions people think sides extremist idiots. Safeway near hired bouncers bar district town, since work right around Safeway need anymore. effective, think get confrontations per shift used dealing drunks... strictly enforce senior hours, watching lay hands irate towners insisting need small items great.  get hit? Man, would want work there. imagine worse place going run entitled ignorant anti-mask lunatics. Target, maybe? blocked fully understand - far many stores ""looking way"" easier inviting confrontation. that's going change much. first.
 
Except, retailer/establishment/city/whatever institutes mandatory face covering rule, becomes little normalized ingrained acceptable, normal behavior. 50% becomes 55%, another supermarket town adds requirement becomes 58% 60% usage norm. end month large chunk ""I want wear mask"" brigade simply easier putting fight (not them, many them), eventually becomes habit. far great, *literally* every little bit helps. would think would ideal time revise state tax strategy. Lots businesses needed adapt due this, state different.

If think sadly people Florida financial liability state. Please do! make sure stream Reddit! literally people pulled guns workers requiring masks. Americans stupid. Eggselent! Thanks bunch! Obviously that's possible explanation, idea end day, you? Point is, we're advocating widespread mask compliance which, demonstrate us, half assed measure best. everything wrong everything went wrong  That‚Äôs exactly local Walmart. Tons people completely ignore store full unmasked shoppers staff. KY masks mandatory since last Friday. report couple times already. still go back over. local wal-mart required people wear masks, amount people mask chin plus dense crowd people made anxious hell get it, hate equality black people glad I'm living anymore Facebook friend posted article. someone explain merit? not?

Edit: instead downvoting don‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs bullshit? That‚Äôs bias leads believe, bias isn‚Äôt good enough; want understand *why* it‚Äôs bullshit. [citation needed] Yeah, unfortunately that‚Äôs continue get blood hands. It‚Äôs like really care though. economy bloodstream. Yea two shittiest response countries (‚Äúno masks‚Äù led Boris ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù (that‚Äôs backfiring Sweden)), that‚Äôs called cherry picking.

That‚Äôs like trying say America fine displaying infection data Montana only. Great, biased, job. Yet still half deaths New York, despite basically never locking all. goes show uniquely bad got New York. issue movement. Think 2 seconds group hyper prevalent past months? makes perfect sense BLM would come social distancing brought Protests hard social distance in.

This outrage culture begining fucking wear down. many want see bad purposely look it. Interesting. wonder line vaccine-skeptic folks anti-vaxxers tend go sources. (All anti-vaxxers I'm acquainted sharing Plandemic video high wide well mostly post evidence things sketchy sources like Natural News.) Herd Immunity dog whistle kill welfare recipients. Policies like genocide masked indifference. I'll grab popcorn upcoming Wal-Mart, PublicFreakout videos. went local Latin market last week, big sign front saying masks required. also sizable dude security uniform standing entrance. Lol. 

I hope places this. makes crazy become political issue. Sometimes explain joke... Minnesota, Illinois parts Wisconsin Iowa count. called dooomer majority sub? happened *months* ago. Viva la revolution. Many Walmart guests barely bothered wear appropriate clothing normal day, interesting like Canadian border closure‚Äôs ‚Äúthe border closure extended another month‚Äù every month situation, bet it‚Äôs going same. reason people like slow drip It‚Äôs shame likely chin straps. wearing mouth, seems getting rare nose also covered. do, please record share! Lol. Hours posted government official reported a

Proof, again, one ever question Trump commitment truth, even makes look bad. lmao Guess shopping Walmart anymore Canada, Public Health dictated supposed self-isolate awaiting results tests, cases required self-isolate 14 days even test returns negative (if known close contact carrier disease example).

Fortunately, also programs provide temporary financial assistance allow policy choice. demographic? I'm hoping rest follow (Meijer, Kroger properties, etc). Walmart outlier particular community anti maskers flood mask optional places. i'd love see customers start singing union songs walmart. can't exactly fire people work em. are. Requirement Wal-Mart properties.

Also, look read article. Rioters looters wearing masks already. didn‚Äôt want get caught cctv.  Always excuses. Baby sweat it
I promise always fine
I'll never forget
I'm always debt
Baby opened mind  Damn may live pretty close one... They're private company, want. That's capitalism. happy it, must communist. Got it. feelings care facts. still top class? seen average appearance usual 'virussy fit' customer?

My money war vet. boomers, people die hard fans certain candidate believe everything says. So, another comment said ""only joke"", first assumption well reading comment, elaborating, one it? that's Russian mafia. I‚Äôm going make point critique Vox reinfection article-

Even information comes out, still don‚Äôt know sure immunity, level, length time. It‚Äôs fine optimistic pessimistic tone comments, it‚Äôs fine make ‚ÄúI think‚Äù statements. don‚Äôt act like know something scientists researching don‚Äôt know. Ask leave. tell trespassing. predict go smoothly.

Another similarity: class tension. See reaction employers concept allowing work home, hazard pay labor rights. 

Medieval reactions included Statute Labourers price fixing wages employment pre-pandemic status, various peasant rebellions migrations cities *despite* known risks. clear class tensions remained remain. true pan-solidarity. We've tried nothing and, except child sacrifice, ideas. Walmart already requiring masks. course 20% people take suggestion ‚Äúallergies‚Äù imagine worked places like germany japan etc , ie first world countries resources task forces.

It seems trump made pence head would burn together went south moreso expectation pences ability lead crisis , mention im rather convinced pence never real power anything far top engagement virus (no budget decision making powers)


The fact wartime powers never actually used force factories retool mask production telling , fellow citizens buying massrs (drumroll) china white labeling / rebranding , random grandmas making clothe ones (this 4 months deep)

Im nurse hospital sanitizer whiskey distillery awhile.

Im glad fellow citizens stepping inappropriate even so. 2 months late, americans still going around like nothing? Bout time. see you‚Äôve worked Walmart. Or, like me, least witnessed bizarre morning pep rally. mentality caused ShakeShack Kanye take PPP money. 

I'm tired speculators asking handout luck goes south. give money back rental rates go up, get money rental rates go down? three B's Trump administration: **Bluffing, Bullying, Blaming**.  going interesting. Around here, people wear masks stores. I'd guesstimate 90-95% people see wearing masks. 

Except WalMart. There, elderly customers wear masks. younger people? hit miss. I'd say 50% customers wear masks WalMart. 

Just last week saw woman freak get WalMart via specific door locked 10 am. 9:55 am. screaming sign said ""Entrance"" store legally obligated let door immediately. 

There door 50 feet away could entered without problem. 

So I'm curious woman ilk take mandatory mask order. 

And let's get many WalMart employees customers wear masks correctly. Nope, probably, certainly Restart already ffs sustainable I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm saying people sub really like inflating egos opportunity get. feel like, may learned something conversation. post links sources, words carry weight people take seriously.

The swearing insults end strengthen case made look rather stupid, tbh. would better post links beginning, could policy discussion instead insult party. Even reason curb-side (not masks). entitled believe that. entire scientific community thinks wrong ""I'm contagious."" Every sick person ever. Freedom contract Deadly virus. Pray don‚Äôt spread family One one, states fall line hospitals become overwhelmed people die. 

Except Florida Arizona. Sad stories many people good needlessly dying day? SMH. walmart employees, okay tell f** karen fuck off. opinion one biggest problems America fact Americans never leave see countries cultures. partially leads idiocy thinking government health care can‚Äôt done doesn‚Äôt work even though it‚Äôs norm every first world country.  crazy people say ""research yourself"" really mean, watch dumb videos YouTube another crazy person believe ""evidence"" stop listening liburul scientists.  ""without taking precautions"" 'We'll go Facebook/Snapchat/TikTok friends lists....alright that's ten thousand people need call.' Omg sounds like introverted wet dream. love social distancing since pandemic. #socialdistancinghipster Minnesota Walmart‚Äôs (my Walmart least) started third party security patrolling entrances well. Nothing intrusive noticeable enough won‚Äôt ‚Äúnew‚Äù they‚Äôre asked start enforcing this. Bit late aint makes exactly 25, half US states mask requirement!

This could solved automation technology (probably relatively trivial do). Straight up, Walmart someone management realized continue force employees work dangerous conditions maskless shoppers lots workers getting corona, employees finally going get nationwide labor union movement going. sub renamed /communism point. need body cams Walmart security guys. We'll capture wealth great interactions. subjective interpretation based data It‚Äôs super confusing well. don‚Äôt follow news much reddit aware wearing mask starting February haven‚Äôt stopped. didn‚Äôt know become politicized close friend R political views tried start argument stopped help fix trailer. blew away.

Yup, roughly half America reaction, too. places mask compliance reasonable, huge swaths country masks almost unheard of. Still.  
 
I drove (rural) Oklahoma past weekend. would estimate **at best** 10% people wore masks. weirdo getting looks wearing mine. Never mind exponential growth rate cases. Never mind governor news conference morning announce infected. *still* proudly tweets takes family sit-down restaurants *still* defiantly says never institute state-wide mask rule. 
 
So, America far? We've fucking royally. still fucking bad. There's sugar-coating it. levels, literally worst possible decisions made. So, yes, we're screwed. half population want acknowledge it. I‚Äôve trying explain people ... don‚Äôt understand people willing risk killing family member. live that?

The dad 42 ventilator 15 days means he‚Äôs unlikely make it. word conditions, likely life cut way short this. It‚Äôs fucking tragic Nothing learn USA, keep thang! Walmart we're talking about. Looking forward seeing videos!

No, low wage employees shouldnt ones dealing trigger happy tools emptying clip them. 

Keep thinking way do.  Every worker I‚Äôve interacted super nice, accommodating seemed genuine every interaction. saw tapping iPad entrance asked grabbing data mask vs non mask. Turned internal stats customers in.

I'm Canadian we're required wear mask interior public spaces. fully support it. wisdom know know everything sometimes anything take knowledge others. think repeatedly poked eye would massive improvement people get repeatedly kicked balls, consider either outcome good.

It always worse, ever let people use convince things good aren't.

I'm sorry, I'm hungry/angry right long day. I‚Äôm OC first answer pretty telling hell would this. Basically, weird anti-maskers want something hang hat send kids weird/fringe schools won‚Äôt require it. would shocked public mainstream private(we lots really big Christian private schools here) didn‚Äôt require masks.

Again board zero authority school districts. would make recommendation, don‚Äôt know. even exist, don‚Äôt know. kinda pointless already let walk around infecting people. rural areas real grocery store Walmart. Based article, looks like they'll giving complimentary masks Sam's Clubs Walmarts they're still ""considering different solutions customers"". started turning people away doors today without warning, it'd proper shitshow. least gives chance mitigate prep inevitable problems. country stupid can't tell posts serious sarcastic anymore. reading this, reminded early praise Cali got compared NY. also reminded praise certain news channel heaped Florida Texas reopened. Basically I'm cautious praising area early. 

That said, Illinois seems well recently recent cases per capita one sixth Florida's per capita number. It' still larger NY's though. seems working, easy get complacent effort erased. Masks required every public indoor space Toronto week now. Good times. starts next week. Nah, fan conflicts interest involved interface pharma government. assume cases it‚Äôs year born, prefix part name want already taken words, cherry pick science data like. results well conducted study don‚Äôt fit narrative, dispute science.

Even though raw case number Arizona look like plateauing, would indicate result decrease covid spread instead means Arizona hit testing capacity. getting fully picture Arizona right now, probably won‚Äôt get death numbers.

Swap jail weed want actively endanger humans pandemics. might bring extra cell phone start recording time I‚Äôm store Oh shit problem locals refuse police it.

You can‚Äôt say virus control USA. 

Be smart follow gut feeling. gives stress, keep kids home. Better everyone then. Blue dream... Kind depend mean vulnerable. Everyone agrees elderly need safe possible, younger people obese, higher risk suffer complications? 40% US population obese. Even elderly perfectly sheltered, lift restrictions exponential growth still enough hospitalizations completely overwhelm system.  Yep, I‚Äôm Winnipeg there‚Äôs currently law wearing masks. majority people see don‚Äôt wear them. Tom Waits' Swordfishtrombones popped head, little rearranging fits:

The mainstream conservative talking points downplay virus, effectiveness masks, claim whole thing liberal conspiracy make people compliant, etc  shit. 

I don‚Äôt know masks portrayed population benefit lookout people. 

At minimum, partial protective impact wearer whole water wet debate made complex point nothing makes sense anymore. People bringing science whole issue mostly simplistic language logic issue.

Technically speaking, water molecules everywhere atmosphere, always surrounded water. make every object wet?  weird people pro cop here. Lot racists guess. Keep mind Walmarts specific enforcement mask requirement weak. customer says health condition, religious reason, age exemption, let questions. 

If give reason, also let in, inform member management inform law enforcement. law enforcement willing respond, nothing done. customer free shop.

Yes does, every county US dating back mid-March. Click state county cases/fatality graphs change show county level data. Broward shows zero 7/13, 7/14, 7/15. illustrated point, Spanish Flu thought originate US. WWI ending time, countries involved WWI (the war end wars...until next war) want report flu deaths.

When Spain started reporting new type disease, got labeled Spanish Flu. I'm train well, work home anyways could go forever. anyone honestly believes prevents Covid spreading would Thought Japan would better.

We've wearing masks chins *decades* unknown reason

It's unknown all. Trump get ahead literally anything issue, turned real issue, come it, proclaiming big deal, since initial stance idiots follow him, changes stance based anyone else says, would show growth, unacceptable. way pick whatever stance everyone else stubbornly adhere stance matter new information introduced. losing mind this. wrong. evil. 


And I'm sure many folks living dictatorships upset unhealthy censorship prevalent nations. Bad deeds abroad justify bad deeds domestic. vice versa. MUH LIBERTY Honestly stopped talking her. can't see 2 PARENTS ONE ELSE father source income right now, life. honestly hope mom youngest sibling catches COVID realizes bad actually worn fucking mask. sincerely hope so! doubt, also logic lockdown everything accelerated spread number worst.

Lifted, places.

Folks rural America Facebook brainwashed believing fake overplayed. know rural Americans, hard comprehend they're seeing. Pure propaganda pages share friends social activity, talk in-person. fucking insane.

EDIT: clarity, mean PARTICULARLY rural America, limited folks It‚Äôs insane every state isn‚Äôt requiring masks places business.  people spread vulnerable populations definitely realize it, yes. short pharma stocks? Hopefully this'll get corrected visitors wear masks too. don‚Äôt say often people test positive shortness breath symptom? thank God leadership Governor Whitmer. would letter power, Michigan would worse Florida Arizona right now. little late American. 

* Facepalm * Exactly child home. Every parent think like me. get virus control, home. people think everything hoax. Well family playing game them. use guinea pigs. Maybe people come positive antibodies? Karen much Follow-up headline, probably August:

""Hundreds test positive COVID-19 going Missouri house part hundreds attendance"" town Illinois wearing awhile. Well anyway, mandated governor though, that's probably why. I'd love able work home. $work old school, ""build stuff"" doubt would happen unless things got very, bad. got point, work would probably high priority list. look order many exceptions ridiculous  apply science relevant knowledge new situations course knowledge expands decisions findings may need changing along road.

Calling opinion like anyone relevant opinion matter justice people like Fauci.

It's like there's specific number years start calling something science :') people creates precedent industry standard definitely helps legality lawsuits, 

Industry standards actually important taking account whats considered reasonable.

And doubt thats true Vegas Atlantic city March 2020, EEOC declared COVID-19 pandemic meets direct threat standard, based guidance CDC public health authorities regarding risk community spread institution restrictions

Based precedent reason place shut now. direct threat standard ADA exception blanket used. Agree industry standard currently know. sort get it. mid-July I've two days vacation year. cancelled everything else covid. vacation scheduled end year realistically, that's going get cancelled too. cooped four walls year long unable leave kind like prison. get people want get away it. Leicester? point quite advertent. know risks continuing stupid selfish behavior already fda aproved. new drug. test hospitals today wanted.  *WTF?!* START NOW?! WRONG USA? 15 day wait MI going relatives Christmas year. exposed got one due that. normally need symptoms need know exposed. Thank god it‚Äôs 3 weeks since supposed exposure symptoms, company making work since 14 day quarantine hope I‚Äôm asymptomatic, however, would unlikely me, wife, two kids, elderly mother use occasional child care asymptomatic. Many do. I've seen cops city go far spraying sanitizer gas pumps. I've got problems law enforcement whole you, dicks sake it.

And Walmart paying overtime gig, certainly stipulate does. Haha. needed study suggest this? 
And another note, love statements say ""may""... Okay, said nothing. Coming place near soon... special security team enforcement. done long time ago Maybe he‚Äôs hoping Democrats get virus? Honestly life sounds better without them. Stupid stupid does. People learn unless make them. sounds like type makes bad decisions family let her. condone bad decision making people, eventually learn. family knows, even adult, act like one, place life. condone bad behavior children, adults? Whoever lawmaker Florida CNN last segment was, infuriating.

I see going national TV argue mask mandate. dumb, IMO, whatever, going body autonomy personal rights whatever, okay, fine.

But argue things Florida going perfectly fine beyond stupid. living embodiment dog ""This fine"" meme, sitting smiling room fire around him. know, \*just\* masks become political - ENTIRE ecosphere surrounding COVID-19 multiverse. know difficult believe, truly case delusional political gaslighting. Republicans waited long enough see base came issue virus precautions, sided (because politicians side base - completely unprincipled).

Donald Trump (sorry, call ""the President"") want stock market crash lot insider trading since day came office making billions, uses frontotemporal-dementia smoke screen wax lyrical word salad every time speaks COVID (""It'll go away....it'll like miracle......it's mostly harmless......"").

When this, followers listen, inject insanity right-wing psychoses everyday lives ""it's cool"" (also bending country far right next hundred years Supreme Court lower courts - even agree necessarily stance virus, - right-wing religious nutjobs make least \~35% population - know best interests agree genuflect points anyways), and.......here find ourselves.

Also American public one under-educated populaces westernized world.

Also war science since W. office. Oh no, mark beast. surprised start seeing prayer groups big circles throughout lots Walmarts (w/out masks course) praying god come quickly take away leaving mask wearers behind. walmart NY put biggest dude greeter face mask started required. Yes states require certain diseases legally notifiable them. states, diseases like HIV, TB many foodborne diseases STD's also notifiable. also rules time period must reported within i.e. within 2 weeks. example, [This explains infection disease reporting Illinois kinds chronic infectious diseases, references legislation well. Every single walmart i've ever greeter. YIKES. Karen run, Darwin catches end. Outdoors close contact, players wearing masks times? Much different protests. understand frustration, want results, may time new strategy: asking questions really understand concerns behind reluctance take precautions. understanding, able advice effectively. 

Also, consider getting pack surgical masks, comfortable - doctors use hours. Magnets Pardon fuckin 'plan' that? *Suits* suits? Like slacks jacket? like black shirt tactical pants? Masks mandatory indoor public spaces city. So, open everything up, close hospitals, one wear masks except fringe people, get everyone within six feet other? 99+% non figure except within specific parameters age, fitness level frequency exposure occupation. 

You want real work?

You want actually read data talk problems scope experiment design?

Then I‚Äôll get horse.

Selfish nonsense. 

This isn‚Äôt anyone thinks it‚Äôs data says. Walmarts countries? Even press release specify. keep seeing things masks ‚Äúnow‚Äù required. seen anyone allowed store business without mask since April Problem CDC, WHO, Fauci, 100s doctors giving opinions don‚Äôt line up. say X others say Y. public discourse runs gamut.

Now doctors saying keep schools closed others say open up. 

There 3.7mm FT teachers US - even counting professionals administrators would building. 

There tests cover them. wrong you? Racist piece shit go play highway I'll tell friends small towns western IL. We'll good laugh. (Though work Walmart warehouse wince laughing causes pain various injuries.)

Thanks! guess bouncers handle drunk idiots probably intentionally spit throw direction handle fine. like 100% RN?

How bad would get? Probably reason NY times published one Tom Cotton Let's prevent deaths people killing them, genius. gets water boarded? bad hope r/policebrutality content, too? mask deniers pretty slow could use encouragement. amazes difficult people understand asymptomatic spread. encounter every day. 7 months ... concept even 3rd grader understand. walmart required masks since beginning may.

Or cripple economy.

Scenario 1: properly shut reach right level sanitary measures virus curve kept low, contract tracing reality, vaccine developed. Businesses reopen within months everyone back normal foundation relatively preserved due efforts.

Scenario 2: Sacrifice people economy, still end weakened economy people dying becoming crippled. vaccine made, least 10% care-free spending consumers dead, workforce community lifelong health issues.

Gotta go scenario 2 ~~indignant outrage notion paying people working~~ crocodile tears poor people suffering whilst restrict unemployment assistance deserve it, really [self-centered proud wear Sounds like parks need resources enforcement protection. record I'm saying work hard, apply (I even know you), I'm saying deserve better. I‚Äôm curious got hit information from. Care share? promise catch like United States  Florida. forgiven did, different parts. finally lol one London wears masks Making fun racist people saying something racist? Sure, symptoms. I've gotten tested twice though proactive even though I've never symptoms (and ultimately negative), full ""quarantining"" took test. I'd asymptomatic, long delay would've meant would risk spreading it. I've looked extensively immigration requirements Canada. 

If in-demand transferable skill spare $22,000 lying around... bother. even two weeks. fiance tested positive Friday, telling back Friday. One week enough, guess, work understaffed hospital...especially one even tell exposed Corona positive patient once, fucking Walter reed military hospital, probably got talked it, would‚Äôve extremely bad optics. hasn‚Äôt worn one since. Walmart requires everyone wear masks they're going need gun checks people enter. friend SoCal (where live) waited 10 days (got results last week). sincerely hope gets faster seem like us right One issues hospitals transitioning patients Covid wards nursing homes / medical rehab facilities, etc requires negative test. 
I think comes labor quantity machines/reagents. I‚Äôd bet running 24/7 full speed.

Yup definitely agree. Also, don‚Äôt forget corporatist media outlets, appealing different crowd, upper middle class - pushing anecdotal, overblown misleading fear porn validates lockdowns use tiny contingent anti-maskers scapegoat keeping lockdowns place. surprised CARES Act gets extended another $1-2T gets transferred upwards expense working class. wear mask, heres I'm telling yall.

He told started requiring masks, said ""prime entertainment"" watching ""these entitled pricks"" freak out. What? Still isn't? Lmao Honestly, big problem IMMEDIATELY google words understand, people choose confusion lieu option confuse me. I'm skeptical.

I know people definitely intelligent, also think masks social distancing ridiculous.

I'd wear mask minimize risk. amount anti-union messages Wal-Mart‚Äôs ‚Äútraining‚Äù absurd. would assume it‚Äôs gotten worse since years there. wear mask drinking beer bar? stare it?

üç∫ üëÄ üò∑ 

This sub fucking funny talking about? high forgot pills? comments make absolut sense. They‚Äôre still there...it‚Äôs they‚Äôre torn whether spending justified this. little late mandated MONTHS ago We'll see many result death run hospital beds really need better term virus like herd immunity masses consume understand. immunity implies never get illness again, looking unlikely. mean better equipped handle virus second time. saying way avoid confusion help future, especially antiscience crowd. Apparently crazy friend Cuomo never heard food chain

Edit: Getting downvoted Simpsons reference, response Simpsons reference episode. Unusual turn events reddit There's gonna violence. guarantee it. way ignorant selfish conservative Walmart shoppers gonna freak fuck they're told put mask leave. I'm guessing read article. like outright refusing anything. assured family everything right, maybe part. fucked going friend's house removing mask, mom consistently reminded him, agreed, can't follow around like toddler. know that, referencing anti-mask person stabbed man seventies telling wear mask. us American's deserve think he's US Floridian checking - see 30% compliance. live close KSC, Hicksville. Chattanoogan here. promise us taking seriously. enough, unfortunately. idea executive stock plans work prescheduled sales. 

Just keep mind. Cant imagine Karens going wild. wearing mask issuing mask mandate really punctuates seriousness. neck woods that's better factory jobs 5 years raises. anti maskers still there. I've seen people take damn masks off/slip around chin throat costco get little ways inside beyond employees shop costco without mask assume put back checkouts. dumb work around... US, propably not... requirement since April - I'll go now. ...and let shitshow begin. 

Also, TIME. Welcoming Karens line manager's office, please stand single file. never properly enforced. went target day signs front saying masks required, plus entire state California requiring masks, people walking left right without them, people store without them. end day, theyre gonna protect margin first. First, Italy's death toll ten times higher. Per capita Italy's death toll ten times higher. Even per confirmed infection Italy's death toll ten times higher. 

Second, either exaggerating headlines getting headlines bad source. 

Third, America larger less dense population results slower spread, still upswing part pandemic outbreaks asynchronous. Texas Florida overwhelmed mean country is. Gravy Seals? Well skin collection organic molecules. Adding water status quo collection makes wet removing makes dry. actually inadvertently proving right. takes molecules different types allow something less water making less wet. 100% water makes wet can't less 100% add water becomes thing wet water self. What's crazy go wal-mart hours, almost everybody wearing masks, go peak hours, almost nobody is. 

I saw transition day unreal-- went around 4-430, almost everybody wearing masks. time leaving around 5:15, pretty much everybody coming maskless. Almost like mandatory 4 months ago mean, switch ""freedom"" ""prison population"", dead on. Southern Illinois handle well. /s 67 tested  HELL YES I‚Äôm curious see they‚Äôve losing customers biggest competitors like Costco. feel far safer shopping Walmart since pandemic started. Walmart hasn‚Äôt gotten money since March. Thank kind words.

So totally won‚Äôt happen! /s Seems like overkill. Except restaurants Airbnb, already closed question receiving test results.

On July 9 (Thursday) went CVS drive-through testing. everything done, person told would get results back 3 days. told check email follow instructions there. 

The email told link Minute Clinic Chart. saw appointment day. figured today would results.

Even without virus...emmigrating Europe difficult unless marry right, educated independent enough leave everything study kid, get highly sought degree get job every applicant Europe...which takes years $100K here... could take Syrian refugee plan I'd sign now. Yup, part LA super consistent mask usage well. 99.9% indoor mask compliance I‚Äôd say 60-70% even walking sidewalk wearing mask. thread pointless. Chinareddit simply ban anyone drop knees surrender freedom.

P.S. Anyone find interesting Wal-Mart stay open mom pop small businesses forced close? Oh hell, fuckers care. That's government punishing Trump voters. Since America relevant ask chins? I‚Äôm means excusing Trump/Feds, state, local, responses absolutely pitiful well. Complete failure top bottom. Also people South say ‚Äúnortherners‚Äù, generally mean people old Union states. I‚Äôve bizarre discussions southerners told Los Angeles residents Yankees even though Los Angeles center ‚ÄúNorthern‚Äù American culture. Eh? /r/ActualPublicFreakouts yet see one story explanation Sweden drastically improved past week. read ever really went lockdown we've state (Alabama). hit really high numbers, started falling drastically. seem better anyone. herd immunity virus mutating, possible explanations case? mass uncurbed infections support reelection? That‚Äôs part I‚Äôm missing. relying economy solely basis re-election nothing else matters? I'm picturing bunch retail workers banding together like Spartans 300 pushing Karens Billy Bobs. 

All jokes aside, gonna rough them. So, friend feeding constant stream anti-vax information. Regarding lack liability companies vaccines cause harm, increase number vaccines children get amount money earned vaccines since changes made decades ago.

Point is, agree, giving corporations opportunities make money without fear liability problem. run-a-way profits growth vaccine industry likely result decisions made many years ago. However, using reason justify resistance vaccinations short sighted and, blunt, ignorant.

I remember covered calamine lotion kid taking oatmeal baths deal unbelievable itchiness chicken pox. Something two children never deal with. Whooping cough, measles, mumps, polio, etc. issues children never deal with.

Do think Covid vaccinations rushed? Yes, absolutely. Anyone says differently simply lying. really choice matter? really. something done. would done way regardless running department team on. single important vaccination companies worked decades. place faith something, point. 

I find strange, many question much happened last months easily believe consume least founded. But, easily dismiss supported. Character assassination (Fauci Birx got program), casting doubt dismissal CDC data competency acceptance outlier one studies consensus studies cultivate ideas masks spread virus. 


What even stranger ability narratives unwilling see directly assist causes support accusing alternative view using information selfish desires toppling power, etc. Armed anti mask idiots that.

My gun nut neighbor already implying mask tyrannical constitution gave us guns protect tyranny... asked you? infringing right die!!! Hope gets repealed else hear lawyers think majority Trump fans. agree many dumb not. Well go well. don‚Äôt foresee criticisms problems this. mean, fauci even impeached once. that's gotta mean something IpHoNe.... 
My uncle swears Apple products completely immune kind hacking/tracking/storing info none 150 apps anything either. iPhone completely safe unlike damn Androids completely unsafe. God, please tell Hell horrible beyond imagination eternal guy‚Äôs earned stay. Underrated comment right people made decision (and good one) slide right position greeter. Try shoes bit.  I'm surprised article says pre-existing conditions. definitely overweight. shame people spreading article far wide show people important masks social distancing are, instead trolls attacking facebook page. people assholes assholes. people trolls. Others depressed. seemed like first based comments.

Don‚Äôt worry, still think you‚Äôre asshole things wrote. However, believe people change also believe depression serious disease deserve find way it. Maybe change outlook topics like this. Either way, good luck there. get tested exposing people. test negative, whoopdie doo missed couple days school. test positive congrats saved exposing countless people virus. *again* literally nobody could expect happen.   Nice video, needed say ICU stays much longer average. I'm one unlucky ones parents think hoax. distance wear masks that's problem, think serious. argument social group got virus widespread, flu kills people yearly, government faking numbers ruin economy.


I want start arguing words done seem potent enough. wanna hit question sentence convince facts. Somebody please help me. Words hard. causes permanent organ damage including heart brain damage. Clearly can't afford loss cognitive function. Wear mask. statewide crying loud. County county level makes confusing Imagine praying god released virus also fix it. Fuck dumb religions get people killed deflect scientific facts rely fairy tales. Rince repeat..... Next! Chinese virus, CCP-style statistical methods. /s I'd like beer him. comfortable wearing mask daily live privelige due color skin. Others fortunate. openly admit public wants unknown lethal virus rip them... Covid Karen Coven. Trump minions like this. Wait... snow man?!!? really mate, racist scared black people Well safe hear

This definitely way go, places need say ""If medical condition preventing wearing mask certainly die COVID catch may held liable ask leave."" overstep infringes upon property rights business owners ability individuals make health decisions,

Again see prioritization greed human life.

Again see call right harm others.

You absolute right profit. right harm others. Wear damn mask get pandemic control selfish bastard. WAR PEACE

FREEDOM SLAVERY 

IGNORANCE **IS** STRENGTH I‚Äôve heard areas call public health dept. anonymously report. sure would anything it, it‚Äôs something. Friggin' rednecks. Essex County well. think part juvenile upstate vs downstate thing, downstate controlled dems decades. Part also ""muh guns"", ""muh taxes"". Also, think getting rid environmental labor rules automatically make business flourish put tiny towns back map. didnt know 108 million people job. Also considering less 0.01% people cornovirus world youre going man acting like there's commerce going all. muh free money please. think stop taking shrooms Sorry, said ""you said"" meant say ""the original commenter said"" everything else said still holds. seem addressed lack quotation intervening irrelevant comment. So... back issue hand. unreasonable point saying everyone protesting BLM ""stupid"" fairly racially charged least?

You claimed unreasonable leap, want know why. yet responded wonder is... cmon, devices made keep alive, kill you. Doesn‚Äôt Walmart facial recognition database shoplifters?

Just wait Facebook sells database WM could probably apply FMLA need resign needing time without fear job loss.. Might something consider. English second language? spelling high list doctors priorities? Biden's platform influence AOC Bernie likely ""most centrist"" canidate they've run. Hahaha that‚Äôs amazing someone write them, technologies like Nike's FlyEase reasonable solution people type disabilities? people adapting new reality. Face shields cheap buy online, idea pushed part PPE package.  Listen CDC brainlessly like sheep, think yourself. I'm registered democrat supported Sanders. misrepresenting situation attention. ordering hospitals exclude CDC comply even minimize legal risk... say CDC getting whole picture.

Even small percentage stop reporting claim made CDC's interpretation compromised. That's goal.

If hospitals protest sending numbers new agency claim nobody knows real statistics. Also, sudden unannounced change like this..do expect hospitals able switch procedures fast? fumble even meant comply. thinking thing wait really?? true, absolutely believe source see (not trying rude anything) ready lots new Karen's, thugs, MAGA. 

They hooping hollering. Threatening throw down. draw line preventing spread pandemic vaccine method combating restricting droplet contact. vaccine likely ready widespread distribution next year. 

And, yes, move schools online fall season. otherwise going teachers school staff quitting droves killed infected children.  *Canada enters chat* There‚Äôs many studies suggesting can‚Äôt also need empowered job. position looks sidelined seriously undermined. They‚Äôve basically shut able access president press. isolates renders unable recommend policies would help health care workers, direct initiatives, recommend funnel resources fight Covid, inform public state pandemic. 

He staying role significantly minimized detriment public good. It‚Äôs pity, it‚Äôs criminal. It‚Äôs like ordering firefighters stay firehouse fires burning. Reminds scene ‚ÄúAnd Band Played On‚Äù scientists discovered HIV blood supply executives charge blood supply nothing: doctor asking board room full them: many deaths okay? 10? 100? 1000, 10,000? 10 million?‚Äù nope, continued nothing, many people got transfusions got AIDS died. Needlessly. death loved one, cherished many üò£ I've seen tourists resort places like Cun wearing masks all, like, think they're beach they're going get infected? blows mind Rose bowl usually PAC 12 champ vs Big 10 champ, conferences already said ""no conference games"" whole season.

I'm feeling like that's going translate bowl season cancelled, playoffs cancelled. Hell, really think we're even gonna season rate. Ok... course .... living decades... wait minute... way.... taking Trump! Real americans salute you! Carry ""desperately need haircut"" even mean? professional appearance rule? safety thing, hair nets hair ties able handle it. personal comfort thing?

I'm trying dismissive, I've heard multiple people, know means. office normally professional appearance rules, relaxed made fun game it. seems like times embrace wild hair, others. Yeah, kidding. [cheer  someone jogging, someone working gym. think getting saying virus terrible? can't fathom anything without trying get something themselves. guess it‚Äôs good thing isn‚Äôt deadly many aren‚Äôt concerned all, oh well  Yeah think goes ‚Äúpeople intelligent realize socially distance‚Äù  sooner? 2 weeks recommended quarantine period. 

Do really think 65 year old man probably best shape age risk factors going recover quickly? South Bay- folks street they're usually walking exercising solo like give benefit doubt hope mask getting near folks. yeah, numbers control. freaky. Hope able stay safe there! Oh man weekend going spent watching videos shitshow!

Needed happen though. get saying, going back school delaying that. month schools open scenario anyway, also tons parents dead leading single parent households leave children orphaned. see anyone think good idea person classes fall all. live SoCal LA county voted online learning, Orange County's education board right next voted 4-1 open campuses, they're going social distancing require masks either. hate country. confirmed cases reinfection you‚Äôre stressing thinking otherwise man right wanker mate I'm pretty sure they're incapable that. Remember every state cuomo gets point there's good options left.  could LIBERATE MICHIGAN! two months March 16 til third week May. Came back LA time shit show. 

They decent job Taiwan. put quarantine two weeks. took local cel phone numbers used track us; basically left house, we‚Äôd get polite firm text go home. local administrator would come check us; police would call us. also brought us food case needed it, well masks isopropyl alcohol. also paid us $30 per day. 

We‚Äôd watch news quite bit. daily press conferences covid task force. They‚Äôd talk case numbers, breakouts, even tips mask usage (like rice cooker thing.) saw outbreaks would happen days they‚Äôd identify places visited, contacts, efforts contain. knew cases imported community spread. 

Once quarantine got go live normal life again. 90% people street wore masks; required public transport. workers stationed outside turnstiles subway reminding people wear masks. Shops restaurants open, would check temperature spritz isopropyl. Business clearly down, things open. Social pressure also pretty strong; everyone worked together make sure mask compliance high. Buy high. 

It wasn‚Äôt perfect system, could see holes it. didn‚Äôt need perfect get results Taiwan did. parents still there; want come home, they‚Äôre homesick, dad‚Äôs health wasn‚Äôt great it‚Äôs best stay (he‚Äôs actually lot better now, seeing doctors improving.)

Contrast US. landed LaX virtually change border control process. signs encouraged social distancing. But, outside that... temperature checks (did least three Incheon), questionnaires, quarantine, masks, nothing. fact, probably fastest ever coasted thru customs ever. Unreal. solid bet lol. Even highly effective save face they'll probably approve one.

 
But evidence seems point fact indeed working vaccine come late fall. will. are, still need workers there. workers community getting exposed like everyone else. Head store without mask bar friends day governor says it‚Äôs okay. Then, days later got tickle back throat usually get allergies anyway, otherwise feel fine, they‚Äôre going go work think nothing it‚Äôs late. 

From there, takes one absent-minded rub eye quick hand wash, boom, spreads. staff support main mega-yacht live disturb presence. Darwin fail. He‚Äôs already reproduced passed dumbass genes progeny.  feel helpless, watching country turning into. It‚Äôs in-person learning. McMaster saying 5 days per week face face school virtual learning. allow hybrid plans face face. school district already spent months coming plan reopening schools scrap whole thing.  Came basically say thing. Take worldometers page. lot US state level info comes state portals directly, CDC. ~~If~~ HHS starts ""adjusting"" data, feeling start showing pretty quickly.

The unfortunate side cult current administration start ignore numbers HHS make anti-maskers ""it's big deal"" people even worse. guy doctor af. Literally, initials Dr. AF. That's pretty bad ass. Oh know coming, everyone thinks well spike. takes one careless idiot we'll next hot zone; strict lockdown right away. sums anti-mask movement right here. hope cause scene. Nope... Young people know EXACTLY they're doing. state legislature embarrassment. need many useless bodies Harrisburg beyond me. Pretty soon nearly stores #^^^^^^ü•∂ muh freeedum added thought school...there reason can‚Äôt make calendar year...Go October July November August. Can't wait see people Walmart. new flu virus. powers letting fools freak bankrupt become dependent them. So, question, know viruses existed last march? considered quarantine test results state pay stay home it. Exactly... wearing n95s back March government body requiring (we live California many n95s already, wildfires). clearly see need benefit masks own! political statement. start now? mumps, chicken pox, measles kid. warrior immune system **STONKS** That's point... virus even worse Fall Winter. breaking records right suffering biggest natural enemy. Brazil getting decimated end think India's going hit hardest leave poor employees enforce. don‚Äôt hire security enforce it? Alabama put mask order.

Orders much population rejects masks law enforcement fails enforce said orders. Smith County (Tyler, East Texas) come straight said enforce order. War Reality

Good thing pay dime personally, since 2 auspicious countries good job footing get wrong, exploiting vulnerability requires vulnerability exist first place. clearly premeditated malevolent action economic (sanctions) military consequences. Virginia, USA.  I'm sure entirely agree case argument often Universal Masking arbitrary restriction personal liberty. put number it, longer arbitrary. suppose number could counties 1 active case 4, may thinking.

Some countries (and states?) use color coded [alert closures insure things done arbitrarily. current level closure objectively linked number cases per 100,000 positivity rate. Still don't. US is, different way, failing people. Dr. Fauci exactly type person refuse resign middle job. pandemic probably retire beats shit.

An example us all. seems little high based fact TX currently 6k deaths average year (as couple weeks ago lag), still even 3x current official covid count. confusing people Florida. Plantation city Broward County, Florida.  He‚Äôs already reproduced. Half us still care. We're bright. shame Emergency room doctors must getting stressed impossible choices treatment menu. list grows daily. 

I'm curious too, doctors suggesting prescribing home treatment (for ill hospitalized). hear breakthroughs severely ill, never beep ill-at-home. you‚Äôre going sick tired 

I mean see, can't say warn you. right! better hope not. Literally saw post day anti masker kept saying ""you believe facts want ill believe facts want"" person kept trying inform facts debate, either true fact opinion facts. still get it, living start 1984 depressing. ""the science evolved"" - defense people take flip flop masks. science evolve. there. Asian countries familiar SARS/MERS outbreaks already putting masks COVID19 showed up. part best practices recommended Wuhan. science evolve, Fauci evolved interpretation it. watch proudly Italy! lot people don‚Äôt like Nicola they‚Äôre unionist. wonder they‚Äôre slowly waking up. Parts hardest hit areas take pandemic seriously New York. learned nothing squandered months spent lockdown. Now, starting multiple hotspots. Even live governor took seriously initially got numbers down, people taking precautions. Face masks maybe half times stores. People going amusement parks parties. lockdown lifted, people acted like lockdown over.  Bullshit! time get mask, many TikTok videos make. Chinese surveillance team get bored otherwise! try cancelling corona probably norovirus, it‚Äôs obviously deadly COVID it‚Äôs one unpleasant illnesses there, would strongly urge stay home stomach flu symptoms (including diarrhea) gone least 3 days Slap face health care workers. Time hospital workers go strike. hire security, allow Walmart employees able deal influx Karen‚Äôs jobs too. 6 weeks? get major ilnesses might needed, 6 weeks US people would scam it.

Now 6 weeks doctor recommendation sure. ya, 6 weeks worth ""calling sick"" would wreck businesses. Children American civil war soldiers still exists

Unfortunately, lot people convinced sick. last time went walmart (few weeks ago) greeter wearing dangling one ear. reinforced love curbside pickup. imply commerce going on, imply 108 million people jobs. talk unemployment I'm talking work force. Real unemployment US covid hovered 25-30%.

Online schools prepare KIDS better NEW NORMAL anyhow! Fail plan , plan fail..simple thought already done month ago, might thinking Costco. Oh well never mind lol Technically, responding type response.

YEAR !!! Nono live Norway dude. people can't drive lane correctly walk sole right direction, they're wearing masks. Muh freedums Oh, now? even covid19 testers paid well. Actually shut Spanish Flu. several plans mitigation. literally live city originated from. Lol 

And fact, less medical advancements understanding disease. Covid awful it‚Äôs gunna blow us sooner rather later point. Even dwindle down, means trace contact systems become easier manage. 

Every government world wants thing gone fast possible. 7th mask breaker. Ah, no. NYC invaded upstate New York. 

Even so, proves point New Yorkers (City) LAers believe rest country expendable. Richie Rich. packed gym today, seen many packed bars pubs last two months. sorry break started curbside this, it‚Äôs best! new habits I‚Äôve picked up, going one lasts long COVID gone. Imagine working supporting Walmart? thanks. American would blame country letting us in. hear you. USA seam forgotten middle pandemic. next month thing going explode go back re-closing everything. time manager bad mouthing acting ignorant people.

Toxic cultures breed toxic cultures. huge issue Walmart's corporate culture emphasizes no-excuse performance metrics always increase, focusing almost completely in-house promotions management. new ideas, new focus, means they're stuck cycle unending toxic culture. 

Crab mentality serious display.  debating one nutters Instagram, using actual facts eventually responses started talking ""they"" ""use fear control us"" mortality figures lies.

It's easier get people put tinfoil hat face covering. Yah good. FL trucked along 1k new cases new day weeks, thought would never get worse. top 8 countries world deaths/capita European.

Because major economy, US suffers, world also suffers economically. worrying everywhere. I'm worried losing home rate people wearing masks ocean away. make shit guess. Walmarts without curbside pickup... B cell response SARS-CoV2 infection remains poorly understood. studies suggest overaggressive immune response leading immunopathology (51) whereas others suggest cell exhaustion dysfunction (12‚Äì14). Autopsies revealed high virus levels respiratory tract tissues (52), suggesting ineffective immune responses. Nevertheless, non-hospitalized subjects recovered COVID-19 evidence virus-specific cell memory (53). SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies also found convalescent subjects patients currently treated convalescent plasma therapy (30, 54). However, COVID-19 ICU patients SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies (30), raising question patients antibody responses controlling disease. general, studies report single patients small cohorts comprehensive deep immune profiling large number COVID-19 hospitalized patients limiting. knowledge would address critical question whether common profile immune dysfunction critically ill patients. data would also help guide testing therapeutics enhance, inhibit, otherwise tailor immune response COVID-19 patients.

To interrogate immune response patterns COVID-19 hospitalized patients, studied cohort ~125 COVID-19 patients. used high dimensional flow cytometry perform deep immune profiling individual B cell populations, temporal analysis immune changes infection, combined profiling extensive clinical data understand relationships immune responses SARS-CoV2 disease severity. Using approach, made several key findings. First, defining feature COVID-19 disease hospitalized patients heterogeneity immune response. Many COVID-19 patients displayed robust CD8 cell and/or CD4 cell activation proliferation PB responses, though considerable subgroup patients (~20%) minimal detectable response compared controls. Furthermore, even within patients mounted detectable B cell responses COVID-19 disease, immune characteristics response heterogeneous. deep immune profiling, identified three immunotypes hospitalized COVID-19 patients including: (1) patients robust activation proliferation CD4 cells, relative lack cTfh, together modest activation TEMRA-like well highly activated exhausted CD8 cells signature T-bet+ PB; (2) Tbetbright effector-like CD8 cell responses, less robust CD4 cell responses, Ki67+ PB memory B cells; (3) immunotype largely lacking detectable lymphocyte response infection, suggesting failure immune activation. UMAP embedding resolved cell activation immunotype, suggesting link CD4 cell activation, Immunotype 1, increased severity score. Although differences age race existed cohorts could impact immune variables, major UMAP relationships preserved even correcting variables. Thus, immunotypes may reflect fundamental differences ways patients respond SARS-CoV2 infection.

A second key observation studies robust PB response. patients PB frequencies rivaling found acute Ebola Dengue infection (34, 42, 43, 55). Furthermore, blood PB frequencies typically correlated blood activated cTfh responses (40). However, COVID-19 patients, relationship PB activated cTfh weak. lack relationship two cell types disease could due cell-independent B cell responses, lack activated cTfh peripheral blood time point, lower CXCR5 expression observed across lymphocyte populations, making difficult identify cTfh. Indeed, activated (CD38+HLA-DR+) CD4 cells could play role providing B cell help, perhaps part extrafollicular response, connection also robust current data. ICU patients made SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies, suggesting least part PB response antigen-specific. Indeed, cTfh response correlate antibodies suggesting least humoral response targeted virus. Future studies needed address antigen specificity, ontogeny, role pathogenesis robust PB responses.

A striking feature patients strong B cell activation proliferation durability response. B activation interesting considering clinical lymphopenia many patients. lymphopenia, however, preferential CD8 cells. may notable focal lymphopenia preferentially affecting CD8 cells also feature acute Ebola infection macaques associated CD95 expression severe disease (55). Indeed CD95 associated activated cell clusters COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, frequency KI67+ CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8 CD4 cell responses COVID-19 patients similar magnitude acute viral infections live attenuated vaccines humans (47‚Äì49). However, many acute viral infections, peak CD8 CD4 cell responses window detectable PB peripheral blood relatively short (43, 56, 57). stability CD8 CD4 cell activation PB responses COVID-19 disease suggests prolonged period peak immune responses time hospitalization perhaps failure appropriately down-regulate responses patients. ideas would fit overaggressive immune response and/or ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù (2) subset patients. Indeed, patients, found elevated serum cytokines stimulation cells vitro provoked cytokines chemokines capable activating recruiting myeloid cells. key question identify patients selected immune regulatory treatment avoiding treating patients already weak B cell responses.

An additional major finding ability connect immune features disease severity time sampling also trajectory disease severity change time. Using correlative analyses, observed relationships features different immunotypes, patient comorbidities, clinical features COVID-19 disease. integrating ~200 immune features extensive clinical data, disease severity scores, temporal changes, built integrated computational model connected patient immune response phenotype disease severity. Moreover, UMAP embedding approach allowed us connect integrated immune signatures back specific clinically measurable features disease. integrated immune signatures captured Components 1 2 UMAP model provided support notion Immunotypes 1 2. analyses suggested Immunotype 1, comprised robust CD4 cell activation, paucity cTfh proliferating effector/exhausted CD8 cells T-bet+ PB involvement, connected severe disease whereas Immunotype 2, characterized traditional effector CD8 cells subsets, less CD4 cell activation proliferating PB memory B cells, better captured UMAP Component 2. Immunotype 3, minimal lymphocyte activation response observed, may represent ~20% COVID-19 patients potentially important scenario consider patients may failed mount robust antiviral B cell response. UMAP integrated modeling approach could improved future additional data immune cell types and/or comprehensive data circulating inflammatory mediators patients. Nevertheless, findings provoke idea tailoring clinical treatments future immune-based clinical trials patients whose immunotype suggests greater potential benefit.

Respiratory viral infections cause pathology result immune response weak results virus-induced pathology, immune response strong leads immunopathology (58). data suggest immune response hospitalized COVID-19 patients may fall across spectrum immune response patterns, presenting distinct immunotypes linked clinical features, disease severity, temporal changes response pathogenesis. study provides compendium immune response data also integrated framework ‚Äúmap‚Äù connecting immune features disease. localizing patients immune topology map built dataset, begin infer types therapeutic interventions may useful specific patients. hope armed people freak turn violent really quick. hope turn next Israel open every region up.

Hey, buddy, instead ruining brain wastebin, mod microwave stick head door microwave brain fluids.

It's effect. less time consuming. thought already that? Local Walmart cop two outside making sure everyone wearing mask.  put ton sanitizer hands touch mask, enough coat hands transfer mask touch it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è data virus... simple HAHA LATE US ""recovery"" indicative American workers recovering. I've presented plenty metrics know this, respond pointing GDP lol. waste time engage this, I'd rather reminder show things even worse months. non-American access American military members can't accurately judge everything thank good news. think appreciate disposable Walmart employees company. reigning US champions wage slavery economics. Strange, I'm keeping body freezer, say 'in use'. cloth mask cuts risk contracting covid also reduces risk would spread disease Proud say people wesring masks Wal-Mart problem live. We're bitching wearing mask. data Start today Monday . ton them, actually I'll listen Dr. Doom, rather White House advisor Chuck Woolery. nursing homes staffed Nurse Assistants, maybe one nurse staff per shift one doctor call.

It‚Äôs mandatory yet businesses would rather take fine kick potential customer. think it‚Äôs potential money bringing rather small chance officer would show fine them. corporations may say it‚Äôs employees won‚Äôt put harms way, end know it‚Äôs pocket book. They‚Äôll take fine chump change businesses versus loosing thousands dollars per day non mask wearers. government said depending size business net worth allow customers inside without face covering fine million dollars mandatory every person facility would entitled health pay put risk corporations expense guarantee companies would actually enforce masks. common issue.

It cropping Alabama well, least point.

The Alabama Department Public Health website noted third-party labs reporting negative tests conducted.

In Alabama, least, legislation mostly refers referring/reporting positive test results reportable diseases department public health, labs really considered case would requested send stats negative cases well.

In pre COVID-19 world, kind makes sense. health department care negative HIV test, etc., would background noise. decades worth research masks recently overturned? maybe let whiners get system Walmart deal much 'murica freedum' Citations needed. Don‚Äôt spread bullshit without facts please, whichever side opinion falls on. I‚Äôm Central FL. would say strong mask compliance live gets better every day. part living life normal one nearly everything open people work. get eyerolls  big issue. ‚ÄúIn recent days, Florida Department Health noticed smaller, private labs weren‚Äôt reporting negative test result data state,‚Äù DOH told WPLG statement

So tiny amount data skewed short period time. saying ok, positivity rate number daily new cases high across whole state number weeks now. Misreporting cases cause high numbers. home dept maintain limited capacity policy due whackos, Walmart definitely able maintain one. war us this. understand?!?! Nothing improving. many requirements hoops jump get tested first place makes sense places high rates positive tests. people getting tested infected. Unless another government bandaid airlines losing employees affects exponential number people work transportation travel industries. Sounds like Ghyna.  No, won't, real data still going collected, it'll happen outside government's control.

Information wants free. Good!  Lol, pro-level trolling right here. think accomplished goal lol. Can't hurt make people laugh times like this. good soul. EVER HAPPENED YOU, would want feel guilt forever cook alive like fever killed father?

I'm going boldly predict early next week right wing media full reports turning radon mitigation systems need protect family COVID, EPA regulations actually responsible millions deaths.

You heard first. frustrated.

I've frustrated. I'm preparing punch people mouth. Shut up. Every Little mistake make pointless. 

The day store, seen lots people wearing mask even gloves, let's look it. people seen saw people touching mask, kids parents wearing mask vise versa. One guy maksed gloved received phone call pulls mask super safe gloves, put phone face, rubs mouth gloved hands. 

How wearing mask bad follow rules couch sneeze shirt arm. touch face wash hands frequently?

You act like mask shield look closely wasting money trying protect people can't follow three simple rules; touch face, couch shirt elbow wash hands frequently. mandatory TX anyways. problem Walmart employees wear mask nose let hang around neck.

We refrigerator trucks full dead people need get entire world vaccinated. logic, ignore territories vastly different one another well populated -- thus enhancing weakening transmission. sum up, would incredibly difficult expensive task.

The idea vaccinate enough people virus able replicate infect others. That's immunity herd idea comes in, vaccination. getting millions people killed. Depends Wal-Mart.

My local store chucked random employees front black shirts. doubt old man leaning trash stay upright dealing anyone. ""but die?  think care even data came out.

 Oxford scientists believe made breakthrough quest Covid-19 vaccine discovering jab triggers response may offer ""double defence"" virus.

Phase human trials world-leading Oxford vaccine shown generates immune response disease, Telegraph learned.

Blood samples taken group UK volunteers given dose vaccine showed stimulated body produce antibodies ‚Äòkiller T-cells‚Äô, senior source said.

The discovery promising separate studies suggested antibodies may fade away within months T-cells stay circulation years.

However source cautioned results, ‚Äúextremely promising‚Äù, yet prove Oxford vaccine provides long-lasting immunity Covid-19.

‚ÄúI tell know Oxford vaccine covers bases - produces cell antibody response,‚Äù senior source told Telegraph.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs combination two hopefully keep people safe.

‚ÄúSo far, good. It‚Äôs important moment. still long way go.‚Äù


Another source close team described presence antibodies T-cells ‚Äúdouble defence‚Äù Covid-19.

The full findings published Lancet medical journal July 20, confirmed Wednesday night.

The findings based initial results Phase 1 clinical trial, began Oxford April doses vaccine given 500 volunteers. major trial currently underway involving 5,000 volunteers virus-hit Brazil prove vaccine effective, drugmaker AstraZeneca signed deal produce two billion doses. goes well, researchers hope vaccine may ready early October.

The initial data also suggests ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine safe major side effects, understood, although work needed. team also evaluating level dose needed produce effective response.

Stocks soared Wednesday reports positive news Oxford vaccine released next week. Shares AstraZeneca, drugmaker licensed produce billions doses Oxford vaccine, jumped 5.2 per cemt.

David Carpenter, chair Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (REC), approved Oxford trial continues work scientists amendments, told Telegraph team ‚Äúabsolutely track‚Äù.

‚ÄúThey strengthen findings targeting people hospitals, healthcare professionals, spread (more) likely happen.

**‚ÄúNobody put final dates.. things might go wrong reality working big pharma company, vaccine could fairly widely available around September sort target working on.‚Äù**


The T-cell discovery likely important scientists increasingly believe successful vaccine need trigger production antibodies cells, directly attack human cells already become infected viruses.

Earlier year similar vaccine MERS invented Oxford team found elicit high levels T-cells, triggered neutralising antibodies 44 per cent volunteers.

If Covid vaccine proven trials elicit similarly strong T-cell response, team hopes may need trigger high levels antibodies provide meaningful protection.

A number vaccine candidates across world also produced T-Cell responses, smaller scale studies. Others including major project China thought unlikely produce T-cells tested humans.

This week US biotech company, Moderna, published data phase one trial involving 45 people showing RNA vaccine triggered neutralising antibodies cells.

The findings come amid increasing gloom longevity Covid-19 antibodies. Earlier week, Kings College study found people recovered Covid-19 appeared lose antibodies within months.

But study published Nature today researchers found Cells SARS outbreak lasted 17 years.

Duke University Scientists Singapore found Cells still circulating potent quantities patients infected 2003. known sure true Covid-19, whether Cells protect re-infection, but, speaking Telegraph, lead researcher described discovery ""potentially significant vaccine"".

The researchers also found ""remarkable"" levels cells able latch Covid-19 virus within people never infected disease.

They believe may triggered common cold animal coronaviruses - mainly originating bats - primed cells may also offer protection new virus.

Professor Bartoletti, led research Singapore, said may explain patients Singapore South East Asia really severe infections.

He said Cells common Asia, present around world. suggests significant proportion populations degree natural immunity Covid-19.

Clinical trials Oxford vaccine, marking phase III UK involving 8,000 participants, almost complete. focus moved Brazil South Africa, disease prevalent, scientists hope gather sufficient cases within around month. CDC estimates 61000 people die flu per year United States, despite yearly vaccinations. 4 months, 140000 people died. That's twice yearly flu deaths third time.

Even think deaths lie, people receiving severe lung damage blood clots lead future problems like strokes heart attacks. Get picture [lungs ""This happens people get hit COVID-19 survive. Organ damage months, years weakness, lifetime consequences.

Even 1% people get much damage (the truth do), that's 3 million workers cannot work did, causing drain support systems last long time.

That's case - mostly effective vaccine combined treatments like antibodies turn COVID much manageable disease They're already stating preamble's Facebook right now. go customer service desk Monday get money order, lady behind counter told gotten less 10 calls people cursing screaming her. give number corporate office hangs them. seemed pretty defeated all. first day rule effect. probably lol Unfortunately ""flatten curve"" turned ""if cases hold steady 3 weeks let's open everything back up.""

Governors even grasp whole flatten curve thing meant first place. Whew boy, Monday Walmart gonna chaotic Black Friday...yikes  Arrogance stupidity basically us facing challenge climate change. yeah, we're fucked. Last time went Walmart (like 6 weeks ago) limiting many customers could come in, using social distance markers plexiglass barriers registers sounds good. 

BUT one respected distance markers, almost none employees wore masks customers employees going around barriers talk easily. Kind shit show. Hopefully it‚Äôs getting better. Aah shit What's whole ""I refuse live fear"" thing many people doing? fear become bad thing? Go ahead criticize want, don‚Äôt care. don‚Äôt disingenuous it. There‚Äôs many things wrong posters statement. Governor 'Rona DeSanitize store, rules. maintain (private) stores able refuse service anyone reason. Wait... you‚Äôre telling ‚Äúplan‚Äù?? this, actually, critical form intelligence need. ARE, fact, intelligent. Wow would though one finds butt ugly? look like decoration you‚Äôd find grandma‚Äôs house. like cybertruck, though. bought different day? got mine Saturday. really real them. people job basically ""it's hoax"" kinda people one guy got sick test since exposed HR want announce tested ""since might freak people out"". hoax, bro, freaked out. ya know? choke zones

Sploosh. Hire work bouncers, can‚Äôt think anyone qualified turn control people away business 
"" make desolation call peace "" shut people complaining hospitals full, though?

Or perhaps going bankrupt.  that's fuckin idiot.  one same. literally effort wear mask minute store. benefits far outweigh costs mask wearing would much rather shop place requirement people wear masks. time know way Walmart nooks crannies surveil everyone time make sure odd Shopper sneaking mask off. suspect plan enforce hope store policy influence enough.

In perfect world anyone refuses wear mask give future medical care contract virus. perfect least would something. I‚Äôm sure miss lot  *hoods

FTFY lmao Captain Trumps People tell they've seen that, people arent Reddit, comparing media coverage Asia Europe, blatantly obvious American media avoids using upsetting footage lot elsewhere.

Ultimateely American media's complicit causing country standout clusterfuck compared others. Case point, talking second wave, insinuating first wave over, 1500 still dying day, whole 2nd wave phase lead directly careless attitude lead us records today let kids get haircut. I'm standing shop, one else me, wife, two kids two stylists.... still bring get haircut. Probably there's real threat workers finally snapping getting a...... (whispers) union honest, fair point hurt failed response federal government. highlights much less even incensed travesty Trump's pandemic response.

However, fact people hurt mean pretend virus exist...because still hurt them. economy controlled virus ""let's destroy economy long-term pretending virus gone"" better ""let's aggressive short-term lockdown done"". Long ago four nations lived Harmony. everything changed Karen Nation Attacked known Walmart arrived April, congrats St. Louis County mask mandate still saw 4 people stores without them. need start kicking people everyone scared upset Karens. limit people store misleading. limit allows many people. 6 months late ya?   Oh boy. live sw Florida 25% people see wearing masks. I‚Äôm gonna interesting experience Walmart milk runs Haha good one! Kill people! spur moment thing week ago said surveillance room kinda stuck since coworkers thought hilarious lol I'm fan Rhymezone.

Everything could want know use word, RZ got you.

Fucking link function reddit always fucks me.  WASN‚ÄôT ALREADY THING?? Rednecks got excuses. Fuck'em I'm glad over, guys! get back normal ""We'd love more, just... Y'know..."" respected medical authorities lie public benefits masks hoarding them? Respected medical authorities actively chose mislead public instead instructing make masks healthcare professionals direly needed existing stock? Fauci lies. I‚Äôm thinking 82 year old greeters get asses whooped Karen Brad whose constitutional rights infringed upon Walmart making become sheep wearing mask...  said fun thing people every year so, stop trying holy üòÑ

Swedes go denmark drink, everybody knows it.

(...and keep asking sources I'll start throwing Danish jokes drunk Swedes people around stop.) Yes, dumbfucks, public health laws mandates protect right stay alive.

(I know /s, I'm responding selfish morons.) confirm, least worked decade ago. multiple tests/training modules took bad unions would us associates anyone brought unions report them. going friends house vector.

It's linear conversation guy ""our fault""

Speak kemosabe.

Some us isolating since March yelling everyone could would inevitably happen. Kinda like China. would want physically handle dozens anti-mask idiots probably going intentionally breathing coughing direction? I‚Äôm popcorn I'm concerned poor workers enforce this. prefer dying living another day world case makes sense slow test. Ohio. right mix extremists population density. False happened Chicago well

There giant surge 

It doesn‚Äôt seem spread bad outside directly linked states reopened 

NYC life form, can‚Äôt compare another city states stop haven‚Äôt reopened 

I‚Äôm saying wrong doubt nyc achieved herd immunity may even possible 

You guys don‚Äôt know anything shut fuck lol

It‚Äôs fucking insane shit coming mouth right actually think it‚Äôs correct based information know completely fucking contradicts hell wrong you? here. I've known cry way home. already hell. fucking lol, easy. Get rid DeSantis it‚Äôll get less darker. Considering high paying, high stress job, would think so. sitting around day. Sad! Good question, complicated nuanced answer.

The US Gov't passed PPP, Payroll Protection Program, part CARES Act March. effectively ""bail out"" businesses would struggle pandemic providing business large loan funds auspices funds would used business continue pay employees retain employees point business would turning. would allow business retain funds already have, would still making time pay business costs product operating costs like rent/utilities. loan forgiven business meets large amount qualifiers, related using money pay employees (not anything else).

Basically, bail help business unless one thing; stay open provide work employees.

Bars Gyms, two largest groups businesses US complaining right now, businesses who's entire business model works anathema containing virus. Bars attract large groups people, enclosed environments, provide social gathering spot social distancing cannot occur, also drinking mask friendly. Combine point bars people get tipsy/inebriated, peoples ability make good choices goes window. essence, can't rationally bar open providing reasonable accommodations ensure safety patrons staff.

Same obviously true gyms. Shared equipment high touch values, aerosol spread respiratory droplets, sweat, spit, name it. There's marginally better argument favor gyms, could distance machines provide staff disinfect machine use, again, they're indoors usually moderately small location, argument still spread due HVAC system much like restaurants.

Because much higher risk two locations specifically, almost states closed them, kept closed, phased reopen, classified businesses last reopen category. There's also argument easily made businesses superfluous best, alcohol bought elsewhere consumed home, exercise literally done anywhere, including home.

As such, since businesses cannot stay open, grabbing PPP Loan useless them, businesses shuttered, releasing employees little recourse stay viable unless open up, declare bankruptcy. still pay rent location, there's rent freeze, still general operating costs like utilities pay, zero income.

They corona victim, simply due nature pandemic, way CARES Act/PPP Loan plan designed. government created plan fly back napkin think ramifications. business owners also looking bigger picture; open want risk potential litigation become Corona hotspot? want risk lives employees lives? looking bigger picture lobbying either financial relief safely reopen, sort bankruptcy protection shut down, instead owners creating stunts like get attention. haven‚Äôt even heard single test actually cost money US. priced reach? girl took test didn‚Äôt even flash insurance card.  What's wrong it?  
Better late never guess...but Jesus, really need dilly dally around 2 months this. writing wall, end mask policy eventually, might well pass ordinance (2 months ago) get with. Problem covid hoaxers already using cannon fodder continue narrative covid overblown everything fine really reason wear masks. 

I feel like Florida making tiny bit progress pushing narrative wear makes better job social distancing...now back square 1 putting people's lives jeapordy again. Florida won‚Äôt close tourism money.

When tourism done, might right thing/ don‚Äôt think Target requires masks yet. let people use bathrooms aligned gender identity, guess they‚Äôve already written off. people running options! probably mild cold flu season unless flu strain particularly virulent 

Don't tempting 2020 like that... üé∂ Oh, ain‚Äôt America üé∂ r/leopardsatemyface Yes. mask event parents exposed result. please rush impeachment? fucker things hiding reality allow open schools, open country tourism. Nobody going come, specially Europe, aren‚Äôt fucking stupid shaved hair last night. I'm 41 year old woman mid back length mixed hair (think diana/tracy ellis ross type hair).

It much work - either three hours salon $$$ endless hours home trying get presentable. mostly wore bun past months. took daaaays dry control.

Took dogs clippers head last night found local barber takes one person shop time mandatory mask policy. Got low fade edge longest part 3 guard.

I'll probably never grow hair again. People getting tired it. Social distancing followed anymore. city 100,000 people big, we've got 8 active cases 2 couple weeks ago seems going up. mask public least. elderly high risk person know texted tucker carlson stuff.  Pissed get that. slippery slope believe represents would happen real life all. Bill Nye noted:

Oh, let go get popcorn chair sit Walmart parking lot, good. bubble already compromised ... havn't requiring masks whole time? They‚Äôre exactly Walmart first regard. anything they're probably last.  acted majority shoppers ready comply, would disrupted operations stores people freaked large numbers. carefully monitoring situation, probably pilot stores implementing new policies, judged sentiment masks faded point safe require them. New Jersey we've months everywhere. But, unfortunately, science worked us we're suffering 10,000 cases per--oh, we're not? We've gone one worst one best? Woah. guess wearing mask help. Especially governor orders statewide &amp; people listen want suffer consequences... then... shockingly... would thought... lowers transmission rates, lowering cases, lowering fatalities, allows reasonable reopenings.

Yes insane Walmart already requiring masks. Everything Walmart sucks guys - everyday workers. 24h-48h turnaround possible sort standard Germany. technically fairly run mill test. huge delays symptom messed Covid response underfunding general health infrastructure (not enough distributed labs) due heath services priced reach many. news, water wet. Canada, heard first hand accounts worker calling - getting tested - results come back negative still quarantine 2 weeks (per employers request). one time one company either, I've heard similar stories different industries. Well, gave waivers businesses, whats unreasonable schools? government wants open disallow waivers, budget money pay legal fees. fact normal person option shop Walmart....My Walmart surprisingly sane. actually rare occurrence something happens there.

I'm rural area Walmart basically store shop household goods unless want drive hour, vast majority relatives/co-workers freedumb variety comes pandemic social distancing/wearing masks.

I know lot terrified trying best stop spread there's still disturbingly large amount people get think masks worst inconvenience man kind. *I understand.* Genuine question someone knows nothing process: effective and/or safe rushed vaccine?


Note - 100% entirely pro-vaccine meant shit stirring question. I'm thinking along lines hydroxychloroquine supposedly great option months later turns actually harm good.


Don't drugs, including vaccines, usually need extended period testing know they're safe effective? vaccine different sense really can't much harm, might super effective? Chance EXPOSURE (meaning someone else positive), contracting virus.

I think math flawed though. Bees? feel like simply communicated basic information provides masks actually help. believe reason people take masks seriously think makes difference.

The key missing information concept ‚Äúinfecting dose"" many copies virus takes actually get infected, know exact amount yet. know masks distancing reduce total number virus microbes exchanged, thus decreasing rate spread number people infected.

 Another important variable ‚Äúviral load"", many copies virus system, means exactly many viruses shed environment, currently seem clear answer this, viral load appears vary independently far severity symptoms go. Since two factors unknown, rational course action take precaution necessary otherwise determined. better safe sorry here, health, others line.

What done perhaps businesses offer complimentary masks require masks shop, avoid high tension situations, offer cheap masks cost. responsibility businesses supply people masks, might go long way prevent conflict. definitely agree there. Walmart 5 years. hated goddamn store long coronavirus. look Walmart subreddits. got honest American public took even minimally effective action, would absolutely worries re-elected.

The honest route probably never occurred him. Wait now? worker customers wear masks like 2 months Germany They're trying keep testing bubble.  Hell, Walmart house duty officers show closing time stopped remaining open 24x7. condolences virus. Fully agree think worse place try enforce local WM Michigan employee stand outside right entrance. assume enforcing state‚Äôs tougher mandate went effect Monday. 99% masks on.

I‚Äôm really deep need spread misinformation this. posted data it‚Äôs really something debated... probably already said, going enforce employees wearing masks correctly one way isles? they've seem proactively enforce Walmart I've in.

[Nearly one-third children tested COVID Florida positive. Palm Beach County‚Äôs health director warns risk long-term  You‚Äôre fine you‚Äôre fine calm down. ones gonna that... It‚Äôs amazing many governors fail connect dots... I‚Äôve two different Wal-marts last month already requiring masks. worried administration try suppress real data, admin commanded hospitals stop sending data CDC instead send Trump administration directly. Please, please, please sign petition data continues reported CDC: http://chng.it/jNHqgT5L9T. live AZ, know two people able get tested. One waited 8 days, waited 11 days results. also know people denied tests didn‚Äôt meet enough requirements. fun begins. Ohhhhh poor 'muricans scream rights Stitt attended many public events often photographed public wearing mask, including indoor rally President Trump held Tulsa June 20. surge coronavirus cases around Tulsa likely tied rally, city‚Äôs top health official said last week. foresee ton new anti mask morons featured r/publicfreakout really fucked shit mentioned currently happening US, Brazil, Russia, lot much poorer countries. recommend hospitals maintain original data structure, also CDC plays stupid, hospitals tell White House new COVID cases. Problem solved. No. I‚Äôd recommend reading [this Seoul call center paper also good suggestion. 

My understanding: 

1. People (or most) infectious prior youth showing symptoms. 

2. cloth mask isn‚Äôt likely protect people. 

3. aerosolized virus going accumulate mix air hours, 6 feet away. Tests 49 139 people robust sample size, zero positives good news. 

More generally, quick haircut people wearing masks fairly low-risk activity, especially go early morning things get busy. assess risk ourselves, decided okay. harder deciding get dental cleaning, felt much nervous getting haircut. Covid could go years, yes? Assuming immunity last forever vaccine work out. Unfortunately maybe 1.65 mil question. still understand Herd immunity 

50% get u contain equal opportunity spreader gross misinterpretation data got wildly popular. 

Of people actually confirmed infections, nearly cells antibodies. data showing people cells antibodies general population likely reflected people never exposed virus cross reactive cells. Yeah. mean policies basically exact throughout whole UK excluding mandatory masks shops goes effect England 24th, confuses me.
And speaking someone living Scotland almost one wearing masks became mandatory. Ummm, actually, everything America's fault. Even something really problem. Like this. It'll disappear like miracle right.... North Carolina. NOPE. I've working wearing mask required. care family want sick worse. Nobody gave hazard pay made fun of.

Edit: also told employer feel safe. response ""I CARE!"" life meaningless government employer world. hate living here. feel embarrassed live country laws created enforced order people protect epidemic.

Whoever got idea turn covid-19 political thing needs get shot. odd way announce everyone uneducated are. Leave big business government done along Thry shut 1. Fuck using Karen. bullshit. Pro tip: armed group eager step state retreated failed think they‚Äôre getting arrangement


Another pro tip: It‚Äôs likely altruistically motivated cloth mask, wash uses. Otherwise, yeah, reuse it. get it. hate equality. Seems Europe starting pay attention now. Helps well think Scotland introduced policy heavily accepted seems noted English speaking world.

My work gave great ones. Really warm all. That's gonna go spectacularly MAGA / People Walmart crowd.

Get ready then. :) occasionally miss catch mouths, kick foot like soccer ball.. needless say good soccer :) wrong thing I'd like see stores hire mask bouncers, responsible enforcement, employees trying normal jobs (or least would backup tell someone ""I'm ringing / asking leave""). 
 
At least one comment tweet ""Walmart lost business."" Hopefully widespread prolific. us American's deserve this?

Political apathy. last couple decades, lost sense value working government slowly accepted (little little) government corrupt nothing could done it. pieces place (in Senate DoJ), someone like Donny could stroll turn corruption overdrive.

What now? Become politically active (more posting disdain Reddit, FB, Twitter). Get everyone know vote November tell get friends also vote November. Watch out, Virginia! So, according WH, main causes enablers COVID-19 firestorm raging US Fauci, CDC, WHO, China. problem waiting March. 

The reality deaths cases revolving around North East New York New Jersey leading way almost 1,200 deaths. combined peak.

Most Midwest states (besides Michigan) southern/west coast states left relatively unscathed. 

This created false sense alarm, especially hospital beds fill up. 

So many people came lockdown thinking virus overblown could go back living life used be...then days got warmer people took advantage nice weather gather socialize July 4th happened people really pleased went party. 

Now true surge beginning, waiting March April finally coming fruition alot states take seriously first go around. Governor Blackface piece shit. halfway decent thing done totally fuck coronavirus situation. got tested Denver area last Wednesday, doctor's office. (negative) results 48 hours.

However, also heard reports area going ""big free testing"" locations waiting 7-10 days results. 

I see local big testing area near 7-day wait get tested, could driven next closest location got tested next day. doctor's office closer next big ""testing location"", went instead. 

Not certain difference, perhaps big testing locations going single lab backed doctor's office sent different lab inundated?

edit - grammar means constantly seeing Wal-Mart employees using mask chin strap, I'm down. ""So quit?""

Quitting disqualifies unemployment. He/She'd luck, broke, looking probably similar job. like good time change careers jobs, ya know...  like 2 months behind Costco retailers. Better late never guess Disingenuous candid sincere, typically pretending one knows less something one really does

No, that‚Äôs correct word. doesn‚Äôt anything misleading people, anything direct question was. uk sweden deaths per capita us.

I'm going back took 1 day exposure happened. Trust instincts. one else looking you. common thing read ""just tell wear one medical reasons"" followed something else idiotic like ""Merica"" ""Freedom"". suggested one caught other, could independent cases? makings feel-good story, possibility coworker transmission drains me, personally. go anywhere work, groceries per month. wear mask coworkers wear 80% walking around, never workstations. Coworker spread biggest fear rn. grocery store. also went cabin Appalachia. stop anywhere drive there, leave cabin there, stop way back. socialize even once. social events. stay alive starve though. government needs adult make children leave room get work done controlling virus. thousands club bar bouncers unemployment right now.

For fucks sake Enjoy buddy.   anger liberals conservatives different. Conservatives want good schools except ones pay kids attend. Liberals want ""opportunity schools"" skim ""best best"" make look like they're inclusive/doing something. think tend believe long there's privileged class get good outcomes, education ""solved""--they differ class want get good outcome.

Please note using liberal traditional sense American sense ""anyone left Saint Reagan"". can't tell sarcastic really mean it, case:

Deaths trending down. Death RATES trending down.

You get death rate taking number people die dividing number people sick (within certain time period, place, etc., depending specific death rate trying determine.)

The thing COVID, often takes two weeks realize sick, perhaps two four weeks longer actually die. Particularly hospitals completely overwhelmed yet keep going ventilator while.

So, WHENEVER large number people get sick time, death rates go while. That's math: number bottom fraction getting bigger, number top fraction isn't. Yet.

THIS TEMPORARY CONDITION happens lot people gotten sick died yet. month passed, sick people start getting around dying (and hospitals start getting overwhelmed), rate goes right back was, even higher.

Put fact together fact takes us get data testing (Arizona reporting 26-day backlog) find situation. numbers numbers several weeks ago, people still getting sick dying huge numbers yet. Clearly, situation ground deteriorated since then. appreciates position public responsibility, perhaps wants make flubbing March. What's population Arizona?.10 million? walmarts greeters (mainly count people store get full) since quarantine Ultimately save money long run. Economies going back restriction even lockdowns due coronavirus spread good Walmart. Speaking critical care nurse Alabama, it‚Äôs blowing incredibly fast. beds full town, people can‚Äôt get care causing spike deaths. really sucks lots recoveries use convalescent plasma steroids, damn remdesivir drug never remember spell. People read anything since isn‚Äôt much else entertainment, lot people
Are pushing stuff people read whether substance. Hell, took 4 months. read article. see evidence parks causing spread. Saying ‚Äúsome people fear‚Äù using word ‚Äúmay‚Äù sure let people get away spreading misinformation days making $16/hour thinking lucky üòï   shocking people wear masks grocery stores.. staff included. bad time working Walmart great time Internet exist.  mostly stayed home work outbreak, go Home Depot last week.

I decided count. 78 customers, 28 masks. didn‚Äôt matter young old, male female, black white, 1 3 regardless.

It‚Äôs frustrating bit depressing. I‚Äôm trying part, it‚Äôs much me, fucking everyone. add I‚Äôm area country cases deaths surging, it‚Äôs like use excuse ‚Äúwe‚Äôve already peaked.‚Äù federal government massive failure unfortunately. ""developed"" countries governments catch hell lot flak find good things they've done sort offset discussion had.

America lately...

I feel like y'all trapped groundhog day / Dr Evil Austin Powers spin flogged worth. would imagine they're waiting whole lot longer determine effective is. Remember taken something like 6 months 10% US infected \*bugs bunny sawing florida.gif\* Ya varies Walmart I'm GTA visit different Walmart's get various items outa stock of.. run different mersures enforced, hell store left half staff wearing chinstrapping masks. 0 enforcement, another store like super strict rather go reg basis. people care, would mask on. deserve get think right spread virus kill people. sounds like they‚Äôre hiring bouncers - ‚ÄúHealth Ambassadors dressed black standing entrance‚Äù got knocked hard Flu back. bed week. thought heart going explode couple times beating fast.

Took probably 2-3 months got back feeling normal. high heartrate probably 2-3 weeks fever broke.

I heard COVID worse. thanks. Death rates trending largely due improved treatments average age infected younger. 

I strongly suspect hospitals get overwhelmed benefits improved treatments become severely reduced. 4 row count... noticed 4 days ago expecting late day update.. watched every day since then. view opinion high regard view alpha/leader 

i nothing decisions. i'm guy. never better time make argument love. 

Try (with copious dose empathy suffering). might get time. Tell local militias unmasked Antifa infiltrating stores. couple good ol' boys AR-15s door screaming unmasked would wonders compliance. It‚Äôs attacking people due testing. stop testing overflowing ICUs empty, obviously. That‚Äôs phase 3 trial rolling right Gives customers time source masks employees time gird loins. Many local areas Alabama strict though. Many order Oxford vaccine data published Monday.

Next week either going awesome depressing.  It‚Äôs always weird see people making comments thinking they‚Äôre making woke social commentary reality actually coming racist hell. late delete this. always illegal put public danger idiot. Interesting idea, never happen. Wal Mart one largest drain police resources almost every city operate. states told Wal Mart hire security expect bill state much time waste day calls simple someone forgetting scan pack gum self check out. departments liaison officer whose sole job sit Wal Mart security office deal shoplifters simply due often Wal Mart calls police. One year single Wal Mart called police 2,000 times vs local Target's 300 calls amount time. Good luck that. get wrong, completely agree mandate it, type person typically shops Walmart also person thinks masks unconstitutional. Venn diagram circle.  wonder go. live Washington State gov mandated wearing masks. day heading walmart saw guy ahead get refused mask. coincidentally time someone walking without mask. hear question, assume guy trying enter asked no-mask guy deal hear mask guy say ""I told religion, mandate, law"". go Walmart buy face mask any? thought states already mandated mask wearing? Richard quarantine applies person arriving state positive test rate higher 10 per 100,000 residents 7-day rolling average state 10% higher positivity rate 7-day rolling average. OMG giggle-snorted one kind respiratory issues specifically? (a mask actually helps respiratory issues) really sucks see grandmother. That's glib, really does. Respects able given member family death, given chance awful end life survivor.

I would wonder would supported fact protests happening, given race. Obviously context pandemic, that's entirely different question, whether she'd thought protests were, vacuum, worthy done. dont provide shirt pants Already? Quit trollin Yeah no, also fault knowingly traveling location predicament. need government accountability going hand hand personal responsibility pull quickly successfully would thought people understood testing phases trial for. better idea getting Americans behave like adults, I'm ears. virus still active May June. largest study conducted Germany school children teachers included testing schools coronavirus outbreaks. study included schools outbreaks occurred community. 

I love many people say, ‚ÄúI follow science‚Äù presented well conducted study response is, ‚ÄúBut...‚Äù Though delayed day two, usually due ot veryifying things think. ""smarter"" ? ""Diffult"" ?  LOL love this. I'm sad employees. security place thus? even week Michigan grocery store employee stabbed masks. appreciate it. still need find tactful way expressing it. You‚Äôd think wouldn‚Äôt take long name like Operation Warpspeed, legit used term Operation Warpspeed discussing world wide pandemic...anything happen!

Beam up, Scotty! I've wondering adjuvant working. understand adjuvant irritates body stimulate immune response result achieved less vaccine. contact tracing team one robust world right Watch grilled cheese Karen I'm embracing too, highly doubt I'll get haircut year things going, already 2months overdue. am, it‚Äôs still ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù. anyway - I‚Äôve got way many old folks life care about, (not mention broader civic duty) - wondered means finally shop Walmart again; I‚Äôve avoiding like plague (haha) account hygiene average Walmart shopper, risk carrying someone‚Äôs COVID-cough home clothes.  worldwide outdoor protests happened, many people said ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù others go out, I. took socially distanced road trip/vacation immediate family awesome. whole beach ourselves. can't say want say get banned here. It'll worse that.

I'm worried we'll start seeing conspiratorial types shouting hospitals deliberately murdering anyone seeks treatment get ""COVID bonuses""--which will, spread, drive even people seek treatment (which *add* death toll). Infection number explode schools open.

I've seen people say school school aged children shut up. ridiculous. puts children risk everyone comes contact risk.

Everyone this. School aged children everyone risk. right speak. confirm mine disabled vet. Even that's true, ""Northerners"" done spread easily re-opened.

In words, he's saying basically, ""re-opening Northerners could come visit hang bars cause surge, Northerners coming visiting hanging bars did!"" reusable mask

You get better mask. grew regulations. pushback several first introduced. largely faded became ""norm"" penalties imposed (no shopping, seatbelt tickets, etc) We‚Äôre like 112 right trailing GDP. Don‚Äôt know answer that. Historically suggested want 80%. 80% Obama. It‚Äôs good. don‚Äôt want raise taxes business reduce business spending. need save ways. Maybe taxing 1% excessively.... sure. Don‚Äôt forget States Local governments also facing massive shortfalls. comes temper tantrums."
