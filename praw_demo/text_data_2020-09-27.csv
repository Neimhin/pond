0,2020-09-27,"  Natural selection finest bad get chance spread lockdown shit fast (SARS IFR 10% yet 800 people died).

Covid worst be, people show mild symptoms incubation period month yet fatality rate around 1% makes seem dangerous. Republicans: Open florida

Me: wearing mask distance, looking anti maskers getting sick.

Me: haha yes die trash. Agreed! It’s scary think last time cases high shut though. feel like may another one coming judging graphs. doesn’t take long virus grows exponentially explode. 

People area can’t get tests demand high. I’m sure many saying screw going lives instead waiting days get tested. 

Did see car rally Wasaga Beach weekend? People carrying like isn’t pandemic going on. time hospitals 60-70% per major healthcare systems

That's interesting metric seen cited before. source data? sub ccp controlled? Yes appears quite rare, Qatar study showed incidence reinfection 0.02% , measured number probable possible reinfections/total number unique cases Qatar. may overstimate unlike case West, genetically confirmed, may still shredding first infection. hand, may undercounted asymptomatic reinfections seek testing.

I say under.  I'm sure idiotic per say. naive know enough adequate data really get least reasonable predictions place early on. They're trying least. many variables equation. glad people really trying calculate quantify quickly becoming mounds data finally. “I can’t fun, I’m suffering!” doesn’t sound entitled all. Nothing vaccine, people yell clerks know well actually get it. think there's lot overlap group refuse wear masks see potential vaccine dangerous kind hoax. need autocracy, silly!  Florida ... enough said. realize college students live bubble right? indications reinfection right now? Definitely stock wipes diapers impossible get several months. available, expensive. 200,000 gone, come cause know we're counting backwards zero. Fuuuuuuuck whhhhhy?! absolutely 2 options. really bums :( stupid comparison. gonna downvote you. understand many people prefer solitude lack personal contact. realize majority people enjoy social interaction. 

It’s shown studies (refer Dr. Laurie Santos’s podcast) even people think wouldn’t enjoy speaking stranger become happier actually interact one. Humans social animals. Sure. don’t think society would make decision. yeah stupid mean hope vaccine likely end year feel like going go crazy.  America fucked. Jesus, thread? idea many immunologists Reddit, coincidentally ranting “mUh FreEdOmZ”. predicted. shouldn’t depressing, angry.  top 10? position exactly. 

And damage poor third world already irreparable. literally traded lives old, sick, white people future young, brown children. 

(Aside: personally attest COVID-19 lockdowns set back drug development programs cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, many areas six months least. Millions needlessly die future due delays introducing new therapeutics.) really care death toll. #r/iamatotalpieceofshit work nation wide 911 dispatches. Suicides skyrocketed. depressing. costless COVID response. Lovely. top working ass dealing customers can't bare wearing mask 10 minutes ill customers come maskless coronafest night bar. Fuck shit. cannot get parents sick this. really can't risk it.. China eliminated virus, go back normal. NZ. eliminated community transmission restrictions dropped. I'm big conference right now, heading dinner crowded restaurants, masks anywhere. unusual thing scanning QR code Covid-tracer app phone enter place. 

Once US vaccine pursuing elimination strategy like NZ, China, Taiwan others. That's path normal. people don’t even wear masks It’s mostly old people, tears anyone 80 dying reason. 

Death part life.  Well, yeah. ones taking seriously ones going meet public. Prisons like 95% covid positive, so... get caught. handle well, get sore arm days goes away. I'm religious washing hands trying make sure take care cold season well, far (knock wood) I've never gotten wicked sick.

Little background: Multiple Sclerosis, that's auto-immune part. meds take basically weaked immune system (because MS makes body basically attack itself, overactive immune system meds subdue that). disingenuous pretend restrictions place distance stores masks. life interrupted mean restrictions disrupting life others. mean? Ladies Night $2 IV drip specials. Frees cash increasing cash flow Same. pediatrician makes every effort virtual appointments. 

Also, probably large contingent parents need reminded daycares/schools immunization info, leading increased immunization rates. Work home, school home, cancel daycare services, suddenly getting kids' shots date slide priorities list. We’ve already given up. honest see majority people wearing masks streets fine, social distancing friends/families big problem. United States would happened even faster law passed would get shot faster black guy holding nerf gun. One word: [the] constitution. Common law principles friend. can't live them, can't live without them.  You’d drink lives South FL Gotcha, I've sticking self-checkouts going early morning. 
I realize everyone that. 

The fact airborne enough make keep well away people. Even there's distance, try limit long I'm shopping. Especially starts get busy.  Ok - I’m confused. comment Melbourne 5m 4 thousand square miles Dade 2.7m 2.4 thousand square miles - that’s density. 

But density almost nothing Covid - it’s minor factor compared others - Japan, Taiwan, etc low infection rates.

America’s response one world world lot people died. It’s really complex that. 

It’s Miami Dade 2k plus cases per day Melbourne five yesterday double populations (and per figures density). right. Must let survival fittest take course. Let be. rihanna something fairness I've heard argument strain coronavirus mutate often others vaccine may fact possible one.

Working assumption still foolish place hope given timeframe could still years off. 

One year Lockdowns could well end western society least set us back post war era economic hardship. can't allowed happen. getting haircut today woman cuts hair telling brother lost ton weight, good way, convinced either get covid. getting tested least month even though never symptoms. many thousands people describe right now? one countless mental health impacts resulting this.

Hearing story really reading post angry bigger concern I'm kind heated right haha articles seem based patients hospitalized, really skirt conversation around prevalent issues are. anything long-term effects mild cases outside anecdotes? trying figure true risk young, healthy person head back work, etc. know freak outcomes, interested whether it’s probable all. lot things made sense pre-Internet anymore.

Like university. College make sense anymore, traditional education outdated. Dissemination information following interpretations handled remotely. could field student questions day, instantly, anywhere globe.

We need new degree, College whole needs reorder priorities cater online classes non-traditional education pathways (ie stop wasting time money core classes irrelevant speciality). Education due overhaul reflects higher speed flexibility humanity consumes information. Herd mentality right? Baaa problem happening everywhere, especially stores dropping restrictions number people masks

so basically never going end even months past vax becomes available

at least six months hell people can't stop selfish

November like July surge can't expect everyone around pander want it. called living society. guess people buy CNN's hysteria. Rock Florida. really saddened hear this. job stressfull enough, pandemic hits. Yeah going happen here. cant get people mask now. “I’m scientist, think know scientists.” FTFY. Democracy + covid elimination happen (here Aus, eg) island nation helps++, also attitude everyone sacrificing freedom bit short term get job done. month ago state: 600+ cases daily. Today: 5 cases. restrictions lift soon.  fucking blows mind dudes comment highly upvoted. people think like depressing, maddening, upsetting.

*I wouldnt permanently fucking disabled werent fucks like him*

They start change tune shit starts affecting them. then, act like none serious. God damnit hope get whats coming them. work pharma/biotech industry I'm familiar drug development process. industry may pull rabbit hat get vaccine everyone next summer, that's something us counting on. We'll give best, there's still lot go wrong. Two Women better IMO, much wheat Spotted Cow friend test negative twice spite COVID-like symptoms (trouble breathing even symptoms diminished, non-smoker).

Who's charge country? people believe earth flat, covid/mask hoax, climate change influenced carbon emissions. surprise people understand could disrupt ecosystems. Floriduh can’t anything right. one brought comorbidities, give obese example. took piss point.

Comorbidities obese, also people health conditions like cancer, asthma can't control health condition.

Sacrificing can't go eat burger inhumane fuck. that, what's point society? 

You guys American soft fuck. can't give burgers haircut couple weeks save country citizens. think lift mask guideline *quite yet*, happy see restrictions lifted bars. there's something going lot high risk ppl probably can't even get vaccine bodies might even able handle it. sure know immune compromised ppl able to. Yup. We're never going get April back, we're never going get January-March back. would say smell rat, haven’t able smell anything days. Weird. like specificity.

Not ""a lot"" experts.

""Exactly number""

The man clearly done research. Why...is Florida? lmao Milwaukee here, 60% people see stores nose-showing, chin-strapping straight wearing masks. There’s repercussions. Plastering signs doors saying “no mask, service” doesn’t mean shit employees aren’t even following directive. state doesn’t care anymore. thinks he’s gonna President  bother? covid taught anything people say care, fucking don't. caught people know I've treat differently. friends parents want friends hangout cause think I'll get it. Politics idiots, want give girlfriend hug honestly...shit want live peace die alone. Life wasted living. going know side wrong, listen hear points. always say afterwards they're full shit, can't say listen evidence. Good thing several vaccines similar late stages development use variety differing methods. means actually identifying community transmissions narrative it’s meat plants, prisons old folks false. obvious.  countries states. I'm talking terms defined English, personal preferences. entire reporting seems fishy. 

Are really clinical trials India infected hospitalized patients they’re giving conventional medicine others ayurvedic remedies? Let em die. US third wave idiots. Let em die wish people best luck case. Im low risk group, get vaccine high risk people recieved it.

So I'm putting life hold point. think realize normal go back to. clear matter waiting set period time go back things before. People, least smart, try put measures place thing like happen again. covid, covid showed us vulnerable unknown disease. Honestly, likely lucky deadlier would likely dead rate spreads.

E.g. Spain, France even mask pioneer Czech Republic first country Europe achieve 100% mask usage one worst numbers Europe. Meanwhile countries like Sweden zero mask usage one lowest infection rates Europe simple. Maybe read article. Why? Can't provide covid free report? lol maybe gov't shouldnt allow everything open? think tests done samples. scientists know sample covid Not. rational everyone get vaccine immediately vaccines bullet proof defense. know exactly effective vaccines yet. He's merciful. He's going let us hook time enjoy next summer. again. thousands years development, somehow humans still can't rid ugly habit denying science. tell me, people come tell me, sir, ""no-bell"". ""no-bell"" prize, believe that? even give bell anymore. bell. Obama got bell. do-nothing Democrats, they'd never give bell, right? job we've done bells, just, get credit it. we've done incredible job. travel, wear masks, pretty safe now. No, opposite. Coronavirus (like viruses) stable long lasting lower temperatures. Around 12°C ideal.  \*countries

A vaccine suddenly make 100% safe go odd people say “once get vaccine life go back normal”. vaccine might lessen symptoms people might still able infect others. 

To clear, personally live much always think people too. point vaccine magic fix might well get life. How's Disneyland doing? second wave November going horrible. EVERYONE COVID, long take taste/smell again? CANT TAKE Totally agree thought ended Easter like trump said would (sarcastic) way could everything right, die aneurysm know about. Tragedy strike anyone.

Permanently giving best years life tiny risk seems ridiculous, individuals make call level risk want take. Yeah relatively minor annoys hell persistent narrative supposedly proven. 

Also track trace need testing capacity test came contact without symptoms (so tested current policies). 
They could demand (like masks shops) right first get act together part demanding things citizenry. conspiracy theorists know also anti-VAXXERS. agree probably won’t get even though Trump pushing vaccine hard. History repeats idiots never learn. Anyone definitively tells “yes” “no” talking ass. 

If viable vaccine approved next month two, there’s chance wide distribution underway March at-risk populations getting first. That’s tipping point society start relaxing bit. 

March-April hopeful goal. It’s possible certain.  english awful know thank you. try practice improve it.

I think also could mix different factors + tick cases. sick People get tested, severe strain virus (which resulsts hospitilization) cases. big difference result, shit Mountain garden rising. countries mandated masks early complied (Argentina, Morocco, Philippines...) still throes covid, that's reason. say panic reason concerned dismiss seriousness Covid19.

Distance key. Hygiene key. Masks aren’t helpful u keep distance hygienic. comes mask last measure protection, first measure. 

No think knowledge outdated. symptoms seem equal minimal viral load 

If symptoms start , viral load increases, thus stay home though, that's got downvotes. Good hear, hope cases keep decreasing. Let know 25% it- states, we're less 10%. Oh 25% it, 75% haven't. weird thing say. matter propaganda sleeve. Besides things people already mentioned, airborne viruses remain potent air longer dry weather, people low vitamin (less sunshine) susceptible illness. hope best them, potential really explode India affect entire population due density

Hearing months since pandemic started yet dailing cases India decreasing two weeks. people pushing narrative never concerned mental health now. would mental health like even worse response millions dead disabled? wish anyone America cared all. There’s police walking around without masks, literally one cares India disgusting overpopulated, also highest rate rapes per capita. Hopefully rapists die. Looks like guardian fixed it. It’s bad reddit doesn’t allow titles edited, especially factual errors. title post uses “illuminated” past tense. Nothing “illuminated” yes does. get head goddamn ass. even want attend wedding Lol wat matter propaganda side.

That mean everyone figured wears one!


Except still seem waiting Hoax Flu disappear Easter like miracle! Yeah, that’s happened. version flatten curve really plateau. remember flatten curve drawings look like, look like plateau back side. Let’s get real. Remindme! 3 weeks need describe ""near 100% accurate"" better. sleeping dog never identified traveler covid nearly 100% accurate? scary. keeps reminding Stand. Heard many stories people sicker they’ve ever December January. hands dry sanitizer using. mental illness pandemic hasn’t addressed meaningful way results tragic :( I’ve bad thoughts man tested negative imprisoned anyway. contraption consisting food wraps rubber band. That's problem. mask helps you. mask helps me. So, surrounded idiots wear die, screwed. could immunocompromised kid barely leave house. worth risk. Everyone US be. election isn’t decided landslide, it’s going civil war.  There’s lot value using data collected military think trends American society whole. It’s technique that’s used many times success. 

W/regard mental health covid era, data correspond well surveys non-military Americans. Declining mental health past 8 months something concerned about. source, articles I've seen based Aus, deaths general went due people house, driving, drinking... Add we've fewer covid infections long shot, increase that, follows would fewer hospitalisations like there's fewer flu deaths. Lol, June 28th poll, masks hard control.

Covid lot better control Norway, Finland, Denmark, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, economies go need learn live reasonable precautions


Masks reasonable precaution.



A large portion U.S. refuses follow reasonable precautions. defense service workers: they're probably fucking dead inside point; may little support enforce policy management; even management support customers shitty cause unneeded stress get combative masks; one establishment right, another won't. Reality check: low wage service workers frontline policing masks, paid enough society fucked putting position begin with. 

Does make right? No, John Schmoe Nose-Dangler giving workers shit asking cover up, *he's problem probably one killing worker's resolve*. worker's also fault? Yes, granddaddy fault literally whole society willing kill indirectly mainline fucking cheeseburger without mask Denny's street.

Again, pose question: policing mask policies essence underclass, that's societies fault putting charge begin with.

It's shit way down. Americans stubborn we'll kill admit we're wrong, jesus christ history prove it. p-prepare f-for long term lung brain damage Karen! :((((( I’m California stage 1 longest. states stage 3. Everyone wears mask public. Half business still closed. dine outdoor seating barely tables restaurants. schools still online. It’s people hang get comfortable wear mask. Isn’t 15 days stop spread? It’s 6 months. that’s downside use case. They’ve already dismissed liberal hoax.

They need economic numbers. lockdowns? think mean restrictions, no? coincidence see beaux fifth video Florida reopening too? live state Australia multiple days without single positive detection; excessive social isolation early worked. guys shat bed early calling hoax you’re well truly fucked.

Sorry buddy going lot dead friends due outlook.

I’ll offer “Rest Peace” inevitably need it. I’m sorry stance blind danger it’s late.

Get ready next wave There's stupid Florida stupid. two states also ones coming local Vermont town ruining things locals? It’s scary lot black neighbors friends falling too. many think it’s conspiracy. I’ve seen cutting wire masks it’s 5G antenna that’s causes it. Could totally see racist white people starting conspiracy. lot misinformation spread modern day small pox blankets given Native Americans Man never want hear authoritarians say give fuck people's mental health ever cheering shit like Unfortunately think people thinking hardest come lol He's insane. cannot believe he's writing book ""amazing"" pandemic response pandemic he's experiencing \*potential\* 2nd wave moment.

I really hope AoC takes eventually. I’m citing Florida happened months ago NYC Wuhan.  Yeah well fuck you, kill elderly time go. heart. haha sneaked Yeah universities *really* fucked everything here. definitely concerned money communities. shame parents letting kids go live dorms shit, like wtf saying singular inflection point? offend you? pretty true. careful, wife 29 healthy. still knocked ass days. get lot rest, cousin 25 get ended hospital day 10. Made recovery thankfully. whoop Mickey's ass like im organization 13. wtf disney many studies relating homeschooling years regarding socialization anti-home school crowd likes always make argument. research bears home school children higher education levels, less depression, favorable attitudes learning attend college greater numbers. College age people home schooled self-motivated receive higher grades college traditionally schooled peers. trapped doors seems major contributing factor infections. Southern states cool down, people going outdoors. opposite Northern states. Best wishes y'all Midwest. going long winter. That's Cuomo delusional, thinks he's going president one day. Instructions unclear, imprisoned UK college students dorms well said curanreal. people repulsively useless idiotic. I’ve following rules (mask, socially distancing best go store/the time go public, hand sanitizer removing mask, disinfecting cards phone store trip etc) type story really scares me. people wearing masks are? Sorry curious.. Florida pretty unique property tax laws too. Veterans to.pay example. seriously understand “muaahh riigghts” stuff going western world. 

We pandemic everyone followed rules would done already. 

I living Thailand. shut down, banned tourism anyone coming undergo monitored 14 day quarantine. people even able come ghe first place due banned tourism etc. 

I heard Thais make fuss rules, westerners posting ridiculously would everywhere. 

We 0 community cases living lives almost usual. tourists allowed country hit economy countries shut hard, closed borders etc, world would pretty much done now. awhile, one cares God spoken. likely several years. know origins already, SCIENCE started! feel sorry people school. Even people graduated, fucked college experience told day live china anymore? Izghome? strawman? exactly happened lol. Leasure international travel like holiday etc, really banned though. understand important part many countries economies. 

I country (Thailand) fully banned tourism currently earning lot less money due this, yet care. 0 cases due strong policies worth more. 

I disagree “anyone” part statement though. believe still valid reasons international travel, albeit few. 

Think people stuck getting back country (yes exist). would also find travel dieing family member etc appropriate study work (where absolutely necessary). 

Those people travelling valid reasons undergo quarantine it. That’s done Thailand currently system work.   Sweet salty pair nicely matter thinking things can't get worse- course can. matter test trace isolate longer sufficient strategy governments pursue. people infected getting huge complications, really know work them. 
Some people saying big deal, small part infected. Forgetting obvious part ""a small part infected"" could you, wife/husband, parents, children, etc. 

A mask reduces number infected, guys saying ""don't worry, killing elderly giving complications random bigdeal, wear mask that's really important"". Assholes. tragic circumstance many healthy people suddenly died! condolences again. 
Tragic extremely rare. Take good care ! case wrong. Reinfection possible disease margin, including measles, concept herd immunity works quite well. Reinfection automatic disqualifier that. idea long immunity lasts, wayyy early proclaim short term light evidence qatar fishing boat studies. neutralize huge part vaccines advantage. need certain population saturation disease disappear go away. days virus mutates vaccines work may multiple doses involved efficacy immunity may temporary may need band annual trip. large population hanging around unvaccinated interactive, fuck vaccine benefits all. certainly right. going lot anger abject lack leadership many places, US federal government top list. Eh? right. given Environment plane, public aviable informations common sense enough people. 

Maybe right Flight 1% less catch coronavirus (1 100 still awful) also dishonest statement. flight, ok maybe guess? everything else?

Even appropriate precautions, relatively short domestic flight still carries moderate risks undertaken lightly. And, CDC notes (consider odds passengers becoming infected boarding, deplaning, public transport on) risks don’t begin end flight itself. also consider prevalence virus community community you’re traveling, risk severe illness COVID-19 risks vulnerable members household, quarantine requirements destination return home. 

I think know statement (when right) misleading benefit.

Sorry english.  Literally nothing wrote true Actually, wondering common coronaviruses would activate secondary cytokine storm response Covid vaccines people organ transplants. Lol okay think it’s time block bad faith actor Nope, three healthy. one friend even died home Fitbit still on. feel well said going lie couch. husband came home found there. 

I exposed since stayed away due pandemic &amp; parents at-risk. probably caught work. worked IT, also cashier weekends &amp; husband essential worker. friend nurse. dad's nurse probably exposed hospital. 

It happen anyone tho. I'm young I'm risking dying permanent complications. Look Nick Cordero Michael Ojo. 

And say, ""Oh survival rate high,"" remember people's friends families still ones dying. Would flippantly saying ""only many people died big deal"" people loved dying? Somehow doubt it. 

Remember 200,000+ died US. people loved ones. Somewhere friends family mourning loss. friend died home left behind 6 year old, mother battling cancer without daughter side. 

You might okay statistic, loved ones affected sincerely doubt apathetic. I’ve right whole time. People get mad say hit anti maskers head bat though Yes, Mexico example 47k Covid deaths 122k excess deaths year (by August 1st). That's 2.5x reported number.

Excess mortality scale happening places really heavily hit Covid. second stage clinical trials*

The third stage next. 1 million die motor vehicle accidents too. about? make iota sense. seem butthurt care person know nothing about. stupid you? East Texas here, people shopping Walmart without masks one says thing. recommendations, others laws. many cases following recommendations FHM crime. It’s home (which bad enough it’s own) even stay home likely visits friends / family isolating home. isolate spread it. Oh conspiracy nut jobs go crazy! cant stop posting MSN articles? one sad nothing. Also, remember Westerners ignored information China ridiculed early days epidemic?
Now making mistake.
That's say Westerners really hopeless.
Have heard short story ""The Man Condom"" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov? Globally, Europe, even poorer countries, way global average comes living standards, education, healthcare, etc.

Austria ranks pretty damn high Europe-wide, top that. Wow that’s insane. think positive rate Germany around 1 % weeks months now. 

Do states test patients Symptoms? It’s pretty simple, either care problem judging comments it’s clear thing come try score imaginary internet points trying write gotcha 
comment really relevance post. 

Fuck loser dumb American never thought that. think he'll lose much weight dies? released? see google maps app, least Europe (and really good, least checked yesterday yesterday regions info big, like Germany Spain shows state/comunidad autonoma level, France UK country level) *"" got underlying health issues ""*

That always gets people say that. 
I can’t imagine incredible amount lab work would figure out. lot people clear symptoms illness unable get clear diagnosis series tests, hell could person symptoms know don’t anything? would require sooooo many tests. Kill eat rich Anyone traveling internationally right now, unless one shit show another, put bunk bed barracks 40 days. care. tell Chinese decimate shark population someone child 08 crash. Children starved abused murder based personal experience. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
I live one 19 largest Class hospitals Beijing, next China-Japan Friendship Hospital.
I've lived 35 years, since born raised.
Guess gets first-hand information? quarantine international travellers pandemic imprisonment. don’t understand u want say. U started long term effects u talk loved ones? travelling? island restricted COVID live normally. whole nation suffer travellers bothered wait posh hotel couple weeks. God privilege petulance tone. Still make sense expect care cousin, know nothing except serves US military. Yep really bad virus back Feb (not covid) it’s still fucking around. It’s like people forgotten viruses bad “just virus” thought couldn’t hate anything “peeps” are. billionaires wealth grows third period.. So, soon herd immunity? worry, I'm going imagine much longer. people encouraged vote. Oh I’m sorry thought post mental health service members, silly Remedial classes already common college university. Germany Poland. COVID.

*SARS-2 Melbourne tried letting people isolate houses, something like 50% home police checked them... they're middle another massive lockdown.

I'll take free hotel day week. even though numbers totally inaccurate, long term impairments astonishing. thinks life return semi-normally summer 2021, pandemic end much later. Bit click-bait headline Bill actually thing. Quoted “The end epidemic, best case, probably 2022. 2021, numbers, able drive down, take global approach,” 

The fact COVID-19 going us year newsflash point. Well rates better Cali's NY's care cousin's well being? know single thing him. 1% chance catching there's 1 10000 chance dying single flight. might sound like much chance dying flight 1 30 million. 3000 times risk dying plane crashing. 1% chance catching there's 1 10000 chance dying single flight. might sound like much chance dying flight 1 30 million. 3000 times risk dying plane crashing. Long term masks going MUCH larger part daily U.S. culture, think. No. Hong Kong (the island) British colonial territory. parts mainland support infrastructure leased. Without support infrastructure, keeping colony became unfeasible, thus British decided give island away. Canada-US never closed before. lifetime situation. pandemic finite amount time. It'll get better. 

Given massively US fucking up, take time amount open borders intercountry travel occur. can't imagine America giving away 1000 people land worth 10s millions strategic location.

Every empire eventually falls due hubris. America already going down, new contenders rise. fallen empires tend break apart lose military might. state 1700 cases 58 deaths. Currently hundred cases nobody hospitalized. locked March - schools, restaurants, bars gyms closed. statewide mask mandate. Schools rotating students hybrid schedule. given option reopen gyms cafeterias, chosen keep closed. Restaurants open very, limited capacity.

We share anti maskers, least they're common. people showed lockdown protest March. think able handle assuming daily rates plateau start drop. states around us ok get help needed. honestly mostly ICU nurses critical resource here. Problem every state problem triage. 

Biggest issue full hold surgeries require ICU care. Open hearts, big neuro surgeries, etc. patients also wait. pandemic chief he’s better seems like care know mean. rain season get worse. soon rain stops turns winter, outdoor seating available cozy again. trying keep positive. Yep, thinking along lines too. Trouble many people don’t really get math think 99% safe like 100% safe. Prior COVID flew roughly 100 flights per year. could expect get every year average? exactly reassuring. still going 6 months one. would like see statistic. Germany data support this. It’s like 24% 21000 icu ( thus 4165). could add article it’s German unfortunately adenovirus vaccine like Oxford/AZ. anyone explain differences effective one shot AZ two? big chance also cause neurological autoimmune issues? Hong Kong leased. Everyone knew situation hundred years leading re-unification. 

The Canada-US never closed before. lifetime situation. pandemic finite amount time. It'll get better. 

As Canadian Vancouverite would absolutely accept Point Roberts Canada people live reason. want live American Canadian soil. Many Americans live job opportunities Vancouver want stay American soil. would resistance. 

I can't imagine America giving away 1000 people land worth 10s millions strategic location. country organized Berlin Airlift, keep thousand people peninsula fed year. willingly giving away good land full American citizens strategic location continental United States seem American character? me. unprecedented. Americans wanted swap Canadians, tell 1000 Canadians would revolt. haha that's hillarious... 1 personne 7 earth chinese believe none covid rest planet can't stop spread reveal BS chinese numbers are. 
Belgium 11 millions inhabitant ( 1/100th chinese population) cases china 1 billion people... right majority seems good 

There's problem.jpg 

I care good 99% care loved ones ends shitty 1%. 
If wear mask longterm consequences, unknown non-zero chance shitty health forever? Yup, going wear mask! /half-s Sad, true. Wee decent moderate Dem governors, state hardened red lean. think meant people like trying convince people, like mother, given up. I’m done caring stupid people point. get sick, what. die, it. want do, feel bad stupid? Yell them? I’m done. I’ve given up. drunk cousin cry shoulder 2AM virtue signaling. 

Let's hope mask seems like 2 forgot social distancing. long consistent guess.

Don't worry it.
From 35-year-old office worker born raised Beijing. Yes madness. Everytime someone makes comment like downvoted hell. wonder CCP bots really silly people education history conflate suspicion China Trump.

The communist regime terrible record telling truth humanitarian catastrophes occurred inside China since foundation. regularly rewrite history erase uncomfortable truths. would people think covid would different? lock-downs big impact death tolls.

Yes do. US fully implemented proper lockdown/mask graph would look much better. 

The increase deaths overwhelming ICU complications impact issues. test rates stay ""low""? 

I personally get tested unless showing numerous covid symptoms literally coughed face someone tested positive covid. 

How states testing people 99% tests negative? people getting tested need to? eat ass One thing surprised wasn’t talked improving teleconferencing set up. wife talks people zoom day work made really nice set hd camera, ring light, even second hand flatscreen tv feel like zoom calls person. Bad faith argument. Obviously, situation present.  what... thats crazy talk... OMG .. right loose money opening bars think.

The bars spreads virus, people stay away everything. Bars generate enough jobs worth screw everything else keep open. Florida also opening everything back up. starting roll things back again. true Holy mother forking shirt balls. bad place. means prevent deaths science. point study 1932? change giving cure? Masks vaccine. large gatherings. know, combatting spread virus. see friends family, one telling limits. told safe take precautions, that's all. thing whine sports bars similar things.

If can't maintain personal connections lack imagination fault, efforts curtain massive pandemic. Pick fucking phone drop victim mentality. everyone shares beliefs.

Yeah know. There's ton selfish assholes world believe social lives important health others.

Not everyone shares grossly inaccurate misconceptions danger virus. Microstates not, wish tweak metrics suit narrative look whole picture bits. can’t “india better based 100k people” ignoring countries way worse US using comparison. can’t pretend everything absolute worst US nowhere else moving goal posts. flu killed 50 million people 1918-1919. Sounds pretty dangerous find hard take someone seriously pronounces word ‘genuine’, “genuaine” 🤷🏼‍♂️😉but quite entertaining gossipy girl, isn’t echoing comment here. little three days without drink, things start get realigned. Five days sober you’ll notice difference happiness. really preach sobriety, encouraging break. first long break first lockdown felt better. 

Alcohol depressant. Remember that. Isn’t death rate low kids tested go class?? Well, said June 5th.

And read full statement, I’ll link, you’ll note masks recommended part host strategies, specifically mentioned something worn areas community transmission highlight exact type mask worn.

Because masks work.

 says alone won’t work mask 100%, even “moon suit.” get sick function quality mask vs viral load exposed to.

N95, yeah around ton virus long time.

Level one surgical mask, around virus short amounts time.

Well made multi layer cloth mask, seek minimize exposure short jaunts medium distance.

It’s easy understand.

Masks work, mask usage additive efforts, place would say it’s country’s wealth prospective. course wealthy countries affording vaccinate more. know of. Doesn’t stop plaguewalkers acting like herd immunity natural process virus goes through. Crazy covid stuff works, huh holy shit! people reddit access vaccines long time anyway. 

An EUA likely restrictions limit access high risk populations. serve Phase 4 trial, tons public information available ever even get opportunity. Wis.

Young people risk flu. super super downplaying elderly risk Covid flu. numbers don’t lie. someone ""have sex"" demon...? One unfortunate consequence US regards studies placebos somewhat unethical. they'll test one high blood pressure medication vs another control group, rare placebo control.

The Lancet, British interesting results. discovering $40,000 shows benefit placebo many cases may fact convenient medical industry way pays fee yet sham surgery studies rarely done, especially U.S., ethics boards resist subjecting patients incisions, anesthesia risks without delivering actual treatment. Redberg, written value studies, takes opposite view: “I think unethical them.” Otherwise may exposing millions people risks financial costs surgery placebo effect likely  plenty Americans right thing: staying home, going essentials, avoiding contact people. idiots deny go regular life reason good Americans right thing long time. feels good see idiots suffer consequences actions. spike 75,000/day U.S. back July, completely nuts. metric? European countries (that microstates - San Marino Andorra 95 deaths them) death toll/100k higher US Spain Belgium. 

US significantly ahead France fatalities per 100k (63 vs 48.6). Qatar has, uh, 7.6 deaths per 100k. really see Democrats win Florida party masks lockdowns unless state totally collapses Covid infections next 30 days till election. history black Americans mistreated doctors medical researchers goes back long Trump current incarnation GOP. doctors reason advocate community public health standpoint regardless current affairs. Science takes longer Foxnews figure things out. admit mistakes learn.

UK style lockdown before? believe Florida fudging numbers also believe NJ fudging numbers. Eroded guy commits tax fraud owns microphone. Tbh september thought virus dying. Little news new cases. now. Grab popcorn folks sit back enjoy show early right say percentage lingering effects.  fake news spread easily due lack information acess education noticed back March consider HIGHEST mental decline world seen long time.

I noticed affects anything requiring new thought (consciousness). memory.

So lack ability 'reason' something new already memorized.

Here anecdotal items press showing SEVERE lack reasoning skills. mistake small sample un-reasoning' happening alarming rate people might covid.

1. 4/24 CNN Dr. Sanjay Gupta Dr Lena Wen discussing Trump's injecting bleach light body. Cooper asked comment, Sanjay delays 10 seconds ask Dr Wen 'what think' instead IMEDIATE 'sodium hypocloride must NEVER invested, PERIOD'. Watch clip here: 4/28 Andrew Quomo news conference thanks people sending cloth masks health workers. shows everyone board masks pinned thimbtacks thru mask. (INCLUDING doctors working John Hopkins, staff, reporters). ONE person thought call tacking mask ruins it! saw pins immediately pause disbelief!

3. March: Dr Fauchi Chris Todd show asked Todd know flattened curve. KNOW!!! Instead explaining 7-day curve looking dips down, said Todd 'it's hard basically failed. He's VIROLOGIST. simple question simple answer appeared mental distress (slightly) easy question. Watch tape.

4. 9/21 Trevor Noah: Dr Fauchi again. asked take mask courses, said PUT MASK CHIN! kid not. CDC guidelines (which influences) CLEARLY say never this. WORSE, brags time saying touch front mask, slides TOUCHING NOSE FRONT MASK it.

This UNFORGIVABLE jeopardized MILLIONS lives advise bad, laughable.

So yes, I'm calling Fauchi someone affected brain inflammation. meant HARM simply unable 'reason'

LAST: Almost 30% everyone pass store sidewalk trail problems basic collision avoidance. entire life I've walked medium slow ballistic trajectory easy predict. pre-pandemic. think people always 'think about' collision avoidence instead follow trivial formula species use avoid moving one another, ZIG ZAG try look eye misguided way seemingly ask 'left right' . Hesitating way never saw extent Something wrong consciousness much human race notice have. call 'great, rapid dimming' Guys. Pres. Trump ain't lab playing bleach bright lights trying tinker vaccine formulation.

Yea right sure isn't, bet believe drones call ""birds"" real /s Yup, Emergency care net loss hospitals. Hip replacements, hernia fixes, joint surgeries, etc... high margin hospitals. US citizen here, condescending point me, enraging think wealthy country like US shit healthcare system almost everywhere else sounds way better. completely agree you, think it’s important know spiked ~75,000 cases/ day back July, never got ~20,000 cases/day September. say point never got control new rise expected, health officials’ worst fears winter starting look like path on. 205k dead today. No, removed law longer recognize law. That’s bad. headline obviously attention seeking, group isn’t immune politics, valuable service. They’re getting physician scientists validate FDAs work effort improve vaccine uptake African American communities. inevitably going go people coming state go shore good chunk idiots following guidelines around state UofI developed saliva based testing thats super fast accurate. undergrads required get tested twice week. got results 5 hours yesterday. Sir, Wendy’s. Trending slightly, nowhere near Florida levels, that's even Florida fudging statistics make look better. NJ still 2% positive rate tests. Florida 5% still dividing people positive total number tests- lowers value (to get true value total positive tests divided total tests given positive people people tested. comparing similar data way it) received test months ago. little finger prick waited 20 minutes hear back them. incredibly misleading. fact, home nation responsible health matters. England changed death count methodology follow rest UK. Public Health England classifying anyone tested positive Covid eventually died Covid death, even unrelated. Guardian saying Tory govt overestimating, sure is. surprise circlejerk comment appear, despite article literally saying tests already approved hundreds millions bought governments world. genuinely good news. People Sweden go restaurants. know not......smh saw saw past months city live in, NJ, know second wave going happen. People started mask nose thing, often I'm seeing people without masks going stores nobody stopping them, outside bars restaurants open without really distancing. gonna come back here. population dense come back percentage (20% idiots here, based looking around) people right thing can't even get admit DeSantis shut state lol chance hell could get understand anything actual virus. Houston's Moderna trial attempting get diverse populations trial, hopefully

My state late stage 3 trials vaccine. crazy restrictions placing (i.e. open ""the public""). get prescribed inhaled steroid certain mcg, disqualifies participating study. 

Since public release vaccine comes stage 3, exactly people category going included study estimate back February American deaths covid 1 million people see viable vaccine. 9 months see reason lower estimate. Guaranteed India far worse reported though. See actually agree that. lockdown US accomplish basically nothing except hurting businesses employees. Because:

1. lockdown half hearted, uniform across country, accompanied enough testing enforced well enough. failed aim getting infections low, manageable level.

2. Businesses (and people) didn’t get adequate financial support government. Obviously everyone gets locked home two months, it’s going destroy many businesses. Australia government paid everyone’s wages period lockdown gave massive financial support businesses. lockdown ended things pretty much picked left off. US everyone got thrown single $1500 less check ... good luck fun!

So yeah, lockdown indeed achieve nothing useful US. Common knowledge isn’t universal knowledge. It’s reasonable ask someone they’re aware something existence seems undercut point trying make. trying analogize deaths disease multiple times less contagious multiple times less dangerous acceptance unnecessary deaths 1-2 million people course 12-18 months? seem think two different, strongly indicates sociopathy part, least, inability process simple logic. Except like flu. easy life would took medical advice medical professionals instead ~~media outlets.~~ politicians.

FTFY Lol that's true. get fined cases. Yeah. quote mentioned nothing promise

Wake kinda TL:DR translation explanation: 


Czech health minister Prymula, military doctor proponent harsh measures ask wednesday state emergency declared. prime minister interior minister support pretty much guarantees pass.

&amp;#x200B;

With 3k daily new infections per 11M country, officially considering (aka approved) restriction free movement restriction number people citizens allowed meet british style. Unofficially, people expect lockdown hammer fall near future, week two.

Absolute TL:DR - fucked Plenty classmates (who rich lot 1st generation American's) qualified TOPS. wealthy ones. 43 percent recipients households 6 figure incomes.

So what? worked hard earned it. everyone wealthy background parents pay college tuition. know many, many whose parents outright refused help them. used exclusively help lower income folks 

This program poor people. Again, graduate high school 2.5 GPA, belong college. school also partnership local trade school. tools there. Students use them. 

You help people want help themselves.  Maybe 🤔 ACME way **Global initiative supply 120m rapid antigen tests low- middle-income countries** 

Article sub-title. think US would qualify low- middle-income Wealthy countries signed Access Covid tools initiative (ACT accelerator), UK has, also able order tests. initiative launched March **by WHO**, [European Gates Foundation French government. 

Wait... dear leader withdraw us WHO?

Tell US going screw up? Thanks info guy Seems like lot petty gloating posted last days.... that's pretty low. 


""Man neighsaying gets covid dies"" 


Its safe assume everyone group takes seriously, right? bad taste. really dense can't understand tolerating intolerant? It’s libtards’ fault. Stupid fucks want everyone feel “accepted” dumbest reasons. Smh country virus began necessarily mean country hit hardest, right, especially considering possible mutations later strains, may make virus contagious compared original one. Better now, Bought Sanitizer spray, helps like sanitize clothes. Well written article demonstrate affected pandemic, directly indirectly. Yep im also Missouri. I’m Kansas City people wear mask correctly(I seen majority do). go 20 mins kc one even wears get st.Louis. rural areas Missouri getting hit extremely hard coronavirus! Hopefully make realize mask work actually wear them. again, even file police report. racial slurs likely never even happened. bet dumbass already infected matter anymore, it?  take care babies know cries about, know it’s about, definitely organized thoughts. People know want even don’t. partly fox well, catering towards infant-minded individuals see people cultures like broccoli think might ‘gross.’ You’d complete idiot, arguing good faith argue isn’t horrible. logic using interrogation first place cuts Hannity’s argument even starts. it’s horrible, would use force people talk? found alcoholic possibly fathom getting shit faced strangers every weekend.

What's like zero personality? could ask u same. again, always exceptions like ones u stated also large number People affected significantly 

So I’m referring RKI data (the German cdc) 
286,338 known cases. however assumed real infection rate 11-20 higher official test numbers show simply everyone tested especially asymptomatic. makes estimated number real infected roughly 2.8 4 million people whereas deaths amount 9539 cases. Yes, everyone telling going sports bars important life indeed self-centered, unrealistic, selfish. Thanks understanding morally bankrupt people place social life ahead actual life. caught virus? what? point, long ago thread was: 
""First: Sweden **NOT** going introduce lockdowns, regional local restrictions; second: enough examples countries bad situtation now, despite harsh lockdown (Spain, France, UK)."" 


I never said less. Sweden lockdown, going introduce them. early August: “It’s sort like one-two punch,” Fauci said. “It’s conceivable cells you’ve made response couple years ago — three, four, five years ago — exposed relatively benign coronavirus causes common cold, could actually hang around, you’re exposed SARS-Coronavirus-2, could degree protection,” said, referring novel coronavirus. flu + covid time major factor Italy? would thought flu got washed sheer numbers. 

Whether there's cross-immunity surprised factors play though. People get flu vaccines (in North America anyways) tend ones cushy enough jobs take bit time off, even vaccine day nurse comes workplace. played game weekend gave finger every Trump sign saw. Lets say drove one hand Appleton. say that. said maybe good idea make statements evidently true, several variants virus evade antibodies. mutation crucial evade antibodies. 

With scientists seemingly trying calm peoples minds telling things get disproved shortly afte cause people trust anymore, also possibly lose trust vaccine. Unfortunate. feel many fellow americans look think ""Ha, least thats us!""... Im surrounded idiots. Mmm, indeed troubling. Less 1% population dies life goes on. Kinda like Cancer Aids. Eventually people forget Corona Virus. okay, would thought clear context.

What acceptable level covid death US assessed you? article about. Money. biased like hell too. mention +50% infected suffering long term health issues. QUALY increase there? Oh know wrong laugh, never get tired seeing exact story over... okay little bit tiring :( least Arizona pretty active campaign encourage people wear masks. Probably 1/5 YouTube adds see lately adds encouraging people AZ wear masks. gun store seems people wearing masks too. Making every single element political, moment realise demographics/cities affected, agencies they'd already run ground guise making govt look incompetent, crush it.

Sad thing is, many probably see confirming views govt can't anything right. going vote govt seeing ~~incompetent are~~ effective self-sabotage? could scam, better call racial slurs! Vaccine rollout. Gee wonder Better yet, soap clean water, use instead. fucked man 60% new cases found people 40. So, yeah... Yes it’s simple, getting someone make change simple. People underestimate amount consume overestimate amount burn. People unhealthy habits hard break restrictive diets don’t counter underlying causes those. Kudos making change, sounds awful lot like telling alcoholic “just stop drinking, it’s simple!” Ya social aspect isn’t painful all. Oh wait redditors don’t socialize think everyone else fine binge watching Netflix playing video games day That's awesome! Short show, couldn’t take second shot grandmother Same. Hope well.

The error referring to, I""ve said, headlines claim causation established. there's huge backlog? good thing? Whole foods, plant-based, oil king! 6 months, able eliminate 2 blood sugar meds blood pressure meds. Husband 6 month follow-up cardiologist eliminated statin drug. lost combined 100lbs 6 months. Don’t know states know South Dokota 6% it’s hospital beds taken covid patients /r/iamverybadass comment? reply profoundly made ipact. Maybe elective procedures shut down, overblown fear hospitals paranoia? I’m buying excess death theory. There’s many variables make calls. you, definitely talking ass. standing walgreens tiny waiting area 15min surrounded unmasked people walgrees refuses kick worst part CDC lost credibility claimed cigarettes cause cancer way back 1958. You’re right, they’re self-centered, unrealistic childish. Unless asymptomatic, COVID typically bring flu-like symptoms. played game back state declared emergency. Never again! least million people dead - including countries poor testing/underreporting whatever.

""Stupidly low"" - little empathy have? asshole. could post multiple articles every day different child dying lifelong complications flu. this, people would scared ever leave house. But, never hear vast majority go fully recover.

You’re comparison makes zero sense. Yeah, try know horrible. I've seen video looks awful. High doses (15,000 IUs) Vitamin D3 better, cheaper, available, saver. get attention pharmaceutical company expect make money it. take job department local hospital idk 1-3 years - highly likely get infected? physical department located within actual hospital. obviously openings healthcare right (and long-term unemployed Autism spectrum) hypertension another risk factor. wore tight fitting non-cloth face mask, kept canister PDI wipes/Purell desk still highly likely become infected due air supply?

I realize difficult question without 100% answer. thoughts appreciated! may know nurse there. mortality rate, last heard. sort risk stratification question. Trying weigh employment vs risk. opinion matter topic. shit. I’m commenting person me. apparent even vaccine people still wear masks social distance 🤷‍♂️ Y’all wanna join Canada? Good point. hourly headlines stating hospital beds running low improving. name least carries lot weight paying marketing Might well inject cleaning products, good measure. went school around Ann Arbor, MI, never realized quality education moved Mississippi. folks associate bachelor ""degrees"" local community college know algebra. Like, what? hated HS math teacher, never took anything past trig, consider mathematically illiterate, can't even calculus. But, no, I'm ahead. Holy shit. Hey man, someone drank heavily daily years say alcohol made things bleaker.

I still drink, daily caused depression anxiety get much worse doesn’t matter. Willing targets propaganda essentially cultists. simply don’t observe facts reason. teach ""real math"" keep secret rest us Sorry hear that! wish could something. Also news you: constantly working preventing deaths can, also. Remember former First Lady’s healthy eating exercise campaign? designed prevent hundreds thousands future deaths preventable heart disease, diabetes, cancer. EPA regulations Trump administration keeps repealing? Designed prevent deaths cancer illness polluted air water. Increased safety regulations cars? Push renewable, clean energy burning fossil fuels? Push increased plant diets? Hopefully makes sense now. even better, come congressional debate fucking snow ball say ""it's cold out!"" therefore global warming hoax! Takes lot booze keep conscious suppressed shit piss pants take nice long nap getting running away....you're Nancy, know it, know it...everybody knows it. liberal make up. Embrace late great Christopher Hitchens, Vanity Fair columnist generally far superior journalist, get waterboarded. IIRC stated torture felt drowned. video YouTube interested. Unfortunately lawsuit alone cost many face masks already, hope liable pay school/city. 15 million population, lot 700 turn 2000 fast. Whatever becomes individual assess risks acts. Many cases = around 6 7. one shot lockdowns ya blow one shot 🤷‍♂️ gunna 15% due Florida 3 weeks || Ena Respiratory raised AU$11.7m Australian investors and, subject successful || toxicity studies regulatory approval, company could ready test INNA-051 || human trials less four months.

Unfortunately takes &lt;= 4 months start trial. Still long haul research!! cocktail hour waiting room sound hear Americans collectively sighing relief us time.  dive bars die bars Someone set us Covid. ACE belong us  got recovered covid 19, symptoms days really felt hungry enough eat food, sometimes eat food day, may odd used wake pretty early like 3 4 am, maybe feeling lonely. took medicines anything honest, recovered automatically loss smell too.

I also Pneumonia couple months ago, maybe lungs developed little immunity guess. suggestion loss smell feeling hungry, chance Covid 19

Wear mask sanitizer. That's solution right now. I’m pacifist would happy breaking hand face repeatedly. even live US I'd sign that. Well okay, whatever hell want. complain.about works well ""inherent racism"", African Americans literally one last groups help vaccine trials ""they trust it"". want shoot foot? give shit. They're literally adding complexity problem that's going delay create division they're calling less. 



This shit stop. Colorado Springs. talking too. **IF** everyone wore mask met people person practiced good hygiene lockdowns would needed. 50 percent people around aren’t anything stop spread...it’s gonna keep spreading.

And I’m sure 40 percent refuse vaccine 🤷‍♂️ grasping straws now. ""substantial"" missing word ""anything"". doesnt take genius  “stock market” mean you? mean rich people suits Wall St getting money, smoking cigars laughing? mean strong stable healthcare system help fight virus? non-taxpayer. /s nightmares year become nothing ""being store realizing mask on, people either, I'm forced squeeze people""

In dreams, hold shirt face, hold breath, still feel like tell I'm getting infected.

Someone coughing aisles like background cough Plague, Inc. Everyone's calling rude prioritizing life enjoyment entrainment. one rude. that’s huge gamble governor making right now, won’t permanently taint state’s reputation send tourists elsewhere search places aren’t diseased. Oh boy. find incredibly strange/amusing receive hourly breathless updates case upticks turns radio silence metrics improve. Don’t worry, still monitor Florida/Texas/Arizona numbers even collective ADHD made us forget states exist anymore

I hope Midwest comes ok RIP FL. Again. people considered cooking kitchen home correctly assuming total 2150 people hospitalised per 100k confirmed? condescending fucking nonsense. People want get back work? shit. deadly pandemic. want lot things. Sometimes feel lame I’ve never party went til 9 Okay, bro. blame media Please don't, us decent people actually believe science facts masks whatnot. like governance perspective there? state still weekly briefings tremendous amount effort getting testing locations set up. lowest also theory prevents high viral load get virus, meaning catching low viral load may mean asymptomatic mild symptoms...and still develop level immunity it. makes sound fucking weird Doesn’t bode well issues like climate change ways get it. customer store 20 minutes, 8 hours Well, yeah, told stay home. “And go” Watch power exponential growth. Note doubling period gets going. mean offense, like it’s interesting friends seem fundamental differences values. mean, don’t know I’d call people value differences friends. Like “I get you’re wearing mask grandmother could die don’t care anyone else’s grandma, actually never mind don’t care either”. Yeah, I’m saying, friend interesting word  plan, need money RemindMe! three weeks  200k number inflated, look total deaths year vs last  Stuuuuurrrrrrgissssss.... hope fun. bunch jackasses. suspect look back kindly portion history.  ""people approve Trump"" demographic, fucking things everyone else False. county Minnesota doubling almost every day. Prove wrong, tell county, look cases. Lol every two weeks keep saying two weeks Bless hearts! Sending thoughts prayers. thought covid already zoonotic given came bat pangolin? Everyone goes inside. many parts US place see people winter indoors. I'm sure follow math that. GDP Q2 last year versus this? information available? School kids asymptomatic bringing home virus family? disagree, SARS didnt lock swiftly knew time. Remember COVID assumed 3.6% CFR planes still flying around globe increasing cases everywhere? SARS advantages getting contained Covid doesnt have. non infectious incubation period incubation period shorter two days average COVID's incubation period, gave authorities much better ability contact tracing isolating. Without two simple factors, probably would killed millions quickly. agree much higher death toll would caused much stricter lock downs drop deaths lucky SARS easier contain. mean like flu common cold? Oh, no! Again, lot Americans lost ability look things outside politics.
According you, Wuhan erupted, China refused aid countries spent money buy
But doctors patients Wuhan hospital still waiting use it. know local residents Wuhan donated civilian N95 masks local hospital?
COVID-19 medical issue, scientific issue, political issue
All nations must cooperate, even U.S. Soviet Union wiped smallpox together Cold War.

And still wondering whether buy supply give away.
If ask me, matter buy give away, matters solution.
Or else problem burn brightly. Aspen yesterday went grocery store (basically Kroger offshoot). police guy refused wear mask employee confronted him, popped open bunch beers poured floor. Toddler temper tantrums. safety given new CDC stats low death rates, destruction economy, questionable warp speed tested vaccines, balance cheered good thing assuming disease causes lasting immunity. also means tests aren’t wasted, used people disease high frequency time Florida fucked us 2000...and time 20th anniversary. Stupid assholes. missing joke? Nobel Noble lol Yup source? wanna share info people vaccinated people still risk though? problem theory immune response vaccine guaranteed. Yeah, sorry. senses evolved keep us alive. There's reason people born five senses. ancestors born without ONE survive pass four sense genes. certainly luxury could adapt live without. Living thumbs luxury could live job without them. send college kids back help spread disease hometown. Observation inspection null point. Like said, extrapolate data. **prove** people depressed whole? No, good conversation awareness. Coronavirus? Complete mental health concerns imo. way prevent without causing issues. win situation. Currently living Milwaukee really depend go. People areas closest actual city seem pretty well properly wearing masks. Outside gets bad quickly... Ran tiny market Waukesha County even signs door masks, went owner even wearing one working neither customers. know might want think stocking now? Anything might need aisles sick people going hang out. First off, *because* sick people going head there, there's chance virus air there. Secondly, want holding couple bottles, trying decide expectorant suppressant cough meds, there's chance sick person handling boxes.

Finally, know risk fomite transmission less originally thought, still happens. pick cough cold stuff now, stick closet let self-disinfect; wait need it, pick up, come home, decontaminate yourself, decontaminate meds, plus anything else might touched. actually lot work already dealing someone who's sick. [And yeah, get delivery, sometimes need wait slot, something want I'm ill.]

I started list cough cold aisle, branched first aid store first aid right next cough+cold. also got stuff got ill want buy decontaminate Gatorade illness-comfort foods.

I got: cough drops, Nyquil/Dayquil, Chloraseptic, aspirin, tylenol, antihistamines, bandaids, neosporin, spare bottle rubbing alcohol, Vitamin C, echinacea, zinc, multivitamins, herbal teas, regular tissues tissues aloe, elderberry syrup, Garlique. also picked extra toothpaste, spare toothbrush, dental floss, deodorant, *think* means avoid **entire** pharmacy department springtime. also got ramen applesauce (foods easy stomach get ill) couple packs Gatorade Ensure case worse illness.

Also, remember beginning pandemic New York, people horrifically low blood oxygen levels never knew it? already one, look getting pulse oximeter, reads blood oxygen levels. take mine day (random times), know ""normal"" range device. like objective measurement base decisions of, instead subjective ""how crap need feel go ER?"" Plus gives chance call healthline give *them* objective numbers give advice of.

Finally, store, everyone get damned flu shots. number reasons year, basically makes snd society safer, well lowering stress healthcare sector.

You stock toilet paper pasta want to, well, first priority making sure feel well, spend time *other* sick people hanging out, something see lot people considering. Case point sound like comprehension makes people...people. life breathing! I’m sorry hear that. Please stay safe. China this. I’ve decided even vaccine given think majority population it, still wear mask.
People complaining obviously never real problems. it’s 6 months probably 2 since mask became KIND mandated. 
Be considerate others. Yes sounds like poor choice said. 
Pot calling kettle black. reinforces whole “too much good thing bad you” cross border Canada. zero laws /s much IU take though? what's safe limit? What’s condom? assume susceptibility high, sure. Except not. we've known months not.

The PCR+ rate meaningless given circumstances. positive people dying hospitalized. Deaths hospitalizations peaked weeks ago Florida. we're entering flu season I'm sure portion COVID pandemic behind us continue manageable. watching model continue revised down. (people expect catastrophe) going explain models always end wrong. going interesting U.S less deaths universal mask projection, even though mask use half scenario play out. great idea! Get locals even infected snow birds definitely plop hospitals also!! Healthcare good right?? /s Doctors already learned better treat illness give drugs. That’s huge difference March.

I like optimism.  fucked. Still need wait next year yearly total  fox news talking point. point people virtue signaling make feel better. 

Are going way go talk vets help them? person argues Reddit selfish reasons. Hmmmmmm Yeah, probably right. mental health concerns. think comes good place believes post-covid future he's disconnected. Masks hard no. Social distancing... maybe different degrees. Im going party walk around car give another pedestrian space setup picnic right next anothers indefinitely.

Itd last measure case Californian Berkeleyan would literally start voting republican signing recall petitions democrats/scientists tried legislating raised believe life black white? two options exclusive all. 


Your questioning putting corner too. 


Because life important, would pay extra good equipment instead free donations historically faulty equipment. Life valuable looking good deals. 




To add it:

Because value life money, would avoid Chinese products. Chinese mask costs less Canadian Singaporean mask, life valuable pay little extra better masks. value life money, would consider Chinese car Korean, Australian, European car. 




I value life money. believe better Syria buy good equipment instead free donations. situation Syria makes hard buy good equipment. stick original lockdown protect hospitals. base safety Chinese ppe. say year student gets half-rate education. prepared next year.

I actually think effect overestimated. Kids get half rate education year would 0.55-rate education year. differences education quality already huge based location. moment think minimizing health effects important education. pandemic putting effort resources helping left behind necessary either way. Lol way, also conversation someone vitamin good take night close bed, stimulates brain, kind keeps up. heads up, learned that. Thematically anticlimactic - but, like everybody died. Yeah...

Why 3 upvotes straight wrong information? Thanks reddit... It’s south Florida. bars packed soon opened back Arkansas same. asked school nurse two separate occasions said can't tell me. refered school district wide website says general info updates every two weeks. writing poor borderline illiterate. ‘’it’s fire year old’ ‘should marker rock’. I’m embarrassed you. And, third grade teacher. mankind survived millenias without despite vulnerable many infectious diseases?

Because many want live environment close interaction among people encouraged instead something ashamed of, A.K.A. following natural instincts?

Because viable long term, limited capacity people everywhere due distancing kill businesses industries? tin hatty I'm saying case, happening right flu season looms SEEMS like they're purposely trying make worse/kill people live COVID life everyday work. I'm slurrping fiction literally see confirmed COVID pts look like. tell guy barely conscious tube throat everything fiction. Maybe person recovered COVID still feeling effects weeks later.

I'm also going absolutely insane isolation, unemployment, sheer hopelessness lack belief reason whatsoever wake morning rest hopefully short life, little compassion people. Loneliness hopelessness also quite literally deadly. comments obnoxious. also extracted poor people immigrants. Well...of course. Fall/Winter prime respiratory infections.

And USA 250 million people can't science. Literally COVID endemic America (never leaving). Best travel ban country forever. Leper colony. !remindme two weeks It’s capital efficient increases roi situation unfolding Wisconsin?

that situation reads *0 deaths*? completely baffles look comments posts subreddit. bot accounts? nothing ever good enough. ""Not enough people wear masks WAHHHHH"". theres, ""we vaccine anti maskers wont get WAHHHHH"". are, ""even vaccine isnt good enough, wear mask........WAHHHHH"". kind mindless drones believe EVERYTHING read? isnt place play God. Scientists trying centuries still cant get right. made organic matter, die time comes. Makes sense die free live enslaved told do. Gooood. lean-inventory strategy always setting us secondary disaster disaster actually struck. Saw cases Clorox wipe 3-packs getting unloaded Friday almost felt like maybe, maybe world would keep spinning.

I see single packs stock pretty often now. last long course guessing supply per store pretty flat here, possible. doesn’t minimize, delays.

I’m really bad place. emotions interests anything anyone, attachment.... words mean something me, thank you.

You’re kind care stranger like obvious major issues, appreciate hope hold me, it’s way mysélf... 

I hope mouth feels better soon eat decent food... People Florida aren’t going take advice. Floridian lifestyle COVID-19 can’t stop. ""I GET WATCH DIE. GUVN'R SAID SO."" understand slowing curve means decreasing cases avoid situation unfolding Wisconsin? one said wait vaccine except politicians. raising infections limited even stopped social distancing, masks, hygiene, etc. heads up: CDC updated lethality rate [far rate cited. went Walmart first time like 8 months today. dude took mask cough. bunch people regard personal space. rough.

It’s gonna get much worse. predictive timeline consistently short. takes time spread get rolling. Many people still reasonably careful. don’t think cases significantly impacted Halloween earliest, though school impacts may hit sooner lot thanks modern medicine. country median age casualties 60s, adults 50s died 80s. still lethal older people, really, oxygen tank ICU (which lacked :/) amazing. Hence fucking mask social distancing. people risk? ones need watch do, go, hide damn house. I'm living next year, more, life around people's ""possible"" risk factor. That's job, mine. 

Mask distance plenty. Want more? Fuck off. Hopefully ends anticlimacticly season 8 could respected argument ""happily wear masks"".

""happily"" fucking ass.

From point straight propaganda. Thanks Reagan Implying every virus SARS-CoV-2?

Can provide examples viruses shown short-term evidence damage multiple organ systems? well, bless little heart! 3 common treatments Spanish Flu U.S.:

1. Enema
2. Bloodletting
3. Whiskey (yes, specifically whiskey)

We know plate tectonics another 30 years.

We know structure DNA another 40 years.

We need appreciate far come short period time. thing happened Circle K yesterday, walking pay credit card dont trust pumps card readers part town. guy motor cycle yelled across parking lot telling take mask off. 

I went grocery store noon every one awkward pretty much 50/50 mix now. Scares me, I'm 9 months pregnant. I'll keep wearing mask. That's thing... new virus, know happen future.

For example, outbreak Encephalitis lethargica early 20th century probably thought worsened influenza pandemic 1918. movie book *Awakenings* patients. 

Covid-19 survivors may prone getting catastrophic diseases... know. Health insurance companies definitely counting Covid-19 infection pre-existing condition. It’s pretty scary. measles outbreak live last year daughter wasn’t old enough second vaccine it. pretty much stayed home last winter also it’s contagious stays air hours.  signed death sentence idiotic followers innocent citizens around them. may also hiding terminal case stupidity.  exactly I've never wanted thank someone part telling piss much time, haha.  


I get it, sucks, everyone scarified, others. guess get would part people around long, say fuck tell people stay home ""if scared"". think scared COVID, need mindful actions lead to. 

 one immuno-compromised people speaking of, taking precautions. still much myself, even vaccine, mean get sick. Although I'm also hopeful time next year many vaccines available (and even better ones then) also medications lessen severity illness catch it.  


We may see eye-to-eye, hope &amp; keep safe there. dollar every time heard Also distinctly rise. Yet, states lifted restrictions, restaurants bars open full capacity. ppl returing office WFH effective.. this! sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome/fibro fatigue.. feel peopke, living nightmare agony.


there big outbreak several decades ago like this, ny?? try look up.... need earthquake finish job Monitor temperature pulse ox can. don’t pulse ox drugstores carry them. 

Unless primary symptom covid like fever, cough, shortness breath, loss smell/taste, may want skip testing. done this? possible sue state handling COVID response? livid government making political thing listening advice scientists doctors. idk people determined push narrative Lockdown essential get vaccine. 

There's much information radical person look shows Lockdowns terrible. think shortest vaccine development time 7-8 years never ever able find one sort Coronavirus past. 

Sooner people realise going start look strategies involve vaccines better. Places winter things like COVID. translate well, guess. Good restaurant owners creative.  Yeah, check post histories, lots people arguing teh do0MeRz spreading denialist propaganda post lockdownskeptics nonewnormal. understand bigger conversation. fucking mental health entire populations one seems particularly concerned discussing it. Please treasure hunting toilet paper stalking delivery trucks paper towels. hate living here. Luckily PBC still allows %50 capacity. Can't second wave still first. 1M end year. \*all\* people care about, pretty common hit bars work anywhere. apparently one works Florida, moreso there- leave? Florida: go die. Oh god no, I'm vaccines (get flu shot every year like good boy). really something coming fast point. I'd personally feel better seeing data roll starts getting distributed would really go it. Also mom (and myself) immuno-compromised (auto-immune diseases fun, let tell ya) also need bit careful stick bodies all. It’s like Twilight Zone episode. Geeze didn’t expect downvoted like this. know lots people enjoy social distancing. stay away people can’t make stay away me. NY feel proud knowing governor who's smart effective. balances current President situation. Imagine living state governor President dumb asses..no wonder they're bumrushing bars.  put value going bars, concerts, festivals, sports games human life

Anyone friend family? Absolutely 100% questions asked. Especially since mortality rate WELL 1% said done dead elderly anyways.

Any questions? I’ve seasonal colds worse covid still enjoying face diaper?  C's stand Coronavirus, Cholesterol, Congestive heart failure. Lmao...its what's over/under #(Lockdown-related deaths) / (#COVID-19 deaths)?

I'm going 5. people keep putting words mouth say. 

So anyway US impacted strongly covid top 2 countries obese people now? theory?

So going further, saying fit ones pay social lives neglected diet decades ? software engineer, I'm social distancing Warning 300 million Americans almost lost cause. admire relentless passion though definitely seems bleak, looking article early Sep makes sound like variant less infectious? I'll wait people smarter make full analyses though:  Meh, I'm California test positivity rate twice NY. I'm getting BART Bay Area week. I'm expecting another lockdown winter I'm trying get things done happens. Misinformation campaigns countries Bunch idiots there? should, even county level site kinda does, nah, lets make political issue instead. /s It’s easy ignore something primarily happening developing countries. Read CDC % chance death. less 1%.

and far less that. 

you must retarded flu. coronavirus influenza virus related. well, that's one good way reduce number republican voters FL.. time election. suffer MS, Vitamin deficiency compromised immune system STILL chose throw baby mix? change life why? realizing effective vaccine several years.

This unequivocally false. already effective vaccines *right now*. simply reasonable expect people indefinitely.

Why not? I’m saying childish. pandemic punishment. It’s is. Let’s say nothing stop it, new pandemic begins immediately lasts rest time. idea shouldn’t what’s best it’s fair childish. 

Is fair get older health fails? No. take care tragedy all? 

Is fair civilization one pandemics inevitable we’re victims one? No. take care tragedy all? entire world this?  Liberals behind all, duh. Either 5G. checked credentials, seems team pretty solid know Stop getting worldview Facebook.

Wearing mask isn’t giving freedoms. Dude, know corona big deal now, numbers way inflated. shut stuff nonsense. Wear masks want get back it. Screw new normal. would wear those?? It’s flu bro /s it’s bad enough hospitalize I’ll fine I'd hate doctor Florida. things get worse make sense. Party on, Garth. 
Party on, Rona.  also sounds like autoimmune disease **Sep. 28, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

I feel y'all. work way? say injecting anything body don’t want? make crazy anti vaXX Stop fear mongered globalist news sources giving freedoms. covid19 cured cancers, diabetes, heart diesease, comorbidities. Considering get hit car covid system considered covid death, I'm suprised. Maybe claiming covid related deaths wasnt incentivised treated different common flu, be. thats point I'd imagine kind happen asleep 🤷‍♂️🥳 Hello guys! would day 2 vaccine trial. wanted check in. 

As required, supposed make diary entries MRNA vaccine trial app did. Yesterday got vaccine felt fine aside little dizziness caused administration vaccine. Today felt following:

- Fatigue
- Mild headache
- Sore throat

That's now. symptoms mild fatigue drag. better experience symptoms feel real thing well flu season restrictions lifted Orlando, FL, people running around mask, social distancing guidelines bars open full capacity per Ron Desantis's lifting restrictions days ago.

COVID KILLS PEOPLE. WEDDINGS BRING PEOPLE CLOSE CONTACT UN-NECESSARILY. PEOPLE DIE RESULT.

When something *knowing* kill people, *you go jail*. China cancelling new years quarantining city

God, feels like long ago. remember reading time built whole hospital COVID-19 (before even called that) ten days. 

I'm tired... live Tallahassee pass capital way work everyday, guy wears oversized cowboy hat waves giant Trump flag old capital grounds, don’t think wants DeSantis president That’s exactly thinking hoping lol Wont expect better Florida EXPLAIN Sweden's strategy along term strategy. 
 
Jesus fucking christ. already did. 
 Explain parts isn't. 
 
All parts different Taiwan. 
 one urbanized countries world 
 
Well, Sweden exceptional that, compared western northern countries. 
 almost 5% Stockholm's population located Northern Italy ground zero outbreak Europe 
 
Stupidity, done taiwanese. 
 old average population 
 
Not compared western countries. 
 last year lowest year relative deaths compared population since records started 300 years ago 
 
What, Sweden negative Covid deaths? western countries don't? 
 failures shitty profit retirement homes 
 
That everywhere, including Latvia. 
 shitty liver make much weaker corona virus. 
 
What makes sure? Shitty confidence? 
 Sweden still woefully subpar. 
 Yep, never claimed Sweden success story all. 
 
Well, pretty much buries Swedish strategy, it? 
 pretty clear actual knowledge handled, factors strategies are. 
 
I good enough knowledge. get vaccine, family safe people near wear mask? Yeah agree, depends country. numbers, 'colegui'. terms growth pattern, behavioral mechanics population, outbreaks, attitude, lack compliance etc. almost like GOP intentionally trying cause massive outbreak justify shutting election day... LMFAO gotta fucking kidding me. Ridiculous shit like fuel conspiracy theorists. covid March told stay home via telemedicine. Treated covid pneumonia told stay home, get chest x-ray. able breathe enough talk need go ER 
USA Colorado Umm. flu changes every years.  makes think im lock guy? US 1000 healthcare workers died Thanks! True guess screw occurred 2.5 months lockdowns.

But I’ve always said vast swathes US lockdowns one done thing. wasted chance effective one earlier 🤷‍♂️ Yeah probably really considering scientists saying prepare etc none happened. pandemic comes still listen. Absolutely shameful Lol way people going wear mask ""between sips"". strawman?  Downvoted speaking facts.It like way sometimes. 2,000 COVID-19 cases day?????? People dumb right now. 

Healthcare workers slaves. wrong America? live false pretenses people always going there. not. I'm sorry, think could doing. Seriously, guys putting fires. I'm sorry people stupid. Nurses doctors staff anyone step hospital...thank you. I'm sorry country stupid citizens you. I'm disgusted everyone right now. did. came spoke workplace, wife super pissed it! cool. “Says airline exec”

Yeahhhh I’m calling bullshit. doubt medical credentials. feel like fidgeting mask would even worse. Still doesnt even slow global population growth, far solution. day election gone. 

Jesus christ stick, virus killed least 200k people, caravan immigrants. causeth all, small great, rich poor, free bond, receive mark right hand, foreheads:
And man might buy sell, save mark, name beast, number name. existed I’d sign too. don’t think there’s still lockdown anywhere. I’m Cali can’t even tell. It’s stay home want type thing. I’m American GOP political party frustrating see measures taken, government anti mask excusing mismanagement testing great demand (whilst taking reasonable steps expand capacity). 

People seem pretty mellow general, bad thing government would job makes wonder like compared countries. Here's idea: get news TV. Yep doctor Fauci gives green light vaccine shot I’ll take Fox? None networks expressed skepticism? Soon friend, soon. Stay stay healthy regions also among high density population areas western europe called projection, GOP could open IMAX point. Iowa whopping 2% confirmed cases people get tested. Yet people bash Iowa like sort outbreak compared states laxed mask laws. like science turns blind eye stats back agenda. made fun wearing mask? Good god, can’t imagine here. People shoot daggers wearing mask. “the sniffles” guys, magically disappear 2 weeks cases rise, shortly that, deaths hospitalizations, would essentially give everywhere greenlight reopen fully, right?

It will, everyone else still need get vaccine. covid require 80-90% vaccination/infection herd immunity take full effect. break? break us taken actually outside, go dinners gyms unnecessarily crowded places. Glad people got Covid vacations continued spread disease stuck inside homes again. higher. 1% plane (study sponsored btw Aviation industry). magical appear sit plane. Boarding, Security checks included 1%. don’t think rabid anti-vaxx conspiracy theories believers think won’t listen won’t get one People worried whether government order employer close lose job.

Would people less worried could trust government provide adequate nets annoyed disruptions travel.

Even countries without lockdown allowing much travel, sports cut entirely.

Hence question whether people would less affected lockdowns lasted 2-3 months. Finland New Zealand reopened since party frowned upon even criminal areas.

Again, exclusive countries never managed outbreaks things due lockdown

All things lockdown instituted proper measures. countries require 2-3 months lockdown contain outbreak. Notably, US still seeing strict measures people refuse follow simple rules keep outbreak contained.

Hence question remains - would mental health less negatively affected countries largely socially responsible cohesive implemented minimal restrictions fine virus.

Sweden recommended people work home, populace following without issue.

Sweden also restricted group sizes 50.

This article talks elderLY hard hit. Lest forget, elderly Swedish care homes kept extended lockdown till Sep.

Also, mentioned already, Sweden travel restrictions EU countries - namely allowing travel within EU completely restricting non-EU residents entering.

Finally, Sweden looking second wave likely looking tighter restrictions. comparison, NZ actually less restrictions Sweden 3.5 last 5 months. Finland similar restrictions since May, except facing second wave.  anti-vaxx flat earth repitlian forums too, what's point? Western Europe probably living kind restrictions, probably soon. Without restrictions exponential growth virus means numbers become impossible hide, even ccp. think overestimate amount control have, large outbreaks happening China guarantee news would get out. Yet people point colder weather winter ask “lol climate change???” like 1% chance plane crashes % plane crashes way flight. statement study ""1% chance catch aircraft"" - excluding risk catch airport, Security checks, boarding, deplaning on. Ich

Sorry english  hasn't, except fans ... still think true, think 9k people died it. Even believe CDC, since millions, tiny percentage total population therefore NBD. got virus Sept 29th last year. Almost 1 year ago. left permanently fucked inner ear. 

I got shingles decade ago, gave tinnitus. still tinnitus. 

Parents refused get chicken pox vaccine kid they're science denialists conspiracy theories. Thanks mom dad, permanent hearing damage now. vegan years taking supplements. relax assumptions. Nobody entered US Wuhan appears touched transmission chain January. December even November introductions around world, none took off. 15% transmitters responsible 80% transmissions, need lucky chain superspreaders introduction take. Need sales tax income tax. widely available KY. time went drive thru community hospital. Previous tests Kroger site also employer. could go urgent care sign number drive thru options. easy regularly tested without symptoms city. Lack access reflects lack state giving fuck. you? I’m Orange County it’s shitshow stupidity. drove past solid block “outdoor” eating one wearing masks one social distancing. We’re planning opening public schools October 19th. ancient guy told friend looked like idiot wearing mask pumping gas Costco. So, no, I’d say California isn’t right that’s still COVID. RIP Mormon grandmas grandpas. Lmao fucking funny pubs first closed dan murphys got swamped sorry hear. can’t imagine stress.  

Does mom specific interactions point caused infection? family members get mom? not, (not)? remember back May crossed river sister state go beloved local orchard strawberry picking. Thought maybe state’s restrictions time could spend time outdoors spread out. arrived packed. noped right there. much higher. headline misleading. 1% chance catch aircraft. want fly also Security check, boarding, deplaning included 1%. cannot doubt lockdowns worse disease. covid largely ignored we'd now, yes would particularly bad flu season died life expectancy. What's done name ""saving grandma"" killing millions people yet lived adult life. widely available KY. time went drive thru community hospital. Previous tests Kroger site also employer. could go urgent care sign number drive thru options. much higher. headline misleading. 1% chance catch aircraft. want fly also Security check, boarding, deplaning, transport, walking gate included 1%. Yesterday NY , fucking party going un claimed business. mask, countless kids. facial coverings. people kept showing up, never karen. hate them. lockdown called 911. Turns , emergency, call 311. Even then, reluctantly took report.
I told understanding young lady. hate guy, cases spread , may cluster. Yeah understanding. take every single precaution make sure family safe. fuck wholes openly party. fucking pissed. adults decided party. kids openly exposed. Even correct:

If 200 people plane, would mean 2 new infections happen every flight.

Better hope connecting flight. Letting virus go population letting people develop immunity make sense simple numerical perspective. would prefer tourists came back. much economy tourism based Florida already gone Sick people don’t matter dead people do? Um, okay? due one single biosecurity breach got aforementioned towers aged care homes started spread like wildfire. 

Had rest country managed accidentally eliminate it, wouldn’t continued hard suppression.... near single figure cases still locked - it’s obvious want try eliminate community transmissions join rest country near covid normal... I've also living covid free life western Europe. live one worst countries Europe per capita cases right yet still know anyone caught covid among family, friends, work colleagues.

Your individual anecdote meaningless. fact anecode highlights concealable relatively low prevalence like Europe would be, governments inclined. Deaths stayed flat Spain, neighboring country France, they're seeing similar amounts cases. would surprising France's deaths follow Spanish trend. 7 day moving average daily deaths: 60. Complete hysteria. death rate death rate. size population. spanish flu roughly 6,800 US, 28,000 globally.

covid 600+ US, 128 globally time post. get tested local testing center? tests become available get work clinic?

Some days local testing center packed 50+ cars, days empty. time, read information posted February
You understand this.

I've met many people reddit communicate all.
The reason came reddit first place COVID-19, average person many Western countries simply get information China (your news lags us 2 months)
I'd really like able tell common human precautions.
But seems least Westerners need knowledge.
You're worth time.
This boring. near 1930's government rise coming white House. lot places aren’t locking cases rising, lot people feel need personally lock take care themselves/family. there’s really national standard creates lot confusion across land. fact, least live it’s seen negative thing it’s viewed political statement. attacks people wearing masks. Also millions people lost jobs/income we’re brink major housing crisis. It’s crazy. Top 10 things want hear upon deboarding 6 hour flight: ""Sorry sir dog barked go back home."" go T25 say professors community college much engaged teaching material. literally professor say understand doesn’t tenure bragged Google Scholar references. Top 10 things want hear upon deboarding 6 hour flight: ""Sorry sir dog barked go back home."" US. lost 675,000 spanish flu ~ 6,800 per million dead.

we've lost 600 per million covid.

worldwide spanish flu 28,000 per million.

COVID currently around 128 per million globally.

the spanish flu rough America, outright devastating elsewhere. nations lost several % population weeks. even worst case predictions predicted ~ half death rate spanish flu globally covid. unique spreading scenario came WW1 allowed aggressive flu mutation flourish. disgusting. overwhelmed.it never happen again. 

The rest city confined Worthing 5 kms homes. 

Where live btw?  want tests negative. means running enough catching cases. People get tested traveling potential exposure going back school work, based symptoms. mate talking good it, state fine stuff.

Turns New Jersey. Americans often live bubble, numbers 500 day state, US numbers good dreadful Australian perspective. economy, society general, collapse pretty hard what's ""super important"" next year so. Yup.... got control... 

The low, conservative, safe number MUST correct one.... “best” case news right still pretty horrifying.

It’s also sad know believe politically anti science Suit yourself, since stuck situation believe anything anyone says, there's value discussing it.
Have heard Russian novelist Chekhov's short story ""The Man Case ""?
I suggest check out. People wouldn’t get plane 1% chance would crash, would they? Yes, statistic indicates enough tests run. Correct. guess think risk greater going work 3 days week open space office masks worn (because apparently ventilation good enough), chose bar people well behaved, well ventilated (as case me).

You know risk cumulative, right? Copy paste link archive.vn

[http://archive.vn/y7l1F](http://archive.vn/y7l1F) already knoe seasonal actual experts claiming might anymore.

Seasons affect people's behavior though. Local residents mad bars restaurants opened started mass outbreak, people trying stop Kind really. Northern Ireland least purpose Great Britain.

Point Roberts town exists primarily purpose Canada. exists glorified duty-free (altoguth duty-free, cheaper) Canadians. convenient place US PO Box, buy cheap, shitty American milk chicken, cheap tank gas. way though. fully open without economic damage long government accurately communicates public limited risk posed coronavirus people.

My country opened travel, restaurants, bars cinemas month ago. Cases went modestly, increase due onset Fall start school, deaths increase.

Now we're holding steady hundred new cases day, daily deaths single digits, sometimes 0. Meanwhile economy open again, travel country resumed. country follow model, key accurately communicating relatively low level risk public, letting decide much risk they're comfortable with. Read article. He's deportee australia. hobbies better bars, unless mean ""hobbies *alone*"" **entirely** misses point. I’m sorry happened you. thank following rules. people refuse wear mask keep going socializing like isn’t big deal reason gotten worse (in US least) LOL new case rate per 100000 looks like decreased last couple weeks. 

Florida big tourist economy, autumn spring

I think lot people depend tourism way get back sense normal America massive shelter place, month. article says 1 death heading, body says 'no death'.  [no, non respiratory infection. ex military younger guy tell evening it’s okay paid $750 taxes employees taxes houses contribution working businesses. two guys quickly stopped conversation.... ever living fuck.  evidence various countries Europe seems be: allow something, people it. mean think achieved immunity? month that? think whole.. I'm living street, bicycle ride, yay trump because... white people rule! answer keep schools open hope best? Continue this: *suno gaurse duniya walon* Free healthcare quick? Complete anarchy. basically every year ever flu season? People aren’t gonna put lives hold forever small percentage immunocompromised people won’t happen really necessary? this! social distance wear mask now, life literally gone shit since pandemic started. took precautions willingly first, hear people wanting prolong mask wearing restrictions, feel like need speak know ton people starting feel way. Without getting political, I'll say I've life long Democrat, try legislate may well start consider voting Republican. feel strongly it.   Gen Z screwed anyways cares. Speaking fear mongering...  Still, taking approved vaccine might finally turn tide fucking virus based something might hypothetically happen sounds like bad bet. I'll taking vaccine available, trust scientists say safe. hope side effects come it. approved vaccine make huge deal morale basically means solution, thing need end pandemic, take time rollout.

Compare to, knowing long people stuck miserable hell, day getting harder harder people nothing uncertainty. countries, pay tax people receive government help. 

Your country paid 100s billions dollars big companies instead.  50% people obey law, time rethink law, double down. next doubling going be? there's less 1% chance airline companies going bankrupt, says medical doctor. need travel plane, everything gonna fine fun part is: filled ICU, packed hospital, surgeries = layoffs! Good know people don’t even wear mask lmao Antibody test negative?

My dad sick disease starting 12th September. stuck home really wear mask. isolated room, went spoke normally 5 days got results. 2 days diagnosis, everybody else house (3 us) got tested negative. now, antibodies either.

Are tests unreliable weird ass luck? Nope Newer research suggests VAST majority recover fully terms shortness breath lung issues.

Doesn't fit narrative though Whoa, scrolled post history sister husband going Florida visit family thanksgiving way described wife’s family reminded mine. 

My sister brother law live right outside Dallas (used live Deep Ellum though) Europe, too! coincidence lol. He’s Romanian though You‘re serious this?
That‘s damn scary me.

Could describe don‘t like it?
Are things enjoy less eat drink?

Don‘t carve sweets, chips, alcohol softdrinks time time?
Is difference well prepared meal chef, mother someone vs. fast food microwave food. Presumably OP child story. New South, New Zealand Queensland never got 7000 active cases sub 300 cases before.

Victoria uncharted territory. would nice fast forward button would allow us FF months see plays out... can't wait year end.  you’re going suffer wearing mask 8 hours may well right. get used it.  people idiots. nearly able return normal like rest country. almost zero cases - yes possible English great stress it. Hospitalizations says all. theory two ways positive test rate would rise. 1. Big reduction people willing go get tested
2. Genuine tick cases. 

Number 2 is. get point masks, though I'm convinced thats major issue. 

Not enhough tests, demanding measures asking public (and later complain people dont listen), narrative youngster/students wont get sick (which might true most, though youngster live parents) items dont get. Including measures finding source contamination, possible enough people job? mean... take personal responsibility. mean views going hardly changed. He's still going think coronavirus bullshit. tourists parts Indonesia. Australians allowed travel overseas. Rein-area 100km Dutch border. crowded, major issues there. maybe specifically, apologies assuming, generally vibe sub need loss liberty, aka authoritarianism. teach dogs, teach neural networks. ""human sized microwaves"" good thing get OTA television free! Man, administration really top providing great best health standard people. Who’s masked up? it’s socially demanded people isn’t, 100% aren’t. Thats shame. me, european, easy grasp drive reasonable time taking plane imo atm still risky idea.

1 100 Catch plane + x% catch way airport, boarding, Security check (all included 1%)

I Imagine feels long away gf. longest around 2 weeks short anti Terror Guard military Operation also 2 weeks holidays...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ask authoritarianism? Two things. 1,we better treating 6 months experience. death rates hopefully never return April numbers.
2, know now. Death lags behind positive cases. bet house deaths increasing numbers. great content upcoming documentary. people responsible too. over, hope there's mass, PEACEFUL protest outside Fox News. read happens find case. way get back zero massive contact tracing huge amounts testing. Without things nature virus means quickly control. can't contract tracing China keep quiet, 2 go together. city live cases back details released, everything could traced. 100 cases can't become zero without it, 100 cases city would massive news Chinese social media. Yes, maybe would try cover up, believe would able to.  Currently Covid-19 kills order 200,000 people per year US, many already bad shape. much worse WWII, WWI Vietnam Korean war measured deaths per/year. 

But unless look inside overcrowding hospitals, barely notice it. Roughly 2.8 million people die US every year. people die reason one one, increasing death rate barely noticeable. chronic diseases. 

Most people ridicule mask use say right over. weird demographics serious, hospitalised cases corona virus people suffering long Covid 19 aligned. serious cases coronavirus tend elderly, working class, minority ethnic males pre existing co morbidites. majority long covid 19 victims middle class, usually women age 20 40 never hospitalised.

Curious, curious... Corona Australia comes concentrate watered down, carbonated bottled CUB memory. would want drink it?

I'd interested trying overseas brewed yeah nah postmix beer. I'm doubting story ASTONOMICALLY unlikely someone would two friends age 40, zero health issues die COVID. 

The death rate 40s less 1 1000 includes people cancer, heart disease etc.

You genuine 1 million person two healthy under-40 friends died COVID Lol good luck Even germany basically gave up.

Sure, laws need mask. many people ignore law zero consequences, people follow suit.

We traffic light system cities, several cities red look down, are...

People tired manx strict rules, keep ignoring them.

Sooner later, every state look like America, question is: vaccine available shit hits fan?

I seriously doubt it. great Thanks! know get downvoted fell trap, there’s reason live much fear it. really don’t matter hard try there's always weak link reservoir virus lurking somewhere.

That's works. kind lying local party officials (e.g. reporting harvests, economic output) please superiors always feature CCP.

Oh know expert China. long live speak read Mandarin? giant weddings events since reopened. fl though still weekly 300+ ppl zero masks worn attendees, country club people 64+ really nutty. someone healthcare, dunno, everyone know seems fine. Maybe it’s burnout immersed months everyone going beach summer going hiking stuff days off. feel like friends healthcare worse regards responded mentally Foreign economists forecast growth. Gross domestic product expand 1.5% second quarter year earlier, according median estimate economists Bloomberg survey last week. That’s faster 1.2% growth seen last survey May. Economists also dialed full-year growth projection 1.8% Nobody else seems looking like me, big problem leads severe cases air pollution (especially NO2). 
I fear next weeks catastrophic Manaus.

Look NO2 levels since Sept 7: horrific - really bad week still ideal.  
That air pollution situation lead, 2-4 week delay, massive rise severe cases Covid-19 deaths. 
Those infected get bad - mainly due NO2.

Spend minute look Guayaquil Ecuador. Exactly pattern earlier year. 
Then look many badly hit locations around world - almost bad NO2 levels really bad hospitals got overloaded. 
Lockdown led lower NO2 led fall severe cases. 


Best avoid getting Covid-19 (wear mask, socially distance, keep air-conditioned locations &amp; restaurants). 
If get exposed it, low Vitamin levels exposed NO2 going massively increase odds bad outcome. Positive? That's good news!

Positive good, no?! Gluttony, sloth, pride. Nice fatty combo. Yeah bounce back. People confident basically eradicated virus within borders. stop OG’s?! post history hilarious - interesting “mind” have... Well every disease long-term effect. live disease. sorry english. understand higher rate. 

While recent increase testing might explain increase cases, hospitalizations also surged Midwest influenced number tests performed.

North Dakota’s positive test rate averaged 30% past seven days compared 6% prior week. positivity rate risen 26% South Dakota, 17% previous week, according analysis using testing data COVID Tracking Project.

Minnesota Montana averaging 7% tests coming back positive, Montana’s positivity rate rose Sunday 20%, according analysis.

These dipshits making pandemic last longer should. Could've learnt lessons Asian countries control community spread, allowing freedom movement faster return back normal life.

But NOOOOOO, argue masks, argue lockdowns, argue everything sun, ie fucking rest countries taking seriously. many questions. actual numbers sensitivity false positives? published anywhere. proper controls? identify specific sars-cov2 coronavirus positive? Anyone got link depth analysis method? Except it'll remembered maybe killing someone several people instead.

I went wedding week ago supposed 50-60 people outdoors. 100 dinner large ""outdoor tent"". Basically sealed 2 entryways it. Fairly spaced still good amount people per table, everyone dancing singing etf etc. Apart dinner 30-45 min spent rest night outside.

Vendors masks etc man nervous. laid super low following week go anywhere, got tested Friday came back negative thankfully. heard someone may wedding knows.

The World Health Organization considers rates 5% concerning suggests cases community yet uncovered.

Several states New York, Massachusetts, Vermont Maine positive test rates less 1%.

At time positive test rates climbing Midwest, cases hospitalizations setting records states.


In past week, seven states Midwest western region reported record one-day rises new infections - Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin Wyoming.

Wisconsin set records new cases twice last week reporting new infections day Florida. South Dakota set records new cases three times last week.

While recent increase testing might explain increase cases, hospitalizations also surged Midwest influenced number tests performed.

R.I.P. cruise industry. Things get better time. know it’s hard see, hope. =) #maskitorcasket4life think it’s combination many factors. u r sick stay @ home. u aren’t go freely. 
Complicating things : u 60 probability real trouble low. 
But could transmit elderly people pre conditions. That’s social distancing. 
Also u r asymptomatic even Fauci agree u r driver pandemic 

Available evidence contact tracing reported countries suggests asymptomatically infected individuals much less likely transmit virus develop symptoms.

So don’t panic , u feel sick stay home dont see logic. Follow guidelines lockdown scenario end sooner.. Go gathering 1,000 people masks extend lockdown.. DUMBASSES I’m actually shocked people still taking cruises... remember reading summer movie moving production Canada CA COVID-19 control. reading this, I'm betting movies filmed outside US usual. number win95 Better wedding remembered masking &amp; trying prevent outbreak remembered wedding killed several people...

I would've hoped wedding Maine infected almost 200 people killed 8 (none attended wedding) would least object lesson others... also save life event severe anxiety attack. Yeah, think really botched response coronavirus. quarantined isolated, we'd ended similar trajectory countries treated like ""no peeing"" section pool. live Charlotte, people drive South Carolina stuff time since they're opened are. Yeah, interesting virus magically acquired furine cleavage site it? Totally natural. 

Have read virus heart? Basically cuts sarcomeres little parts, never seen virus. infect stem cells, immune cells, basically anything everything. 

Say wanna say China least cares people. Even let lab, they're aware enough save people. governments, otoh, guilty literal genocide. Long term damage survivors?

Let's add pre existing conditions. Doctor Gottlieb former head FDA nothing pinball company started 1927... true. It’s pandemic much lack response way ravaged country due politics taking over. matter right, it’s seeming nothing since people around go please boost economy.
So yeah handle staying keep people safe seeing lack leaders helping guiding knowing live armpit supposed “great” country depressing part. Improvements treatment reduced rate deaths increased average time till death make it. 2 weeks accurate early pandemic knew less. costly slow mechanism.

This isn’t easy anyone clearly much harder yet seems forgotten much commentary. Yeah, south utah barely anyone wears masks tons people vacationing right now. Good times. Sorry guy's never tried begin with, even close. I've stuck hardcore lockdown Melbourne Australia 4 months, mask mandate risk serious fine, can't travel 5km home (3.1 miles), maximum 6 people funeral, curfew 9pm lifted numbers coming down, people swallowing reality.

That set everything failure. Even excuse dumb. Oh there's shortage? Let's lie 330 million people tell wear masks. 

Other countries mask shortages too. know instead? told people make clothe masks. lie massive scale. venue: ""No masks allowed. want wedding remembered COVID"".

NZ's GDP 2 quarters still -2.5% forecast Okay well, that’s bit bc dramatic. stay home. Well probably is. want Attorney General enforcing unconstitutional laws? never claimed mandates! 


Most places U.S. mandates either. recommendations.


The problem snowflakes terrified change protested recommendations acted like recommendations slavery taking rights.


Many even complained masks truly needed, someone would force laws mandates.



Oh irony. know got COVID.

How many ways times could possibly qualified comments hypothetical?

FFS clear, again, MAY EVER KNOW GOT INFECTED, BUT** IF** asshole refusing wear mask, would case someone’s selfish behavior killing someone. 

Just case you’re still getting point here, people refusing wear masks like see videos aren’t guilty bad behavior, actions real risks death associated them. someone who, according video (do need clarify it’s 100% certainty?) took precautions. wouldn’t surprising death result someone else taking precautions protect others (again, I’m saying it’s certainty, way knowing). Yet redditors large cheer Yes. education problem stop GOP, got plenty democrats anti-vaxxers. Ok, think Democrats add PR DC states, maybe others. all, sure people ok 40 million people getting 2 senators another 40 million people get 62 senators would totally ok senate radically swung opposite direction new states added. got problem inherent arbitrariness states getting 2 senators, blame me. pandemic really showed us much care humans. hate ""it's much worse flu people."" We'll flu really sucks like seeing anyone get sick. us best spread cold. 

People dicks. know that. pretty much recent surges we've seen, taken right around 4 weeks situation peak. 4 weeks election. They're playing dangerous game timing. extended family Neberaska, it, every single one them. soon school started. even remember telling cousin (who clueless single mom, comes what's going world) soon school starts COVID19 explode.

I right. ""No can't choose abort fetus!""

""	Hell wear mask, body, choice!""  everyone risk? welcome! Glad helped out. (I think saw reference us Twitter.) Wish bit traction there... lots folks writing CDC changes, source ours... none mentioning us, alas! :( Sweden. 

Their high number deaths per million due awful health policies regarding nursing homes count those, pandemic response really effective sustainable.  almost like state income tax, poorer people pay anyway, giant giveaway wealthy robs states needed social programs fiscal stability... Yeah, but, really matter spread. disease, pandemic. somebody's waiting room, sure god guess you’re gonna get back dyin According ticket software, WFH statiscally effective pre-covid, boss wanted people office. ticket software keeps reporting record lows completion. Huh. Trump administration tried wishing away they're fresh ideas. understand OP's point? basically exactly they're saying problem. major point OP's point clearly false. Lockdowns lifted many states people crowding bars restaurants. See: Florida. take anti-vaxxer then. say, ""just anti vaccine"" remember 90% people call anti-vaxxers one vaccine themselves. !remindme 3 weeks ""The COVID Control Group""  Jokes you. It'll floods climate change then. Double check gaskets, lol.  barely call flu shot shot. mildly uncomfortable. Sure. lot gets muddled economics too, though. There's huge difference two people state lockdown lack thereof one way buy groceries, trying figure overcome boeredom social distancing either secure savings, cashed million dollar PPP check.

It's difficult figure one going greater mental health impact.

It's crazy look trillions dollars incredibly poorly spent... millions people literally cannot feed themselves. Agreed principle, practice, distribution logistics still won’t easy probably won’t get *much* faster. Distribution isn’t trivial, supplies administer vaccine aren’t trivial scaled, there’s many people army nurses/doctors/pharmacists inject given day. wasn’t Walmart employees stock shelves. lack compassion underwhelms me. can’t imagine dealt shit others experienced. Calling others mentally weak sign bully someone never empathy. Disgusting. problem little cable news stations fox others news. mostly editorial. tell think instead presenting where. focus total grey area. want good news subscribe Reuters AP. I've never believed this. get welfare. They've recommended U.S. months.


A major portion U.S. terrified change, terrified masks, panicked freaked recommendation wear mask.


Refusing follow easy simple proven recommendations leads mandates, laws, fines, jail time. Canada seems like reasonable option people start using brains!

I’m truck driver Canada happens Wisconsin right now, Mauston precise. see absolutely mind boggling. It’s like totally different planet, Covid doesn’t even exist here. Seriously, blows mind. 

I’m trying hard stay far away everyone can, fact I’m trying best leave cab unless absolutely necessary. first thing I’m gonna get back home go get tested. 

I love guys usually happy bring whatever Canadian goods desire, last months seriously changed view place. guys smart much proud of, let vocal idiots destroy beautiful country? Number cases meaningless. Ventilated patients ICU meaningful metric. ICU hospital Chicago ZERO. avoiding question shows u don’t know facts . u try insinuate conservative nonsense. What’s point ? 

First u claim whole country locked prove u wrong suddenly point something else avoid answering nonsense. Strange sub lots different voices sort weird summary. Lock down’s comin’ , go again! one day obituary page middle nowhere 2 pages long normally 2 3 people. course nobody knows explains people died sure seems suspicious. one speak mouth breather gets huffy gets management involved Also 2% annualized barely inflation. San Antonio here. one wears mask work except me, mask mandate still on. simply state, avoid Milwaukee, that's place pushing wisconsin's numbers useless. look American politics you’ll get it: gerrymandering forcing rhetoric everyone living city area made urban/metro area people one way rural/country people other.

I work suburbs (kinda, pandemic. work home) l live Milwaukee difference alone creates crazy.

I work people Milwaukee country result. There’s one lady makes 2 hour commute freaking suburban area job that, time governors election, made big deal “god help country tonight” voted next governor booted sack shit Scott Walker.

Country people taught fear city anyone that’s straight white Christian threat American way wants take everyone away them.

It’s obviously false, try telling people think us cities coming house middle woods stockpile million five guns. Sad story. Good Army speaking experimenting new stand-up days: Army Sgt. Maj. Michael Grinston said units begun “stand-up” days, commanders focus bringing people together, making sure connect families ensuring strong values treat other. People sue get ill bars/restaurants bar:restaurant negligent. No, full scale vaccination. 3d phase study right now. Russians voluteirs young healthy enough (there list contraindications). would available everyone earlier next spring. sub: Nobody go buy things lockdown

Also sub: smh florida locking everyone going out. end world.  Thank you! Praying family What's recall Evers thing? saw bunch insane looking people today big signs trying get people sign petion. was.... shocking.... riddiculous seemed. Someone died small condo complex parents thinking buying into. One lady brought back, dinner sister family, brother law caught died, along random man condo. best figure, used elevator caught covid. wearing mask even take trash bad idea. means cases. 
  
5000 cases 3% positivity rate gives good confidence 5000 good estimate number cases.
  
5000 cases 25% positivity rate means real number cases much higher since people likely tested. 
  
High positivity rate means sickest people tested, usually accompanied long delays. makes contract tracing useless leads R values 1. Literally nobody know wants door opened. Swallow racism. jog memory, specific comment concern using term “There’s limit much life I’m willing give up” regards distancing wearing mask, things could literally kill others like me. said original comment, seems like poor choice words. whole point Senate give *state* equal representation federal government. based population, based fact eyes constitution, every state equal equal rights responsibilities regardless many people live there. 

The House population factored in. you’re salty unfair population representation, campaign House add representatives, don’t try change Senate something never designed be. agree, want FDA skipping steps POTUS said virus would magically disappear, hoax virus look good election. Pure garbage leader got Truthiness conservatives crave! Why? WHY? fuck FL stupid. Goddamn... love freedom like next American, Jesus H. Christ brain Florida! gets test already suspect they're positive (i.e. symptoms)? waste test actually need one otherwise. Vaccines stimulate generation antibodies mutant strains (there several) resistant antibodies generated original strain D614G. That's something easily test. sucks Alright, really want details: error-prone, orthomyxovirus RNA polymerase coronavirus RNA polymerase?

Coronavirus family members much genetically stable orthomyxovirus family members, including influenza. Yes, fall behind who?


I get mean fall behind school. messed year isnt going fix disparities schools.

Teachers going figure way get kids caught up, spent year mish mash different options.



In area we've middle school high schools go 2 days school, 3 home, 5 days school, back fully home kids tested positive.


Elementary went 2 days school 3 days school, 5 days school. teachers going two week quarrantines they've come contact people may it. kids get substitutes.


And Fall Break couple weeks, even 1/4 school year yet.


Is definition ""Normal""?


Maybe generation learn panic every little change lives.



It's odd one groups fix failing schools decades promote Homeschooling. ramped rhetoric even last spring option. Homeschool cure public school ills. Public schools indoctrinating kids wrong political beliefs, anti christian, anti family values, etc...


Over summer millions people would dog public schools, promoting private schools homeschooling decades suddenly change heart. failing indoctrination centers reopen fully person, kids...

Back Normal! notice neighbor states. governor keeping force us helps. touch states is, unsurprisingly, highest areas. idea state different? I'd always thought bit laid back Scandinavian sort place. RDA 800 IU miscalculation. 8,000 excessive totalitarian powers? No, seriously, I'd love example. live California would like hear authoritarianism state. Build wall. America sending best Oh don’t get wrong, don’t think lockdown ever would good don’t think going open Florida response makes bit sense either. 

Furthermore, making sure underfund unemployment small business support crutch get people want openings horrible, absolutely horrible. would liked world reacted even decently clearly imo, be, case across country.

However, think ways approach things help better balance range impacts caused prudent restrictions reduce severity. 

So see talk depression impacts, isn’t run around bars least. impact, that’s unavoidable, far enough say it’s time leaders (the ones actually productive stuff) talking — educating rallying informing — covid point; study shows, there’s awful lot anyone handle matter source.

My chief fear end spot horrible covid outcome many others right next it. Leave IL it. We're them. We've saying last 5 months ridiculed, called grandma killers outright deplatformed.

Make sure ban German Minister Economic Development. lessons 2020 stick. last saw 30% people NYC estimated caught it, florida removed government pandemic orders Oh hypotheticals?

If virus never happened would zero.

If everyone wore mask social distanced would thousands.

If republicans moved florida would better country.

I like game. hate living Florida Indiana. one where’s masks attorney general said unconstitutional make citizens wear masks. time. mature. would spreading then, unless worse feature?

It's like US infection control all, given government's strategy give everyone see lives dies. actually work? I've aways thought NZ much better fascistic Australia It’s interesting different life experiences know, are. lockdowns so, restrictions, something comes almost time see friend though try avoid chat starts. 

The election / trump / political stuff sure COVID risk bit circles, interwoven one long discussion what’s right do, meant someone’s job, relationships life activities. 

Thankfully people connect finding pace insanity. However, usually means pushing away what’s safest covid. Pandemic fatigue sure. Nah, suck up.
There's nothing pathetic Beta lol. also, people risk covid grew era tremendous optimism financial growth. could property normal salary upwardly mobile. Stay one company forever. 

The world changed much young people ones screwed. milking people age younger. It’s enough. lives potentially going set back long time due mitigation. needs factored in. Kids need normal school, attend college feels like college prison, need government actually cares quality life young people. I’m really horrified little care. Short term sacrifice fine, attitude accept mitigation indefinitely based whims not. That’s opinion. Indiana reopened everything without restrictions two weeks cases roof I’m sure. capital city 🌃 restrictions right pandemic nightmare. personally afraid virus anymore, think achieved immunity. people becoming poor terrible. Also terrible fact disregard daily death number total normal thing. might go store mask cold months on, gonna lie. Yes husband antibody test April, came back positive mine came back negative yet sick, worse him. Since seeing antibodies diminishing 3 4 months can't prove one way other. Remember someone tries tell ""he die covid, died heart attack."" Sharks half billion years sharks survive oceans dry. Lots species might go extinct clade widespread wipe out. People start spending time inside. Family holidays. Less vitamin production (known immune booster lots correlation better results Covid infection). main things think may (I doctor) Brisbane we’re pretty well think. Life’s close normal lot ways quite months - shops, restaurants, schools etc open (albeit restrictions) - it’s really great! cases we’ve recent months hotel quarantine. one outbreak recently people came back Melbourne lied they’d avoid quarantine, don’t think went 30 active cases state one time. 

I can’t speak everywhere everyone, Brisbane I’ve found testing pretty easy access - you’re advised get tested respiratory symptoms all. got tested last Saturday I’ve got cold. called GP, got referral form emailed straight out, went drive testing centre 10 minutes away (there several others nearer closed time weekend), 10 minutes. Got negative result text less 8 hours later. Oh good. get see one kills them. you’re afraid virus 97 percent survival rate, stay inside sheltered world, don’t around anyone, don’t anyone come around you. 

Normal people get back work live normal lives. fuck off. understand point: everybody acted like perfect little pawns game pandemic chess, would pandemic. Well, people people, that’s fact live Hospitals overwhelmed. Average age death still +80. H1N1 small potatoes compared live Midwestern college town. past weekend football game 17,000 people attendance unofficial motorcycle rally (the official event cancelled asshole bikers came anyway). today picking groceries saw 1 every 10 people walking around large groups masks. masks made mandatory polling precincts governor. yeah, COVID getting worse worse weather definitely getting cooler cooler week. China #4 inbound tourism. don’t need lockdowns strong public health measures.  definitely seeing herd effects though. ~25% population immune contracting COVID-19, caused new cases start go without meaningful change measures taken. full herd immunity yet, 1/3 way there. bit caring + walking around social media brain. important.  Midwest several states focus article. tell us ""don't worry, virus mutates slowly non-crucial sequences""?

It’s like old people life love. think need rational asked people long it’s tolerable.  hope people remember after...

Haha. doubt it. People tend bond much selfish creeps chose throw baby mix?


Holy shit shut fuck  It’s simpler that. Republicans killing country. democrats independents supposed haven’t doing? It’s Trump Republicans versus sanity. that's thought back april. 4-6 hours air 7-9 days non-porous surfaces. got extremely lucky much virus needs get body start showing symptoms feel like Florida last place I'd able relax country atm Lollll sounds Russian. German. liked film. really well done. Check directors Tangerine. ever get antibody test? fair, went European one average age (and thus experience partio) much higher US ones, issue awful.

Most people clear getting into, knowledge set wanted acquire. lot ways, microcosm US higher education system - attend either learn specific information relevant gicen field, go broader foundational tools indirectly relevant short term sense.

I speak experience, feel many article's points applied fairly, e.g. cases - always clear context free considered isolation, quite good way. really lack broader contextual thinking specific topics like finance bothered me, lack tie-in topics like strategy, ethics, macroeconomics, etc.

And frequently spark discussion, even ripping smug little McKinsey shithead.

I gotta say, overall interesting, would recommend high percentage people might otherwise consider it. Again, can't speak US programs, mine. speak us beaches open sun shining. expected. Nothing surprising this. knew months. virus death rate least 1/1000 let loose completely susceptible population 7.5 BILLION people. Celebrating Elbo Room Fort Americans able voluntarily Chinese did. virus would eradicated assumed Americans would right thing; estimates way low.

Their current estimate 370,000 deaths Jan, 2021 (they estimate 270,000 deaths masks universally used).  sweetly manipulative thing them. Charming. [Here's graph 1918 flu Take look massive spike near middle. take look months.

It's gonna bad. Real bad. seem bad either. Yup. Masks help lessen need lockdown. It’s strange masks don’t want lockdown. reasoning behind opinion, money. want keep making money. essential workers expendable, elderly people high risk conditions. conservatism general philosophy - work die. And... get point.

This can't nice things. mean got ""herd"" part right, anyway. Browns game? bar? call living? It’s purgatory best. Absolute morons hurt know. didn’t want information it’s important know. Damn. I’m talking actual characters, cinematography. It’s beautifully shot film captures essence Florida’s look. make great points. said diff msg, feel bad kids growing crap right now, moreso many people know. guys losing time can’t get back, miss commute office. still think compassion people like grandmother isn’t bad thing. makes awful dangerous piece shit, gladly accept moniker. Well military suicides gone I’m sure non-military suicides gone too. Suicides overall definitely spiked this. people show regard human life science. Won’t sad get corona. Shiz gonna get crazy bad.

it though...we're damn near 100% survival rates anyone age 50... *laughs Chinese* mutate like flu, get vaccine every year may may effective whatever strain going around. We'll hear outbreaks time time become new normal. Dude, mine say? percentage international tourism? 700,000 cases. Stay classy Florida Disheartening stuff. really feel sad. nightmare. Florida Project very, unflattering look Florida We're still done first surge! think point around people. Got news you....millions people died last year nobody blinked fucking eye. power Tavern League doesn’t help, general sense. would go tourist, assuming let in? COVID risk obviously much lower US. Actually, pretty clear, don’t care people think. That’s make decisions. oxygen hope mean 5000 test 5000 tested positivity rates. agree you. 

There vast difference 5000 tested people 3 % positivity rate 5000 tested 30% positivity rate. 

5000 3% means 159 cases 5000 30%means 1500 cases heuristic, rule thumb common speak. people say learn Asian countries, one things learn. experience infectious diseases, correlating positivity test rate things going field, generally agreed 5-10% marks transition ""you're well"" ""you're screwed"". observation accepted guideline infectious disease. 50 getting it, deaths would thousands tens thousands.  want get virus. People focus death toll, casualty. still learning disease years till solid grasp science here.  would also like open mouth kiss neighbor honest... coming post CDC page!! 

Additionally, NYT report excess deaths worldwide opposed CDC limited US plenty data multiple sources call BS person's claim 

I'm linking NYT paywall. hospitalizations soaring.

they tho. So? black man US, I'd arming pretty heavy right now. worse people realize stupid are. think Googling basic information makes clever. need learn basic math! put 2 x 2 Google! lost ksu beginning pandemic providers overwhelmed critical patients presenting appeared respiratory failure treated accordingly ventilators. Unfortunately learned standard treatments ineffective cases left many manage survive permanent lung damage. look current trends, numbers excessive deaths falling providers learned effective methods treat virus. Even cases rising rapidly, death rates continue decrease. Would personally advise black people avoid COVID vaccine 2021 Walgreens tech might swap government-mandated brain control serum?

Or, people color would avoid mass-produced vaccine specific reason? Based country's overall response pandemic, large worthy condescension. important also note often numbers under-reported factor 2.5-10x good news pertaining COVID? Vaccines, treatment etc? Never see subreddit.  meant respect commentator stating young population probably wont large death rate countries. Even compare countries largest number young adults combine one worst health infrastructures, would think would put us worse position others. Coronaviruses rarely mutate meaningful degree. Although, greater number infections, likely significant mutation would occur. Although unlikely, significant mutation ability make vaccine much less effective. Yep, boat you. Sadly, proven crazy ones probably 2 months. 

I hope proven crazy ones be. 

JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) - Arkansas State head football coach Blake Anderson met media Monday weekly press conference.

Along breaking Coastal Carolina matchup, Anderson revealed tested positive COVID-19 earlier month.

**“I tested positive, ran fever 10 days. know that’s going take lot people surprise. didn’t announce like Mike Norvell did. time, lot things going on. knew weren’t going playing, knew wasn’t going miss game** actually got sick coming straight Kansas State game. got sick within couple days, started symptoms. Physically tested positive Wednesday (September 16th), sick within couple days. turned out, would able coach week (vs. UCA - originally scheduled September 19th). zero bearing us postponing game. honest you, strictly available bodies play safely. nothing testing positive.” really even remotely close. Elective procedures hospitals make substantial portion profits. mean, yeah don’t nearly much you. You’d think would better Waves waves Whew thank God. Victorian, I'd happy another state limelight. We're exhausted here. Yes, every single year including last 3 administration. ...but year transition power January. Way much risk view. kind trusted international oversight would. That’s disgusting. would put past them. give right act fool get everyone else sick. That's average yearly flu vaccine. combined post-infection immunity, possible latent cross-immunity, continuation basic social distancing mask wearing, enough stop meaningful spread. feel dumber reading Yeah buddy waterboard shits giggles decade shit fucking terrible. basically freaked instantly water started.

Would recommend. Well notice 'Irishman bar talking things he's accomplished' joke it?; call McGreggor bar builder?  call McGreggor wall builder?  call McGreggor pier builder? No.  ya fuck one goat...""

This group trust FDA. Unfortunately that's I'm going remember for. wanna move goal post France Qatar lot countries considerably worse shape US counted per 100K population. Sunday, Monday, wait two weeks, stat holiday slowed testing, blah fucking blah. Really? Can't put 2 2 together get conclusion medical advice exactly telling people live lives certain period get back track illness possibly prevent occuring? ones needed goddamn pandemic. 

Seriously? *Seriously?* can't believe people damn hollow skulled. Wtf Anyone Lyme disease scientific background relationship/knowledge CDC already trust CDC decades now. They've inept easily influenced outsiders/politics LONG time now. part response whole pandemic poor, course know real source influence pandemic political leadership it’s released Trump. Gotta wait till ""Corona Wave IV - New Vaccine "" comes ... Europe? thought better us Amerifats Actually, death rate U.S. slightly lower Australia: U.S. greater percentage population infected. Still, important measure **survivability.** many infected recover live see loved ones. load Yule Log Youtube every Christmas, tradition. No, cruithe sthip ith thtill floating, jutht COVID. one thunk.  *grimdarkness intensifies* New Hampshire surprisingly redneck conservative. I'm pretty sure logic used Nice, Black Diamond favorite bar world. actually lucrative live right place. 120-150 dollars hour good trainer area. Amazing 🤔 Inside dead since 30 years physical dead something dread - happienes expected solution mess living in. Thank you! wished done something meaningfull nevermind. little bit cold Place expected go death still ok. Andrew Yang's presidential campaign made feel hope human-centered governance. Look policies perhaps support movement think help! concern criminal enterprise anything like example. Please enlighten me. getting worse position standout worst developed world past cares, cruises use sails.

I'm worried need put /s really hope Smoke weed Turtle. get flu shot year? curious since people see say actually don’t “Slowly hitting specific regions different times” Almost like wave. Leave. whole family northern Florida us moved away saner states. whole state neo-feudalist shithole point. thing lockdown accomplished destruction small businesses monopolizing wealth hands few. done absolutely nothing, would far better now. US response done nothing strengthened oligarchic power, crushed average man. Again, virus nearly deadly deserving amount fear creates. Plagues happen, dangerous thing way influences political sphere. 

Guarantee election, “COVID crisis” shrink away quickly. Unless becomes useful tool bureaucratic powers crush middle class. Indeed - seems like basically reminding Americans 7 billion non-Americans health institutions.

As non-American, seems condescending Americans, I'm actively living experience guess can't say. matter end result actions leading somebody’s death? alright kill one person wrong kill two? human life even value people? mindset happens time time again. COVID, gun control, abortion rights, welfare programs. mean...they good little while...and NYC long time maintaining good numbers.

But said...humans humans matter time. Frankly surprised see greater numbers throughout summer Also Germany seems fairly well current times. would know. certain political figures less influence EMA FDA don’t come say think real difference is? u! have...the second got China spread unknowingly fucked. could slowed spread better masks distancing held vaccine. unleashed near impossible stop. That’s joke Remember (accurately) thalidomide, blocked FDA approval based review process even strict left plenty conspiracies. pointing goes ways. Actually, better chance surviving disease U.S. vs U.K. Almost 10% infected U.K. die, vs. 3% U.S.  really calling anyone stupid clearly lacking basic reading comprehension. Remember thalidomide - rolled wonderful new drug fully approved reduce morning sickness pregnant women?

And that's exactly regulation nowadays put place. medical community works like airline companies something like happens. gets studied holy hell, solutions proposed everyone retrained new protocols put place. problems (human error corruption mostly) happen, still 10x times safer Bleh. pretty civil response given quality post responded (or lack thereof) behind exactly

Fall behind elite schools afford better remedial education. Ever well-funded private school, even regular one ""good"" district? facilities, alumni networks smaller class sizes superior average public schools'. Even covid already big gap kids prepared bright future doomed struggle. masks allow little better . . [resource . . [resource States unlike fed allowed run deficits. 

Um yes are? Every State government deficit. 

Still undermine main point tho: Florida slavishly dependent Sales Tax levy income tax. DeSantis refusing balloon deficit go Herd Immunity approach (which basically means letting virus rip population devolve responsibility individual citizen). scummy position scummy dude. Social Darwinism action people. 

On top conservative retiree's moving refusing pay fair share actual Floridians thus vicious cycle created. wonder old school zicam zinc goo put nose would work Source? We're still first wave. never declined enough it. 

We need 2-month long nationwide lockdown. Everyone receives least $3,000/month. one except food supply chain people goes anywhere must wear mask. 

All CC student loan debts paid pennies dollar banks/lenders cancelled. pay corporations trillions, pay trillions. 

All rent, mortgage, car, etc. payments put hold. settle in, wait 2 months. it'll enough new cases pop properly contained future shorter targeted shutdowns necessary.

This serious disease, time go war it. like boxing match. winning, really tiring opponent. instead keeping body shots, lower hands, stand middle ring, let start wailing you.

You could TKO'd round 6 7. Instead, cut eye, winded, staggering around.

You regroup, fans happy game plan coach hoping throw towel.

But bright side, venue made food drink sales extra rounds. dont know peplle want see huge numbers Florida...but expect based behavior moron DeSantis charge likely under-statement. see difference spreading something known multiple times dangerous infectious flu pandemic start Aug 2019. Jan 16, 2020 SIG closed $30.13. quoted verbatim.

Wake up. mean I’m quelling naysayers haven’t seen lawsuits years big pharma exact reason companies still business...? live small/mid sized city Texas. exactly 1 free testing location. self administered mouth swab test hours weekends every week. need test time either find another free site dozens possibly hundreds miles away, pay private doctor/pharmacy. One friends drive 80 miles wife get tested. Another waited 3 weeks results. may old info last checked also needed doctor's orders confirmed exposure hospital pharmacies test also, short tests get everyone pays. top that, lot people still take seriously. They're basically acting everything normal going business, may wear mask, may wearing wrong. 

So yeah we're probably much worse numbers show.

Edit: also know accurate tests are. Lots false negatives. uncle ventilator classic covid symptoms still tested negative 3 days row positive came back.  choices 2 second search DuckDuckGo. it’s fucking dumb hate sound completely defeatist it, point I'd say safe say I've lost parents Fox News spell. 

We live far away interact person get house ... they've thoroughly drunk Conservative Kool-Aid can't even talk anything related matter without coming completely unglued. 

The victory claim matter finally realized nobody ""on side"" shut fuck politics around us. described obvious differences behavior. would expect good faith posters engage following:

mocking people take pandemic seriously, spreading disinformation narratives downplaying virus, circle jerk trolls urging innocent person recklessly expose others say love trump?

Where trump say promised coronavirus would go away April?

Why putting words everybody's mouths?

Way spread disinformation Respecting science obviously doesn’t require respecting every individual claims science. think well suggesting bleach injections. Yep. You’re dead death toll amongst **infected** far accurate picture survivability COVID-19. someone diagnosed potentially fatal condition, good physician discuss likelihood surviving disease. U.K., 9.6% infected die. U.S., 2.9% die: Fauci says you’re wave 1: you’re wave 1. That's really works, test faulty method test working scenarios. Agreed New York needs Brawndo sir! Yes, high false negative ratio agree. that's exactly vaccine needs tested thoroughly possible ensure isnt going cause even havoc line. like Trump agree policies. don’t. America piss poor condition protect Covid. almost inevitable America would shoot top public healthcare paid sick leave. Southern Americans aren’t exactly known pro-science stance either.

It would probably bit better democrat leadership, America would still dealing epidemic slightly smaller, similar scale. 

Americans piss poor attitydes towards things would truly mitigate pandemic (public healthcare sixk leave) would struggle hard regardless. 

Muh freedumbs also big reason. government thought right conduct entrance examinations 2 million students appearing getting average 90,000 cases per day . Even supreme court rejected plea students postphone exams situation might control. said sop's would implemented avoid spreading virus utterly failed execute leaving nation bad condition. Germans &amp; Swedes also often go like French though. idea Germans &amp; Swedes behaved French myth. typically believed self hating French population.

In fact huge ""covid hoax"" riots Germany nearly every week now. Serious question, black people need represented vaccine trials? reason believe vaccines would work differently black people compared white people? yep true What's over/under never hearing again? Good points Ok that’s great story answer question since reasoning three states’ lack income tax clearly right-leaning retirees insinuated case FL. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* program pretty biased poor students.

Life biased poor. least u/moshittyinbred's state objective standards apply everyone. wish worked aunt grandfather... kid Kinder, would absolutely part “Zoom school” (not blame effort). It’s developmentally appropriate kids age (I would argue older too) screens day. saying teacher teaches relatively young kids Zoom much day. specifically mention child example, would argue very, Kinder aged kids want anything else play. that’s normal- that’s learn. 
Good teachers teach play- hard Zoom. 

I think parents trying best (and many teachers too) it’s going work well younger kids. It’s one reasons schools Europe best keep younger students in-person school safely right now. clearest argument right O'Reilly Factor got sued back late 90s lying show, Fox News' lawyers argued reasonable person would thought O'Reilly Factor news, show technically entertainment program.

And realised audience purpose laid bare right single phrase. Merica business profit oriented, consider strong case opening everything up. Revenue bars restaurants theme parks. 

Not mention incredible bonanza hospital business infected people. Hospital treatment covid averages 30k per case, imagine Trump voting, underinsured, socialism-hating suckers sell homes raid retirement savings pay medical funeral bills. 
Can say ""wealth redistribution?"" ( good direction). shame doesnt everything full capacity

# Florida’s unemployment website coming glitches fixed

## Site back online Thursday morning it’s us prove WON’T labeled islamophobe left criticizing Islam? know it’s impossible prove negative right? kidding, don’t know much all. petty would point misspelled “labelled”. Also known *The Bertie Wooster Gambit*. point 8 atrrocious years Republican Governor voted Senator. person voting party. another explanation FL choose go ahead make Senator?

I see people saying **president**. Yes, got voted senator - point ""DeSantis president"" popular attitude, ""Scott president"" thing I'm saying people say experience course anecdotal. brother said me.

Well sucks brother jackass, literally everyone work massive republicans republican inlaws/have suffer friends family events consume fucking ton political media - I've never heard anything like that. once. DeSantis office hot minute, I've never heard anyone jumping gun. everyone. seeing Canadian plates driving around south florida. vaccine likely fully distributed administered months release. Expect masks mandates well next year, summer earliest, masks fall comes around everything goes back inside. yea, kind terrifying. Oh, mean:

Vaccine: $39.99

Syringe: $750.00

Disinfection Charges: $3,000

Doctor's Fees: $5,000

Vaccination area skin cleaning: $5,000

Post-Vaccination Bandaid: $950

Just-because-we-can charges: $15,000

Vaccination room use fee: $5,000

**TOTAL AMOUNT: $34,739.99**

Healthcare Insurance Discount: $25,000

Your Insurance paid: $5,000

**Your payment obligation: $4,739.99**

Seems high, forget: Insurance saved $30K!!! Need get first wave enter second third. US stuck first wave ever since March. Deaths cases never went extremely low levels like we've seen pretty much every country 2 weeks low end since quarantine locked to? Either then? (not talking asymptomatic people know)

But yeah, winter here...  made point lockdowns disastrous worse virus, claimed ""misinformation"", thought I'd explain completely wrong, far sound like disagree got full themselves. think influence outside hosts bodies. point...but point thought of. I’m interested thought process led conjure numbers 3 5 nowhere. AB, New Glarus Brewing. anywhere Wisconsin. part marketing. understand &amp; agree seems like something different said every day. make hard know think. Let's hope stays way. conservative right seems shifting right every single day. NY NJ got dicks rocked anyone really knew handle this. Compare FL, months time could observed learned NY/NJ disaster done good, effective job. Instead chose opposite. I'll look rec then. invited? Yh thats think harder compare Belgium countries count alot deaths covid i'd suggest trying hook nursing home, church, bridge club, bingo hall, collection people already exposed one another. whether cut one person's hair twenty, connected adding much risk, whereas cutting 20 people's hair disconnected exposed 20 different groups. must people starve governments forcibly prevent billions people earn living? I'm sure piece together answer champ viewer base. crazies none powerful Fox news. Article suggests ""protecting vulnerable working achieving herd immunity.""

You get virus once. Therefore ""Herd Immunity"" option.

When send healthy people work catch COVID-19 asymptomatic, carry disease directly vulnerable population. literally suggesting young people put grandparents immuno-compromised family members risk think ""young people working"" they're owned property.

We live world ancestors built kind automation keep us safe productive throughout epidemic, rich people claimed ownership it, rich people mad we're putting lives risk produce little extra. 2nd wave? No, don’t know can’t seem produce enough vit myself. least two clear benefits reducing community spread wherever can.

1) Treatments improved vastly last 6 months -- ICU fatalities dropped near 60% 30%. longer go less people sick people survive (and recover less severe acute symptoms) medical responses improve. Beyond capacity, one things we're supposed buying *time* science get better treating sick.

2) Long term consequences even mild infections remain unknown. Every person, regardless age physical health, better getting virus vaccinated compared becoming infected. could infecting 10k people per day instead 40k may preserve quality life millions Americans prevent Billions dollars long term medical costs.

In way locked pattern number people must get infected die. huge difference per capita infections deaths globally. choosing slow spread choosing *more* infections deaths, significantly larger number Americans willing make choice going change. Consider part.  Trump cuomo suck  see counter examples. F so? financial markets economy. They're buoyed tech stocks, online retailers, pharma, done well since pandemic started. companies going business publicly traded, exception brick mortar retailers way bankruptcy case. viewers whip mental gymnastics (for them) say - course said win lawsuit! say ""political tool used democracts"" say pandemic response worldwide?? U.S. Democrats situated every foreign government worldwide imposing lockdowns inflating deaths political goals U.S.?

Mindboggling. news doesent need age well viewer base idiots attention span goldfish Yes, did. took week feel energy flowing back body. made terrible mistake weeks back: pillbox empty thought maybe sunny days could without.... so. Spent week couch again. absolutely sure need pills ;) Damn it’s almost basic social structures place like developed nations could allow better pandemic response people stay home starve death One could argue OANN compares, good way. husband recently came something (not Covid tested). dog kept sniffing mouth wouldn’t leave side fever finally broke. found interesting watch everyday would get sniff several times day. Dogs detect raised blood sugar levels much more. really mans/woman’s best friends. Always protect us. truth there... articles jan-feb, april I'll always upvote handmaid references, given we're one supreme court.

That guy knows get upvotes! make stuff up. Florida's sales tax rules written expectation lots restaurant dinning would generating lots revenue.

Unprepared food, buy grocery store take home cook, zero sales tax. Prepared food, buy anywhere fast food franchise chain restaurants top end establishments, taxed 6% state rate + county optional rate (typically 0.5% - 2.0%). restaurants shut down, people ate home, tax revenue (from food) gutted. eating home, possibly drinking well, replaced bar tax rate bottle tax rate, lower. reopening bars restaurants is, least extent, effort restart state sales tax revenue.

Some states state income tax, lower sales tax rate. legislate based believe charge tax, get voted office so. COVID kicked Florida's plan nuts. Youyang Gu's model uses current data. dialysis data July. way contradict other.  Pardon ignorance didn’t India 21 day lockdown? think people actually functioning brain read studies current vaccines “lizards” yes. trusting people charge curing HIV/AIDs? How's vaccine going? don’t think he’s actually capable, he’s like super emotion reactionary. Youre right, probably reported 12 crew tested positive. tested 6 12 results negative. test 6 again. 
Probably set faulty tests. Rending garments well underway r/chicago Especially considering government absolutely bleeding money right bad vaccine released? catastrophic impacts absolutely everything. 

Releasing SAFE vaccine important thign world. Yeah, that’s true. Look up. Tuskegee lizard people tell that? ""reported"" Yes, medical expert. means he's qualified give medical advice, mean he's qualified make public policy decisions tell people live lives. literally ""chemicals water turning frogs gay"" side guess something usually causes specific problems symptoms defined condition yet. Maybe medicine/science aware it, eventually labeled condition. mean I'm sure people deficiency idea it. something doctors would normally test for. mean see point. wonder deficiency causes issues besides susceptibility coronavirus.

There's also way know deficiency. think labeling pre-existing condition could give false sense security people. someone pro-vaxx excited get COVID vaccine, I'm taking something Europe approves too. said, second approved I'll counting days turn take it. Murdoch done countless families 3 continents. Interesting could estimate way: take fraction asymptomatic covid positives assume group people affected seasonal allergies rate general population. quick dirty, probably pretty close. said masks nothing. Look up. It’s never going away. Non vaccines prevent infection. US either learns live virus slowly eat economy till nothing left. I'm certain political tone. 

How NY do, again? mash job opposing politics? 

Oh. Right. Nevermind. No, democrat policy born science. rest time though. vaccine also treatment makes nobody die it.

The countries beat locked houaes lol. Everything open now, pack stadions full. Well it’s pretty bad idea things indoors poorly ventilated spaces.

Wanting things normal great, abandoning precautions pretending things normal not.

And still consumption, pure consumption honest. kids snd events it’s bunch buying shit reason.

Parks, beaches, trails, takeout. open.

No need cram box watch characters make figure 8’s converted basketball courts. too, isn’t exclusive club expert mind? professor epidemiology Oxford. I'm talking states chose lock down. Cuomo issue locking New York City. think he's capable providing mental health services people to. he? 200k people died orders magnitude hospital. Yeah, blown. complaining covid keep around? open schools? Every time do, seems lead disaster, maybe not.

I appreciate conversation. agree point here, however. There's article Washington Post today, instance, points fact child mortality remains low despite fact we're eight months pandemic. disasters? Schools Europe large remained open whole time. like, wait, mean less massive chains dragged reefs destroying pristine habitat marine wildlife? Oh no... talking FL reopening prematurely get sweet sales tax dollars... intelligent states also rely sales tax delaying save lives... get lost? Want pictures? Fuck pandemic fascism maybe obvious causal mechanism? Oh. Okay. Makes sense. would thought putting together children would make virus spread fast. Flu season going great time. /s I'd rather millions upon millions people starve

Don't all, must starve? reason agriculture continue pandemic? 

If problem supply chain distribution, seems like would fall category ""general mismanagement"".  truth obvious Rupert Murdoch cancelled birthday celebrations travel plans due tonCOVID concerns. It’s disgraceful stood media interests encouraged people ignore gravity threat. He’s partly responsible high number deaths. Citation, please. Oh, find someone symptomatic upon subsequent infection. ONE guy China found carrying virus mandatory screen. civil war part deux states looming.

Y'all need turn Reddit days... Yup This, honestly I’ve seen situation play many times people still aren’t taking seriously. don’t think one guy putting change collective mindset point. Except Kenney. Alberta fed figurative wolves.  great suggestions though - could fill survey? www.swanthonyswan.com/winteriscoming

Your answers (absent personal info) shared others www.swanthonyswan.com/communitycovid worldviews besides narrow perspective represented. telling do? yet experience person isn’t taking covid seriously would change mind reading something like this. really really think deniers change mind reading this?

I talking people know, also deniers general. Stupid stupid Turkey forces everybody wear mask go public also seeing spikes. Blame teachers refusing return back school.  China flooding country cheap fentanyl.  Honestly, needed reminder. Thank  hate term “believe science” isn’t joke. Same, feeling pain. born lockdown good. wife hard time seeing friends post Facebook eating places normalized stuff. trying hold hard her. keep reminding her, point lockdown protect us cannot help idiots want pretend everything right. would cover Trump 5 years taxes! think fact cashiers aren’t dropping dead clue you’d probably safe grocery stores unless elderly serious Pre existing conditions. fact, Chinese cities experienced similar lockdowns, less strict Wuhan. example, Wuhan shut public transports within city lockdown began, cities, buses subways still running much lower service level carried like 1/10 regular daily ridership.

&amp;#x200B;

The lucky part China outbreak lockdown happened right Chinese New Year began. time, schools, factories business shutdown coming holidays already. Students workers returned home stayed families important festival year. lockdown began, cause much chaos compared places world. many Chinese, felt like experiencing absurdly extended Chinese New Year holidays, usually last seven days normal years eventually like month 2020.  Interesting. hospitals Mumbai gotten better yet? heard bad summer. sources information? India interesting case study huge lockdown essentially failed saying true. Dude, know Covid-19 eradicated flu? also death old age?  join you. Yeah kgb never disbanded. became Russian government.  One question considered somehow associated US liberals/Democrats? even based US party affiliation. ITT: People actually read Fauci said. Goodluck breathing lungs that're filled pink froth dead red blood cells lung fluids. 


Every public health official mother yelling idiots since day 1. hope he's taking bed someone paid attention. do, restrictions lifted, correct? businesses still shutdown? could anticipated. Fauci one ones tried to. Homophobia largest problem. guess case came first, chicken egg? nobody denies COVID-19 virus. Sorry. states trust? don’t trust Florida’s numbers either. live Florida anyone wants get tested get tested. think people sick going get tested. Shifting baselines. post board COVID sending millions extreme poverty. Pretty sure?

I'd bet house it! worse think tbh, want name pretty popular UK.

We 4 staff members catch Covid last month, due nature job close proximity sharing equipment etc throughout day without things sanitised. management cleaned store even 3/4 occasions. one told self-isolate even go get Covid test found colleagues tested positive, change definition time saying exposures count, **(they wanted us verify CCTV close contact colleague 15+ minutes saying could go isolate)**. fact person went self-isolate manager barely even contact colleague question.

We told management can't refuse customers without mask ""safety measures place"" cloth mask.

We also share equipment customers many transactions without given adequate time clean anything between, many customers coughing without masks on.

I'm 100% going catch Covid soon starts spreading faster, means family catch too. can't anything jobs moment bills pay.

This clearly happening country many different sectors government lax measures introduced. least way enforcing masks fining companies choose put profits first health staff customers. can’t imagine ~800 cases whole country anymore. many cases county US within last day two. Never mind rest country  told something feels scammy, probably is. door door ""surveyor"" scammy day age? lot family 40 min west Chicago. It’s crazy difference soon leave metro area. Prove Ffs; go Facebook buy/sell/free. Nobody needs pissy negativity. lock down, happened already Gällivare

Wrong. given sources say exact recommendation FHM.

No, municipality. FHM say anything far bit fluid definition lock down

Lockdown means people stay place are. Gällivare people still could walk, bike, fly, swim, take car city centre. People advised stay home. People advised restrain movement certain area around come terms parts Sweden tougher travel restrictions Denmark

I see problem Sweden restrictions. Denmark hand also second wave right now, think misread comment

Diseases something called R factor average number people someone virus infect. R factor 2, sick person get 2 sick, spread. R factor .5, 50% chance given infected person spread one person get better (a spread 2 more, called superspreaders, looking averages).

If disease X, R factor 2, course disease likely expose 2 people virus way give them. one two people vaccinated, get it.

But get 2 people sick, people get 2 people sick, get 2 more, etc. Think like tree constantly splitting branches. one people would gotten sick vaccinated, half tree gone. complications groups common contacts, I'm keeping simple.

If enough people vaccinated, disease keeps hitting ""dead ends,"" infecting someone get anyone else sick. contains virus, since even though people still get sick, can't get safe.

If vaccinate 80% population, drop R factor 2 0.4, means infected folks dead ends virus, quickly drops small portion population. need 100% vaccination (which good infants get right away, immunocompromised folks can't get it, etc), enough people refuse vaccine, allows virus still spread, slowly (and generally communities refuse vaccine).

Abstract
Objectives: multifaceted disease manifestation COVID-19 requires longitudinal characterization symptoms, aid screening disease management. Methods: Phone interviews follow-ups completed 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, 6 week period. Results: one symptom disease onset experienced ~70 patients. one third patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, muscle ache first symptom. fatigue reported, usually first symptom appear. Smell taste changes occurred 3.9 ± 5.4 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± SD) since disease onset emerged first symptoms 15% 18% patients, respectively. Fever shortest lasting symptom (5.8 ± 8.6 days (mean ± SD), **smell taste changes long-lasting symptoms (24.3 ± 22.9 days 19.4 ± 19.1 (mean ± SD), respectively), longer smell recovery correlated smell change severity. one third patients reported cough, smell taste changes, symptoms persisted negative RT-PCR tests.** Conclusions: symptom occur first later, though likely appear firsts, typically one symptom occurs disease onset. severity olfactory change associated recovery time. Lack chemosensory recuperation recovered patients common. findings aid patients illness provide expected recovery patterns Sorry, even read link?

There absolutely multiple causes go outcomes-- socioeconomic status, access health care, occupational exposure, etc., probably significant genetics. 

However, countries also seeing Covid-19 outcomes vary ethnicity, even socioeconomic factors different. 

Does prove there's ethnically-linked genetic risk factor? No. data suggestive enough need mindful possibility design clinical trials vaccines treatments. 

When clinical trial, want get representative sample population. always challenging U.S.-- volunteers disproportionately university students workers fields health care life sciences. African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American populations underrepresented occupation groups. 

When ""Operation Warp Speed"" vaccine trials got started, time pressure great medical community mostly signed anyone met protocol, without making big effort multi-ethnic inclusion. understandable, given dire situation. 

What understand larger effort get multi-ethnic volunteers later sets clinical trials. Hopefully groups like NMA (the Black doctors' group) help fix that. waves add waves anyway

Bad reputation could easily destroy business interest keep good relationship customers. might linked number deaths UK care homes. government basically let virus run rampant care homes, obviously full people _extremely_ likely die COVID. disagree, America country disregard national public health experts.

I talking Germany, per article, countries, also suggest US country regarding experts. making income taxes gas taxes. fair, life doctor pretty busy (as people's lives). joke either end skipping lot meals losing weight residency gain weight lots fast food, limited time exercise... 

&amp;#x200B;

Not people's lives can't also be.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also say extra potential flag depression burnout doctor. doctor knows exactly they're health, says something mental state... dare call myopic, short-sighted maybe, myopic... even know means! Yikes stay home people don’t want cautious. It’s foolproof plan. hope! Instead messing around another 5 years, send every resident decent, standardized $100 mask / respirator 4 months filter replacements? Send filters needed, Post Office already going send masks start clusterfu** anyways. 
Can government contract design also work / airlines (air bag drop-downs compatible)? Quite kickstarted designs general guide. Use Corona panel solve something instead shelling billions quarterly avoiding taking step towards actual solution. new Lamborghinis, upgrades PC, new console, protection. Unknown unknowns, amirite??? americans wouldn’t know thing “liberty” “freedom” even slapped red hats suspicious, turtlefacts It’s bullshit. data heart conditions? Oh it’s 78% cases...oh shit, don’t publish that. middle-aged white guy.. totally trust Black doctors panel FDA. Good Ship Coronas Illinois balanced budget written constitution still balanced budget almost 20 years. states hurting right worse others. gonna pay them? generous you

if not, can't really stay home they? masks another 6 months December I'd like life back. I'd like job lost come back. I'd like schools reopen send cousins. I'd like sister able research project get good PhD program it. I'm done. case, don’t keep simple go back 100% normal effective immediately across entire world? mortality rate (relatively) low COVID. way whole world could eventually contract it, would approach 100% herd immunity?  
My favorite thing subreddit lets see real-time reactions lockdown advocates realize they're longer majority. smooth. Like glass. that’s leadership it’s cowardice  Let introduce second wife... akin saying one drive all.

Don't act morally superior. Lockdowns causing huge amount suffering world wide. also get people want ""get with"" quickly possible, getting everyone infected quickly possible.

This leads *massively* higher fatality rates, covid well causes, hospitals health systems become overwhelmed. love living FL, man really grate cheese.

I made last necessary grocery run weekend, going fortify house stay inside foreseeable future. curbside pickup door deliveries

I hope naysayers ones really feel hurt stupid decision, know innocent people going suffer. Yikes First, never blame African Americans trusting damn thing country, good them.

Secondly, kinda wonder group women doctors thing. often, stuff tested men, effects women come (sometimes nasty) surprise later on. I'm five feet tall, small, medicine goes wonky shit me. can't see friends family even wanted bc several days drive plane ride away everyone know (I mean technically could want risk neither family members). Pandemicing new place kids social interaction support system, freaking nightmare. I'm glad husband took job pays way (before covid, transitioned military), thinking could travel instead see family. worked REAL well. keep piling Covid.  cases like NYC, take things account:

1. Hospitals overwhelmed, limiting ability doctors give proper care.
2. Doctors really know treat virus even *weren't* overwhelmed. lot advances since then, reducing ventilator usage, using dexamethasone, etc. lowers IFR.
3. NYC's population vulnerable average due climate demographic factors like amount vitamin deficiency would present early year city mostly non-white population.
4. There's also argument viral dose affects chances getting severe infection; people NYC often exposed huge viral doses enclosed spaces doctors still denying masks help (or even telling people harmful).

IFR static universal; changes depending things like demographics, availability treatment, mask usage etc. He’s fucking idiot. Yeah, well Russia see Germany threat.  therefor deal disinformation campaign. track record reflect that. course wasn’t “purely political” per rules, fun. think every single case America since inception COVID detected? called someone earlier thread heartless feel death old person death young person.

When dying preventable cause. keep leaving adding caveats. arguing think terrible feel way, think people feel way whether admit not.

If first thought hear someone dying ""ok, old sick they?"" fact terrible way feel people feel way. people empathy feel bad loss response shooting, reality would deeply effected 5 year old got shot face.

Exactly, defending someone essentially that? Someone said uncle died response basically ""but sick he?"" hypothetical kid bringing conversation. belittled man's death diabetes. defending it. talks herd/cross immunity immunity well documented phenomenon known literal hundreds proven something base policy on. 

Extreme measures like lockdowns school closures demand substantial evidence.

Where evidence lockdowns save life look example Texas - opened wide up, cases skyrockets started approaching point overwhelming hospitals, rolled back openings (bars still closed Texas unless 51% food sales) mandated masks numbers plummeted several weeks.

Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Cool going cherrypick. explain Peru ended highest COVID death rate world despite strict + early lockdown. explain Florida Arizona lower mortality rates NY, NJ, CT, declining cases months despite minimal restrictions. pretty crowded small narrow trails People idiots. That’s why. upvote. really sorry, maybe give ventilator someone tried best follow covid guidelines got idiot like him. Zero pity Quarantine Florida go rarely haven’t bands break yet rarely wear hour time go grocery store. 

When bands break get worn set aside hang onto possible last resort supplies dry up. elastic bands break would sew new ones machine.

Edited answer last question. far reusing respirators two three weeks setting aside new one. set aside masks longer used saving every single one, case. exactly point. left adopting us vs mentality abhor conservative voting base. IMO makes easier conservatives stick fingers ears scream hear something don’t like. Flu shots make powerful. would anyone say powerup. get started one seems warning Vitamin going winter months.

What mean this? information widely available? People want cautious stay home. second wave comes third wave? get once? got downvoted, comment framed put display instead. awards, I'd give you. like saying laws drunk driving, hey - one FORCING anyone go drive around drunk fools, even public sidewalk. basically advocating giving irresponsible people total control people trying follow sensible rules.

The real issue display see - TON people country suffering low level sociopathic narcissism, can't even see past need immediate gratification enough protect (much less others) *harm*. sad. consider anti-vax stance.

This along lines researchers seeing issue trials sample distribution (i.e., reflective target population)  Survival fattest er mean fittest. Yeah numbers easy manipulate fit narrative since number tests changes. think finally starting see rapid test results. sure 30,000 new cases today equal 30,000 new cases July certainly 30,000 cases April. Dumb question: I've seen people talk bad flu seasons take number confirmed dead extrapolate number based excess mortality similar. Would mean even though we've confirmed million people died covid poorer/overwhelmed places would likely far death? statistics people done far?  title shit. someone explain many articles sound like they’re bad example grammar text book? tell us ""don't worry, virus mutates slowly non-crucial sequences""?

It's still true. virus mutates slower influenza virus mutation viruses inconsequential, times even detrimental virus survival beneficial hosts. time time new mutation appear makes virus virulent dangerous. good identify early on. 

If mutation positively selected confirmed well characteristics. Good keep eye careful daily routines. 

On hand, worry social distancing, masks, etc positively select virulent mutations. Ain't gonna happen. bright side, longer careless people building immunity rest us. Well... proven.. less 50 cases re-infection different straing, atleast read. compared 33 million far infected World.  So, may right immunity getting may last, still sure long immunity lasts vaccine. antibodies t-cells fight infection. 

Most reinfections LESS severe even asymptomatic. havent read reports cases, last showed US. 

The biggest advance made outside long term seasonal vaccine covid, working treatment lower risk death long term side effects. SImilar treatments flu like ""Tamiflu"" Sometimes it’s better admit numbers aren’t clear. We’re 6 months this. long term numbers don’t exist yet. articles challenge impression COVID isn’t threat young people, people simply get bout illness it. dangerous misconceptions drive poor behavior continuation pandemic. important info there. mouse. spoken. exact logic caused chlamydia pandemic since 1970s. Ikr. Everyone mask warpath nobody mentions eating out. That's *crazy* go sit restaurant hour eat. Helped survive something 0.1% chance killing he’s old underlying health issues.

Damn lucky skill there. Bet ""do"" social-distancing. Also bet wear masks ""like can't"". advanced electronic nose future smell diseases like coronavirus. Another good idea make vision board. I've never done one 36 years, I'm middle making one now. used pandemic catalyst make big life-changing plans implemented already. Gotta vision board remind I'm working toward life self-isolation. 

Btw bragging - I've also days failed get bed, I'm struggling even little exercise, mental health daily struggle. wanted share positives. I'm talking cases started increasing rather level. Can't see that? *"" got underlying health issues ""*

That know of. hate say one things pandemic teaching authoritarian governments may place. average person appears fucking moron need force obey. Yes, may helpful. may want take along something fatty help absorption though, since it’s fat-soluble. lunch would good idea.  mandate flu shots what's stopping mandating coronavirus vaccine out? Flu vaccines decades, covid one new tested long deal cards casino night fun night parties (like businesses yearly rewards holiday parties?). work summer bc gathering restrictions. finally got one last weekend, told venue requiring masks. 

I go inside dealers on, one 100 patrons. first figured bc still eating assumed they'd put games opened nope! people came table wore bit, til got talking drinks. 

The people wearing masks 3 hours dealers. I'm kinda worried busy season gets going, middle winter. Aka, ""indefinitely"". sub hilarious, post literally anything long promotes covid deadlyness spread it. 

But post video 20+ year accredited PhD Viral Experts fact analysis goes mainstream narrative removed mods told disinfo bad source, lol.


But random articles anonymous ""covid whistlenarcers"" good.

Too funny!!! hear? Florida declared virus defeated... what's use masks anything like anymore. signs appease libs actually expect follow them. reason? People keep pretending like things can't get worse. poor decisions keep made. It’s pretty hard make comparison pro family Republican law makers responsible majority public sex incidents let alone sex public sex incidents.

That’s pretty intense projection right many issues contending top hypocrisy party. I’m anti-American friends warned fuck libs doesn’t mean things Republicans do. Liberals type shitty.

So literally again. Looking stereotypical image fat Americans?

No. felt pit stomach recent surge driven colleges decided great idea person learning. asked students really nicely follow social distancing via loyalty pledge. College students continuing go drinking, partying, etc. We're still big 10 football games. embarrassing watch local university fighting health department. Honestly, we're going continue ""fuck it"" path we're currently well get winter flu hit. Obviously everyone. see street time though. Looking you, Brady st. didn’t say flying airplane guess it’s legit.  us know idea spreads large droplets point myth. Fortunately everyone seems take virus measles infect. This, along every post like it, entirely anecdotal. speaks nothing statistics. smell Covid, need step car.... Meanwhile US... Hip hip hooray I've given know anything corruption going part slowly leak next couple years. I'm exhausted like gain much besides assholes getting less votes it. Damn :-|

Could case whenever call goes need new presidential candidate, smart ones take step backwards?

I mean, right mind would actually volunteer job, anyway?

On positive note, must *something* good current fella's done, there?

Over here, hear bad/crazy shit that's going on, surely actual improvements incumbent president instigated occupying oval office?

I mean, guys supposed able fill library time hand reins next man? would suck library filled tragedies picture books. it'll still months vaccinate medical workers vulnerable, everyone else.

Either way working vaccine still heavens sent, swings back scale sanity, whoever wants get protection gets not, deal time herd immunity reached.

US comment, worry. still thinking human advice good. No, workers fault. one putting life line rage anti-maskers minimum wage retail job. store owners hiring well-paid security deal assholes. (Here's example mean murderous rage anti-maskers - ) worth keeping mind Montana currently 8th lowest COVID death rate country (162 deaths / 1M) 9th lowest number per capita total cases (11,328 cases / 1M), *really* hit hard yet. Second wave prep doc! Thats something do. would great thing save look back Unbelievable local hair salon posted installing system. read online school system well. idea cost effectiveness sounds interesting actually works obtuse.

Why can't people admit policy negative side effects? somehow dying making next film glum old guy beating Chinese neighborhood RNA genes shared coincidentally with... genes. Let leave that. But, say evidence zoonosis. None. That's fact.

Fuck kirchner maduro They'll reach 10 million sooner US. Here's latest case/death charts Texas, running 7-day cases indeed trending higher again.

Texas currently ranks 18th per capita Im Atlantic Canada. majority ppl favour travel restrictions. recent court case charter rights found restrictions reasonable due pandemic.
 - speculation aside - strong evidence antibodies wane. normal lot coronaviruses. honestly understand people worked this. I'd pay double opportunity join long line punchers worry, endless supply idiots. People failed math see percentages work like Polarizing Tweets Russian Trolls Vaccination Targeted Groups ~~2016~~ 2020 Man, methodology study bad.

It would hard get data reinfection matter what. knowledge mechanism, good news. heard tv show morning I'm seeing here. think ever heard unsung brute today. odd “Run course?” mean like New York City shut March June slow staged openings based careful monitoring positive rates ~80,000 tests/day? 

The New York City we’ve holding steady 1% positive rates months primary sources new infection tourists bringing state, small religious communities?

New York City, everybody—with pretty overwhelming consistency—wears goddamn masks like real grownups functioning brains actual empathy understanding can’t beat virus individually? 

New York, heard ambulance sirens 24/7 quite literally weeks end, walked past refrigerator trucks corpses outside local hospitals? know fast progress could vanish, easily could slip back reality, people dying droves, alone separated families, behind walls hospitals crowded take new patients? 

If “run course” mean that, then, yes, that’s right. Kids sponges younger, thats shown learning 2nd language much easier start early. Missing year quality education brains open development good. simultaneously... Okay could please link data explains talking about. actually good thing think better prepared next pandemic.

Sure. going hilarious fall/winter coronavirus death surge happen. go ahead cancel Thanksgiving Christmas year, safe? gloomers disappointed. Pretty much entire sunbelt hit peaks July. doubt Florida's much ""reopening."" appears virus' seasonality manifests differently depending region's climate. temperate climates (like European countries US Northeast) seem earlier much sharper, shorter curves whereas tropical climates (US South, Mexico, etc.) seem longer flatter curves much later peak. See, e.g., two clusters daily death rate graph various selected countries: (which phenomenal worth watching entirety) talks phenomenon around 19-minute mark. Fuck Disney. Yup. Think rough is. 

It means education bad often people redo highschool classes preform college level. 

Now think people never go college. Karen alert Shared airspace, ventilation. Erc understanding, well. means seeing cases rising, pretending plotting. Nobody wants COVID one intentionally causing global pandemic. 0.00013%, shouldn’t subtract incredible impact disease world shame much death could avoided. #Take CDC back think people realize considered little chubby obese considered fat morbidly obese. already breach 1 million?

It doesn’t work way.

A full complete spread COVID would mean millions deaths US would take years unfold.

Along fact people get (other strains same) again, don’t really understand longer term effects virus. cases pulmonary scaring potential damage internal organs - even asymptotic cases. Spot Call cynicism sadly, agree it. absolutely incredible many people disregard health experts basic logic instead build trust act selfish manner. cooperate basic health advices, wear mask, believe freaking dumb obviously irrealistic conspiracy theories. society, sad, wonder there's surge covid see this... Sounds like bullshit tbh. reference source? Here's latest case/death charts New Jersey, running 7-day curves look great - cases deaths close flatlined. 

NJ ranks #1 per total capita deaths however. They're currently 181.15 deaths per 100k population, almost triple US per capita average trusted now? think mostly right, little caveat think get chest cause lot people seem understand it: Coronavirus potencial seriously undermine probably collapse global civilization, loss immunity proven fact years vaccine proves immunize long periods (if ever get one) become yearly think like flu deadlier; restrictions, masks hygiene help much taking large toll economy, small airlines closing around, happen big ones start closing? happen tourism? Restaurants? Private schools? Parks? Movie theaters? Sure adapt question adapt fast enough, many industries hit gaining (quite time sell masks cheap laptops) overall effect economic shrinking leaders world still growth costs mentality. Imagine small community able get rid new cases, would reluctant let people in? would happen country community? effect isolationism global scale? even advanced ever still don’t understand lot science takes tons time money running both. people don’t take vaccine ones vulnerable virus. already gave 99.8% chance surviving virus. vaccine 75% effective, personal risk drops level don’t care about.

Deaths aren’t showing long term affects virus. Long term affects issues saying don’t exist. massive amount proof even weren’t sick enough hospital still reporting feeling fatigued weeks/ months after. mean, sure, Thursday higher. 

But lowest months, also lowest Monday months. completely clear covid

maybe reinfections real reinfections virus flaring Yes, has. Remember everyone saying covid *wouldn't* slow summer weather. would opposite true.

Also, dont care downvotes. wrong opinions masses nothing concern me. American even look like? absence everything else ethnic? Reality TV? Hyperbolic formula movies single aspect even suggesting resemblance anything real? Little petty slapping fights like now? America fuck yeah! mean, right US easily distinguishable. Guy credible deep 💩 must peer review asp 😬 probably thing immunity.

To clear: thing *sterilizing* immunity necessary prevent spread virus generate herd immunity. debt GDP means never increase rates. Interest rates rising cause government debt, massive amounts corporate debt unserviceable. stuck debt trap. Without stimulus, $1 Trillion deficits. Even balance budget, would take serious cuts would keep us rates could still rise. Yes, Eurodollar system means short term dearth dollar demand matter much print, printing much right now. QE deflationary vacuum. Without lending growth, getting inflation Fed needs battle deflation...hence Powell begging Congress act. Stimulus bills diminishing returns terms propping collapse demand structural damage done economy including permanent changes consumer behavior. 

We first leg crisis. cascade #1, pain masked first round stimulus. Again, going diminishing returns effectiveness. play out, temporary job losses become permanent, companies come bigger waves layoffs. hospitality industry collapsing. still massive wave commercial residential loan defaults horizon. means nothing. fact got preprints peer-reviewed means take massive grain salt. plenty faculty universities frequently put shoddy work support. Quite frankly, now, paper shit. Sweden claimed herd immunity, number deaths experienced given country irrelevant whether achievable. I'm sorry got laid off. laid (during Great Recession) awful. 

Do think quarantined successfully, real lockdown, could've gotten back normal easily? fair, would important part teaching critical thinking.

Only problem leave crucial parts lesson. Well I’ve heard talking points figured seriousness dont guys get sick tired complaining bitching everyday reddit coronavirus.

Every time check see 3 threads over. honestly like lot people WANT corona stay around reason hate president. sad would rather miserable like ""see im right"" 

Bottomline corona issue WAY overblown. disagree basically lost cause. optimistic thinking side uplift poor. 

I need look California ruling years see treat poor. Seriously though, heard Tuskegee? could argue though worst part iraq war itself, aftermath, doomed fail start. 

But recall predicting aftermath got. Freedom-sucking destabilization. I’m nobody. I’ve never understood people didn’t consider likely outcome. mean offense all. always puzzled me. Don’t think anything concrete yet I’m afraid.

Yup, frustrating. like people throwing specific numbers feel made least fudged cherry picked numbers, strongly think guy 7% number. would love see data pulled from. work senior living facility, honestly first times happened caught guard resident got close. make worse, whole community self-imposed quarantine getting first positive case 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Fucking retarded. wife spec. Ed teacher get caseload huge head would pop. already works way hard kids parents show little appreciation. Teachers way underpaid way appreciated.

It ""aged well"" people like first place. Fox viewers get COVID-19, end rescued ICU, still resent hospital staff ""playing along hoax.""

It's going change matter facts are. Anti-intellectualism war gullible American hearts decades ago. That's civil war inevitable. got email yesterday kid (5) school Amsterdam, principal got infected, visitor school last week Monday, 12 staff members quarantine classes continue. colleagues school closed healthy teachers available. feels weird open schools, planning longer break coming weeks. could degree protection,

That means _probably_ wind ICU, still get infected pass vulnerable people die -- opposite herd immunity. boy, want read stuff news then. think everyone concerned!! sure? flu shots cost money Italy? thought kind social insurance free all. know, never Italy, maybe real Italian chime in. Awesome thanks! It’s interesting hear different perspectives topic. :) isnt straight propaganda.. Thought passed million dead yesterday.

Being skeptical agencies' messages supporting latest scientific evidence censored white house seems appropriate me. Can't wait negative comments users sub guns, trucks freedom subreddits. know, big tough guys could easily take torture need compensate actual fears weaknesses. Don’t think anything concrete yet I’m afraid. go “maybe” concrete evidence presented. years there’s consensus permanent effects. Florida lifted ton restrictions opened businesses full capacity. Downtown Orlando insanely packed day according friend working shop saw went home. Nobody wearing masks social distancing.


It's insane here. People take things wrong way assume since business open everything's over.

Going wait see happens next week two. believe something going administered literally billions people global.scale may well administered generations take absolutely every precaution possible ensure safety?

Truly sign country rotten core political struggle supercedes public good. Correct. pay healthcare taxation. 

Lets say wife lived there. combined income 160,000 would taxed 34%. 

In america 24%

$54,000 taxes versus $38,000 here. $18,000 difference. pay 850 month insurance, 10,200. Add pocket max 6000 spend 16,200 still brings us 1800 ahead. 

Lets pretend live Melbourne instead Montgomery county Maryland. 

Melbourne 10% sales tax Maryland 6% sales tax. 

It gets complex. would love higher taxes worry paying healthcare. sucks sometimes. Really interesting read. Never knew. awful. racism xenophobia subreddit always pops anything China posted.

Yes callousness bad. Reddit last thing go. fact, someday mods admins give free end. Wow, that's pretty high. realize entire economy country relies states, right? fat long healthcare system Florida reaches max capacity, month? two? mean people realize can’t seen hospital, won’t shatter myth idea eventually? buy brand name. Oh let kids use god given immune system die anyway. masks, send school. let country open old people medically compromised people stay home/S

Exact argument tried refute today.

It's tiring. 

And end changed nothing pointing scientific principles ethics truth.

I'm tired bullshit people comes pandemic.

So tired it.

It's conversation every time end result same. feel like shit people stupid. feel fine thoughts propaganda worked harder longer period time could ever hope to. I'm certain 2021 worse 2020. deaths virus, plus aggregation problems accumulated little little 2020. 

But no, one extra month lockdowns April, national coordinated response.

""oh well""  too. work grocery store, pre-covid people would come sick hell, running fevers, coughing, know get soup.

True story: little elderly man come in, could tell sick, tells flu got back China. early December. mid late Dec almost us sicker ever lives, several us inhalers, couple pneumonia weeks, one us tested positive flu. ""But told grocery companies stockpiling goods could say shortage order artificially raise prices!"" /s
I work industry... get complaints lot. increase testing cause rise cases positivity rate 25%. earth still considered valid counterpoint?

It's valid, brainwashed monkeys cling trump try gaslight thinking is. Lol terrifying. reason make one worse. depend individual’s circumstances. people may losses—brain fog symptoms taste/smell symptoms. Well look actual video, it’s pretty diverse cross-section potential COVID cases.  don’t get reaction thread ALL. Like, wearing mask day months don’t even notice anymore, effects life much putting socks morning. You’d think Fauci padlocking people homes based reaction, Jesus Christ. think New Year's Eve it. People want leave 2020 behind move on. Yes, Kenosha, literally step bodies street walk pharmacy. mask. fine. I'm huge fan either, I'll take slight discomfort 30 minutes grocery store asshole. Yeah, hey ""just let rip get with"". Sure that's good idea. swear bajeezus South Florida insane. reason June spike start them. F Even extreme early lockdowns like New York California, lockdown states still skyrocketing cases. amazon sells home kit $80. ended happening Disneyworld FL? would guessed giant spikes cases, seem remember headlines cases amount Cast Members proliferating (suppressed park management), kind lost thread it. I'm canadian, talking moron contractor know. ~65 yrs old, smoker, grumpy AF, snowbird. can't wait head FL start winter. 

I asked he'd let border, started cussing walked away, lol. would spreading then, unless worse feature? best bet infectious, less severe. reuse old cereal box I'm talking suggestion anyone wants DeSantis president. good kid Seems impossible contact tracing go that, course lower better. big middle finger Floridians health it’s big middle finger entire country. need strict travel bans starts state right fucking here. airlines good faith bus people state rest country world? really blows mind . tired complaining fighting.

This generally. division US today worst lifetime. 

We discussions best improve education system, reduce Healthcare costs cover people, best address threat posed climate change, reduce deficit without hurting people least afford hurt, properly fund space program explore universe, etc. 

Instead fighting people's ""right"" wear mask worst pandemic 100 years, whether acceptable president refuse commit peaceful transition power, whether climate change hoax, OK political party ram hyperpartisan Supreme Court Justice less 6 weeks election straight party line vote 4 years refusing even hold hearing nominee party 9 *months* election. 

I'm tired fighting division, we're tearing country apart petty partisan bullshit. recently went Wisconsin first place went gas station pick soda. 2AM person woman getting cigarettes without mask. person saw without mask. Maybe gas station thing. amoeba stuff terrifying

~~Pepperidge Farm~~ remembers... can't eat mask on. I've tried.

The cool thing restaurants soon host seated infectious take mask off, soon get use bathroom, become infectious again. * Everyone congregates indoors cold 
* Large indoor holiday gatherings 
* Depressed immune systems due cold, less exercise, low vitamin I’d agree attitude realise you’re also victimising anyone immune systems weak can’t get measles vaccine. Lots people charge things Florida need go prison asap. Crimes humanity assorted bullshit. Come naive, know means **it's time start cranking revenue** relative still regained taste smell months battling Covid. bakes bread regular basis hoping day senses return. go tell hasn’t really suffered anything still ability job. Depends live, get it. DC 80% people wearing masks, 100%. Come play us means holidays coming Disney wants Halloween Christmas worshipers come in. hard dirtbag every day? Honest question. Given up?! mother fuckers never tried cared begin with.

The proudly ignorant need fuck fix shit. area gets hurricanes. friends stocked everything useful reflex first storms season developed. We’d eaten/used hoarded pandemic supplies then.

Think need toilet paper though. Yes, thank you. could back normal now, taken seriously.  Exactly. ancestors went war. People showing weakness lack character. Judging Sweden's perfomance currently, maybe lockdown longer necessary point especially 6 months businesses consumers longer handle lack economic flow.

I think bad thing Florida reopening. I'll wear mask, I'll take vaccine, want concerts, events, bars back Fauci. Also, dude lied masks, lets forget that. Stop holding like saint. people lied position. Oak Creek WI’s community page full people call people wear masks social distance “sheep” fact reason many people sick dying WI. Could impact earning potential.

Honestly? me, *scariest* part. Like things people saying, ""oh I'm young die"", but, like, might trouble forming coherent thoughts *for rest life*. 

Your work might take hit. 

Your ability connect coach children (if that's something that's cards you). 

So scary. point, amount helps pre-November.

After January, start actually saving lives. USA.... embarrassment No, lockdowns. Due pandemic, downplayers anti-maskers causing become worse getting way policies restore safety certainty. Instead, gaslight throw wrench mix we're left knowing end entire burden pandemic people care - majority. Frankly think attitude part problem. I'm immune it. we're conflicted sides, constituency galvanized. Now's time. Looking approval rating among Republicans, concern sides. Could false negatives. probably know since work public health, PCR tests false negative rate around 25%-30%.

I honestly would never take mask moment around others. would go outside car eat. Agreed dislike word things way. Viruses sentient anything ""in response"" anything doing. virus could randomly mutate way makes resistant vaccines developed. spreads, higher chance random mutation could occur. Antibiotic vaccine resistant viruses tendency become prevalent variants variants eradicated, least severely reduced numbers, medical intervention.  fellow NYC’er fuck idiot coworker. Don’t sign waiver returning land 2k fine? worked DAMN HARD here. don’t care people call snitch I’d rat ass fast. would cases go winter though? would expect states weather changes, people would stay home instead going cold. imagine lot cases summer people hanging enjoying weather. people becoming complacent safety something cold weather?  Wow informative. feel like comment changed entire outlook education system unfair is. Thank posting this. Gulp Silver lining covid may disappear Nov 3rd. luck get sealed bracelet indicates given vaccine. Everyone need wear enough world vaccinated consider herd immunity everyone take off. Secret?!? Also aware citizens common sense.  10 every 1 million? huge lost productivity! many employes need transport 1 million tests? count employes produce tests employes subsidiaries companyes produce plastics boxes... Bankers money transfers, currency exchange, guys maintaining entire digital operations lot people working areas, quality inspectors, secretaries... 😂🤣 It’s I’ve literally seen 3 people (including store workers) wear masks. That’s it, I’m exaggerating, people really don’t give fuck progress made here, we’re going go right back March. shit last time. 

I doubt that. People mostly masked hopefully remember 2 months last lockdown felt like eternity (Tiger King, toilet paper, etc.) wanna repeat shit. Joe exotic fucking menace Carol trying right! What's going happen colleges?

Like bet Ivies going keep tickin': endowments, reputation, donors. 

But state schools? Community colleges? survive? rate, COVID might stick around next school year too... Oh 100%. censorship awful. even political censorship, censorship basic facts like Sweden’s currently low death rate knows running independent would split Democratic vote give Oompa Loompa hands win. 

If anything needs tickling BALLotS needs them. 

In two party system, unfortunately less people want tolerable. could give Bernie got hosed '16, gets knows butt hurt allow things get even worse  Yeah, definitely going help whole ""conditioning"" conspiracy. it. knowingly MS compromised immune system, yet somehow thought ok go ahead get pregnant pandemic??!! expects us still mask even vaccine continue living dystopian limbo sake? happening. point people going take personal responsibility health well make smarter decisions. Yea imagine leading overloading hospitals pretty quickly Love it!!! Time move Cuomo liked packing em nursing homes well new cases per capita California trending ahead Texas people don’t die single cause, usually combination things. People don’t generally die pneumonia, die COPD pneumonia cancer pneumonia, heart failure pneumonia. means people it. 

If test 100 people find 1 patient well 1%, one person infect whoever encounter. 30 100 sick... consider exponential growth come these. right 200k dead totally fun normal One guy demanded take off

😮 !!! sucks. See /r/covid19positive

Personally think potential permanent loss/warping taste smell much prevalent Quality Life changing covered (not mentioned article ex). end smelling rotten/burning smells random times eating/drinking random foods (that taste mild wrong). Losing 2 5 senses pretty frightening. Hoping vax shot soon. Food Stores recently started building “pandemic pallets” cleaning sanitizing products always inventory food sellers stockpiling months, rather weeks, worth staples pasta sauce paper products better prepare winter, people expected hunker home.

This seems logical. hope flour yeast list too. I'm regular baker finding flour yeast iffy products cleaning wipes canned vegetables remain hard stores obtain, partly continued high demand manufacturers still trying keep up.

Haven't seen Clorox wipes since Foods Corp. HRL 1.16% CEO Jim Snee said recent conference call company 24% less inventory year ago. bacon, pepperoni, Skippy peanut butter SPAM canned meat could run short Covid-19 cases among workers interrupt production again, Mills Inc.

CPB 1.60% ’s overall inventory halfway recovered, team pushing hard fully catch January, according CEO Mark Clouse. racing get Chunky condensed soups Swanson broths back stock adding production capacity snacks Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers Cape Cod potato chips.

Huh. cleaning supplies, trouble buying anything needed months. May last time shelves seemed empty-ish. U.S. v Lopez
U.S. v Morrison

Also, fucking Bill Rights.

Here two articles explaining constitutional, seems like hard time grasping since asking back jurisprudence, I'll ask you. Show Supreme Court case Federal Government given police powers state. Oh, can't!?!  Oh yeah found quick took couple tries. don’t want dead tired newborn worry that. Maybe stock again. nearly double population. texas also 770k Popular misconception.  ain't God.  Likely order 6 months many restrictions. Fauci said previously believes get back unmasked mass indoor gatherings (he referring specifically packed house unmasked Broadway) Q3, maybe Q4 2021 — potential superspreader events like permissible then, it’s extremely likely stringent restrictions relaxed well then. joke beginning pandemic everyone else asked physical distancing less social, Swedes asked keep Swedes.

Joking aside, Sweden physical distancing part culture. everyone naturally, probably need masks measures. Given cannot, still need masks measures. possible store clerk read vaccination info (using handheld device) stored chip implanted person (one time installation upon getting first vaccine shot) . might even install device touch get store. remains seen convenient, guess latter. 97.2% survival rate America. Calm Karen. worried, fine. Stay fuck home. Nobody forcing go out. Reported breaking subs rules keeping information high quality. read part accesiible behind paywall,so first 2 sentences basically. yes, misread/misinterpreted short part accessible. Tell understanding. reason believe long term effects common? Hm. German version 15 million months ago. British fool asked show one functioning covid app.

I really understand guys behave way weird times know what, fuck it. Let happen. sensible, rational people continue safe collective gene pool IQ shoot 37 points.  No, I'm New Orleans. I've probably spent time bars people.


If pandemic, I'd advocating allowing bars across world able set whatever hours want, day week. Sell drinks go. Drive windows. Let's see. dad house foreclosed bank got kicked house 30 years, mom massive amounts medical debt health issues throughout life, niece nephews statistically higher chance profiled killed police sister decided date person color, president appoint Supreme Court Judge record saying she'd like reverse Rowe v Wade, 200k people dead covid politicians charge concerned economy human lives, etc etc etc.

But sure, ""freedom"". 100% right. reason firms do/did lean capital efficient. literal pile physical inventory costly logistics headache. Cheaper easier except force majeure sized proverbial sh*t hits fan? managers take bet. hilarious. I’m sure Plato Aristotle thought good life eliminating risk covid-19 much possible cost whatsoever. even 80 year old epidemiologists like Fauci think otherwise. People eventually need risk/reward calculus act accordingly. Perhaps means 85 year old diabetics avoid college campuses wear masks/protective glasses everywhere.

As perfectly healthy person early 30s apparently already covid asymptomatically, knee jerk response invite good doctor go something really vulgar himself. Unlike 99% millennials apparently, curiosity actually look underlying data. generally know risk (or lack thereof) posed coronavirus compares cost living forever dystopian nightmare. Get *fuck* here.

I’m sure means well patience worn pretty thin point That's interesting thought process one would led decimation humans ever chance get started. hurtling towards destruction based exact thought process. However, blame think somehow worse anyone else. never taught empathy, consideration, given historical context develop opinions. Otherwise, never would come conclusion.

When human beings first started out, formed communities depended survival. member community part either kicked community community decimated. example, skilled farmer decided one day decided longer responsible anyone else community would suffered greatly, would either directly contributed deaths others kicked out. 

When people play part consideration empathy create society like today poisoned resources, dropped nuclear bombs killing innocent people, polluted air breathe, stole along countless decisions decimated populations people care others. 

If work together longer here. debatable otherwise carbon emissions contributing changing climate way normally takes millions years. going set record create hothouse Earth hunred years time. 

I hope someday change mind. restaurants businesses? don’t understand point. unclear exactly many New Yorkers suffer long-term post-COVID-19 symptoms, picture long-haul population looks like starting come view. According McCarthy, “20 50 [years old] range we’re commonly seeing Center. Thirties 40s, even so. it’s mostly formerly healthy alarming post-COVID-19 symptoms reported brain fog fatigue intense people longer able work, often leaving financial emotional distress. spoke Gothamist brain fog said difficulty focusing, struggled engage complex material would forget common words. mean ‘all precautions’, covid came broke house? know. live alone, talk one, triggers badly impulsive states, mean ONE life, trust big loss. Ugh. type shit need happening w/ right wing conspiracy nutjobs social media megaphones. 

Ffs say wear masks social distance. really much point except protect selves, point fingers dumbasses bellow guffaws. immune reason, reasonable people fed trying.  actively testing hypothesis Wisconsin:  


1.  

3. Knock knock.

....Who's there???

Covid.

Ba dum tsssss Every human either you. Reddit safe space precisely it’s left leaning call anyone different opinion Russian. if? Perhaps learn bit TB. You’re delusional. Yes, please catch Covid six feet noisy wave preceded it. one hardcore introvert another- shut up, youre irritating, get hell yourself.  Obviously people want live like one friends family get sick die. Tbh it’s rude selfish behavior. hope insurance companies buying data profiles little regard health health others. envision one getting sick disregarding health authorities subsequently insurer saying brought yourself—you play pay. death traced back certain person (coupled online social life showing partaying insta wanton abandon) sued someone’s untimely death. googled couple Midwestern states random. Wisconsin that’s state article primarily referring to, couple others give context. getting active case stats data? states show contrast say California see quickly resolving them?  choose states list Basically hit 30% test positive rate comes gonna horrendous load people “JEEZUZ CAME BACK DEAD TOO! Zombies God’s people, can’t killing them!” shows really don’t care much underdeveloped world. 

There endless examples. 100 people die earthquake 3rd world country might get quick mention news. 10 people die earthquake developed country dominates news cycle. BTW, think fact he’s telling people stay vigilant right follow Florida’s lead decent evidence show he’s telling truth he’s saying whatever Trump wants to. Never worked retail food service help desk remote support. Amazing many people want let loose others, things control. seen Clorox wipes months, think whole toilet paper thing overblown. last role late March managed find some. stores restocked pretty soon. Wuhan gone back non-masked full normal incredible public health system 100% civilian cooperation. People held homes force, government workers delivering everyone's groceries following strict safety protocols. shit beat it. opinion, can't call greatest country earth countries beaten virus effectively. one public policy decision control over. need honest pros cons lockdowns. pro significantly slow virus’s spread. con towns like destroyed economically.

If think that’s worthy trade-off, that’s fine. need acknowledge we’re making trade-offs. 'God's waiting room' express service. I'm glad... Basically weeding herd. Finally morons get die gene pool gets chorine 😈 Edit:*whooooosh* right head, didn’t see /s

Can provide example occurring? smoking. know what? go it. cram bars. point year, longer care. ill stop seeing tragedy see culling stupid selfish resources freed up. went 3% percent went 5% percent way get around WSJ paywall Google headline. it’ll still show pop-up, click X close it.

headline is: Grocers Stockpile, Build ‘Pandemic Pallets’ Ahead Winter already explained, pay attention. Long term strategy Taiwan doing, many MANY years already 
 That's explanation, that's moving goalpost. Explain Sweden's strategy long term strategy. deflections time. 
 
That explanation. 
Sweden's strategy long term precisely differs Taiwan (oh, additional reason whatever Sweden working well strategies). 
Taiwan already extensive history combating coronaviruses cold viruses, due proximity dominant hotbed diseases China. 
 Latvia bests Sweden every single metric. look age cohorts 
 Yeah, bunch different factors mostly inheritad countries start rather different strategies. 
 
The opening game always part overall strategy. 
But opening game explain differences performance Sweden countries. 
 said before, life expectency already poor making far less % people high risk groups dying corona. Almost 80% people died corona Sweden +80 years old. That's literally 5 years average life expectency Latvia. 
 
You still denying life expectancy reflects overall health resilience elderly, thus also impacting resistance Covid. 
 want look success stories look countries like Norway Finland. Similar life expectency Sweden. 
 
And Sweden still woefully subpar. 
 baltic countries already poor life expectencies poorly handled diseases societies already. mean Estonia Latvia literally aids capitals Europe. 
 
HIV resistance gene peaks among ethnic estonians, likely due plague epidemics arrived 4500 years ago. Fuckin wonderful. Glad live outstanding job achieving herd mentality. understand need emphasize need empathy, people sense ""over covid"" hearing it. 

In short hard headed go feel. 

So old saying goes ""the harder head, harder bat"" allow nature take course people dumb enough go need pay consequences. 

In short empathy limit, mine end. let go get sick let die, Ill clock timing first cases coming first waves casketts result. 

It is. yes no. epidemiologists typically recommend buy little extra every time shop, rather buying bunch once, want extra hand, surges buying counter-productive (because overstress system). would silver could agree him. Many people poorer countries simply can't work home. vouch, conditioned Foxnews watcher. opinion mentioned. Oh no. sure hope none get virus 99.997% survival rate (CDC numbers released days ago) FWIW, Florida active cases moment California. difference animals eat farmed there’s shortage them. Sharks important ecosystems abs killing disrupt ecosystem cause problems. Exactly. need able honest pro/con conversations lockdowns public health policy. con governments closing schools poor areas weak labor laws. Anyone wants help ex-criminal fees situation donate hopefully counteract least - thread Florida discussing DeSantis complete disregard proper pandemic response. Also you’re looking deaths per million California substantially better Florida. New York one states hit hardest beginning, hospitals quickly overwhelmed didn’t know much virus, course would expect death rate reflect that. Nobody wants total lockdown like March, effects clear rather infections possible controlled targeted measures.

But seriously, I'm sick tired hearing death rate death rate that. Stop concentrating only, exclusively death rates. every dead person 5 ICU, every 1 ICU, 6-10 hospitalized. Healthcare costs? Trauma? Long lasting debilitating effects ICU? Work-hours lost? healthcare personnel, really work die?

Enough. 8 months. Think one single millimetre surface stop focusing death rates. Seek help, crazy person. fear right form.  happens vaccine herd mutates start again. I’m upset anything, actually :) mean, don’t significant definitely think allowed see friends family whatever. main point able close contact love most. 

I distance thing felt right thing time. still it, well, commend you, hate think long could go choose pandemic ends. hard time swallowing playing rules basically nothing. numbers worse ever, I’m really wondering initial quarantine continuing quarantine actually anything. 

I’d real hard time alone miserable quarantine bars restaurants full swing colleges wide open spreading covid like wild fire. Seeing close friend negligible point. Basically, community jackshit, I’m willing sacrifice much. mean I've puked anxiety athlete would argue ""unreasonable"" claim. 

Puking anxiety actually common. Far people need mental health resources getting start community fighting access it. 

Much love.  so, upset reaction story itself?  I'll take snarky stupid day DeSantis: way Real talk: restock winter? It’s still hard find Clorox wipes finding papertowels, TP, canned foods back late March insanely difficult (we’d stocked early March). baby way I’m considering stocking limit going out. Covid hoax.

I'm seriously still ZERO options. Okay isn’t Australia likeWAY BIGGER. fl. Lol painfully easy predict we'll see 4 weeks.

DeSantis dumb, fat ass thrown prison.   ~~weird~~ sane thread.

FTFY think deathsantis aka mini-trump shut election can't go vote 🙄 Lockdown preventative *minimise* risk contraction. people getting yet? thing stupid herd immunity? Like maybe there’s chance antimaskers lax aholes get sick achieve immunity die. rest society proceed proper functioning stupid achieved immunity subset. someone start Darwin awards? We’ve got huge turn finals year. fire year old explanation correlation equal causation, exactly did.  don't, perhaps say, anyone two working brain cells want border open time soon. Strange things afoot Circle K Herd immunity, exists novel coronavirus without mass simultaneous vaccination, mean one ignore mitigation (PPE, small gatherings). Especially something airborne. much information beginning pandemic. time thought virus primarily surface spread, hand washing important mask not. know opposite. also know back whether physical distancing going work, know much spread droplets vs airborne. Testing scarce slow Wuhan doctors use CTs diagnose patients. Wuhan lockdown prevented spread rest China, brought time ramp testing capacity build contact tracing program. 

If look progress Chinese clusters, Wuhan January massive lockdowns testing/contact tracing, Beijing May targeted lockdowns (only neighborhoods), city wide testing contact tracing, Qingdao September lockdowns targeted testing/contact tracing. trend toward less lockdown precision, knowledge capability exist early pandemic.

In many ways got lucky, virus turned primarily droplets rarely airborne, otherwise physical distancing fabric masks would worked. People turned infectious 8-9 days symptoms onset, time ended hospitalized past peak contagious relatively healthcare workers died, hospitals collapse. things know back decided lockdown. grandma even acknowledge birthday like post Facebook. maybe told going move middle pandemic thought should? Idk upvote. Anyone praises NY job needs reference death totals. Until
Their nose gets cold. anyone really surprised this? Disgusted sure. least bit surprised. Reading comment gives lot hope.

What’s tough mentally fact it’s unknown.

When get back pre-Covid lives? Back March thought we’d good.

Yeah, way lol

Now thought somewhat least manageable sometime next year puts huge weight shoulders reason.

Ok idk even made sense. interesting. would take account people manic-depressive symptoms exacerbated this. 

(Edit: finger-slip exclamation mark made point little forcefully.) Prove Well, ya know Canada 11th world worst Corona mortalities, U.S. 41st seem saying want people never stop wearing masks. really mean? Touch weiner wish luck friend. Colorado put ban 18-22 year olds CU BOULDER stop partying, CSU college Colorado springs quarantine 2 dorms waste water (had discover poo/pee water) cases rising. insane. think cases rising fast well. wish us luck. right still excuse wear one. I'm confused people dumb middle pandemic. someone explain why? lot subs want original link, shit I’ve gotten pissy messages amp links course, everyone else that's trolling wrong except you. brain work like did, reason lost ability critical thought common sense believe I'm told , completely unable think myself...by way anyone seen mask want go go walk get fresh air feel like half people think Corona something bartender serves lime. rhinovirus, read this. Type interferons, really lack them, increasingly looking like play significant role severe infection SARS-CoV-2 manifests.

Type interferon secretion influenced air temperature.

I personally believe also cause greater expected impact wearing masks reducing severity infection wearer. keeping warm air in. think multiply x30 include devastation family members friends. Two friends lost parents. 99.98% ""unaffected"" population. Seems like good reason get enough health, economic, sociologic public policy experts together actually build response considers comprehensive needs society. know, could keep debating extreme approach less bad hang onto year.  think right. holidays, pandemic fatigue, flu going kill quarter million easy. _confirmed_ deaths. 

 course, know lot Republican states reporting numbers reporting try help Trump. So, it'll worse know.  We’re subscription diapers , I’ll probably household items well! realized wrote state.. one box per county. Still incredibly shady guess better states? I'm expert history repeats we'll wait two weeks see COVID spike October 12 Governor say made mistake shut state two weeks time election.

Not American vote tomorrow IT! Sorry, virus real dealt adequately. 

Extroverts blaming people legitimately concerned non personal way virus, blaming *people* making personal, virus.

That's really infuriating. can't nice things. many people live social, physical reality. there's many bad choices outcomes society. True. hard compare. still always see 9/11 something awful happening US. Meth what’s best objectively, sense indignity subject forces greater yourself. 

If virus still spreading stop protecting it’s fair you’re thinking like child, adult. know this...how?

Common...sense. Every virus nothibg leaves nothing future, duh fucking doi. specifically referring Midwest, correct? seven day average US hospitalizations (roughly 29,500) lowest it’s since April time hospitals 60-70% per major healthcare systems.

EDIT: posted articles covid 22x today. don’t think real numbers thing. Good luck! I'm arguing hard contain virus. reality likely continue another year evidence that. arguing, though, even everything went perfectly, wouldn't, lockdown get cases level whereby could contact trace. level movement still needs occur, unless shutting grocery stores emergency services part lockdown mind. still spread occur- doctors nurses get sick virus spread families, still go grocery stores. firefighters policemen spread way. It'd impossible trace. share view here, I'd happy strictly lockdown month meant could actually get control. Unfortunately, wouldn't. viable, least policymakers would tried implementing second lockdown, haven't. dumbfucks US never get together die.

Everywhere go, people act like joke.

I travel country. [what Archive.is never issues them, recall right countries like Norway, Finland, Taiwan, South Korea would toughest ones beat. Lockdown prevent disease killing people protect economy. half million dead beginning January. holidays going kill lot people. freedom wearing mask!! cant tell do!! There’s something kinda ironic thinking government overstepping there’s investigation go corrupt government Yep.  film crew members die screaming COVID That's expected, immunity wanes population, cycle starts beginning, less. Even though 60% infected Manau, initial herd resistance infections surged enough time passed people infected again.

16 confirmed reinfections 33 million though, right? Right? CDC basically hijacked White House. Communication coordination would *the important things* federal government could do. Communication coordination big parts whole point federal government first place. administration consistently sabotaged messaging promoting misinformation, things like diverting data pressuring CDC tamper data make administration look good. undermine public trust medical advice data, also make harder know hell going on. can't get handle disease sabotage ability know even is. That's dirty option rest states refuse help hospitals start overflowing? Well, generally agree early sense responsibility, later sense seeing friends loved ones can't possibly harm community point. agree completely choices.

But, many people like make excuses themselves, convince emotional pain bad get exception. I've know kind excuse used people engage theft cheating loved ones believe personal pain makes special enough exception. really like logic.

However, said, clear anxiety place high sense responsibility, really making exception anyway. disagree choices glad responsible. apostrophe url? I’m 34, high risk, third kid. Right you. get this, I’m hospitalized best. hope stay healthy almost semi-point insinuated masks would've prevented bulk covid deaths. can't even sub, seems like everyone trolling. almost 100% people wearing masks NYC like 3/20 still became epicenter. whole close-everything limit-of-people-in-the-store everyone-stay-home everyone-in-a-mask still became epicenter. reality. someone internet like ""masks would've prevented everything."" OK then.

Also, PPE shortage end?  March. Yes, ramped production. Ford started making masks. Honeywell 3M ramped production..then shortage over...... ready, **and importantly, it’s time.**”

the fuck mean That’s amazing 7 day average positivity US 4.4% (lowest it’s since testing started months ago) deaths lowest they’ve since beginning July. paying spread much obnoxious divisiveness here? one consistently pessimistic sources bad information entire sub. situation (Latam) developing countries extreme handled. Since us heard death stories, care much statistics, war survivor comforted tell millions die every year anyway. disagree? TL;DR  


Lockdown bad, Sweden good fair, it’s going mostly dumb ass tourist. 

Yeah ton dumbasses Florida asshats come town crazy. get tested? Could asymptomatic haven’t tested. regardless, like said, you’ll never know sure lol hasn’t really worked like UK.

Basically let run free, overwhelmed. It’s simple that. Steroid treatment helped hospitals cope, winter phase going bad regardless. Well mean, vaccine ""baloney"", get then? Generally agree. Accuracy matters. headline would easily fixed inserting word ""Former"" front CDC director.

For worth, try click take post Twitter referenced, tweet deleted. gone back checked see deleted really correct headline, that's suspicion. one professor know told child: ""The reason pay send Harvard meet marry someone whose parents able pay send Harvard"" read article? It’s quite possible COVID causes autoimmune response. fact seems spread easily air conditioned refrigerated environments opposed warm similarly enclosed environments similar lack distance people tells temperature probably definitely plays role.

Just look meatpacking plant outbreaks... Wow, really people simply stupid, thanks confirming it. Go grab tinfoil hat. Lmao really is. rude, I’m looking stats, etc. unverified anecdotes - haven’t found good info looking say emails, phone calls, tracking projects. actually involve? always see people reference things worked office imagine constant chain emails ""memos"" phone calls absolutely nothing lol. sorry something answer, genuinely curious office jobs like. hard time seeing business stay open long-term US Okay feels like conspiracy like viewing world sort lense timing seems suspect. MONTH elections pulls shit?

Florida battle-ground/swing state upcoming elections. WELL documented point progressives tend plan to, pandemic, stay vote-by-mail instead person MUCH conservatives. behavior much enforced another huge outbreak happens, decision Governor DeSantis (who already known scumbag far voting integrity goes) surely do.

You couple fact elections (and specifically mailed-in votes) surely contested year large part courts (remember incoming conservative supermajority Supreme Court) get dark rat-fuckery.

TL;DR: DeSantis willing kill innocent people scumbag idiots keep power. willing destroy democracy murder thousands fellow Americans means fucking keep iota power. criminals belong fucking jail. safe explanation.
Sweden's strategy long term precisely differs Taiwan (oh, additional reason whatever Sweden working well strategies).
Taiwan already extensive history combating coronaviruses cold viruses, due proximity dominant hotbed diseases China. 

Jesus fucking christ. EXPLAIN Sweden's strategy along term strategy. Explain parts isn't. Enough nonsene non opening game always part overall opening game explain differences performance Sweden countries. 

No, lot factors combined entire point made. one urbanized countries world, almost 5% Stockholm's population located Northern Italy ground zero outbreak Europe, old average population, last year lowest year relative deaths compared population since records started 300 years ago, failures shitty profit retirement homes, population travels far average person etc. Plenty factors still denying life expectancy reflects overall health resilience elderly, thus also impacting resistance Covid.

We already good idea vulnarable covid. fat people, elderly people people immune lowering diseases. average life expectency men Latvia literally 70 fucking years. deaths caused factors like excessive alcohol intake. shitty liver make much weaker corona Sweden still woefully subpar. 

Yep, never claimed Sweden success story all. pretty clear actual knowledge handled, factors strategies are. want reason justify obvious ill resistance gene peaks among ethnic estonians, likely due plague epidemics arrived 4500 years ago

Makes even amazing high rate cases aids. relevant discussion. Recoveries = statistic highly imperfect, reporting missing, incomplete, incorrect, based different definitions, dated (or combination these) many governments, local national level, sometimes differences states within country counties within state.

Ya, looks like metric highly selective reported IMO something show state (Google example excludes FL). Given Florida's recent cases vs number incubation timelines, guessing report outcome lot cases. Frustrating unexpected place high count little follow up. Think beautiful beachfront properties that’ll sale soon. still worse were. holding steady while, pockets city testing positive 4x higher city overall. think start spreading schools indoor dining resume? Oh please broward :( mom kids back class two weeks I'm already terrified. kids 5, two kids per table (not 6 feet apart), plexiglass allowed, considered high risk. Really hate living Florida :( Lucky stores adopted online ordering curbside pick up. Personally, can't wait feel someone's hard cock line again. Wait....what?  OK, disingenuous act like that's way things NYC. live NY know doctor offices covid tests first week April, we've 70K-80K tests per day rapid tests places. Actually, think it, borderline lying test (unless live far reaches Adirondacks something). NYC 700 testing sites one point practically recruiting people get tested. people get multiple tests nature work. Stop trying create false narrative testing hard come by. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article *Everybody* wants make money. make smart move. I’m hoping you’re referring solely social distancing policies (and even that’s iffy) viral spread, healthcare policies prevent people dying... that’s assessment, Gov. Cuomo thousands dead nursing home residents would like word. Plus side: able buy ocean front, Florida home discount soon. many people time period died heart disease, cancer, diabetes2, MS, stroke, etc. etc. etc? real reason even know CoViD-19 big deal overwhelms hospitals, medical doctors decide important isn't. Since can't get handle heart disease, cancer, diabetes2, MS, stroke, etc., pretend exist CoViD-19, real disease kills real people many, becomes eyes medical people really big deal. people think really big deal see health world eyes medical profession. like movie Moon, man need get nature more. stuck big city something? Get town take road trip! could stay campgrounds nice cool out. many relatively safe things require mask wearing, get away people. people spoken COVID cancelled. 6 months next divisive subject hate even more. COVID bad hospitals filled life sort out. Bars stores packed.   Uh ok, best luck there. mean understand science facts? Belief simple minded fools. think majority people going play rules even another year, think going beyond! Vulnerable people need protection, people 50 literally put risk due mental health decline, missing physical health screenings lost jobs reduced hours. brutal. while, vividly remember last half freshman year especially sophomore year. times made friends stuck next couple decades. friendships made parties, late nights studying together, hanging living room dorm. many memories. years started become myself. partner says exactly thing college years. Junior senior years different classes harder need focus more. 

It's really fair you. not. Especially since virus essentially harmless 30. sucks actually really enjoy Florida. There’s something different it. scenery seriously unlike state. find brightly colored houses buildings look different. ain’t America’s asshole terms people. 

Check “the Florida project” sometime, incredible film portrays Florida better form media I’ve ever seen. Willem Defoe great it. Florida took two weeks. Good hear, hope fatigue wear soon, thanks this! tell expect un-blinded? means want miss money, especially holidays coming  

I recently recovered anxiety attack traced cause pretending like pandemic affecting me, since lucky enough employed, sheltered significant other, healthy. However since realised case long list small things could done increase resiliency.

I hope find page helpful, please share widely. wish could resource back June.

If time, please fill survey linked site: answers (absent personal info) shared others worldviews besides narrow perspective represented. people idiots gov Yes real numbers definitely thing. know happens prisons cruise ships. 

If know overshoot means, talk herd immunity either way. ""Simple things"".

You realize people lost jobs. lost friends, lost birthdays, celebrations, parties, lost meeting new people, lost years lives, 18 lockdowns started, I'm gonna 20 lockdowns end. I'm missing freshman year college, missed high school graduation, I'm missing best years life. havent talked friend person since March, family.

So saying ""oh guys wear mask, close people"" really insulting. People lost much wearing mask. Good idea right elections desantis. Thanks. lmao, case point KFF Tracking Poll conducted late March, shortly many stay-at-home orders issued, found 47% sheltering-in-place reported negative mental health effects resulting worry stress related coronavirus (Figure 2). rate significantly higher 37% among people sheltering-in-place reporting negative mental health impacts coronavirus. sheltering-in-place, 21% reported major negative impact mental health stress worry coronavirus, compared 13% sheltering-in-place.

Title little disingenuous. pandemic alone contributes significantly negative impact lockdown does. I'm also curious impact prolonged outbreak healthcare KFF Tracking Poll conducted mid-July, 53% adults United States reported mental health negatively impacted due worry stress coronavirus. significantly higher 32% reported March

For reference, many countries went lockdown already largely reopened then.

Would things better outbreak get bad? Would less negative impact decisive quick lockdown seen countries? Enjoy covid fact stopped elective surgeries makes angry (edit: throw fact preemptive screenings checkups way way scared people away visiting hospitals). Idc it’s unpopular opinion. It’s massive mistake. :( asking whether Covid vaccines expected protect common cold coronaviruses? Given 1) common colds big public concern 2) 10% common colds caused coronaviruses 3) research showing prior infections common cold coronavirus protect Covid, reverse would also probably work, think anyone going studying it. 1 done 7799 go.

Reddit covid: cmon bro it’s 18 months. Suck up. It’s like you’re dying. anti vaxxer, offering word caution upcoming COVID vaccine.  hope everyone understands extremely dangerous release new vaccine new disease without 10 15 years trials research. fact is, vaccine trillion dollar prize first big pharma company pumps seemingly safe version. rush prize likely cause people cut corners even probably cover things up. dont even wait see that's true. already happening. Astra-Zeneca already whistleblowers coming forward stating many vaccine test subjects developed serious neurological disorders ranging M.S. ryeloid myelitis. 

So maybe people arent trusting you. Maybe crowd referring little cautious comes things like this. people missing points. either argumentative argumentative think way living life correct way. must replied wrong comment talking postponed elections. Let's see... 

A million dead worldwide, 200k+ US

Multiple friends permanent health damage

Local ICU full,

Weeks away tens millions losing healthcare

Employees told work without mask quit denied unemployment

Democracy crumbling

...and Trump's official Covid spokesperson acknowledge virus airborne, instead tells ""Trump Army"" buy ammo civil war election day.

But sure, people depressed lockdowns. family lives Utah. majority people don’t care think it’s big deal. holding concerts Tuacahn thousands people attending, face masks optional social distancing. That’s date. 14 days slow spread. weara mask help others. we’re 6 months pressure wear mask higher ever. 

When enough? Give date I’m in. saying government open ended power ever ( force wear something everywhere go wasn’t even thing 12 months ago) okay. fun least? like ur guaranteed covid cautious time around comes 0.7%. sure looking at. pandemic officially highjacked sinister interests. takes 76 day lockdown completely eliminate covid. eliminate covid go back normal, masks, social distancing, disease gone go back normal. depressing people, shame. Long term measures, wtf? People social needs whole point solution go back normal.

Look Wuhan, pool party attended 30,000 zero mask usage ZERO social distancing. single infection eliminated virus back February. disease eliminated 2 half months, 76 days strong measures go back NORMAL, long term restrictions kind. rude. 

Other people allowed live lives. extra careful, sounds like be.

Edit: also, gave birth June 5th twins. high risk pregnancy worst pandemic. get scary. still expect anyone change lives me. say anything millions overseas hkers? I'm talking people travellers visit HK. work job leanification inventory never made sense caused chronic problems added expense... no, none needs perishable goods. long lead time items made specifically us, never made sense.

It applied broadly little wiggle room obvious set catastrophic failure *many* industries. welcome inevitable pullback reassessment open arms. Hopefully learn chronic workplace headaches finally fixed. Young people giving greatest years lives help save people worst years lives. Like end restrictions end next fall, people missed entire year half lives really anything.

You cant form relationships, cant go out, cant fun. 18 lockdowns started, I'm going 20 lockdowns end, colleges open back up. I'm going miss rest teenage years, I'm already missing freshman year college, I'm missing connections college may lead jobs, I'm missing friendships... Lol, gonna continue forever, that's many people saying restrictions lifted right beginning, means correct right start, what's point restrictions/distancing delaying inevitable? lift restrictions reopen completely then. go grocery store, buy double nonperishables. normally buy two cans beans, buy four. Stash extras away back pantry. buy stuff normally use. way shortages lose job, got nice emergency stash. nothing particularly bad happens, always use things bought.  Doublethink finest.  Hand hamster least state, chokers past 3 months Half first year likely whole second year college hijacked virus. It’s definitely taken toll mental health. definitely widely available next summer earliest. couple vaccines pause trials due reactions. Biden 100% talking wanting rushed vaccine. safety &amp; everything properly. Use Google fact check next time. hard. Long term effects knowledge common. Almost every person completely recover. make virus serious. think acting like 20% people get coronavirus going permanent long term health issues makes us look silly gives ammo people take pandemic seriously ""what else could exaggerating?"" 3 things required survival?

Now, we've blown past 200K full steam towards 300K beer hands. I've seen least one post positing may intentional throw uncertainty concern election situation November. post stated:

 last couple days, DeSantis issued orders opening businesses full Capacity mask requirements.  two things.  us protest idiocy thing, we’re still pandemic. polarizing right left, leading election.  much nefarious angle, opening things back right gives weeks transmission Covid increase, announcing new spike, right person early voting commences.  spike depress person voting, give enough time request absentee ballots, favor current president.  Rick Scott put together legislation prohibiting counting votes actual Election Day, limiting said count 24 hours Election Day. tabulating votes obtained that, suppressing mail votes. Florida like people walled tower beginning Land Dead, they're like, zombies can't get here...and know zombies damn well gonna get there. thanks easy. California, city dumped sand skatepark kids couldn’t use it. Dumbest thing I’ve ever seen, soooo unnecessary. people wearing stuff? I've seen it. one suggestion made one person lol seem placing sources HK's imported cases mainland. Scientists already proven traces covid19 originated elsewhere, Taiwan cases even though shut borders HK did. Stop trying turn everything conspiracy. HK already chaos, inevitably unpredictability virus simply brought chaos. That’s good YOU. wear mask forever care. Doesn’t mean everyone else going feel self conscious want stay inside forever. making imaginary people fights act disappointed appear? Get outta nonsense. can't name source part alien government waiting humanity weakened virus watching pornography Dont Milk vit D? Nice That's deaths work though

Suppose person aged 40 obesity contracts COVID. Without COVID, he'd live another 20 even 30 years. COVID, died. That's death toll is

you guys fucking idiots. China played role shaping narrative pro-lockdown 

Why Earth would that? silliest conspiracy theory yet.

China invent quarantine. Ancient people practiced quarantine. bible. works, people cooperate. work us U.S. everybody special inconvenienced national crisis. blame China that. ridiculous. Look mirror, responsible failures. good problem. US victims fucked.. Really reducing covid spread means even bigger load future medicaid spending number severely disabled increases. Ron DeSuck-ass Nearly every person contracts Coronavirus survives. don’t lock flu kills people. hurt vastly higher numbers people shutting economy virus did. identify who’s vulnerable. Ironically it’s almost exact people flu would kill well. 

I know that’s going unpopular opinion it’s fact. Someone going throw 200,000 number millions recovered. Shutting people’s lives something isn’t dangerous nearly every person catches absurd. don’t shut transportation even though kills people. lost 2 cousins car accidents I’m parading get everyone stop driving cars know likely going kill people. like Coronavirus. feel danger self quarantine wear PPE. 

Let negs possible ban begin. apologize honesty people won’t like. 

FYI America likely survive Coronavirus anywhere else world. 97.1% likelihood generally healthy number much higher. I'm also worried what's going happen people finding love, mean, bars closed, colleges closed, parties outlawed, stay 6 feet apart, ways finding someone closed pretty much. Right way find someone online dating. dub thee governor death sentence. know what's funny redditors military, relate care Yeah I've wanted call people wearing masks wearing correctly, worth it. likely non wearers unhinged Texas there's good chanced they're packing heat. ""We need money"" fine line much inventory keep relation warehouse space cost building. throw food expiry dates, another factor. used calculations inventory control formulas make go crazy. say toilet paper, manufacturing also acquiring raw materials make supplier probably can't improve production. plenty go around, hoarders mess system. consolidates directly states Covid 19 Tracking Project agree, wish species sync must protect other. actually read wrote? literally two sentences, difficult.

I explicitly addressed that. I'm legitimately struggling see explain simply did. two sentences, even like buried there. good arguments. disagree you. sure many scenarios quarantine poses high barrier people overseas return vote. HK government justified postponement.

I know that's top concern, think countries start universal covid testing, bring covid infections. side effect quickening pace HK election ultimately. also well good. think people know positive impact HK's universal testing. possible save economy lives.

That's true, needs proper leadership *and* functioning society achieve that. New Zealand Finland lockdowns 2 months everything largely reopened group size limits 50-100. Singapore Malaysia one 3 months reopening schools. South Korea saw first case day US, schools reopened since May.

The lack coordinated plan everything delayed officials keep saying UNsAFe matter numbers show.

At point US ever safe numbers? Maybe, barely, week two June, happened numbers gone corona thats point care deaths deaths gone lot.

They actually gone lot. still seeing high triple digit deaths many days. California red lot areas. Exact thing happening Missouri. damn frustrating. Many people acting like back normal. That’s true all. grew watching JAG, officer enlisted definitely walk hallway talk, sit together lunch, bunk together.

Trump maffiosos leaning every one make dear leader look bad. 

Safe assume every agency partially captured. Right, symptoms subsided now, including mild fever last night. Tylenol good night's sleep helped bunch. Well cold virus. Pretty sure positive rate hundreds cold viruses circulate even higher. Wisconsin either. Minnesota, outside urban areas little mask use despite statewide mask order. Lockdowns ended months ago. crazy media certainly sensationalizes deaths younger people (and that's typical young death) they're still exceedingly rare. According CDC death statistics US much higher risk dying cancer, heart disease, diabetes, car accident, stroke, self harm etc. going ban cars? sugary fatty foods? cleaning products? going legislate people's diet exercise regiment? sounds crazy is. People assess make decisions personal risk without forcing others along ride.
Source: virus There’s repercussions.

Maybe *legal* repercussions. I've heard there's nasty respiratory virus going around that's really *quite* contagious, donchaknow! party current US president belongs to. stands Grand Old Party. That's big part this. States reporting deaths ailments occurred result coronavirus complications, like pneumonia, coronavirus death. mention schools agricultural communities, sending child school means loss labour family old fucks leave northern part country Florida winter subreddit hilarious posted another sub got attacked mom's retired microbiologist one big pharma peeps. bunch different vaccine trails, hell even genome project. fucking scared much politics wrapped vaccine get first round. way rushed sorta smart political pumping dumping troubling. process science politicized got grant from.

And people audacity say need mask vaccine. Parliament's bars exempt lot licensing laws, particularly Weight &amp; Measures Act. 

Something made great use last time invited parliament. also LOT free alcohol served there. would estimate drunk around £1700 worth paid penny. Lmao. symptoms far real, pretty mild. think fever last night took tylenol fever symptoms subsided now. Bed rest helped lot. exhausting. 7 months fighting current. fatigue real.. work there? made realize absolutely leave country. want family refuse raise kids here. Angry people wearing masks going that’s keeping pandemic dragging months. friends Germany cramming bars summer know schools back European countries since May (with distancing countries except Sweden). social distance entire summer hugged many friends. got tested negative (I'm Toronto)
To me, data suggests hiding destroying economy that's slowing virus, natural cycles Earth. Yup!

The large metropolitan centres also play host commercial property owners, large donors Tory party.

It’s brazen corruption. bad Titanic, amirite? lot people ditching masks Florida. I'm seeing people without line grocery store, gas station, etc.. past weekend. Hillsborough county fwiw. 

Half wearing nose anyway. There's also stupid beaded masks pointless, fabric filter, one big bead bracelet like cover. FLorons.

I'm really surprised Floridians beating people's ass show without mask rather avoid argue life/death safety protocols. run dude hanging wall window Panera bread table mask. One worst things covid realization people general smart calculated thought. worst thick saw people basically risking lives ridiculous wants, fountain coke, frozen burrito, etc. Yeah kidding.

I personally feel vaccine lowers risk catching virus lowers severity symptoms, masks social distancing need go. Even whole population hasn’t gotten vaccine. I’m protected that’s matter. Others protect taking vaccine continuing mask/social distance. I’m public health measures get vaccine then, what’s point getting vaccine? always self-isolate want take chances. 

Asking 99% world population keep social distancing wearing masks \*after\* vaccine 1% cannot take vaccine due health issues reasonable. Bus journey ￼- March 9 report - bad follow Taiwan Korea Australia New Zealand Thailand Vietnam etc. policies. deep.

I teach fancy liberal arts college (it generally considered safety school get little ivy's) biggest difference cover basic stuff. students could write well could. gave statistics exam used 2 years big state university average always high C. Every kid class liberal arts school made high it. university I'm now, actually cover order operations multiply negative numbers. really changes teach speed depth cover things.

When taught state flagship, again, cover basics. examples examples. level class discussion much higher. Students would integrate things learned read make great points, ask really tough questions. largely get blank stares followed going test?

No outbreak lol. 

You stay fuck state. don’t want here. easy answer one wants hear it.  never real lockdown 200k+ dead millions infected.  something soon country much risk total collapse. Tickle scrote I'm interested know I'm educated vaccines!

So history I've get rabies vaccine antibodies/antigen/whatev. 

If vaccines effective enough prevent infection, what's point rabies vaccine, tuberculosis vaccine etc? 

And can't walk around covid people got vaccine? immune dying covid anyway? I'm understanding. really trying rebel anything, know I'm hoping someone information could please inform me. must mean 30% increase cause would really difficult go 6% 30% one week, like believe dashboard showing Insanely so.

I'm sure ebbs flows different regions depending severity.

If lockdown, see refrigerated trucks across street house, easy upset able go work, real divide disparity hard different groups hit.

In FL, instance, unemployment $275 12 weeks that's it. majority people applying saw nothing month, governor said system intentionally designed make sure one could get paid.

Add HUGE portion people contracted health insurance, unemployment eligibility whatsoever... excludes many federal benefits since functional system properly apply.

So... THINK lockdown would good thing.

Except virus care anyone thinks, turns one infected places earth ideal economy based almost entirely tourism.

All MIGHT manageable, real dealbreaker utter lack leadership misinformation top resulted many businesses FL actually banning masks employees recourse, worker's comp remedy, many cases, insurance.  law says school start did.

Don't reply. boring.
If want communicate, nothing say.

What talking communicating?boring seeing big spikes area honestly. still ways herd iummunity, large chunk infected likely slow bit. big concern cold areas hit hard yet, especially taking precautions. midwest primed pain. saw New Zealand eradicated virus, everybody strange idea mind virus eradicated. lots factors New Zealand’s eradication virus simply can’t occur countries, like island nation, low population density, strong response people, etc.. point, strong compliance impossible do, due negative side effects lockdown, lockdown virus fatigue, people hating idea wearing mask. Yes give attention. women either understand viral evolution genuinely thinks made lab resembles SARS viruses, understand viral evolution works ulterior motive lying designed.

I looked already soon sequence lab involved making one vaccines COVID-19. Looking sequence SARS-CoV2 comparing known coronavirus sequences evidence manipulated. would designed infect humans, one would assume part needed tissue tropism humans would taken coronaviruses infect humans increase chance could infect humans. there. closely resembles bat coronaviruses. also molecular scar anywhere virus points deliberate manipulation, introduced unique restriction site easy cloning multiple variants background (which lab), even though really proof removed, seamless cloning days norm. 

Also, virologists molecular biologists warning world decades exactly would (not could!) happen, bats would likely origin hosts, process would sped allowing packed animal markets china continue operate without shielding animals other. 

Bottom line. origin SARS-CoV2 mystery. evolved expected would. evidence designed. % chart, raw fraction - multiply 100 get percent.. 5.4% 70+, 0.03% 1-19. There's surprising number COVID deniers comments, even 200k Americans died enter second peak.

Hard imagine isnt least partially coordinated political/bot campaign. *laughs even harder Vietnam* problem ONE company much. production never able match demands, funding go also other, smaller, companies infrastructure already set need upfront money retooling/supplies/assured sales.

Before corona, N95 mainly sold construction industry... much smaller numbers. Thank you! florida may improve due people able outside.  heat drove air conditioned buildings helped spread virus. ever florida unbearable summer. 90% humidity 90+ degrees.

that lessen fall/winter months.

what concerned snowbirds area going there, getting covid spreading among locals bringing back here. billboard say? Come play, come play, forget movement. Honestly, politics making worse. handle pandemic, chaos making burden. It’s sad. Poor people get poorer. rich gets even richer. Life fair. poor cannot access necessities deserve. rich access necessities even hoard like treasure cave. billionaires money? compete pointless ironic war numbers ‘who’s richer’ competitions? wouldn’t worry yet,there 90,000 articles released one authors credited work this, keep mind Yes, would believe large outbreaks. take virus seriously all. complete eradication, like report, realistic. huge country, many huge cities diverse peoples living it. matter hard try there's always weak link reservoir virus lurking somewhere.

I imagine reality regularly small outbreaks different cities quickly contained reported chain command local CCP official. reported higher ups. 100 cases city easily become 0 state controls news.

 kind lying local party officials (e.g. reporting harvests, economic output) please superiors always feature CCP people live flock across boarder stuff state, it’s going affect too. Great... buncha pussies Yes is. Testing: need start WW3 China. Now. summer spread much contagious common cold.

the r0 dropped, high normally, enough naturally fade away like cold/flu year.

I've trying warn folks this. lots studies showing humidity massive factor transmission, fall/wintee going drive ground. cant compared country like swedish 27 people/km2 country like France 117 people/km2. Paris double density Stockholm (and France least 5-6 supercity like unlike swedish). lot Americans. number us right thing hate maskholes perpetuate disease. Disabled veterans. % disabled determines amount exempt from. Many states similar laws. foolish attitude take. fewer people take vaccine, lower effectiveness. due [herd Yeah way go back work rich slightly less poor maybe get sick. Yeah...I’m gonna keep staying home. Thank sharing this. Thankyou sir 🥺 Yes thankyou kind hooman ^.^ really sucks us Americans right give shit, everywhere look people packing restaurants wearing mask noses, wearing one all. wish collectively weren’t jerks right thing. honestly think president responded completely differently begin lot idiots would things differently, would alternate universe president happen. worldometers deaths ~6 per day WI weeks. could h3n2 (avian flu) ran area time covid scared fuck people. 3 us tested negative, 2 swabs, antibody. identical symptoms. horrid cough, sharp fever one day, low/no fever rest time.

what sucked people getting covid around virtually fever too, made us think thing. tip loss smell/taste covid folks acute cases that. ended killing 2 family members roommate's coworkers.

honestly potential long term effects covid, would preferred flu strain hit us. First father got fever got sore throat thought normal cold
So took meds doctor didnt helped 3 days mt father got tested positive mild father little severe isn’t voter base? 

Maybe best strategy could go with... I’m Vermont originally elderly parents nestled safely mountains Canadian border thankfully. worry Wisconsin. It’s like completely different countries handled. Lockdown are/were Logic evolution towards pandemic considering unprepared west was. saying arent wrong. puts Spain Belgium major European states death tolls per million ahead US. (There also micro states Andorra San Marino, total 95 deaths 110,000 population them). Schools formed give parents free baby sitting service.

wtf talking about? Women mostly homemakers/stay home mothers 30-40 years ago. motto times. Correct, they're definitely higher [unreported indirect calculated. trust anything coming official chinese source first reaction CCP doctors alerting public first cases covid lock doctors force retract statements. Remember journalist reported covid desapeared week CCP ? west knows kind behaviour. know CCP wants save face, pretend controle pretend competent.  
I started following covid Wuhan put lockdown. informations lot people considered like SARS MERS : something would come europe US... 
Secondly might played huge role situation : Racism... Trump banned entry chinese citizens, reaction democrats ""go china town, mix people show racists""... 
Nobody wanted say anything fear branded racist over-reacting. people nothing. 
Thirdly, CCP China general extremly dishonest. Overtly stealing intelectual property pretending west makes up... west sees china fake, can't trusted still huge market capitalistic company. trust anything china says, know care copyrights steal IP advance companies economies.  
Lastely, compare... country earth official covid cases except China North-Korea... cases reported CCP foreigners call ""imported cases"". 
 
Westerners idiots, see virus infections evolving country countries. telling us 0 active cases mainland China except foreigners idiotic. 

Countries 100 times smaller china official cases China itself. Anyone 2 brain cells knows ridiculous chinese numbers arecompared everything know virus spread. MIT study... Ok Sponsored Aviation industry. Ok 1% aircraft boarding, deplaning, Security checks anything else. Ok also everything Perfect (like everybody wear masks, many people move, filter work perfect on).

You know what? Yeah Bullshit says. stupid leading stupid. fucking Idea long-terms side effects even asymptomatics. already Saw lung damages.
But yea let's bet something fully know.

See bottom mate causes birth defects? know 9 months. affects two generations line? Yeah, even wear mask situation. 

Americans pretty shitty this. worse France actually. Nobody trusts forms goverment here, ever Trump admin decided herd immunity back April, realized disproportionately affecting killing non-white people.

Now digging even theory, even point sacrificing base.

The darkness moment probably gonna take time understand. Illinois person Chicago Democratic strong hold leave city limits rest Illinois totally Trump rabid supporters. went Holland day worky work. one wearing mask. felt surreal. part locking first month

This remotely true lie. high school Katrina hit. went school children displaced Katrina. majority far behind us. learning things learned junior high high school. Beacuse far behind, school put GED program. think ended dropping out. 

The New Orleans public school district joke. failed students many others. many students enough resources give people far behind help need. Yes I'm taking medicines I'm feeling good right cough reduced isolated myself. suck math pretty sure that's probability works.

In many covid related deaths,the death certificates usually written 'flu' complications.Until one person die near you,you understand serious whole thing is.I one didn't,until happened. Ok psycho private businesses still enforce rules tell leave wearing mask Yet are. Experts (Sweden) say cases likely increase fall/winter people spend time indoors. much easier virus spread indoors, hence amount cases dropping pretty much everywhere summer people spend time outside. whats fucked NJ small town good it, Atlantic city shit show.  Monmouth, Ocean Atlantic county seem think hoax. bumblefuck county people think overblown, want risk it. Agreed. It’s difficult avoid potential hotspots, can’t, simply wear mask. sure it’s big deal. let’s make another Frontier commercial people singing fun home! make things better black death, spanish flu, smallpox, plague Justinian, AIDS, third plague,Antonine plague, 17th century great plagues.

the black death pervasive 3 bacteria 2 ancestor (Justinan Antonine) mean going bar anyway, ideally would, least wear sips. Yep. hospital work run something close 50k tests around 2500 positives. be. hotels managed, nurses specialists site able regularly tested. 

If home cannot control comes goes, families go, virus travel within bubble. 

NZ decimated second wave faster first, less cases less restrictive lockdowns managed isolation. 

If think four five star hotel room service, meals provided free hotel entertainment somehow restriction perceived freedom, maybe consider freedom wider community whole stay safe healthy. Yet according them, GDP still projected increase slightly year! Absurd. evidence numbers anything published CCP generally nonsense. Even 100% support measures, think incredibly disingenuous choice words claim 'the pandemic' causing extreme poverty lockdown policies attempting control pandemic? Yeah, brain precludes one dumbfucks call less testing. close friends Vancouver, ability quarantine, could visit safely.

But even think trying. respect Canada Canadians. foreigners like living totally normal life (apart traveling) covid free months find sort comments hilarious. Yeah testing lot people positive, people wait four days get result (2 days appointment 2 days result). Let's hope get shit together local lockdowns 350k entirely crazy testing capacity already stretched limit taking longer longer get results, claims infections coming Madrid taken enormous grain salt. live island North Atlantic. get blizzards. get tail ends hurricanes winter extra blizzardy. don’t need rebuild homes infrastructure yearly (obvs homes infrastructure). 

If United States climate change could understand continuing build communities paths hurricanes tornados, areas drought (and stupidity) wildfires rampant, areas land sea level... don’t. isn’t even sane social safety net disaster preparedness apparatus place.

It seems like maybe that’s smart. 

But know... live place jobs still financial future pinned oil industry. 🤷‍♂️ Pandemic aside, lot public schools give half ass education. also remember Chinese authorities knew human-to-human transmission witholded WHO... yeah, can't trust anything coming CCP. we're country company. raw numbers, based death rate. black death likely hold record long time. would pay separate cable bill month watch Hannity get punched face repeatedly Oh fuck. going ugly. 😔 r/leopardsatemyface properly, workplace still us work tightly packed cubicles lot people take masks they’re desks. I’m engineer- I’m essential, makes sense. Hit nail head comment. AIDS pandemic list respiratory infection.

you can't get aids simply near infected person, radically different animal. Well yeah.. drink alchohol mask on? know else shocking? People would purposely get infected it. rather they'd make sure kids got infected it. issue Madrid political issue, partisan one.

The PSOE central government weak height crisis, right, including regional government Madrid, decided good opportunity agitate government increase standing. sort worked, central government blinked gave regional govts. authority, backfiring regional government equipped handle surge. won’t individual choices though. least long time. 


If essential worker, could get vaccine Abu Dhabi right now. It’s Sinopharm vaccine. probably places around world people get different Covid-19 vaccines. vaccine eventually approved use USA isn’t one gets quickest, best results vaccine trials. They’re getting one ones invested early process. won’t distribution chain (or political persuasion) access anything ones. 

[It’s little difficult tell right populations countries access vaccines, haven’t set reporting way. communist China, think anyone really get real informations...  Thanks anecdote love. hope nephew gets better. Covid would never happened 1918. best farmer would gotten. Gotten sick. would end pandemic. Lafayette West Lafayette restrictions well, honestly I’ve seen everyone adhere them. Hey Americans, **free Pro tip**

People fucking die unnecessarily! would count AIDS? arbitrary thing do. obvious truth. I’ve there. charming quiet place it’s sad see caught middle border closure dilemma, especially since actually zero covid19 cases exclave. think problem I’ve heard epidemiologists say 75% (or so) population needs vaccine make effective.

To shut outbreaks among unvaccinated can't vaccinated.

It'd much effective *are* vaccinated Would still count survival fittest though 🤷‍♂️ put perspective we'll replaced Wednesday 8pm. is. cares anymore? Oh wow, that’s great news!!! know listen cause it’s people airline speaking listening Conan O'Brien interviewing Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell said Conan, Harvard alum, hiring asks assistant remove identifying features: name, address, college attended, etc. finds irrelevant let's work speak itself. found refreshing. asleep since April? Countless people going beaches, bars, shoulder-to-shoulder protests, every manner crowded gatherings since end May hope whatsoever proving infection came (you know, important part lawsuit called ""evidence"")

The overwhelming majority COVID-19 lawsuits might heard *being infected*, rather insurance, wrongful termination, failure comply regulations (such trying evict tenants temporarily outlawed). Unless someone nursing home proof went *nowhere else* due *gross negligence*, winning lawsuit catch republican states - covering up. look Florida Georgia. Sweden? Uh mean somewhere else. could see Clint Eastwood spreading COVID That's relevant quote, missed that.

""The fact is, vaccine trillion dollar prize first big pharma company pumps seemingly safe version."" One fifty shot course shots versus months meds infectees lifetimes badly impacted.

Central texas here, surprising amount people wear masks now, although never ever even seen mask mandate enforced people everyone South Korea also going get eventually odds exponentially lower country isn’t populated idiots accept failiure? baffles case.

Sorry, comes eating people discriminate poor rich. ""The Harvard study, sponsored aviation industry...""

 misleading imo imo knows normal people think taking flight ""only"" 1% chance less catch virus inside plane. Security check, airport, boarding, deplaning, transport Airport plane (i mean bus) maybe purpose excluded. anyone watch video Chinese whistleblower saying made lab shit 35 upvotes. You’re acting like it’s big thread mods would even care vet. Foxnews made US response pandemic exponentially worse. we'd done right things lockdown would much better position today. come around short time, went hard w sniffles, freedom, etc stuff. 5G? nano-robots? Well, hopefully won’t come triage. DMAT resources freed need due hurricane season. luck, we’ll hopefully able get lead next challenges ahead, knock wood.
Good luck there. You’re* yes right - somehow people able oblige information, point makes little sense.

There’s sort info *what* happens long haulers doesn’t seem like measurement common (even 6 month mark whatever). really don’t think it’s lack studying recovered patients. secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia deadly. Fun fact: deaths 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic actually bacterial pneumonia treating difficult antibiotics discovered/developed yet. It’s really, though. Canadians keep finding entitled Americans want vacation think skirt quarantine regulations 

I’m American who’s living Canada years it’s best decision I’ve ever made, it’s also heartbreaking see country burning outside whole world virus free, common sense.

you wanna get covid. even know wtf rest life. could brain damaged forever. one knows. anticipating kind virtue test get vax? Won’t apportioned need. I’m fully expecting go redder states first. part Big Lie bullshit usual. Hell, bout new 18 (or so) february lasted way August. sure people hording stuff... like hugs. feel shouldn’t laughing mean, cannot hurt. Like morbus crohn even season supply toilet paper aint much.

I also got bottle years supply vitamin supplement (winter going dark anyways indoors wont help), long term canned foor go waste anyways.

I doubt _real_ shortage, knowledge help herd mentality creates artificial storage due people buying years worth shit need. funds research,healthcare instutions,the vaccine campaigns overall infra structure healthcare system?I leave answer you

As seem indolent actually look facts own, shall work you. Healthcare system India funded state union government, Hospitals like AIIMS major research institutes run Union government whereas state government job run local municipal level healthcare workers like ASHA, actually administration.

As funding immunization drives: know lazy ass would want skim best read bothering reply. never said anything existing political stage time,him acting CM time would good even existing.All thing nowadays,Pubilicty stunts.

Spoken like true Randian, according work ever done done Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. fact biased read compare GSDP numbers Gujarat vis-a-vis states national average 2001-14 obvious. love guys love nitpicking.But guess that's Modi fans be,you remind dad honestly.I bet would less angry/upset insulted parents/loved ones.

Nah, would win pathetic opposition can't get act together aid abet spouting lies half-truths. every day, story, different person, one learns. Never considered North Dakota apart Midwest.

It’s always tragic lose someone. goes cancer , Covid , traffic , measles whatever u think of. article:

To explore whether SARS-CoV-2 could invade brain cells, Iwasaki Bilguvar’s group used mouse models, post-mortem brain tissue COVID-19 patients brain organoids –– artificially-grown mini brains.

“I think combination three methods, kind piece together whole picture best possible, especially organ like brain, can’t take samples readily,” Song said.

According Song, three models complemented other. organoids limitation accounting cell types found brain, mouse model physiologically representative. limitation mouse model mice probably react virus way humans would. Post-mortem brain tissue patients died due COVID-19 served way verify whether observations models made sense — provided insight brains critically ill patients moment death.

This three-pronged approach provides compelling evidence scientific community potentially accept theory neuroinvasion. also allowed Iwasaki Bilguvar group see virus able use ACE2 receptors –– surface proteins serve coronavirus’s molecular gateway human cells –– infect brain cells co-opt reproductive machinery multiply itself. also observed cerebral vasculature mice rearranged response oxygen deprivation.

Song Zhang said one surprising findings infection specific neurons affected surrounding brain cells, resulting death.

“We found virus infects cell, cell that’s infected actually doesn’t die, [but] rather neighboring cells around die,” Zhang said. “We hypothesize found cell that’s infected virus undergoes sort hypermetabolic state it’s using nutrients cells around need survive.”

According Song, group hypothesizes that, due viral infection, neurons adapt modify metabolic pathways. neurons respond ways similar would see strokes, tissues die due oxygen deprivation. Let's watch Manaus So, must travel, follow rules make sacrifices infect country.

Staying nice hotel two weeks hardly sacrifice. consolation even nose peaking out, something. better nothing. much better somewhat better nothing. online learning, alot times I'd click links would go 404 Found Website Exist, would physically incapable learning. Or, I'd question, try call teacher, get voicemail, send email they'd reply 3 days later 1-2 word reply I'd 3 days behind kept happening became 60, 90, 120, 150... fell completely mean right 1%, think misleading go facets disease. analysis data provided.

What find interesting upon reading article (which actually really 1% rate) see to company President Joanna Geraghty, research by **Harvard’s T.H. Chan School Public Health** could great deal consumer confidence. institution, said, has found combined benefits indoor mask wearing HEPA air filtration systems yield “less 1% risk transmitting Covid aircraft.”

(bold own)

So quoting Harvard research. would correct print Harvard School Public Health says less 1% chance catching covid flight. thought strange way providing information. 'amid COVID crisis'. Except exactly nothing virus. cause measures sub supports. neighbors idiots persecuted. guarantee state's gonna get fucked soon.. jesus fuck Roughly one-third New York patients antibodies, compared 3.6% Texans 3.8% Californians numbers aren’t accurate  Sorry coming asking question... wrong. Go see yourself.
As 35-year-old working man Beijing, I've hardly ever Beijing, hometown Hebei. people cling colorblindness quietly content narrow notion black poverty explainable ""black culture."" frustrating. nobodies talking new CDC data chart showing 0.0003% fatality rate kids 1-19 0.054% 70+ 🤦🏽‍♂️ Trump can’t even tell us one detail plan would replace ACA with. nothing bad happen right? think inside job? Well Florida decided send everything back normal 100% capacity restaurants, bars etc. Saturday saw tons people wearing masks even stores mask requirements posted. One person helpfully told need wear one anymore.  


Soo...about 3 weeks prepare watch Florida cases skyrocket again. Florida won’t close again. Governor doesn’t care many get sick die. getting downvoted? still likely vaccine 2-3 years.

Haven't people following setbacks Oxford vaccine? would administer child’s vaccinations provider would order them. took baby for. 15month appointment receptionist medical assistant weren’t wearing masks talking feeling ill. medical assistant complaining girl called sick. said “I don’t feel well I’m still here”. Yeah, left baby. first appointment day btw. never return practice obviously. Texas. people think we're advanced 20th century lol realize there's still people alive far Ah noted, thanks clarifying info! remember said election come Drain Swamp even like it. Someone convinced use rally got much fervor inspired base. site diagram NJ jug handles. Type common trying describe. It’s like using highway exit... turn left. (And feels much dangerous....)  would seriously consider quitting can. That's awful school turn science time teachers dying It’s high *with* half world shut down. don’t even want think death toll would republicans way. Dang kidding, mom passing next weekend Florida Christmas. thinking asking stay little longer maybe I'll try convince stay extra week see numbers look like. much better SC least shopping.

My step dad lost cause wheeling Orlando ale house body bag willingly changes ways. thought masks compulsory places like UK. Totally. 200,000 dead Americans.

Almost million fellow human beings dead worldwide.

It didn’t way.

Stop playing games numbers. issue even enough testing know right move. locked month set virus's growth back days, also give us month find tests. already wasted 2.5 months knew would need tests expected CDC take care it.  Looks like said something stupid! Biden going take office 5 million cases, say ""okay, year later, we're lockdown real, China style"" gonna ride hurt economy? news, 49 states + Puerto Rico decided close border Floridians foreseeable future. fantastic science experiment witness. feel bad workers get polluted idiots wearing masks. innocent lives lost super sad. could contained anti-science types. ignoramuses. Sure, I'm going wrong lol. test positivity rate still 10 percent, they're rescinding limitations gatherings, mask ordinances. Yeah dude, going get bad again. Fuck noise. Get vaccine, live life build healthy body immune system conscious living. it’s dangerous, mandate HAZMAT suits full face respirators public it’s “safe”. 
FUCK FEAR! Japanese experience levels influenza colds rest world. Wave 500? like devil's waiting room, amirite? God damn fucking flu. paranoid year nbd correct. looking for:

“And you’re even older. 
 you’re even older. get fewer 0? Yeah, restrictions schools educational establishments operating render functionally dystopian.

In UK government toying idea locking students accommodation Christmas prevent possibly bringing back COVID.

You cannot educate people properly social distancing bubbles like this. Really?

You wear mask October 2021?

You'll march right behind person grocery store line?

You'll refuse give stocker seconds notice give time move pushing bubble get produce?

Doing simple things ""putting life hold?""

Like, real?

I get it. There's lot simple mildly non-intrusive things reduce spread assist vaccine crushing thing going them?

Because, exactly? Yeah I'm complaining take precautions 80% people around don't.

Selfish assholes care themselves. That's majority subreddit. Everybody cool endless lockdowns likely leave houses anyway work affected industries.  call tropical Northern Hemisphere summer numbers low. we've seen virus cold weather disastrous. Chile, South Africa Argentina main contributors southern hemisphere numbers throwing everything strictest lockdowns world.

I used deaths rather cases deaths accurate representation outbreak, cases largely dependant testing greatly improved. WTF. horrible health care industrial complex.  Except 18-25 year olds sudden mysteriously started huge spikes Madison. Winter actually scares much more. We'll soon fighting ""is regular flu, covid"", many households. Yeah, unusually low type IFN secretion noted COVID-19 patients back disease mostly issue China... Since there's lot research possibility type 1 IFN secretion key creating early immune response actually control virus. 

Then unexpected results cloth masks strong protective effect wearer rather purely source-control protective effect others.

Vitamin D- Vitamin plays important role regulating Interferons, could reason vitamin insufficiency coming risk factor.

I'm pretty sure virus *strongly* seasonal encourage people recognize seasonality seasonal viruses seems strongly associated temperature person's nasal cavity. Masks might help, even home alone. skimp heating costs winter. take risks prolonged excursions cold outdoor temperatures. sad. RIP Beverly. downvoted oblivion. Yo sub... true. It’s amazing hot face get. think even reddit even alive 2022 things continue like exactly think it’s way easier things masks distancing make consequences less dire things get better faster....all would way difficult bring back disregard easy safety measures vaccine instead while, don’t think hard agree. far first time we've seen dance. 

1. cases percent positive skyrocket

2. couple/few weeks later, hospitals fill start getting overwhelmed

3. government's hand forced mask mandates business closures come in

4. cases decline hospital crash eases

I'm pretty confident predicting that's exactly what's going happen midwest. think they're stubborn stupid leaders populations Florida, Texas, Arizona, exact shit happened months ago. 

The question impact season process. step 2 get even dire? step 4 take longer? March, beginning cough slime, turned dry cough. persisted month, every time activity walking faster usual biking home work would coughing fit. end, bad would describe experience normal winter cold. Imagine somebody would told one year ago would able go jail throwing party. Thanks, COVID. Fauci loves takes two months get idea spread reopening. people still go vote know many already infected. Real death counts pile election. 

I think fl desperately becuase think mail dem votes number person repub votes gov give clear reopening, people might stay home. trying ensure people go vote. It'll result thousands avoidable deaths. literally perfectly designed format. Instead threw away everything good book make terrible, generic Brad Pitt action/horror film. 

I even finish movie plane. frustration all.

It's realizing effective vaccine several years. simply reasonable expect people indefinitely.

I know won't. respect MIT. Sanders good run Independent candidate? Oh yeah would gotten nowhere without ""D"". 

He needs big D, he's hungry convenient him. America haters pretty quiet. job travel United States.

I support family 3 myself.  WTF-F do?  

Stay home?

I home 3.5 months 
job died March. started watching it, bring finish it. heartbreaking. well educated well informed populace, that’s what. That’s authoritarians stripes attack educators press. Notice, that’s particular political party US decades. r/savedyouaclick Warren got law degree Rutgers. bachelor's Houston. Yeah, right. That's much better site. I've looking something like that. something government providing. government run website app showing level infection area know cautious need be. Tell dying families longer us. would also leave people incapable vaccinated heavily scrutinized public.

Medical records public view reason. Shocking, mean vaccines given virtually?! pediatrician family doctor everything possible keep seeing patients person. I'm safe understand virtual appointment reasonable substitute.  Currently hospitalizations low point close lowest point since pandemic started. would worried lockdown now? think Florida proved make peak without lockdown. right question it, large volume asymptomatic/presymptomatic/mild cases nonetheless continue spread means positivity rate heavily correlated well catching cases much virus allowed spread. 

In nutshell, positivity rate 5% below, virus likely spreading, average, one infected person one person fewer. rates high because, point out, catching symptomatic cases. good thing, insufficient goal stop spread virus community. I’m actually sure. remember seeing something saying someone finds much energy, mindful much exposure. 

If someone bipolar, though, I’d imagine it’s recommended “high” time use “lows.” hopefully paper flat wrong somehow. read thought 'well that's double plus ungood'. need cheering highly recommend Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse books, #4 came Audible. good thing covid19 99.7% survival rate! Damn Florida Yep highly recommend all. think Corona spiking rn US? elections 1 month away hsve debate Tuesday Yes...otherwise known Darwinism. hear Mark Hamil one voice actors! Love work Flordia Man Smert. RemindMe! 28 days someone could predicted issue. complaining people taking precautions yet traveling country Well anti maskers get sick die able spread there's that. I’m best find balance safe finding safe activities (I.e walking, going drive, trombone, etc.) understand feeling. I’ve lost faith couple friends family members Yes people lives talk don’t revolve around current political events. last time conversation person? Correct. skip going businesses can. Always wear mask in. dont go many people there. could still get mask tho. freedom always subject change. can't freely walk around murdering people. freedoms exist context society allows to. People agreed let do. 

I'm sorry failed society. However, work change hopefully someday decide join. Magic 8 ball. Plus general observation lackluster response many states mask enforcement, gathering restrictions, social distancing. hard predict people catching covid means deaths.

I hope people get flu vaccine year though. Tough get treated flu complications hospitals full covid patients. worse, catch once. It’s like one makes immune other. Let’s see. Regardless reality pandemic, next fall, longer act responsibly. Instead act pandemic knowledge subsequent health guidelines followed. right far? 

And okay you’re frustrated, hasn’t fair lot people also feel way. missing? pandemic itself, reaction 2019, deaths children 5 developing countries. we’ve screwed countries even numbers well rise. fair World War Z US President sorts country saves darkest hour heavily implied Colin Powell: Republican. 

The book critical parties US society general. guy get rich spreading lies fake cure (while also saying could charge people whatever wanted since desperate), rich celebrities livestreaming quarantine secure compound, media pundits right left pretended hate other, government fucking response royally despite advance knowledge save many people possible, etc. 

I know zombie book going turn lot people off, analysis country world whole responds absolutely spot on.  worry, they'll dead soon lol post that! something old man used say many, many years ago I've never heard anywhere since. :D Yes, agree may better methods. Maybe methods implemented rather methods implemented. 

Speaking seniors, virus effects younger people too. left unkown long term effects. believe age factor decide life valuable not. personal opinion. 

And thank civilized conversation (I sarcastic). nine them? 2020 all... still 3 months new 'surprises'. hope horror movie end 2021 start 2022 covid history. know plenty nurses getting vaccine right away, made to. frontline workers want get it, great. forced medical field thing.  


FYI: bias, mom nurse. Although already said place tries pull that, she'll politely tell fuck off. travel WI last weeks visit family. Opted drive instead fly, there's way I'm stepping foot airplane.

It's mind boggling different upper NE taking precautions vs. midwest. first things seemed overkill name phone number everywhere, special que lines distance, limiting number guests stores, wrappers everything/disposable items, hand sanitizers EVERYWHERE, mandatory 2 week quarantine....

We booted first place went, proposal inn New York. know 2 wk quarentine. drove 13 hours straight get night. thought Illinois good state, low numbers.... wrong. honest, said quarantine since leaving IL (even though wear N95+lvl 3 strapped tight face causes bruises anytime public. much respect northeasts rules even though hard told leave....I'm adult hidden tears way out. 

Sure, really remote areas, one stop sign type towns, people general store wearing masks, seemed extreme minority. Even hiking waking streets people wore masks.

It heaven. felt safe cared for. felt like EFFORT safety. New York, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire.... guys amazing. Keep rocking on. stopped trying reason them. I'm position quarantine indefinitely. far I'm concerned, infect we'll see things end up. longer concern, feel terrible people fortunate me. think get you’re saying. agree many essential workers got shafted comparison received money staying home. happened supplemental salary government essential workers. sacrificed stayed home. again, essential workers job. It’s likely significant number received money still unemployed. It’s definitely no-win situation. 🙁 know got COVID. 

For know, asymptomatic carrier also wore mask (remember, masks 99% effective). 

Would call killer too? guy legitimately putting mental health people verge. Faucism another pandemic born epidemic. good news vaccines (at least trials far) high efficiency rates. Something like 90%+ 

Compare flu shot, around 60% effective. That's... thing Fair enough, that’s reasonable position take. depends kitchen, though. staff mask up? struggle really large numbers sample sizes, huh? think they'll tell much later whole trial (or local subtrial ends).. Knowing would affect behavior skew results. Yo fuck sub become based wtf Well...bye Florida live boonies Midwest. told friend people near us randomly sampled see would give blood testing. I'd guess 25% from. Burn down, covid. Rain hell non-believers. truly Florida Midwest. 200 Friday Bay Area. Damn. FWIW - There's something like 140 vaccines currently testing. believe 9 Human trials. asshole refusing wear mask store result passes virus someone else dies result absolutely killing someone selfish assholery. 

Your comment like saying OJ didn’t kill wife, knife did. 

Like said, we’ll likely never know became infected, could’ve 100% wearing masks, washing hands, etc... someone else decided refuse wear mask, may killed. 

Every one videos see /rCovIdiots people store/plane/restaurant refusing wear mask leave... right *can* happen result even customers masked, washing hands, etc... Wisconsin past week confirm. People wearing masks, even employees gas station, liquor stores, etc. Right, point highly unlikely US accounts 1 5 world's COVID deaths representing 4-5% population.

It also accounts 1 5 confirmed cases. US handled covid really, really, REALLY badly. promise drive truck full Amazon packages got stuck border, come in? Source? Dude making points me. give go back r/Conservative sure love county seeing another spike. ~500 3 weeks ago. 700 last week. Almost 800 week.

Douglas County, Nebraska (Basically Omaha surrounding suburbs) solely blame Trump? talking disappointed friend more-so anything said Trump. comment replied made think this. asked friend supported came money. He's still one best friends, talk everyday. sad see money sole motivator support president there's million reasons support candidate much weight. keep sending children school sure nothing bad happen promise drive truck full Amazon packages got stuck border, come in? That’s rich. WTF? feels like we're back Dark Ages. People wanna think anymore.  guess what? recommendations much better way it.

This virus scary vast majority population. right way handle *recommend* people wear masks socially distance. legal lockdowns, mandated shutdowns, forcing schools close. Overreacting like breeds distrust fatigue. literally says Covid-19 right top page, well throughout. know know not, pandemic started 2019, hence called COVID-19. can't seriously slow. Fatality rate worthless. IFR care about. Get act together. way behind things. Let correct that. could hypothetically, highly improbable. said yourself, highest jumps hospitalizations average less 50% Meanwhile Bay Area never even got close capacity cancelled urgent surgeries cancer screenings months. u spread misinformation lockdowns u say point something different? 

Also number false. It’s 15 it’s 59 active cases three weeks ago 130 cases. 
So what’s point ? Pneumonia isn’t highly transmittable respiratory virus. 

They completely unrelated. may well ask people care drunk drivers killing 100k people year 6 million others die cancer. it. Fox News tells say week, mindlessly parrot that. constantly-shifting stream lies keep intellectually-minded people busy trying reasonably argue instead walking away like should.  We're feeling strain. We're high risk live area pandemic taken seriously (by citizens well local county officials). So, we've fairly isolated past 8 months. We've done things listed article going think others preparing months isolation. One thing, we've buying lot houseplants gathering supplies fall/winter backyard container vegetable garden. Growing things good us. plants cheerful look at, gratifying watch grow, caring adds sense purpose routine, I'm sure air purifying properties houseplants beneficial too. I'm sorry, also place pick Amazon parcels buy gas. there, stock American snack foods. 

It would craptacular place go drinking, particularly border cross way back. like there's recent alert saying ""Milwaukee County seeing concerning trends weeks stability key COVID-19 metrics. seeing increases daily case counts well troubling increased trend percentage tests resulting positive, changing key metric cases yellow red. time, hospitalizations beginning increase, mirroring concerning rise hospitalizations across state."" anything, 

And then, quoting,

Here’s good news: past two weeks Milwaukee County’s COVID-19 spread ranks 34th 72 counties.

Here’s bad news: actual rate Milwaukee slightly slowed, going 170 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents 158.8. Milwaukee’s fall top 20 (it still worst rate length pandemic) driven growing spreads elsewhere.

Washington Ozaukee county, 226.8 181.1 cases per 100,000 residents, counties border Milwaukee higher rate. Washington’s rate places 20th state.

Waukesha’s rate fallen 133.7. Racine stands Milwaukee good. live nearby. still really high numbers. overall state sucks mean ignore going long die love judge? mean I'm judging stupid that's me. least Florida is. appear sorry ass back pen. would never wanna go seeing disgusting wet markets videos people eating live creatures shit. They're nasty ass group people. Cooking sewer waste crapping streets? Nah I'll pass China. start every pandemic epidemic. traveling, sports crowds, person school, conventions. Basically nothing fun. 

I’m joking course, scary thing is, people think indefinitely. earth still considered valid counterpoint?

We're past point. pro-COVID crowd longer even feels need reason explain they're doing. leader said so, that's why. says lot incompetence governments worldwide handling disease... unfortunately also humans think know better. outside? u kill grandma! STAY-AT-HOME! Beats shedding coronavirus. ain't never met Asian fellow sick homeless. I'm sure personal life experience alone adequate sample size speak authority. /s ....Or burned heathcare workers trying keep functional healthcare system. Amplify everything people hear nothing. honest, zombie outbreak US zombies would starve less week. stupid. Millions getting sick hundreds thousands dying would lot worse economy lockdowns. 

Governments locked super strictly, tested everyone regularly, closed borders, isolated/treated infected. Then, weeks virus would eliminated. People could gone back normal lives minor safety measures lots testing make sure cases escaped detection.  Yes friend lot people constant state fear naturally leads mental health issues. think fool would gym time. Fauci, papers exist Rand Paul believes lower threshold herd immunity.

At 2% PCR-confirmed infected population, new cases drop like rock nearly everywhere. CDC estimates 11x many cases diagnoses. idea 20-40% herd immunity threshold witnessed society large. read top drop sec got hopeful :( cares likes Trump lol sound like child. think solely Trumps fault type hatred actually really sad. It’s literally affecting view people real world. Definitely dark times. got virus Sept 29th last year. Almost 1 year ago. left permanently fucked inner ear. feel sick ear symptoms. get annoyed people take covid seriously. I'm proof simple virus completely alter life without ending ER. care mental health discussing mass shootings, that’s end sentence. I’ve actually dreams telling people stores wearing masks🙃 Unless exact systems worldwide exact kind testing uniform way, there’s absolutely way know that’s true. 

All really know reported deaths US compared reported deaths worldwide. 

What don’t know accurate either numbers are. 

I’m willing bet there’s tons deaths deaths third world countries never counted. 

The US terrible that’s whole story. There's huge economic benefits countries used lockdowns stop community transmission. China's second quarter GDP +11.5 % NZs forecast 3rd quarter 11.5%. V shaped economic recovery used lockdowns stop virus clear. much lockdowns cause global recession failure use needed get to. Locking stopping half way makes lockdowns useless. I'll interested see 


As right (Sunday night, 27th September) 


**Florida**  
Total COVID19 positive cases: 763,974 
New cases today: 1882 
Deaths since 1 March: 14,202 
New deaths today: 12 


**My little county 180,000 Panhandle** 
Total COVID19 positive cases: 6179 
New cases today: 17 
Deaths since 1 March: 109 
Deaths today: 0 
Number schools students tested positive: 22 
Number positive students: 48 
Number students teachers home due close contact: 489 killed COVID, another human being. Unwilling passing highly infectious sometimes-asymptomatic disease ""killing"" somebody. I'll reserve judgment. willing drop morals something low 15k / year

Can't drop never had. policies proactive targeted local lockdowns, mobile surveillance would require big changes legislation West, strict travel limitations, someone know. Ugh. Sitting Minnesota hoping escape surge Midwest. save Polls indicate people countries barely wear masks: reality mask mask, normal human patterns behavior, covid hard control. need learn live reasonable precautions. stopped paying attention realise Australia's numbers low. good news.

That puts us incredible position wipe open confidence ala NZ... pretty exciting! Trump loses, pro-COVID crowd literally fight Democrats tooth-and-nail every step way. gun-toting protests EVERYWHERE.

If Trump wins, sign validation right, force everything back open. hope case enough people still common sense refuse participate economy, causing massive depression even bigger shift next mid-term elections...if make long. absolutely does. everyone testing positive need hospital bed  Hawaii same. underestimate ability numbers get control. like 12 btw people literally falling streets China March. Speak yourself, I’m perfectly ok it. governor Florida Thinks number one coronavirus good thing. Herd immunity pipe dream virus. someone lives Arizona, sure hell go away got hot. don’t male alpha male attitude. I’m female friends passed away female guess sexist generalization wrong. say give up, maybe still taking precautions letting define life. everyone built like isolate months end. Mental health real issue.

I definitely become bit loose restrictions since beginning, reasonably safe. say again. depend rely government educate children, provide healthcare, provide safety, etc. 

This you! responsibility.
For healthcare, go around eating garbage consuming high sugar &amp; trans-fat. people point simple idea consider good them. Diet, exercise etc. Please take care health. smoke drink alcohol. Alcohol literally poison. forms acetate body literally poison. understand people born health complications health issues avoided exceptions, majority health issues keep seeing poor diet &amp; exercise. Obesity heart disease two common deaths US. Add Smoking Alcohol intake. fucking excuse. Change habits. 

Now education, again, lazy parent expect others raise child. child important government school; hence, job raise education plays huge role. child expect others raise it.

Safety; easy. Whether corporations court justice etc. watch safety. rely police protect criminals. rely government protect rights. rely bosses corporations care injuries health whether physical mental etc. went Wendy's today absolutely full. masks, course. even gone grocery store since March. keep curbside pickup tipping well employees work. Best solution could come with, anyway, least I'm one less person store contributing potential infection, hopefully get use extra tip money whatever need feel safe/happy. Fatality rate taken John Hopkins University analysis CDC compromised since Whitehouse took data considered tainted Retail stores explain inappropriate application healthcare, defense, etc essential national security, are, broken supply chains created healthcare disaster earlier year. Wearing mask 110 degree LA summers fuckin brutal. hear saying, Mike Rowe already explained college degree help instead choose backbreaking hard labor job destroy body I'm 50. already explained could making 6 figures decades experience put shitload overtime. already explained that's better alternative getting engineering degree making 6 figures entry level position. fact, I'm surprised Rowe even able successful, degree holder. see wants open doors people open him. Big brain time. even eaten food since March really ""harmless"" people 30, even were, we'd still links chain could (probably would) infect someone would die. Either way, hospitals would become overwhelmed reach capacity, anyone needed care severe injury disease able get it. sucks everyone choice taking precautions causing even people die. win, there's even breaking even, choices suck, best stop looking lockdown like unnecessary suffering. really wish they'd allow individuals carry 8 foot pole pushing away idiots. recently spent time family without mask first time since March felt wonderful carefree. momentarily made forget depressing shitshow been. people never complacent. people needed lockdown go work. workplace gave us papers show police case issues.  2014, Simon hot seat emails documents Simon, Lai several senior staff hacked leaked local media. contents documents showed detailed funding pro-democracy activists plan Occupy Central protest. Jimmy Lai allegedly footed HK$3.5m hold unofficial referendum Hong Kong activist played active role ongoing anti-Beijing protests raised suspicions photographed meeting senior official US consulate.*

Do think HKers know funding/organizing/strategizing things like ""Plan-35"" like it? think people forgot US Russia via Yeltsin?

Anyways, going change fact foreign-backed regime change attempt lost, again. time NSL, hopefully good. Go stay go, thanks.  use mask child died covid? damn Military spouse here. run family's budget let assure you, friend sold soul lot less 15k. make people afraid let things go,  deaths

you realise ""millions deaths"" statement govt report used justify devastating lockdown, also group scientists predicted 80k+ deaths Sweden actual number turned 5.9k  obviously never... hope vaccine. Better pray one turns good efficacy. 

At best, we're probably going going slow burn 1000 deaths day February. almost part 22 10 years ago. ever need ear let know. joke. way people react people without masks honestly makes wonder there's hint truth conspiracy theorists. People scared that's caused lot problems. done shut properly may made long term easier. ready done well

Everyone it’s negotiation. virus phenomenon punishment. say suffered anything? quote said that? course suffered, losing senses awful. facing house foreclosure losing children CPS living streets virus took away ability work would also suffering, no?

Only point I'm trying make things ""about money"" enough live comfortably. live paycheck paycheck poverty, money survival. food, shelter, heat, electricity. lose ability put roof head virus took brain away hell.  would pretty amusing turn events lol Dunno, trend non-elite schools charging $50k/year needs stop. nothing else hope zoom classes illustrate insane college prices (even normal times). infuriating, even like we're still declining. surging again. AGAIN. 

Outright denial situation signaling completely okay people dying. ...unless privacy home also illegal/against emergency orders. I’m debate coronavirus angle, blanket statement pretty absolute. he’s going governor’s orders think they’re within rights penalize him. fucking sociopath. capacity empathy. power control. flock show infect power trip. Unfortunately many military members exactly support Hey Utah think Wisconsin priz
e are... Ahh gotcha, thanks! marker (red line) dont mind asking? Yeah im keeping clear people wearing mask. Screw that. forget US.

US schools far behind lack online learning options equal quality (for standard comparison) person learning.

The pandemic means lot kids US going get half assed education couple years least that's ""the best schools do"".  going matter. people scary part now. someone said, something completely unrelated truly worth lamenting: SAD!! city lack caution phase 3 reopening leading us straight second wave. 100 new cases day back 500 day. I'm Georgia thought things would way less masks think people get vaccine actually. That's fine w me. vaccine finally allow respectful amongst us take health idiots hands K-shaped recovery: rich people recover quickly, poor people get poorer

There's question I've mulling and, honestly, getting sad recently: anything done? way fundamentally change incentives US economy value lives money? I've come empty, makes real sad. 

I hope people still looking local neighborhoods trying good around them. I'm sure anymore... first year got one. say ignorant covid thing didn’t understand importance flu shot. We’re okay many people dying anymore. Wait see though, drop government assistance. anymore. next 2 quarters going pretty. Downloaded app. Ready rock n roll. Really wonder flu vaccine rates end like... one hand everyone talking importance flip side, got system hell bent keeping people away many vulnerable obviously staying away. Sure flu rates low even still...  would winter make things worse?

Because coronavirus coronavirus infections spike winter. That’s YOU. world I’d like socialize people outside home, masks impediment. never wear one soon I’m vaccinated. mean, read news lately? Yes 11 PM though lol... reduced hours. dont understand mentality behind decision though really. Florida's percent positives site totally jacked. Here's official numbers: http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/092620-1359-covid19.pr.html

The site linked shows 2-3x percent positive.

Weird. guess so. 

The real world competition. 

You 30 year old covid

And 30 year old covid, “full recovery”, questionable long haul symptoms 

Competing career

Like said, one mans loss another mans gain Haha, tried get overly specific sounds like falls ""small investment keep happy later"" me! Yeah let's pretend mostly republicans pushing masks  blame them. keep closed! think like super severe, super infective common cold. That's basically is. Yeah, totally unchecked collapse hospitals little peak wave. Partial herd immunity plus people staying home peak kill wave infection eradicate. months, infections begin again.

Probably, per Argentina/Australia bad winter fact US/Euro severity summer, seasonal like cold well.

It's severe ""live with"", affected immunity vaccines. So, contained massive testing. What's hard that? Nah money People busy focusing elect ion, riots, course new Judge Nomination drama thats spill like much tuna net... second wave? we're still first. agree GOP especially Trump worst offenders. coincidence happening presidency. 

But say ""partisanship killing country. Especially damn Republicans."" mean upset facts. Knowing quickly access information apply useful skill though. job going tell can't research working on. think education set back year however. ""I desperately want true.... therefore is!""  Conservatives accuse others guilty literally every time Nobody coming back China loooong time. careful interpreting ""zero new deaths."" Many states drastically reduced death reporting certain days week compared days. 

For Wisconsin, looking last 2 months (going back July 26) appears Wisconsin frequently reports far fewer deaths Sunday Monday days week ... Sundays they've typically reported 1 death (max 3, min 0); Mondays generally report 0 deaths.

On hand, 7-day moving averages two month period 4-8 deaths per day (on low end, 4 deaths/day happens 2 days, high end, 7-8 deaths/day mostly early August).  No, don't. wanted get unemployment, total shutdown 2 months, whole thing would contained. would prevented this, far less costly economy instead. ""shutdown"" US never whole country, lasted couple weeks States, never beyond 50% shutdown. let companies lobby declared ""essential"" shutdown useless. literally friend working ""shutdown"" fireplace factory. Clearly fucking essential. I'm from, have, lack caution phase 3 reopening leading us straight second wave. Oscar Mayer making vaccine? think someone said Florida state need bars, shops restaurants entertainment places open Florida income tax. hard time paying essential workers ppe:s long-run.

That sad unfortunate. 😭 Northern Milwaukee suburbs. There's delay cases deaths. deaths low (even they've slowly rising lately), hospitalisation ICU rates steadily trending upwards. Um....Fuck. seems like reasonable option people start using brains!

Canadians want NOTHING Americans right now. rate, summer border opens back - we're lucky. seen new testing locations set since early summer. One large healthcare systems area ""covid line"" call schedule drive-thru test (without needing call doctor's office) closed late July. frequently see people social media asking how/where get test. 

So many folks (at least Milwaukee suburbs) still wholeheartedly believe hoax. much racial political divide. We're taking towns 70%+ voted Trump 2016 would laughed local event wearing mask. 

To honest, avoid watching local news.  see clips governor giving frequent updates. fun downplaying hundreds thousands dead coming months Speaking seniors, virus effects younger people too. left unknown long term effects. believe age factor decide life valuable not. personal opinion.

I mostly agree. Life life, matter age. think said anything contradicted that. Yeah, would prioritize life kids people lived average life expectancy. think there's anything wrong that. 

The long term effects really science, politics. way early definitive it. Respiratory viruses often cause side effects damage, sometimes last months. Usually resolve. one sure if/how virus different long thank civilized conversation (I sarcastic).

Likewise. ""Fatality rate 2.9%"" LMAO!

IFR lower 1%. Read little. Florida far fucked. love we're getting back living.  Case point true. feel gender changing speak 

*starts vibrate uncontrollably* People stupid! infuriating. 

Another people saying cases total (democratic state) Washington X state ... first all, that's short list days, second ... valid battling longer period time. Shit. believe almost one. Yea pretty sure able think well enough work worse able taste lmfao dude get fucking grip yet. There's three-week interval infections deaths. We'll see October brings. hospitalisations ICU rates increasing steadily.  Let's stop pretending anything GOP Trump re-election. ridiculous spend many words dressing up. Fox even really talk covid anymore. barely ever mention it, pretend solved problem.


that's new Trump admin marching orders. ""The vaccine done, FDA holding back hurt him. Covid over. Pay attention best SCOTUS nomination ever"" 99.9% Wisconsin alive, worst case scenario. picture actually. Drunk AF. Dang seriously seems kind early u know ? Saw dude pretty crowded store Washington walking around, trump hat on, mask hand face chest puffed mugging anyone walked by. Shocking many people developed victim complex told wear mask, dude looking get told leave. 

I literally watched leave store like 30 minutes later still without mask even bought anything. it’s kind crazy tell someone kid go school can’t go work collect less half paycheck UI kind logic this? Stalin starved 10 million Ukrainians death. People history suffered far, far am. 

So what? 100% irrelevant. Isolation total fear job still sucks enormously. Party DUDES!

I ready done well. think things back normal USA March next year? Gotta high viral load theory... sure familiar ocean I’d guess it’s like “back wash” tide going creates small wave hits normal sized waves jacks enormously chaotically like Turn turn back again. Yep. I'd lot legal ^and ^illegal things move anywhere else. Really? Doesn’t seem like learned much anything treat since beginning. effective treatments? No. Seems like died senselessly nothing.

If wearing mask washing hands “knowledge” already knew literally hundred years ago. So...nothing done nobody learned thing 100 years. Grand. (In future news....) new spike CoVid cases baffles Florida governor...... Thanks thanks I'm wearing fucking collar fascist. think many people looked situation decided it’s time get life. I’m sure bothers lot. Survival rate still 99.98% higher anyone age 49 per CDC....I think fine. graph depicting rate hospitalization per 100k population due Covid. far, 0.17% US population hospitalized Covid-19. graph says little, actually conveys limited information. actually would use case: little month economy pickup. Remember reporting 10-14 days behind actual transmissions. time things really control elections over.

They trying convince people over. Half target audience believe exists. They're trying convince audience president improve economy. Personally, someone offered 100,000 euros infected coronavirus, would no-brainer. mean, that's essentially I'm anyway continuing go work every day risking infected. Every essential worker made choice well, many people obviously agree benefits keeping one's job outweigh small risk posed virus. Probably. might “restrictions” nobody listen give fuck. don’t now. aren’t designed live like aren’t gunna. puking anxiety yeah need try avoid dwelling cause, think right diagnose someone mentally ill troubling times making sick. different levels empathy I'd imagine PhDs acclimated setting emotions aside. gunna definitely miss social distancing 😬 Where's 'No Shit' button?

I'm going route, find particularly bad day, decide open bottle, hit harder.

Why not? like things get much worse. Lower half Illinois needs spanking also. Idiots. Canada make appointments advance, office always felt extremely safe clean we’ve fretted it. far like 15 cases city 34K tho. California Red zones almost voters Democrats red zones everything seems open, also higher Covid19 numbers. San Diego area OC kinda sorta prove Republicans control killing people. Florida I’ve said lot life, mostly person online honestly. Maybe 2020 brought online though. There’s lot shit going world, think covers bunch bases point. making living within state guidelines disgusting? Happened free Australia. Would accept two five years happening right now? mean upset facts. rarely independent class anymore. It’s taught portion geometry.

Yes, is. Geometry Trig. class high school attends. Geometry Algebra treated basic maths need graduate. took geometry high school. learned area square basic things like that. learn cosecant reciprocal trig thing.

The class literally called Trignaomety (Pre-Calculus). seem stuck thinking reality democracy. Good luck that. That's prestigious family right there. yeah Appleton quite liberal compared surrounding area (not sure why), immediate surroundings UWSP. 

But overall state timebomb, even Gov. Evers mask mandate help certain areas. Utah 1000 cases day like week now.

I called buddy working crowded gym one wearing mask. said made wear one enter, told could take inside. 

He also said wore mask friends bar made fun took off. Yeah, lockdowns. person wearing mask didn’t give depression spring. able see friends, leave apartment without chastised, evicted campus housing, physically ripped apart relationship, online lectures give depression agree, honestly said fuck took one wearing eat anyway, felt nice forget fear. Please shut fuck wear mask far optimistic am.

Its hell week. month ago one near going eat. every restaurant absolutely packed brim outside seating areas. packed. Yeah, I’d say people moving on. RemindMe! 3 weeks many alive election day? I’m sure means shouldn’t protect appropriately. OP saying, literally, arbitrary date simply pretend never happened. make Im really buying horror movie porn point.

That’s really ever bought first place. disillusioned doesn’t make counterpoint automatically correct one. Let die. gives fuck. Hell no. God-F' dammit. state insane. mean beaches nice bridges go water hanging bridges cool spots, holy shit! Bars getting around selling microwaveable food purchase local 7-11’s

There couple bars downtown Boston operating legally they’re literally selling microwaved Hot Pockets one two people night. It’s disgusting  Presupposes people would go shop buy travel bodies piling up. Assumes people cut back spending hoard people dying.

Like Bill Gates says people going ignore dead body corner eat... single dead person could mean bankrupt business too. Insurance cover business deliberately criminally negligent even got sign waivers

So no, can't guess... hypothetical 60 Lakh = 6 million.

India continues hot spot!! used say year ago too? Good you. That’s experience all. symbol pandemic conducive normal social life many people. mentions Minnesota broke state record number daily cases didn’t mention also broke record daily tests. positive test rate still 5%. Sure seem really smart!! think we're fairly certain hang around hours. seems droplets (because seems transmitted easily AC) nearly bad fully airborne. reasonable choice mask, give 30 ft 30 minutes SOP. reason think otherwise, please link it.  point understand high high positive test rates bad. Idk tell you. Day 185 state Every classroom taught plenty space teachers socially distance proper PPE. depends are. southern half Wisconsin around Milwaukee Madison actually semi sane (with spotty Trump havens between).

As soon go north it’s fuck gives shit “I hate y’all damn libtarded sheep wearin masks want mah gunz!”

Wisconsin swing state reason. Half population INSANELY different other. Milwaukee/Madison great actually two places keeping together recently less less people taking serious.

I live Milwaukee I’m originally Ohio. actually really love milwaukee. It’s really cool underrated city lot potential new projects coming life.

But cannot say rest Wisconsin. enjoy metros around Milwaukee Madison. gay man avoid north risk hate crimed. Imagine like Chicago Illinois: they’re state feel like two completely different places. think it’s comical people think wearing mask safe take seat restaurant magically immune COVID. wear mask anytime leave house I’m going restaurant taking thinking can’t contract virus I’m siting 6 feet away group strangers. can’t accept shit isn’t going normal proven vaccine majority population taken it. don’t seem concerned anything real serious days It’s North Dakota aware Milwaukee's % positive remained 10% state whole pushing 30%? increase testing cause rise cases positivity rate 25%.

An increase testing *is never* cause rise cases. (unless actually get infected testing center)

It's cause rise *known* cases. hurt whole generation. 

It mainly going hurt poorer students honestly believe nothing done it. need free public education U.S.

We something like state. called TOPS program. state pay college tuition + extra money 2.50 GPA make 22 ACT. 3.0 score 27 ACT get max amount money offer. able graduate debt-free this. Even dorm room covered. 

I understand can't national program. Parents definitely set kids obese. really blame kids growing in.this environment. Nothing different, mind, giving someone covid. Plus, I'm sure obesity dangerous young person covid. I'd definitely take covid ang taking additional 150lbs. 11% GDP travel/tourism, top 5 world, that's higher percent US. mean “North Dakota averaged 30%”? They’re 2000-5000 tests day maybe averaging 200-300 positives today mean it’s 30% increase? 30% tests positive? Oh know... clear quite time right-wing leadership banking people getting exhausted news longer ability care, they've done spectacular effect handwave away number scandals political sphere. Distributed Denial Outrage labeled faux-science term ""herd immunity."" It’s right wing counterpoint. Doesn’t make sense, needs **feel** right Neither Denmark Finland. half countries named don’t require masks. think care. Bars open again. Bar *seating* restaurants open  Shut fuck lol federal government going absolutely go history bungling response badly million Americans die. blood hands. one saying go current millennial group absolutely screwed financial crash (not mention growing shadow 9/11). paying social security program may around us, can’t property, etc. younger groups deprived quality education socialization long term consequences. 

For purpose? someone basically extra innings feel super safe? risk, need protected loved ones whomever responsible.

I’m ok distance begrudgingly wear mask public (where need worn everywhere outside home, even walks) get vaccine. don’t think one second nonsense that. vaccine bust, need open restrictions let us put lives back together.

Your attitude dangerous seem prioritize keeping old person alive extra innings long term consequences people actually around deal fallout generations come. It’s awful. Trig rarely independent class anymore. It’s taught portion geometry. Precalc trig thing. old trigonometry classes covered advanced triangle geometry. Precalc usually covers intro derivatives polynomial graphing, include trig function derivation, that’s small portion it. places cover trig-sub integration precalc, that’s rare I’m shocked it’s still rationale. saw interview someone recovering recently “I know real. I’ll tell everyone wear mask”. Like could see attitude earlier year, we’re nearing end 2020 blows mind people legitimately still think fake.

“It’s political” another one hear lot. Sure, political views shared world wide people countries around world faking too?  astronomically smaller population. 

New Zealand population: 6 million---
United States population: 330 million.


It's comical small NZ compared US. I'm closing lid bunker
 ain't coming zombies here. least know value brains I'd like people start standing six inches away open-mouth cough place soon vaccine available. Ahhh, remembered one haha sister doctor too. get hear exactly actual doctors saying. funny heard exact things you? People actually associate medical professionals somehow get exact opposite information constantly pushed sub. pathetic here.  month realistically interesting see. Yes, let's! data says reach herd immunity letting people get it. would millions deaths USA. locked residents apartment towers. Absolutely disgusting display authority Wow. Florida even get flu season? universal health care cost low costs patients like Sweden, Canada New Zealand? disruption education we're screwed already.  I've seen pictures... hospital literally released guidelines saying unnecessary travel especially state (if report quarantine least 1 day testing done), gathering 10 people related seeing daily basis. It’s self righteous. It’s grounded reality. Think Many people getting increasingly it

Is virus like tinker bell, real however many people believe fear porn isn’t landing hard anymore, it’s quite obvious.

It is. media politicians framing isn’t is. Don’t see judging thing others perception type magical thinking? doesn’t matter people think all? Milwaukee least handling things well outside spoiled college kids. People stopped giving shit recently. Yeah that’s obvious, I’m speaking anyone interest dismissing other’s emotions. I’ve never heard anyone articulate impediment way makes empathizing easy.

In experience, moved new city July, started new grad school, many wonderful new friendships blossom cohort/classmates wearing masks physical distancing. I’m struggling understand others feel socially hurt challenges really don’t mirror experience all. I’d never want dismiss valid emotions challenges I’d hope they’d wouldn’t dismiss mine. According video, masking, washing hands social distancing. sounds like we'll never know exactly became infected, surprise killed someone refused something basic like mask protect others store. nice, it’s something say, really covid really. response COVID convinced definitely see worst case scenarios climate change.  find Texas number active cases low Unbelievable. Remove far right morons office immediately. People mental faculties understand even basic science able hold office. examination determined mentally fit, put tribunal charge endangering population. Back March literally goal: Flatten curve avoid overwhelming hospitals. Despite people claim, never happened Florida Texas. come close happening anywhere, we're still locked down. That's people despise lockdowns much. entire country lied to, goalposts moved, told roll it. don’t problem interactions strangers. don’t need shoulder shoulder them. Wasn’t supposed “drain swamp?” Seems like almost everything he’s done make swamp worse. Yet past couple days shown infection numbers 10% higher tested numbers. don’t, not. I’m sure plenty nut job conspiracies China somehow hiding hundreds millions nose get cold spite face . stuff happening Ontario Quebec super scary. 491 cases here, 896 cases there. (I understand, Quebec 40% less people 40-80% cases daily??)

I realize businesses general shut again, economy collapse recover. stock market also likely crash stay time proof billions people vaccinated immune virus.

The saving grace nation have, unlike US House Senate, house (which gridlocked given minority government) coming together NDP able back temporary sick days (10 sick days COVID positive workers seems) avoid 2020 federal election, etc...and provincial leaders generally mindful public health (unlike Florida, lifted restrictions recently re. bars, etc...). Without vaccime, herd immunity another name many people infected virus can't find new hosts.

When vaccine, words least meaning terms predictive value number vaccines administered efficacy vs infection rates.

'Till then, need stop pretending value unless plan really let millions die. that's point. Fear fear. everything rational it, threat threat. Nobody talking encouraging panic. That's logical, considering way America handling pandemic, fault people worrying way do. Fear back fire. Optimism bias backfire, too. Can’t wait see headlines idiots Florida wondering many infected dying... responding directly. point arbitrarily decided virus primarily kills lived past average life expectancy bad enough to, whim, implement measures without clear benefit obvious costs. Costs like 10,000 extra children dying hunger every month. missed cancer screenings. Etc.

It's fine think implement draconian measures protect elderly, least acknowledge actual point, i.e ways go handling pandemic lockdowns masks. Especially we're past peak. missing point. Connections don’t even know immunity lasts three months. herd immunity may never happen. majority party responsible governing district? safe good enough? Enjoying food drink major part quality life - everything tied money Anti-mask crowd WAY bigger anti-vax crowd. Yeah business going that. Maybe company work make get vaccinated, stores ain't shit. second numbers go people stop wearing masks, stores stop enforcing rules go away. Name one comes close U.S. We've downplaying (lying) end January current day. hand, China downplayed 3 weeks.  We've lying masks, intravenous disinfectant, Dr. Demon Sperm, government ""briefings"" without medical professionals hand. Alex Azar controls statements FDA. Putin's former media consultant Michael Caputo was, recently controlling said CDC. think anything matches buffoonery going here.

Exactly. millions going starve developing countries bc lockdowns. would bring residents running back- easy route Canadian citizenship? Yes please. guess there'll less ""floridaman"" incidents on... genius plan avoid second wave ending first one? hospital workers get MRSA? virus already rampant jails. read news? work store masks mandatory state masks mandatory lady came told us need masks local mayor lifted lock Unless you’re 60+ years old dangerously immunocompromised, you’re way fucking paranoid. Coronavirus fake news thought way, makes ton sense. wear mask way anti-masker miss seeing peoples faces expressions huge reason can't get mask forever bandwagon. probably deeply ingrained first thought. Covering face seen oppression lot people Western cultures. Wow great comment lol giving lot marinate on. depression among people gone 20% careful pandemic effect mental health long time especially teens. Yes. Typos = illiteracy unique idea stumbled on. Also, know second grader waiting growed hoping cool like one day. F

These people deserves attention, someone tried best avoid COVID still became victim. 

Don't shed tears deniers get sick try warn others. Obviously previous people tried message fall deaf ears. almost October people know better point. There's vaccine coming, happen work fraction population. gonna live it. next one week. Tasmania closest land Antarctica snows quite bit. buildings could collapse world would lose nothing. It’s definitely way question. 1000 cases day symptoms demand testing April 1000 cases day September multiple widespread surveillance testing programs. Many 1000 positive results asymptomatic carriers. even eligible tested limited testing capability April. knowing isolating help contain outbreaks caused people feel fine shedding virus spreading others. Blaming people killing people analogous blaming gay community killing hemophiliacs AIDS epidemic. Let people live lives. non-military suicides? goes ways. parties weird attitudes toward minorities. Oh, much hypocrite are. SMH Education always comes first. US appear letting wash you, dangerous ultimately behest economy.

In UK keeps biting us badly stand lesson world. also dealing badly economic concerns, lockdown appears happen whim. North-East R number 1.2-1.5... total lockdown. London R number 1.2-1.5... keep working guys.

I know 16% Londoners probably clear, isn’t dramatic compared 9% Yorkshire. Reply comment BOT Indiana entering phase 5 reopening.  positivity rate 8.5%. Buckle up, going nasty winter. Right, it’s also matter education, also hands elected officials (though takes decades produce effects). problem assumptions obviously idiotic, widely recognized time.

Their model based firm assumption every place, COVID cases would follow bell curve. mean, really, unbelievably stupid that? Idiocy virus? good amount visit family/friends compromised? networking resources available. via outright travel bans, Trump prides himself. blame China virus. Why? Sure. know better come countries. That's seeing non-local new cases reported daily. Melbourne 4 thousand square miles. 

Please google population density fl Australia. 
In Miami dade 2.7 million county 2.4K sq miles. 

Miami dade population density 100+ Melbourne think usual restrictions put place (close bars, gyms, etc) numbers start climb ""unacceptable"" levels. People resume social distancing (having break end summer/beginning fall socialize feel normal), numbers tick back acceptable levels repeat again. long, boring, painful slog. Yep brain performance best right now. It’s sucks. existing inmates deserve getting infected? need isolate test, Mr. Vulgar. 3x less habitants country, 1.5x cases America big place. I'm saying lot places America actually taking serious people wearing masks distancing. original realized. However, places like Florida Texas others.  Show one positive story first 5 pages subreddit Since okay reopen Florida? live here! People don’t wear masks noses mouths, wear one all. saw kids sucking carts store. roads swamped license plates country, lines sit-down restaurants half-hour waits. reopening?? I’m plopping ass back couch last half-year state bonkers. There’s plenty home ffs.  comments make, less appear understand anything wearing mask standing feet away people really great sacrifice? No. sacrifice really conscientious. 

Apparently don’t think anyone age 30 risk. okay, delusion aside, means tragedy you’re complaining circumstances forced think *other* people. horrible burden you. 

Regardless, childishness I’m talking setting deadline it’s personal hold breath nature compromise them. It’s literally kid thinks. Got cha. evidence still new cases reported? glad live far away geographically possible idiots. replied ... THANKS ... earth, non vitriolic, non profane comments smirk humour. people need speak more. country needs showing .. oh yeah ... one thing ... vote November 3 ... eh 😜😜 book one special raw looks human nature probably somehow always stand test time. Like 1984 less impressive poignant extent.  Сколько Кремль платит вам за это размещение? Neither mine given CKD severe psychiatric issues, possibility COVID19 fucking head (or killing me) chills bone. much trouble thinking writing. assholes think perfectly fine put 300 people room fucking pandemic, yes, jail time bunch unmasked suck people punishment fits crime. 

I 100% guarantee someone went wedding going die COVID GOT wedding, or, someone else going die covid caught someone got covid wedding.

You want put 300 people room religious ceremony? Let's pulk bible talk ""an eye eye"" Yeah wearing mask darn hard it’s taking peoples freedom away. mean maybe put politics aside bs decent human being, don’t think that’s hard ask single person. Vit toxicity, manifest hypercalcemia. read. Maybe one problem CDC Putin's former media advisor [Michael screening anything CDC say allowing released public. interesting...it seems like cases picking over. suck..lol..now Florida going wide open, lets see happens weeks. Jacksonville confirm..... Texan here. time last year, folks touting Governor Greg Abbott potential POTUS candidate 2024 (after Trump would win re-election, natch)

nobody's saying anymore. fact recently chatter turned ""Abbott get primary-ed even chance get re-elected 2022"" They're dumb evil, they're driven money case limited funds support businesses closed people lost job. answer open endure consequences. Less votes trump people sick percentage die CDC: Can't Decide Correctly  agree lots testing now, always way. absolutely tests every doctor's office first week April, even people tested taking weeks results come back still taking days many places renders virtually useless. fact nearly 7 months still resources available successfully stop spread virus shameful. 

The story told 100% true happened end April. Ontario Canada freaking back 500 cases day... Florida 12000, holy shit. You’re easily forgetting even who’ve done everything right still fucked over. virus doesn’t give fuck who’s majority minority opinion. 

America ‘really good’. surprised Death tolls available every year. see compares average. Yikes... Interesting. true, would explain cloth face coverings effective medical grade masks. F Good. Keep general population locked down. Let universities thing. COVID burn 18-22 population (statistically one safest groups). Since students live campus low chance mingling local population bringing back home infecting household. gets locked India using one named ones pretty widely (I think, based read). look government advice mentioned SD BioSensor test. Sensitivity test (i.e. ability detect true positives) ranged 50.6% 84% two independent evaluations, depending upon viral load patient. Higher viral load correlated highersensitivity

Not bad, especially likely work well people higher viral loads. Results pretty quick 15-30 mins they're cheap. think issue false positives.

But they're replacement existing PCR tests, tool certain situations. Though improvements overtime alternatives (like SpectraLIT) they'll great.

I try find rapid tests used USA, assume Abbot ones? could never find out, read people tested also PCR test time? herd immunity works without vaccine. people going die die, rest live. advocate herd immunity it’s important remember that. Literally spreading fake news killing America; Faux “news” needs charged crimes humanity Speaking US point view, lock people coming wearing masks. not, paused reduced numbers slightly crippling economy. 

Had US done legit lock come masks numbers would fraction today. School events also wouldn’t challenge agree on. (Look Vermont states done well listened scientists). younger people actually socially distancing. Add Chicago suburbs list. tourist traps downtown. social distancing whole life?Otherwise might spread flu someone's grandma killed her. MURDERER! complicated that. Since lockdown happened \_before\_ holiday, many planning go home day holiday F'd. Especially migrant workers - stuck huge, unfamiliar city 100s km family.  Tbh I’m kind hoping vaccine little expensive first months wide availability family skip line. work pharma regulatory plan keep eye EMA does. don’t think FDA currently compromised though. Awesome. able use find Defendant's Brief Right there's possible reason people like go bars. love overpay drinks. keep stories rolling in! Meh cares idiots say? million cases per day, think moment. friday would what? 6 billion cases.. im good math. disagree. Lockdowns unfortunate necessary. worse virus. Death disease worse weeks isolation.

You're empirically wrong. extensive data linking unemployment mortality, coupled billions people worldwide livelihoods disrupted (add myriad socioeconomic problems caused lockdowns), tells us lockdowns kill many COVID could done. numbers close, could argue hard call, even ballpark.

Compliance restrictions majority countries high March lockdowns. UK, \~90%, higher governments expectations. That's incredibly lame, dishonest attempt explain away disaster lockdowns evidently are. Absolutely. people never wear mask politicized, like everything else, US. maddening. Huh? link posted says exactly said analysis, striking age 25 significantly lower risk death COVID-19 flu.  There's difference capability value pale redhead tanned brunette, one still sunburns easily. Medical needs differ populations without different *as people*. 

But know that. want excuse racist. Everyone goddamn fixated calling wave fact it’s slowly hitting specific regions country different times. wavy kind wave. Understandable. First wave march April - great uptick. till mid june increasing much, little declining great uptick again.

Sorry english. Peru: rookie numbers. ...do really think it’s supposed you’re? Indoors, streets, fas see Brooklyn Queens. Ontario trending Florida trending entirely black hats, give shit human planet. That's I'm staying put. Can't trust anything outside door. $4000 vacation outside home? would qualify? Since Black Americans lower compliance rates medical advice accounts life expectancy disparity, hope help build trust. Cruise, Airline, rest Hospitality industry tatters. Third wave? second one? want ban people different opinion you. Nice lmao... NJ’s numbers trending That's strong social safety net necessary protect workers situations beyond control.

Not able see friends family inconvenience. able breathe properly selfish dick care covid serious damage body even survive significantly serious important.

Pick phone call friends. easier someone dealing scarring lungs.

Well, get viewers sick, viewers would stay home means TV time higher viewership. best marketing strategy hey, whatever works man. **Submission statement:** early months pandemic, countries took unique bold step putting travel restrictions visitors China travelers passed China.

In total, 96 countries took unique, bold step implemented restrictions Shocker, response.

Keep spewing bullshit though huh? Anything fit narrative, definitely can't let facts get way feelings. issue, sure, important one one important metrics actual concrete data on. might clear issue, now. disasters alluding above, though? call zombies. Propaganda zombies. brains all. Shit. Maybe weve found way make Halloween educational. Lettttsss play game! Give candy year, little printed paper describes game. person finds smartie pack mnms give certain amount candy bag. Everyone received candy cant receive candy people eat whole pack mnms dont talk ten minutes. cant give candy people actual masks on. 

Well maybe year. basically make candy plague game Halloween trick r treating teach kids sickness works grow something associate concept with, kinda negative like much candy later. classroom add skittles mnms teach importance inspecting candy. Soon enough trend catches candy companies get every flavored beans thing companies make Pandemic Party Packs, people play sandman drinking games them. happens let opinions pour news outlets. country basically questions/argues standing position. country started encouraging masks, Fox News may jumped “everyone wear mask” dilemma. CNN may ran articles questioning actual benefit wearing mask, encourage people exercise right wear one don’t see benefit. country isn’t always left vs right. It’s usually think vs think. Great. I'm hungry. It'd cool tax money could used pay place every child compelled visit, threat law parents, would teach concept test understanding afterwards. allowing children advance test passed. shoud do?

He made mistake, wrong, admits - wrong

If kept stubborn attitude downplayed even now, bet would consider wrong well.

So really, do? maybe ""national behaviors render local lockdowns ineffective""

If motorcycle rally full infected people storms town really local's choice. parents, brother nephew live FL last week even aware state planned reopen full capacity. insisted business owners allow places business fill unsafe level (even though shown indoor dining lower full capacity still risky).

Never forget organized racism I’m Atlanta suburbs, it’s thing here. Things keep mind: ideal weather - it’s hot cold, dry HVAC air helps virus stay suspended air longer, people spend time indoors. 

Secondly, Georgia Department Health tracking rapid tests, become far common testing method virus. offices drive throughs rapid tests good way report results currently way reported central lab processing specimens. Also, answer question, yes. death elderly person tragic death young person. That’s human nature.

Let’s save congratulatory assessments threat comfortably over. We’re either socially distant wearing mask interacting people outside household time COVID? sounds like they're arguing infections rise great deal re-openings -- independent whether hospitals become filled capacity.

Yeah, agree that. Infections rise point human contact rises well. question is-- whats relationship cases hospitalizations? we've seen cases rise rise, hospitalizations rise strictly relative rate. I’m also FL, I’ve never seen many NY/NJ/MA plates past two weeks. birds coming.

Yeah, 100%. think we'll see *some* anti-mask ppl switch closer get sick die (it's already happened small doses) never hinted ppl would change, ppl already wearing one would stick it. one told dumbass, still decided one. repeated something [out point based preventable illness caused millions deaths including almost million children every year one ever cared, didnt make news, global actions whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

A rich folks developed countries die new virus doesnt even kill young people suddenly there's media panic billionaires making trillions. elderly died covid sweden already expected die illnesses, COVID DEATHS. Reality portrayed media completely skewed.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes virus exists, yes kills people, especially elderly either obese heart issues, nowhere near level gravity necessary measure like lockdowns cause plenty deaths virus ever could.

&amp;#x200B;

Its completely ridiculous people spewing crap months never admit wrong, especially politicians double stupidity stubborness course lobby drug companies making trillions worldwide this. disagree. Lockdowns unfortunate necessary. worse virus. Death disease worse weeks isolation.

The lockdown work many people cooperate. 

So agree point lockdowns, see point second-guessing historical decisions. decision lock March taken lightly governors involved, done reluctantly knew disadvantages. decision made, lockdown occurred, failed due deplorable behavior, are.

If lockdown worked, would disastrous worse virus. would saved us all. lockdown sabotaged recalcitrants facing consequences failure. Aged? They’re still it. Fox news made US exponentially worse.

FTFY Seems like COVID-19 stay matter actions taken now. endemic. likely circulating like cold mentioned hopefully therapeutics season vaccine significantly cut death/severe sickness rate learn live it. really sucks we're position. like this..... kind dumbass something? IMO they’re similar. different things country picky about. countries reputation especially difficult I’m wearing mask every time get sniffles. That’s like least 1/3 year since seasonal allergies suck. basically feels different start cold employer tried get us sign liability waivers ordering us back office. got laughed room someone I'm assuming legal, pointed can't really contract way liability.

Guys. Pres. Trump ain't lab playing bleach bright lights trying tinker vaccine formulation. vaccines created best brightest have. fall anti-vax trap Trump oval office.

Unless anyone evidence process tampered administration, save pain casting doubt vaccines. 

It's like unholy alliance right wing anti vax nutjobs people rabidly anti-Trump endanger others hashtag notmyvaccine. Ethics set aside scientific problem, problem not, leading problems. fully agree Didier Raoult said: ""The ones dying might die low life expectancy anyway"". meant evil statement, statement facts. can't sacrifice country's future cannot accept might easier die, die.

The alternative much worse. already worse. know people healthy age (18-45) suicidal health worsened lost jobs (entire sector wiped out) due confinement covid lockdowns worldwide.

Waste time start discussion. 1. coronavirus vaccine yet need. four endemic HCoVs cause common colds, SARS-1 went extinct due mitigation poor transmissibility, MERS extremely rare easily spread human human. animal coronavirus vaccines though. 

2. reason vaccines traditionally take long time test they're never tested active, highly contagious global pandemic event. God you’re boring troll reality it’s wave like one football game, simply go around circles United States decides get serious fighting virus. Thanks Sherlock 🕵️‍♂️ Plenty poor students use program.

Sorry you’re life apparently void things fun things people enjoy life can’t right Absolutely right! way see it, anyone following rules order protect everyone around them, deserve worst covid offer. People open become infected, go around 2 weeks infecting others get sick. knows many people dies irresponsibility. People government fancy all. one is. 

As getting downvoted, suppose goes territory calling people bullshit.  Travel companies currently absolutely desperate money.

In country currently run like pyramid scheme - people pay trips, trips happen due covid, people never get refunded, money used pay company stay afloat, pay debt etc.

I know people paid trips first months year still waiting refund. stock company raised meantime. :/ TUI stock also went today. numbers even relevant... even testing often enough large enough volume. That’s interesting . would guess company needed sales keep going could treated patients IND otherwise. I’m guessing patients don’t realize that. stopped researching whole thing back April. still believe easily mutate? Would make whole new vaccine mutates? fuck ton less. Come on.. every single person would follow rules covid would rare. done Easter merely optimistic ""hope"", prediction. Also, aside crowded cities outbreak sadly inevitable, America well infection rates peaked April fell end May.

America unique rural-urban divide along two parties become aligned, due obvious difference infection risk appropriate level economic restriction justified each, pandemic naturally became politicized level restrictions far harmful rural areas less ability accommodate them, less need degree restriction first divide fueled different realities presented media different people, already explained. really killed unity response leaders health experts anti police state local leaders inconsistent, *pivoting draconian warnings violating lockdowns mention COVID-19 all*, showing sympathy [Reopen] protesters. little inspire public confidence warning going church one week supporting public gatherings next, many state local leaders done. Indeed, riots major cities throughout country, COVID-19 often disappeared public discourse. Distributing masks gesture angry public hardly way continue fight deadly, highly contagious virus

Not mention ""everybody else it"" real psychological concept makes things feel less forbidden, applies going mass gathering saw 24/7 coverage protests praised much infection came directly protests, total undermining importance social distancing, confirmation people skeptical leaders objective risk analysis, deepening divide another divisive issue conspired destroy public faith experts concern really want know irresponsible, mostly **young** people spreading infection since two weeks protests began. repeatedly told ""mass gatherings safe mask"", defiance [actual CDC really keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social telling, 86% Americans feel ""**other** people taking pandemic seriously enough"". surprise. Let's blame fellow Americans betrayal journalists **both** sides leadership.

SIG still 30% pre-COVID high, ignoring everything pre-pandemic. think lot overvalued companies stock market right now? Sure, think disconnected reality. multiple. supposed 4 month lockdown unlocking last 2 months. unlocking seen higher numbers May/June. know long-term health effects young people getting COVID facing future, parties refuse support universal health care. country fucking insane run greedy rich people bought corporations need voted out.

Basically one government represents you, they're taking advantage enrich themselves. time serious fucking change. Everyone knows ""you're mom"", ""your mom"", jeez. English teacher? Neil Armstrong? point orders piecemeal, inconsistent, far less strict countries. Plus states got overturned (here Wisconsin lockdown ended Supreme Court we’ve effectively restrictions since June except poorly-enforced mask mandate). restrictions need uniform across whole country much effect - virus doesn’t care imaginary lines map. enforced!

Compare Australia (my home, I’m dual citizen) similar breakdown responsibilities Federal, State local governments: states imposed tough lockdowns travel restrictions, states agreed concrete criteria reopening based 14 day rolling average case numbers, enforced laws massive fines even potential jail time (though knowledge one sent jail Covid restriction breaches). worked: seven eight Australian states zero cases yesterday effectively back normal, state 5 cases (and still partial lockdown get good stretch low zero cases, happen mid-Oct).

It’s mind blowing different things are: even Australian states zero cases still basic restrictions (and enforced rigorously), health officials TV every day urging complacency, telling people get tested even slightest symptoms etc. state zero cases since June! Unfortunately I’m stuck Wisconsin 27% (!) positivity rate essentially restrictions outside barely-enforced mask mandate restaurant density limits *some* cities. US approach governing everything local/city/county level advantages ways it’s utterly terrible handling crisis like this. infection numbers speak themselves. Huh, didn’t realize still mid-summer 🤔 Actually, lot places cancelling black friday store sales. Maybe I'm optimistic things looking promising. guick tests dogs smell corona could game changers need fact could start seeing vaccines given risk groups quite soon gives lot hope *fingers crossed* think talking need restrictions lower hoped effectiveness vaccine. think Fauci saying 50% effective vaccine still result community transmission, continue masks social distancing, even vaccine widely distributed Americans. Even though, anything like flu vaccine, 50% effective vaccine 100% effective reducing symptom severity. 

I’m Canadian - Chief Public Health professional made comments, citing potential low levels vaccine effectiveness reason. talking it’s reprehensible reckless spread disease kills people, right? Thanks Dr. Obvious. imagine riots destruction Minneapolis heightened inflamed racism minnesota.

Cases plummeted three weeks ago Labor Day; since public holiday, testing *much* lower (comparable weekends). led 7-day average falling significantly days ramping back up.

The reality increase, nowhere near huge number they're reporting. Entering third period OT looking likely. BC total 120 ICU beds happens they're full coronavirus patients? Made worse lockdowns. certain point life needs get back normal. Remember long ago someone CDC (Fauci believe) said pandemic could controlled within 12 weeks everyone America wore masks distanced others?

Masks work. Listen experts. Fuck yeah. Luckily mine still well checks private practice. HMO's around us stopped them.

I put kids' summer low cases area. Getting vaccines always makes feel much better.

Local cases concerning Spring, went way summer. wanted make sure got dental checkups surprise emergencies Fall. any?

Edit: Getting downvoted asking question? Stay classy maybe read something mention completely dodge comment California incredibly illiterate. Somewhere bridge lost troll, sad *sniff* We've lockdown since March 23rd. Major restrictions ceased partially early month. speak medical devices experience number length clinical trials EMA far less FDA Everyone different definitions overkill based personal risk factors comfort level. would call overkill, that’s I’ve office since March nobody wears masks sanitizes anything. We’ve couple positive cases office, never spread anyone else (that know of—at time hard get test unless symptoms). 

Because I’m relatively close contact 15-20 unmasked people daily months, going remote cabin 5-6 people sounds much less risky me. since haven’t left house months, sounds extremely risky you.

It can't be, right? worldwide 33.46 million so, that's one tenth American population. also think true numbers known. every want get tested. Asymptomatic people covid think numbers 2 5 times higher. applies elsewhere world opinion. Canada short testing kits go line, test kits run day get test B line potential positive covid cases may catch didnt before. We've aware impending mental health crisis since March. easy address it, we?

Seems like politicians enforcing lockdowns simply care. yeah, great. shows adaption prevails. :) people beyond deranged. like cannot fathom completely utterly wrong, continue double disaster going cause untold suffering decades.

You sound upset reasonable pandemic precautions put place government save people's lives. sound angry, like little volcano rage inside wants erupt everybody agree you. majority people agree you.

Let idiots kill cripple friends family. Maybe make people realize (probably not). Perfect example democracy failed experiment technocracy way go.

Technocracy: ""The people's feelings hurt. That's expected, they're experts."" necessarily, definitely US pneumonia. Haha it’s funny cause kinda rhetoric used sub question interpretation data right.

If young healthy, virus unlikely cause major problems; main reason avoid prevent virus passed people. you’re moron makes stale old joke anytime someone shoves coin blow hole. Bad bot.

You translated English English. metadata clearly mark English document once. point, statistics countries near-real-time Excess Death reporting shows 700,000 Excess Deaths 20 countries Sept. 25. So, COVID deaths may notably higher official numbers today. Note excess deaths likely sources well (increased suicides, example).

Eventually, retrospective look aftermath COVID pandemic give us closer estimate deaths - really way fully accurately calculate numbers controlled manner over. Honest question EMA strict? bible.

Argument invalid, invoked fiction. government know much they're reporting by, doubt NYT know. point literally impossible identify many people COVID even many died it. Millions people can't afford hospitals professional care, millions live villages minimal communication governments cities. police already working overtime periods lockdown distributing food people unable go out, keeping people streets. means, India's lockdown system lot effective US's. However, can't keep people lockdown forever population high, impossible control spread long-term. Add everything else going India time COVID one many things government worry right now. generations never taught team players. know act greater good.

Since lockdown failed, common sense measures like closing bars, gyms restaurants, sporting events, businesses open. well virus still rampant community lockdown failed.

Should another lockdown? really think so, unless cases skyrocket winter, might do. 

Should open schools? Every time do, seems lead disaster, maybe not.

People think easy answers, longer are. lockdown worked, people cooperated used time upgrade testing, contact tracing PPE, answer would easier now. failed, due deplorable behavior minority, awful place. Well worthless comment. Sadly deluded people convinced lying merrily go kill others via arsenic M&amp;M. Without able see anything wrong sharing chocolate. left telling difference different racial groups largely skin pigment?   one positive covid-19 showed dad can't rely fox news information longer. Yeah, well know people think that.. rookie numbers, gotta bump numbers up. Jk, year complete shit, haven’t even gone winter yet say it’s going even worse, super pumped... mean self-care, provide paper evidence vaccination. efficacy high, maybe taking vaccine twice could help. Get together Ontario. Stay fuck home. Wear mask, social distance wash hands.

Good grief... I’d alright that! lockdown cases declining. GOP controlled state Senate assembly went cried GOP controlled state supreme court forced state reopen. plan place take lockdown forced end chambers working since like March. 

It's ok community go back work intermingle people make laws. awful governor try working idiots. work bar, bar that's livelihood? so, that's pretty big ""just"". advocates people go well... person needs start paying closer attention class. beginning short things while, almost ran toilet paper (thankfully already half costco pack would have). We've trickling entire summer make it. We've also generally upped beans rice (which helps offset meat consumption) easier pounds beans meat.

Start now, need overdo it, hit catastrophic shortage would now, keep bit extra hand anyway.

Also good make sure (if grill) get second propane tank, necessarily COVID power outages propane great still cook. Also filling uhaul something significantly cheaper swap services underfilled. people spoke India much concerned lockdown effects virus. population younger used infections saw hospital overflow Mumbai, much beyond according I've heard (I'm open data showing otherwise).

Prime Minister Modi huge lockdown that's everybody else did. realize social distancing slums Mumbai virtually impossible. Read somewhere back April Cuba using interferon based treatments. NJ's high death rate product several factors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. got hit first major wave March April. remember time well. one man Westchester (NY) become first suspected case community transmission, next day family neighbor, next day man Jersey City may building point NYC, two weeks later thousands new cases day hospitals City densely populated Northeastern NJ getting overwhelmed. outbreak escalated, concerning isolated outbreaks WA places, major explosion. still watching situation Italy unfold fucking around false idea ""it can't happen here"", sobering humbling, know exactly kind monster dealing wave cresting breaking overhead.
2. Due happening early still new virus doctors around world scrambling figure best treatment isolation methods, know best methods use keep infected hospitalized succumbing virus. rest nation, world, benefited trial error, still contend deaths period uncertainty skews numbers higher.
3. Medical supplies, PPE, Ventilators, critical items short supply stretched limit. Medical Staff contracting disease hospitals running low manpower well.
4. given governments acted faulty/ short sighted/ incomplete information CDC pertaining nursing homes lead major outbreaks hundreds deaths.

We eventually get situation control probably chaotic stressful weeks region since 9/11 (but far deadlier course), government commendable (though without criticism) efforts keep virus control ever since, we've lowest new-case-counts nation late spring summer SE, West Coast, Midwest seen explosive outbreaks wax wane period time.

Lately, case counts trending upwards, least look worldometers numbers. We've 200-500 cases/ day summer, lately numbers gone 400-700 cases per day. Could temporary blip, colder drier weather coming shortly, need stay vigilant another wave. don’t excess income. literally definition working poor. Even excess I’m never going billionaire. may able help people small ways won’t able help poor. 

“I’m rich yet” probably never be. people truly wealthy inherited it. system designed keep exactly born. needs exploit people survive. Don’t buy “you become next bill gates” bullshit. shit far between. you’re making six figures almost guarantee there’s someone getting fucked able financially support family you’re directly indirectly. Whether it’s US different country. cited four source none supports claim 70% Covid-19 patients (symptomatic asymptomatic, according you) suffer heart problems.

Please show source actual 70% number refers Covid-19 symptoms  denialist 

I deny people get heart problems Covid-19. said non sources support 70% claim additionally said end number probably 10%. That’s pretty impressive! know quite people who’ve infected. Scary definitely fun. husband super lucky get symptoms, too, best jobs stay distanced pass along don’t know. 

Stay healthy! go university Wisconsin, UW Madison positive covid rates 51% fair, they're also faking lot numbers, 160 million tests came back less 80 000 confirmed cases? largest country world virus originally started?

Yeah bullshit. Get supplies together now, remember cleaning supplies TP gone. second wave coupled contentious election horizon. Get shelf food, freezer, paper goods cleaning supplies ahead horde. I've making disinfectant pine sol distilled water. super cheap effective. worst day life far bit Simpsons. course. Lol. 

Ok, bud. actually worse take account went expecting shit show, pleasantly surprised ""handled well"". SMH voted crook  connect dots?

We didnt even go lockdown here, didnt need to.

government took extremely seriously. thought country bad. 1%.  Ridiculous much school going likely pay fight court. Nobody wears masks Iowa. many deniers thinking real. report number new cases deaths much want. Nobody knows anybody else dying. want change peoples minds here? need daily news casts showing ACTUAL infected sick, LOCAL hospitals. actual people dying. actual people died it. news. Every night. open eyes. Otherwise... Nobody going listen.  Note wear mask everywhere always . context alone room, would feel comfortable removing mask entirely, whatever feel comfortable with.

I always completely alone gym. trainers, customers - one. guy/girl outside reception (separate floor).

I think I'll get one 3-layered blue surgical masks allow little better breathing, time, offer protection. way confident enough remove mask outright. Reddit filled CCP sympathizers unfortunately, 80k cases clearly faked number, especially country virus literally began. mean brain fog symptom many things.

Go ahead. lockdown. See happy shiny ""herd mentality"" is. Lots places done that. Good thing dead can't answer surveys happy are.

EXCEPT THAT, Mrs. Lincoln, play? make happy? Mine called algebra 2/trig bit uncomfortable, big deal. Well US spends 1.8k Germany per capital. said, quality education better there. see break public versus private education position look (at work), fairly certain US private/for profit schools Germany. skew per capita amount? observation seen amount money education go almost yearly basis. quality goes well. quick example, went mostly DoD schools. one relocations go public school TN 9th grade freshman. teaching things learned 6th 7th grade. late 80s. someone fat I'm scared death catching virus shit, fat doctors! endocrinologist put strict diet dropped A1C 6.5 5.3 (now within normal range) lost 55lbs. dress size started diet. Come on, doc, get program. works! personally know two people died &amp; 50 infected, many requiring hospitalization. Please think affected personally real &amp; scary. Nonsense. 

It's uncomfortable, sure.

But negatively impact exercising way. Finally headline correctly attributes cause. chain failures. us kids cut cord would add cable bill back budgets service. yeah, father neglected flu young, got serious complications damaged hearing permanently
I agree neglect covid, cases one proof putting hundreds millions people extreme poverty worth it. discussion measures taken fight covid take cost account right, know people downvoting you. scary fact is, dig deeper see virus making way prevalent among rural populous now. No, expecting 50000 per day currently around 6000 think want anything, want [something]

Anyways... two participants serious illnesses, one MS, one transverse myelitis, often precursor MS. MS auto-immune disorder. vaccine negative effect someone, likely auto-immune disorder, due fact vaccine altering body's immunological response systems. 

 Astra Zeneca vehemently claiming person MS already disorder, caused vaccine, two participants serious side effects, would likely end bid trillion dollar prize.

There excellent article new york times explains article claims Astra Zeneca's disclosure rare one, one typically happen vaccine trials. Usually vaccine trials shrouded secrecy. course reason initial post. People might leary vaccine forced upon us rushed market. 

 Oh, also stringent time requirements vaccines, usually 10 15 years. due complex nature auto immune disorders could arise vaccine. sometimes takes many years disorders worsen point diagnosis. time requirement cut almost completely out. One major corners cut vaccine. Found [this googling, looks similar study showing negative correlation covid deaths flu vaccinations looking areas Italy.

These authors say unclear whether flu shot effect, whether correlation getting flu shots better begin with. moron, hes UK. Read article. Well question many tests asymptomatic people. really know many people virus. CDC thinks somewhere around 10x confirmed cases. Probably less testing. thought here, might empathetic realize. news lot take people naturally care quite bit people. know relevant you, okay shut doors while.

Almost like forcing people isolation months end wasn’t good idea. politicians level headed response proportional danger. Yea pretty sure every year going worse last point civil war part deux states looming. Yes, even worse consequences imo forget Texas. Yeah.... pay college / university prices remedial classes. isnt exactly true. lot hospital big cities swamped insane degree.

&amp;#x200B;

The government massively suppressing numbers. multiple cases district level administration literally threatening private labs reduce number covid tests shut lab. government isnt reporting suspect deaths patient dies reports come in. cluster fuck ground level. 

Also, lot poor middle class people afraid labelled covid patient shunned socially going get tested. I've heard anecdotes many people entire families developed symptoms go hospital get tested. 

There also huge disparity reported deaths government data cemeteries. good news classes levels schooling worthless long term career success. virus people? normally symptoms things like stroke brain tumors, heard loss taste figured might like hard taste sick anyway, smelling tasting things normally huge red flag something wrong brain. Dude drink bleach /S (please don’t drink bleach, also don’t anything Trump recommends.) support BLM, get shot every black person gotten it. no. sounds delusional.   SlingTV offered plan without FoxNews. bought it. However forced add lawsuit. India trying race USA 50 million isn’t don’t know. literally don’t know covid kills. It’s theories. best thinking help spread? Sweden infrastructure preventative measures without lockdown. saw happened NYC lockdowns. It’s tough lot people subreddit. response fact shutdowns drastically hurt economy without shut downs, economy worse people won’t engage don’t feel safe.

This clearly isn’t true, time time again, see open economy, people engage it. 

So make excuses this. current one Floridians naturally dumb. doesn’t matter case everywhere economy opened. 

So need narritive explain aren’t wrong economy. Apparently one they’ve decided there’s something Florida makes people really stupid. 

Apparently easier reason admitting they’re wrong. US looking like entering 3rd wave increase cases. Although depending look it, US never really ended 1st wave, plateaued while. got virus something August 2019 laid month, took 6 months feel shaky walking around feel like lungs functioning right. Also weird heart stuff I'm sure whether that's gotten better. know much virus changes due lifestyle changes fact exercise month, man sucked doctors see anything wrong. months fatigue comes back bit year later. Like, thought muscles atrophied useless could still pick kid stuff true weakness. near useless whole time.

And hear post COVID fatigue, sounds way worse had. That's terrible. People take illnesses seriously America (I caught mine something went around office, people come sick anyway, despite work home easily). That's we're mess, country macho attitude sickness ever get us down, go work try impress boss even though give raise anyway. like support, may kindly suggest joining us r/stopdrinking. Right, nationwide dispatchers. 911 centers nation. 2million issues? getting from?  time covid denial denial. Academic outcomes (GPAs, Standardized testing scores) consistently lower among poor minority demographics.

There fairly large body evidence college entrance exams (SAT ACT) racially economically biased.

This really controversial stance anecdote someone defying odds that, anecdote.

Also, daughter rising senior (class 21) reading tense right, correct? Lol; well first that’s may alberta way better. Second actually read article say Albertans it’s 36% still vast minority. You’re selling like *most* albertans favour really it’s 1 point something national average per 1,700 people. 1 5 national, 2 5 Alberta.

Next, article references talked people Canada- means many Albertans talk to? Since don’t say, assume it’s 10% since 10% country Alberta. talked 170 Albertans 1500 others... wonder average slightly higher Alberta? frankly almost Calgary seeing it’s Calgary sun. Calgary is, I’m reading now, right leaning rest Alberta... surprise they’re willing let people die them?

Anyway, long store short, poll garbage, tiny actually meet sort scientific criteria, doesn’t list info actually needs order make informed judgement means, you’re still racist. 

I’m sure you’re going go again, I’m going ignore you. Racist. Yeah, dumbass said watterboarded bad, offered done prove that. never did.

Appleton weekend. many Trump signs everywhere went carry order restaurant social distancing followed Houdini's Escape. Maybe 5 non-employees wearing masks, one bartenders wasn't. includes people waiting seated. [Sixth lowest positive test rate Reducing OP's argument ""wearing mask"" disingenuous. simply wear mask, yet life could remain normal without restriction, absolutely right. However, OP clearly talking *all* restrictions stress we're under.

It sucks pregnant this. wife son weeks pandemic really hit country. can't understand stress going through.

That said, high risk people (multiple health issues, elderly) susceptible almost every virus today. look flu. children, flu lethal. (IIRC) 45, flu COVID-19 same. 45, COVID-19 gets lethal older get. concerned flu? not, not? there's vaccine? learned live flu?

Regardless, shortly vaccine available all, mortality rate drop even now, herd immunity rise. COVID-19 become like flu terms mortality. seems heavy-handed ridiculous keep existing restrictions place point.

And admitted, ER fee waved realize that's charged astronomically, right? equivalent ""inspection fee"" waved find something really wrong car dealership.

Also, $300 cited co-pay day pay. cover extra fees, results reading mentioned post. receive bills things covered weeks hospital discharge.

Like said, bankrupted rich, poor, well-insured uninsured alike years. folks would argue ""Nuh-uh card says $X, extra bills???""

How often gone ER? still get Disney issues least nothing reported yet. Even believe CDC, since millions, tiny percentage total population

""omg 50 deaths something that's growing exponentially""  really mean anything? bias numbers?

What theyneed select random areas. Test everyone one day every 3 weeks.

## SUMMARY

Development specific antivirals urgent unmet need SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. study focuses host proteases proteolytically activate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, critical fusion binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), antiviral targets. first validated cleavage putative furin substrate motif SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing VeroE6 cells found prominent syncytium formation. cleavage syncytium abolished treatment furin inhibitors decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) naphthofluorescein transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat. CMK naphthofluorescein showed antiviral effects SARS-CoV-2-infected cells decreasing viral production cytopathic effects. analysis revealed that, similar camostat, CMK blocks virus entry, suppresses cleavage spike syncytium. Naphthofluorescein instead acts primarily suppressing viral RNA transcription. Therefore, furin inhibitors may become promising antivirals prevention treatment SARS-CoV-2 infections. Island nations, Australia largest island them.

The good thing going Australia vast distances major population centers. sensible people want drive far, without flights fairly easy control travel. government massively suppressing numbers. multiple cases district level administration literally threatening private labs reduce number covid tests shut lab. government isnt reporting suspect deaths patient dies reports come in. cluster fuck ground level. 

Also, lot poor middle class people afraid labelled covid patient shunned socially going get tested. I've heard anecdotes many people entire families developed symptoms didnt go hospital get tested. 

There also huge disparity reported deaths government data cemeteries. incredibly weird might sound, situation India seem terrifying article might believe, least surface.

Public commutes almost congested used year ago, yet surge cases severe back April. stands now, number daily ""reported"" recoveries almost par ""reported"" infections. Even medical experts terrified second wave early June (The post-Cyclone period terrifying ngl) kinda' baffled much we've held worse explosion deaths, given population general poverty situation.

If stars align, could bruteforce way virtue innate immunities. Otherwise, pleasure folks. Yes, they've defended every one Trump's lies. pathetic watching cult die prove right lying faces whole time. Well morons need representation apparently probably likes people Fox News thinking give easily digestible pieces. also probably likes things believe get mentioned Fox, confirmation bias work. parents way. 

I think also parallels many people approach religion. Reading Bible challenging. Much easier someone pick several passages related, explain meaning you. also providing confirmation God control, God good, trusting God obvious solution (if tempted Satan). Yeah, like refer back quote GoT made sellsword noble family (no spoilers case) schools ancestors cutthroat like able get power keep it. I’m UK, I’m fascinated history. comment true, though applies across politics general, well. US famous marvelous job handling AIDs generation taught competitive superior. Collaboration option long time.

Look us now. Naw....count calories. cycle chronic overeating cycle need break. Fucking lol another disingenuous statistic. better chance surviving invasion Normandy D-Day, surviving COVID infection. murderer, need start calling people such. “Tolerance unity” doesn’t mean tolerating absolutely everything uniting absolutely everyone. seems obvious. South Korea (still), Japan, Indonesia Thailand.

Truth China dealing much higher extent massive population, disinformation outbreak first began, source origin virus itself.

I mean, neighboring 1 billion pop country receiving blows blows even immensely strict lockdown, yet China A-okay? No, said literally cutting corners. better lockdown even harder then. Boris Johnson catch it. almost died. went told everyone stop working home ""eat help out"" help restaurant sector. tried murder. Right, one vote like us... ugh.  mean initially pretty high force social distancing everyone culturally accepting masks/social distancing greatly reduces risk. 

From remember, people really accept masks India culture touchy canceled cable 20 years ago would sign this. admit lies disinformation spread government, skeptical, conspiracy theory way way supposed question everything. news, 70% plus heart issues knows long. Yay, team! Jackass Rand Paul called *”community immunity”* sounds catchy... “I'd embarrassed American point, beyond that, I'd embarrassed even attempt defend it.”

Believe me, don’t. getting second stimulus check? go outside take strolls, alone way meditate declutter mind. always wear mask, maintain distance people, someone says hi, wave back them. mental health fine. social life, still text FaceTime friends, feel safe meeting like old days. say know happening here, say one possible explanation observed study. Wait what? man volunteered tortured? stop coming anytime fucking time Something hilarious illegal, reckon. [Paradox spoon feed republicans everything really muster enough brain cells cursory google?

Anyone wanna share they're preparing winter? Good info food stock on, recipes? generally good advice prepping might worse winter spring was? We're victims bubbles, one way another. key aware bubble, guess. scientist...If take 4 would cancel out, need take uneven numbers positive effect.

1 3. Lol can’t believe people brush saying testing people. Like Jesus that’s happens case numbers go up. Shit going hand people default believing pleasant/convenient them, actually true. ah shit explains couldnt find it. thanks. enforced strict quarantine measures early locking whole city physically forcing people stay home. experienced dealing flu like outbreaks SARS/H1N1 etc People quoting two weeks one tested admitted hospital, average 8-11 days onset symptoms. south started spike cases, people tested even symptomatic. Ounce prevention worth pound cure. Seeing somebody whose otherwise healthy start gaining overweight/obese category Doctors probably feel easier/more likely change habits avoid issues, versus morbidly obese person far stuck cycle bad habits already issues could avoid. course morbidly obese person needs change more, likely lot mental baggage weight Drs time deal with. average person suffering lockdown redditor doomscrolling r/Coronavirus daily. Betteridge's Law applied - ""Any headline ends question mark answered word no."" Im actually saying late - Ive benzos 7 years now.....shit Houston, shows hospitalizations way down. Maybe good news us. jitna bhi tum jor laga lo Yeah pretty much described. I'm like literally every person know started gyms gets-togethers people's houses. hoaxers, people could longer justify staying sequestered absence crisis numbers. numbers get bad, people ratchet back down. success rigorous mask-wearing, social distancing, 

So naturally away that. wish media would stop reporting Fox News like legitimate news source. giving Fox News larger platform allowing dominate news cycle. Here's informative hack gap exists. stems old disagreements dominion Skåne. Right. generally annoyed comment. see similar “papers” referenced media which, even find sources “studies”, lot laypeople don’t understand basically irrelevant due methodology. Pre-Covid would unheard of. ^fuck brain fog? (Recovered) still lot neurological symptoms. Another testimony dumbass. course real stupid fuck. There's proof herd immunity anymore, see case Manaus said 44~66% population serologic positive, yet, already second wave since 2 weeks ago ""Death Zone DeSantis"" nice ring it. actually heard before. recovery time benzos last years. I'm cheering Canada. Hope drunks help. don't, try something else.

Pandemic alone. think US given up.

I think push stopped soon companies branding masks. remotely know felon, confirm, ate like prison, thing. Interesting @ isolation 3 years.  thing people seem care death toll- since majority cases asymptomatic mild, folks attitude “if happens me, won’t bad.” Unless higher percentage people start landing morgues, stand another story guy beat virus. interesting look cases declined testing declined Florida since July. well long, compared neighbors...I feel like matter time, Minnesota surrounded four states shitty mask compliance. US grown past 20 years distrust science, entitlement. Hence infection death rates. mean people arguing efficacy wearing mask. Then, others arguing mask induces hypoxia (a lack oxygen). wear N95 12 hours. move different paces. starting think think mental health. Others train six months ago.

3. winery? I'm sure businesses owns I'm going wiki, bars allowed open outdoor service. think places serve alcohol open all, that's hypocrisy part AFAIK (unless better explain point). People get flu shot also likely follow self-protective guidelines (masks, distancing, etc) lower risk catching either one. live Melbourne, Australia. Population 5 million, similar Wisconsin. peaked around 750 cases day, went hard lockdown couple months ago. 5 cases per day today. start really open 3 weeks. can’t imagine 2000 day. devastating families. Yeah, (not all) times stories like they've got ""no underlying health conditions"" obese. one trust people less willing take it? People say lives matter economy realize lives **are** economy. *economy* measure human activity, people things keeps essentials life flowing.

-_- snobbishness. Choosing wrong homophone mean person lacks critical thinking skills. fact, post you’re mocking actually challenging authority saying way demonstrates critics thinking. Spelling grammar matter, think people dismiss valid points someone misspelling typo typically saying thinking person they’re mocking. Trump's response disaster. entire country US failed miserably managing pandemic. shameful. need go public spaces can’t mask.  Wow that's even remotely close. You’ll probably see coming lmao r/actualpublicfreakouts put perspective, places country positivity rates 3% - 6%. reported accurately, pretty crazy. would much less suspicious, political motive rush it. potential December approval, however. **ELI5: European COVID-19 restrictions light compared 1st wave, daily infection rates double?** ship international vessel crewed entirely Phillapinos quarantined contact community per usual.It third time international ship come Western Australia crewed covid positive non Australian crew.

However, FHM declares need movement restrictions, happen without constitutional change. Need take lead back Wisconsin. ahead case. So, Point Roberts essentially America's Northern Ireland (minus history terrorism). Manaus stupid. 

Mask, distance, disinfect, vaccine done. 

The incredibly high majority people able live completely regular lives this. no, Go MUH rIgHts!!

I met coworker yesterday beer said 9k died covid (citting really poorly done CDC release) talkin masks dumb, flu, covid regs stupid. Give ya 1 guess votes for...

I swear feel like covid talking him. want return live like covid? wear mask disinfect shit. life mostly unaffected unless catch it. 

take care yoruselves guys. Good health, good sleep, good habits. Thats go really long way. wait long.  One week cases start skyrocketing, 2 hospitals start complaining overload, 4 death toll spike upwards. drink smoke, never never will. guess ""substance abuse"" choice video games, however find filling free time between. gym, yes gyms open EU, gotta make appointment.  

I miss fiancée sex lot tho. gonna get depressed that. lockdowns. death count speaks itself... need even touch testing longer. look Hong Kong, ca. 1997, fact similar situation. easily give chunk land citizens away. give dual citizenship special status, offer resettlement, sign papers. 

What good primo land cannot support economically? enough. even statistic? many places, testing supplies still scarce, people symptoms tested. Agree. 

This depressing think about. hope grow up, logical intelligent guardians... holding breath I've watched many bad parents handicap children various ways, either laziness, case, negligence protect them. Makes cringe thinking it. 

At time, many types adults would made far without protections modern society.

It's inevitable entropic processes (in sense biodiversity) come victorious point... meaningful change measures? mandating masks, closing parks major holidays, daily briefings stating importance bringing numbers down, effect? There’s repercussions

Strictly speaking that's true It’s #3 list still three months You’re really grumpy pice shit huh? mainly going hurt poorer students honestly believe nothing done 

It hurt poorer students, yes, live very, affluent area rich students hurting too. mostly US. many countries, cost foreigners health care nominal. example, read one account injured American going Japanese ER shocked cost treatment hundred bucks.  huge amount territory US's meagre contact tracing effort mobile tracking programs Taiwan South Korea, territory require changing constitution even erosion civil liberties.

Where at? city, legit 3 weeks straight checking every day, multiple stores, find roll. lol. numbers could high studies suggest. 

They could, could even higher, making sense talk could be. makes much sense talk is, namely reality made selection bias claiming 

Really? 
I showed you, studies, pick Covid-19 patients randomly, preselect population severe enough symptoms go hospital, germany emergency. one goes hospital little cough even asymptomatic.

The second study picks people symptoms bad enough warrant echocardiogram, again, get one like that, reasonably ill even wait weeks months get one.

The studies talk patients really sick, sick enough go hospital get echocardiogram. far asymptomatic.  *shrug* Hell handbasket. Huh, radiating passion Point Roberts aggressive response. Care fill us in? 747 seats 400 people, 4 per flight catching Covid-19? doesn’t sound good all. Louisiana. small towns even wear mask all, including clerks.

Think terms US election- election underway- even though happened yet smart. Yep. heard 750 million people mandated quarantine China, started preparing US. Knew real spread fast.  loosely translates 

""We really gonna look employees loosing much money, wanna re-open."" Test kits developed humans around 90-95% sensitive ! house broken dogs escaping ones pissing floor tbf Sorry, conclusions incorrect. Even asymptomatic cases, numbers could high studies suggest. selection bias claiming. reason believe numbers different general population since talking largely asymptomatic patients. 1 billion people around 100,000 deaths.

So right India around .00008% chance contracting covid killed it. 

Numbers lie. Patently false. Try again. That's figured, hoped something else. ""Nabes"" so.... eeek. can't believe really used that. 

I saw someone recently use ""yt"" shorthand way typing ""white."" 

Oooof. energy. Unfortunately correct, half people take it, vaccine work. half community unvaccinated, that's 1 4 that's immune. That's enough stoppage prevent widespread submission covid Capitalist america happier pandemic like this. puts overlords WAY ahead schedule. Noice Well, you’re welcome wear mask quarantine rest life wish. don’t expect 330 million people join fat people always calling healthy? think covid-19 become politicised management social vs economic argument. there's constitutional / liberty issue conservatives have. There's also mistrust effectiveness evidence-base mandated quarantine / lockdown etc. immunity infection immunity disease. There's good chance vaccines prevent getting sick spreading virus. Also 100% effective, FDA requires effectiveness. Could vaccinated still picks bar kills grandma. 

From first add investigation needed “carefully examine  existing prospectively collect new data populations  confirm refute findings”. 
100 patients recently recovered COVID-19 illness identified University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry April June 2020.

I heard yesterday germany, 19 20 patients Covid-19 treated practitioners see hospital all, one reasons hospitals stress right now. 
In reverse means, picked people study severe symptoms made go hospital. 
They pick asymptomatic ones suggest.

From second global survey, cardiac abnormalities observed half COVID-19 patients undergoing echocardiography

Not 70% patients Covid-19, half patients underwent echocardiography, vastly different number.

If estimate maybe 10 times people undiagnosed Covid-19 consider fact also included highly probably Covid-19 patients, patients even know Covid-19 number patients heart problems end probably 10%.

That still warrants do, please stop fear mongering. better sorry ass dead. don’t think people understand vaccinations work. get vaccinated literally can’t, crazy anti vaxers legit medically can’t, safe. That’s point. Imagine thinking need wear mask anyone vaccines delivered hospitals soon.

The absolute failure US education system shocking. Yes, scary sad young man, really unusual.

There also many anecdotes people multiple underlying health conditions fine, even asymptomatic. 

And day here, article former world's heaviest man recovered. lost weight still 208 kg / 458 lbs. can't really blame insurance companies denying coverage. risk unknown chance large payout per patient, risks strongly correlated, patients disease. would imprudent insurance companies accept significant percentage clients condition, already many now, none want more.

Insurance works things like house fire. decide buy house, old enough understand need insurance, budget payments. Also, houses never fire nationwide. Try get coverage war damage, get quotes, massive risk correlation. Pandemics like war insurance companies, like fires.

The problem going resolved, drop insurance coverage mindset completely. problem hand fund healthcare. Florida, specifically talking you...

Kind seems like too. wasn’t aware right accusing left ownership problem. ( issue responding ) *Dog turns around looks one day*

*BORK* Downplaying? It’s awful.

That said, numbers numbers. political, reality. surprise one Yeah Roughly 20 relatives developed covid like symptoms. None took test. Tried natural remedies home everyone recovered, years old. I've heard scores stories friends too. 10mil nothing, I'm guess somewhere around 300-500mil

A test costs 4000 bucks, majority population, they'd rather stay home ride symptoms go spend 20% monthly salary per person getting tested. Many middle class people afraid go hospital itself

Given vast majority population young well, tons asymptomatic people 

Initial sero surveys around May predicted 60-80 people went undetected every positive test No, *primarily* does. Even without symptoms, symptoms suppressed regulating immune system. Infecting brains CNS MO corona. We, god help us, begun understand means.

But no, man, came wet market bats. God forbid engage *conspiracies.* Thank responsible citizen. friends China living life pretty much like pre-covid handful masks. Right one best places avoid covid actually China. America always screwed. european, americans laughing stock world right now. can't one hates going weddings first place I'm NH makes feel better. point overload hospital system. “specific” shape curve. Yeah, know. But, makes worse. but...

Being lockdown guyz, I'm losing guyz. hard, never anything hard need travel see people can't anything this, need move guyz. sunshine, er.. self cremation state. next step opening back without worry covid, pretty close now. Covid basically unheard anyone publish crap like this. there’s proper (and peer reviewed) study, ignore article doesn’t clearly state methods gotta special kind person see people killing think insurance stocks. wholeheartedly reject this. Yes, we're part humanity, limits. 1 2 percent people virus truly affecting (especially want take irresponsible risks) get hold rest us hostage. We're vulnerable regardless may feel vast majority us cannot live like forever. that's impossible. can't comprehensive study done long-term effects covid-19 even full year since started, mention health departments probably focused getting cure effective treatment reducing spread much possible. Anecdotes separate cases likely tye best we'll while. seeing increase infection rate cracking pretty hard. Positive rates 1.8% today.

Oh goody, usual pessimism subreddit good for. 50% minimum true enough, know efficacy yet basing assumption worst case scenario.

Secondly, idea immunity last months also certain, relies flawed understanding immune system works.

Finally, seriously think people tolerate businesses going bust, losing jobs give socialising seeing family friends routinely lockdowns world going years come utterly deluded.

Flu endemic, vaccine use restrictive measures. COVID worse flu, big enough margin majority people put disruption hardship advocate. local walmart took basically signage stuff wearing masks &amp; distancing couple weeks ago.

I remember pretty big kerfuffle months ago walmart ""supposedly"" going start requiring masks, take long anti-maskers figure could ignore requirement -- couple people decided it, probably something like half people store decided wear anymore either.  Agreed. I'm fearful treating kids scary effect them. Since March, example, another kid comes onto playground, left playground prevent contact. know there's virus, know another kid comes play them, time leave SUPER unfair. Currently Covid-19 kills rate 200,000 - 300,000 people per year US, many dying already bad shape. much worse WWII, WWI Vietnam Korean war measured deaths unless look inside overcrowding hospitals, barely notice it

Doubt. *chuckles floridese*

I’m danger Florida first go extinct. like mass land fucking disappear did. far headline disagrees position.

No masks, social distancing. love disingenuous attitude restriction mask wearing. 

Ignoring lockdowns enacted several countries, social distancing, limits meeting households general disruption peoples lives. gave slightly less ridiculous thing say world's media :) Hey, Madison good whole time Sorry burst bubble, vaccine end pandemic. fda LOWERED standards said vaccine needs 50% effective order approved. Immunity last foe couple months. everyone gains immunity virus. restrictions, masks, social distancing long time virus become endemic. virus disappear instead us way flu is. sorry fed false hope. officers patrolling lived, caught outside escorted home. hiking trails, got fined. yeah, stopped going outdoors. Thanks! think high idiots make self's highly visible. Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Mongolia, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka etc etc (it's long list countries) vast majority population exposed disease almost fully eliminated say hi. gyms problem close gyms, really hard breathe properly exercising mask ever said this, anything like this, year.

Because pieces finally here: inept leadership, economic disaster, run-away money printer. We've never before. uncle died this. Yes, underlying health issues still could prudent. socializing important. paid price. info. miss everyday.... thinking earlier today dad, watches Fox news probably 4-8 hours per day belief pandemic political tool used democrats. 

My thought was: far tell, never disagrees anything said Fox news, ever. I'm surprised never occurs ""hey I've watched literally thousands hours nodded along every bit it; maybe signals I'm really thinking it"". occur point I'm pretty confident never will. think feels comfortable safe worldview everything simple, solutions obvious (if blocked libs!), bad guys clearly identifiable (anyone who's Fox News republican). So, really flu bro? 

^(sarcasm) Well, guess ferrets solution. dream standing meat counter one, including myself, mask faces. lost shit. some. flu season I've ever experienced killed million people six months. Kinda big difference. innumeracy sociopathy takes happily justify unnecessarily killing millions truly depressing. Yes, think so. LIfe needs move on. check data [here:](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=Florida&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right#states-normalized) Ditto (although 45+ years me) - however, also never referred Brooklyn &amp; Queens ""suburbs"" (or similar cringy ""burbs""), apparently thing, assumed touch. know people socializing outside point, safe. Driveways, backyards, etc. people started going inside house now, getting chilly evenings. Oh fucking please, doomsday nerds saying past decade. Exactly way without mask. Here's daily reminder mask up, practice social distancing, ignore conspiracy theorists fear mongers. That'd great works.

I already take two acid reflux allergies. First time damn things actually useful. Everyone age 2 wore mask, didn’t mask yelled employees unless sitting designated spot actively eating drinking. lines also looked deceptively long simply everyone spaced much pretty much entire line outside well. public health student really surprised well handled honestly felt safer going Walmart back home grab groceries. Also get would it, redoing splash mountain winter making princess frog themed. Yes, 👉 [the Automoderator that's comments precipitated pandemic Ah, old bad apples argument. Love it.  That’s capacity exceeded. capacity numbers watch. it’s capacity, care remains same. vaccine? Never.

With vaccine - maybe good effective enough enough people take it.

So never. kid(s) - air fryer + small freezer. know *healthiest* solution, online school chaos, sweet potato fries, veggies chicken nuggets, etc. damn god send.

Plus he'll actually eat them, that's bonus. Ah, quick change subject, fickle, grasping straws? Point stands: Sweden cannot introduce lockdown, neither whole city countrywide, someone wants it.

And looking Spain, France, UK, big lockdowners, well ... Nope give average Americans much less credit ppl seem assumed. say everyone going wearing masks.

My point I'm pretty sure I'll see Americans wearing masks test life. think Trump deep knows he’s going lose election big “F you” us Americans. Here: So? sure numbers looking past 2 weeks Florida doesn;t indicate surge happening worry abolishing electoral college soon, benefit dead soon Natural herd immunity among humans theory. That's scariest thing herd immunity tactic, outside vaccination / innoculation evidence herd immunity even possible humans. many old sick people die yearly around world colds flus? anyone ever gave shit before? follow government media tell too. Never without vaccine (it never happens nature disease alone - see measles, polio, smallpox etc prior vaccines invented) even that's iffy depending effective is. Yeah that's said, I'm considered obese. Source? Yes. need stop saying things like “pandemic causes students fall behind school”

Wrong, response pandemic does. Whether cost worth debate, need stop pretending it’s magical property covid closes schools - plenty nations held models left schools opened. Yeah, dare encourage people go live lives, rather hunkering fear virus 99.5% survival rate! Thanks laugh. Nice scenario likely far reality. Welcome every state union. Commercial cooking uses lot rich ingredients home cook wouldn’t think use. seriously know this? Even U.S. crapped bed many ways, think behaviors at-large changed enough widespread exponential growth going happen. packed stadiums concert halls. places may get bit something extreme, part we're going see gradual increases people unsafe contact other. point numbers deemed bad enough local government put restrictions place again. 

In way would relief swing big surges total lockdowns. would unity. stands, we're constant arguing line drawn, tons people slowly fall victim disease. Hey glad able good time family, wear mask, enjoy Disney World. 
I bet awesome without lines crowds! Last time there, years ago, took quite hit rides family looking get on. 

How look there, nearly everyone wearing mask Disney trying clean everything? feel like making serious effort ensure safety guests? Unless lot muscle mass, probably obese. BMI accurate general population. interesting, significant implications severe minor cases. Thanks sharing. something’s hard do, it’s worth doing. - Homer Simpson. guess million average? person thinks worse Sweden did? like 10 years Swedish kids ones permanently developmentally damaged. rest world might even end similar death rate (USA already higher per capita deaths, Denmark's curve creeping up). time tell guess... Let families decide risk take not. Telling people aren’t allowed see families disgusting. that? wrong. Check daily new cases graphs clearly downward trend get plasma tho That’s ok even covid. know! 😭 Illinois surrounded fucking idiots, we’ve 3-4% weeks weeks. ""elders"" saying closing borders prevent pandemic, fact mean epidemiologists writing papers pandemics early 2000's? study see long COVID-19 particles stay air people left room? much danger compared to, say, coming direct contact infected person?

The reason I'm asking it, go gym completely empty, ~1 hour last person left. wear thick (non-N95) mask, turn exhaust fans sides on, always sanitize hands every machine, NEVER touch eyes. air-conditioners on.

However, couple times, need loosen mask bottom ~1-2 seconds gasp air (usually wall fan). 

Is enough precautions, basically use good going gym people it?

Thanks! tho close eyes, danger goes away! Easy! Ooof yeah got swine flu early teens fever high hallucinating basically incoherent sick blob good week lingering cough long time. bueno.

I think DJT really drive home notion pandemic way out. He's beat head relentlessly, spins right, message would be: ""hey, yeah, virus bad, look, we're starting vaccinate everyone, world open back soon, we'll really races"". Dude, ribeye posted looks amazing.  hospitals overwhelmed. would news not.

""But about!"" pathetic argumentation base, additionally. /r/AGrimDystopia? Ah old ‘keep science church’ approach cant dumb.  I'm tired keeping wave we're currently heading towards. Fuck corona. I'm sure sounded smart head, still failing address issue - claim variables future projections unknowable (which definition means, could end horrendous), basis justify lockdowns?

Or think put everyone house arrest arbitrary indefinite periods time satisfies emotionally? inviting death

Life invites death. team also developed first working corona test. That’d true 2011 bud.  Yes survival rate Spain way compared before. Good Shhh... shhhh.... obama's fault. There's virus. Biden socialism... ticking testing plateaued. Translation: ""I'm special snowflake got caught."" 

Bye now; go back shithole bridge. we're talking see posted 27th didn’t see today. Sorry. Right, soon medical workers get it, gonna much harder spread. yes. alot people think turns new year, automatically get ""a new fresh start"" Really? even little? mean we’re even quarter way yet, vaccines getting emergency approval soon next 6-8 weeks. skin colour, rather different genetic makeup. People different ethnicities tend differences range something metabolizes different risks disease allergy. important test different genders, important test people different genetic backgrounds. really skin colour thing, also important Black people represented, also different genetic makeups amongst themselves, anyone else. pick under-represent ignore huge part humanity. 

The people tested merrier either way. data look at.  Isn’t what...the Phases for? thinking way 5 Scream movies erase concern elderly parents abstain indoor dining establishments they're bored stay home.

Why feel need control parents? wish dangerous activity, stopping them? Yep, got lot idiots, too. least government tries listen him. Cases... called police dispatch business owner masking sent officers out. Island Hawaii, people still taking seriously. 8,200 tests ... meanwhile New York 100,000 tests per day. SARS-CoV-2 acts like HCoVs (no long-term sterilizing immunity) herd immunity pipe dream. Every place proclaiming herd immunity woke pipe dream pretty harshly. Latest hopeful candidate : Manaos, Brazil. even corrupt prez realised that, outlook must quite grim. sure Babis would qualms sacrifice number x people like brought country back normal. Western leaders realize wont. cant state openly would make obvious people pesky asians laughed spring right start leadership gravely misjudged everything.

But whatever like country. watch experiment across (then closed) border. fairness Florida concerning... elect Chancellor let lead country 16 years call Mutti (Mummy).

Unfortunately retire soon coming going good all.

I dislike much politics, god respect her. need log reddit days, dude/dudette. Very. long actually vetting. they’re Republican Q-moron front group hurt black people. Everyone restaurant choice. People allowed decide what's acceptable risk. Lol want segregation. Cant make sht Theoretically, perhaps. schools open around world months, America weeks/a month. op said every time open school proven disaster. want examples. high school outcomes large part decided socioeconomic background, I'd board saying.

But do.

And 22 anything sneeze at. Looks like [a quarter LA high school grads hit 57% hitting benchmark English 18, Science 23, 2 22. So, perfect data, gives us good enough idea reddit conversation. 

Clearly 1/4th population able graduate college, clearly scholarship set weed able graduate. 5 years prison $250,000 fine shitheads like this. know it'll never happen, dream.... average person. Keep mind, one hotspots driving NYC's increase Borough Park, 50% seroprevalence April. 20% herd immunity groupies need find new narrative.  Rising states. hotspot testing issue... havn't hit flu season yet blew lid 1918.

It's even lack leadership issue.

If NOTHING, we'd get without him.

It's constant misunformation, hijacking CDC rest half country following footsteps right cliff dragging half them. thought headline news India (in English language too) intentionally counting COVID cases among migrant workers, government said ""simply data"". unknown millions cases dying road temp residence.

Apparently headline news India. Reddit knows nothing magic turn pounds yeast tons yeast? else turn? good power have. turns 2021, mean virus anything takes break.

Wait, anyone actually think this?  average person able get 7 weeks. even close.  Still first wave. Feds ordered 150 million tests lab months ago. Last month trump said would senior care homes. apparently plan give like three million governor, coordinated plan even data collection, pretend that’s going make schools safe, don’t open blame (democrat) governors. viable heartless people thread think millions deaths god knows many irreparably damaged lungs acceptable loss thing need know sub almost one slightest clue economy. 🤦‍♀️ 15-20% baseline. live Texas get it. It’s pretty nice getting ass blasted Louisiana 

However getting ass blasted property tax least control live. president done African Americans like wrong direction Flu IFR Buddy think daily cases Florida gonna go up, got bad news you. keep hearing [wastewater covid method employed place detect outbreaks. granularity zip codes, case colleges individual dorms. 

What **haven't seen** publicly shared numbers. Countries, states, counties, cities world covid-tracking dashboards sort, giving result individual tests, deaths, hospitalizations, etc. get see wastewater numbers, too? course give accurate human count, what? gives another number work with. want see it. RIP florida. mean he’s wrong, rapid tests shit... agree that’s literal promise comes president, might well say is. 60 million end 2020 presidential term

See math too. looks like 22 bit average 57% able hit subjects. government’s point view sending average students college deal likely pay considering high drop rates. consider way much risk transition?  Reddit kids, dependents. would need leave grab xbox Mountain Dew they’re way. Bubbeleh.

It's absolutely haredim gathering large numbers prayer, crowding yeshivas, completely flouting health restrictions. anyone tries apply rules rest society, scream antisemitism drop hat.

This cult ignoring laws decades, aided abetted politicians refuse anything exchange inaction, rabbis ensure votes. agree human nature. also agree concept hivemind greatly manipulated marketing messaging. messaging administration take seriously. leadership got early, could better long term outcome, even possibly fewer restrictions. could gone people know interact mostly liberal (liberal state, liberal metro) fatigued lockdown started traveling, gathering small parties, eating out, shopping leisure etc.

Very anecdotal. agree disagree one. point think woman singular nutcase rather typical example African medical training. worry money dead. Well proper information given out, Trump DeSantis spin shit badly can’t expect people act rationally. media cycle works. We've lot Trump drama, election drama, renewed protests. media always tries stay new people lose interest hear covid time. cases start increasing ton deaths start increasing bunch we'll hear again. Ok saying rolling bad? that's point ""herd immunity"" people pushing define it. scenario, people still masking, people still distancing, people still working home cooking home instead going bars restaurants. short, *soft* lockdown. point ""herd immunity"", proponents describe it, *explicitly infect many people possible, certain percentage die*, survivors get back ""normality"", preferably election. 

We talk science-based concept herd immunity steadily reopen masking distancing limiting outings. people actually pushing herd immunity want people die save economy. That's rich coming person missed point several times, could make snide remarks things say. I'm gonna make /r/coronavirus bingo card. 

Baseless Spanish Flu comparisons would great square. Lmao first comment

“World hunger over, ate today!” Low intelligence + low education + zero problem solving logic skills. pesky asians laughed spring 

I doubt specifically CZ SVK laughed Asians back March, fact, eagerly copied - ones Europe. 


Shame continue (especially Czechs) Businesses care reputation. would useful ton different situations Based. Hopefully people thought flu vaccine would painful drawn ordeal saw decided bad. takes 10 minutes Walgreens depending busy are, free health insurance. think costs like $40 insurance. can't admit COVID actually least order magnitude worse circulating diseases prior it. matters immensely. Genetics.

If examining medications response across genes potentially putting people risk inclusive trial.

Skin color, ergo ""genes"", lot efficacy safety vaccines. ;( Interesting pleas universal health coverage thew context much want care people's health considered ""too political."" hell! started infant closed wing daycare. immediately made staff go get tested that’s found 3 staff members positive. immediately shut entire center 14+ days. didn’t show negative result, anyone (2 kids) positive result share result. even IDPH call us contact tracing. can’t believe child’s daycare would put everyone risk like that. I’m sorry. another party 3rd. I'm kidding. wish were. guy red looks like guys Jersey Shore combined one. called someone earlier thread heartless feel death old person death young person. arguing think terrible feel way, think people feel way whether admit not.

And response shooting, reality would deeply effected 5 year old got shot face. defense, US nasty history performing cruel experiments unwitting black people, even long ago. can't fault distrusting medical institutions. Daily COVID deaths could single digits Fauci would still complain we're enough. Stupid comment. reckless. RIP Go back read question. must missed lart said people going riot protest restrictions. expect people put them. Stop projecting opinion actually read saying. created boogeyman mind think not. said comments ago advocating lockdowns. USA hurting response, exporting covidiotism around world Florida renaming Retardia? left bad right comes this. Yeah, proving right. clearly informed lot what's commonly understood virus. So, complain people worried it. someone can’t get C+ average high school going flunk college hard. you’ve even see students high GPAs fail, clear throwing poor, academically disadvantaged students subpar grades wolves recipe disaster. Among literally everyone know, including people COVID, I've never heard anyone complain government enough stop virus. I've sure hell heard plenty people say government much. Lmfao wow you’re deranged! won’t refute you’re stupid can’t go around murdering people argument doesn’t deserve response that’s idiotic is. It’s bad faith argument. didn’t refute argument climate experts screaming 14 months ago going die didn’t something 14 months?? Well guess what? it’s 14 months later exactly nothing fucking happening we’re gonna die. we’re gonna die 50 years hundred. fearmongering lies won’t work here. Stop stupid lies. saying believe right morally correct thing nothing attempt shit character virtue signal think you’re better somehow. It’s blatant transparent. Get high horse. You’re gonna shame people want, you’re gonna manipulate others around unless others around you’re completely fucking stupid. responsible exactly one except myself. want protect cool it, lock basement next two years. Idc. keeper I’m mama. that’s want better go home mommy get fucking pacifier fucking crybaby. arguments senseless baseless. deserve zero minutes attention. You’re arguing bad faith know it. Go try manipulate someone weaker.  volunteer states balanced budgets written laws / constitutions.

It's good idea though.

and republicans pushing sort thing federal level, Okay well remind two years, guess I'm tired pandemic want get die it. Given kids easily carriers like adults, precautions required. would advocate someone breaking isolation endangering people, kid? “I’m outside” Illinois property taxes higher New Hsmpshire blows mind quickly people forget.  Here’s refresher need.  funny, I'm CA I've seen lot FL plates recently I'm wondering that's going new trend. People trying flee virus states conservative virus? MILLION 25 days. Less month.

That's assuming linear progression/transmission. Which, depending R0, may well be, particularly places widespread reopenings like Florida. R0 2 would make number exponentially higher. There's two three forbidden virology topics sub, pretty much get banned anything else unless egregious.

r/COVID19 joke though, they'll ban breathing. Unless believe stupid version herd immunity theory. 
Who would guessed anyone would write full blow article?!  Luckily english language. Makes way harder produce believable troll content. Still exists way less english everyone training world wide. I’ve last two years university ripped away, job prospects gone due travel bans economy crashing, haven’t seen friend 8 months live across country/world, nothing. There’s manipulation here, destroyed supposed best years many others’ lives. It’s super easy people families, careers, jobs, houses, lives say ‘just sit inside two years’, much you’re spending money online courses take solitude next year. Might well charge Cuomo manslaughter 2x many deaths we're it.  even trying argue? 

When old guy shot face Facebook live response ""well would tragic child.""? Except shift like two generations. Tuskegee ended ‘72. Plenty redditors alive nearly parents Wear mask leave home, minimize interactions others, symptoms get tested quarantine yourself. That’s advice. disease serious need work community reduce spread. 

That said, please come back 3 weeks mock following:

FL new cases (running average):
Oct 5: 2200; Oct 12: 2100; Oct 19: 1700  problem people reporting number cases per day many people think meaningful sense waves. America never left linear growth. It’s moved around country severity: NE, Upper Midwest, SE, West, Midwest. Nationally daily growth cases hasn’t gotten 30,000 sustained period time. needed get 10k consider first wave over. 

This like tsunami that’s slowly growing sea everybody going clamming onshore. statement refers North Florida, clear way worded suspect people get annual flu shots likely health insurance, likely primary care doctor, actually see primary care doctor regularity, chronic conditions treated. many socioeconomic factors correlate getting flu shot would also beneficial preventing serious Covid-19 infection. die soon get it, take several weeks? Yes accounts. [are sure leave. People Texas getting really sick California expats Curious, worth it? Insider trading yes, also hold stock options companies 80-90% right. Thats good enough. Imagine pregnancy test rate accuracy carry sure, us go back socialising vaccine. ""Just mask ignore fear-mongers, move on, think economy."" Funny feel way California. still labeling people died causes infected / covid covid death? stage, hesitant believe either side regarding figures opportunistic election goals. Hospitals love numbers increased funding. Republicans short virus saying maintained ensure election democrats say dying second get Trump office. 

2020 truly fucked year many accounts. like 1984 Brand New World rolled episode Big Brother meets Apprentice.  new strain Covid resisting hand sanitizer masks. vaccine cure this. scam time claim increase positives restrictions relax people pretend nothing wrong isnt cases, testing...

It’s exact bullshit early summer cases kept growing hospital beds kept filling people kept dying kept saying well it’s testing, things got really bad told us behind us, continue lose hundreds day. mean, I'm forcing go outside approach me... Florida re-opening full capacity bad idea, states really need start thinking allowing restaurants operate in-doors capacity winter going kill lot restaurants. lot people going comfortable eating outside really cold rainy weather, without in-door dining capacity, lot restaurants' sales going suffer many probably go business.

It's easy problem solve, needs least recognized leaders need start thinking reasonable solution tries balance public health economic fallout come winter. It’s potential Covid vaccine. black friends told they’re getting year’s flu vaccine, asked why, cite experiments why. They’re always worried stuff like that. It’s like they’re crazy people talking ass believe every stupid conspiracy hear, objectively speaking, they’re well educated, successful people. 

Every while, something like comes them, reminds privileged never worry sort stuff. businesses always choose money health consumers 10 10 times. Man, who’s charge schedule? ""Every business right operate,"" DeSantis said news conference Friday. 

how every individual right infect/contract people deadly virus. 
this guy seriously worse covid took moment hopped high horse would realise vaccine likely end pandemic.

The pandemic uncontrolled spread virus. need eradicate virus end pandemic phase. get numbers managable.

You're still delusion people keep lock step measures, last couple months highlighted general fatigue population restrictions growing receding.

Medically keep measures sometime vaccine. Socially, expect measures abandoned second people start getting shot.

This virus 0.5-1% ifr 40 region 0.2%. pathetic think numbers like mean abandon freedoms live misery rolling lockdowns restrictions years years. I'm sure logic works here, carry on. Two doors open makes crossflow. let room closed doors. 

As airflow fresh air, probably blow air somehow without making cold.

There might heater duct outside sort kind heats outside air.

Just thinking loud.

For single room, never doors open. Two better one. know fresh air though. guess they’re trying say 2% equal 2x1. Vermont’s new cases “doubled” 3 6. increase bad, control, state setting 200 testing sites areas. Yeah, kind of? mean difference negligible 2 random people like 80 year difference 2, one murderer one humanitarian, big difference terms tragic opinion. deployed, right vote guaranteed. duty polls open, guaranteed able leave. might say mail ballot, would make sense, especially since schedules change drop hat. 

Just letting know rights Service Members put lives life us guaranteed them. really disgusts me. 

I could go rant, that’s sub about. RIP. Literally.  consistently short. takes time spread get rolling. Many people still reasonably careful. don’t think cases significantly impacted Halloween earliest, though school impact

Depends Europe took around 2-4 weeks get ball rolling (aka people coming back vacation, caring masks etc...)

Have im mind many areas northern hemisphere getting colder again, people stuffing closed rooms, adds top! get from? know use mask? throw shade her? It’s depressing people love judge others, even don’t know don’t know facts. lived Australia 20 years always went Asian countries travel. NZ always list. wonder masses Aussie tourists NZ set travel agreement?  lock-downs big impact death tolls. example, flu numbers way due universal use masks. Death traffic accidents way down, too. Let whatever want. See happens. Wow... guess listen executives. 

They’d never lie us. Right? Holy fuck trash Sweden, government taking different approach countries

Least restrictive ""very people continuing go outside, travel work meet friends family.

As pretty much every single EU country, although understand idea seems super scary people completely succumbed start Covid-19 pandemic one strategy suppressing virus proved controversial tactic: herd immunity.

Yes. Although clear, strategy controversial achieving herd immunity *through natural infection*. Vaccinations also result herd immunity, good thing, I'm pretty sure every single country wants Despite tough criticism experts governments around world

Mind Sweden chose go path

No, didn't. main strategy Sweden is, always been, flatten order avoid locking economy.

No didn't. reason Sweden chose strategy takes health entire population accord. Lockdowns also consequences public health, pretty severe ones controversial approach meant coronavirus cases deaths country initially skyrocketed July daily figures dropped dramatically, country successfully keeping infections deaths low months.

This sentence implies initial deaths somehow *caused* strategy necessarily true. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe stricter strategy would avoided some, given there's plenty places higher death rates despite lockdowns, maybe mid-July deaths single figures, whole country faring even better Victoria.

Uh multiple days August Sweden recording case numbers double digits, numbers jumped weeks September, authorities struggling understand why.

No they're struggling, local outbreaks expected stage Daily case numbers remained worryingly high ever since, 1700 new cases recorded past week.

No one really worried, since hospitalizations deaths continue really [bla bla Wearing mask also optional residents.

Fuck authorities considering bringing restrictions deal unexpected surge cases.

Yes, still [bla bla However, study published August found Sweden actually ""failed"" bid achieve herd immunity.

How convenient, single study confirms bias writer article. Welp, case closed, everyone Sweden going die two weeks. good knowing you.

August.. Oh, wait, ""article"" written retired doctor something unrelated, economist? looked deaths June, despite two months data? declared, without evidence, deaths still high June, Sweden herd immunity? article? Eh there's never global natural disasters Human history. two global wars happened tend refer casualty rate percentage global population.  Modern transportation made spread lot faster would past... would want us continue short vaccine likely 100 percent effective. would wait new cases reported virus dies out. can't imagine would take long vaccine that's fairly effective. airline Exec says... Yeah course Trust you. like job, bonus anything else depends it. know number 4. China, development vaccine COVID19 all-encompassing, number 4 meaningless.

Eleven vaccines tested China, four entered Phase III clinical trials.
Five technical routes inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, adenovirus vector vaccines, attenuated influenza virus vector vaccines nucleic acid vaccines deployed parallel research development. ""At present, vaccines technical route entered clinical research stage, 11 vaccines clinical trials, four entered phase III clinical trials. recombinant protein vaccine, nucleic acid vaccine attenuated influenza virus vector vaccine pressing ahead Phase II clinical trials.""

""At present, 11 new coronavirus vaccines China process clinical trials, yet licensed marketing used vaccinate general population,"" Yang Sheng, deputy director Department Drug Registration Management State Drug Administration, said.

Zheng Zhongwei, head Scientific Research Development Task Force Working Group Vaccine Research Development director Medical Health Science Technology Development Center National Health Commission, said: ""China made thorough layout production management vaccines. According current estimates, expected end year, China's annual production capacity new coronavirus vaccine reach 610 million doses; next year, China's annual production capacity new coronavirus vaccine reach 1 billion doses. Yes, unfortunately virus stop youth. spread family, friends, rest community ...if strapped missile. expected given amount anti-maskers whatever reason, still don’t get it. Anyway, let spread amongst see happens. like Herman Cain literally die stupidity. It’s you. ain’t going anywhere near morons. can't really give chunk land 1000 American citizens Canada. say. Canada say. also primo land Lake Woods Alaska fairly useless comparison. So.. likely less civilian suicides? I'm sure also quite substantially. world sleeping Australia's success since start month I'm perfectly fine that. Plenty working Military base UAE... WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY, keep losing wonderful people? Americans ain't got enough brains sustain hungry hoard zombies. u uncivil ? say false positives ? u rude offensive ? 5 u Texas “25 percent capacity” maybe “50 percent” 

But truth told 100% got second wave got fucked.

Now Abbott trying get rid mask policy it’s going thing Infected contagious. False positives extremely small number results. dilusional? covid scent? Domestic travel also impacted. *""Chinese tourists make 3.4 billion domestic trips 2020. figure 43 per cent year year 2019 tourism statistics.""* Obligatory fuck Tavern League. angry tweeting red carpet welcome within minutes stay home order struck down. bullshit ur mom want point everyone reading indication part vaccine approval process US shows signs political interference. top public health experts still confident transparency process far. Exactly time average person gets vaccine, front line workers several months. Technically that's already. mainly taking precautions keep 1 percent vulnerable people dying. Florida decided pandemic opt-out option.

There news. De Santis woke up, called press conference announced new fuck shit policy. What? First, support policies, wanted mention are, still think countries wore masks that's it. 

Second, specifically brought laws reference surveillance. Mandatory mobile tracking (as Taiwan South Korea) would require constitutional changes lot Europe. understand read saying better testing requires law changes, definitely mean that.

Testing massively important, think that's problems Europe/US now. mostly ability stop community spread local targeted interventions.  % without numbers means nothing Experts? need experts tell this. people listened experts first place, pandemic world control already.

You need certsin dumbass high position get attention dumbasses, cos certainly listen experts. Avoid benzos costs, highly highly addicting make matters much worse. Huh? spike WI began 9/19. week ago. not. 10th Amendment, gives states powers specifically given federal government, allows authority take public health emergency actions, setting quarantines business restrictions, including wearing mask public areas. Sounds like something Dicaprio would do, little snitch He's space legitimate scientific principle well-known copiously studied viruses, neither apply COVID-19. Sorry, mobile wrote erred sake brevity, type exactly like reading anyway. Jesus. I'd ask effing kidding today's US?

Jrsus. Common sense dead. Fear new flavor, friend. 

There reason young healthy locked down. 

As downvote this, remember: covid I'm sent back work keep y'all safe. precedent disruptions Katrina caused major consequences.  one responsible infecting anyone, happens magic. wonderful 'real world' live in. begins again! prove got Covid specific bar exactly? you’re trying argue people never rose high school barely passed that. education lack beginning show bad ways. It’s embarrassing. last time? 12% tourism international though. China fine without 1.3% GDP. Maximum capacity never overreached. logic super simple:

Sweden bad: SWEDEN BAD!

Other countries bad: SWEDEN'S FAULT! SWEDEN BAD!

See! Perfectly logical! cunt trusted isolate flash hotel room free food, makes think could trusted self isolate comfort home. one. criminal deported australia. would guess even home. Hed couch relatives hence self isolating I've learned Covid-19 deniers, U.S. risk group.


About 40% country qualifies obese. war would preferable social isolation Hey least don’t Covid right?? Right guys?? me? asking care people killing ultimately it’s choice whether not? mean dosed? not, that’s pity. far mark. whole reason toilet paper shortage rumor started Australia spread globally. Simply saying shortage xyz products causes people panic buy, even products normally buy.  Meanwhile Florida, people stopped taking covid test numbers would go down. state local government opened everything canceled mandates.  enjoy vacations here, keep taking covid back midwest friends. seem happy it. unironically probably heading Australia deported raise awareness though, steer Titanic away misery / BBC-Extinction facts  
is also fantastic, hour, many experts, shows avoid 
future pandemics overall better planet depend Lol fact anyone even believes China 21 cases absolutely ridiculous. people even report them? kind staggering think whole ordeal far -- March -- may preamble Gross, one drinks corona I'm sorry, I'm western whats snowbird? decided withdraw semester work, hopefully thinking I’d able experience things waited spring. I’m confused. long must wait? I’m depressed want know see friends live young life again. Also guys act like wearing mask social distancing sacrifice, I’m essential worker now, can’t party drink people, go clubs, see friends, fucking go class. cover fucking face sweat work. shit sucks :(. fact referred legitimate scientific principle ""faux"" speaks volumes. couldn’t isolate comfort home? hell *this* okay? Y’all begging get rights taken away... division US today worst lifetime

Yep. guys basically States America. United long gone. get tested twice days 3 12 isolation case picked covid transit. number cases meaningless? people it'll spread people much easier. Like commenter pointed date changes two charts linked around 4 weeks. look places surged earlier happens faster. Early on, people quoting 2 weeks evidence shown. treatments improved stat became date. Shhh! Remember - Russian Due *lockdowns* No. take legislative change test better. no, neither would take changes impose certain restrictions based clear data. restrictions would even necessary good testing.

You're fatalist. People like we're stuck situation still. Tested positive necessarily infected. Infected necessarily sick. Sick necessarily hospitalized. Hospitalized necessarily ICU. ICU necessarily death. 

So course check numbers still remain calm. Calm decisions good decisions man tested negative allowed isolate home? Fucking tyrannical psychopath Havent hit economically anyways? setup number call see American plate, Canadian border services come escort back border needed. Measles scares shit super duper cool Measles Vaccine Non-Responder. I’ve 4 full rounds MMR vaccine absolutely zero antibodies system showing resistance virus. Measles outbreak area, I’m screwed. destruction? China known exists 10 months. Thats truth people say. like Voldemort think there's world catch this, wrong. I'm getting it, federal employer cheering covid. I'm going back work minimum ten days (plus two weekends) off, Thursday. 

We going exposed. That's fact. sounds terrible! I'm sure USA, South Africa go pharmacy (drugstore?) get shots. friends babies take cheaper, staffed qualified nurses. Hope find alternative little one! living now? worry decisions people make say matter. FHM recommended complete restriction movement within Sweden, currrent law allows government so. basis ""forbidden due constitution"" argument. 
Unfortunately, FHM hires nutjobs like Tegnell initiative frontload deaths first months years long pandemic. Meanwhile continues promise herd immunity Stockholm may, June even late August promised herd immunity. 

No one else n Europe expects ""herd immunity"" vaccines administered least years time. 

The Swedish construction excuse murder elderly. numbers aren’t useful without qualifying tests done. you’re testing people death beds, you’ll get higher positivity rate state that’s worse also testing asymptomatic people. It’s unheard covid “long haulers” neuro symptoms last months months. I’m hoping Democrats win stop playing defensive. shit Republicans done 20 years. Stop treating Republican Party legitimate opposition. Legitimate opposition doesn’t sacrifice 200,000 people “the economy” also mismanaged. sidestep them. Admit DC Puerto Rico states, Republicans can’t win Senate. that, may never emerge party again. What’s defense going time? sane person takes Fox News seriously? USA TODAY analysis shows state’s positive case count among kids aged 5 17 declined late September peak July. Among counties seeing surges overall cases, it’s college-age adults – school children – driving trend, analysis early results Florida show success rigorous mask-wearing, social distancing, isolating contacts, quick contact tracing necessary, said health experts. CDC leadership longer relies science, mean. corruption malfeasance comes white house damaged CDC. This. care facts. I'm really sure Wtf want facts. networks reported truth. correct never RNA vaccine approved human use. 

That’s part reason financial stakes high, many pharma companies trying make money hyping news stories despite working product. mean TRUMP STATES right? honestly, lets say joe blow get vaccine easily february-ish say May everyone done best practices control past command future.

Those command future conquer past. That’s true. multiple issues society. wearing mask fascist got car accident years ago. Went get checkout. Started talking sleep, work, stress doing. Read, well. Got small script days absolutely needed sleep. helped much. able get good night's sleep. Ah, thanks info! u Well, kind happens ignorance. wish could say feel sorry guy, considering might spread covid multiple people symptoms showed up, say DESERVES IT. mean yourself? LOL

No. makes think I'm expert infectious diseases?

As rest... I'm taking every precaution. feel sorry future Americans. going bad. locking hard resulted shorter lockdowns then. Even New Zealand lockdowns fight flare ups. sure people get idea “if everyone listened wore masks would over”, especially country like America huge, interconnected, necessary making world economy (on real scale things matter like food production) function. Sure wouldn’t 200,000 deaths wouldn’t going football games concerts without mask either. feel like it’s economy creating environment people believe science afraid go polls. plan. We’ll see resurgence team red members decade. number deaths 300,000 March 2021 shocked. already 200,000 that’s 6-7 months in. Without breakthrough treating vaccine majority believe safe, fucked. like gamble, said over/under US 1 million...I’LL TAKE OVER

much doubt Yup, got Canada too.. That’s works Godspeed weird side note: trees least upper portion VT/NH magnificent. I've never seen white pines tall entire life. white pine backyard thought huge (~60 ft). learned grow 200ft. eyes focused sky everywhere drove. miss trees. ""B-b-but kids going get infected, bring home kill parents grandparents!"" Sweden actually takes care people, get away without bankrupting every citizen. US that, ignoring death disability, would large proportion population buried hospital debt never pay off. Yep. take vaccine gets pushed administration least 6 months widespread use. Ship California that. literally teased vaccine ready ""a special day"" like thought promo shitty reality TV show. insane trust him, CDC FDA done catastrophically poor job protecting independence integrity they're much better. confident vaccine data reviewed independent experts and/or health authorities nations competent leaders respect science. reduction restrictions Michigan. I’ve never frustrated. know plural anecdote data, three close friends teachers around Orlando 75% kids still virtual. Even classes 30+, they've got maybe 5-7 kids person. Unless reinfection happens high rate, prior infection complications make higher risk. things possible. Since much long term data recently started confirming reinfection despite suspected long, can't say likely unlikely is.

In months might realize ""at risk"" populations grown exponentially well. remember article early June said ""Florida reopens surge cases"" .... \*sooooooon\* Except cure covid19... appreciate someone admitting wrong. It’s bit frustrating comes late often he’s putting subjecting ridicule warn others commendable. think China cares reports fake contact tracers robbing people trying get personal info. Can't trust anybody days Yup, there's huge difference skeptical vaccine approved FDA election vs election. I'll watching resignations see Europe says. Even commands aren’t ships enforcing extra rules. can’t leave 100 mile radius work. Finally stationed coast family can’t even social distancing get together bc 120 miles away. hope feel better soon. Might be, also possible got virus time somewhere else kid developed symptoms faster.

But yea, probably got kid. Even seems like kids spread much, still spreading virus. joke conservatives unironically appropriate pro-choice “my body choice” messaging push anti mask agenda Recover fully? article says 56% lung damage remains 12 weeks. know goes zero eventually. Also, huge percentage people lung damage months illness crazy. yet another piece evidence ""just flu"" crowd. follow-up cardiovascular changes inflammation.

Yes does. works great.

**Step 1**

- Government: ""We need scapegoat level proof justify something, evidence.""

- &lt;government waterboards person, says whatever government wants make 3**

Sad. 50% immune R cut half (at least, likely even reduced since infected contacts negative).
To get Rt 2 50% immunity need underlying rate R=4 possible course also sounds high. 
But guess populations small takes superspreading events get almost R locally. Way prove point misleading information. 

The 94% survival rate applies aged 70 over. current breakdown follows:

0-19: 99.997%

20-49: 99.98%

I believe main difference US Europe Americans generally unhealthy European counterparts. could name 1000 reasons Americans unhealthy know all, public/limited healthcare, extremely low minimum wage leads eating fast food, walking possible many areas. could go on, maybe American COVID response slightly harsher. think happens Africa. I'm Peru epidemics they're kind isolated cases, often far away poorer regions. Tuberculosis concerning illness here, kills hundreds every year. However coronavirus killed tens thousands. Unlike tuberculosis, overall rare cause death, coronavirus hit close home us.

I'd say probably Africa care virus given low infection. elsewhere, specially Latin America, quite traumatic event. retrospective epidemics look like child play compared coronavirus...  dad should’ve paid bills, mom should’ve bought insurance, it’s fault sister made poor choices statistics don’t back claim higher chance killed police. president doesn’t appoint Supreme Court justices, nominates them.

That's true. bet watch WH briefers almost never mentioned governors besides saying ""that jurisdiction states."" ""right leaning"" media still criticizes certain aspects lockdowns - Cuomo's putting sick people nursing homes instead hospitals Whitmer letting people drive second homes rural areas north Michican. legitimate critiques, even think Trump ever critiqued them. think mixing Trump media. someone mild symptoms please describe cough? small cough every minutes feeling something stuck throat? chronic cough? here, honest initially surprised low Covid-19 dimensions lethality contagiousness realized that's kind problem - Covid-19 seems deadly contagious enough major problem also dismissed way inclined. people smart enough calculate loss quality life. 

A 1% quality life loss US would equal 330 million x .5 years x .01 = 1.65 million years life quality lost. Multiply whatever percent think actual quality life lost.

Now compare years lost COVID. high estimate average COVID death loses 10 years life. 200k US deaths = 2 million years life.

Basically think quality life dropped 1.3% life lost quality reasons rather death reasons. He’s wishcasting. Fuck that, I'm gonna ""show papers"" - that's dystopian fuck lot folks sick vote.

Texas shows low active cases managing higher number deaths California. think depends sort social distancing measures place.

assuming measures place - e.g. max X people house, max X people work, hanging bars etc. - winter could actually mean less transmission, people generally going less, fuck cold. they're gonna stay home little social bubbles.

however, absence controls, could well mean transmission, people socializing indoor environments.

It probably hurt masks become thing Western countries honestly, like Asian countries. anybody feeling sick, either cold, flu whatever, starts wear mask public that, would beneficial public health. like wearing mask around people feeling sick big sacrifice anyway. don’t think someone who’s tested positive extremely stressed needs read horror stories people severe cases. look numbers people died COVID 19 *alone*

y’all love rushing pessimistic media viewpoint whole mess [According 450 million cases pneumonia every year, every year 4 million people die. EVERY. YEAR. None ever cared it.

Rich old people started dying developed countries, misinformation caused lockdowns economy works funnel money automatized global multinationals 250 million people falling misery risking starvation. mention hundreds thousands going die form lack medical care. damage caused draconian measures far far worst virus everyone blind it. Lol! back jurisprudence. 

You can’t psychosomatic manifestation  less .02% global population.

If measured every natural disaster wars world percentage global population, might well say nothing happened.

You're basically saying since global human extinction happened, disease nothing.

I get point showing danger disease global percentage odd. people significant others?

What people apart signficant others distance protect family community?

However, agree point there's reason punish yourself. definitely agree that. seems anxious want right thing, really appreciate that. agree, response joke shoulders fix problem yourself. certain point maybe month ago, realized let go pretext would work hard mentally make morons think hoax we're overreacting comfortable. give single fuck wife going remote schooling, working home, various stressors all, care they're hurt go XYZ party cause know either people they're inviting want get row masks election whatever fuck is.

Many people family, close friends long ago. act self-care advocate people care let chips fall may. future humanity fucked take everyone know. either ignorant evil. works great prior after. Obviously fraud can’t read studies liar wants people die. Link article next time, trust headlines. journalists clickbaiters now.   Hillary: don’t get elected we’ll hang nooses. 

And could provide quote going jail Junior?  Agreed.

If shenanigans continue, unfortunately let go. :( Um. sounds like personal problem. introvert life - identified probably 20. know introverts aren’t oppressed class lol. one telling anything don’t want do. You’re one randomly went needing social interaction. you’ve really got victim complex down. 

Reddit wild. Locking could served two purposes. 1) either lockdown long enough reinforce medical system set robust test trace system 2) cities could wait actually facing curve like New York, lockdown crush it.

We picked worst possible worlds wasting lockdowns...if number 1 didn’t happen, fucking stupid places like Kansas City Dallas lockdown time New York, blow support lockdowns, open face “first” wave point, Florida 400,000 ACTIVE cases.

Doesn't much matter many cases Florida June. interesting New York California worse terms deaths, yet subreddit zeroes Florida's policies. Severe COVID-19 complications incredibly rare among young people. young people hospitalized probably medical conditions prevented serving military even COVID. reaction Covid-19 absolutely disastrous. anyone think good idea copy way China handles pandemic? China country committing crimes people almost similar something saw '40s. Never ever reacted way virus, done either. way, excusable countries cautious beginning beyond self-evident virus primarily targets elderly, desperate need different approach.  


Does mean say throw elderly bus? No, means stop using one size fits strategies combat virus low mortality rate. Age stratified lockdowns could solution, however, elderly freedom decide want visit grandkids themselves.

Secondly term 'excess deaths' labeled media deaths could avoided reality every country suffers excess deaths time. instance, right Europe's excess mortality around [211 (as see graph constant since April). sounds like lot go five years back see Europe's excess mortality even higher, [217 (Also Euromoro article Danish CDC). Lars Kaiser Danish Ph.D. professor public health put way "" ...doctors health experts gone openly able talk excess mortality among elderly flu season sudden change narrative experts courage speak out"". Translated read article propose every country follow sustainable way; Swedish model. sensible constant restrictions constantly switch lockdown reopening lockdown again, businesses close 24 one week 22 another. want small medium-sized businesses survive cannot continue approach anymore. However, one question still needs asked; go Swedish approach see many deaths?

This question easy understand, compare attributed deaths due COVID, Denmark 650 deaths Swedens 5800 deaths. comprehend difference big must understand difference Denmark Sweden comes nursing homes. Denmark (and Norway matter) resident nursing homes 32 months left live. Sweden, [16 COVID came hit nursing homes lot harder Danish Norwegian nursing homes residents noticeably younger.

Secondly, Sweden actually experienced excess deaths 4 straight years 2016-2020. means COVID came simply killed elderly die [previous flu Compare Denmark, 2 years ago experienced tough flu season, resulting 1700 excess deaths [among get back sanity lets get back sustainable way fight virus, owe children, mentally ill, small business owners struggling harder ever come by. Guess Canada/US borders opening anytime soon  never extrovert type, seriously months working home living alone starting exhausting. isolated free time work time draining while. lol start think... Two friends died Covid, age 40 prior health conditions. dad's nurse survived ventilated 6 days, permanent lung damage age 28. like bring charcoal lighter fluid gotta burn fuckers case procreate dead. Get better quality friends.... Yes, agree extent. thing ways fun without putting others danger. Note self. Recheck news 3 weeks. there’s return normal? Don’t @me, hypothetically. Vaccine partially effective, without social distancing 2,000 Americans die every day forever.

It’s lot. Okay it’s old people mostly, lot Well sure, mean people society decide that, fine. what’s really happening, people forced things don’t want do, matter whether empathetic not. central issue really freedom. People free choose want situation, forced compliance mass hysteria.

Edit. Upvoted civil conversation. Thank you. easily prevented zombie apocalypse, like month found diabetes drug cures infected takes week turn still overwhelms America people like pharmaceutical companies raising prices diabetes medication 10,000%. Yeah, that's true all. Well, I've never known extroverts lot sympathy introverts. fact, controlling pressuring introverts seems makes extroverts thrive. thanks. “It’s cough 

that carries off.

It’s coffin

they carry in.” wear masks still stink peoples bad breath commenting. masks designed single use only, never reused. It’s grotesquely bad practice. yet anti-vaxers vax measles. governor shows concern spreading virus hell pay Trump. Republican governors kissing ass parroting words, including governor. Last week TV big plastic smile telling Trump, ""Our economy booming!!!"" No. It's. Not. Really?

I heard lot people talking 100 million earlier year. predictions uncontrollable would rip world's population 2% fatality rate.

Personally thought (in February/March) would 10 million now. Australian here. already felt sorry Americans. Lack universal healthcare, many states ""at will"" employment laws, lack federally mandated maternity leave, vacation time etc.

And Trump this. Sorry American friends :( high rate suggests actual number cases higher reporting. example 3% positivity rate means testing lot catching whatever comes up. 25% positivity rate means probably testing people already suspected cases; probably tons asymptomatic cases catching.

It provides second metric say apples apples comparison one situation 5000 cases 3% positivty rate 5000 cases 30% positivity rate. ""Farewell adieu fair Spanish ladies..."" Killing many people fast compare COVID first wave Spanish flu, least winter's over. Get yer TP now! He's talking global scale Lot stories like this. It’s bizarre. If.. know? I’m “obviously looking scrap,” I’m sure getting that! tried polite straightforward wording, even asking aggressive. actions came wanting fight, gravely misinterpreted.

It make difference immunologically. Vaccinations allow people get less serious side effects, whereas going natural infection higher chance adverse side effects, order keep down, spread slowed keep happening rate overwhelm hospitals. podcast called Week Virology (TWIV) discussed stuff like multiple occasions. highly suggest everybody check out!

Anyways, it’s back work me, day choosing! are. close 600 ICU Canada early April. Today there's 100 countrywide. many conversations end lumping older kids / young adults category early elementary school kids. Someone starts talking distance learning far extremely hard effectively young kids, someone else starts chiming experience online classes college. 

My son Kindergarten last year, way could expect ""take education seriously"" even understand implications skipping school. Even school shut March, hard time getting go school morning even though well class teacher said happy day. wants play, developmentally strong grasp schoolwork important long term. Even time resources support fully, distance learning consisted hours tears, whining, convincing get work. Actually first publication two authors third chemist expertise epidemiology. Also doesn’t help it’s non-peer reviewed journal. stop serving alcohol 10. places still open food. Well, know people long term effects virus (especially fatigue organ scarring) going scale months, curious percent people issues especially permanent part. link discussed neither things, thought lot ""may"". hoping something concrete. wear helmet walk across street? not, playing odds drivers actually stop crosswalk. eat cooked bacon? not, playing odds increased cancer risk affect you. wear mask every flu season pre-COVID? not, playing odds might catch strain flu covered vaccine, small risk dying result.

Everyone plays odds, time. to, order live. ...because (correctly) categorized ""workplace canteens"", meaning on-site places staff go eat. specific cutout Parliament. Really doesnt matter restrictions put place, massive spread schools wont change anytime soon Yeah, might going straight hell (at least that’s Evangelicals know told me?) I’ll good company! Sex, drugs &amp; rock n’ roll! Woo! crash course workings immune system, help understand current discussions happening society T-cells, antibodies, herd immunity, whether reported cases re-infection real not.

This mandatory reading r/coronavirus able comment immunity antibodies. Well, least U.S. isn’t place dumb people politicians... can’t force things back normal want be. actually get virus control. Otherwise people aren’t going go live lives normally. also culture increasingly values feelings facts reason, often point discussions shut case make people feel uncomfortable.

I think 100% reason. Maybe there's much lead water too, idk, culture disgustingly kinds anti-intellectual attitudes often come within academy, giving paradoxically intellectual veneer.

There's actually war raging Universities right now. happened ""soft sciences"" given title ""science"" honorarily (I'm unfair ass soft science majors. Soft science literally science.) soft science majors want colloquial opinions non-objective things regarded fact. made point make strategic enemies hard science departments disagree them. Living delusion can't last forever, going eventually end soft science programs, like humanities majors, losing credibility overstepped boundaries long. ""Common Cold"" -usually- caused Rhinovirus however 4 circulating strains Coronavirus cause similar symptoms usually thought ""Cold"":  229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1.

Source - young child bad ""cold"" years back, respiratory testing panel revealed dual infection RSV -and- Coronavirus. That's similar latest numbers Florida. Florida 50% people, though. Ontario lower positivity rate. government barely run enough tests test symptomatic infected, potentially exposed people, high risk people, let alone run population assays. don’t think country running random population assays regularly. realize running random population sample assay pretty hard pretty expensive right? Depression sadness. Sadness emotion. Depression leads death. wouldnt understand unless yourself. terrible. trade Ena Respiratory? black white issue.

Obviously not, fundamentally restrictions justified way environmental ones. Operating business like indoor restaurant bar carries pretty heavy negative externalities right now.

Obviously businesses going lost, structural unemployment occur, restrictions carry set negative externalities need provide support well.

And certain things high positive externalities allowed continue even added negatives (in person schooling, particularly K~5 disabilities).

Letting thing run course people scared reducing socialization stop elective surgeries (after initial pants caught early spring situation) unacceptable. like restaurants bars get hit hard type situation well.

Look theatres open right now. restrictions killing them, Tenet theatres re-opened got kicked teeth people want sit theatre unmasked patrons 2+hours. thing happened Omward weekend lockdowns started.

Businesses gonna get clobbered regardless people necessary protect others, need provide structure carnage. News ~~' COVID Denial~~ Hasn’t Aged Well Unfortunately science often political precisely people like place much importance politics situation. [See letter random scientists urging Pfizer hold data weeks can't stress enough asinine ask wait weeks release data post application. Pfizer would learn nothing new waited 3 weeks. letter entirely political.

If Pfizer feels confident assessment data October dissuaded presenting data. government agency middleman consumer science. Yet are. Yeah, knew someone really looking forward rapture. Believed 100% what’s happening country “God’s divine plan action”. He’s dead IDK...hope worked him? people interested science, least two studies saying cross-reactive immunity enough prevent Covid infection :""Prior infection seasonal coronaviruses **does prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection** associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome children"" ""Pre-COVID-19 humoral immunity common coronaviruses **does confer cross-protection** SARS-CoV-2"" Jury still whether cell antibody cross-reaction reduce symptom severity not, probably thing immunity. I’m employed qualify stimulus since make much money. I’m good, thanks concern. 

How’s stimulus treating Canada? Oh that’s right Canadians never got one. That’s lowest # we’ll see remainder year. Check back month new record high set! Houston, bullshit. p100 next person nose exposed. change grocery lanes since want catch stupid Ok first ever attempt, I'm expert, I'll share plan.

Happy discuss DMs additional questions thoughts want bounce someone. 

Good starting process!  Yes, isn’t going away overnight locking things virus people probably survive top knee jerk reaction even though goes subs narrative also blew there.

I think reason honest belief free democratic society could erected dictatorship, probably partially based succes model marshall plan WW2.

The particulars vastly different though looking back naive think would work. 


You could argue though worst part iraq war itself, aftermath, doomed fail start. Whether means US intervene course still remains question air, arguably non-intervention also morally reprehensive, even vastly better international stability. failed, policy *intentionally* returning covid-19 positive patients nursing homes (sometimes without telling homes positivity) free beds early on. obviously later proved massive mistake ""I'm Ron DeSantis, approve data!"" Literally vaccine? That's right. Mental health issues lead death dingus.
It's serious issue. serious covid itself. Every news source biased Fox News republicans isn’t Fox News. doesn’t matter it’s actually biased, isn’t Fox, it’s either biased fake. Would great could, everything fucking open forced work person rather work home, fuck right probably accurate.

From basing this? Yo u reject actual study...and pull something nowhere? also happened UK - throughout country, states :( never said vaccine would eradicate virus, stage endemic.

There however difference current set measures like lockdowns, social distancing, banned seeing households, kinda changes made vaccine.

A vaccine would greatly reduce deaths hospitalisations purely us situation akin endemic viruses longer need lockdowns social distancing.

Not mention think people tolerate regularly losing jobs lockdowns, unable see families new normal must rocker. Sounds like like laughing poor struggling people 1. even asking means paying attention subreddit long enough even excuse voicing opinion begin with. Florida shitshow since Spring governor trying hide data avoid transparency costs. well-known posted dozens times since outbreak began. 

You're either bad faith poster someone arrived today. Good grief. bot global scientic community. Sorry go this. health issues covid risk factor for, result, drink limit caffeine eat healthy, come across stick mud going - totally get social dynamic, want explain people, try diagnose give ""advice"" already tried puts stain interaction, like want deal someone who's fun light smiles time. sad feel like proud soldier plowed pain, get treated like begging attention.

I guess keep posting, even half comments supportive, that's normal internet guess. get crap internet. Personally, live NYC everyone distanced wore mask almost everything except grocery stores closed, still epicenter, still get loads hateful comments downvotes write ""hey, maybe lockdown slam-dunk fixes-everything solution"" respond someone says ""if wore masks"" ""yeah tried it, really work."" Like, God forbid observe stuff brain eyes curious stuff works!

It would much harder people nasty real life actually debate points. Good luck!

Hopefully live little soon, BTW! many times people see story play realize virus fact real? Australian pharma company, different regulations. regulatory agencies may require evidence &amp; review testing healthy human subjects, especially method action that's considered novel experimental.

you simply selfish. someone raised improperly proper response form leadership proper instead oh it’s done Easter people wouldn’t position.

I’m personally depressed terms $$ stability I’m depressed many fellow Americans dire straights direct result lack leadership downright purposeful disregard. mean *medical doctor* Rand Paul actively volunteering time fight COVID-19? disproves last assertion too. smooth brained stuff you’re saying available considered safe scientic community, would take it, regardless US agencies said it. virus transmits predominantly via aerosols best tell, facemasks effective reduces virus carriers non-carriers, however 1 carrier confined space amount virus air bound significant.

If entire cruise staff could sleep deck never go indoors wear masks social distance, theyd much safer. Miserable ineffective job, less likely get COVID. whut? Following advice medical expert? Dem der jermains crazzzsy! Don’t know shills deep state, big pharma, Bill Gates, astral demons? Ty adorable mental image. bad day. would definitely help people used downvote button intended for, instead ""I disagree this"" ""This contradicts everything believe"" button. feel like I've made valid counterpoints get downvoted hell. Fauci told us wear masks ..? meant “cue”   bad fucking blew Iraq invasion. anyone actual case numbers this? seem figures article. *”The tests, look like pregnancy test, two blue lines displayed positive, read health worker.”*

Imagine people confusing pregnancy tests lmao Hah right... least DoorDash view Seriously roll eyes see posts sounds like socialism. Natural herd immunity herd immunity infection. Using vaccines natural, therefor natural herd immunity. 

Perhaps intentions rude, future reference saying “maybe read thread” generally considered polite statement. Even better, would comfortable passing bowl around family? evolution, evolution theory proven valid time time again. “Just theory” fundamental misunderstanding science friend college obese religious. suffered fatigue, migraines, aches pains (especially knees), minor depression. would pray. went doctors never found anything.... mean needed lose weight. would drink tons soda combat headaches caffeine probably sugar withdrawals. told really felt like important tried cut back drinks get exercise health. agreed never took steps change except brought tea diet caffeine instead soda.

I shocked understand weight likely cause many ailments (or made worse). absolutely correct. need identify contagious, every single possible infected person. prevent individual going work getting plane would gone infect many more...rapid testing could help solve much pandemic.  Harvard professor epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina explains well: Time hoard toilet paper Bought deep freezer That's still lot virus going around restaurants reopened Friday, major cause spreading. think interpretation overly generous fine. clearly itching scrap probably leave there.

For record agree vaccines invaluable tool reaching functional herd immunity. one denied that. comment state however natural herd immunity impossible vaccine induced herd immunity is, makes sense immunological standpoint. viable solution? perfect solution speed quantity. get result 0.3 seconds. mass produced years, circulated widely. Except false positive rate 48%, false negatives rate similar magnitude. poking. pain. safely home, probably right now. called coin. sell Trump dollar smaller dime size ones, 95cents larger nickel sized one, plus delivery administration costs. Read reply wrong. Whoops! please reference specific report? Youyang Gu’s model predicts US 18.6% total infected, upper bound 27.3% clear vaccine Pfizer approved early use Europe first, still hesitant take Pfizer vaccine America? clear vaccine Pfizer approved early use Europe first, still hesitant take Pfizer vaccine America? looooove moving goalposts. think favor war reasons, antitotalitarian, seeing saddam get power needed get behind invasion Iraq.
I agree saw points. “most people nothing fear” angle promoted Fox true sociopath care well-being others. swim shark-infested waters. stand hill electrical storm. drink untreated water. eat uncooked pork. Maybe would convenient even taste good munch raw bacon time, that.

The chance death slim many kinds risks, still things. play odds comes intentionally exposing possible death. never knew that! I've tried document works. Cheers! compare flu covid, usefulness concentrating singular cases like article. really say anything prevalent severe cases amongst younger people, mentioned even flu could probably write series articles single people went wrong (like father).

Your link also says nothing big risk developing damage is, study 3 patients comordibities, neither proves disproves point Well hope right wait see fair European countries hit scale matched US northeast early on. US smouldered Europe massive decline (and upsurge). UK worst hit major European state Belgium Spain, US caught Italy, Sweden, France etc recent weeks.

1,000 people dying UK day population 66 million. Proportionate national population, USA day like (although situation Northeast comparable worse - New York state peaked around daily toll population 20 million). think virus spreads telepathy. /s Especially it’s uncalled denounce . hope manners better real life issue words - statement posted above, Fauci defines coronavirus specific causes common cold potentially cross-reactive immunity. However, without specifically stating so, common cold assumed caused rhinoviruses (due ubiquitous). clip speaking Rand Paul, clearly speaking rhinoviruses makes sense cross-reactive immunity rhinoviruses coronaviruses.

This gotcha think is. He's talking near future first vaccine gets released. know effective be, availability be, necessary vaccinate large percentage population (good luck that), vaccines suitable certain risk patients finally, vaccine might effective less year. Hopefully, future vaccines improve pretty much everyone get vaccinated eventually. get back normal. happen next months. predicted 0.1% world population said done (7 800 000). We're still early stages tho. I'm one locks people inside homes, I'm one drops nuclear bomb economy, I'm one taking away basic freedoms, I'm one ruins global health initiatives, I'm one plunges developing world back 20 years.

Are sure I'm person abhorrent views? you. 

I hate getting colds avoid future I’m going try. I'm even male. seems uniquely male issue, making far life hit something consider traumatic. Thats actually first time thought FL SD’s lack income tax light covid response. actions begin make sense even don’t agree Anti-intellectualism - ""My feelings real facts."" May rest peace. Cringe knew people weaponizing fake news pandemic would lead to... disaster. Maybe go take dear leader since one put people position. got slammed two flus 2017. took months get back got sick. horrific. 

I function level. hysterically tired time brain soup. I'm holding hope that's that's happening long hauler covid positive folks 3-6 months they're able heal.

Probably less get vaccine keep they're doing. mean he’s wrong. None restrictions benefit college students...it’s fact. College students extremely low risk category (barring comorbidities individuals probably deferring virtual college now). 

My solution:

Open colleges completely, volunteer TAs handle person instruction professor high risk doesn’t feel safe digital lectures. Otherwise social life allowed. 

Arrange janitorial staff clean students aren’t (close buildings intermittently). 

When way. Sadly doesn’t seem give college students paying for. kind validation abhorrent views new deaths according who? When? county still reporting deaths. yesterday, see news places reporting quite deaths.  Apparently. Dear Dr. Fauci, please take person year award walk away.

Minnesota going fast now. county extremely safe months without single positive case. we’re doubling almost every day. 🙋🏽‍♂️ governor's hands talking moves similar Trumps That’s kind whole point Senate tho. significant scientific disagreement this, please state like fact like - could misleading people. better idea: since you’re terrified outside world, wear mask hide blankets forever.

The rest us getting back normal, whether like not. Um, ""un-blinded"" mean find whether got vaccine placebo. 

Do mean actually wearing sort blind right now? Sorry, I'm really confused. know, fucking sucks. Although, I'd like think humans helping fellow humans out. know fair call people later years ""the worst years lives"". Trust, fun getting old, something helped. 

I'm 20 years senior, I've missed important stuff life too. feel younger folks 100%. Personally still think form relationships fun, gotta careful right now. 

Keep safe please. Liberal bats if/when don’t see significant spikes 2-3 weeks Florida, finally start moving fuck this? Ok counterpoint: lockdowns? Asking South. Yeah need plan 6-9 days advance cause don’t rapid tests What's prize numbers go up? keep pushing back another 2 weeks time doesn't? Oh Elbo room.. Ft.Lauderdales finest. Tbh place showed picture mixture scummy, trashy people tourists. Don’t rope us this! RemindMe! 2 weeks Americans wore mask 6-8 weeks, thing would basically gone. That’s it, could done it. blows mind controllable, yet are. really hate living sometimes .. disenfectants

It's thing inject lungs cure 'Rona, right? /s obviously political comment South Korea mask designation filtration similar n95/kn95. know ear loops. Masks labelled kn95 somewhat available US 70% Here’s one easily debunkable conspiracies right, course. things true. neither, matter.

 almost entirely misleading imply causation correlation demonstrated.

In 48 years earth, never witnessed time people many things depressed about.

Frankly, around here, plenty depressed fact lockdown, state alone daily deaths entire countries months. Can’t skyrocket don’t test 30,000 people hospitalized nationally. course, can’t verify county’s number effect national number either. Best luck though. Hopefully county rectifies problem gets back track like vast majority country things declining. nah it's: smh bro shoulda learned code People really stopped wearing masks Wisconsin. It’s already shit show going get worse Let make easier you. part comment disagree what’s best objectively

Do disagree? tantrum makes seem like you’d strongly agree sentiment. sense indignity 

Do disagree? think feelings better metric infection rates stop protecting subject forces greater yourself.

Do disagree pandemic force greater yourself? means tragedy you’re complaining circumstances forced think people.

Do disagree complaint sacrifice primarily benefit others? seems strongly agree that. 

So actually disagree with? tried licking rat see taste it? Fake news higher chance dying drive home dying virus main points post please don’t come door county I’m doctor never put beds hallways that. R/ coronaviruswi PPE shortage ended? talking about? STILL currently shortage proper masks employees hospitals. Nurses cited wearing (disposable) mask days end aren’t enough. Sure, companies independently chose produce PPE rather normal products, post responded pointing White House chose MANDATE production PPE private companies. guess I’ll entertain comment.

You think social distancing - 10 person social bubbles, weddings, travel, class learning ok next 2, 3 , 4 years? 

Imagine high school student, college never gets play school football team. Spends his/her entire 4 years getting socialize friends, school musical, score game winning 3 point shot ..... think fine. 

What adults planning getting married, travelling world 20’s. Going favourite concerts get old. Nah, let sit home half decade still risk community, right? Wrong. 

Like buddy. “my freedumbs” meme starting hit home many people. Yeah, scoffed couldn’t first months - initial sacrifices understand need novel virus warranted. Years distancing 1 500 people (after medical aid vaccines/treatments) might still suffer severe consequences, not. Maybe they're trying murder old people? Hard imagine, know. everybody's cross-hairs 

As American, always laugh little people vassal nations try act tough daddy's around. exactly plan decide happens little backwater problem? remember Kurds right? Keep telling happen name Mitch Dave. Doesn’t matter. Stay fuck inside. CANNOT spread depression. restrictions would lifted Q1 restrictions completely lifted Q3? amazing. 

Facts masks. 

Facts mandates. Yeah death rate extremely small virus infects fast work retail. People purposefully come store without mask flip someone says something it. always spots too. Aside mask always douchy tapout trump shirt pissy look face. politically expedient. Trump fan drives narrative sides. something dumb side reacts everything else ignored. interesting see sides change reporting November/January loses cocaine one suggesting forever. wish simple. Everyone effects life another situation. It’s can’t really pissed lives needlessly lost, horrific leadership around also really struggling things enjoy life massively disrupted many months likely least many go.

It’s like anyone pick one exclusive cause reaction countries good responses free either. Hopefully means current death rate 4% (i.e. 1 25 people get die). mention long-term effects survive. He's called Die Santis reason control homelessness, opioid epidemic, insane taxes, needles everywhere, insane gun laws, mental illness everywhere, rampant forest arson, drug trafficking, literal shit everywhere, *decriminalized everything*.. oh riots.. lots riots. 

Yeah, Cali shining torch alright.

P.S. know Democrats blocked Covid stimulus relief want trillion dollar bail outs Cali New York, right? Exactly. Let Florida burn. like it'll ocean level next 50 years, anyway. Im arguing point, town isnt good example that. basically ""island"" due border closing mainland. second, employees wearing masks wearing properly. total agreement though, don’t expect customer service reps say anything patrons. local Menards security front place I’ve seen actual enforcement masks. crazy sun literally gives us life (and power) yet kill you. do. count blessings fellows hkers take seriously well spite lapses hk gov. Sure merits universal testing merits presented discussed general population. discussion pros cons whether better use money needed. like Everything else imposed people. makes even bitter election taken away flimsy excuse however. Carrie Lam admits didn’t bother consult medical expert panel making decision.  people like caused Dad die recently coronavirus... air marshall take flight caught it. Dad 55 gone. Wear mask please try stay home tell loved ones love them.. Trust me.

PM details? work N.E. WI hospital nowhere near putting beds hallways. Definite boost covid, point yet. doubt last. want strong economy election leans Trump use idea wartime president “invisible enemy”.

What happens Election Day doesn’t matter.

They’re pretty much going kill people push Florida red Masks social distancing obligatory safe number people vaccinated. could take months vaccine introduced humbly suggest let’s patient endure.  Home newly wed nearly dead. r/CoronavirusIndiana, numbers pulled [here. 921 cases 8698 tested

Saturday: 1155 cases 9643 tested

Friday: 1195 cases 10198 tested

Thursday: 920 cases 9021 tested.

Watching numbers often, confirmed cases pretty level 9-10% weeks now. Recently, confirmed numbers bumping 10%. rest people want keep shit antivaxxers pay price. TBBH. millions

Uh, we're not. BIG leap one single million two million. likely going killed alcoholic event covid. should’ve added /s. Watch Death rate spike weeks. Nature toying impatient. Covid patient. Finally, little piece freedom Legacies donors admissions affirmative action white men. LOL, watched WW2 Color series Netflix. 56% men went bombing raids UK make back first year. assume Delta flight like trying fly Hamburg drop bomb tank factory? goddamn mask sight Troll? Lol wonder something number testing done. Afaik country (tropical) one countries lowest number testing done day. tropical countries also tend less developed healthcare system tests widespread northern hemisphere.

Just curious could one overlooked reason behind lower numbers. like letting car drift center lane every often bored rules. traffic low dumb unlikely burn you, traffic high almost certainly bound lose control. Well depends right? Elizabeth Warren fawned gone taught Harvard. agree politics odds dont give shit.  humanity bar muslims. Oh ya sucks. great plan, wondering there’s shorter timeframe normalcy worst case scenario fucked initially, definitely deserve called that. However since lockdown they've smart reopening, yes social distancing, mitigation policies.  would try argue points like see people educated, feel listen. Masks help prevent transmission respiratory illness, believe I'm wasting time. south Florida resident, fuck people. can’t wrap head around positivity rate important. seems don’t enough testing, enough random testing, truly indicative infection rates. Yes, would nice 0% positivity rate, take test likely symptomatic introduces severe bias number.

If high positivity rate testing enough. testing lots people find asymptomatic cases. don't, missing cases that's bad. favorite source fair balanced entertainment... Unfortunately, many people deficient compassion common sense. Enjoy ‘Rona. people lived worked there; I'm talking tourists weather finally cooled here, wearing mask outside lot comfortable. Good thing, walk work lot crowded used months ago. I’m almost numb point

I've quarantining since March. really leave house get groceries. live alone. But, look social media feeds see almost every single person know personally living best life pretending corona exist I'm point I'm numb well. I'm say fuck live normally. I'm lonely. posted non paywall version elsewhere comments Heck, I'd move PRoberts got Canadian couple years.  (Seattlite.) Stay home you’re scared. Pretty simple. spewed BS Finally agree! Thank think I’ll stay away Thank you, feel like lot people automatically discount anyone uncomfortable masks selfish dumbass massive change we’re used to. also miss seeing people’s faces it’s hard communicate effectively mask on. Also totally true oppression angle, it’s seen either oppressive suspicious I'm right now. crazy Florida... again... Nope, sure comment would infer that. clarify part post implies want people never stop wearing masks? happy make edit better clarify. catch simply talking to, shaking hands, hugging person? wish could screen people FL entering reasonable states.... increase testing cause rise cases positivity rate 25%. earth still considered valid counterpoint?

Cases going shitload cases. rate high 10x testing. think Walmart destroyed lot small towns lockdown. Yes that’s virus hoax. China said there’s virus quarantine wear masks, def opposite.

Galaxy brain. long he’s ends making CoVID regret video dies? whole college admission scam rich people paid child get prestigious schools, confirms lot people come Harvard, Stanford, Yale probably aren’t great. Especially come masters degree I'm sorry called retarded. He's homie extra chromie many people social lives value deeply don’t play video games use reddit elaborate?  see Johns Hopkins posting 10% positivity rate Indiana now. Yeah Joe Rohan’s saying since day 1. OK, dear. Whatever say. new deaths great! Grim reaper must twiddling thumbs🥰 Maybe live, everyone visiting friends family without even thinking mask. quote “ still first wave “ information turn monumental importance field vaccine drug development mutants becoming resistant vaccines monoclonal antibodies. 

Don't put evil me... you’re saying here, necessarily incorrect time misleading. Check study. had, most, incidence 0.04% among recoveries. common, number would low. People generate immune responses protect level infections least months, likely longer given understanding immunology. Point Roberts ridiculous. GIVE BC. problem is, they’re getting immunity running around infecting people.

I avoid bars restaurants, can’t avoid antimasker coworker go baby shower brunch Saturday 30 friends. wish working home possible job. Oof us thyroid problems, ya know

(Half joking 😝)  depressing part. save lives fine I’ll part get damn. youngest ever again.  Nyc dead, source- local also involves utter destruction education. thing drags deep next year, we're going see small brain drain effect older people retire, educational capacity shrinks pool replacements, many practical courses become nonviable due restrictions in-person learning.

We're going see total destruction live events, total slowdown television movie productions, huge knock-on effect performers, artists, actors etc. bars, pubs, live events (as slowly shut down), along restaurants hotels. Tourism industry complete decimates. mention perpetual productivity negatives caused people constantly self-isolate precaution.

Families also start realise never get see frail elderly family members either (if care homes).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s also saying efficacy vaccine unlikely 100%. 50% would acceptable. 70% would really good. reduces risk getting it, doesn’t eliminate it. Especially fat people. doctor nurse would move let people die. People sad man. toilet paper, buy bidet. Seriously, bought one Amazon I’ll never go back. yet still two Senators. 


Wyoming TINY. That’s total baloney. It’s gov wants bus supporters mainland vote them. crushed anyways. real concern overseas voters they’d allow mail ballots like everywhere else election. they’d worried people Vancouver, Sydney Toronto would vote them. want ways. typical live Etobicoke, Ontario. Basically part Toronto. frustrating. got email Today saying gym beggining ""new phase"" re-opening relaxing rules... wtffff. want able visit Mom Maritimes christmas ( Canadian Maritimes locked bc 0 cases ), people dont give AF covid anymore. ....well, Florida trashes itself. talk it.  efficacy vaccines yet know. Could low 50%. Also don’t know long immunity lasts. know lasts least 3 months. could vaccines redone frequently. Hopefully it’s early tell. “That’s terrible comparison” says guy compared deaths war deaths infectious disease. Lol wow Get sleep! Helps immune system immensely.

I’ve started rationing political covid news. Check bit day stay current, ignore 24 hours. Oh boy... can't wait vaccine. 

Only show serious anti vaxxers really are. Sure want deny people's children getting vaccines even though vaccinated already parents Autistic now. Now's chance really put money mouth is. 

Let's also see anti COVID Governors become hypocrites saying want vaccine Biden mandated it. sudden follow mandate!

The key different post vaccine stupidly truly affect since people protected. real Darwinism play. AstraZeneca first finish line, nobody get point, since two participants trials gotten sick.

So guess Moderna Pfizer lead point. Bill Gates comes play getting sleepy, needed know already becoming resistant antibodies Yup. Even cooler event. wow. 2 birds 1 stone Jeesh. Wtf. god damn hurry? Californian-born, get everybody world loves California wants live honestly ""number one best place world"" ask me. renting/housing cost, population, traffic, popularity really made lose interest home state considering moving back there. Nature, economy, entertainment great California still way overhyped overpopulated. talk Bay Area sports support talk California much. People talking California still annoy hell never ends. California worth it. End rant. also don’t know efficacy vaccines, could low 50%. Waves water. 
We still water however late spring ramp numbers faded now. inferance comming back. really scary. Hospitals supposed safe. US? didn’t start caring COVID response, won’t start now. Pretty much everyone pay attention anything ? GOP president symptoms festering sepsis circulating country. way, ""What talk about"" ""salad"". joke. That's best have. So, fucking asshole idiot doctors too.

As far tell, intermittent fasting actually impact obesity. way reset hormones regulate fat in/out. Salad fucking band aid. happens? compliance shutdowns everywhere? everyone follows directions cares.. blows.

I don’t think everyone follow closing they’re bizz dumb congregating carelessly. state well worries me.

I clue fo expect vagueness “winter months” killing me.  It’s kids! don’t know how, go roll day. That’s normal bathroom use.....it doesn’t include times uses dress mummy make soft toilet paper beds miniature pumpkin something. Loss income work, able see friends family. social isolation. people lives outside homes, responsibilities too. 

They get sit home play video games day. Never go full Reddit, man It’s probably better cases spike, base less likely let keep away voting booth likely immunity. average person, is. Keep believing fear mongering media. It’s painfully obvious much restrictions security theatre maintain dwindling support Tory government. Interesting economic super powers country i.e London Manchester seem require full lockdown measures. 

I’m Aberdeen Sturgeon thing it’s basically killed city. spike cases shut everything economy picking again, spike happens Glasgow she...stops people going other’s houses? keeps bars restaurants open?

I’m sturgeon supporter think overall she’s done well seriously stank me. look got lot important decisions make know much better exactly 1 half pints you.  


 I've legit slightly overweight doctors like, ""dude talk"" there's straight fat ass obese people. Yeah, something's off. Fat doctors too. Ever heard pointer sisters? Also, outdoors types would agree really lived local guide lead hike summit St. Roberts Peak. fortunate, guide experienced, might catch glimpse beautiful extremely rare Pointer Swallow, native area.

Point Roberts also notable home world's longest running barbershop chorus, which, far tell, organized time early 1800's. I'm generally one extreme patriotism, man, hearing song battle Robert's Point really got feels. even remarkable realize many singers great grandchildren brave souls fought long forgotten conflict Mexico. living fuck giving antibiotics someone viral infection? Culturally different? mean culturally diverse no, New Zealand higher immigrant population proportion, 1 4 New Zealanders foreign born. NZ homogenous White country, large Asian, Maori Pacific Islander populations. 

As size, Vietnam managed contain two waves efficiently developing country 90 million people limited testing ability. 

NZ also size average US state, falling Alabama South Carolina population. US response managed state level anyway. US states could easily replicated NZ system. Victoria shown possible completely suppress major outbreak closing land borders using military (national guard US) imposing strict 7-10 week lockdown curfews mandatory masking anywhere outside home. NZ basically thing March-May, Victoria shows works even cases numbers already huge land borders. Additionally, prove brain fog? Brain fog, described, exactly easily quantifiable test independently measured. Using tests measuring cognition problematic well, people cheat lower cognition, compare example 'cheating' blood test. can't make blood test show want without extreme bodyhacking, therefore blood tests relatively trustworthy measures.

For reasons conviction driving influence illegal substances commonly verified blood tests mumbo-jumbo measures cognition tests police officer site, tests highly subjective. test 1000 people week 1 500 positives 
And 4000 people week 2 1000 positives 

What’s result ? number double half ? tests unreliable, household transmission rate also lower commonly assumed, 20% people seperated upon symptoms onset, maybe 75% people take precautions whatsoever (the 75% figure uncertain study small say sure), since took partial precautions quite possible normal luck get infected. Table 3 household secondary infection study data: home visits.
No bars restaurants.
No jumping trampolines. district incorporating things last spring month try catch many kids possible. Luckily mine ok thriving.
I know it’s everyone’s reality it’s sad. Ironically, alongside opposite. live town several large universities. Every single PhD know looked see score enough points Canada's immigration system move there. don’t blame employees.. wouldn’t want get assaulted either calmly asking patron properly wear mask..  Florida nearly double average daily cases per capita compared Victoria, Australia, 10 week super hard lockdown time we've got almost nothing. Wtf Florida  already stuff park July. since gone down. Yo, whoa. Longcovid joke dude. Source? also show vast majority inflammatory markers go away? well, covid deniers also climate deniers, might see drop numbers shortly... Japan has, know why, high diabetes. low corona deaths. Now, diabetes/corona correlation might obesity component. Or, maybe Japan lies corona deaths (far possible think).

But, complicated.

Let's see winter brings. take 2-3 weeks get hospitalized another month machines dying. deaths start really roll around elect week imo. exactly refuse wear pants anytime I'm Indiana. Chindo! visited mall yesterday first time 3 months. saw 2 families masks on. people properly wearing masks penguins &lt;5% thought city city.

We (or county/state/whatever psap area is), that's I'm curious they're talking about. election proving anything can't learn anymore. like we're 2016 again. priveleged

Check privilege.

 They're fucking imbeciles fact behavior going get bunch innocent people killed I'd say ggod riddance. are. several stories healthy individuals 20's getting virus causing severe issues. mention even sure bad effects were. 1-2% effects everyone. could get covid survive, maybe next 5 years supposed fill workforce shows irrepressible lung damage. reports even say patients brain fog even office jobs become hard keep. happen enough people economy would collapse, society would likely find hard maintain itself.
That say, remains covid-19. Like said staring giant door always there, someone actually got through. next virus kind? increase transfer animal viruses, could get one spreads like covid leathel like ebola.
The limits crossed. reject it, make go away, still part problem.  family pushed back poverty, savings wiped out, kids lose years progress...

But okay, *I* light cough years, that's matters. accept fact lifestyle permanently changed, move on?

The OP raised worried able get job support economy tanks, response move fact likely end work unable support themselves? believe system ""makes examples"" people. precedent??

He precedent now. precedents examples made. reap sow, ""No underlying health issues?"" Okay, fatty. Maybe jerk next time. And/or, lay brewskies work out. thought city city. don’t see point national 911 call would like hope it’s near answer?
Maybe meant like association? Interesting. Unless course one gets super sick dies. non zero number low risk people die. Could you. Yeah saw lot doomsaying reddit many millions we’d counting now. Lot scared panicked people last spring.

In fairness, number see today would much worse unprecedented massive global response safety measures. No, no, no. ""Herd Mentality."" ""even vaccine, mean get sick"" -- case, means literally end rest lives. point, calculated risks absolutely table. risking 1-5% vaccinated public getting sick social gatherings indoors etc. back year half quarantine acceptable imo. numbers would much less flu, example, previously lived without batting eye despite deaths multiple tens thousands every year. live South Florida know already opened, zero zero surprise already packed, Lol definitely it.

People wildly disproportionate estimates actual threat face, especially children **literally** likely die flu. 

The driving reason hysteria Donald Trump opinion.

Two weeks incubation period 2+ cycles show infection rate.  disruption education awful long-term consequences.

My cousin taking Trig online right now. joke. test online without proctor. able Google MathWay get answers. learning anything. going prepare Calculus.

...well, yes. Covid leaving country major communicable spread in. family missed 20th anniversary, one kid's 18th birthday, other's 21st, graduation, campus tours orientation, wedding. I'm still fine staying home wearing mask next summer. Get learn compassion. called living civilized society.

..looks like shit ton people relaxing home symptom free two weeks. nightmare going end... Yeah, flu season starts. normal time year people get sick, say every sickness Covid people get sick time get sick every fall. Serious “experts”. knew October 2019 via Event 201. Let guess, cases drop US gets involved another war, household debt rises another 50%. covid affects oxygen supply. highly likely effect brain function. Let natural selection process work way should. Responsible companies require masks enter store, responsible employers flexible employees work home. Corona Virus happy that! I'm sorry Obama fix? know good intentions republicans fuck stop everything we're still Iraq. means actual number would possibly much higher tested more. mentioned Hobart populous city Tasmania, knew furthest equator. doubt snows sparsely populated mountains Tasmania. MEANT specifically snow HOBART. order compare Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York Boston, usually snow winter, none particularly impressive elevations sea level.

My point AUSTRALIAN CITIES milder winters US cities 500,000 people, there's likely time spent people INDOORS WINTER US Australia, indoors higher risk infection outdoors. IOW, inapt try extrapolate Australia's winter northern hemisphere's upcoming winter. MFGA! Cool. Got source? there's federal mandate effect insurance liability. quickly close businesses choose follow it. many born, like 200k? Nahhh work st pete Fl dead tonight lol Miami hot spot forever covid. ""just wearing mask"" sacrifice.

What sacrifice giving vibrant social life best years life meaning:

1) meeting/socializing new people

2) large group gatherings: sports games, concerts

3) travel

In terms career non-essential jobs jobs largely crewed young adults (restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, large venues, etc...). happy lots older people established enough work form home, generally younger generation got completely screwed.

In addition terms school online class 1.5 years going put college kids disadvantage job market well set back millions younger kids.

As 400 people 24 died Covid 190,000 people 24 years old almost one third population.

As snide comment literally what’s best objectively, sense indignity subject forces greater means tragedy you’re complaining circumstances forced think people.

So yes young generation sacrificed far others generation, gained least continue another year fuck comment. won’t wear mask get flu cold need go store 5 minutes? That’s shame. something years barely impact something basic. Japan ton unwanted pets, they're breeding place, I'm kidding. California well. I've depression way COVID. lockdown enjoyable (it's actually second one SARS student), entirely bearable always clear end game (at least country), especially tangible reduction numbers time.

That said, honest reality depression get worse. really much lockdown though, seeing people react self-centeredness exhausting. want things open soon possible, please wear mask medical excuse practice social distancing whenever can.

That said, feel worst essential healthcare workers. They've literally shouldering bulk burden associated pandemic. imagine working hard seeing people care all? Pandemic problem.


Masks, social distancing, hand washing, disenfecting things, sanitizing hands solution.


People refusing follow solution, extending problem.


See Finland, Norway, South Korea, Denmark, Japan, etc....

Yeah, run everything doctor. Keep safe there! Winter coming.  many lives saved? Pay them. People like media dying. would love George Romero circa 1968 Night Living Dead take society's response this. Agreed angry part! lot could decreased significantly proper national response. understand TB 


This pretty good link basic overview TB Returning back this, 10 weeks later. 

Seems like technically right.   Dont mean burst bubble EARLIEST vaccine may approved end year take months get hands everyone. shortage like shortage test kits. plan wearing mask post covid I'm using public transportation, main source get around town. Frankly wearing one along, point pandemic got again. devastating mental health. Esp able person meetings / therapy sessions. I'll take 0.01% chance way majority US population rolls dice health obese example Well said. issue India. Reports herd immunity reached close caused people longer cautious. Many places spoken herd immunity close virus resurge soon after. Sweden building again.... new York. Many states cities also tax companies value goods warehoused. Warehousing fewer goods means less taxes  Definitely safer skydiving half parachute.

Open already! Winter coming long. takes larger droplets covid transmit, ones still hanging air hours later able infect you.  Multiply number 100, percentage. Flu IFR also stratified age, see rough estimate, (note paper account portion asymptomatic flu patients, likely over-estimate)
but due existing immunity vaccination, pool people likely die small. Covid still require restrictions spirals control, even small IFR still large number deaths multiplied susceptible population. curiosity, located massive lockdowns still effect? thought almost every country post lockdown measures now. Rona ready. Bring it. Who’s gonna take over-under many days til Florida’s hospitals overrun? fucking brainwashed idiot. Glad I’m you.

Rolling lockdowns permanent disruption lives. you’re okay shut-in entire life doesn’t mean sane people are. Human history filled pandemics diseases time never caused permanent lockdowns. locked didn’t know anything virus don’t vaccine yet help put control. 

If turns covid going part life, need move forward. It’s Spanish flu. It’s Black Death. don’t essentially kill economy every 6 months tear people away virus doesn’t kills almost nobody isn’t elderly. there’s politician would ever that, get right fuck office.

Also, numerous countries already gone back normal restrictions. You’re already wrong ridiculous predictions. Imagine telephone game played 2000 years. Florida, even idiot governor Ron, Florida man 6 months still Q1. Good you. 25% you. rest support movement want hk protects human rights works people. Especially sucks US due fuck healthcare welfare system. ""Show one bit data proves elephant falling skyscraper would damage street magician. One bit data! one!""

But Florida Man totally thing. man Darwin follow I'm sure Masks proven surprisingly effective ray hope honestly. least protect dumbs.  running people point? rest US gonna see massive spikes idiots going Florida winter vacation. Unless 40 years away people responsible preparing really remember one. doubt they'll also think technology advanced enough nothing fear, discover something simple wearing mask public hotly controversial, vaccines probably mark beast. Yea ostrich skin purses ostrich feathers popular Afaik, FDA said Pfizer vaccine must 70% effective due low amount people actually got virus. Florida wants Disney money baby! SMH dosage? I’m sure keep putting words mouth. point nothing stated last two comments. Don’t get much dumber Flori-duh. They've fixed reopening bars - bump numbers. Real HKer here.

Mine offering house calls additional fee right now. honestly amazing. nurse practitioner house calls Dr office go way Lol ok keep wearing mask vaccine widely available, happens, dont get vaccine beliefs, dont trust it, idiot, dont deserve protection virus vaccine. quite sure honest first year it’s Southwest “winter” like high 60s flu season isn’t really impactful. bunch students getting pneumonia flu seen campus bug time. Obviously covid testing time one knew. friend, need shut two weeks. remember, two weeks went store today guy Trump hat mask said ""Fake News"" around neck. tempted tell mask much good around neck. figured probably best idea antagonize idiot store. Hmm government indoctrination centers produce working class tax slaves build empire coined education? Huh.

South Florida Hospitals packed Gov. gives OK reopening. - Future headline 2 weeks now. went dinner family member Wisconsin

Just point contrast, I'm Washington state eaten restaurant (indoor outdoor seating) since early January. say that's true everyone here, far person area say that.

If going dinner *anywhere,* 100% mercy everyone else thought fine go dinner. got flu right around time remember thinking it. Thankfully, flu fear one reasons started following religiously since then. costco before, needed saw area toilet paper paper towels completely empty. needed pinesol ran none left, guess new hot thing everyone taking. slowly going stock up, even though Canada big issues go stay home again, want ready. mean thats $33 US dollars about, ton more, $17. hardly insane It’S TrUmPs FauLt wasnt aware millions overseas Hong Kongers eligible vote.

You source that? Yooooo I’m arguing America handled it. It’s shit. 
But saying. Google says Miami Dade county population density Melbourne 100+. That’s even close “ “ 
And factor plain stupidity florida, it’s dangerous combination.

So Melbourne 3.8k sq miles 

Miami dade broward together 3.7k sq miles 
Population 4.7 little you’re saying Melbourne is..... travel INSANE AMOUNT Australia come across ne two million another city yours. 

In florida. 55x smaller means right next door broward Miami-dade. I’m talking WITHIN 15 miles. another million. Two count surrounding counties .
Melbourne size two Florida counties. put Melbourne edge edge another Melbourne like six times south Florida.

And talk florida. KEEP MIND. population include TOURISTS. 131million last year. one gets squalane sharks anymore. Today it’s olives, sugar cane beetroot. everyone military happy serving fascist. I’m sorry people wearing ostrich prior pandemic? Yes believe quest diagnostics $80. dont need doctors order. Insurance often billed way cash price. go back 15k cases daily surprise. People still convinced ok go bars w masks get worse cold. Also helps hordes free-dumb lovers. Trudeau don’t want dumbass lol Wholesome content Covid: ""First Wave.....AwWwW, hit wall....Woo-hoo! 2nd Wind!.....AwWwW naWwWwW another waaaaalllll!...Woo-hoo, Third Wind!"" could provide citations. 
If want people believe without proof go Facebook.  People literally completely missing points I’m saying. people vaccinated (especially high risk older) think returning normal life necessary inevitable next 6 months substantially deaths first 6. 6 months ago spreading point cases, next 6 months starting point millions cases. best 10% percent might already infected plenty wood fire. Cold weather also make burn faster people indoors more. Double? 400000 more?
And official deaths. Mortality running least 30% higher.
But deaths. enough said co-morbidities.... concerning mortality. Since value life money, would good thing China donate new medical supplies Syria, it? states, counties definitely, neighbors miles apart you, like midwest, Virus isnt going spread. didn’t close borders healthcare workers went strike. 3rd wave caused exemptions quarantine hk gov exempted people favor tycoon buddies. used excuse cancel elections. farce gov is!!  think quarantine simple? open border millions people bring significant risks city government bear take blame convenience. quarantine practices they're recieved tremendous criticism inefficient, expensive problematic. Jesus, I'm South Australia 0 active cases we're even allowed stand pub/bar blows mind. days off??? :( 

I furloughed since essential worker. even so, field either laid furloughed. Personally think employer handled lot things poorly continue affect daily work life. However, think fellow employees got furloughed, always felt grateful steady work. 

I understand resentment, especially people quarantined (or least SUPPOSED quarantined) making money sitting home. ways never seemed right me. 

For never felt resentment two reasons: would drop pay I’m sure would entitled anyhow since I’m American citizen. live here, work (legally) pay taxes, that’s it. concur Yea there’s tweet there, paraphrasing, saying charge shit goes bad it’s fault! He’s spent 4 years making excuses it’s fault...so cult!

200k dead watch, control spending deficit economy shit. Doesn’t matter he’s charge, it’s fault. don’t need another 4 years, need change need NOW!

VOTE! Fuck guy. never said don’t wear mask feel empathy anyone. wear mask time. However vaccines released enough people them, think going back normal life necessary inevitable.

Zero reason hostile firey I'll roll dice. I'm wrong r/ justiceserved jerk im dead trying live life  Hmm go work risk infected, starve get evicted, that’s nice choice I’ve got there. I’m glad you’re privileged enough consider actual choice, many people wasn’t option. it’s people like you, aren’t taking seriously, put us situation. Losing heart functionality probably worse, 70% covid positive individuals showing heart scans, including asymptomatics. Forgetting bad things people go bars 2018 China, 

International tourism made 127 billion
Whereas domestic tourism made 875 billion

In usd.

Source helps, wearing mask still contracting virus still better mask all. Early research suggests there’s less virus system, better body fend off. Presupposes people would go shop buy travel bodies piling up. Assumes people cut back spending hoard people dying.

Yup. lockdown. Guess go anyplace essential? fish! Anything possible since Covid coronavirus coronavirus infections rise winter, would put money weakening one needs afraid shadows.  know fight virus protect others. actually fucking it. 70% covid positive people heart issues, including asymptomatic cases. Aww, thanks bud! complete absolute fuck regarding even slightest measures slow spread. kind thing later act do, even weeks making massive difference What's really hurting country tendency reduce everything simplicity becomes meaningless plant hypocrisy flag. one party hyper-partisan going cause partisanship opponents automatically make hypocritical partisan point one fault. 

That's conditioning people think criticism one party necessarily endorsement other. course lock downs everything reopened reopening time elections says IFR 0.7 % much, much higher flu world talking about? CDC says flu’s mortality 0.1 %, it’s [probably much lower even 0.1 % figure comes model doesn’t match actual reported deaths (CDC claims ~60,000 die year hospitals typically report 3,000-15,000 deaths). 100% false.  200k fucking dead come.  actual fuck wrong people? fucking pandemic political issue.  Republicans Democrats dying honest god people need shut hell sides nonsense.  Democrats trying address pandemic nearly year point Republicans done NOTHING stand way. surprising leader denialist. Nurses best. appreciate mom! can’t take anymore. due diligence keep getting sick much. idiots taking seriously, politicians nothing stop shit. It’s pissing I’m scared. can’t leave country one wants Americans. can’t leave state jobs require us stay. job bare minimum avoid liability people stupid questionnaire daily asking us symptoms fever travelled, mask mandates sales floor. 

I hate this. hate public. hate president, hate governor state. Agree. Everything taken account everything mean absolutely everything: economic impact lockdowns, social development issues students skip in-personal teaching, missed cancer screenings, increase poverty, mental health, etc...

It's answer want hear but....some countries world need second lockdown ASAP countries world locked first place.

There's one-size-fits-all pandemic response, one measured every countries' health facilities + ability provide livable wages unemployed lockdowns. works Taiwan work Peru vice-versa.

Sweden right creating sustainable pandemic response. Today, Swedes ones experience least pandemic fatigue entire world since social distancing requirements reasonable sustainable long term. 

The can't said 99% developed world started party like crazy first lockdown lifted. 
P-aslls Toilet paper usage minimal here. bidet warm water, heated seat, dryer takes care everything. Mine comes built-in night light too! I'm sorry get answer. :( won’t happen US. record hospitalization numbers. WI, ND, SD, NE,MO highest number hospitalized patients since pandemic began. IA hit soon. Everybody world loves California wants live there?? left alive? Roughly people said - pass law make Lawsuits possible. Problem. Solved. Guess we'll see many results in. :/ help veterans South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa Republican governors. point? Fair point, worth considering humanity's treatment animals created pandemic ones past I’m aware addition us worry efficacy safety politically motivated rushing said vaccine. ghoulish thing say thread people obviously concerned issue. 

You ashamed Sorry, get vaccine I’m going social distance anymore. I, can’t infect anybody? That’s nuts. pathetic loser Current hospitalization numbers Wisconsin real story. setting records. specifically wrong them? (just curious. doubting judging.) get I’ll never get experience back. first generation college student, experience something always looked forward well education part things. lost year half opportunities memories. lot harder catch Show death rate, maybe I'll care went Papa john’s Oakland Ave day. sign said “no mask service” two guys worked masks chins! pissed guess really mean someone say 'out world' estimating Wisconsin's current R 1.12, range 0.9-1.35(!!). 

R also typically lags week two, so... Kudos old man front lines craziness. mom, crazy health issues well, basically hazmat suit everyday hospital nurse. know goes.

Listen man, don’t agree this. hope time next year we’re house, vaccinated, loving life again. shit blows I’m done are, guarantee it, I’m approaching differently all. need bodies body... knows maybe mutations, deaths ventilation (it's recirculating air). Business cannot operate without insurance.

Lawsuit + dead body + indoor air + insurance = bankrupt business None y’all never went get drinks get invited parties shows. want people share misery. News flash.... lockdowns last resort. US never locked down. I’m sure nice people. rather stay town. Canada actually getting second wave, officially. done wave 1, cases month since reopened everything. Well, obviously people getting infected. Florida one worst states handling COVID Im one “good” states. positivity rate low high adherence terms mask wearing. 

We still cases every day Canada 1/10th population. 

And 3% people tested positive died. 3 100. good state. good healthcare. Following rules part. 

People clue bad going get low adherence areas bad healthcare options winter. Confirmation Madison church many people church! scared might get covid. I’ve places except Beulah lived Pace time. born Pensacola btw. meaning check out, do! Really loved FP, could watch Defoe talk birds hour haha black, I’m guessing wouldn’t mentioning race. want make whites look like idiots something. answer question. WI, SD, ND, NE, MO highest levels hospitalized patients since pandemic began, daily increase hospitalizations incredibly steep. IA record, increasing again. No, [that’s actually thing. sister took life long haul symptoms. shit joke. happens people know go jail wearing mask possibility virus weaker lower temperatures ? Downtown / neighborhoods directly surrounding good now. try leave Pace, Milton, cantonment, beulah completely different animals. No, recommend them. face certain situations impossible keep distance 1 metre others, face masks recommended additional measure prevent infection people COVID-19 without symptoms increasing spread infection. live south Florida many people ""fuck it"" mindset, including myself. Sorry, sorry. elderly, susceptible negative effects covid, regularly contact someone is, yeah, stay safe. many us trying make living also living life worth living. serious quarantine beginning, obviously happen. virus already stay vaccine mass produced. death rate low; black plaque we're talking about. Heart disease/obesity, car accidents much likely kill ones love. spend time focusing battling fast food chains helping autonomous vehicle companies? like focus what's easy hate. There's honestly billion things kill universe. Fuck it. Keep moving forward. Feel free downvote. Whatever gets day. half people (usa) wont learn unless catch themselves. that's exaggeration, really half. family member catches die they'll likely never believe sickness could dangerous rest life College classes. experiences research, internships, service opportunities, etc. Online cannot replace working professors lab. 

And broad based learning absolutely essential. people stay position entire lives. promote management, move sales, become consultant, completely change fields, knowing learn new things, research things, disseminate information come valuable. want flexible, need basis build from. Man, like they're TRYING lose election. infant hasn’t seen doctor six months. giant running list next appointment questions ask. Thankfully don’t major concerns seems developing appropriately. boat. hate getting shots, honest, I’ve never gotten hit flu before. flu shot skippable year year going forward me. Makes glad there’s least kind vaccine respiratory illness, guess.  Let run course like New York. That’s way crush curve. evidence level mutation happening particularly strong. sure whether vaccine need yearly not.

So far, looks like virus mutates fairly slowly, noteworthy mutations far ones would necessarily required new vaccine we'd already one. jury still future. happened.

They assured cases would follow bell curve. said places like China lockdown, US also lockdown, surely trajectory. moved curves around match, voila, COVID eradicated US August.

It abundantly clear everyone rules US nowhere near tight China, rigorously enforced either. say least.

IHME's assumptions complete trash, known time, published ridiculous methodology. can't give benefit doubt, doubt. sucked, simple that. Even herd shows seeking asylum? Could be. Could also bad. think anyone good guess it.

I would err side worse, treat forgone conclusion. So. Cases deaths. testing positive that's needed HCQ, Azithromycin ZPack.  sister Utah tested positive days ago. Fortunately, symptoms seem light. yes, agree you. lot people think exaggerated. Bruh live Navarre got Presidential stuff bit worse Pensacola. Pensacola good now.  too. longer feel need bash head wall, plus I'm get lot reading done. kind behavior exactly govt needs enforce safety laws 🤣 bodies pile up, Covid-19 deadly.

Also - every country libel happy USA, point moot, furthermore US government pass law stop people suing businesses get sick premise. Problem. Solved. came pretty close 2003, SARS around 10% IFR reason SARS eventually contained infectious incubation period incubation period days shorter COVID average, making contact tracing possible. contagious incubation period like vast majority viruses long COVIDs incubation peroid would world wide catastrophe possibly even infectous SARS virus 25% Smaller COVID. Trump culling Dumbfuckistan. Collective society many elected leaders. know solution causing people afraid neighbor's shadow it. I’m person responded to, family distant family member snowbirds Florida. decided stay summer year angry Governor shutting March/April adding mask mandate couple months later. super happy Florida, could go beach Florida, go restaurants, go whatever wanted. even decided go Disney, show support. One dead now. didn’t go easily. died ICU vent, drowning fluids, wife forced quarantine, asymptomatic. know one relatives. family telling people died natural causes. aren’t acknowledging died COVID-19. saw pictures sister party masks on. denial people run deep. sickening living (in WI). Local restaurants, spas, etc. literally post Facebook require masks ""know may medical condition want disclose"". One restaurant posted today asking customers thought waitstaff bartenders ""forced"" wear masks. 99% responses ""no"". Police inforce mask mandate. blame them.

Meanwhile, husband hardly left house since early March. pulled toddler daycare nearly 7 months ago already caution. 

Thank goodness Midwestern accent nearly pass Canadian. I'm pretty ok frigid temperatures. Canada seems like reasonable option people start using brains! attend top private university 75% grants scholarships, say totally accurate. first generation student, much happy arrived campus, soon realized grew much different world classmates. jump one hurdle another. I’m able pull poor class citizen, catch l, cases impossible. classmates, really establish family. support besides virtue signaling? people post it’s freedom, you’re freedumb. March large scale PCR testing, people knew sick not. scale outbreak far larger case counts time. low positivity rates states, meaning people generally know sick isolate themselves. controls spread significantly. masks awareness make difference. things chip away R value. less viral transmission community economic social activity.

In March basically ignored problem long choice lockdown (though pretty loose unenforced lockdown).

Also, regional lockdowns part pandemic playbook decades. example used places 2003 contain SARS outbreak (a related coronavirus). Even Toronto lockdown control spread SARS. already nearly 10% cases United States. people stay home then. We're shutting society couple bubble boys. Hanson voting “Trump way”, feels America grown far divided. “Do want carry baseball bat everywhere go? No, sometimes feel like to.”

I think really interesting, non-white, second-gen immigrant, sometimes feel like might want carry sort defense me, really humanizing/interesting/confusing person, internalize ""one bad guys"", feels way guy tell public takes vitamin D3 50% higher recommended medical maximum yet say squat public. freaking stone hypocrite. Half country would rather pretend everything normal die result take sort inconvenience matter many lives saved. think key relative containment begin with. Proper measures taken small outbreak = high odds success regardless season. would give away rights freedumbz wearing mask 5 minutes??? Hmm????


/s called loser sucker make plants tons skincare brands do, seems like theoretical 'could happen' article inflame people plant squalene medicine cabinet actually though. referring 33% drop Q2 GDP know figure annualized. words GDP drop US actually closer 9% quarter. 

Most European countries saw bigger decline that. Germany example saw 10% drop. 

Edit: sure downvoted, true. US GDP reporting annualized, European countries dont domestic product — broadest measure economic activity — shrank **annual rate 32.9%** second us thing called ""empathy"", perhaps heard it. 
So, **fuck off**: gay Black handicapped see folks demographics treated. served military know hard mostly thankless underpaid job tough hell people normal times. Ugh world, hast thou forsaken us? well seems relevant like effect ton people. Sure buddy. That’s canceled elections. thought you’d win? lol. Good one I'm always afraid spit on. Canada arguing weeks whether resturants/bars private gatherings that's causing recent rise cases. guess find month watching Florida. Good luck. virus extremely seasonal.

That's surge. That's blip. Absolutely WILD decision making leadership. 

When saw posts DeSantis reopening Florida was...astonished? Astonished quite capture befuddlement. 

On one hand, SUPER hopeful outdoor maybe breeze ocean help disperse aerosolized/droplet particles help keep cases down. hand, I've seen posts people rolling enclosed, non-ventilated spaces, I'm bullish it. 

Any current beach Floridians all-gas-no-brakes-style first hand knowledge? RIP Florida. NBA bubble survive New York’s second wave inbound. Going shit last time. isn’t hard see coming, it’s already starting. Humanity trash. Florida's fucked. Sadly, \^\^\^ said. gonna spend credits upgrade winter. USA deaths 10k covid only.... deaths covid diabetes heart disease obesity.... per CDC. Italy reporting deaths? stay home? southern state ongoing stay-at-home order? Working home unemployed forced stay home. Go work Walmart McDonalds like it, people sure get choice stay home. I'm sure seen gone procure food TP, outside home.  murica never ceases amaze me.  can't help ""commander""-in-chief badmouthing dedication sacrifice, besides transparently incompetent corrupt. 


No sane military person would support joke Oval Office. work morning lady walked stood probably less foot face mine. stepped back. helped get transportation set told ""I'm glad corona over"". afterwards, grabbed arm turned could touch read nametag. I'm sure I've felt violated long while. Good luck getting people vaccinated.  time election. that, cares guess. Loss smell taste dangerous. rely taste smell know food gone bad. would greater risk food poisoning. 

Sense smell also used detect gas leaks fumes. 

Brain fog would impact earning potential loss taste smell could affect health safety.  3 weeks prepare watch Florida cases skyrocket again.

RemindMe! 3 weeks Wow! sitting talking feel good? Funeral homes must making killing USA. endemic. Everyone get covid point next 50 years hopefully survive become stronger it. can’t wait til we’ve 7 billion cases fucking let middle lower class people get back work pay debt they’ve accrued work 7 months. Always love seeing state Coronavorus front page. feel safe secure surroundings. society needs learn deal internet, politicized media, propaganda better, else kind democratic civilized society gonna fail. Good stuff. Surprised stocking condoms make list. understanding everyone inside store expected wear mask, wearing said mask, chance getting covid inside store possible lowest, correct? Starbucks today thoroughly surprised see every single customer wearing mask course staff. probably best surprise seen southern town long while, even thought covid hoax wearing mask (albeit covering noses still!). experience today remembering studies asking true. healthcare system get overwhelmed? That’s exactly is. replace undesirable drains people unlimited capital desire build. Getting rid eyesore high rises beach eye sore inhabitants. much sympathy disantis people. wanted Trump badly voted schools anything benefited community besides things themselves. So. Oh wellll. They're election Damn democrat run states /s Halloween Translation: ""Even cure shit, still can't allow business reopen Democratic governors revoke excessive totalitarian powers."" mean ones getting laid lack work? cleverly worded article ""highest *positive* testing rates""

As in, they're trying shame states, higher covid numbers general vs states, rather, testing probable person tested covid. weird thing shame entire region country for. Even weirder people gobbling without hesitation comments section here. Wow, that’s awful. Also Illinois visiting Wisconsin. actually impressed amount mask-wearing saw precautions taken. didn’t really see employees wearing masks tbh. Probably different different parts state. nabes concerts ever again? like assumptions overly optimistic naive believe people would/could actually right thing. graph could looked different depending gvmt people's responses Looks like spike split NYC upstate noting certain ZIP codes Brooklyn lower Hudson Valley....

Hey walk, alright? Walmart parking lot pretty big. **Noble Peace Prize know believe talking about, nice edge feel pal. really like different species. video featured pretty significant number people appear one high risk groups So, no? Covid spreading based seasonality debunked since beginning. would winter make things worse? Ok princess.  lived whole life never heard this. Asked someone else, neither they. bad hope doesn’t become thing. Moving Midwest soon, worries honest. going follow super strict precautions travel, going super cautious arrive. 

I bit angry. angry get sick. honestly stressing feel robust plan full PPE avoidance plans, still worried could exposed others serious virus. 

I forgive anyone get sick, seriously. feel shit terrible everyone exposed work public, feel angry people reckless could expose workers. Covid magical, follow fucking rules protect peers. Careful mental health - beware benzo treatments specifically. ruin life. FDA gave warning finally last week 60 years sheer ignorance. can, should, I'm sure hermits sub probably still crying someone outside somewhere. 2.9% fatality rate US, like 97.1% (so far!) seems higher rate excess deaths US there’s undereporting sure.

Now that’s copious amounts social isolation. Without that, look Mexico already 10.9% fatality rate.

This Florida super fucked.

To give perspective, 10.9% US would 35.77 million dead everyone caught there. Florida proving Darwin wrong decades.

It's like Idiocracy natural selection. Australia here, Year 12's (final year highschool) ends October/November most. There's nationally standardized exam subject that's sat across board, exceptions. results school based examinations conjunction nationally sat exam forms aggregate score well performed year.

My state locked school year, schools states seen similar lockdown measures due non existent case numbers. Say person, face-to-face teaching vs online think disparity year's Year 12's state vs rest country unless special considerations applied. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana democratic governors.... Yeah wording used recently odd say least. Last week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made National broadcast pretty much opened ""The second wave isn’t starting, it’s already underway"". Underway? Like part plan something? Odd. gross negligence call genocide Lmfao imagine believing shit!

We could lop fuckers like cancerous tumors fucking fine!!! someone willing take risk take rushed vaccine still needs wear mask social distance, take risk? skip rushed vaccine wait little bit longer? Well, obviously me, live busy building dense city, building management strict mask usage building. hard, just, know, slip mask fine. many alcoholics NEED go bar ...because they've gaslit believing Biggest state pop, IL, 3.2% positivity rate. It’s hovering recently that’s good news! mean reference masks thing. simultaneously combing masks kids need go school. I'm fine going school, precautions need made. us.

Mask up, spread out, explain terms understand children. 

They also used context ""6% covid-19 deaths Covid-19 means healthy 6% chance dying covid-19"", cdc information.

I blatantly told 100% misinterpreting information. correct.

Are medical field?

I ER PA. live breathe pandemic. one hardest hit states. never unmanageable significant period time. it’s embarrassing saddening we’ve done society economy... Missouri people wear masks chin guards, nose, mask all. there’s people actually wear mask correctly, everyone does. number seems accurate. feel like it’s kinda way everywhere though Someday pass earth true Scary times, remember ridiculous air raid drills kids taught duck desks case nuclear attack reason, think we'd go back least WW2 really match kind societal collapse we're witnessing... yet that's bad example strong leadership brought us together then.

Everyone know edge... nothing lockdowns. don’t rely tourism. Darwinism work Moo. Well, fair start 10th grade got transfered finals, guess everyone missed year school kinda boat...only worse pandemic damage. Mind asking area Wisconsin? live Appleton probably 95% people wear masks shopping, Stevens Point moved college. Thanks. covid back February I'm OK Eh, wait til hear lot us want vaccine either. They're going flip. ""Where fun goes die"" keeps getting true. 99.9% survival rate, yeah, somehow everyone gonna die. Great read Thanks friend drove car I'm safe stupid quarterly GDP reporting US handled way. domestic product — broadest measure economic activity — shrank **annual rate 32.9%** second gross domestic product (GDP) increased **annual rate 2.0 percent** second quarter US.  NJ still ton restrictions place Governor lifting infection rate low enough.  

Fauci even said week current restrictions puts NJ good position handle fall season. TB kills 1.5 million year, including younger people years ahead them. Sadly, crazy response virus means number far higher future years, due lack vaccination. pandemic ruining economy, reaction pandemic ruining it? nephew naval academy getting checked myocarditis covid July. gets chest pains exercising. never hospital excellent shape. Supposedly fairly common happening young athletes covid. go away, permanent cause problems road.. one seems know. It’s coming. Let's get first wave, first. expecting too, due November. last 6 weeks stocking up. Nothing crazy, extra shop. 2 boxes wipes (we usually 1), 10 jars spaghetti sauce, 2 packs paper towel (we usually open one get roll two I'll grab another one) etc. I've also finished christmas shopping worry. Part want expose baby, part husband sucks groceries shopping general so... Lol.
I think smart thing, again, wild once. watched sales stocked things came up. Lol real ""sheep"" haters lining vaccine ""amazing"" leader steam rolls fast, virus that's supposed hoax. guys can't understand basic concepts logic. Despicable real sheep following leader who's lied endlessly hoax virus depending vaccine 🤔? certainly disappear narratives strongly shift. liberals ready reopen conservatives eager blame reopenings Biden everyone act like stance along. makes happy hear! pleased Starbucks get coffee fear antimaskers getting virus, everyone wearing mask attempting social distance. didnt even know exotic skins fashion- thought died exotic fur industry 80s. 

Huh...Interesting. parents live 4 hours base. went seeing usually twice month without leave three months. went big family trips birthdays birthday small apartment watching TV getting takeout. finally meet favorite lake last two weeks filling paperwork weekend- took 3 days 5 pushbacks figured want filled out. time parents state became green state still fill form filled section chief, flight chief, added leave request approved commander. 

I went call week every month, 24/7. sent people home really nothing, small team us working 16 hours least twice week. slept family members birthday working night. less demanding issues freedom deployed without visa. Fortunately leadership understanding took care us needed. like coworkers, issues leadership, family support probably would depressed. 

Even travel opening up, extra rules really bad timing tempo team ran ragged. usually handle stress well part day day, drinking desks (which used career killer) acceptable. told one guys major issue end day (very important him) plans later, thought going throw something punch wall. thought rough time, watched left work try care leave him. He's fine now, get people able help workload downtime day. seeing bad here, imagine alot places worse surprised one bit.

Just needed vent bit there's story last months. job concerns livelihood least. person worst probably family moved halfway across country, moved living crowded hotel young child. First time going school trying online school. said screw kind allowed to- go telework unless need come something. Trying work make sure one spouse work time. I’m sorry. That’s awful. collapsed since pandemic started ""bars opened."" bars open months. miss sitting chill bar, nice conversation bartender, trying different cocktails. know what? wait isn’t fucking deadly airborne virus going around!!!  Let’s stop testing report cases symptoms POGGERS sure defeats point ""live music."" Pretty sure one enjoy concert stadium wearing mask.


But also, EO/law. One wear mask appropriate/non-intrusive stage described above. Mine too. It’s heartbreaking, want safe don’t think taking seriously. least, responsible member family isn’t. Wisconsin stupidity another level. I’m dreading holidays. :/ thoughts prayers you. &lt;3 Except literally worst years life. average death covid believe past typical life expectancy. It’s absurd. don’t want anyone die even able discuss this, wrong. attest.

Started Pandemic drinking beer. 4-5 day turned 6-8 9-11, 12 per day June. 

The stress anxiety Pandemic takes over.

Had come doctor help otherwise would drank early grave. 

He told never many patients substance abuse problems deal life.

ShiiiiiiiiiT. People still listen Dr Fauci? guy shows camera wearing mask made fabric...that filters next nothing...as actually wears real life N95 comparable? Give break, he's part show. So? Oh god people going die lower rate flu? Looking numbers looks like big places ton worse, population, always plan trip checking case numbers places go through.


Avoid Milwaukee  That's 20 people dead. Japan pretty much normal lives since started February. total cases less weekly new US cases half population total everyone living country size California. wonder everyone social distancing wearing masks responsibly beginning...

(SPOILER: is!! O: )

So go ahead, go back normal keep infecting shaming compatriots best keep infections down! sure patriotic! please, completely ignore covid already killed half many Americans ww2 did. majority (doctor) coworkers insult others wearing mask, complain aren’t distanced work... freaking go state wedding, host houseparty,

How know aren’t following CDC guidelines events? Also wearing mask properly social distancing isn’t hosting rock concert 500 people pack small area Florida says ok happen. Fucking morons. Bars literally one worst places right now, people get sloppy alcohol. 

Live WA State, glad Florida across nation us. problem one side. one party people trying reasonable address issues matter, another party filled lunatics elected sex offender reality TV want get everyone killed pandemic. fighting division exhausting, necessary conservatives keep trying fucking stupid. need knock fuck off.

Just look something like Obamacare, modeled Romneycare, based part ideas arch-conservative Newt Gingrich proposed alternatives Clintons' health care plans 90s. centrist, free-market solution huge problem. conservatives made defeating one top priorities, care policy people, Democrats like therefore hate fight it.

They ideas. values. morals. defined purely unthinking resistance whatever progress Democrats want make. vast majority worship grifter bragged committing sexual assault national television. nothing wrong us despise flaws. way end petty partisan bullshit end party petty bullshit.  Yup - Dems hiding 200k supposedly dead people somewhere. Source? Trump: ""they killed losers, cowards served purpose liberals deserved die anyway."" choice. There's law says school start did. chose start anyway knowing access would equal. Interested well. consensus among experts positivity rates 5% indicate cases likely going undetected. Every undetected case new chain exponentially growing infections. PARTY TIME!!!! poor fine scholarships grants etc. it’s middle lower upper classes take brunt unfairness, pain exorbitant costs gonna say this! comment going be, worry, Florida catch up! 60 persons village 800 got COVID confirmation.

1 death aged 97 yo.

3 Hospitalized age 80-67-65.

All got sooner later fine. One lady 65 went without taste months. Old men 80 kept shedding virus tests months although completely healed symptoms anymore.

Over half asssimptomatics started associate light issues past COVID. Remaining symptomatic got sent home waited out. handled better others course.

In words, healthy, stop freaking out. underlying problems, keep distance.

The way really stop pandemic tracks get many healthy young people infected possible. overwhelming majority suffer serve contention barriers slowing spread.

No vaccination solve problem itself. need considerable resistance within population. Keeping population gaining immunity opposite bodies trained do.

In words, people sort precautions wrong. ones think permanent lockdown everyone behave like experience death,. fact asked means yes, should. now, calmly, everybody else. (with mail order, delivery, curbside pickup) literally caused deaths thousands people. He's mass murderer. Ugh, first time agreed FIB. drive nail coffin, many Americans currently making full-time essential workers making government unemployment handouts.

It's still important people get money need survive, I'm saying bash people need stay home choice. Yet essential workers really getting worst pandemic, neither government companies batted eye yet. Florida Black Zone... 232 people contact coronavirus carriers none infected? anyone explain possible mask wearing restrictions dining restaraunts relaxed? wasn’t fact need money move may would seriously consider quitting job, there’s many idiots come mask, well coworkers wearing masks. hate gamble organs money. Damn seem like overkill last bit? Could collateral consequences devastating.  simple shutting everything indefinitely like many people seen want.  There's easy answers this. feels America grown far divided! course... Jump virus poison... Florida, never disappoint avoiding critical thinking.  Florida opened bars again. They’ll soon giving y’all run money. argument valid given real harm society keeping kids home doing, benign fatality rate per CDC age group, lack great treatment, fact get disease. little faith rushed vaccines working let alone injuring people higher rate disease harms people, especially youth close friend mine military avid supporter Trump. talking supported money. Basically said loved changes military budgets / spending Trump. never told him, made lose lot respect him. time bring terrible things president done (like Lafayette photo op) says ""yeah, im making 15k thanks Trump"". blows mind person thought knew well willing drop morals something low 15k / year. Neat!  grandma lives there!  parents!  I'll flay fuckers kill them! sarcastic Trump called Noble Peace Prize tweeted ""Noble Peace Prize"" once, well. 

He dumbest mother fucker alive. gave Diarrhea. misleading kinds reasons.

Yes, places people pretending everything ok, people seemed cheerful.

That's great... consequences set in.

Then... much.

And measuring? MOMENTARY happiness someone like inconvenience... long term effects sticking heads sand? might, might youre definitely part problem right  state in? believe you. don’t understand getting downvoted asking honest question. 

From evidence data that’s taken thus far younger people don’t pre-existing conditions aren’t going ICU making full recoveries without lasting effects. However it’s still novel virus saying aren’t long last conditions little data back claims.

We still take every precaution possible contract virus. I’m worried getting virus dying I’m terrified catching passing onto another individual. I’m safe possible taking every precaution necessary protect around me. Yes. told mayors allowed make rules masks social distancing. People need use moment catalyst reform. whole educational system disrupted right now, mindlessly penalize students damn reason it’s going hurt whole generation. public aid kids parents might able afford internet bills computers tele-classes. 
School districts could massive public works program designed get free meals delivered homes.

It’s criminal universities trying charge full tuition sub par learning experience. It’s evident years cost higher education U.S. tied future economic growth. need free public education U.S. 

People need seize moment push change that’s sorely overdue. I'm already trying convince family get together outside immediate family groups get older family together. dad's (oldest child side family's support) 2 brothers serious (and immediate family) are. I'm México I'm trying organize zoom video call whole family Thanksgiving. Case point always interesting seeing citing NZ's handling COVID. Unfortunately, America many countries large culturally different small island nation New Zealand. think that, won’t argue feel. exactly sure you’re commenting attitude, think I’m pretty reasonable. You’re gonna want, that’s right. may agree see things, commenting feel situation. don’t think line thinking dangerous way though. I’m curious could expand mean? scared pointing election meddling black hands behind ""organic"" protests, you? That's trying change subject.

Can tell exactly many ""volunteer"" rioters stopped showing moment money stopped getting handed snakeheads, moment money pools dried HSBC froze suspicious accounts? crazy crossdressers, cheap brainwashed kids/elderly folks violent thugs living government welfare checks. Can't afford better quality rioters, mean. wear fake shit need traffic cone colored plastic looking mini skirt. need go way twat. Isn’t like excessive waste consumerism look bought gross point? interested like living tent made twigs yet it’s like don’t want see greed every second. much. invested insurance companies, good bottom line shares. really think losing job alone thoughts worst things happen person? People world overcome worse every day behaving like victims.

It's astounding little resilience people showing. life must incredibly easy year. lot thankful for.

When dealt way worse, truly bizarre see things people say can't handle. first crisis extent pretty privileged thing fed over. Someone like alone might (or might not) find another job one day. want hear throwing pity party incredibly fortunate position.

You handle fine. fair life fair. aftermath we're going instability global economy conflicts creates going much, much worse best learn resilience now. going back. 

So many people operating assumption safe ill effects world happened. sub ban people spouting complete lies virus? country 0, credible countries using scientific methods 0. Russia China 5, together lol. Human rights also awesome countries, dictatorship, no. Google maps? released yet. one layers options Google maps. Please let true Also plunging never poverty. ever get first wave? Astonishingly racist whole.

You must forgotten 8 years obama... convenient CDC chart uses ratio like quote says. 

So let's say 100 people infected 10 people died. CDC chart would reported 10/100 = 0.1

0.1 equal 10%. chart, age 50-69, IFR 0.005 saying IFR 0.5%. 

The common number flu 0.1% 0.001 want express percent terms. 

So flu covid19, elderly much higher risk die younger people. 

So unless age group age group comparison, way say flu's IFR less covid19's based info CDC chart. can't fun without permission government, fuck point living?

I want exist house, working basement binge drinking weekends. think that's life everyone condemned to, incredibly selfish. ""hardcore d**mer"" narrative myth. Every time ask one people point discussion containing hardcore doom expressed inappropriate way, fail so. wailing demographic shown exist.

This narrative spreading negative sentiment taking reasonable precautions national health crisis. kind people would spread kind propaganda? much viral load virus spread asymptomatic carriers seems depend age carrier strain virus well. 

The SARS-COV-2-virus - strain common Europe scientists theorized lower viral load strains America right now.

Viral load one way putting aggressive virus is. course due increase testing, seen anyone make argument response story...to appears obvious result *lack testing* well possibly increase positive cases. Sweden did

Let's look Sweden compared neighbors. Sweden over:

* 5 times number deaths per capita worst performing neighbor, Denmark;

* 9 times number deaths per capita Finland;

* 10 times number deaths per capita Norway;

* 9 12 times number deaths per capita neighbors across Baltic sea (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia). Fuck telling person lose place live. everybody mommy daddy taking care like do. spoiled brat give shit anyone yourself. Think others every awhile. don’t think got man Joke's you, I'm grandparents.  think problem I’ve heard epidemiologists say 75% (or so) population needs vaccine make effective. people believe covid fAKeNeWs make — 30-40% population? Yikes. responsible people's health flu killed 80k 2017 I'm responsible now. 

None us are. Welcome real world.  There's narrative Yes awful. care kids end finishing high school 19 20 still need social skills person education offers one trust anymore. even close. wish, even close. PSA: join US military safe please.

lol safe what? talking covid, guy replying higher chance dying playing football covid. spelled out? Well people lower voice say someone is, know... 
 
It must quite evening. cringe laugh time. Yeah restrictions loosen end hospitalizations plummet. long vulnerable vaccinated, people won’t concerned social distancing. We’re pretty much back normal Florida without vaccine learn read, Chinese 4 vaccines sort developed. either geniouses shitty quality (4? lol). I’m saying I’m sure increasingly large number people thinking.  fuck talking about? never said ""worried getting covid"" point recently. I've already stated numerous times previous comments. 


Quit bullshit one telling can’t wear mask figure much seeing DeSantis handles COVID Bush gone Harvard too. Charles Darwin laughing grave. tickets concert got rescheduled May 2020 February 2021. show gets delayed cancelled, incredibly disappointed state country. Omg, people straight crazy. make shit try make point sound smart. Noone believes bullshit, people read old comment said worried getting covid (hurry, go delete it). Stop lying, makes everything look bad. 
Whatever. think attitude worse dangerous. square. I’m originally Oshkosh (Chicago, now), would seem Appleton compared combination Oshkosh/Neenah/Menasha would nearly offset terms mask usage. 

All family still continue trumpet ignorance (and pro-Trump memes), cousin mine first business owner arrested WI illicitly reopening clearly inessential business pandemic. Good times. Covid wave 1.3 COVID-ing 50,000 people dead. biggie. /s Minnesota...averaging 7% according what? We've never gone 6% ever. pretty consistently 5% less. Same. I’ve eat once, outdoor seating, since March. Fun times. GED courses condense math classes 2 months.

That basic Algebra. fact, think GED test pre-Algebra. know fact GED test advanced math. Also GED thing high school diploma. 

Trig (sometimes known PRE-Calculus) advanced math class. high school take college level math pass calculus. enables students save money graduate high school gen ed classes need college. elementary teachers made students teach classes

/r/ThatHappened Americans embrace herd immunity noticed person support incapable containing virus. justify negligence pro herd immunity basically saying fuck it. primitive approach rico took paid full instead “people get shot every day “ “ people die everyday, b” thats justify deaths. dad can't tell one factual detail ACA. one. things knows fake bullshit Fox news. 

Two children rely ACA even health insurance. 

He's totally abolishing it. pisses off. I'm state mask mandate zero issues finding bars zero restrictions. attorney general likes play whack-a-mole insane fines bars, gonna stop people drinking socializing.

People incredibly it. fear obsession eradicating COVID gonna hurt lockdown advocates election.

That concert could tomorrow remotely afraid go. 6 months told fear virus ultimately scary lost power. surprised lol Right timing won’t work. It’s almost don’t understand science. That’s pretty messed way thinking. Good luck man. Keep safe. YEAH! Sane people know this. friends family navy, talk them! okay right now... whole lockdown seems nothing past 6 months.. still taking risk it’s 1% state. I'll always remember today.

Well hope always remember birthday 6 months since we've known obesity huge risk factor COVID. sustainable rate 1% per week, means average obese person could lost nearly 1/4 weight since March. Instead locked everyone inside made health even worse. elaborate? search guess 😆  severe anxiety getting 0, insensitive twat. hit herd immunity. Felt No? 

I went school Orlando family Florida, I’ve always appreciation it. Im talking people. What’s wrong that? GED courses condense math classes 2 months. compressed much, likely don’t move nearly fast think. elementary teachers made students teach classes teachers kept getting example problems wrong. Kids aren’t missing much saw mask-less dude equally maskless wife shove way past elderly man supposed check people masks entrance Walmart today. 

Where live, like 95% people wearing masks. people wearing masks openly behave like animals. Nobody lifts finger stop them, keep it. Well them, certainly job sector centered tourism love god GO educated yourself... linking article September 2019 pandemic started 2020. fatality rate U.S. 2.9% wrong factual truth right now. 200000 dead people we've still got people sayin dumb shit. I'm afraid virus also want kill people greed unlike know plenty people can't handle virus get people families love people rely them. Unlike previous comments absolutely nothing cowardice like ignorant comments say. post sub called lock skepticism call others cowards caring coward can't handle life restrictions save lives others. find disgusting. think old person wants young generations give lives indefinitely sake his/her safety selfish, disgusting person. old, I’d horrified idea. No, hospitalizations exist % total cases, much tells exactly bad situation is. Sigh. find personal attacks usually start someone can't come good enough counter argument statement. wear mask 30 minutes occasion grocery store can't take seriously anyway essential workers forced wear 8 10 hours 5 days week. total fluff. I'm sure ate up. Cold states hit increases first people wrap spend time inside...the rise death rate follow cold weather south. quickly access information 

Would want nurse Google convert lbs kgs? Would ok nurse Google temporal lobe located? No, would not. Actually knowing things important. I'm accountant promise you, company would hire anyone Google basic information. 

This culture ""I need learn cause Google later"" many stupid people. Knowledge power. job going tell can't research working on. 

Tax laws change constantly, expected know basic tax information top head. didn't, people probably trust taxes. 

I care think, one going trust professional research basic knowledge. attitude common scares me. really hope future. happy comment getting upvoted.

Anyone feels need celebrate make example rare tragic COVID cases young people trash. Good luck, Floridaman. care. prefer dying bar time. Conservatives empathy blame child. Watch. You’re kidding right? testing 30% positive, damned sure under-testing whole lot people infected without getting test. comes second wave. I’m going start considering live band playing coronavirus 2020 “new wave” music. world want us live in, remember that. could open everything back send kids school let people work everything else, would rather lock everyone homes .02% world's population, old anyways, die. Ugh awful. July weren’t even really seeing curve decline. Hoping folks get shakeups post election take seriously.

Hoping see improvement national level too. way we’re beating horrible disease going together. Sweden ramped testing still 1-2% positivity rate. small increase case numbers death. covid-19 - deaths still single digit per day right since least July. increase Covid-19-cases seems small local outbreaks due mostly back university college back work. agree. people written year willing lose another year lives shit. Quit self righteousness. Spanish flu. Many people getting increasingly day fear porn isn’t landing hard anymore, it’s quite obvious. Selfish would expecting doctors treat willing anything stop people getting sick. Oh fuck look. behind you. Facts frees cash flow. F True, true... July Honestly think it’s Cuomo shoved active Covid cases nursing homes effectively killing thousands innocent elderly victims. Also leaders representatives telling go parades go Chinese restaurants didn’t you’re racist. three things Florida. Swimmin', dyin', bath salts. really don’t think don’t find restrictions particularly stifling. ask simply wear mask going business longer don’t problem that, especially means things become open vaccine wear masks them! literally see whoever want outdoors 6 feet great time. also make time call video chat friends family aren’t close by. make minor sacrifices try prevent death already multiple people close passed. get it’s *easy* think there’s difference something genuinely hard people wanting it. personally find rules hard follow think lots fun things still following rules. Lol Even Covid triggering autoimmune disorders illness like comment implies, still whole collection autoimmune issues develop directly person Covid -- Covid, might developed symptoms lifetimes, might taken decades. live south Florida. Lucky I’m introvert prefers staying in. safe ? Lol Imagine paying 50K online degree showcased intelligence. like good ol boys club acknowledges super smart impossible work ethic people well. complex but...idk.

That's unique institutions human history. systems hierarchies tolerate level social mobility. West's ""Rags Riches"" matched ""Pauper Prince"" tales feudal societies, ""Slave Master"" parables slave-owning societies. Carefully curated examples meritocratic exceptionalism helped justify social inequality millennia, modern world exception. one lives middle Australia 😜 almost live cities - much higher population densities Florida. Melbourne, Australia population five million - much bigger Florida city five new cases yesterday. Hospital care improved lot since Spring, UK data show hospitalized fatality rate went 6% April 1.5% June, four fold drop. biggest game changers less aggressive intubation, aggressive anti-coagulation, better timing steroids. improvement hospitalized outcomes specifically due patients younger. would probably cases late fall winter, sense things would worse summer, one expects bad spring. come far prevention treatment.  basically throw match pile gasoline dried Christmas trees?  know y'all, I've learned really like wearing mask. Especially companies selling different patterns.

I like work one able read facial reactions. 

I fully intend keep wearing even covid put bed. see single reason to. They've done Japan, hardly ever get sick. Good luck florida, gonna need it. That's St. Petersburg.  It’s know it’s know vaccine availability go giant step controlling infection, you’re going completely eradicate eliminate it,” Fauci unusual vaccine 100% effective, says. Also, people skeptical vaccinations may avoid getting there’s enough vaccine available entire U.S. population, take time distribute shots. exactly 2nd wave start never leave first wave? Ask /r/covid19. People often give uninformed opinions. can't catch obesity room person.

 Plus there's treatments control obesity there's still cure vaccine COVID. Time fresh TP memes!  Get grip deadly pandemic lieing declaring schools safe! People selfish. Entitled. used living comfy lifestyle bothered bit discomfort. ""The masks make feel uncomfortable"" Idk man. 55x larger space relatively number people... seems sus even compare two wonder sort stipulation high risk better access. Ive afraid year.  I've one warning everyone since beginning work. crazy one. we've test positive people wearing masks little tighter now. 

I've realized starts effect people everyones circle people start take serious. Sad part reacting virus late .... need infront instead. healthy 29 years old coach died Texas day. absolutely horrifying. looks like solid data. you’ll excuse me, I’ll busy sleeping well next 3-4 months. Good, we've stupid restrictions, we're going stand Orwellian bullshit longer. empathy requirement get Harvard ignorant hurts. See, unlike I've lived countries know first hand Americans special kind dumb. shining example. Also, considering fascination it, know actual basement dweller here.  think it’s due fact Florida spread New York close together stacked top other. Trained? poll takers making minimum wage, think proper training proper ppe? LOL incredible people still trust right thing USA.  Well far deaths either New Zealand South Korea took similar measures, yes think possible. That's good deal tbh Source please Nice word. Defenestration agree, next person infect may lucky. I'm wearing mask others whole point. Hell, ate outdoor meal got starbucks. protect live life without going extremes. virus highly contagious issue.

 Another way look risk going bankrupt COVID medical bills option possibly avoid wearing mask? stay away everyone else then. don’t think life like forever. happens viruses like mutate become less lethal time. lockdowns never supposed stop virus tracks. That's virus works. fact closed.

My hunch sent email blast students' parents guardians. Try get info solely people impacted, nobody else.

Thing is, emails documents pop ""Sunshine Law"" request info, other. stay buried; they've stalled things anti-mask anti-vaccine crowd probably quite close two 100% overlapping circles venn diagram. 

I little faith ""MUH FREEDUMS"" people actually getting vaccine. they'll use ""I got vaccine"" 2021 version ""I wear mask"" excuse though, usual, retail workers suffer wrath. Oh well that's USA hard time. We're big country compared rest world know affects heart lungs affects overweight people lot Americans issues that's things bad looking!! 

My mom said felt ""mom infallible really smart"" bubble explode. I'm finishing college state first leaving. state tuition america outrageous. long Fox News runs segment Vitamin could kill makes poor something Brain fog might worse. Could impact earning potential. 

Smell taste mainly would affect chefs / food beverage careerw There's clip Canadian guy spraying cup coffee hand sanitizer curbside pickup unfortunate can't identify trolls anymore since hide reddit age now. one replying seems pretty trolly. Thank you!  US has, first approximation, done absolutely nothing coronavirus. They’ve basically ignored it, compare countries done. Hardly hysterical reaction ... barely reaction all. people seem want celebrate continual failure instead pretending beat back twice. Totally agree. don’t think he’s saying. nothing pass blame everyone else. Lets see.

Crossrail? Still delivered.
Continues bloating wage bill.
Continues destroying road network leading worse pollution.
Destroyed Park Lane. 
Divisive EU.

Untold tube bus strikes

For start. Totally depth unable swim, blames everything everyone else. yah one said positive said negative.. need third test like nasal swab make sure diagnosed properly. KWIS? think 80-90% likely get first symptoms.
Before shows nothing.
At least usually works.
And think 5 days infection symptoms.

If it‘s still like this, enter plane / cruise cross border, test clean.
Then get inferious soon show symptoms. It’s like stadium “wave” travels around. It’s wave, went elsewhere while. guess comes back NYC they’ll probably call new wave enough time separation, it’s really one rolling along. believe reason gay Hispanic Democrats raped children yet hate systematic oppression keeps check, really never going happen. Tiger-Repelling Rock style. easy hold onto beliefs like they're ""proven"" right every passing second thing happen them, ""proven"" even righter something bad resembling stereotypical view randomly happens every 10 years, someone fabricates story like it.

Getting sick real, there's way deny cause, except extreme level denial, still common thing, least universal. Oh definitely. 

It stands reason country densely populated ticking time bomb superspreaders waiting unearthed. European countries Healthcare systems decades ahead us still caught fudge, us folks India ""reported"" numbers remain optimistic delirious about. 

Like, internet-frenzied part population still heaving poop celebrities weed, major news stations prioritizing singular piece obnoxious f\*\*kery days, there's really much else quieter people even get reliable information from. someone doesn’t least 2.5 GPA biz going college

Yes, that's another point rebuting whole ""biased poor students"" issue. Grades high school already inflated ridiculous amount. real problem students occurred way earlier life frankly may beyond state's control (what gonna do, take kids away illiterate parents? go well half country least), sending college solve problems proceed fail out. disagree, America *not* country disregard national public health experts.

Take Israel, example. health experts warned reopen schools last year. Many Israelis, especially Orthodox Jews, tired lockdown point, proceeded open lot anyway. Well, guess what? *Their choice reopen schools caused second wave, prompting second lockdown.* Surprise, surprise. Meanwhile, people begged often much reopening scratching heads, wondering *heck* Israeli government ignoring childish please.

And that's even getting countries *bad* health experts, Sweden, too. Imagine 100,000 PER Day. Think moment. Friday, they’ll what? 500,000 cases? read comment lacking severely comprehension? specifically stated 'natural herd immunity' 'outside vaccination'. pretty basic English. What’s right right. What’s wrong one’s right. wrong. wish people capable seeing attach bullshit political label try defend bad behaviour based newer bad behaviour. historical precedent, body scientific evidence, credible basis could said lockdowns save lives ultimately net public good.

So real question is, justification lockdown? We've never thrown basic civil liberties livelihoods billions dogs like anything history - onus proof demonstrate high degree confidence lockdowns save far lives could destroy?

Since fail spectacularly basic litmus test, proponent them? Asking friend. sure conservative.

Yes, he's quite conservative massive douchebag. flu. would influenza name. might similar style spread.. incubation period extremely long Sars-cov2 compared flu. cant say Flu Corona virus same. not. crazy high ability fight flu naturally cause like said.. around kingdom. Anyways. flu.. killed people caused much economic strife. I'm sorry experience that. used work retail, totally understand concern. miracle get covid wearing mask knew thing. Maybe realize it. That's scary part covid, really know sometimes find late. safe there. died CCP propaganda pushed ventilator use. ventilator would likely survived. well known point ventilator way treat disease. Who’s joking? Mine alive guess win??? !Remindme 5 months AGED well? point time anything well? It’s still comparable, analysis send someone college obviously would able handle course load? waste money. scores easy get students take academics seriously. went high school people scored 30s. poor worked school. didn’t fancy ACT prep classes. put work needed succeed. 

Also went high school large Asian population. parents didn’t speak English. still managed succeed school. 

College isn’t everyone. lower standards, degree mean nothing. school also option take trade school classes free. people graduated high school associates degree trade degree time. Yep, middle class mature enough deal remote learning might ok, expecially good student appropriate learning style.   

If fucked.  couple years behind grade level. Ontario kinda scrambling ramp testing spending summer testing around 30k day. fine 70 cases day. now, tons people need test want one. one considering that... links January first days February. Fox News articles late March, April, May. 

The difference time periods: US REALLY know lot Covid former, one really outside China virology nerds. Italy even surge early March. started figuring things out, real news started reporting left leaning news-tainment too. Fox TV never did, except short days took seriously (before going back ""Sacrifice Elderly Altar Capitalism"" script) EU here, Cant see 5 People average none things u mentioned happening here. clients pretty much they're small group.  Trump promised miraculously goes away April.

He must meant April 2022. hospitals overwhelmed. would news not. 

Like said don’t believe Florida’s numbers 100% accurate don’t think New York’s numbers 100% accurate. media sub obsessed Florida since beginning pandemic want far cases/hospitalizations/deaths have. No. HIV retrovirus integrates human DNA sars cov 2 RNA virus theoretically capable DNA integration. 

But sars cov 2 also unique even compared CoVs lot nasty surprises surprised manages persist manner. mean thing damages heart cells like virus does, infects brain, fucks vascular system yeah, can't really rule anything imo. color

I mean I’m pretty tolerant Dem FUCK cyan. people, I'm afraid still large segment population forget covid go lives. wearing masks revert wearing them. get point, though, see masks ""normal"" lives pre-covid. really don’t understand Pakistan Bangladesh faring better: it’s exact situation Fwiw, I’m healthcare

IF are, administrator, Nurse Doctor even house cleaner.

Take stupid fucking opinion, shut fuck up. Idiots like literally getting people killed. sure Lincoln, check... Roosevelt... thanks correction, I'll edit... would argue it’s pettiness willingness change that’s positive trait. stuck guns prove point, point turned bs accepted switched. hard find views COVID herd/cross failures deserve called scientist first place. Yes plus mention recovery K-shaped recovery winning industries losing industries . people working losing industries depending age flexibility either adapt structurally unemployed feel like fox news caused lot covid-19 positives... Yep! I'm ""essential"" worker, work company that's hard hit basically clawing stay business. Today found department around 25 people going three. already teetering brink burnout. 

Meanwhile, employees working 12 hour days reduced salary finding people reduced zero hours, CEO road trip vacation family.

I seen family almost year able see next. worried one get sick die see again. case cited article, lockdown pandemic per se caused problem.  treatment worse disease?  guess see. Can't gather groups bigger 10 school back baby. First time takes get sick much shorter flu making likely would get symptoms within 2-3 days exposure.. significantly reducing spread ( go home stay home ) incubation period 5-10 days extremely long viral world. that's difference is. exposed influenza long.. level immunity built even virus changes drastically would still herd immunity. Like said virus new. although similarities makes Sars-Cov2 dangerous incubation period contact tracing.

&amp;#x200B;

Not particular strong flu ? yet said killed amout flu would kill 2-3 yrs. hmmm. Fuck capitalist pigs.

\-US Fortune 100 Engineering Team Lead absolutely stunned interview today &amp; [with Florida restaurant owner reopened full asked mitigate spread restaurant honestly said (among useless things) they're making sure use clean cutting boards. Florida much trouble. … plus Black Friday.

But big spike Xmas New Years? Even dullard like could tell precedent ""lockdown"" like this; event like this. see emerging data/evidence economy areas study novel circumstances. know impacts events completed objectively view data. Science make predictions based unknown. Luckily, people world understand ignore people like think figured out. Unless fortune-teller, future, omniscient possible way could say certain spewing come pass. Now, know genius understands fortune-tellers, time travelers future, concept omniscience probable given understand nature reality. Clearly, understand parroting. sure think do, mindful self-fulfilling prophesy confirmation bias, want become statistic prove point. going back stage 1. I'd surprised go back stage 2. argument hear hospitalization still lowish, death rate still low, ok traffic accidents price pay economy, ok corona.


At point beyond tired. addition pandemic madness, news UN recently acknowledged +1.5 degree global temperature increase 2024 latest often back mind. Let's see great perpetual growth based economy put us 4 years. fire lung cancer smoke inhalation probably. idea hospitals continue remain available lockdown restrictions premise none us really data back with.

I think person responding saying hospitals close re-opening.

It sounds like they're arguing *infections* rise great deal re-openings -- independent whether hospitals become filled capacity. friends planned move India back United States back early spring. They're moving November (tickets bought, everything) hope get time. looking good (for either location). Oh. Could be, yeah. living fear. taking every precaution available you. Wearing mask easily part routine, yet acting like sort brainwashing exercise. Loss life expect real problem. Poor countries live deaths due illness time. real problem significant number long term health problems due unable able get initial treatment unable afford care long term problems. millions people heart, lung, brain damage? Thank you. Plenty poor students use program. Tbh, someone doesn’t least 2.5 GPA biz going college. program set students college path. 

I went high school middle class city. lot classmates received TOPS. program created help poor students.  India 90,000 PER DAY. Think moment. Friday, they’ll what? 450,000 cases? yes exist, patterns/instructions pinterest premade ones etsy, etc. sure invest dish soap keep fogging (probably listed pages)   I'm glad diet working you! ailments treat you? probably cases last time hit metric, testing 4x higher then. said, concerning...We saw warning signs nothing. government opened Casinos today. Florida?! 


Hope figure shit soon... trick, treat? Choose carefully. Awwwww love Redditors lash out. front I'd stroke cheek unkempt greasy beard. Standing tall chronically slouched techie standing, toting little mask grocery store. adorable. Imagine easy life would took medical advice medical professionals instead media outlets. fatality rate infected ages 20-49 0.0002 ages 50-69 0.005. numbers don’t take account underlying health issues also attributed deaths. 6% recorded COVID deaths solely virus. Also keep mind 40% test positive asymptotic safe assume many people infected virus recovered means actual fatality rates even lower that. Wait December 2 weeks thanksgiving. Looks like chip manufactured detect one specific chemical. case dog finds difference chemical signaling sick person's sweat. signal might traceable single molecule. dogs detecting smell virus, change smell people virus. Shit sandwich.... Thanks. Lol that's saying. 

Nah employer wants treat like flu. sue catch flu work you? admit policies nothing? believe person responding thinks long hospitals overwhelmed reopening, they're OK infections going up.

It's something personally agree with, that's interpret point. data, another number pulled someone’s ass. helps explain M&amp;M analogy though. Everyone’s convinced they’re gonna grab one 90 normal M&amp;Ms.

That's pretty much got from.  


But tell then, order keep analogy close 'real word numbers', numbers use, retaining impactful message ""the virus serious, protect others yourself'? direct qoute director July - ""Masks protect COVID-19. ""


Ignore want, choice stupid. thought northern border still closed? Shut up. matter. private business sets dress code right deny anyone following dress code. Shirt Shoes Service. individual feels rights violated get lawyer sue, SCOTUS upheld business right deny services many cases.  

There absolutely difference show home demand entry naked. right refuse let in.  want protest mask wearing street corner. Nah it’s condescending morons think medical professionals don’t know anymore idiot Facebook YouTube. 1 MILLION 25 days. Less month.

1,440,000 Election Day, November 3rd. google Tucker Carlson lawsuit. defamation lawsuit. Yeah 100% agree that. stands right bubbles outbreaks happening country like whack-a-mole. think it'll stay like perhaps extreme bubbles point like said start getting second/third lockdowns. I'd like think would create unity I've come realize people believe whatever want matter much evidence right face. good luck! Well first, super high risk. He's 60s, diabetes, also immunosuppressants organ transplant decades ago. even gets fever go hospital it. doctor, thankfully listens to, told never leave house without mask on. Secondly, thanks me, first hand account serious disease cause I'm COVID long hauler got sick three months ago still dealing serious ongoing lung problems. Also seen disease work way quickly around work good enough memory remember much faux news downplaying things got serious I've constantly telling needs take seriously. study started 1932.  Penicillin first used treat infections 1942, 10 years later. soon London went up, know nyc would. Jesus. link story? need read this. shitshow end vaccine

...which, way, probably coming Americans April-August. even then, must continue wear masks majority people vaccinated.

The vaccine *not* ""get mask free"" card. Get it? haven’t addressed grammar mistake mathematician, think called odd numbers.  Yup. Masks work wonders. even get wearing mask, greatly reduces exposure viral load, making mild infection giving immune system time react. threw name - summary point link trying say, expect people hunt Google. Yeah, remember glad crazy 2019 finally over? found unsubscribe button may stupid express opinion matters. Ah time Halloween!   people anyways

some. people anyways.

And almost definition normal Man I'm gonna lie, industry people struggle *normal* year stay open unless get everything right, house family depended ability stay open...I'd very, tempted throw open doors roll dice (a) getting hospitalized (b) bunch people inside getting hospitalized direct result.

Don't get wrong, think stupidest thing imaginable. stupidest. governor called state ""God's waiting room"".

But I'm trying also put restaurant owners' shoes here. half year awful numbers. guess haven’t seen photos Florida bars... jackass! acted like fact seasonal flu takes 2-3 years kill million people means seasonal flu must deadly COVID-19, pointed that's case, reason seasonal flu kills (as hundreds thousands ""few"") people every year many individuals immune various strains given moment. Flu outbreaks generally small relatively contained, nowhere near pandemic levels, spread heavily hindered immune individuals...and yet *still* kills hundreds thousands globally every year. flip script, make COVID-19 disease we've living hundreds thousands years flu novel...well COVID-19 would responsible thousand deaths every year, hundreds thousands, novel flu...well lets say millions would dead already. find simultaneously glad exists sad exist.

And anyone's wondering black people trust official medical guidance they're given, look Tuskegee syphilis experiment. expect? human extinction, higher life extinction life extinction? Question you: What’s opinion California making felony anymore knowingly spread AIDS virus without disclosing people sex?  shut up. US projected 400,000 COVID deaths January, 1/3 population India. 1MM Indian COVID19 deaths huge number US comparably worse shape counted per 100K population. know know... - 33 battled Covid months. struggle warning young adults

I use edited Headlines wanted link Original article Ok mr trump. FYI brother completely wrong survival rate. 

But yeah sucks. would hate that. Thanks answer. still leaves question smell ubiquitous coronavirus strains (I would assume least would no?). Also efficacy. compare rt-pcr future seroconvertion. scientific proof concept research? public? prevalance sickle cell african american genetics effect effectiveness vaccine? mention incredible bonanza hospital business infected people. Hospital treatment covid averages 30k per case

Any increase funds might treating COVID patients more, way more, offset losses hospitals taken they've cancel elective procedures. near impossible go 2 stairs Covid. legs arms useless. muscle wasted away point large gap thighs. lot neurological symptoms persisted months. still there. 

Anyway, sure two would related. Slow testing down, please. 

You'll develop, develop herd, like herd mentality. ""OMG IM PREGNANT, FINALLY!"" 

has party celebrate, actually covid “You’re” means are, literally makes sense conducted 1932 **and 1972** least 6-12 month window appears pretty much enough us hopefully dive across finish line vaccine. guess potentially Northeasterners, shorter end window, would start becoming vulnerable vaccine force. much else. US ever good place according him? billionaires getting even richer. aren’t together. Well I’m atheist hate sports got locked head I’m insistent going sports bars church. able see friends family long inconvenience unless sad hermit personal connection life. Stop treating opinion gospel, everyone shares beliefs. Perhaps mean natural immunity viable, truth vaccination works bringing immunity. I'd say ton people died. Finland much better instance. Poor police infected sure aerosol spread. identify really isn’t point though. mainstream media sources heavily biased day.....which sad parties far important them. wrote another post this...

This way overblown. city we’ve 250-350 cases avg. neighborhoods currently testing 2 percent rapid testing stations deployed them. It’s something keep monitored something cause panic. Headache, Heartache Fatigue confirm. mask discipline terrible whole area’s ticking time bomb. saving grace naturally spaced everyone around here, ask Dakotas much helps people start getting sick First hope get well soon.

Call nearest Hospital doctor ask do. Get tested. meet anybody till get results.

I wish best. Lost smell striking Indicator towards covid.

Sorry english. pubic pressure

Oh, right. help? 2020 motto would *Headache &amp; Fatigue*. M4A?

Do listen Fox? (Might help know they're coming they're going.) 

One interesting approach...some deeply held convictions explanation, moment decided believe x , reasoned choice arising established facts. deeply held beliefs real grounding facts all. believe simply we've always believed them. speak countries ICH/GCP International Code Harmonization Good Clinical Practice. Within countries prisoners considered special population extra protections place. clinical trials require Ethics Committee Institutional Review Board approve study protocols subject safety weigh risks, subjects sign Informed Consent Form written one 5th grade style native language. 

You know doesn’t considerations?? US Military. people sign military actually sign away consent become property military. People wearing masks following social distancing rules increases infection numbers. trusting people charge curing HIV/AIDs? How's vaccine going?

Go on, spell out. What's point? Stop false information bad soul Chicago already announced $1.2B budget hole grows daily tourists, commuters, 90% Loop closed, etc. State Illinois already fiscal zombie $6B hole result this. money state local level keep businesses shuttered indefinitely think federal government riding rescue anytime soon either. ""Looks like April, know, theory, gets little warmer, miraculously goes away.""
- February 10 difference capability. One less capable sun. said yourself.

Other humans capable running fast jumping high, example. I've never heard complaints lack diversity NBA teams 100m final. see people saying **president** 

Normally would agree experience Trump voters area make feel otherwise. 

There also several point DeSantis ""squelch"" talk running POTUS. Well sucks brother jackass, literally everyone work massive republicans republican inlaws/have suffer friends family events consume fucking ton political media - I've never heard anything like that. once. DeSantis office hot minute, I've never heard anyone jumping gun. 

Honestly makes really happy hear. wish experience same. [Here typical brother. Shows priorities are. Hm. kinda like saying ""if wear seat belts, less likely get accidents due influence"".

Because we're assuming wear seat belt religiously, responsible carefree drivers. not? take English class? New lockdowns incoming?  going tell him? part think people *don't* understand? virus stay, think people understand that. It'll passed around like cold flu. 

When people say ""herd immunity"" reached, really mean slow enough spread restrictions go away entirely. Speaking least US, never point 4 infections means lock entire cities. kill stock.

You're wrong, worth noting stock market seem abide logical expectations more. Jackass almighty basement dweller? US 1/3 India population, using cases per 100K population US I’d still worse India.

Think that. Yeah that's unfortunate case locals bringing shit front stoop mercy idiocy. New York City hovered 1 2 % several weeks now. sure ""doubling"" coming from. countried mean?

The countries open life mostly normal dif everything fight it. New Zeeland, Taiwan, China, Vietnam. Maybe time stopped making face masks started making body bags? ....sad times. interested history, read Conflict Orders early Roman Republic. Talks Plebians basically learning organize mostly peacefully call reforms, due Patricians (wealthy families) perpetuating system allows enjoy society. Michele Obama stoped clinical trial looking young black women participate. Yo, I'm arguing whether handling good. justification ""well we've always done things way worked"". 

That's patently false, trying draw argument I'm basis statement *I never made*. [my first comment said free say ideal handling. I've repeated twice now. Making argument entirely separate took issue with, arguing there's historical precedent this. know. I'm sorry, best. Born raised here. Moving now! also get one? - Asking Africa. two week downward trend new cases per 100,000 may something it. However jump doubt reinstate restrictions does.

Depends hospital guest government department name number occasions part annual gala. 

Got it. know sort requirement.

Also several hundred year old building less. Makes sense plumbing would shite. food instability unrest (to put extremely mildly) third world countries since long covid 19 came along heard even worse, it’s like 99.98%, actually ten times less said never argument. I'm sure talking about. seem arguing argument never made. confused? holy shit take number multiply another number get new number promise? Someone, please show Fauci. also maintaining one lowest literacy highest poverty rates. 

don't fool ma'am Good lord didn’t know that. really gotta get together Oh imagine that. almost like EXACTLY we've trying tell people Life rough. Feel free hide bubble forever rest us live lives. India far deadlier contagious diseases endemic. contagious disease .5% IFR rare developed world, isn’t unusual world typhoid dysentery. Also quite young country, 65% 35. much risk Covid elderly, India fewer elderly people likely far lower average IFR elderly country like Italy. 

That said, resources ability socially distance due poverty, they’ll tools reduce spread. percentage people lingering effects? dangerous and/or debilitating effects? month since explosion cases/day Wisconsin (started ~9/1). average death / day remained quite steady. gone anything. assume due fact increase cases mostly driven 18-24 age group. groups minor up-tick. suprising, cities / areas heaviest hit UW compasses. 

Wisconsin total 571 Covid+ patients hospital. 166 ICU. additional 210 inpatients COVID test pending. Assuming 210 positive (571 + 210 = 781) would account 6.83% beds Wisconsin (781/11,436). terrible situation, think screwed... yet... Ikr? Especially visiting European Mediterranean ports ... Ship Fools? Ahh, see confusion. That's describing entire 25 cohort, biased downard due low death rates children. break 15 cutoff, appears 16-25 bit higher COVID. Sounds good; think he's saying? Rapid...rape-ed!  bad headline lol, course young people risk severe illness COVID-19....it's rare yea there's still risk. would dumb putting headline ""There risk severe complications influenza young people.""

Every time get ill risks complications, that's nature human body. Rarity remain seen little understand virus (and limited scope research viruses well prevents solid baseline comparison). course misinformation, nobody informed ***BASIC*** levels diseases like COVID would support necessary usually cruel inhumane ways actually *reach* herd immunity would involve subjects hundreds thousands forced infection endless deaths would greatly outweigh benefit. 

It safer, easier effective flat **wear masks social distance** humane ""Cure"" available vaccine follow vaccines every year becomes needed COVID. biggest issue herd immunity applies communities get infected enmasse, given US spread are, traveling herd immune Floroda herd immune Colorado cause infect mass amount people due every state willing cause mass death avoid smallest inconvenience. 

Those push herd immunity anything less wide spread death avoid maube 2 second inconvenience social courtesy idiot best, Florida's case, living, breathing monster worst. reach herd immunity pipe dream that, made goal, would kill entire communities real benefit, even going long term problems. And, always, want misinform COVID based money power, nothing else.

Edit: stidies believed masks alone give small dose virus full blown infection. Logically means masks also lower need vaccine herd immunity assuming build antibodies. Yet herd immunity crowd wear them.  Yea hear media talks sushan singh questionable death, corruption bollywood 5% global population, 20% global deaths. Nice job, Trump. need balance sense urgency known good discipline process. Skipping steps, short cutting may work great. Best case scenario. Unfortunately, unintended side effects common side effects, especially talking drug probably taking, could even catastrophic though less evident initially. 

This sucks, it. skipping procedures made calmer times, based trials failed, recipe disaster. true case, true time panic something done. lot quotes, almost data. want see number animals got infected treatment group compared controls. reduce viral replication nasal passages 96%, would likely reduce odds treated person would infect someone else, would prevent infection treated person, virus typically enter lungs replicate there, making way airway later. good freak doubling increase  No, poor struggling sick people. pastors mega-churches senators influencers deserve mocked spreading ignorant opinions getting smacked reality.

Ordinary people struggling deserve compassion, sorry implied otherwise. didn’t though; could prepared pandemic provided mental health services; it’s zero sum game People take calculated risks risk others time. Show someone never sped car life I’ll show liar take this. Living communities higher seasonal inoculation rates mean living community higher confidence public health officials. group likely understand social benefits seasonal flu shot probably open wearing mask socially distancing well. [here mask on. doesn’t really feel different I’m using it, mainly I’m also wearing secondary laryngofoam filter underneath it. become issue, however inner filter becomes clogged mucus. never said was? stated logical fact given rate spread, it’s logical India 10M confirmed cases US does. Nowhere say “I can’t wait see gets 10M first!” “India definitely beat US, it’s matter time!” That's counter. paper virus also isinfects t-helper cells. negate facts original article immune system works. explain immunity even t-helper cells compromised. Fed like $4 trillion go “prop up” Trump. Everyday people serve power, near everyday. Maybe stop, figure way illustrate power side. large multi-national organizational structures rely heavily government foot bill rely rich countries like United States pay biggest part bill. Guess side willing pay bill even overpay it? Hint: It’s Republicans. hassids good. lockdown proponents putting people risk insisting people go lockdown? see job losses, depression, isolation cause.

&amp;#x200B;

edited grammar vaccine makes someone anti-vaxer. Exactly.

There's even official calculator shows long virus survive surfaces depending temperature seem like social toll ignored around since someone brings every minutes.

Mental health managed personal basis. Pandemic response managed community level. People mental health issues deserve helped. understanding, help available seek it, maybe wrong that. even France South Korea. It’s like saying “jUsT lOoK MoNtAnA 100 CaSeS DaY wHeReAs CaLiFoRnIa 10K! GeT sHiT ToGeThEr CaLiFoRnIa! mOnTaNa bEtTeR thIs!” Agree disagree statement. 

I think reinfection possible, likely cases. Antibodies immune response. minimum decrease symptoms reinfected. severe reinfection, majority asymptomatic mild. 

When compared coronaviruses cause colds, they've done studies 30-40% infected second time exposed. 10% third time. 

So think people second infection built good amount immune response. However, think puts natural herd immunity away many hope. Vaccination way. CDC suggested Bandanas sufficient form PPE knew compromised again. Florida weeks +100 deaths day. reach less 10 day week sure give Florida nod. It’s another article peer-reviewed appears reputable. wouldn’t surprised mechanism possible lower respiratory tract infection, requirement severe CoVID-19. case, treated Leronlimab free democratic society could erected

Peasants, farmers, kids, manner commoners buy democracy blood. Lots lots blood.

That's experience.

All along way millions cops beating murdering you...and soldiers same...and bombs.

And ""they"" immediately start trying pervert steal you. yes. Think diseases got herd immunity zero influence humans vaccines. false choice. liberals love play Whataboutism game someone calls bullshit. Grow fuck up. Lol whuuuh?

Of course company tank economy COMPANY po  li    cs aka dumbasscrats want shut economy. Hence say workers rights would last concerns. Jeez yall sjw can't see actual picture. family's theory many people due good practices vaccines lifestyle display symptoms. really allowed spread news given fines+jail time, one knows sure. Worldwide? Meanwhile Cuomo like

""Quick get nursing homes!!""  remember trained African Medical school.. credentials questionable... sure got certified practice US Fox News wasn’t news station saying COVID wasn’t big deal. I’m gonna copy paste comment made similar topic multiple news stations saying masks weren’t important would say relates › 2020/01/27 › (This one changed cause realized Fox News issue, it’s every news issue, didn’t want spread panic guess? Ableism bad homophobia, don’t think think it’s OK say “retarded” (which gay autistic person think bad “F” word, would also quote example’s sake didn’t think mods would remove comment it) think deeper really think kids wife works with. does. Problem is, stupid celeb president* now. Redditors never let reality get way spreading misery. honestly like lot people WANT corona stay around reason hate president.

If that's reason ""hating"" President reading news every day, anyway, last four years. find year never ends.  would matter Fox viewers actually cared. don't. That's point. shame. care self reflection. care hypocrisy. Documenting they're (repeatedly) wrong effect. revel others upset inconsistencies refusal act objectively.

I know right approach *is*. certainly worked. like fact checking websites worked. like series damning tell-all books worked. like pairing Trump's previous statements current ones worked. know, spitballing Let’s honest, “other” networks nothing op-ed opinions entertainment purposes touched wait Dr. [Anthony] Fauci’s seal approval reopen America, may America reopen.” June, Ingraham enough pandemic altogether. “The president campaign simply react alarmist COVID drivel out,” said.

But big push saying ""we can't let cure worse disease"" ghouls pushed longest time. Throw 'blind' got hat trick. 

I mean honestly kid, trying accomplish here? going change mind I'm going waste time trying change yours. Absolute morons... close hit 3%. primarily Jewish holidays Labor Day People take calculated risks time. take behalf. put people risk.

People take attitude ""I'll probably survive maybe let's get exposed anyway"" deplorable  Bronx, Manhattan Richmond like record low case rates moment. entirely Brooklyn lesser extent, Queens. already proved that's true.

No, didn't.

Flu season December February. really seen temperate regions winter yet (the temperate band southern hemisphere comparatively sparsely populated, far south, largely contained virus winter hit). level spread saw spring summer could reduced transmission rate.

Literally every single respiratory virus displays seasonal pattern. would one different? matter? uncle dead pandemic, cares old was? loss less tragic he's old? rely idea everything reported accurately though? comments saying true, numbers fudged heavily Indian government. would nice. shit not? I'm confused - DeSantis run president already? 

Because not, see saying relevant - point Voldemort gov 8 years point anyone suggest run president, nobody suggested DeSantis run president. concerning indeed world Fauci, listen em. Including China. also know US government experimented Blacks made sure give treatment known infections. order measure infection killed them. US government knew syphilis endemic Black Population Tuskegee. knew cure. wanted see effects Syphilis later stages. rather provide antibiotics needed cure Black Men.. told fine... died.

They fucking CURE... Penicillin.... didnt give it

lets even start Gynecological Surgeries ""perfected"" unwilling black female slaves Yes, does. Glad understand. first scientifically confirmed cases reinfection completely different genome sequence, would sequence ‘flaring again’. evidence inactivated covid cells reactivated body. Smart ass gets flu shot would definitely practice social distancing. true, wouldja look hypocrisy downvotes puppets left😂😂 Obesity epidemic states left 2 thirds Americans overweight half obese. Ask average person around 27-29 BMI they'll think they're fat even think skinny. Get obese numbers people think ""a little overweight.""

There's studies parents thinking obese children healthy weight.

Obesity common states we've forgotten healthy body looks like. think you\`re overreacting. Maybe convince parents least keep extra distance people. hard commit quarantine see ""source"" lmao - literally proves wrong selectively quoted parts try bluff read it. one constant truth year, every single cope people held to, shattered absolute pieces months go on. 10 months delusions blow face can't teach pragmatism, maybe hope practical, realistic thought begin with. mask use damn near universal new york. percent positive metric juke amount healthy people testing. Hopefully Ben Carson one them. Bruh, kinda wish Florida kicked US became Caribbean country. also go around saying things “so gay”? I’m also gay tell experience that’s level insensitivity you’re right 1) People congregate indoors extremely hot outside too.

2) gatherings summer winter, schools summer vacations.

3) depressed immune systems invalid excuse covid infections. Strong immune systems guarantee wont avoid getting huge viral load somebody. countless cases, posts sub confirming that.

Quit spreading misinformation. Cruise ship people like E. Coyote lol incredibly tragic:( know amount cases considered excellent job. human lives we're talking about. live Milwaukee proper.

The first night masks made mandatory aware. went gas station saw ""no mask, service"" sign door first time. like 3 blocks home, went back home got mask. started leaving spare mask car.

I gas station like 10 minutes shit not, time least 3 ""rednecks"" (in quotes live far north one get US; people act like southerners never south literally retarded) drove up, saw sign, got visibly pissed entered store anyways. could hear grumbling. Pretty sure one even little cracks voice like teenage going puberty it. fucking insane. people always type can't afford food always carton cigarettes drive Ford F-250.

Of course clerks say anything. people 1 unpleasant conversation away mental breakdown public lockdown. never know who's going take ""please wear mask"" ""I fucked mother"" WI surplus useless people attitude. opposite also true then, right? Anyone suggesting antibody presence thing contributes herd immunity pushing another agenda far front science. Or? Per [this NYT Covid Ontario (13.5M) 371 cases per 100,000 people.

Florida (21M) 3,265 per 100,000 people. lay people, immunity means can't infected, binary. Either immune, not. word ""resistance"" better expresses intended meaning. ""Herd immunity"" sounds like magical point disease dies off, concept really rate transmission disease slows people become immune. herd grows increasingly resistant transmission virus. point specific article explains many people (by age) get serious consequences? article says may happen (and course know even kill, even serious consequence), say anything common cases. really refuse treatment anyone refuses covid. waste resources could save someone's life someone spread get's again. think there's ever vaccine harm *someone*. cases last years rushed vaccines causing harm promised. hear shit happens developing countries, time around rich world learns like guinea pig. hear you, skeptical testing policy, (of course cases low dont test) approaching year taiwan experiencing spikes whatsoever terms excess deaths etc. spikes pneumonia respiratory illnesses lengths go contact tracing extreme. Like, Orwellian levels figuring went with. I'm iffy detail recently japanese case (I think) tested positive Taiwan govt tested like 3000 people potential contacts negative .

There widespread temp checks mrt etc, mandatory temperature checks etc going work, public buildings venues. school teach, teachers periodically fill forms stating symptoms etc . boss basically begged write dogs could bring world scrutiny upon school. (I wrote anyway) cases animals contracting covid 19.

I certain taiwan would hit hard eventually seems like govt actually successful thus far.

plus (and say love) taiwan nation busybodies. people dropping covid jot hope hell govt would able keep quiet. particularly user-friendly sources this? Yep, add CNN MSNBC shit pile lol would one love blog. interferon hypothesis gives alternative explanation besides t-cell cross reactivity people get sick others ok covid-19 infection. Also classic ""what's solution then?""

Man, see something wrong know solve it. pretentious would be, think everything think way? know solve fascism. Trump would claim 6 million cases excellent job. Can't make everyone happy. Learn truth now. always gonna villain someone elses story. Always. allowed dock. Im saying long term effects don’t exist. 
1. long term effects needs long term study those. it’s long term it’s either permanent damage simply long term effect 
2. make plausible argument. Million(s)of people must infected far rule exception effects u described (which doubt) occurred.

So say is: Don’t overstate effects. Don’t make rule know it’s existing rule rate going, Wisconsin come close matching Michigan's cumulative death metrics. even ball park. Lol think upset liberals too? Another swing another miss. Classic. virus comprehension thing policy

I even know means. matter virus ""comprehends""-- actions consequences, policies results. 

Effective public policy one considers, acknowledges, works human behavior. meets people middle. Bad policy one not. That's see abstinence-only sex education fails time time, despite zealously proponents believe young adults scared sex, sexual activity human desire coded human nature. That's sex ed programs *acknowledge work with* human behavior effective-- teach kids relative risks STDs, gives tools still sex safer fashion. 

What calling basically abstinence sex ed. Hopefully rise. 8 weeks since cases started rise see trend one soon. Canada gift incredibly low population density. Sounds worthy new Supreme Court nominee. sure you’re referring Rachel Maddow ? Souls Oh see, created coronavirus get people take flu shots /s  feel like identifying what's people noticing first time years time take notice. took time look family history I'm pretty sure I've got undiagnosed issues, getting checked almost impossible things get back normal people stop caring cycle continue. Everyone turned thing political. Trump Trump shit instead unifying like said, Nancy saying Trump racist one thing actually relatively well (travel ban). bad can't get dipshits figure anything without trying make dipshit counterpart look bad / worse. sickening. Asymptomatic like [up 3/4 flu maybe asymptomatic like [most cases maybe meant like [most cases check distinctions true whole bunch diseases react way trying make argument. Yeah, America cultivated incredibly toxic culture ""if give person amount money, matter small, acceptable treat poorly want."" people play along it, realizing harms much harms clerk they're screaming at. going eventually end soft science programs, like humanities majors, losing credibility overstepped boundaries long. 

Either that, hard sciences forced toe line order keep funding.

Unfortunately, universities businesses businesses need keep customers happy. customers kids believe crap religious fervour (not fault; generations raising really dropped ball, despite warned repeatedly would happen). seems absurd people would go university order get education, tell educators what's true (why go school think know everything already?). seems reality live in.

I think particular brand anti-intellectual nonsense end far damaging nonsense end spectrum (like creationism climate change denial) people believe stuff either already went uni decades ago, planning going anyway. make difference universities' bottom line. Fox News made &lt;insert literally exponentially worse. Uh ok, what’s theory Washington, Nevada, New Hampshire?  Dont bring small stone fruits Wow, pretty ignorant statement. 

Not much argue there. Everything wrote pretty much contradicted existing literature coronaviruses. example 1 year 67% volunteers challenged coronavirus developed illness subsequent safer assumption coronavirus act like rest coronaviruses immunity wane relatively quickly 6-12 month timescale mild disease, persisting longer severe cases.

And neutralizing antibodies matters comes sterilizing immunity producing herd immunity.

You correct reduced severity illness subsequent reinfection, contribute herd immunity person still infected still pass on.

And safely assume case SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses, like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1. circulate human population persist, never acquire herd immunity them, reinfected 6-24 months later. went say, ""I probably say want keep slightly wraps.""

But that's stopping it, cost limiting incurred rest time. go away, willing limit contact people, lock populations homes, close businesses, rest things countries did, yes limit it. 

Until relax. comes back. lock things again. Lather,rinse, repeat. Spain, UK France, too. moment - weeks even - 'just' 500 deaths per day 'good' news. Republicans make anything political/racial issue. give shit local national, innate need inject politics race every fucking facet stupid, ignorant, non-passport-having-never-left-their-shitty-state lives.  embarrassed American point, beyond that, I'd embarrassed even attempt defend it.

FTFY

Only 1 political party US bigoted, attempt say Democratic party ""just bad"" ignorant gaslighting. People say mocked viciously completely ignored.

There's room 1 fascist party America position already filled. Tomato, tomato. That’s gets upvoted sub though. gets upvoted rural Midwesterner lives small town, likely never graduated highschool, isn’t educated enough know risks virus dying horrible way. going believe, leading expert immunology infectious diseases stating widely accepted science based actual studies

You mean like Professor Sunetra Gupta? complete misinformation. Stop spreading bullshit. true all. Muslims argue Islam non Muslims thousands years. 

It's characterization arguments make people like Hitchens suspect. OH NO! People actually want something fun besides staying home watching original programming Netflix consuming products Amazon dot com? outrage! Get rid idiots. heyheyhey, insult butts like that. Butts respectable innocent, can't say conservatives. Oh sub gonna play ""no true Scotsman"" every single place uptick. saw Europe summer long great job America failed. Whoops, Spain/France reporting cases per million America now. New York, city hit hardest, city everyone pointed one took seriously, starts uptick old song. 

Turns humans gonna human, virus gonna virus. Floridumb. genuinely want ask hell voted? people pissed guy above.

It rule government. going break thier rules prepared outcome!

They ones damage killing country. Aww man think live brutal awakening... world better place everybody things way.

Well yes. fact, seemed admit previous response, whether intended death toll lockdowns reach 10 million? know, maybe. think lot people going starve death, world.

I'd rather millions upon millions people starve. one year pandemic affecting people near age death nothing compared effects decades worth excess poverty people many cases young whole lives live.

But keep deferring selection ""experts"" unable articulate intelligent evidence based argument words, sound like smart individual (LOL) Great news furry community! 19yr old son recovered fairly easily heart attack months later. He's healthy, comorbidity, active kid. hard time motivating get bed.  find disturbing ""family"" easily ready pretend members exist people suits TV. I'm contact exfamily divisive media landscape. lockdown unfortunate effect economic attrition rich always win. Good you. reported misleading mod. point let people die? man problem now? bad point. hypotheses flu shot vaccines helps train immune system don’t understand surprise confusion. US drowning anti-intellectuals believe ignorance important empathy critical thinking. go long enough, we’ll get someone even worse Trump. below-average intelligence people lead increasingly below-average leadership. historical work describes conditions time period, including contagion, testing, isolation face masks. Average Republican Domestic Terrorist?

Bad people sides Due pandemic. lockdowns months. link phase 2 results? look day find it. last properly heard July preliminary results investors seemed go absolutely silent ages, despite sounding like far releasing proper results. seems happen infuriatingly often potential treatments. *a new HBO special emerges* Red Cross testing blood antibodies couple months, would like see numbers. still selection bias, less dialysis patients, would think. Long haulers exist. Also even asymptomatic patients suffered internal damage. You’re ignorant fuck wits. I, that's probably Hannity's logic, thought people resistance bail early scare.

My thoughts came showering feeling drowning flow showerhead. water came yet felt suffocated thought probably avoidable. still understand mechanics, Hitchen showed difficult endure surely i'm wrong :) Randomly commenting say, bass player love username. lashing again. Lashing convince people right, filled emotion.  mom nurse St Luke's (in MKE) told numerous times COVID-19 nothing worry about. fact, gets confrontational mocks people do. 

I'd tell thinks way, sub's auto-mod remove post do. limit virus small outbreaks tens hundres. Anyone critical Islam labelled Islamophobe left. long religion habit denying science It’s already swayed. Citizen petitions used Pharma various thing, namely patent extensions, also campaign get drug approved. Even doesn’t work. take everything John Campbell says pile salt too. thought already concluded could get COVID recovering?

Doesn’t seem like herd immunity thing. ineffective, still cruel. Ok. Thanks explanation. Appreciate it, even though wouldn’t consider opinion piece. scientists payed off? Oshkosh getting hit really hard right now(#3 according nyt) university. girlfriend works clinic children employees college students. Zero cases summer. Last three weeks 4 cases 40ish employees. Basically linked going bars. super frustrating everything I've still stay home week twice direct contact work people tested positive. Luckily work home somewhat I'm sure people get paid going probably spreading it. 

The Fox Valley 118(14%) beds hospital beds open currently. 9/1 today gone 13 covid patients 103. give us two weeks point hospitals full.  bought pounds flour yeast local restaurant. We've gone flour, still tons yeast. SARS virus flu. realized dear leader majority party starting look bad failed response, make political issue, means using lying, obfuscating, spin employ everything else.

And fucking morons watch ate up, continue eat up. May choke. chance.

Was dig population overweight, weight-ist piece shit? dare you.

If thin enough chase down, done for. Never said easy; nation simply refused provide resources needed effective lockdown provided zero resources mental health well. Pretending deadly virus doesn’t exist/isn’t bad mental health care common cold caused interesting, know much this. Thanks info. guy's still alive? autism give fuck. so, there, morally neutral now. Imagine typing paragraphs actually trying defend saying retarded. could say save effort pettyness turns positive trait.  Florida, state income tax, depends sales tax receipts institutes like bars Disneyworld stay afloat.

Ding Ding Ding, winner ! large number right-leaning retirees want dollars themselves, support community live.  Super Karen, like super-massive black hole, worse. two grandchildren return school week. It’s utter insanity given stats COVID. guy egg face realizes made huge mistake.

Even speaking prevents one person going party better nothing.

I respect previous actions one.  Biased* residential neighborhoods actual homes state reserved senior living. Remember things allowed open gigantic multinational retail stores, local businesses weren’t deemed essential shut down? already debunked months ago? site look legitimate. Aside early pandemic, running projections based current growth rates finding entire world would infected within 2 months nothing changed, think there's point reality better expected. Would really want look 5-6 months future know death toll would double now, say half vaccines running one reason another major supply issues 2-3 approved?

I remember show keep thinking ""this worst day life..."" followed ""c'mon now, cheer - worst day life *so far!*"" keeps getting worse, matter thought breaking point everyone pull heads asses cooperate, comes goes nothing changes. Virus arrived US Feb, peaked April. 

They started reopening late May. peaked July. 

So late August reopening means peak October. India nationwide lockdown. believe China targetted lockdowns Dying pint. know what? actually does. personally know anybody anybody actually infected. Still bet people work we'll hit 1k+ cases day end September.

I say head back lockdown, guy bet says head back stage 1.

Good thing opened schools, bars, casinos :) studies showing even unreported cases still wouldnt make India higher US unreported cases too. Maybe ignorant understand, since prob never India, men women around lot less US. rape date rape. makes complete sense even unreported cases India far fewer rapes China model world responded 

1. Massive testing 
2. Required masks (no exceptions)
3. Quarantined sick 
4. Effective lockdowns (not half assed) 
5. Correctly used predictive computer models (evil app based phone data) 

Many people scream authoritarian response lack personal rights agree with, 9 months global pandemic still can’t go restaurant idiots can’t bothered wear mask correctly stay home sick So? absence evidence doesnt mean evidence absence. India million plus tests day till last two weeks numbers increasing. numbers start decreasing suddenly data becomes suspect? 

Logic: 404 Found Canadian bunch packages stuck US PO Box get border closed. I'd find way smuggle could bring mail, would require Wile E. Coyote-style planning, methinks. one thing making lockdown (my wife locked much still, job stay home I’m screened daily) hard us, go it’s like, “well everyone out, one else locking down... still necessary?” course know is, seems like something wrong. advocate getting rid old ones? Shut downs come, case case. Many business shut already. know Friday night, cops downtown ensuring bars restaurants shut midnight. Fucking total asshole. OK, someone take one them? not? Get flu shots everyone start taking vitamin supplement doctor recommends it. two things found reduce mortality get it. 

Stay fuck indoors stay safe. Passed remember age. drank much overweight. actually lost close 40 pounds around time. went doctor said everything OK. Body good hiding stuff age unless something happens you. Cocaine *has* (very) legal uses oddly enough? know used paralyzing agent eye surgery anyway... I’m really activism. gladly comply laws set enforce advocate new ones. long Trump come support it, may cheap effective treatment? Flint, MI? point avoid overwhelming hospitals. don’t really need general public completely vaccinated.

Half people it, don’t even notice it. vulnerable vaccinated, case counts hospitalizations likely plummet. social aspect. people incentive “sty home” point. likely won’t. Pandemics ALWAYS end socially end medically. Well, still sounds terrible. I've paid grand total nothing every emergency department visit life Australia. Glad still friend. Sorry misinterpreted context question.

Work Oak Creek. confirm. formulating all-virtual plan, reversing course due community outcry, OC schools started in-person learning today. DUMB.  *reported daily cases

It’s good idea say reported people make lot bad assumptions forget difference reported vs actual. Well guess got F statistics then, since exact thing.

So paper broad body research links social isolation loneliness poor mental health, data late March shows significantly higher shares people sheltering place (47%) reported negative mental health effects resulting worry stress related coronavirus among sheltering-in-place (37%). 12 million next month, due lack efficient testing knows Thanks. think started summary earlier version similar source lost link it. I'll definitely add least Smallpox details mine. No, would false, rising based reinfections, that's something recognize true possibility new reinfections rising time second wave, study made another state country (Brazil).

However, done properly, side effects would limited

It’s like treating cancer patient half needed dose chemo. Don’t listen person. happening lol. single tragic cases? 
You always find exceptions rule. 
What 2 million infected without issues ? Short like altruism social score bullshit would NEVER manipulated rich... think so. Err look hysterical nonsense everyone says  reference - 100 cases day long while.

Then opened schools, bars, restaurants. 

My personal bet end September we'll seeing 1,000+ cases day - lockdown reinstated. person bet says we'll head right back stage 1 lockdown end October. Fox continues downplay severity disease. given recent spike hospitalizations, clear death rate going within next weeks. thing happened every state similar pattern. countries think ""real lockdown?"" exactly entail? Gen P 2 days ago !!! admit selling gd Sorry slow weekend replies. take average Seasonal Flu range get 470,000 deaths per year. start COVID deaths December 2019 two months add 12-month currently-measured ^[1] COVID death total. Continuing (questionable) extrapolation based current average daily deaths could get us 1.4M deaths 12 months. would 3 times single year flu deaths. shift ""year"" start March things really started ramp totals ratio would get larger. projected total deaths 23M - subject great variability many possible reasons effects - would 50 years average Seasonal Flu deaths, would also come across least several many years.

Someone earlier pandemic say Modeling agree with: Models generally worst-case outcomes use make decisions eliminate horrible conclusions. actions change models, continue minimized negative effects much can. Successfully responding models make look like models wrong. 

[1] implied H1N1 data 1,000x cases almost 20x deaths retrospective studies compared reporting event, one strong estimate real COVID numbers long pandemic done. OP. mix. 

I live near Boston lot popular trails (especially shorter ones near city) crowded. generally need wear mask time within 0.5mi lot. 

If we're along hike strenuous hike, usually take masks around 75% put see groups. 

We gone hikes New Hampshire season. Sugarloaf, need mask often. Flume Gorge, took mask 5 min break middle. Correction. Boomer paranoia plunging millions extreme poverty. started auction become one punching, break eBay. far things, introvert friends getting antsy too. RT Pravda nodding taking notes. Keyword 'reported'. Keep whining men oppressed, soft boy. ya winning, son? know anybody might help, help anyone. 

That logic sounds familiar. problem, I'll say it. introverted dork. ""I sold them"" = part problem. friend brother's died OD Xanax alcohol. couple regular hook-ups exactly people like you. Seems like 6-7 weeks magic # 4 1/2 - 5 go “ugh oh” boom  showed links contain links actual studies. denialist. countries think ""shut everything down?""  

And would full quarantine actually work country like U.S. considering size, population, rural nature, distrust government, etc.  envisioning tens thousands military personnel city arresting people left house? conceivable reason think that? control-z change past control-y repeat it. People doctor point last year basis pull excuse, even still sort don't. People badly underestimate wrong without necessarily showing signs symptoms. Ever heard irony? Plus Papa tool bag. slowed massively everywhere, point another. Manaus, rise they're shutting down. :/ anyone actually believe vaccine nonsense? vaccine proven safe effective, including Chinese ones. Yes give thousands people without reported issues. what? Since believe whatever Chinese say?

After all, proven covid cure injected disinfectant, know. painful we're talking money.  Imagine top 1% contributing, instead holding wealth watching suffering. Definitely possibility. read article well then. That’s I’m saying. Yeah, ones hold small offices (the Deputy Director Parks Recreation Department example) possess cutthroat sociopathic tendencies narcissism required claw way ladder competition FFS. Definitely unhealthy weight least really need go back calling fat asses.... fat fucks fucking slobs obese whales. 

it's good. 

no, healthy. fat piece shit eats much. article aimed investors.  World meter behind half million cases account excess deaths. Heh. [Found Thanks. Virus magically disappear. Virus disappear there's one could spread lockdowns harsh halfassed. 

All East Asian SEA countries contained virus China somehow still dealing outbreak? would thought would clear given context here, clarify -- acceptable level death covid US (or wherever live)? depends definition normal, level risk. 

Dr Fauci gives late summer / fall 2021 we’ll back sort normal. think lots things normal (Heck, Florida’s “normal” now.)

People live / visit high-risk need carry guidelines longer. folks continue avoid eat-in restaurants cinemas huge crowds longer — much longer depend many get vaccinated, good vaccine is, community spread are, etc. Right! like upvoted comments. I'm sure lockdown like live please try find community. Join D&amp;D group video game league church that's thing. Try get top still alright, I've got experience depression gets bad, almost impossible climb hole own. Maybe 600 million, 6 million seems low. protests going India new farm bill people wearing masks lowering speak. combination able afford masks knowing exactly serious COVID is.

But really ***very*** high population density though.

It moderate most. can’t analyze Florida data. know right? Especially swipe text phones auto correcting words typos really say much. Make show 2021 numbers? 200k dead? Sign S1 Ow Balls.

Congrats USA!

So happy you, soon top 3 like always wanted. big 'yikes' entire thread. It’s actually closer 1.5 million account excess death strictly covid deaths (not bullshit make closer 2 million like suicides, delaying healthcare,etc.) Right! Deniers fall ill denied medical treatment seems logical. hope flour yeast list too. I'm regular baker finding flour yeast iffy spring.

Same, buy jar time loaf two away running one point, managed get like half pound sub jar (guess shopper assumed weight volume) I'm running close one, excess flour, sprung making sourdough starter backup plan try save existing yeast. backup backup plan get low yeast use jump start (even sourdough) starting dough drying like would dry sourdough starter.

That seems American logic.... common thread research lack substance called interferon helps orchestrate body’s defense viral pathogens infused treat conditions infectious hepatitis.

However would interesting see actually crew contracted virus TUI encouraging customers move holidays Crete allowing Cruise ship nearly 1000 people dock there? Fox News represents, encourages, absolute worst parts American spirit - uncompromising entitlement, anti-intellectualism pathological narcissism. they'd literally rather kill people change stances. Hell, they'd rather die *themselves* change stances. Parasites usually good sense fully kill hosts. Fox News. almost getting political. Stubborn guy outdated mindset, willing ""lose face"". Yeah, look people causing anxiety attacks responsible population trying argue made lie realize much damaging society years. kind all. thought blue lives matter? Oh, coronavirus impedes freedumb? Correlation equal causation. could likely get flu shots also much careful distancing wearing masks father similar, brother mother died week it.

Boomers small minded nature. real. Try something help others balance out, helped me. started fundraiser work local animal shelter, partly something feel good about. go one, go sure sounds like sheep talk exaggerating. ""According Nielsen ratings, median age Fox’s audience 66 2016."" half viewers this. ""I mean sure ONE drunk driver killed family minivan think tens thousands drunk drivers get home fine!"" NYT tracker underreporting. check much India underreported deaths. Plus reports mass dying India also reports overwhelmed hospitals compared countries. likely young age Indians helping felt like body repairing tissues whatever vitamin came tore fix right? painful. believe death numbers bullshit specifically western intelligence agencies caught burning bodies first month, never know.

China fast response; able shut domestic air rail travel around Wuhan control spread virus almost night.

We, United States, couldn’t even stop plane loads infected travelers Milan steaming New York every day people sick dying weeks 8+ years would put last recession... doubt doomsayers going awhile c'mon lol  No, actually due red hat man...all it.

JFC settle little guy. didnt say socializing makes rape them. obvious society like India places women men socialize less opp rape. US higher rape rate true know, experts also tell that. However educated guesses herd immunity last throughout crisis. reinfections fortunately exception. cases reinfection cause severe diseases, Covid-19 might end common cold virus like sibilings. Thank goodness! they'd told truth would've run around hands air screaming, instead bought toilet paper. lot people poor, living slums street, close contact others able get tested lack access. highly doubt numbers accurate even close accurate. impossible account every case even every death. I'd pay give Hannity spinning back fist. Yeah I’m totally disgusted selfishness display. “My fun important countless human lives” objectively awful thing say apparently someone simply asks wear mask vaccine exists! It’s like train track problem except instead choosing save one group other, people decided take steering wheel drive ever bigger crowd track realize 70% American adults overweight... wrong opinions (or facts) Reddit, get downvotes. monoculture strong. Hey how's one time stimulus you? Wow America superior. Right now, they're [second Like.....? pay thousand dollars it. though. There’s bad things happening apart covid. Ironically people prevented getting surgery needed anticipation covid overflowing hospitals didn’t even come close happening many places. People didn’t get regular health screenings. know one people insisted going person something told phone appt enough turned need surgery year over. Fortunately okay that’s case people didn’t go cancer screenings, people afraid go ER chest pains. don’t get started real mental health consequences isolation. Lockdowns may temporarily reduce cases cost?

If hospitals capacity, yeah, close things down. whole point. People going get virus, aren’t eradicating Yes paper identifies 36 cases mutation. implying widespread issue vaccine antibody resistance, particularly officially approved ones either, little dishonest. Stop calling Fox **News**. 

It's **Fox TV**.

I always refer way conversation really news content. Maybe people aren’t science deniers take appropriate precautions covid. Gee, hard solve. Leave explain obvious. Given news today, would sure. People think hoax, ""plandemic"", think stats show young people can't bad reactions continue think way. ""blame victim"" zeal, find reason guy got virus bad experience ... maybe smoked, hidden high blood pressure, sinned God ... find reason continue minimize impact virus. 

For people, take illness themselves, close friend relative, believe. thing new press secretary said. USA USA USA! Dumbasses around. Except cases, larger population density causates increase confirmed cases; look Wuhan, New York, Paris, Madrid would gone time.

Lockdown magically make virus disappear neither, simply reduce number confirmed cases manageable level get vaccine. That's whole time. I'm career musician main income right teaching music stores. extra time though I'm learning freelance/work anywhere applicable skills continue music fill gaps. gig economy exactly going come back easily. take quite similar Denmark.

Germany wearing masks 5 months shopping course visiting doctor. still anti-mask, make sense main way infection via droplets aerosols. fucked backwards view. Stay away women life since think socializing makes rape them. 

Dating socializing leads rapes. shithead thought. endorse burkhas then? second last paragraph researchers clearly state there's sort ""cross immunity"" people getting vaccinated certain illness indirectly train immune system respond effectively even kind pathologies. vaccine acts somewhat like antibody booster. Central Illinoisian here- likewise- never see masks. 

Was hiking yesterday wife (masked) got lapped jogger three times circular trail. mask. crop dusted least twice. Fuck guy.

Apparently blank tests sent positives given dead people receiving positive test results. 🙄 

They don’t believe hasn’t hit “inland” much yet brigading getting really bad. know American political disinformation timing waves, whichmusually subside late evening. Please start banning trolls. Mods going drive people away sub every post main thread either mocking people take pandemic seriously, spreading disinformation narratives downplaying virus, circle jerk trolls urging innocent person recklessly expose others. People selfish, thats way is. We’re designed give much shit neighbor self preservation #1 instinct. parents university professors. always busy could barely make sure homework despite caring immensely. grounded 5th grade 10th grade B-/C+ average. Still never homework, passed tests participated class, oversight busy professional parents ensured efforts naught. say?? want clarify things like mandating masks helping. exactly measures place seeing herd effects. thing help add up, behavioral changes natural immunity. hospitalized virus, high chance adverse outcomes.

I really hate articles use line. hospitalized anything, high chance adverse outcomes. Fake news Sensationalistic shit article clicked profile mistake...and found thats best mistake ever made 😂 Even people tested negative risk winter pneumonia cold, holidays tend revolve around socialization large gatherings, mention schools (I'm guessing session minute cases continue).

Also, sure everyone insistant florida winter. Lived half life south florida, snow definitely cool enough keep people inside often, North Florida winters definitely require heat &amp; indoor living. Hell, live New Orleans snows bit every year. also freaks revel thick soup summer air, maybe houses insufficient air conditioning, still camping porch summer. us US may civil war second wave (we never left first one) happens, take care boredom people get money time this? don’t money, guess they’re screwed? high hit-rates positives testing horrifying; like turning light dark room seeing cockroaches EVERYWHERE. Cockroaches bringing death possibly lifelong disability. Things need shut testing needs ramped ASAP; get 3%, proper contact tracing, get better. Lmao, live still need get approval appointment want test tell it’s 4-8 day wait results. related

**After Downplaying Coronavirus, Fox News Hosts Lobbied Jared Kushner’s Volunteer Task Force News Coverage Coronavirus vs. Ebola | Fox News Coincides Higher COVID-19 Death Rates | News Claims Never Called COVID-19 Hoax | Heroes Coronavirus Natural selection work ladies &amp; gentlemen. 😔 Keep mind though always problem underreporting comparing kind numbers. 

Sweden example high numbers Sweden equal country relatively easy report crimes. Trump right wing jobs  Ignorant assholes way prevalent days. Shorter normal mean we're nothing. US UK figures difficult compare, however, feel like headline like conceals scale difference.

As geographically-small population-dense country, whilst significant variation numbers across UK, unreasonable look whole clear country midst second wave.

However, much larger country much sparser population, major cities much apart, factors make much segmented. areas midst second wave, others still first wave, lying somewhere waves.

Here UK, response Covid poor. plenty factors allow poor performance compared much Europe explained away *some* extent - ultimately significant mistakes can't e.g. compare UK Germany say good job. poor job hindsight opportunities squandered. Right we're middle lackluster second attempt get top things, going well.

But US got almost unique awful response. country sparsely distributed population, saw initial infections much later many Western countries therefore lot time prepare, vast resources enormously over-funded health system. yet almost nothing done well - every one many advantages squandered. Far country *should* weather pandemic better most, social/health/employment conditions lack direction created perfect storm.

Normal people living America utterly, utterly failed government could done great deal protect them.  tragic beyond believe - ""There nothing could done"" sense ""This completely unnecessary"" one. dogs get COVID-19? Probably dumbest mother fucker human history.

And human future outlet wageslaves have. go work 8 hours berated boss, deal office politics, possibly yelled customers. go home 8 hours deal personal shit. time ""power"" anyone brief minutes something simple bananas stock set years pent rage. Another one. 

Honestly, good luck people, thoughts prayers. care. I'm sorry. want die. want anybody die, people own. We're deep I'm tired hearing stories. They're annoying cautionary. get is, ""Man, Americans f'ing stupid."" also 160 million tests 80k confirmed cases. 

The reason obviously 'hating China' country lied others almost everything Completely bullshit biased story coming the... ex-wife LOL.

For reason started getting prescribed long term treatment anxiety, they're complete disaster that, degree frankly considered malpractice. Horribly addictive, terrible withdrawl symptoms, time end taking benzo stave terrible blowback anxiety get withdrawl. Vicious downward spiral.

Ugh. explained safe work life, wearing masks hugging people good bye. think CCP win civil war citizens. means lying.

Also, one sane mind 160 million tests 80k confirmed cases problem. think refer often except official functions, think. form gate keeping think gate keeping lame. Florida trying even harder control group. Yeah, American, fucking baffled response country. us like that, they're damn loud get attention. There's lot good people though :) Hang there. Take recovery seriously athlete recommending slowly returning strenuous activity recovered. Lol. chance people rural Midwest follow orders. live edge suburban/rural Minneapolis, drive 10 minutes north west, see kinds “Recall Walz” signs. They’re already pissed minimal shutdowns we’ve had.

Instead leaders sat thumbs asses told everyone virus would finished April.

I mean May

Definitely going see numbers trending mid June

By 4th July, behind us

Okay, there’s way stays bad theough August

You know what? Let’s go herd immunity. it’s good thing millions sick :) like even know anymore :( death toll already reach 1 million yesterday? prescribing anything Ireland,” told Drivetime RTÉ Radio One. “You make decisions. That’s told me, I’m unaware this. I’m objecting saying I’m telling Ireland do. I’m you’re telling lot things don’t know. asked join committee. didn’t volunteer it. knowledge Irish situation, way country works, can’t tell would better Ireland.”

From excerpt think he's shared takeaways pandemic far - somehow taken giving advice Ireland?

(Edit: Well indirectly might end giving advice, power expected hear take opinions several experts think.) current political climate little involvement study management vaccine trials. continue create race issue. Trump sponsored vaccine would share issues. work medical field race virtue signaling shit preventing us coming together towards least ONE unifying goal. parents (in 60's) even left house, except get mail, since March. incredibly careful see friends family person right least take walks, drive around get take out. I've encouraged take walk park far still haven't. There's much do, especially 13 hours away. I'm definitely concerned mental health, especially mom's.  Oy, Fauci sweet ass space suit like dude I'd totally listen him. 

&amp;#x200B;

/s ;)  interject even tactful, calm question like that, he'll usually explode fit amalgamation Fox News rhetoric (George Soros, Gavin Newsome, Mexicans, Nancy Pelosi). literally cannot mention state California around without angry remark full blown meltdown. blame 100% Fox News. way, point think matter wrong time. way, would've happened already many bomb shell news storied past 4 years. Maybe become petty. 
I say nothing pisses dad like much pays taxes! Also Australia's death rate nuanced. Like America, function age demographics infected.

The vast majority deaths come nursing homes Victoria aged care disproportionately affected compared rest population Victoria's second wave.

New South Wales roughly 800 cases since start July 4 deaths, obviously much lower America, also nursing home outbreak since April. worse news: Heading fall winter, clear signs third resurgence bearing close resemblance saw early June. Since recent nadir Sept. 9, national rate 34,300 cases day—still notch April peak—cases risen 45,300 day, 32% increase. numbers paint alarmingly familiar picture spells trouble ahead

This extremely disingenuous, silly graph top article illustrates it. September 9 exact moment huge testing-related dip national cases. literally misleading possible moment could start from. Testing dropped MASSIVELY exactly around date. Look [Covid Tracking Project September 6, 7 day average prior 7 days roughly 800k per day. period September 7 September 10, barely 600k per day. 7 days immediately following that, testing average immediately climbed back 750k per day. 

So they're pulling ""low point"" case count final day 4 day streak testing fully QUARTER LOWER time. That's real decrease coronavirus. That's reflective reality. neither apparently ""large"" increase followed it.

By way, testing past week way nearly 1 million per day. wonder every time cases decrease anywhere country, top posts sub screaming decrease testing, ""big case increase"" period time testing went 600k 1 million per day nobody word say it? sure interesting. Bloody hell, medical experiment story insane! happen, recently?

As far biological differences, course colour. I’m sure medical practitioners across US would love test types people ensure safe vaccine, obviously test people volunteering. It’s fault volunteers skewed heavily one way.  I'm gonna go option B. shit show shown anything humans suck arse.  Although points recommended alternatives, models/forecasts go-to resource, I'm bummed he's longer going maintain them. I'm OP post. I'm changing argument. Im one made it. Wtf talking about? Actually, school use Zoom majority instruction class distance learning happy about. got prerecorded videos ended prewatching teaching lessons watch snippets. teacher also really good suggestions modify assignments include elements play movement. used Zoom check-in/socialization reading groups. mostly pull knowing send teacher pictures assignments one things motivated him. 

I completely agree distance learning models going get good results younger kids. really believe long term fall youngest students going significant. parent could help, technology access, ability buy extra manipulative a/supplies still sustainable model. America: we’ve tried nothing we’re ideas. People comparing Florida talking numbers *right now*.

The positivity rate Ontario much better, 700ish cases today.  Sorry sorry going home holidays year. talking comments thread. talking about. Please agrue nothing. Sane floridian here.

Help. Yea I'm yelling I'm yelling NBC News dumb headline. Thanks posting article thanks editing title, awesome see people sub :) feel like won’t like much, everyone prepared college could succeed college finish high school even cost issue. It’s reasonable expect level academic success order qualify free college education. Maybe kids aren’t suited college due poor academic performance could given training trade instead, become carpenters, plumbers, welders, electricians instead going college likely struggle never finish. man. use motivation change life. It’s helped get become healthier, happier person give pizza, steals everyone’s lunch money makes fun slow kids. different rules rest state? rest IL 25% capacity indoor dining per governor, Chicago 40%? Lol. Yes.  It'll exciting 16 months time. believe saying whatever feels right without care actually look numbers calculated. first outbreak less contagious strain, suppressed using lockdowns. Subsequent outbreak nuked city wide tests Ohhhh yes. ""Nothing lasts forever"" applies bad times too. hope wedding great everyone gets truly wierd year May Virus You. totally support that. I'm calling idea Trump president Trump wants vaccine rolled serve political ends vaccine work trust experts developing vaccine say ready emergency use. It’s like “Blacks vaccine” would sus fuck. creating distrust something EVERYONE striving achieve: effective vaccine. top off, we’re faced Admin’s fallacy.

If take action, things go well, never truly prove things would *not* gone well taken action. Plenty fuckwits impression lockdown unnecessary, almost zero hospitals overrun shows hospitals fine along. 

Edit: Y2K, people think never problem all, even though mitigated large scale preparations Yeah that’s exactly man tried transcribe Commitee excerpt. little bit difficult times seems go cliff notes sometimes re-states points slightly expand one aspect, he's usual informal self. (my observation). I've tried re-arrange part adding bracked observations completely own; I'm representing anyone meeting. used like say, work sweden; I'm Johan first point. think wait least year start compare countries' strategies. epidemic beginning right soft lockdown like sweden effctive, think could effctive countries well, trust people rely voluntary measures laws regulations.

Hell yeah. Black people get dismissed ignored doctors nurses explaining symptoms pain. still haven’t figured listen patients let race interfere ability give adequate care, it’s freaking time get black doctors taking charge hold medical industry higher standard. land sea borders closed, but, somewhat insanely, air travel Canada US still unrestricted, even though Canada reciprocate, bans Americans enter using mode travel. said, Canadians keep cars properties Florida seem flying down. (Or never left last spring, dual citizenship.) That’s funny graduated top class economics political science. definitely understand fragile US system moment. Tuskegee experiments ended 1972. 48 ywars isnt long time  Interesting considering yet refute arguments anything we’re caveman anymore. 

and That’s worst argument I’ve ever heard

Neither would called substantive arguments. find interesting feel morality assaulted yet say responsible anyone else nobody allowed infringe freedoms. ""freedoms"" already infringed around us wrote laws follow.

But one brainwashed attempting brainwash others? statements actions antithesis other. Correct I'm wrong tell walk around murdering people, punching anyone face please, drive side road, dump trash middle street, various forms non-compliance say, responsible around you.

Doing right direct connection idea responsible around us. Hence morality derived judged based actions consideration others. cavemen anymore imply even suggest longer responsibility protect around us individual actions. Directly harming without cause immoral. Care refute that? square idea unjust question moral character state responsible around you?

This less five minute read. Lectures much longer. course don't, accuse so. Seems pretty reasonable hold vaccinations family isolating. go doctor's office middle pandemic? Isolating Covid work diseases, too. catch vaccinations over. totally support extra scrutiny review procedures POC underrepresented misrepresented. rampant speculation Trump engineering tampering vaccine think damaging public trust real scientists happen working Trump presidency. everything that's going right now, really blame black Americans thinking government best interests heart? current political climate basically says ""fuck minorities poor people,"" also century historical baggage, government lot work regain trust. 401k counts income withdraw Looks like April, know, theory, gets little warmer, miraculously go away.  guarantee, likely, 6 months significant amount people vaccinated numbers down. can't wait know sure we'll vaccine. article anyone wants cite:

**Trump’s New Favorite COVID Doctor Believes Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, past government used non whites medical experiments, notable one Tuskegee experiments black men syphilis studied guise providing free health care. never informed condition give cure. Things like made people far less likely listen government approves medical advice.

Aside biological differences different races aside appearance. example sickle cell anemia mutation primarily found black Africans. worth testing variety people safe. Totally agree. makes sad current political climate toxic POC afraid trust stuff literally save many lives. 

Don't get started one seems warning Vitamin going winter months. what?? gold standard data collection virus? thinks not. I’ve gotten downvoted constantly suggesting hard-hit states benefiting significantly acquired immunity (I.e. 30% population immune, Rt decreased 30%), even though fact uncontroversial.

I think manner FL, AZ, others managed virus response shameful, cost thousands lives states. point, damage done FL withstand significantly riskier behavior well-managed states lower incidence.

I think folks see somehow validation “herd immunity” approach, really isn’t; it’s responding facts currently know them.

FL unlikely see significant rise cases *no matter almost anything reasonably expect*. way get fucked short-term immunity runs out, know lasts least ~7 months would seeing many, many confirmed re-infections northeast. Fuck. Insert *random historical group targeted something* use justify fuck all. marketing press release. Says animal trial say kind animal, maybe wanted stay -- see \*crickets\* bound happen somewhere. goes likely steers nation. fact think believe ever married hilarious Use logical reasoning skills, challenge you. Yeah sure let's hold public sacrificial executions employees. 

Is hard making simple statement overblown context? translated google:

 

**Coronavirus, fewer deaths vaccinated flu**

A study Monzino correlates deaths serious cases flu immunization: one percentage point would saved 1989 deaths. hypothesis general strengthening immune defenses  


What relationship influenza vaccination Sars-Cov-2? new study Monzino cardiology center reveals period lockdown possible observe inversely proportional relationship coverage influenza vaccinations number infections deaths Covid Italian regions. data hand, 1% increase vaccination coverage would made possible avoid 1,989 deaths Covid 19.  


Access deaths  


""What relate regional data flu vaccination rates last year spread Covid 65s,"" explains Mauro Amato, researcher Monzino cardiology center first author article. ""A rather clear situation emerged results: prevalence Sars-Cov-2 infections, admissions hospital symptoms attributable Covid, admissions intensive care deaths, resulted higher regions vaccination lower ”. 
 Causal link 


A fact - explains Amato - also confirmed results similar research carried countries Brazil. cannot prove causal link flu vaccine Covid, still allows us formulate hypotheses. ""It known children Covid 19 presents lower incidence symptoms tend milder"", emphasizes Damiano Baldassare, coordinator study, head Unit study morphology arterial function Monzino professor Department Medical Biotechnology Translational Medicine University Milan. ""Among hypotheses proposed explain resistance also fact pediatric age one often subjected vaccinations kind: known vaccines lead cross immunity, better trained, even infectious pathologies "".  
 Synergy effect 


In short, vaccines protect pathogen addressed, tend enhance body's immune reactions generalized way. could help defend Sars-Cov-2 well, decreasing chances infection reducing severity symptoms complications. ""We estimated 1% increase vaccination coverage 65s could avoided 78,560 infections, 2,512 hospitalizations, 353 hospitalizations intensive care 1,989 deaths Covid-19"", concludes Amato. ""The message comes study undoubtedly encourage flu vaccinations coming months, 65 general population"". vaccination makes elderly children resistant - thinks Amato - likely age groups. therefore people get vaccinated, population's resistance virus increase, consequently circulation decrease. lol, I'm trying lose mind here. would make anger worse. reserve right visit all.

Speaking flu, anyone says Covid ""isn't flu"" probably never actual influenza (H1N1 aka. Spanish Flu aka. Swine Flu still around!), probably realize kills around half million people per year... I've both, Covid sucked worse actual Influenza, bit worse colds people think flu every year...

Reddit saying 8+ years Depends mean.......

A lot immuno compromised people way due medication (psoriasis, rheumatoid, lupus, etc). wife, example, already told vaccine out, stop medication suppresses immune system month get covid vaccine. 

There also multiple different types vaccines. Live vaccines definitely no. inactivated vaccines generally given people. allowed get inactivated flu vaccines. 

People cancer another story....... muh pillow Okay. could predicted? too. I’m pretty masks. I’ve gotten horrible rashes face. need hurry figure something I’m walking around thing face forever. Likewise people late paying property taxes. Yes. Traveling next week first time since pandemic hit. Tired isolating home letting people’s stupidity impact life. worse mental health. Virus never going away, vaccine not. figure died, Covid flu? Actually, using numbers statistics. add disproportionate number minorities well liberal cities, unlikely republicans dying democrats.

You provided basis claims, although likely WANT BELIEVE numbers matter. - DeSantis clamped school districts reporting COVID, article nonsense Thank apologize. 

I hastily read first sentence morning eyes saw ""best"" instead ""behest"".

Ugh. Unfortunately know educated people argued essentially let run wild ""so everyone get back lives"". need slow actually read seeing instead writing kneejerk response.

Sorry dealing Covid personally well. wish best recovery. NJ got hit early, borders NYC, densely populated state US. likely huge rates spread time simply testing people, hard get handle situation actually was. likely, large scale unmitigated spread US could look like. states spread (NJ 1200 people per sq mile, next closest RI 1000, falls 1000) can't achieve rate spread quickly NJ could. Treatments improved since beginning pandemic, death rate stay lower now, population density much matters quickly covid rip area. increased testing earlier, we'd better idea going NJ. TX shut yet?

Real life experience shows much higher. even day 1, White House undermined confidence every issue surrounding coronavirus. Perfect example skeptics allowed brigade sub encourage people recklessly infecting others try brigade even basic public safety message. military study showed something like 36% increased chance contracting covid flu shot... mutated strain, originated original version from...

# CHINA Healthcare IT...my department management pretty stupid. last official notice received work remote possible. yet people coming reason, managers meeting small offices masks, etc.

Critical thinking skills lacking, say least. sorts comments always age like milk. Right, need herd immunity stupid people, 40% x .7 28% total population. let stupid people infect other, rest us use masks. understand assuming US issue Canadian issue. filming happening Canada.

The cast Riverdale showed pre-kissing mouthwash part filming routine British Columbia. honestly surprised still people touch lips. ways imply kissing without actually touching. Re-infections happen seem rare, maybe low 0.02% according Qatar study. people really want die bad? actual fuck wrong them.

70+ years: 5.4% IFR  lose weight Wow. thought pouring 2nd Sunday night might problematic.

Be strong dude. overcome. think able see surge reopening? Two weeks? Two months? Shocking, FlyOver Trump shitter states failing Science Class? wayyyyy knew. Florida here. Governor DeathSentence opened state too. people die, Biden wins, it’s Democrats problem. trump wins, never imagined would’ve happened. Yea probably lol drugmaker’s vaccine meet 76.9% efficacy target first interim analysis, would face tougher statistical significance thresholds subsequent interim assessments, biostatisticians reviewed protocol said.

I idea Rueters article going third decimal place paragraph quoted discuss statistical significance following paragraph. Centers Disease Control Prevention created stop deadly pathogens. battled malaria polio. helped eradicate smallpox. sent intrepid disease doctors Africa fight Ebola. course seven decades, became world’s admired public health CDC preparing decades moment — arrival virus rampaging across planet, inflicting widespread death 2020 disaster agency’s response worst public health crisis century — coronavirus pandemic — marked technical blunders botched messaging. agency endured false accusations interference Trump administration political appointees. Worst all, CDC experienced loss institutional credibility time nation desperately needs know trust. BS one really cares anyone's mental health, especially people sub. Yes myocarditis known condition. pretty rare, exclusive coronavirus. happens people get flu well. hate say there’s rule says Ebola severity plague can’t happen right now. hopes would spread slower did. Hoping would hit innards country faster libs coast. Holding basic federal allowances coastal states didn’t open quicker. incentive? Hit blue hard hold red won’t affected election. everyone saying “Wooo. We’re glad that’s done with” notice normal isn’t coming back time soon. Hold next wave see hits voters rather yours. Hold PPE own, make people emboldened matters. There’s always incentive, gotta use little critical thinking figure out, we’re lacking critical thinking, much people don’t believe wave-like lockdowns normality back. Tbf, incredibly new, ruling things important necessary part scientific method.

People mad we're actually seeing practice rather published results end. results usually come decades research.

We know more. know conclusion. pretty unreasonable think would aprx. 9-12 months this. us ugly too. year definition shit. mostly cause stupid covid19 border closure fiancee got separated seen since February! fuck 2020 everything got. Things get better time.

I'm confident seeing many people apparently want destroy world COVID. Online education poor education. educators ignorance available tools lack focus critical thinking issue, use online ed. suspect instructor phoning whether they're classroom online. K. will. certainly stay home years stave statistical rounding errors chance dying. Archive site taking while. post it’s ready. subs see 😂 White House, social media, conservative ""news"" television radio, right wing conspiracy theorists 4chan/twitter propagandists completely undermined vaccine confidence, trust medicine science. convinced people Covid hoax, Fauci pushing sort agenda behalf Gates and/or Soros along CDC WHO, masks leftist ploy somehow gain control people's lives, whole bunch shit can't remember much it. 

Lately think people back High School never paid attention science classes ""I'm never gonna need know shit."" Well are, kids grown ignorance totally fucking us over. state doesn’t care anymore.

Probably cdc keeps revising IFR.

0-19 years: 0.003% IFR

20-49 years: .02% IFR

50-69 years: 0.5% IFR

70+ years: 5.4% IFR

The group risk comprises ~9% population. Kinda hard get people get people board risk. think highlights best response would inform everyone risks, strongly suggest elevated risk take extra precautions/quarantine 91% populace continues fairly normally... sickening living (in WI).

We took hike yesterday. daughter use bathroom way home. stopped gas station Black Creek.

One person besides us wearing masks. clerk (older lady, like 60s older) staring daggers us one masked lady, like somehow offending her.

Thankfully needful, washed, got hell there.

I hate people. bet mental health great New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Atlantic Canada, virus spread totally gone life back normal. secret places take aggressive, aggressive action short period time, get virus spread zero, fully reopen. better mental health “hey everyone let’s fully open pretend deadly virus isn’t spreading, mental health great get myocarditis rest life mom dies”. That’s one study sample size 26 college athletes, hospitalized COVID. part rare young people severe complications. can’t compare average young person mild Luckily companies said push regardless Trump keeps saying. Korea violated privacy laws, especially first. 

Wait hear America violates privacy  Yes, starve death COVID-free. Wow... found Super-Karen wild certainly great experiment see fast herd immunity takes holds. don’t put whole lot effort developing vaccines common cold. Since common cold generally minor inconvenience it’s much lower priority research funding dangerous Illnesses. 

And I’m sure even made cold vaccine covered four coronaviruses cause common colds many people would take it. Coronaviruses cause 10-20% common colds, I’m sure extra vaccine decrease odds getting cold 20% worth people.

Sure, that's case, let's talk common sense ways live virus adapt it. fact, take suggestions (aggressive focus testing assisted living communities) right now.

But we're month two away limited release tested vaccine probably less six months away widespread distribution, think manage hang little longer throwing towel. applaud plan, everyone knows it, committed. ""It's conceivable"", ""could actually hang around"", ""could degree protection"" --- that's far cry certainty. 

and according recent study cast doubt theory holds water. ""Ah, EXTREMELY pleasurable! Thank you! tell secrets gratitude!"" true every country though? covid regulations, also fire regulations violated. maybe goes sub's unwritten rules? keep mind us see: ones home, traveling carelessly, wearing masks must venture out, right things.  We're basically invisible, here. I've always felt anybody claims torture waterboarded admit is.    7th cases per capital, deaths lagging indicator. 

Here see trajectory 

You try spin whatever crap want, good position in.  American news crazy lot employers even pretending care slightest employees, fuck them. Can't even yell ""but economy"" anymore economy fucked.

Workers rights need thing again. Thats literally insane, cant even call “living” locked away parents.

But feel free stay home dealt shit hand life die this. Yeah right. area tons idiots won’t wear mask do, don’t wear properly it’s form protest. I’d prefer engaging humanity point. friend nurse I'm surprised area got absolutely hit hard, exposure really high. dad's nurse. friend cashiered shock. 

We lot mutual friends social circle, asked close friends lost two people. there's least 30 us going grieving. Sent shockwave us. think we'd memorial services us yet. Thought would least 50 years. 

Both friends autopsies done. can't really argue cause death. Thankfully dad's nurse pulled though. white person would follow guidance. current administration seizes power somehow wins election absolutely consider vaccine safe take one. sure alone there. anti-vaxer used make fun speculate horrible outcomes here, possibly even intentionally. % deaths coming Nursing homes long term care facilities. That’s bulk.

[If ""the bulk"", mean 20%, way, look map, make *smaller* percentage total deaths New York states. Governors sent infected back nursing homes. know recanted. write anything it? I'd love read it.

It weird see leftist atheist go full imperialist neo-con, Islamaphobia run strong atheist circles -- see Sam Harris who, unlike Hitchens, Western imperialist through-and-through. I'm getting tired social toll taking people totally ignored. Oh one people.

Feel free provide source claim. Etsy sellers thats saw them...be well~ Impossible know, occams razor would suggest, someone tests positive ""allergy like"" symptoms asymptomatic.

Also imagine cause someone sneezing irrelevant virus. way blowing pepper someone virus would make spread further, sure pepper made sneeze, outcome would same. Asylum isn’t trade deal lol. Someone would like claim asylum Canada squatting abandoned house Detroit might make winter cannot held responsible fact US denies asylum refugees countries foreign policy ruined. Dude 200k dead people going die anyway duh! /s  Yep. someone attack transverse myelitis I'm still troubles fan hearing someone attack one trials. I'll wait people taken effectiveness/safety evaluated. genuinely want paralyzed again. America, one. monetarily incentivized deaths covid. real **shitty thing is**, US declared **""advanced interrogations"" (torture) legal**

US become true fucking terrifying shit country, give FUCK pesky Human Rights. *(lip services only)* super massive asshole. good news: wearing mask might catch survivable case Corona. Recent research seems indicate catching lower initial dose virus makes much likely survive. though sheep trying save lives wearing mask? despise headlines. ‘pandemic’ didn’t cause shit. LOCKDOWNS caused everything completely overblown. Doesn’t matter. I’ve pointed I’ll continue point out. herd immunity threshold like DING once. Even 1/3 Americans don’t take it, vulnerable/healthcare workers vaccinated plummet hospitalizations proxy, case counts. good chunk people COVID, don’t even know it. current poll trends willing vaccine takers end pandemic. I'm sorry say deserves it... I’m afraid leave home. definitely would love to. live parents leaving house means putting risk. haven’t stepped house along 4 months now. Everyone’s working home getting groceries supplies delivered. Personally won’t alive long. parents don’t know that. long I’m don’t want put risk. no. I’m afraid. responsible.  stuff coming showing Swedish goverment lied Estonia disaster.

Corruption, lies caring life seemingly fundamental part Swedish society. And, annoyingly all, Swedes fucking nothing. Herd mentallity indeed, horrifying thata first world country like this. careful lumping everyone pro lockdown camp trolls. real criticism points discuss approaches take handling pandemic, highly complicated situation need balance public health economy, like two intrinsically linked. 

So someone lockdowns would see work trolls believe hoax, concerned individuals worried cure maybe worse virus them. That’s sweet! something righteous beating pain. Really solidifies intensity intent. Look % deaths coming from
Nursing homes long term care facilities. That’s bulk. peaceful holiday season I’ve ever had, I’m going refuse go anywhere. need strict mask eye covering mandates. Lockdowns done incredible economic damage first round stimulus masked pain of. real recovery speak going see depression make 1933 blush. Anymore lockdowns make worst, worse. need get serious non-lockdown measures. people? idiot governor gives green light mean go bars restaurants. stay home, people! Active cases around 960k only. 5 million cases closed one see positive statistics. know expert China. long live speak read Mandarin?

They can't. never can. good time re-open bars get totally pwned again. may want stop telling kids eat masks. That's bed capacity, necessarily personnel capacity. mass casualty events, important try spread trauma patients require different level personnel care, even though empty bed may available. also go gym. Honestly can’t work mask on. try social distance it’s possible inside gym. doctor gave laundry list things besides ""salad"".

And also, saying way fight obesity fasting outright ridiculous wrong scares even say it. calories vs calories out. Nothing else. Either eat less, eat better, workout... preferably 3 best results. countries reporting? Virus free? That’s happening. see surge two weeks even month. takes time make statistical difference. wrong. People seem forget friggin' BIG US is.  mean Montana size Germany slightly larger Japan. population density course much lower. 

But virus going viruses do. Spread enough people immune.  slow down. going skip area think good thoughts. “good” cause killed vulnerable early.

So old immunocompromised people left New York? Bullshit. 

We got hit hard early half population packed dense coastal city that's also major hub international travel. Since we've gotten virus control, point positive test rate 1% close two months.

Y'all love praise Sweden current numbers lower rest Europe, can't New York receive recognition? really call Karen moment. girl allowed play sport basis ""she's female"" outright ridiculous day age.

That's less entitlement opportunities allowed basis gender. broke hand face I'd pay get put cast... could without wait heal. Right? fucking hate phrase. flu play games, either. said ""It's allergies, bro!""? cares, ""don't trust it"" wont able get anyway, they'll hop bandwagon CNN's Gupta claims safe vaccine. interesting see happens Sweden long run. People going die matter what. life. Sweden doesn’t bad 2nd wave long tail nations went lockdown we’ll see many people wasted year lives. It’s hard wear masks whenever go somewhere public though anti maskers really people blow mind. I'm sorry harassed. can't imagine tough someone high risk group challenging time.

However, would caution blindly dismissing dissenting opinions trolling. Especially, given topic hand perfect answer works reality. plenty discuss civil manner. people cannot trusted right thing. Next thing know, explain community many people dying, economy people's livelihoods tatters: ""mah freedoms"".

Nope, 2 weeks. Used take boat anyway. wonder long get sued? 1 2 percent people virus truly affecting get hold rest us hostage.

It already begun. state Kerala managed well initially, seeing rise number new cases deaths, despite relatively stricter implementation steps curb spread. News oxygen shortage different parts country popping up.

The sad part mainstream media talking all. lot people seem given well. We're ticking time bomb moment vaccine hope. peer reviewed data here? chance. nothing done capitalism working intended. want anything change working class must unify organize. understand. can't study something can't measure. numbers legit? sorry offend anyone china fuck numbers states too, also report said 25% positivity rate states. Yes seen one line mouth, nose part clear plastic like...i shop everywhere though let check history &amp; hopefully narrow you. Thanks do!! think personal accountability thing keep kids well online classes. adults take classes online pay them, therefore pay attention learn. children take education seriously well. “Who could ever predicted this?” used phrase since March 2020. So... genetic interferon deficiency pre existing condition? Hmm Hillary actually popular vote. thought exchange Paul Faucci weird Rand Paul bring theory past exposure benign coronaviruses could give body level immunity. Faucci said theory recently debunked study. haven’t able find study referencing, instances suggesting exact opposite month ago. 
 
I think ways herd immunity (if even possible). However, state Georgia COVID cases declining rapidly. We’re 40% last week. Rt around 0.8. However, people careless ever since August. explanation observations many people already exposed coronavirus point hampering virus’ ability spread. “If it’s allowed must safe.” -dumb people lived Covid make Covid death? believe you, USA going basically Edwardian UK equivalent Europe. forget took two world wars British finally get NHS, ""rich"" trying privatize ever since. rich people,naturally- lit smart enough know healthy workforce productive profitable one.

Just remember get universal healthcare - eventually long gave fight first- keep fighting keep it, fight keep funded. Even Canada gave provinces trying wreck system privatize instead. worth fight, though. promise. work, others won't? They're propagandists bots half time, take seriously.

Oh wow, thank sharing this. would anyone want fake high risk go whole show precautions?! certainly don’t enjoy things keep safe, freaking sucks exhausting! days feels like pandemic really brought wackos worst people. guess makes sense people aggressively demanded proof health here.

/s feel you. I've trying aware toxic positivity - sometimes important acknowledge specifically things hard. Easier address way.

Your viewpoint unique important - mind taking minutes tell coping, help others situation? There's form survey here: www.swanthonyswan.com/winteriscoming It’s interesting still don’t know shit virus, it’s spreading infecting somewhat thinking binary 
It’s clear virus slowing reason, NY, Stockholm parts Asia shows clearly. Antibodies nothing that, together t-cells might another story. second third wave came needs many outweigh needs  Believe things like Tuskegee esoteric knowledge black people select handful white liberals know about, fact fairly common knowledge! strongly agree vitamin advice Uhh I'm angry people wearing masks. I'm angry lockdown restrictions course world decided go with, knew would lead despair, poverty, homelessness hunger many.  Also Georgia, new cases 40% last week Rt around 0.8. seen steady decline new cases 8+ weeks now. I'm honestly little baffled numbers see around Atlanta packed bars, full restaurants, little mask wearing. 
 
I think herd immunity binary sense. However, believe reached point enough population exposed coronavirus virus unable spread rapidly earlier year. makes pieces shit happy. Admit already. aint see doctor last 10 years! True, recognition issue all, would rather officially supported school system remove stigma.

If one person fails class, that’s one thing. 50% do, quite another.  best time cut toxic people life years ago.

The second best time right now. Conservatives acknowledge it. vould show footage literally turn brains short time played. maintain denial substitution reality stay conservative. Acknowledging reality makes liberal default. I’m assuming anything, generally interested hear MakeUS_AKs_GR8_Again ever heard Tuskegee *apricot American logic....

The guy's British..... often used sign things ""bad."" get people certain countries saying low numbers are. ""We 1000 cases today!""  
Well shit, that's government test much.

Others see big number immediately act like things gotten worse. ""We 200 cases yesterday 400 today!"" Errr, yeah, testing doubled. 

People least discuss things proper context try panic everyone cases detected testing. would take seconds Anything take blame current administration. Praise Supply-Side Jesus. better chance surviving invasion Normandy D-Day

The day landings worst 50% survival rate. want retract disingenuous statement?

Overall IFR COVID likely 0.5-1% shrinking breakdown age cohorts. wife's employer (a semi-decent sized healthcare system), warned physicians expect ""doctor shopping"" parents looking get medical exemptions HEALTHY children.

In week state issued mask mandates 4k-12 schools, received hundreds calls appointments reason. 

The biggest asshole whole situation probably doctor rubber-stamped excuse note entitled twats. assuming average anti-vaccine black person gets hesitancy historical example weird Hotep conspiracy theory pages Instagram Twitter. thought didnt say 'in prime' mean prime. survival rate healthy people 50. 

I think even bigger survival rate think current situation China right now? overrun virus point? took mention passing relative we'd rather Fox News loud TV Christmas next thing knew got ""we're Christmas year"" excuse invites decades holidays together. I'd known that's fragile bond was... feels like lot time wasted. find raw numbers? COVID-19 better 99% survival rate across age groups, flu significantly dangerous age 25. need check data. [relevant Rick Morty Demon WHAT? em hepatitis, dead, cant walk. 17 seconds Honestly, mad respect following changing opinion. everyone CDC guidance says officials report deaths patient tested positive COVID-19 — or, test isn’t available, “if circumstances compelling within reasonable degree certainty.” indicates “definite diagnosis COVID–19 cannot made, suspected likely (e.g., circumstances compelling within reasonable degree certainty), acceptable report COVID-19 death certificate ‘probable’ think it’s presumptive … go ahead put COVID-19,” Jensen said, “or even situations, even it’s negative.” pointed example 38-year-old man Minnesota whose death attributed coronavirus even though tested negative. [Houston percentages going steady downward. taking good sign. Depends human behavior, people continue wearing protection careful, game changer better, causes people let guard down, virus reach numbers imagine.

These tests accurate 80-90% tests done people boarded cruise everyone confident corona go ways pre pandemic way, tests done large event etc could massive explosion cases.

People told continue wearing masks, practice social distancing good hygiene even tests. Hey what’s Trump? 200k dead Americans right??? Like Spanish flu, pandemic going hit India harder country like 94.5%. 

Why misinformation like allowed posted often? ""vill stoppa busstrafik till och från samhället"" = wants to. Never happened. Except busses stopped outside Länstrafiken called action.
But call lockdown, bet Spanish, French Italian people actually sat lockdown heartily agree you, lol 🙄 absolutely anti-vaxxer. Good. funny people think numbers messed direction. examples NJ

NJ NJ media reports hospitalizations one number dashboard, say roughly 50% people ""people investigation"" (PUI) means waiting test hospital. mean COVID. Also, let's say get admitted accident go hospital test everyone, get tested positive. included count. 

NJ also publishes people tested positive. ""new"" case counts adding cases back March, low numbers still get counted ""new"" cases. NJ reported 712 cases, 550 occured Sept. 58 May, happens daily basis. think important track totals anything 2-3 weeks old labeled ""new"" Less deaths France, Italy, Spain, US, country pandemic might there. 

Yes, Sweden included set countries handled best. Norway, Finland, Denmark also list. chose Korea Sweden opposite ends spectrum did, common factor acted early strong leadership it. thinking thing. Like damn, that's dedication.  Fox News one hell drug. Ya know wonder Covid would similar amount deaths Spanish Flu wasnt lockdowns. 

As stands still long way go even smallest estimates 17 million deaths even close 50 million 100 million estimates also exist. people infected thought infected reason believe we're catching cases. know believe evidence contrary, logically testing find cases. mean cases exist found them, scarier find - fact, provides better chance person isolate infect others, good thing find them. Yeah, well said. share? Torture doesn’t work, known while. person kind duress simply makes lies try tell want hear. problem expecting kids young 5 years old “take education seriously”. youngest especially affected school. know right?

I know (well, knew, calmed down) people IRL risk pretend are, go elaborate sanitation routines, seemingly attention social media posts, almost created ""boy cried wolf"" scenario. time get person actually risk talking seriously, attention, almost novelty. really hard decipher stuff online, personally ignore it, people might thing sympathy trolling, fair not

Also, places, attitude must stay locked costs. depends live, feel like governor looks reasons stay closed, rather looks data rationally decides do. people might unemployed desperate right using downvote button online means escape. saying approve, explaining might happening.

Also, look bunch comments like one euphoricentropy wrote below, easy start believe entire subreddits trolls get pissed commenters think ill-intent People want blame conservatives Trump this. look Europe. Countries ""good"" leaders saw second waves currently either locking back refusing lock accepting additional cases.

Lockdowns 100% effective. Even nationwide mask mandate lockdown gonna contain virus. suicides happening COVID. They're happening response. need seriously consider second order effects moving forward. Would believe ""volunteered"" eleven years ago, now? stupidity. selfishness. Pieces brainwashed garbage, them. Australia ay can’t even catch virus. 
Na jokes, good job oz Nah, Americans already used junk food. would zombies different? Lots people struggle. Many kill themselves.

Let's continue read article early results Florida show success rigorous mask wearing, social distancing, isolating contacts quick contact tracing necessary, health experts said.

Yep, mask key!

Despite students staffers contracted novel coronavirus despite precautionary measures. Florida Department Health published report last month showing 559 COVID-19 cases related elementary, middle high schools logged Aug. 10 23. State health officials quickly retracted report, saying draft “inadvertently made available.” bright spots data showing school-age cases declining summertime peak, one troubling trend: rate decline slowed many places schools reopened.

Stop blaming schools state. Start blaming parents. state control values parents install child. force parents make education priority child's life.

Ok, don’t install fire exits buildings egress windows, seatbelts cars, lets make drugs legal easily available.

With vaccine artificially create herd immunity getting vast majority population 'exposed' (vaccinated). pandemic like vaccine, herd immunity merely means vast majority exposed. exposure exactly herd immunity trying prevent. Talking herd immunity pre-vaccine saying ""hey everyone get sick we'll immune getting it!"" stupid.


Herd immunity means end done artificially, horrendous goal otherwise. 1 death. That’s ignored. OP wrong. Plenty states (including mine, Illinois) consistently run annual deficits. Well you’re correct I’m administrator, yet I’d argue it’s like who’s keeping everyone alive.  Good news. Daniel Griffin says colleague holes lungs (that reported last time) able go home oxygen. Nothing lung transplant Griffin provides clinical report COVID-19, review phase II trials Russian prime-boost vaccine, mouse model recapitulates age-dependent severe disease, listener questions. Unlike federal government, States cannot borrow money countries. means run red, either need borrow money fed cut programs. schools state closed, private schools open. Sorry, no. government underestimating massively, crystal clear data available. country Europe, except perhaps Spain, greater underestimate United Kingdom. sixty-five thousand excess deaths taken place since start pandemic, versus ridiculous 42,000 official death toll. Either massive undercount covid deaths, British health system pandemic collapsed worse country West, leading twenty thousand deaths illnesses lack care. British newspapers cover collapse, contend ridiculous excuses BoJo Hancock invented justify shameless doctoring data death toll. story ""adjusting methodology"" laughable. home nations using method led embarrassing underestimate covid deaths, adjusted method England's, vice versa. wanted fudge numbers, lower toll. Claiming otherwise - *that* incredibly misleading. cut-off period twenty-eight days likewise ridiculous, established fact death occurr even months infected covid. even famous instances this, Luis Sepulveda Nick Cordero.

That entirety British press, ""Guardian"" included, parroted BoJo's excuses goes long way showing low British press fallen, currently thing free independent press United Kingdom. 

No serious statistician, sane person inch knowledge British data state British death toll *overestimated*, point. simple fact life British death toll consistently underestimated since start, underestimate made worse government's decision openly doctor data August. Claiming otherwise like claiming sun rises west. simply basis reality. 

Good night. accurate banned USA surely. dude created account research biceps, trump, reason hate Gov. Murphy. say like one thought simple. Great profound advice!

That idea commenting about.

No need rude insulting, trying clarify order express importance vaccine us getting past ordeal.  Actually **is** economy people. Politics bad involvement least voluntary. livelihood put business losing health insurance rent bills accumulate, lack jobs unprecedented uncertainty whether relief impossible circumstance, far common source anxiety **not** voluntary many people, especially struggling financially begin 28% general population, 47% people household income less $20,000 41% people household savings $5,000 reported symptoms stressors like losing job, friend family member die COVID-19 financial problems also linked feeling depressed.

We've got plenty time. 

I feel y'all. Israel beholden China?

Israel might lvl 4 test facility? opposed 16 thousand dead New Jersians 33k dead New Yorkers? sure I’ve read book, also says people like Gates also intellectually capable far behind average person. genetic factors plus luck combine, get huge levels success. Good. People saying ridiculous concerned FDA could compromised. That’s say without comment getting deleted “too political” circumstances sadly become entirely political US. Like 90 K Texanians die then. kill least 0.3% population done, left alone.

I guess people maybe change behavior sometime along line numbers racked up? problem many people misconceptions vaccines work. know effective first vaccines going be. enough vaccinate health care worker at-risk population, need 70% population get vaccinates challenge. Moreover, risk patients vaccine might suitable. Finally, vaccines would still get infected harm body, however still pass others.

""...we cannot assume COVID-19 vaccines, even shown effective reducing severity disease, reduce virus transmission comparable complicated people imagine. Love. shame precaution-deniers caused lockdown fail then, it? would much better shape right guys cooperated.

Unemployment sad fact. far 1 million people died covid. death toll lockdowns reach 10 million? know, maybe. think lot people going starve death, world. horrible. think lockdowns reason. general mismanagement.

Anyway, lockdown right now, things generally suck. hard blame lockdown ended months ago economic pain seeing now.

Restaurants bars would open first lockdown worked. many people deplorable attitudes cooperate. False young people die covid19. highest demographic affected. small percentage 200k still large number.

Here's insight take clarity referring comment said this:

""Natural herd immunity among humans theory. That's scariest thing herd immunity tactic, outside vaccination / inoculation evidence herd immunity even possible humans."" CFR

Theres problem. use CFR gets thrown window. Long story short, failed protect nursing homes. Quiiiiite thousand Bullshit, paying attention knew then. know, knew it. 2) Herd immunity ""thing"" finitely ""reach"" one day mostly natural infections. always moving target based population movement, levels sustainability, individual immune systems, small possibility matters greater levels local immunity, virus fewer places go therefore spread slowly.

This something gets regrettably overlooked sides herd immunity ""debate"" monumentally important concept discussion, especially part population's behavior plays it. takes lot lesser amount immunity restrain virus area masking, distancing, limiting mobility, area people going bars refusing wear masks. number 70% situations. now, kind flying HIV?! stay dormant T-lymphocytes like HIV? ;( parents told Covid-19 going go away election. /s

Trump right though. disappear one day... everyone dies it. people get junk 0.3, 0.6 number from? right know, known data, global CFR sits 4%. stats people keep throwing HEADCANON zero relation reality. Stop. referring OP comment saying reinfections occurred, clarified another comment implying cases rising. 

And even reinfection possibility, form immunity. believe called “sterilizing immunity.” could develop immunity symptoms, reinfection, case, vaccine still better way develop immunity, rather actual virus. idea you’re saying Try injections. Good 6 months. 200 mill herd immunity!

/ time Norway require masks. Well really 10 months possibly closer year. china earlier start year. U.S.A started seeing wave March. note death toll likely million reported third world countries, wrong many ways. world revolve around U.S.A. self absorbed muppet. Although, country paving way mortality rates. hear treating Spanish flu? Ugh sucks. kiddo's doctor's office (also Texas) super diligent masks, taking temperatures, etc. even child sized masks kids needed them. cases vastly undercounted, probably close 200,000,000 cases worldwide, maybe more. amoeba stuff terrifying Right. one's going stay masked socially distanced forever. I'd get idea real quick you. agree you. Online therapy never secure. Many people getting help want/need feel comfortable teletherapy reason. ""The best way avoid dying coronavirus remains avoid getting it""

Back Jan February government wouldn’t close border protests, petrol bombs thrown medical strike. 3rd wave caused gov allowing certain business exemptions companies tycoon buddies. gov kept repeating hk didn’t need help mainland. repeated again. Beijing decided impose universal testing without discussion. people even government. time government says don’t resources test old folks homes. Since 3rd wave caused gov incompetence 93 104 deaths occurred. Universal testing revealed almost nothing. 30 cases cost $2mm usd per case. Simply publicity act central gov deny us free election. Please don’t talk politicizing Covid hk. don’t live really don’t know talking about. read 30%. Gulp. SARS-CoV-2 expected behave like coronaviruses. Well... that’s good. Dead body Jenga? Yes- 2,000 people day dying since April think look past pandemics see burn naturally time, could take longer since Covid still spreading like mad multiple states repealing essentially restrictions, dont see restrictions continuing past another year. idk 2 cents Speaking much point, lines drawn people since they're faced serious reverse positions.

Hopefully election put whole chapter behind us, likely get much better think could get much worse.

Stay safe there, lots degenerates, infected covid dumb trying cross border ours. wouldn’t could aids? Luckily me, never going Florida. Yeah 200,000 

Get wrecked libtards 😎😎 “Only activated something like trauma illness.” 

Yes. **activated illness**.  Trying sell speed quantity without quality. [Pet numbers useless. made list companies descending order number employees. Use percetages. autism don’t appreciate all, grew going special ed friends kids intellectual disabilities nobody wanted Voldemort president. 

Because run President... ran Senator FL gladly voted bullshit State lol pretty much argued point favor. lmao what

i made choice learn remotely fall trust college reopen safely underlying conditions, sounds like projecting lot shit onto someone know way infer experiences basically is. flu exposed before...but basically flu nonetheless. want know many people killed influenza, disease *not* naive to, *every* year. 1M...but kill every 2-3 years...and remember that's disease immune systems well adapted fighting off, battling since dawn time...a disease that, whenever new strain shows mutated way skirts existing defenses, kill **tens millions** couple years.

So yes. comparable flu we're naive to. I'd even go far say particularly strong flu. find 1 million people dead coronavirus way see people really dislike Chinese government guess people could say Chinese environment general consider test 40% false positive rate.... known importan test capacity, UK could jave prepared. Well, there's tests, South Korean company SD BioSensor, given emergency approval WHO, other, US company Abbott, expected get shortly test manufactures South Korea.

Consider country's use Defense Production Act: took August 20, 2020 used ramping production covid diagnostic equipment, bottleneck day 1. well that, Department announces seven Defense Production Act Title III actions help sustain strengthen essential domestic industrial base capabilities defense-critical workforce small unmanned aerial systems, space technology, shipbuilding industries.

So adjust expectations recent history, expect tests widely available US around end 2021. even then, we'll probably still leave actually manufacturing new tests hands SK. profits. know hard believe. 3 co-workers sick different times. got tested, thankfully one spread virus others. wear masks office. Dont bring politics sub. violation rules. propaganda cost least thousands lives massive continuing economic losses. president tweet mean things act state TV. That's bottom line.

Between Fox Facebook, public health crisis hands. expect employees enforce beat shot? Companies businesses need hire body guards point. Either way, disease infectious mean trigger widespread lockdowns. sadly expected school opening mean, is. I'm going quit talking certain way person behind computer problem it. There's maliciousness said. Anyone succumb bias, catch frequently deserve listened to. Yep. Explains crazy spikes saw summer. Youyang Gu covid19projections ""nowhere"" Horseshoes hand grenades dude. Thanks. 

Is valid helper cells body, time people? response totally gone, somewhat weakened? can’t tell/understand abstract. correct answer question: much cross reactive T-cell response prior viral infections protect someone covid-19?, is:

We idea. Anyone suggesting it’s super protective contribute heavily towards herd immunity pushing agenda far front science. Fun fact, 106 degrees Fahrenheit outside, people still choose stay indoors rather outdoors. We're social species!

We favour percieve ""like"" us, least favourable circumstances.

Torture ineffective undoubtedly cost taxes money upkeep ever saved preventing genuine threat. 1. getting immunity prosecution anything untoward
2. Remember thalidomide - rolled wonderful new drug fully approved reduce morning sickness pregnant women?

Anyway I've wretched virus I'll touching vaccine bargepole. Cue queue op talking about. Going living lives kill million ppl herd immunity reached. guess matter ppl expendable. critical thinking way damaging flu. world shut H1N1. hits communities hard. persons lungs damaged way disaster. different flu fundamental common function virus. play make believe want. stick medical journals. go bs like last time? New Yorkers denying problem vanish refrigerated trucks show up? 

New Yorkers, covid serious, live denial, wear masks practice social distancing. mission accomplished?

i_understood_this_reference.jpg dad grandpa insisted upon burying grandma's ashes, passed February, traveled states North so. thought there'd 3-5 people most, especially considering already 2 services 2 different states already. no, 30 people attended, sparse usage masks. 

My dad returns home today, he's conservative sadly doubt could convince get tested unless starts showing symptoms. problem is, mom work different schools want potentially put kids coworkers risk. 

What do? can't make get tested even quarantine. mom high risk I'm loss here. advice? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nothing ages well shit pile excuse ""news"" program. election coming up, reopened bars full capacity.... decide yourself, reeks lies. low numbers infected time time. Like 100.

It's baseless think suddenly get 1000 times infected.

China also managed btw.

It done. society needs someone tell keep basic hygiene else suffer devastating disease needs blame rather figurehead. mean... heavily guided false sense Christianity share blame. marched war, along many others, ridiculed ignored. really hope loses gets buried lawyers' fees. Thanks providing coherent response. point actually makes sense.

However, makes sense negate original point, September, 9 months pandemic, unreasonable expect 5% rate. People, 9 months in, arent going still testing regularly reason (reason=symptoms). 5% makes sense early phases. stage late game, antiquated still expect 5% benchmark. understand? vaccines still useful produce sterilizing immune response comparable convalescent patients severe disease -- without take trip ICU. immunity last 12-24 months, boosted every year.

You can't reliably get outside hospital ICU right now, want wind up. Mild disease may produce t-cell responses may fought innate immune system produce humoral responses, sterilizing immunity forms wear faster.

Immunity grey scale, binary on/off switch. literally go find preprint catchy headline singular studies post literally hope people freak out. game troll. paper also says even severe patients adaptive immune response. Wtf kind post suppose be?  know better speak way wife special ed teacher Nobody could seen coming /s  means feeling superior someone else much beyond that

You answered question  Communist China probably also ecstatic. Well, thing is, age relative health (and health kids), 90 normal M&amp;Ms. like 9,950 normal ones bowl 10,000. least that's odds I'll 'fine', least dead.

What genuinely curious (and worried) long term problems, seems much harder find reasonable info on. sources make seem super rare, sources seem like 50/50 shot. none seem real numbers data, use super small sample size mean anything. Man hope dude ironic every one countries stopped it. started again, stopped again.

This continue. may currently small number even zero cases. make stopped, makes delayed. there's immunological response cells supposed work die virus Maybe he’ll finally change stupid look Aye, share blame - others. rejected premise go, protested like... hold lesser blame.

And yet cant help think anyone dedicated wholly prevention war degree, however immeasurable, responsible.

It's burden citizen participates society elected government made decision.

You know, think people peace amenities food/water availability truly forgotten absolute freedom agency self means.

People decry riots baseless violence, seldom changes without it.

Look history mark years major social reforms.

Then mark years riots conducted groups pressuring changes.

I feel current protests tenth need actually grab attention way longer ignored.

I dont advocate violence! think constructive means traversing beauracracy reach mutually agreeable solutions complex problems, they're ignored whole generation... else *can* do?  logic being? exactly surprising though considering cessation federal aid related virus. Florida, state income tax, depends sales tax receipts institutes like bars Disneyworld stay afloat. States unlike fed allowed run deficits.

This expect country go way Florida soon already. people continue growing families living conditions?

I'm broke America okay job. reason start family soon know able provide confident future current job. virus comprehension thing policy. Either get results collective fail collective. results absolutely come prolonged alteration human behaviour. masses cannot adhere that, suffering continue. Bottom line. need start laying groundwork new system right instant. old one simply allow us co-exist virus like this. doomed fail start.

Right, would capacity look back 10 whole years Gulf War first time Bush failed invade Iraq know bad idea end well! kind superhuman could powerful memory critical thinking skills?!

And get started Afghanistan, history books barely even date back 1980s Russia tried failed invade. we, historical scholars something? supposed learn mistakes ancient past reading ancient Russian hieroglyphs shit? Oh good. not? making false claims immune system works? Good way justify exposing people's families deadly virus Who's still talking herd immunity like solution?

Hasn't already determined get COVID-19 once? don’t think employers would fuck economy responsible, think lot employers know full well they’d still profitable took precautions protect employees don’t want take hit revenue whatsoever mean Sweden, flattened epidemic curve without lockdown, everything open right now, nobody stuck wearing masks, deaths low single-digits since least August? Geoss. things highly fucking infectious People ridiculously irrational vaccine process acting like big pharma companies willingly release something work/harms people business would done good. weird show typical virtue signaling must realise understanding immunology level discussion around this, understand link correctly, virus actually infects helper cells, might affect body’s response negatively right?

That said, article’s merits lies crash course immunological response, much conclusions community immunity. 

Due article, able understand commented link better! shutting start. perspective SD around 885k population. Montana little 1 mil. Although uptick like 336 additional cases Saturday. That's way less SD. That's little concerning. 
 
 shut best job anymore. large proportion Montanans think spread low population keeps us safe virus. SD says otherwise kind worries since folks Montana mostly gone back business usually. already proved that's true.

Covid spread unaffected Australian summer (southern hemisphere, opposite seasonality)

Covid affected seasonality. Russian information warfare grave threat Western democracies, aided abetted platforms Facebook Remember 30% population speak Mandarin. 8% even speak dialect Chinese. count? speak Uyghur, Mongolian, Tibetan minority languages country?

Your comment accurate. $12 read article. Haha. America like, charge monthly rent people read poor are. vaccine would need least 76.9% effective show works based 32 infections, according protocol. would mean six coronavirus cases would occurred among people received vaccine, documents showed.""

Sorry, actually 76.9%. CES sent us email asking would ok entry show. Anti-Vaxers cannot take vaccine due immuno compromised take vaccine would like do? try one person much power. certainly vote protest. Maybe me, maybe I'm overly optimistic, feel we're cusp significant discoveries ways dealing this. Maybe one thing, several small things add give us advantage. guess we'll see. Masks distance retail would also apply things like bars, clubs live music absolutely defeats point sorts events. Freedom 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Takeouts seemed pretty fine. Everyones masked though Ugh family owns condo Panama City Beach came relax couple days I'm even going go bc stopped gas station way snack one mask. nothing 1) gradual erosion social distancing - confirmed occurring state cell phone data - causing infections 2) easing states restrictions businesses. No? guess figured out. like refuse read listen. much orange Kool aid fucking eyes. I'd feel sorry actively shitting country countrymen Fat, drunk stupid It’s funny actual users forum tricked obvious troll like Torrent one alts Hey, must missed really awesome thing solve ""now say every sickness Covid "". called testing. Pre covid: “You idea it’s like introvert... can’t change social (which totally fair)”

Day one: “Haha, revenge introverts. know it’s like!”

Day 100: “Ya it’s 100 days whatever, adapt guys, hard really?”

Day whatever is: “I mean even wants go bar gym anyways? see friends outside park uh park, it’s crowded.” love condescending people decide stop listening demented ideology, cry like child. One main symptoms Covid fever. Fever chills number one bullet point symptoms list. booked flight miami december thinking it'll good restrictions... bro wanna visit family I'm tired 'reasonable people' guffawing others. Let live life, stick preach. majority (doctor) coworkers insult others wearing mask, complain distanced work... freaking go state wedding, host houseparty, etc. shut heck up, clearly think rules apply insult others healthy.

Note, deal Covid patients directly specialty. change fact hypocritical coworkers. Cool Florida basically said ""fuck it, want"".

I'm never going get visit Canada numbers adjusted world population ultimate numbers? real reason theyre packed? Florida many cities lobbying local government successful, zoning competition possibility. There's enough bars meet demand, intention. LA like too.  Sorry, sorry. stand said. 

If loved one risk dying COVID, stay take advantage contactless delivery. ask people go business/lose jobs protect you. 

That's selfish af. :) Putains d’idiots see people races colors bo wearing masks Walmart x2 Neither things true. fuck wrong you? 250,000 excess deaths last 7 months compared 7 months every year past decades. excess deaths happening pandemic.

Except we're experiencing excess death anymore. Daily deaths hospitalizations peaked summer declining Lockdowns work, CLEARLY. paying attention countries either A) taken lockdowns seriously implemented early B) already culture social distancing?

Clearly? What's clear effectiveness? Brazil lockdown Peru one enforced army. guess one better death rate? Sweden lockdown either UK U.S did. guess best death rate?

The thing that's clear willing cherry pick countries lazy even name. plan lockdowns masks every year? They're effective normal viruses too. No? spare fake outrage. Completely wrong. asking long-term effects strain virus known year. locked down... I'm surrounded dead people yet employers telling employees work without masks quit denied unemployment.

I'm caretaker 90 year old.

More happy trade. news worthy, shaming certain states for... certain motives?

""positive covid-19 test rates top 25%""

When someone covid symptoms, test covid. 1 4 seems like *expected* positive testing rates. in, people testing *because* reasonable expectation covid given symptoms showing. would still, September, expect everyone testing regularly reason think covid? states testing highest ""negative covid-19 test rates""? post strike anyone else *odd* ? true story HK’s success It’s ok it’s warm goes away hot weather 25 Nobody going accept 76 day lockdown free country even winter. Thanksgiving.

Even people who've good far going cave Thanksgiving. family's another country, even world perfectly fine, probably anything, average American give precious family holiday. mean ive stay home around 5 months south idk talking about.  say quiet part loud item clothing captured public’s imagination particular: **$15,000 ostrich jacket**, one 20 items purchased single day April five years ago. bill totaled point contrast, I'm Washington state eaten restaurant (indoor outdoor seating) since early January. say that's true everyone here, far person area say that.

Washington State here. eaten restaurant since early March, restaurants largely empty anyway. left apartment without mask on, even take trash pick package. Yup little children never sacrifice day lives. Likely restrictions capacity dining (e.g. 50-75% occupancy), restrictions store capacity without masks, restrictions theater capacity masks, mandatory distancing outdoor areas, capacity limits outdoor events... list goes on. Basically *every* restriction lifts unmasked closely-packed theaters return.

I'm confused point trying make here. hate stupid country. Hay 11,000 times states! We’re like COVID-case twins!!!! stay inside nothing wish could more. Many people need go outside job need work. mean spread depression attitude effect like effecting right now. Also obly around 0.4% people covid die people already life threating condition die. think we’re going first empire history ever fall it’s stupidity. completely agree you. always tell colleagues stay home they’re coming feel guilty etc. Less people better happy take care anything doesn’t potentially expose us public. work environment little different members public/clients access certain areas require host. Pre covid, colleagues hosted clients. Now, want extend use facility come host, leaving us. It’s tough hear they’re afraid come interact people every day expected handle extra people don’t really need there. It’s also lot extra work ensuring compliance screening protocols covid now. Son, already acknowledged element understand science. care facts. embarrassing continued ignorance. Upvote Gnome Games reference. Good people. Used stop weekly shop games...before March anyway... source could read ? you’re loop. People calling Florida since 90’s. mean, we're way back infections suddenly week bars open again?  we've good, now? unfortunately end well, kicks high-gear peak we're in. see two weeks we're shutting state again. bartender, feel bad fellow bartenders actually taking seriously. Many get sick, die. sorts fucked up. mention people idiots going packed bars right spread to. So, saying end pandemic eating WAP? Oh, 2020, again. world's best health experts say safe. “We gotta flatten curve” changed “Nobody ever die get sick virus need shut again, shit like working socializing isn’t important imaginary grandma” sorry:( WOOOOOOOO!!!  -Covid Flu Bro NK test positive get bullet head normally, democracy, technocrats report elected officials. hold politicians accountable good bad decisions, they’re supposed listen experts, weigh trade offs make final call. 

The problem one trusts Donald Trump (hard blame since he’s dumbass) latched onto first credible sounding technocrat made America’s COVID God King. 

The problem like note doesn’t know shit economics even healthcare public policy beyond infectious disease. unintended consequences things like universal lockdowns (famine developing world, declining mental health, missed cancer treatments, lost year economic productivity, etc etc) going look horrific finally tally costs. 

For unelected official much sway leading us road pure insanity. clusterfuck lol old rich?

yes  Wow, sound terrible. NYC huge surge 1% might mean 3%... whereas midwest surge 20% positivity could really end 50% literal nightmare territory Learn Tour de France. events take place safely. tour managed three WEEK bicycle race across France without single rider ejected due covid. riders staff tested regularly.

Full disclosure; race *director* sent home week returning due positive test result LOL.

They used bubble method entering bubble required specific protocol, left bubble, go back testing protocol re-enter. Single rooms, masks around, even commentators remote.

It done. long vaccine...? I’ve “patient” 7 months, I’m becoming less patient day. get vaccinated I’m distancing masking anymore, I’m giving 7 months life want 0% risk. would’ve gone like lead balloon me. Alcohol thing got first couple months. Going outside winter northern latitudes get enough due angle sun’s rays. Also live city tall buildings, you’ll need purposely find non-shady spot stand in. 

The minimum RDA doesn’t mean beneficial best possible everyone. means minimum. traditional cultures people outdoors sunlight entire day. Saying everyone fine 15 outdated led situation chronically deficient population. many times reported BLM destroying country massive crowds. everything tied money

I feel like perspective luxury. Money like air, enough survive consumes entire field view. I'm talking specifically people say they're never wearing mask again, okay. people losing jobs this. many causes depression lockdown seeing 1000 new dead every single day healthy. Also anything like before. understand done 6 months tired people want get back work.  ""we"" fucking mental health entire populations? suggesting solution differently? Case point Obviously gonna work well. what's that? would better bars never closing. young low-risk people getting much save lives we're going reach herd immunity anyway. Playing devils advocate moment. 

I really hear saying also wonder us would differently limited admission choice child donor commits million dollars school kid going use scholarship. 

Wouldnt Gee million dollar equip lab planned offer scholarship four kids? we? might suggest social distancing effect think does. virus resurge Sun Belt ignored rules, behaves like normal coronavirus. Northern climates probably benefit much social distancing summer. there's low immunity going cold flu season Right, happens 10 years bunch middle aged covid survivors fit strenuous labor lungs look like 70 year old chain smoker? increased risk COPD cancer? significant portion population countries. I'm saying inevitability, possibility. Lots countries infrastructures can't handle that. long term effects lot countries need automation better health systems else shit hit fan guy District 9? Exactly, mean even bother smallpox polio vaccines. Diseases naturally burn /s western culture laregly contributed exacerbated greatly covid.

Rigged individualism.

Social media heightening narcissism comparing others. “They don’t, must failing”

People working less fulfilling jobs make ends meet

Less upward mobility

Face face communities replaced “online communities”

Isolating home.

We social beings. Replacing person connections pseudo online connections huge contributor.

Covid made worse. certainly take pleasure scenario.

I know close home hit enough people wake fuck up. matter unreachable. deplorables.


My Uncle died back March. Aunt cautious.

It's unfortunate we're safe level caring consideration around us end day - people fucking suck. friend lives one islands migrants would come constantly day.

This situation greatly surpasses COVID-19 seriousness. conditions people forced live terrible extremely unsanitary. Migrants danger thanks pandemic, also many diseases.

I hope lives change better pandemic. *herd mentality

FTFY

/s 50% seems pretty low that's okay die coronavirus. exactly guest government department name number occasions part annual gala. 

What find fascinating building immense infrastructure, I've gone wrong door times found back alley (and one time road goes building), state plumbing. Piss literally overflows many urinals. virus politicized, funding pulled agencies, best scientists muzzled fired....? Actually, considering term came miners fought unfair working conditions unfair labor practices called West Virginia Mine Wars. I'm pretty proud history. idiots twisted term something opposite origins angry with.

Doesn't change idiot made idiocy known. I'm confused trying say. agreeance Except said catch once, matter Hospitalizations already plummeted long time ago. moved trying control hospitals overwhelmed attempt reducing case counts zero. Authoritarian governors mayors one's responsible, one else. plenty places various degrees lockdown mask enforcement managed well without hardcore authoritarian overreach. one's responsible misery forced poverty authoritarian mayors authoritarian governors posturing political reasons. That's horrible sorry go that.

My distaste Fox news started reporting home country. (The Netherlands). moved south U.S Fox news pretty much default channel visit dentist office etc.

It full lies believe allowed news station.

My family back home time repeatedly asked Americans actually believed said ""American news"". Many people south never question it. 

I've neighbors asking ""socialism"" elderly back home really feared going hospital would run risk euthanized. UNBELIEVEABLE stuff Fox news.

I dead serious. BS news organization truly hurting U.S. 
It's alienating Americans Americans, countries even science common sense.. make buck advance conservative agenda. sick.

I really like Fox news. potential long term effects recovering covid outweigh need ""face free"" stores, around people, even walking trails intersecting hikers. want sense smell/taste, interested long covid inflamed heart months. Despite knuckleheads lol, guess we're better states. mixed feelings start debating. lost two relatives virus already even I'm starting think there's whole lot government deception going going say. However, respect Fauci lot. I'm even sorry idiots made death threats towards family uncalled for....I think soon say we're really better not. Flu season beginning ugh ugh ugh Yeah Tuskegee Experiment left lasting wound community. Yes, slow enrollment. I’m stating see clinic, may may good sample.

They’re paying roughly $2,000 spread 40-50 different payments - per visit, per phone call, etc. 2 years reloadable MasterCard. cares dangerous is? still kills people! fine spreading disease kill someone? sympathy lot impoverished nations let people used guinea pigs new products using chemical agents... Also prisoners broke college students. obviously intend anything bad I'd like let know referring black people ""blacks"" great. \*clap\* \*clap\* \*slower clap\* understand reopening super high risk places like bars. It’s easy low hanging fruit eliminate. Compensate bar owners keep closed. Guaranteed month less Chicago spike cases directly related reopenings. think mean team player “let individual thing don’t really want do, help less fortunate/the next generation/society whole.”

That’s hard thing boomers subscribe message really pushed boomer generation (and gen x) importance individual success means necessary—a “Get Yours” mentality led dog-eat-dog society currently live in. specifically makes say that? may get prosecuted stocks. release vacinne effective bad side effects it'll kill stock. see difference spreading something known multiple times dangerous infectious flu honestly think right now. can’t smell. heart racing. stomach upset since yesterday. 

I don’t know. Take say grain salt. really don’t feel good idk is.  research virus mutation alarmist it. Exactly! sympathy me. expect country large US. whack-a-mole. countries successfully kept things moving declining hospitalization I’ll play along. 

What’s alternative? want Zero-COVID maintaining democracy? That’s possible. virtue signal without that?  Well that’s flat untrue. look list emergency mandates come state governors. 

COVID-19 like flu, can’t prevent it, it’s inevitable vaccine sort. “restrictions” ways bureaucracy wield despotism. would also seeking sweet release death lived sweaty racist shit swamp Oh boy, POTUS tv right announcing new rapid test, whole thing gonna get blamed resultant increase testing. groups currently meeting mean longer exist. still websites such. i'd still look serve groups possible serving many clients within groups. reason suggested limit risk think there's good way limit risk adding/removing air winter, unless able use church building something. cutting hair 30x30 15x15 room surely better 10x10, guess? haha REXwarrior don’t go r/conservative exactly saying.

Unfortunately, COVID19 become issue along party lines, instead people civic duty try keep everyone safe. Good luck spreading misinformation sub. easy /r/michigan This. Maybe even wash hands more. Lmfaaooooo that? It’s shown wearing cloth mask/scarf slow spread. misconceptions cloth masks huge problem though, would agree. main thing cloth masks/scarves meant protect you, little effect preventing *you* getting virus. However, cloth masks scarves help prevent transmitting virus people. recommendations wear masks *in conjunction* preventative measures. Look, play “what about” game sit explain things you, look things (preferably Fox given content post comment on). It’s you. sympathize frustration, knows \*might\* wake one person worth sharing type stories. I'm covid deniers, hurt least trying get least one cautionary tale. go see friends whenever want long willing deal consequences. rapid antibody tests shit. bought ones made NADAL used Germany. One person village got confirmed swab test, dropped tests came back negative. symptomatic already feeling better time swab test couple weeks least antibody tests. yet said killed amout flu would kill 2-3 yrs

You missed part seasonal flu population many immune individuals one time vs novel coronavirus ripping completely naive population like hot knife butter. worst SARS-CoV-2 offer even strong seasonal flu, seasonal flu naive population would utterly devastating whole another level experience ensuress not. Huge, I’m concerned year’s holiday season. Society whole puts way many burdens ""essential workers"" compensate well all. feel like, many ways, western society, particularly United States, upside be. see No, stop trying build straw man. clear that's wrote. need rely deliberate bad faith misrepresentations people's comments order make argument, clear problem logic, way around. better solution? not. would prefer nothing, subset population die.

There solution pandemic worked vaccines even invented quarantine. Whether details different places times really point, it? tool toolbox have, many argument handle diseases way going forward

There many proven steps take fight disease, well known well documented previous administrations pandemic plan, workshops tried inform current administration best practices. current administration, like you, preferred ignore good advice harsh experience earned, pretend pandemic would go away based optimism. 

It work. Nothing done far worked, leadership failed, patriotism failed, cooperation failed, people like spread negative sentiment methods probably would work everybody cooperated, many people determined deplorable. Interesting Moderna complaining weeks ago slowed vaccine development enough black people, stated unpaid...in sub.

I smell misinformation... pandemic. Authoritarian governors mayors plunging millions poverty. Yes graduating spring.

I dont disagree poor children disadvantage saying C+ pretty low bar. “If blame protests, liberals responsible Covid cases” No, please save master. Show way. still nowhere near enough testing done. Scissor timbers supremely related topic. 

Government media fear-mongering terrified people extent foregoing basic health measures cost lives prevents COVID-19 deaths. December nobody US except maybe high ranking government officials even heard it. !Remindme 2 years can’t people wear damn mask?! Illinois 3.2% positivity rate. shouldn’t hard get thing control states. restrictions Illinois aren’t even cumbersome. Yes, wear mask everywhere, still dine restaurants. Death comes party Peggy also lost takeout, heard went nuts lines drive through. don’t think every single state would react limitations lifted tomorrow fooling yourself. many anti-maskers Texas. get bad. bars!!! friends reporting usual spots chugging along nothing going on. masks, sharing drinks, eating wings, toasting shots, smoking cigs, high fiving touchdowns... Theres getting demographic. guarantee cases. So... wear mask don't... what... get stern frown? 3 weeks later campus neighbors campus 20 pneumonia flu cases including me.

And many previous year time? Ever see video putting N95? Genius little fellow US?

Not exactly loss yell anyone, definitely shop there. soon vaccine bets off.  Imagine military member battalion commander needs approve leave lifetime event way, say no. Whether parents long distance girlfriend, sucks. saw Florida continent? Well, mandatory 14d quarantine helps really good contact tracing. Also since force foreigners pay Q creates disincentive foreigners even come quarantine. third outbreak largely caused large exceptions quarantine. Namely domestic helpers workers like truck drivers seamen.

Cases single digits last week.

1.8 million people tested many tested positive. 32? That's .00177% positivity rate.

Theres almost local cases left long quarantine prevent imported cases.

The solutions election Pro-Beijing government sandbagging obvious reasons.

It making look weaker weaker time goes on. Like kid swears teacher homework needs bit time find it. like Tabletop Board games go Gnome Games. super nice teach games ask to. also TON community outreach school visits. think point every American citizen access availability reliable, scientific information. make conscious decisions whether use it. Every adult already decided camp fall - ignoring issue, half-assing it, legitimately taking precautions. respect Fauci think late game he, scientists epidemiologist going much move people one camp other. whole issue gotten personal, tribal political. people saying appalling people marching thousands “protests” barely get people now. doubt able convince people live like another year even without vaccine Considering 5 new cases Australia today, definitely possible. mention states like WA single local case 5 months preprint peer reviewed Nd read study says quite different things implied title abstract. shotty article. want real info listen TWIV podcast YouTube. FYI SARS probably COVID-19 survive 2+ years sub 40 degree weather absence UV. Waves work like that. increase sucks. I'm anything minimal necessity runs around year. I'm waiting see stand initial rounds vaccinations. Also waiting vaccination agencies distribution process less politicized. looks good next summer (probably will) I'll down. First rounds go front line essential workers anyway. I'm totally fine chilling home wearing masks another year. 200k extremely inaccurate inflated number deaths reported strictly COVID. keep government says, they’ll keep safe! cut Florida off? related topic? think government telling doctors can't vaccinate? heard one before. Source ? Hoping people death? better them? get point, experiments labs perfectly healthy guinea pigs could die suffer lifelong health issues.  never said US healthcare system good even mentioned it, rather simply pointing Chinese one fundamentally flawed begin Related, start Christmas shopping early year. Like October early.

So distribution systems straining deal pandemic-related shifts retail supply chains?

How well cope majority people Christmas shopping online year?

Start early. Please tell scientist disagreed wrote disagreed? mommy government says okay, means, cast fears aside resume consumerism. Fair enough. real arguments me. South Korea n95-style masks actually filter viruses breathe in. still hard get US. Keeping us safe. Sad. economy lot red flags virus hit. virus catalyst. forget Fed injected $50billion repo market even knew virus? LevyMevy said planning wearing mask majority country vaccinated didnt seem long enough you.

How long want keep wearing mask? gonna melbourne (Australia, know, america) weeks :') Death growth lags least 2 weeks behind case growth obvious reasons. another week likely start seeing deaths.  Thank President Trump! deadly pandemic killing lots people... Japanese get sick, get sick easily that's masks first place (for part). They/we go work nevertheless, wearing mask.  guess winter shake things up, seems. China announced lockdown Wuhan 12 hours ahead time allowed roughly 5 million people leave, stopped international flights Wuhan lockdown could slowed spread. 5 million people going back home villages restriction outbound international flights I'd argue way lockdown carried caused virus spread faster. better extra stuff pantry. gives control.  need stock everything.  stock things without would difficult, case become hard-to-get.  need panic. Continue shop regularly -- top-off stock levels, instead waiting near zero. Uruguay faired well too, despite surrounded chaos. virus suppressed cold sets beatable proactive government. Correct. Since governments experienced issues anything coming close collapse, pandemic blip radar. Total US mortality would increase 10% worst.  Lol course bunch old white dudes photo. explain? believe hype, dumb one That’s good know. 

#NYCStrong💪🏼 Oh Randy. 
I lold Hell, don’t even go back far, look ~~first~~ immigrants North America!  heard can't enforce fines. wonder arrest people though. Heh.  Whats really funny everyone sub thinks Floridians occupying places. live here. morons STILL travelling here, never stopped. STOP FUCKING COMING same. Oh shit...time panic ...apparently huge amount people going get sick symptoms yet ""test positive "" horrible virus relax home 2 weeks. going terrible. mindset might well shrug say “another man’s loss another man’s gain.” think are? kind big figure? need trust?  I'm autistic I'm thinking going group home lives forever. beats isolated apartment rest life. I'll around others stuff company. agree disagree this.

At end April, still fitting data bell curves; curves told pandemic would time August, published that. idiocy. Think back time: could intelligent person really claim full confidence COVID would disappear summer? No!

IHME's head Chris Murray also made excuse along lines ""Our predictions shit, least published shit; publishing shit lot better publishing anything. that, we're awesome!"" reeks arrogance, and, again, complete idiocy. That’s easy say aren’t taking account many different situations - like elders provide family childcare, general - multigenerational living households. telling could mess next decade? think I' rather check early. live society Nice know people civil conversation without mud slinging.

Yeah virus kind got controlled ones started rising control phase last long. behind exactly?

Fall behind school. millions students boat.

There students parents actually care education. Even online classes, fall behind. parents let cheat study. next year mix kids know material kids don't. ones fall even behind. 

There large education gap b/w rich kids poor kids. going make worse. read NY Times wealthy parents paying private teachers education pods. Poor children access computer going able keep coursework. father behind. really think open weeks, shut weeks cycle helping anyone?

The elementary schools area completely open. rates going up. middle schools closed.  significant enough lock entire country wife's family wants us Thanksgiving, sadly despite fervent objections going arguing like talking brick wall. type take virus seriously all. wear masks, stay safe possible go anywhere much possible though. hate we'll make best it... grow ground 9% isnt high, I'm wondering high spread areas doing, mean, isnt NYC like 40% something insane like that.  live Florida, native here... shall continue hide inside fate takes care rest guess. crazy I’m basically saying:

* let’s wear masks public indoor areas 1 year
* let’s continue work home one year (will likely happen anyway)

I quit reading figuring you’re full shit. Luckily, there's also lot overlap two groups group people blindly support Trump regard evidence reality. could outcome Trump strongly pushes vaccine (viewing big political win himself) lot people get anyway Trump. Yes. decreased it’s again. I’ll expand quote isn’t confusing. Didn’t heard? cure going bars drink overpriced beers  hard time understanding comment? 

Who would upset *someone else* wearing mask would throw brick window? early voting FL they? keep going long schools open, people refuse wear masks, lack social distancing, employers keep undermining seriousness staff.

I’ve heard multiple people, employers demand keep coming in, even fail self-reported questionnaires. Isn’t covid (in terms lingering air)? long! 100% true. fall behind, hard catch up. Schools move quickly. say year student gets half-rate education. prepared next year. 

The possibility lost generation Africa, south/southeast Asia, poorer parts West Latin America really troubling. especially missing immigrant kids /sigh know still 1% infection rate. NY tests lot. Like, countries. new contender! hour ago sure EaglesNumberOne nutcase #1 here, JaneSteinberg running too! *astronomia plays* wish, PA 3 months hardest hit counties.

From March-June.

All ""non life sustaining"" businesses closed. Even driving non life sustaining reason illegal got lady pulled over. That's black people already know racist americans are. relax find country-wide hospitalizations? Soon enough, gonna surpass black plague Spanish Flu Wisconsin 2000 cases, Australia 5 cases... thing traveling pandemic largely people think invincible. Younger less likely symptomatic. Risk takers less likely follow rules. cheap. Cheap rooms, cheap activities, cheap beer. contribute much tourism economy.

Irresponsable cheap combo want tourists right now. Yeah, place total SHIT HOLE went Spring Break back late 80s so, cares could get 25 cent beers breakfast. Looks like actually lot better now. limit, almost everyone elses, theres vaccine. dont see wouldnt long enough. 

Its perfectly normal limits. nothing wrong saying that. behavior seems responsible me. many many others sacrificing normal life year half minimize risk people yourself. Hes one good guys. think completely overreacted.  grumpy. 100% true. fall behind, hard catch up. Schools move quickly. say year student gets half-rate education. prepared next year. 



Fall behind exactly?


Tens millions students boat. 

 really think open weeks, shut weeks cycle helping anyone?

Teachers sitting weeks quarrantine every weeks? sick, contact someone was, might be.


And starting flu season.


Education year would best served online classes.


This babysitting hoping one gets seriously ill it. Well least they’re throwing bricks windows. I'm american. pandemic global way. Spanishs, french,russian, south african indians people much better job US.

I see upset people stay home want blame current situation that's fair. parents got virus sister back March - good thing made it, imagine family dinners that. That's said want identify scapegoat blame. young people partying? parents meeting without masks day ? Lot people care among every population (old included), still assume OK meet people indoor 'aka bubble'. victim eternal victim, think point victim respect social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing right? Maybe death saved life along way stopping contamination chain Unlike Florida? Aren’t bars still open Ontario? Literally [first hit Google starting think low-effort ""source?"" quip akin throwing mud opponent, unless reason believe opponent speaking ass. Moon Man choice. Generations? I've never heard before. take long? mean, could right. maybe like flu around forever, that's entirely possible. time, people part protect others, also getting vaccine, may help kick thing ass. also, let expand quoted comment said: even ends covid around forever, think vaccine high degree protection hopefully reality day (i dont see within next 6 months honestly). 

i guess ""if can't beat'em, join'em"" attitude people starting put forth. hey, you. nothing say change mind nothing stop you. take care best can. fact don’t know means total ever total currently active says lot situation. depression gotten much better pandemic, anxiety gotten much worse. Mental health weird.

I feel bad healthcare workers too. People making jobs harder dangerous protecting themselves.  China announced lockdown Wuhan 12 hours ahead time allowed roughly 5 million people leave*

India implemented immediate lockdowns March. Countless people starved death utter China mostly contained outbreak Wuhan alone, since provinces prepared check folks coming Wuhan quarantine them. Dan Murphy's chokers moment due headlines saying ""only 5 cases corona left country"" What?? Nobody knew virus back January rioters still carrying rampage destruction city. government makes informed choices based recommendations experts everyone did, HK initially less affect (plus one wanted come HK riot). problem inported cases highly affected areas like US ,UK India creating new wave cases. watching show lmao get sick stay home.

Otherwise keep calm carry on. Oh boy, birthday. I'll always remember today. That's worries well. one slight positive flu usually comes fever, covid seem much direct correlation.

Either way I'm worried schools going become bigger shitshows. Yeah! Sort like spitting fell favour, communal ladles/dippers drinking water.  Wisconsin never real first wave. ripple. first wave. ""time hospitals"" shit metric Americans free healthcare.

Every hospital visit debt America, even got insurance little ""ER fee"" back card mean ""total visit cost"". include blood work, doctor fee, scans/imaging, reading results blood work imaging scans. top that, needed medications, IV, nasal cannula O2, none covered.

Then there's follow fees 3 day, 7 day, and/or 2 week mark.

And that's assuming complications.

""Time hospital"" bullshit statistic like ""access healthcare"" - seems like something informative entirely meaningless.

Source: Worked healthcare billing years, helped bankrupt rich, poor, insured uninsured alike getting hell whole system. guys ever read Rainbow Six Tom Clancy...? Ya Wow, pretty much every place go (around Tampa area) nearly everyone wearing masks. EVERY business go requires store, restaurant, MUST wear going in, out, restroom. sure USA, people Sydney hunker winter cold cold enough go play snow.

Also, lockdowns measures combating covid19 like Asia instead Europe/USA, I'm sure much bigger impact season.

Also also, covid numbers never went control easier contain virus. yeah sad said first would lockdown 2 weeks lockdown 6 months school time go none students vaccine thing. doctors say school safe. School reopened what's point bring laptop zoom LIKE WHAT. None till vaccine. dont agree everything trump think great hes vaccine officials keep saying UNsAFe matter numbers show. Also always thing mind corona? numbers gone corona thats point care deaths deaths gone lot. Remember new york get help states? Yeah dont anymore. A. hospital? live Boston, one hardest hit cities US. never came close running beds. rule, exception across US.

B. March. People avoided hospitals last six months. guilty skipped cancer screening appointment May. many plates NY/NJ past month. Fortunately, I'm avoiding humans like I'm supposed 🤘🏽 freedoms include right endanger lives others. Keep damn germs yourself. US seen worse economic hit country. Turns planning deal problem, like Korea Sweden did, terrible idea all. Obviously dont much experience public days know what's going on. Hello Wisconsin!

Active cases dropped 571. Damn, least somewhat kind. Would tell gammy suck cause 10 years away death? Cremate. What's natural fire? made sure get kids vaccination flu shots. Covid isn’t dangers there. friends family willing sacrifice milestones? He’s definitely bullshitting engineer. abstract critical thinking way two concrete type engineering analysis. Example unable connect covid plus comorbid conditions equal untimely death. Probably sanitation engineer.  Back March, husband’s hospital, people skipped medical care full covid patients ran beds. fear mongering needed. husband unable see regular patients deal covid patients. It’s almost like new disease comes spread quickly, could overwhelm hospital system.  actually cause highs understand, it’s something user supposed watch slowly increase time used make sure doesn’t cause issues. Idiots Seriously, I’ve seen post many different entries. many people affected virus greater degree modern flu. Many continuing experience symptoms complications many months “recovery”. isn’t disappearing election doesn’t care whether believe exists not. promise quarantine beforehand, I'll share parents promise tease dad Christmas dvd crackling fire plays day. 

I grateful day raised liberals south. I'm still sure dad brother grew political leanings did. fb brother posted video guy targeting idea. Theres supposedly flu vaccine 6% death rate elderly. conclusion covid big deal, vaccine accessible. I’ve complete lockdown since March. friends, restaurants, boss made return office 1 person it’s relatively safe wear mask. sanitize constantly wear masks 100% time outside home. 

My question is: overkill? Every year group 4-6 friends drive NC together (USA) stay rental 5 days so. hike, eat, drink, go museums stuff. It’s hang out. It’s always last days December, nearly 3 months now.

Obviously impression cancelled still want happen. dangerous? GF live asthmatic, take seriously, don’t know we’re going top not, it’s impossible tell what’s safe isn’t.

Is mask public, keeping groups less 7, sanitizing/washing often really enough?? Right, agree young kids can’t expected self-motivated. so, burden right lies parents. ever. 

I used teach kids autism, can’t imagine hard parents kids special needs right now. We're fine GA. limited restrictions. Leggo! Yep. Welcome 2020 I'm asking one example someone Muslim critical Islam labelled Islamophobe. Coronavirus killed people US entire population Birmingham, Alabama. clarify, saying last weeks/months sweden low death rate? (checks worldometers real quick) seven day moving average sweden 10 last two months. kind number puts par south dakota US. 

proportionally would similar florida less 20 covid deaths per day period. know know swedish, looked florida stats previous years. 20 deaths per day florida would par heart disease, Alzheimer, diabetes far frequency. Wait, really happened? fucking mental health entire populations one seems particularly concerned discussing it. 

Apologies understanding, ""we"" there? train dogs choose favorite toy two boxes, time toy paired sweat positive patient, eventually dog learns recognize effluent specific covid positive subjects. detect virus directly, instead specific change smell sweat covid-19 positive people. dogs trained quickly might prove essential reopening world travel early, future pandemics. fucking easy find.

No not.

 ""That HALF Qatar’s percentage somehow things worse US.""

 Yes US almost 10 times death rate per 100k. Covid situation clearly much worse US per 100k even Qatar caught higher amount actual infections. NY New Jersey even break top 10 US metric, even though things got worse state. (Better now, nobody actually caught yet). Qatar clearly worst hit country Covid, anywhere close it, despite amount infections successfully tested. Italy UK even make top 20 *Europe* metric, clearly good relative reflection much worse relative elsewhere.

The rise French cases currently worse US per capita, doubt. concerning. necessary many places hit hard been, saw outbreak like italy, spain, especially new york city.

But places US taken fuck regards precaution deaths start going hospitals start getting full. Fuck it. Let's reopen everything. cause know study mean exist.

[They're talking really ""backside"" all. would assume that? TRANSLATE: ""not good place""

Judging downvotes, negative replies, name calling etc. would obvious 7 year old leaves Nancy. keep denying keep replying lmao think people realize shouldnt worried number dead. worried number cases too. large number young adults here, sure, long term consequences turn dangerous we'll probably largest number people disability 10 years now. mitigating factor UK one greatest underestimates death toll Western world government even nerve remove 5,000 deaths already underestimated death toll.

In excess deaths UK still worse US deaths per million. wrong, proudly wrong, unable justify position, also flatly refuse educate future might less wrong.. Must easy life head empty. heard? Consequences poor people. Every country's media bud. corporate houses money business.

Not sure right place! 

Question concerning blowing fresh air sucking air room.

So gf hairdresser business connected home.

With winter nearing im trying make safe possible gf clients. would probably best option? Thanks advance! actual covid deaths (excess deaths, since official death toll underestimated beginning BoJo 5,000 victims resurrected decided can't die covid 28 days), UK competes Spain worst hit country Europe. Black lives matter. 

To refuse white privilege. — Dr. Anthony Fauci says Americans likely need wear masks stay socially distanced protect coronavirus vaccine becomes available.  tells senators hearing vaccine won’t change conditions overnight.  vaccine availability go giant step controlling infection, you’re going completely eradicate eliminate it,” Fauci says.  unusual vaccine 100% effective, says. Also, people skeptical vaccinations may avoid getting shot.  there’s enough vaccine available entire U.S. population, take time distribute shots.

I think title (shockingly!) misleading. least first glance.

He's saying we'll continue masking social distancing Americans vaccinated. 

He's saying (a) whenever vaccine first made widely available general population, (b) point we'll COVID less control, there's massive gap.

A gap created anti-vaxxers, ponderous bureaucracies logistics distribution, forth.

And gap, gotta keep masks social distance. I.e. can't celebrate run throw huge indoor parties second vaccine finally confirmed starts getting distributed vulnerable Americans essential workers. makes sense course. Studies? Sorry, believe random YouTube videos Facebook memes. Ok, well 10 euros sound like something wealthier access. idea person meant could trust published numbers Except person UK... I'm saying obesity low IQ positive correlation, I'm saying may external factors we're looking made people obese. may choice ""put broccoli pick potato chips"" speak, may factors people's control. 

Sure, self-control factor, put big plate candy front everyone society even want there, going increase obesity people's will. link info pertaining topic please! want know!  survival channel drop bunch fox news hosts island third world country try survive? Fox News somehow count media zero mistrust science. complete mistrust administration desires. herd grows increasingly resistant transmission virus.

Except get resistant transmission virus.

This virus likely human race less permanently like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1.

Will grow resistant effects virus people generate humoral memory B cells either exposure vaccination subsequent infections less severe.  cringe. fat boy better job know sick! Many sick people *asymptomatic*. know that. aware it. want accept it. 

This novel virus spreads rapidly among people even know it. That's social isolation necessary get vaccine.

I'm young, probably die COVID (although lost plenty ""1%"" scenarios, thrilling thought). However, live USA healthcare save you, spend rest life working debt.

I want long term organ damage also cause untold amounts debt doctor hospital visits. 

The fear death (sadly), fear long term health concerns crushing debt garbage healthcare system, conservatives unwilling help fix. weird. article discusses immune system, posted (to stay) science sub r/COVID19 what? Misinformation? real monster virus lurking behind. It’s even worse that, US done right thing would locked sooner, control. 
 
It’s almost like “the right” thinks “the left” believes would 0 deaths wasn’t Trump, simply isn’t case. absolutely would deaths, possibly thousands more. wouldn’t 200k+, economy wouldn’t shambles. sorry - offtopic useless fact:

You people disgusting. Yea somewhat ineffective without good contact tracing policy, think states currently place (too much fear it'll violate rights privacy, etc).

I'm sure exactly answer there. think we're pretty much own, even everything done. Basically waiting vaccines become available minimum year people like I. 25's either. many fucking 30-40 person parties, bridal showers, ect. standard many countries vis-a-vis US.

Need vaccine need effective vaccine? Vaccines perfect, everybody takes develop immunity. fact, 90% developing immunity taking vaccine considered extremely good, COVID vaccines likely effective. IIRC, CDC said they'd approve anything 70% effective (7 10 taking vaccine develop immunity).

If need 75% population immunity may need closer 95% taking vaccine. Thanks try City market? How's sensationalist Sorry clear. looking sources saying surge based reinfections, new infections.

Yeah, world seems pretty normal venture groceries US Roosevelt proudly defeated fascists, including killing them. Punching neo-fascist indirectly causes deaths tens thousands Americans huge step towards tolerance. That’s huge assumption..? shit serious. However, go back look coverage beginning pandemic. Lots coverage downplayed severity disease quick dismissal. course. think pointed out. cdc longer independent agency. one regime. occurred mostly central southern Minnesota, rural areas pent-up resentment spring statewide shutdown, indoor mask mandate bar restaurant restrictions.

This key point here. There's ""both sides"" this. racist rural people regurgitating politically driven disinformation they've fed. people sized situation decided right thing threaten completely civil strangers trying perform community service.  anyone wanna post TLDR ? Increases due DSHS releasing hundred, sometimes thousands old cases day. exactly point exactly date. Wisconsin smaller population therefore statistical noise, best way see 7 day rolling average data http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/. case data inflect ~101 days ago (6/18), deaths ~76 days ago (7/13). One former roommates sort condition always lost sense taste smell throughout life. roommate got COVID informed us that. point could lose sense taste smell due COVID think anything it. tested negative moved out.

One roommates full ecstatic gyms opened never considered virtue taking risk, risk taken everyone household.  choose like believe hundreds thousands deaths, lack food,, burning Rome nothing mental health.

Ok marathon runner died this, biker can’t bike cuz this, mis-c, organ failure reported people survive, massive scars lungs. Need go on? reason want talk deaths.

Increases DSHS releasing hundreds older cases day. Testing positivity rate across board. BS. handful cases day US right everyone sub would still demand continuous lockdown. choose like believe hundreds thousands deaths burning Rome nothing mental health. testing pretty quick easy takes week get results, hell knows actual case count like here. say active cases county tripled like week, imagine bad actually is. say year. Thats im thinking.

Or better yet - imagine many could bought legal fees district spend. Hopefully countersue every penny plus administrative time first saw morning read ""[...]test rates *drop* 25% [...]"" thought ""Huh, that's good news."" little later, I'm fully awake, re-read see mistake. No, fact, good news. could presented serious issue start. presented big deal, people went wanted. Like 0.3% it. 0,6% infected die, lucky herd immunity kicks 50% populatiob, means 0.3% pop die. 

It's like 200 000 UK. yeah might through. herd immunity! Period. Remember many deaths Sweden had, versus Norway Denmark?

You've seen Atlantic say ""herd immunity strategy"", you? mention recent cases reinfection? say ""nothing worry about""; that's virus became pandemic first place! would differentiate symptoms virus symptoms factors? think that's possible do. bad rules 2020 consequences can't keep madness. said China figured half world would assume Chinese Taipei included :)

Edit: posted actually read article. guess sue herself. Heard radio day Israel lead per capita basis. article doesn’t give good feels. know pharmaceutical companies never lied anyone! Deaths going come time. Hospitalizations started studies showing even unreported cases still wouldnt make India higher US unreported cases too. 

I India rest argument BS. studies showing unreported cases still wouldnt make India higher. many honor killings fatal threats retaliations women report US compared India. 

And argument men women around lot less shouldnt much rape shows ignorant everything. logic, shouldnt 1.4 billion population right? Cause men women around lot less communities, much fucking going on? think proximity motivator rape? victim blaming, thats shameful. 

Most rapes countries done people know/related female victim date rape. Stop spreading ignorant views. Damn good raincoat police could far strict mask wearing rather nothing all. Yea must stressful murdering innocent brown kids Come on. already know well prevalent rural pops months. practically zero restriction movement India currently.

And Victoria showing infective virus is, anything drastically different compared rest country, penetrated crack one quarantine location.

So yes, Melbourne longer quarantine, whole parts country fortunate enough open months. Now, they've almost wrestled things back levels (and states are).

The state I'm daily scores zero cases day still restrictions Florida. insane - Florida.

Sure, New Zealand's first lockdown got 100 days cases second much shorter first. They're going able much closer approximate like started much rest world.

Anyway, there's number countries pulled (Vietnam, Taiwan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka on) especially Vietnam quite large. flare ups happen, since apparatus there, likely detected whatever measures necessary taken stomp again.

The benefit pulling lockdown early long enough effective people much closer Americans much lower chance getting thing getting sick.

The alternative? frightful think about. underreporting US. Absolutely none  goalposts sneakily changed flattening curve eradicating virus, 

They weren't.

The plan flatten curve **slowly** open back **new normal** keeping case counts trending mostly while. case counts spike up, loss life mitigated greatly.

Imagine US sitting 4k daily new cases, spikes caused schools colleges opening would far less concerning.

But screwed re-opening. Cases floating much higher every spike hurts more.

The sad thing cost establishing lower baseline much. weeks lockdown areas get testing up, stepping slowly phases instead rushing bars open, mask mandates early April. county, safety. can’t find county stats. mobile game world small! I'd rather take chances virus comply lockdown rules. “If attempt change argument something not, always right! Man, love high-quality scientific intelligent discussion sub!” Same, brainwashed. #MissMyDad #ReleaseTheTrumpHold talking about. *You* stated France Qatar ""in considerably worse shape US counted per 100k population"" response post Covid deaths.

A little empathy restore souls restore basic humanness.

Criticize covid 19 is, pandemic caught everyone globally unpepared except countries laid waste resources could used effectively arrest spread.  Um, open limited capacity mask mandates social distancing measures place. Also, least nephew's school district yet resumed in-person instruction last week. sure, let's throw caution wind pretend there's COVID get back 100% capacity masks. reserve right visit all. NJ highest per capita death rate country. guys hardly good example follow. run mill antidepressants ruined life ya FDA can't trusted. drugs approved heavily manipulated 6-8 week studies leave kids years decades. approve drugs based studies literally never happened. unbelievable. Here's proof. vast majority people going things essentials point. Hate break you.  find really offensive BO encourages people keep distance. That's it, let out! I'm vent frustrations!

I know bad day. Maybe autistic episode. It'll pass, never autistic. okay though. tards end living pretty good lives. last wife tarded. pilot now! bands break? reuse infinitely? “If play highly specific unreasonable rules, I’m always right!

What’s frustrating think know better everyone else referring U.S. death toll basis comparison, so, no, that's irrelevant argument. Prof. Drosten really buffed response, scientist, political advisor science communicator. instrumental rolling testing system enabled us see pandemic filled hospitals.

it's Abstract Nature article gov waited everyone move uni residences immediately told oops can't leave now. Gotta grab rent money suppose. Even 90% classes online they'd totally fine stayed home That's Bad Luck Bertha I've ever heard one say schools policymakers must prioritize vulnerable population pandemic laid bare precarious nature pursuing degree raising people aren’t understanding student parents much intersectionality prior covid-19 — housing insecurity, front-line workers, school-aged children,” said Nicole Lynn Lewis, founder Generation Hope, D.C. nonprofit helps teen parents earn college degrees. “And pandemic, layers upon layers difficulty talked addressed.” Seems like side effects rare outliers grand scheme things. still disconcerting nothing live fear opinion. 

Just like healthy young people die covid yet rare exception statistically rounding error. state 5 million people 22 people age 40 died 55,477 known cases certainly way account asymptomatic cases mild cases people get tested. blame everyone else (including Fauci) stupidity. Listen Vince Racaniello. Society guess. Good question. 24 year old female here, I’ve ER 3 times since got covid early March. Several lung x rays, blood tests, lung function test waiting results echocardiogram. I’ll randomly sitting couch heart rate spike, I’ve shortness breath/chest tightness whole time. got sick nothing really, really bad flu never went hospital. shit isn’t joke. I’ve told “oh could this” “it could anxiety” like 6 months seriously spare me, y’all gotta take shit seriously. Duh dumbshit! else think deal monster bed? Lol, it’s disregarded exactly I’m going link handful studies I’d dig mobile... 

They pre- post-operational data. Data collected window within hours, extrapolate folks wearing masks 8+ hours day, everyday. Additionally, doesn’t take mathematician label drop 96% “small change.” need drop what, 90%, brain cells start dying...

No problem. Glad could broaden understanding, Holmes. Allergies bad year. cold season quickly approaching. I, personally, getting tested every sniffle sneeze id get tested every day. can’t forget people exist world. Again, said, poor people suffer every day avoidable diseases won’t put work stop dying apparently don’t matter **NATURAL** herd immunity thing. people saying say ""herd immunity"". They're talking letting virus infect millions people.

What’s TL;DR? never claimed to. lockdown cult claimed knew lockdowns would ""save lives"" that's total upending civil liberties, livelihoods social relations justified, even though never done history.

Are getting it? positive test rate remained low* Extreme poverty eating ramen. Extreme poverty literally starving death roof head. data point using like really fucking bad. Let see explain it.

1. lower death rate irrelevant also many infections. Using link, Australia 3.5 deaths per capita USA 62.5. bad. complete failure stop infections resulted people dying.

2. stats ignore excess death rate. US 2-5 deaths due corona virus, they're flagged non-corona deaths. Look excess death rate.

To put absolutely terrible arguments perspective: know whats better 3% death rate 7 million infections? 50% death rate 6 infections. Yes death rate higher, infection stopped mean overall people survive pandemic ""to see loved ones.""

The best cure prevention. matter many survive virus, matters many survive pandemic overall (and arguably without infected since virus disability rate too)  God, like dumbest people. candidates C0vidi0ts Go! game. "" "" doubt India healthcare numbers run private enterprise gauntlet number fixing.  


Now USA though, know Florida, Texas many states intentionally counting testing. negative Chinese government negative Chinese people. I'm fan American government, whole think average American pretty good person. Explain re-open now? Disneyworld reopened cases didnt climb. Schools re-opened cases climb. re-open last remaining stores? States unlike fed allowed run deficits.

Not overly familiar states run: saying states technically green? think talking USA? people third world countries die preventable diseases? people matter they’re American (or, likely, they’re white)? Watch cable news, feel better. failing spectacularly, failing collectively...whatever means you, suppose...Simply, playing game trying get everyone play you, complete ruleset pieces.

I'm ever forced wear reusable half face respirator big pink p100 filters. Yeah, along lines. would also think less people get flu, less people go doctors, meaning less exposure/more effective use resources.

Trump said 15 cases would zero couple days. obviously happen. cringey call everyone ""kid"" like cant speak normally someone's level.

How USA manage get wrong,? lol US shutting asylum man, why'd return favor? social economic impact didn’t though. really back living fully? back attending concerts, sporting events nightclubs? 

99 percent us aren’t. Yay ferrets! Sacrificing floofy lives help us one ever convince person right end life. post personal decision ever make. hope rests peace. Blame Sweden promoted entire approach. exact part post false? said someone lied me, part?  FTFY:

**Waterboarding weasel** Ottawa, believe absolutely stupid selfish people being. Even wear masks, walk ass like shadow brush past - even wear properly. Neighbours across street throwing weekly drunkfest parties like 15 people past 1 Bylaw never comes called. Old fuckers everywhere care whether live die, masks distancing. 75-year old roomie/landlord loves walking dog get fresh air/exercise can't trust without keeping distance (doesn't even watch bloody thing takes her), we've sadly stop it. Calls guys put new windows wear mask distance. unexpected friends visiting wear mask distance. Like, we're trying look us tenants fair like living fucking six-year-old care world. one person; several lives livelihoods. make matters tiring, husband works long term care home thankfully spared outbreaks, he's constantly giving minimize risk *and* there. already know friends caught royally fucked long-term complications, brother one Iran died despite ""perfectly healthy."" pandemic joke; real joke - sick one - every person take seriously. That's we're essentially back square one.

Why hard stay fuck home ""social"" bit, able it? people lasted week 1918. everyone home higher risk complications, goddamn nightmare trying get alongside population largely can't bothered care. everything ""conspiracy."" Literally everything hangs balance bastards sit down, shut stay home.

Almost wishing they'd mandate - every single person - month kill thing good. least drag on. government much - also use fucking brains. dying, getting sick spreading people actually vulnerable. top that, still idea mid long-term effects illness are. Limiting amount contact happening best way slow spread wait vaccine.

You'd think would obvious people, are... would doctors need catch Covid figure things out? mind calling OP murderer. know try go back somewhat normal still taking precautious right? either go outside six months anti science/anti mask, majority people. Beside even know OP from, maybe live big issue. fast catching Quebec (who reported 896 cases yesterday 750 cases today 8.48 million people). week's category Jeopardy ""Catchy headlines heard 6 months straight"" Give time, numbers grow. undeniable new cases dropped Manaus, though. attribute almost like Masks dont stop completely. 🥇 Vote... whole sides narrative bullshit point. I'm registered democrat, clear see party completely sided rich *at expense* poor everything protect rich expense poor. HATE people reach take nametag. step back take off, give them. realllyyyy care seeing I’m legitimate, wouldn’t stepping close something often wonder, hopefully someone else actual answer.

Personally assume way: less widespread (because extrapolate whole population, power %).... purpose policy, think risk “doubled” it’s known risk, assumed one. least purposes tracing locking down, know fact twice many people infected infect others. don’t know makes sense, don’t think mutually exclusive. Maybe stupid! Black people likely avoid doctors U.S. government long history secretly testing black citizens without knowledge I'm even close suicidal I'm pretty sure depression level notched bit beginning summer.  I'm kind dreading fall winter shut-in. national lockdowns incoming then? slippery goal viruses constantly mutating. One strain appears contained immune response ones suddenly start zero again. Also, virus becomes widespread mutations appear makes former scenario likely. many things go wrong herd immunity.

This shitshow end vaccine, even threat virus reappearing constant due zoonotic spread. Hope next time people idiotic enough infect recklessly. Foxnews made US response pandemic exponentially worse

Foxnews made US ~~response pandemic~~ exponentially worse. crack even border. Nothing said changes point media fear mongers reason young healthy people like afraid leave house. share frustration - fellow NYer, I'm tired people constantly saying ""everyone NY would gotten it, already it"". even remotely. I'm still lockdown (close 6 months now), wear mask every second I'm outside, basically go every 1 1-1/2 weeks grocery shopping, drop laundry picking packages (the risk took go non-covid related funeral someone knew life). I'm one extremely lucky ones happens still job, place business good enough us WFH (which extended next March).

Hell, half apartment floor died first 2 months Covid (2 5 apartments still empty months): one neighbor lived 25 years died hospital. Another lived 15+ years found wellness check Police. deaths found weeks later due lockdown, happened across Super throwing garbage. bad shit happening necessarily come massive fanfare - freaking crazy almost half floor permanently disappeared barely whisper. viewers don’t care. makes feel good watch it, consistency &amp; information damned. Yes, exactly. Although missing 1 leg 20% disabled. VA determines %. father 15% disabled hearing loss think 50% back issues caused helicopter crash. done much damage last 20 years may never recover. surprising since almost vaccine trials, blacks under-represented. 94.5% isn’t even close current IFR. one Minnesota pushing narrative soread occuring meat plants, prisons old folks, don’t know bring up. know community spread happening. 

My point think it’s disingenuous report record high number cases report also record high number tests, report positive test rate. record number cases along record number tests expected. ""News agencies"" purposely lie pandemic would countries, fucking **corrupt flawed US** apparently. ""news agencies"" spew **lies**

Fox news allowed many countries, **because keep lying** tell sub sad thousands dying. Sad.  Animal challenge trial, still... Sounds fantastic? Someone tell something get excited about, once/twice weekly dosage noted. big states? less 5 million population? Yup fuck him. Enjoy ICU..... would estimate drunk around £1700 worth paid penny.

It's taxpayer funded, fact helped stock bar! Hitchens great thoughtful atheist commentator, came pretty quickly publicly Bush Admin War Terror (probably really like Islam). Like supporters, downplayed torture US intelligence officers enemy combatants, claiming harsh people saying.

Hitchens ended support torture someone challenged get waterboarded, experience, convinced bad was. Shortly afterwards, dropped support War Terror too, ineffectual.

His waterboarding occurred lasted something like 43 seconds. IL perfect least they're risking citizens lives tax money.

No, they're pretending issue begging federal government bailout.

Make mistake, New York Illinois states (and NYC Chicago particular) measurably fucked Florida cities, they're choosing ignore fucked bank someone else bailing out. heard Tuskegee? many dead total? % total deaths come nY? “good” cause killed vulnerable early.  cares, going see data. makes black community feel better independent docs okay it, good them, lets hope political agenda either. proven wrong within next month so. don’t like conspiracy theories, entire thing fishy said day one.

Back early Jan-feb getting videos China people walking along collapsing streets. Look, virus dangerous literally didn’t happen anywhere, clearly propaganda.

But it’s propaganda really worked, world shit scared looked China see handled virus, extreme lockdown measures. literally introduced us idea locking modern world gobbled like little fish terrified collapsing street. 

Well China open, flaunting rest world destabilized still adhering ridiculous fucking lockdown measures virus turned significantly less lethal early videos showed. 

Are fucking stupid, seriously? 

And please, sometime comments ‘I’ll-informed’ give goddam example. Blame people refusing return job asks get room non-compliant children (who defiant due parents' attitudes) supplied PPE, crappy cheap cloth mask. Blame people refusing sit room non-compliant people six hours stretch. Blame refusing community shown true colors calling assholes Facebook refusing sacrifice parents get kids house hence stop bothering them. 


Aight chief. else top 0.1% get even richer screwing rest us? reading pleasure, reiterate original Swedish CONSTITUTION forbids

Sweden already done, deny possible, entire municipality Gällivare. serious lockdown, Denmark ever deemed necessary.

Your original point incorrect. corrected you, believe little nuanced. problem brigaders post things edit posts look reasonable don’t get banned usually comments removed, spend rest time harassing us trying combat misinformation speaking experiences. last two weeks I’ve harassed, downvoted, PM’d, followed posting high risk, I’ve staying safe, viewpoint society get burn quicker (not dropping masks precautions right vaccine out). I’ve people tell deserve die this, called fascist, told multiple times I’m mentally unwell sick deranged, trolls get heavily upvoted. It’s really control don’t know answer they’ve learned play line.

ETA: one harassers who’s done outlined right me, SMH 🤦🏼‍♀️ welcome go history see it. Nothing I’ve said unreasonable, especially high risker wonder if, don’t know, reopening schools anything this. believe combination lot things.  like using analogy lot reasons can't think other. WW2 it, Nazi's persecuted killed jews mass. packed stuff got could. thought stay fight it. got rounded ghetto's old jewish rabbi's believed could reason Nazi's. nothing hoped passed. like example lot reasons think characterizes spectrum responses ominous impending threats. opinion really make sense, especially retrospect, decisions made emotions. Emotions rational. opinion, people going like nothing happening change behavior something resonates emotional core. numbers study going convince them. manage achieve herd ~~immunity~~ mentality, judging Swedish online presence here! Thank you, read whole article commenting. MS Huh... looking husband? I'm looking wife put aside free healthcare. inlaws still going place FL year. say friends either gone want alone. also figure safe gated community socialize outside it. hope right. Fauci obviously mention good job, instead praises NJ governor despite rise cases. Wonder why? holy fucking shit.  mystery - election time US, region pursued different strategy, governments lead differently, broadly we've done well. None things go well regime that's spent billion dollars seeking re-election, see ~~people~~ accounts come woodwork talk dictator ""you guys can't even leave state"" that. potential US voter wanders through, tell road took good other, somehow worked way could. Okay bud, 15 people agree risks help shorten process months years, millions continue get sick thousands die. ethics correct, sometimes risks need taken people willing take risk tell wrong? like trails today placebo walking around thinking might protected. like one risking getting sick. Sorry hear see someone's extra step ahead literally never will. get downvoted suggesting US posts. people barely want wear ongoing pandemic, *never* wear cold flu get back sort ""normalcy"". Hahahahaha Vaccine excuse people go back normal without care. force feeding, waterboarding.  I'm sorry hear that. wish nothing best. isnt. means numbers incorrect along lower amount positives reported incorrectly made look higher actually are. can't stop sharing articles people think covid hoax real whatever get serious case? like, fucking shit people take seriously gonna get virus, articles never going reach people anyway. means feeling superior someone else much beyond actually done complete nationwide lockdown 6-8 weeks could slowed spread almost completely halt. good contact tracing could contained. Instead nothing nation. one state locked neighboring state wide open slow spread. states mainly responsible national downward trend cases deaths.  I'd say danger point ranks 49 order per capita deaths Look recent polls many willing take one. I'm complete idiot speak this. friends waterboarded eachother around time happened. really horrible terrifying. no, even complete idiot would say iant horrible. willfully ignorant. True genius here. nation wide one state. understand someone wanting wear one demanding remove one? ""Hey, shirts beach!"" anyone ever heard seen see-through masks? Trying figure teach mostly deaf kid reads lips classroom setting mask required. 

From understanding face shields really anything option. suggestions would much appreciated! India's Total Cases per 1M population far better global Average.  Daltry, Townsend, Moon, Entwistle? cost. two shot shingles shot, Medicare covered people $380 copay. new vaccines probably even expensive. anyone see Republican Congress passing bill cover every citizen? Fat chance. least they'll learn change.

😂 It’s crazy doctors won’t talk people needing loose weight overweight. trying get pregnant first child doctor told way skinny needed gain 15-20lbs get pregnant. 5’9 135lbs time underweight healthy weight(20 pounds gained actually would put near overweight category). got new doctor actually gave meds get pregnant(come find don’t ovulate that’s didn’t get pregnant). guess fat new norm
And normal weight it’s ok. Still angry stupid doctor recommending I’m skinny. Even think opinion matter isn’t valid, still matters. also including countries over-reporting. Yep. want people take thing seriously, safe, I'm going back old life, one able stop me. really think outbreak media wouldn’t report parents wouldn’t calling local news? can't think over. Thats states did. It’s unfortunate many Americans hate many Americans regard others lives. couldnt wait Sean Hannity get Covid see still deny it. already dismissed read article underlying conditions?  looks like high BMI callous, high risk, bringing 12-year-old home whose activities uncertain big mistake. ex-wife worried you...YOU worried you. mean, pay writers somehow. They've produced product article. used pay everything read. People got spoiled expectation everything would free internet. Mumbai better months back. main hub infection early months. I'm radiology residency pune, another city Maharashtra. Pune right cases city India almost 2,90,000 total cases whereas Mumbai sitting 2,00,000. last month pretty bad. Patients turned away hospitals. impossible get ICU bed unless know someone draw administration's attention via social media. 

My parents doctors UP. population 18 crores. huge state. Unlike places like Maharashtra Kerala less transparency data coming states like Gujarat. official data match dad hearing lot colleagues working hospitals various cities UP. Nah dude, they're supportive, they're dicks really dislike clinicians hopping trend treatments saying “something worked” using multitude options next controls. Yes it’s good treat patients share how, draw blanket conclusions like title states build citations mislead media outlets disingenuous. It’s misleading statistics improper controls anything lot research articles. viewers care. Human trials start 4 months take year more. exiting yes, right away. countries decent leadership. leader actually cares citizens. [rapidtests.org](rapidtests.org) It’s article coronavirus. Meaning get lots clicks ad revenue. That’s all.

I mean, look.... it’s top post forum 2M people surely don’t need told take CV seriously. right answer. 9% thing based study dialysis patients. 15% probably accurate. New normal when? Reduced capacity destroying business, livelihoods savings. Virtual learning destroying one even two years vital childhood education. 

It’s sustainable would need live cycles years vaccine never found. fallout worth even first year may possibly take rollout vaccine entire population. measures it. study I've read indicates already low vitamin level increase chance severity high levels work preventative. also used treatment now?  Upon search I'm immediately seeing peer reviewed studies treatment, preventative. would possible, even. ridiculous idea. can't gain herd immunity without vaccine. risky total population region. 1912 herd immunity worked great.... NOT. Yeah military suicides already high. Civilian suicides lot room climb. worst part even work. Watch Report (starring Adam Driver) look crap related it, short version waterboarding never shown provide actionable intel, torture torture's sake. No, I'm [not sure referencing - 

I love Rand Paul's ""1/3 population cross-reactive immunity"" - spitting theory fact laughed wrong man cough either. diagnosed pneumonia. Treated respect kinds antibiotics steroids. eleven days. sounds awful speculation CDC put Hypertension known factor increased risk severe illness (instead listing *might* higher risk complications)? Likely avoid panic? Per Fauci research document's I've seen HTN present 40%+ deaths. miss going bars/other outdoor social gathering spots much next person, means putting friends scenario contact COVID easily due others careless following precautions, means im still going avoid going out.

whats shown photos absolutely unacceptable. FAR reckless actions like going prolong COVID. places open follow safe guidelines make sure everyone safe ensure least risk possible. itd one thing Florida im reading seeing, seems like one cares state. selfish them. I'd highly recommend getting outdoor hobbies interacting people IRL. gonna destroy mental health try isolate stay inside winter. agree doesn’t matter, thought would clarify.  It’s ID neck lanyard. appointments people’s homes. forget appointments, make appointments don’t tell spouses etc. people really think they’re proactive “checking” too. I'll give 2 months, we're back past 10% positivity rate. I'm usually pessimistic think shutting everything indefinitely answer, Gov. DeSantis fool re-open everything 100% without mask mandate. real stupid make executive order, especially right fall season influx snowbirds / tourist season. reasons we're 5% due bar closures, local mask mandates, summer season less tourists. lives, far another massive wealth power transfer poor rich.

and death transfer, older first world, politically relevant individuals onto poor, invisible individuals third world countries. Lockdowns create hunger, unemployment, poverty, lack medical access third world countries. saving lives lockdown. making decision dies when. effectiveness lockdown depends people enforcing it. 

There people going China, mention huge amount foreign journalists diplomats. still think hide millions cases know say  country, everyone waiting flu vaccines open eyes lol. think feel responsible help government control virus. Thank you! says dangerously high used correctly. hospital one higher mortality rate compared neighboring ones told (but want irrational). area higher prevalence co-morbidities pretty cautious far remove shoes clothes get home. dined restaurant, run essential errands past 6 months. Living w/ high risk person separate bedroom bathroom MERV-10 filters house. 

Known HCW employed actually contracted (now recovered). screening employees get last heard questionnaire temp check. oh, yes I'd phone least 50% 8 hour shift. Let's say dept 10 people, phone day. Occasionally visit patient care areas/units/offices fix issues person. Employees supposed wearing mask.

I gotta get HTN control. assume ASD/developmental disabilities increase risk (per CDC) b/c lack understanding? - physiological risk? Exactly.

People think numbers suddenly drop zero. That's works. Yasiin Bey (Mos Def) video hard watch. peaked 9.6k hospitalizations currently 2.1k. almost like actual planets sick ""fuck you, got mine"" attitude people literally killing themselves. ""its flu"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Bet ya feel dumb now. already known treatment cytokine releasing issues? Primary MCAD? Mast cells known part cytokine storm, yes? seems track so. Sorry hear that!! choice colors associated plans bit ironic know everyone likes claim they're empathetic care saving lives, way basically created mental health crisis guise saving lives seems extremely selfish me. don’t really like sweets much. I’d rather eat sandwich something like cake. eat small quantities junk food feeling icky, I’d rather eat cheese nuts something somewhat healthy. 

I’ve really great meals made chefs food really good. it’s like it’s good need regular basis. Food exists things like do; it’s like putting gas car go places. Yea dealt salesclerk took mask talk. Like...that defeats whole point mask take projecting exhaust others encounter. take people them. Can’t go along plan that

Otherwise … LoL even need bit insanity simply lie whole world twerk violations. Prolly usa though, idiots Corona Virus sub glitch matrix vaccine trendy pseudo science culture starts break down.. followed Estonia reporting, know that’s blunt lie. 80-90% accuracy pretty good.. imagine pregnancy tests accuracy lol.  fantasy land, maybe. Remember happened PPE hospital workers? There's fucking chance Joe Schmoe US citizen access vaccine year, at-risk not. dropped seeing rise new daily cases. 

To attribute cases dropped massive numbers last two months protective measures adopted government: masks everywhere public private indoor spaces norm, half population using masks outdoors whenever go, masks obrigatory want use public transport. checkpoints thermal sensor lot buildings, public private ones.

 closed international airport, interestadual roads fluvial routes boats closed last month, public high schools half private ones opened last month, public middle schools still remote learning since beggining pandemic here, little kids school even now.
Also, there's international domestic tourism months tried force numbers new infections worked well. (Our first case transmitted someone traveled Italy)

We also detained sucess anti-masks/anti-lockdown protesters (althought never real lockdown Manaus), stopped months stupid thing. Parks, beachs, bars nightclubs closed long time, opened last month closed again, month places open give birth second wave. think really immunity time led decrease spread virus, looks like last much longer Also, one sane mind 160 million tests 80k confirmed cases

Maybe bit insanity get pandemic then. possible reason would someone want touch take nametag? Unless they're blind, nametag braille, somehow perfect aim. June year started saying going see ""light end tunnel"" late 2021. Everyone told pessimist. Especially already thought paranoid alarmist. hate right sometimes. Everyone boat. wealthier students afford tutors small learning pods. middle class ones half-hearted online education. lower class/impoverished students may laptops/wifi/a parent stay home, get even less. Needed too. I’m big earner we’ve lucky far, there’s definitely times it’s really hard keep grinding away everything’s normal. mental load roof, I’ve tended keep pushing forward pretending things okay nationwide. Certain states far transparent others. family uttar pradesh working radiology resident maharashtra. parents doctors well. Maharashtra kerala etc transparent data. Uttar pradesh gujarat much. Dad heard colleagues hospitals state tests intentionally delayed. One friends government office says entire staff screening. Half screened ten 60 came positive. govt delayed screening half office. Stuff like happening. 

Social media maybe. Independent press? much. mainstream media talking covid economy all. focusing certain celebrity's death since past four months. lot mainstream media diverting public attention away issues matter. obvious anyone two neurons rub together back March Awesome need rushed vaccine then. Well lot people think virus bulls\*\*\* disproportionately likely catch it, fact doubt thousands people like surprising. anyone know - much game-changer seems?

If could rolled huge amounts, surely would beat virus? 
At least, airports could massively curb spread across borders open tourism Way dodge question, troll. work can’t link, yes dozens studies linking vitamin good outcomes.  don’t know need keep daily posting every time pandemic denier gets COVID. They’re everywhere every country we’ve clearly understood world bunch idiots. 3rd leading cause death US 2020 far. That's way political subreddits went. bad sign can't tell banned something - moderator overstepped. believe got banned one called source kept using, headlines always different article, course headline always dramatic article fluff/opinion piece. everyone commented headline.

Then second one, moderator told one posts responding ""too repetitive."" Like, WTF. current event subreddits repetitive, stuff gets discussed months changes gets fixed goes away. even know mod started getting pissed me, knows, maybe banned bunch people today. Imagine banned talking covid everyday? age group majority workforce. There's lot factors, unfortunately, go including history medical experiments Black people making less willing agree participate trials. efforts, target.

If independent panels what's needed put trust process, go it, cautious make sure panel unbiased doctor agenda see data. Regardless race, think people would see opportunity agendas (demon sperm doctor comes mind). Republicans killing America 🇺🇸 🖕💩🐀 Pet stores get hamsters somewhere Washington income tax either we've taken pretty hard stance proper precautions.  Good Point Ya know countries feel like mostly direct anger goverment cases half population (US).

Sweden is....different. Swedish goverment morally reprehensiable, Swedish people aswell. pretty gross. That’s hugely optimistic view. hope you’re right there’s data immunity lasts 3 months. None. \*The lockdown original comment said deaths per capita,

It not. kind people get flu shots also kind people follow rules like wearing masks avoiding non-essential social encounters. understand people say ""The numbers higher we're testing more!""

Like, kidding - testing causing cases, detecting them. understand people try tone severity caseload saying numbers high ""because testing""... yes, we're testing more, we're showing way people infected probably initially thought. That's reason relax? Ontario alone today reported 700+ cases... far know research terms small amount time passed. simple statistics talking about. Reporting easier scientific investigation vetting since extensive, plus usually peer reviewed. Add probably additional safety protocols normally needed, proper research gets harder. think point, can't expect concrete statistics long term effects coronavirus likely still figuring are. mean time, enough doctors said cases lasting effect stories credibility, serve reminder still take seriously.
That point here. Shame death toll lockdowns restrictions, played decades, orders magnitude higher “iTs ViOlAtInG rIgHtS” source that? highly doubt know you’re talking about. Hospitals keep enough staff hand handle capacity currently at. That’s knew anyone medical industry, call nights nights called off. honestly believe hospitals aren’t prepared capacity/bed limits? calculate limits mean nothing? silly response you. baffles many pointed apologists Sweden's poor performance.

Because us lived saw response good. quick effective neighbors difference likely marginal. difference result match difference response. response would poor epidemic would peaked April. Considering low levels antibodies found May clearly nothing immunity, response. 
However outsiders tend look numbers (quite reasonably) assume response horrible. wasn’t. honest nobody really knows happened answers probably coming anytime soon. humanity would already gone extinct hundreds times. american capitalism let us put life profits.  society selfish point dont give shit. 1, 2 punch america. written principal children's school, division, claiming exemption children wear mask reasons including mental, dental, medical personal choice.

Well that's throwing everything wall hoping something sticks. PA trying jersey years. go.  Got link study? Efficacy ? Yup. Lockdowns this, virus. Ol' Chris enjoy shitting himself.... gave birth March pandemic baby. parents either overseas work “no mass transit” rule still we’ve 0 help. planned year would definitely say: sure stock diapers wipes now. start pandemic couldn’t get preferred diapers wipes while. family can’t visit whatever reason, lots facetime family friends!! little one knows grandparents are, even it’s video call. Definitely encourage go lots walks outside fresh air. mood definitely dips haven’t outside days. Meal prep healthy meals store freezer baby arrives, won’t want worrying cooking newborn. hope life better us time little one arrives. Cherish moment, take lots pictures videos, make sure rest much know you’ll wonderful parents! brigading except people like cherry pick ""covid worse disease ever"" data ignore positive developments, that's always side fall on, guess getting sick actually discuss answer questions.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOL million active cases ""no community transmission"" That's found looking data. Looking back 2017, see year still significantly happened years. Late 2017 rough flu season, 2017 still fewer overall deaths 2018 (which fewer deaths 2019).

Data available July year far (about 58% year) already deaths years overall. adds 200k excess deaths far year average three previous July. 

I find monthly data 2017, can't compare excess deaths year date that, 2014, 2015, 2016 fewer deaths 2017. fact, year year, overall deaths increased last 6 years. comparing 2019 instead average several previous years make look less dramatic, more. catch COVID19 cars nearby other? went pharmacy pick prescription. two lanes, one picking prescriptions, another COVID testing. sitting car. person lane getting tested sitting their's. wearing mask sitting alone car, roll window minute get prescription. know might seem silly, I'm anxious.

I sincerely doubt he's going start time soon, are. :( Notice added caveats original comments? wonder is. 

Anyone Covid tragedy could prevented. Herding much different socializing. Social distancing polite way telling complete morons herd like fucking idiots. live Orlando; I’ve already driven passed restaurants packed capacity, people social media posted videos completely packed clubs bars, opinion definitely accurate I’m seeing here. never really much done far pandemic response, Florida completely done  Seems ill-advised continue divide people, that’s kind got us mess. “b” capitalized nothing else (IE “Black man” “Black person” “Black doctor”), logically follows race primary prism person viewed. view people people instead everyone focusing divides us?  Look - still hope future dwindling pretty fast. surprised easy human rationalize horrible things. 

In 2016 lot faith whistleblowers - willing risk jobs reputation put light onto dark areas US govt. However...as evidenced last years, whistle-blowing proven great way correcting things much government, public degree, hostile informers. One needs look media reaction long stories live - shit even BIG NEWS items like Panama Papers died relatively fast. need look see current whistleblowers see traction gained lost. Anyhow, collective public determine important - bring back trust various public offices. Unfortunately (and major reason lot people vote) many people US struggling survive. brain bandwidth delve civic structure rolling 2 jobs living paycheck paycheck. Like none BS matters RIGHT NOW. Couple struggle lately govt officials lying straight one calling (media) disenfranchised society.  

Also fatigue. Sorry long wall text - fatigued dishonesty false patriotism bs. seen thread I've sanitized feed politics worry angst whatever reason showed up. many posts appear cringy, real fear humans ok putting product purely money betterment fellow neighbor. miss days altruistic totally suspect. 

I'm glad group doctors recognize imbalance. hope pans out.

So peace upon hold hope. technically free kinds viruses, i'm talking going back covid. happen eventually. take long time.  people think covid hoax bully pester people worried it, pressure others taking risks could harm health. articles people meeting karma reassurance spite peer pressure faced right thing, staying safe still right thing. people graduate college getting 22. straight wrong. Honestly, think right. Drinking water helping. need lay caffeine make sure I’m staying hydrated. Also daily exercise. real destroying society. crematoriums. late point. response documented. Anyone wowed vaccine point likely going vote anyway. Kinda captain obvious article real?? basically volunteering prison worse? retirees ones risk. However since Corona minuscule risk 97% survival rate highest age, they’ve realized financial ruin riskier. supporting community helping younger people keep work jobs. Welcome Florida. masks distancing required. Make home. Covid gives approval two thumbs up, well! Lol r/atethepasta Ferrets. go r/COVID19 ""scientists"" tell almost everyone already infected fine. personally get head ass change look around fat cunt. choose participate. There’s crap load apartments built upstate ny town, ya need one true, important we're unlikely see long-term shortages. Assuming even 30-40% people want vaccine all, I'd wager folks care one get. 

Getting partial herd immunity really US's shot embarrassingly demonstrated people refuse inconvenienced things like ""wearing mask"" staying fuck home. opposite that. Here's latest case/death charts New York City, running 7-day amazing brought ferocious curves down. would certainly disheartening came back like before.

NYC currently 273.57 deaths per 100k population, ranks 20th US per capita US per capita average 61.57. agree principle Fairness Doctrine, practice kinda sounds like democratic nightmare. Giving FCC power decide “fair equitable” representation news get hand quickly someone like Trump office, especially since think(?) FCC chairs appointed president. I’m wrong feel free correct that’s got Wikipedia article. Dying killing others always risk before. Nothing really changed. point life might accidentally killed someone asymptomatic flu transmission. feel that? mean, majority voted DeSantis party. feel bad them, feel bad ones voted blue. Post: ""I trust case counts""

Idiot: HOSPITALIZATIONS!!?!?!

Eat shit, really.  Sure, completely understand that. Everyone best them. mom chemo that’s definitely impact personal risk tolerance. people say ""we live life normal old people sick people stay home"" people start symptoms go public anyway. I’m low risk home gatherings, exceptions single caregiver allowed per visit.""*

This needs effect virtually everywhere world. largest vector winter holidays forced indoors. personally don’t want anything end realize even get vaccinated still great probability getting ill dying. make classic mistake modern people, think troubles world others exempt. Well good luck then. would evidence look like you? right... love big brother. Socialism selfish, magic science, capitalism love.

Quack. hate masks, praise emperor. daughter North Dakota said ton National Guard city covid testing. Vaccines also normally 140+ candidates developed simultaneously. 

There's large incentive - scientifically financially solve problem. money issue bright minds come together, things tend get solved pretty quickly. Imagine caring much harmless advice? left FL thought pertinent. MASSIVE amounts money line. there’s Thanksgiving know what’s Florida makes money taxing tourism sales tax residents . tax things like rentals terms 180 days ie vacation homes air BnBs, hotels, 5 Disney parks, lego world, sea world, universals 3 soon 4 parks. pretty heavily taxed. here's latest case/death charts Wisconsin, running 7-day spike cases. Deaths noisy plateau, interesting see curve follows increase cases. better sources. example, treatment depression researchers already shown effect several agents always exaggerated published literature - 70% (on average 30%). case agents, even doubtful whether benefit detectable all, trials 74% (3033/4098) patients data overestimated benefit reboxetine versus placebo 115% reboxetine versus SSRIs 23%, also underestimated harm.
http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c4737 people go vacation Florida shitshow continues. putting child back daycare (I'm Florida). ~~Florida Man~~ Florida Restaurant Owner. amount shit I've gotten creating r/Masks4All actually astounding. again, look creation date. created Trump made bullshit political, could never expected reality. Well thankfully people stupid, myopic uninformed are, may initially caved misinformation social pressure earlier year, sentiment opinions definitely changing, actually see forest trees point. post history incredibly strange. Almost like treat whole situation competition least deaths. don’t get downvoting shooting messenger pointless don’t think? It’s like anything offer word support people could something would. Sorry see people want vent anyone bringing bad news think it’s pointless tell people like hear.
Mask move on, prevail end. They'll make money via insider trading. likely backing anyone yet. amount shit I've gotten creating r/Masks4All actually astounding. again, look creation date. created Trump made bullshit political, could never expected reality. necessary, choice made. Others different priorities. Solution mean eradication virus. eradicated viruses yet life continues normal.

Ah see crackpot conspiracy theorist. new move new world order put us complete police state. 

Also naive make assumptions long term effects virus little data, data based hospitalised critical cases. Extrapolating tiny slither hospital cases disingenuous abd dishonest. I've seen chart already used propaganda. even added % numbers without multiplying 100 made numbera laughable. numbers seem par data though assume low IFR, around 0.6% - many places saw go way 1% though (whole Spain, whole UK example, whole NY also higher 0.6%), doubt low personally.

Example 0.6% unlikely - NY saw 0.3% population die far 50% infected. Good Spanish serological study also showed IFR higher 1% pretty thorough taking account antibodies decline time. fair, Douglas County numbers. add Sarpy/Cass county looking ~950 cases last week ~900 week. 

A UNMC doctor heard talk Corona virus said ""conservative estimates"" put actual case load high 300% higher factor asymptomatic cases never know it. 

I think non-invasive tests may help slow spread. I've probably known 10 people it, I'm adult hockey community lot people got sick played tournament recently something like half teams caught it. Thankfully sense sit summer (and winter too). wish could upvote million times more. :( even know point you’re trying prove? advice future curse words insults make appear educated. Try get wrapped feelings trying debate someone seems bring hostility inside you. Maybe that’s you’re parents handled conflict child. know pandemic difficult hope make ok. Best luck future opposed got information people Reddit? I'm sure unironic. feel like purposely ""troll libs"" getting smarter! Refusing government mind control autism drugs! Wake sheeple! 
/s  tell scientific community better include black scientists, like myself. Yeah left leaning regard hoping sounded smart head, darn. Again, keep parroting b.s. scares lazy take time try understand and/or admit refuse comprehend really stake. ""Cult""...BOO!, ""civil liberties""...BOO!, ""house arrest""...BOO! Sorry upset you, shows trying get emotional. I'll reward fragile ego say yes, fully support house arrest, long keeps away knuckleheads like you. sincere note, hope family make without much adversity. good life.  Actually flu around 0.0002 (0.02% swine flu). [The CDC trying cancel know, hard decision. Wait till get Christmas. Yeah, no. choose go, kid next kid class went Applebee's night licked booth I'm potentially paying decision. grandchild another one 'recovered' statistics. man article. barely mentions cross immunity - point possible, proven something base policy on. 

I look example Texas - opened wide up, cases skyrockets started approaching point overwhelming hospitals, rolled back openings (bars still closed Texas unless 51% food sales) mandated masks numbers plummeted several weeks. Could also read “nearly two thirds households struck Covid faced financial trouble pandemic Darn virus, causing economic damage!! destroy cursed virus. Quick! Ready vaccine! think explanation provisional subject change. Sept. 23 onward, figures daily new cases include cases already validated Ministry Health daily PDF report. Since validation process takes time complete, additional cases expected added retroactively weekly historical dataset revision released Ministry Health Friday, Oct. 2. Data Sept. 23 reflects latest release official ""Historical Series Cases Autonomous Community"" dataset released Ministry Health.*

It means last week's cases revised later upside. previous post said vaccine solution need end pandemic. Maybe mistake. restrictions likely continue while. vaccine wehre near effective people want be. restrictions come in, even monitoring surveillance od citizens order ensure economy shutdown again.Hello surveillance state. Nice see china. sure riots america countries. Yes people tolerate it. plan. never going back ""pre-covid normal"".
Also, like said worry long term damage does. deaths. millions people fuxked hearts lungs reduced fertility lot worse deaths. second wave hit?

When first wave end? never ending stream covid cases Yeah employers fault give papers, governments. so... stoked, kept job? LIKE needed BS excited want cherry one. plan touch rushed politicized vaccine I've seen people couple months in. I'm vaccinations, trust government right now. think way unspecific. whole, Germany great country great cities, interesting opportunities welcoming population.

But covid restrictions make miserable really hope change Germany find normality next year. Austrian, would love go Munich weekends per year, really like way life german cities, different rural Austria. expensive south beach restaurant work immediately filled 100% next day. shitshow felt unsafe you’re concerned covid. even larger uptick weeks. European countries logical explanation death tolls recent surge cases? 

They've months stop spread sort everything out, claim hit months ahead really excuse more. least German following orders turned good... 97% believe higher end predictions  Let interpret. I've become fluent Fauci. saying is: ""These people fucking morons."" may Jewish neighborhood it’s holidays. 

In so, You’re blaming jews you’re automatically blaming *for Jewish things*. part isn’t cool. *was

Much like doctorate need keep degree. program poor people.

It's not. program everyone. Hence lack means graduate high school 2.5 GPA,

Are deliberately harping one requirement care ~75% Louisiana high schoolers get 22 ACT? responsible everyone else like typical. I'm Florida moved back. even surprised. There's reason, aside obnoxious twat, charge telling people cannot holidays homes. Get bent. Well let people interact bit herd immunity instead dragging virus Fallout related.

If play Fallout game, sounds like beginning one Vault experiments. People think it’s super deadly get information here. Sounds French Italian words, bureaucrats would rather several million people die naturally risk dozen die experiment blamed millions deaths could easily fired dozen control. acceptable behavior beyond me. bureaucratic hurdles removed back March. Anything chance improve pandemic allowed proceed, completely ignoring dissent. shit Sudden death. Thanks, knew Chinese one. saved comment unrelated reasons. It’s already getting better... deaths slowing effective forms treatment becoming common really glass houses point, country acted fast followed sound advice. Yeah sucked, free roam streets unmasked controlled. country laughing stock world circle drain shouting ""we number one""

There’s nothing that’s quantitative worth responding to, it’s standard anti-American rhetoric. record though, I’ve always able walk street mask free, still am. 👍🏼 age bracket? pilot, also took nasal swab everyone tested dog. made comments justification described seems happening. You’re arguing anyone here. much read need need baby.  
It feels overwhelming.  
But simple fact baby far simpler realise. 
Far simpler much harder.  
Have stuff clean baby.  
Have stuff feed baby.  
Have stuff clothe baby. 
Have somewhere baby sleep safety lay day. 
Other that, love them, nurture try get sleep.  
You learn babies routine (or lack off) pretty quickly. 
Actively plan adjust routines support get sleep whenever can.  
If baby awake night acknowledge try one get good sleep day. Chinese test earlier first diagnostic test.

Btw, Charite Berlin sending test research facilities free. evil Gates Foundation paid shipping. hell going about?

Fuckin degens. fine last line, blew incivility - removal shows. Post want to, polite do. God actually imagine listening medical expert medical issue, nice feeling. Yes, modelled, 999 models wrong 1 right. know right one?  Well, one reasons. Life PRC normal now. RoK never needed lockdowns. Asians point. Saying cant excuse lazyness, cowardice indiscipline.

Your run healthcare system would collapse, even less resources F ITA wake nightmare realize starts anew short period time.

But go ahead lick doorknobs. hug family smarter everyone else. Could would should, also studies showing flu time covid significantly increase risk death. correlation getting flu vaccine getting flu less risk dying covid. damn hackers! plain stupid. understand state reps ALL. like reps damn virus. ""Oh no, totally fine."" careful many kiss want partner show big wedding Whoa! transmission vector fleas, people fleas can't transmit plague dies out. medical professional’s advice? Go home glass wine. 

This American Medical advice think I've ever heard. real truth always comments. fatality numbers pretty low though. country fantastically high fatality number diseases, even blip radar? never said unless understand place, idea. 

I've spent close 5 years travelling there. promise comparison. countless little villages right across country, many running water electricity. way they're getting correct numbers. Declaring state emergency close election bit suspect face. What's view Czech bit government vis vis corruption? smart people calling virus bullshit stay safely home. fair, he's ophthalmologist, medical doctor specializing treatment eyes. saying specialist virology means, MD, completed medical school, passed boards, Etc. Yeah, I’m much worried elderly parents wife getting seriously ill it. Thanks responses. Ok, comrade. Wisconsin entered chat. schools opened cases surged ridiculous levels. fuck you, that's why! right, much higher kill rate older population. actually similar Chinese data showed several months back. probably surprising chart also include data China. She'll fine. Thing's extremely contagious makes people think super deadly contagiousness killed many far. nothing else say ad hominems? people dying? I'll say , family's sake, holidays spent together. saying hospitalizations cases false Florida? it’s lunacy think Florida’s hospitalizations numbers fudged overwhelmed. See there? Waveception. Little early talking smack. thousands people International Drive Saturday without masks. 2nd Wave come! What's average percentage hospital beds use ""normal"" times? say hospitals businesses like keep pretty high occupancy general. Empty beds waste money. lot research contradicts right general. last study reading OC43 HKU1, exposed year year, third year 10% infected. second year already 50%.

The truth know exactly long well immunity hold. similar coronaviruses, immune response closer SARS-1 virus shares genetic data with. think safe assumption here, researchers pretty split topic. see research subs time saying reinfection unlikely, research pointing saying. near cut dry making be. Genetically coronavirus pretty far ones mentioned, much closer SARS-1. may chosen interpret short term data way, jury still much longevity SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 immunity. 

And antibodies way 100% sterilizing immunity, tcell memory mucus membranes prevent infections well. statement partially untrue. Yes, antibodies surefire way full immunity guaranteed, plenty viruses bodies learn fight immediately without existing antibodies for. Antibodies always fade, mean degree immunity remain. Sometimes difference 100% immune mostly immune.

Simple way think it: virologists never expected antibody levels fade eventually, they've split still comes long immunity lasts. Clearly antibodies infection prevention ends. even factors understand yet like immunological dark matter. Truthfully sounds like trying simplify down, that's easily done. Immune systems simple imperfect that.

If enough population infected/vaccinated drops endemic level, rarely causing severe disease, that's essentially herd immunity. Maybe ""immunity"" itself, enough herd ""resistance"" serious problem anymore. idea herd immunity taken literal here. Tr*mp person still saying go away. never going away totally, immune systems recognize virus infection vaccination, point causing severe disease much less like flu/cold, that's essentially what's desired. True herd immunity complete disappearance virus rare usually occurs long time eradication efforts effective vaccine exists. virus outright mutating dead ends itself, never really go away. 98% MMR vaccine antivax became bigger movement started seeing small outbreaks among population.

Edit: Lets forget either large part asymptomatic mild infections low viral amounts even register rapid test likely infectious. infections become mild time, chance passing becomes much lower. lot variables there, many sure answer without time passed. realize must make black/white, situation, yes antibodies guaranteed form 100% sterilizing immunity. really black white scenario. massive grey area explored. ""Well concerning me, mean, always said that, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator task force, something really need careful about,"" Fauci told ABC's ""Good Morning America, ""because you’re dealing community spread, kind congregate setting people get together, particularly without masks, you’re really asking trouble. Now’s time actually double bit, don’t mean close.""

I'd say ""cryptic"" generous description statements like these. That’s good. far wife fever all. mild head cold symptoms. Congrats! immune finally enjoy life normally dog reads body language handler flags anyone handler thinks suspicious. way 'drug' dogs work. even seen classic ""October surprise"" yet. live Germany tell you, miserable. people making things harder everyone. keep mask keep distance, leave information, visit restaurant bar stay quarantine advised, pre-covid life back weeks. idiots think, keep spreading virus. That's can't go back normal. 1st wave end? Indian government admitted, data available COVID cases death among 450+ million migrant workers. 1/3 population suspected high infection rate death rate counted official numbers. confirmed elderly seem give smallest fuck masks distancing first place experience. Maskholes. think comparing apples oranges. tests rolled antigen tests, antibody tests. doesn’t sound real me. You’re spraying molecule nose somehow bolsters immune system manner respiratory viruses? No, I'm suggesting keeping kids school (which Fauci wishy-washy best) lead stunted growth children. put blame ex-wife made reckless decision go large public gathering know cases high increasing. ex-wife also high risk (compromised immune system) may sealed fate there. 

The alternative would seeing son person 18-24 months best. Calculated risk like anything else, course blame inevitably belongs me. asshole. Lol everyone saying wow sub hates florida going literal idiots. 1)this Sunday numbers always low, 2) testing capacity dogshit month half now. Like people jump “oh sub hates good news bandwagon” first piece information that, surface, conforms belief. Florida bad summer, interference make better, bars/restaurants fully opening. Like use logic u inbred fucks. One day positive news tell story. Freedumb Fighters high risk people still huge chances developing severe fever, personally know many bad he's position power. job task force give formal guidance instead TV interview? WI. 81% hospital beds (statewide) Teenagers generally agency/autonomy movement, mention larger social circles, makes sense. comment removed? pre-approved source? believe mistake

EDIT, link message mods broken People need stop thinking way. won’t personally benefit doesn’t mean it’s right thing do. exactly asians right about? lock everyone home? Nah, wouldnt work anywhere else. collective oriented, euroatlantic civilisation individualistic.

I also honestly doubt Babis idea whats doing. motivated poll numbers would like herd immunity would give votes, would go it. looked like covid votes could acquired giving money pensioners instead test trace infrastructure, didnt hesitate moment.

Not going unwittingly kept course wave would november. exponential growth nombers suggest exactly that... sell vaccine let inject yourself.  people hope, blind, dogmatic faith. You’re insane lol Medications work differently different racial groups due differences genes DNA. instance, lot Black women breast cancer respond well common breast cancer treatments often get worse version breast cancer. degree epidemiology biostatistics. professor university actually lot research breast cancer Black women.

So answer question, yes. Medications respond differently. must remember African-Americans primarily mixed race heritage. treatments work purely African purely White-Americans work African-Americans admixture. Obsession fomites surface spreading absurd. I’m board empirical evidence I’m firmly camp panics surface spreading always immediately go photo. man overweight. That’s health issue. understand parents upset. 2 year old, 4 year old, 11 year old step son ZERO complaints wearing mask. guarantee kid upset wearing school upset parents constantly shit talk idea put heads sucks wear one. Like blows mind 2 year old happily wears mask go yet full grown adults temper tantrums it. 4 year old wears school never complained resisted. actually like pictures them. like fun accessory eyes. stable genius told children “almost immune”. Cases going NJ. 4 days 650+ course do. That's they're developing vaccines despite low case count. I'll always upvote reference Al Franken's greatest creation.

Older generations never taught team players. know act greater good. makes sense, explain us X-ers Millennials, Y's seeing Boomers do. still favorite instance right wing hack predictably completely wrong COVID-19 brains process button aligns narrative one feeds validation seeking behaviour more. Vaccines black rights. press button 1 I'm racist press button 2 I'm anti-vax. conundrum. pick science hijacked politics ethics hijacked politics? Help! It’s boost morale everyone taking virus seriously. helps show they’re helping lead negative consequences. ""Affirmative Action"" okay white folks. Generally speaking, see country's infection numbers soar high, ""lock"" certain value coming days, country likely hitting testing cap. could India's numbers currently capping 100k/d. shame missing something important you. shame virus killed million people already. pretty sad, prospect death outweighs frustration lack socialization. Sorry called upon make sacrifice volunteer for. agree difficult. 1. successfully prevented hospitals overwhelmed
2. need continue whenever open everything infections rise
3. think reason lift restrictions? also absurd suggest countries done little better. majority countries done lot slow spread.

Swedens response fairly unique. characterization response gone media super misleading. paper link reddit analyzing media reported response many inaccuracies.

According paper Swedens approach one seeking heard immunity. dangerous suggest politicians media outlets do. soft touch approach complex given credit many variables make increasingly hard replicate experience.

Many states taking soft touch approach seen horrible outbreak US. one look Florida, Texas Arizona. New Yorks first wave result unchecked spread March prior real knowledge level covid infection. Since put place policies gotten large wave infection remained control. Showing evidence measures effective. Much time needed see policies working versus help may getting high regional infection rate.

There data yet suggest less plenty data suggest ignore basic distancing policies keeping business open harmful.  This. fucking love man's face Look actual data, simply harvesting effect. people dying ones would've died heart disease stroke year. also see multiple times tv..”I didn’t take seriously (fill blank) suffered horrific death without comfort single person loved taking COVID seriously. Seriously...fuck people. probably ones infect (fill blank). Right. people think “healthy” reality far fit. What's active ingredient? LOL, thing wrong movie said would take 500 years get there. Seems like we're coming landing one I'm gone. OLD Hes right wing troll, check post history. There's actually whole formula VA. Every disability given rating summed using remaining marginal values left come total disability rating.

Lots benefits tied rating state federal level (above X% receive benefit.) promote encouraging people engage activity recklessly spreads disease kills 0.7% correct standard approach, need acknowledge would happen standard approach applied standard, would million+ dead. make murderer. That's false dichotomy. makes selfish sociopathic asshole doesnt deserve platform spread garbage. Nope. left ICU 10 years couldn’t watch people die, leave work realize one cared. unit lost 40% staff couple months, talking friends hospitals it’s elsewhere. fun short staffed units full baby nurses. actual news stuff (like local Fox affiliates) often pretty reasonable. They've completely utterly blurred line news content entertainment content think people realize difference. wish required make difference clear call Fox TV unless actual news programming. know I’d willing test out, fear needles would love something like become available No, no, no.... *informed.*

/s This. Learn actual portion recognize you’re hungry anymore, waiting you’re full brim.

Especially America, it’s shocking huge portions start aware it. sister school psychologist elementary school. feel bad trying help kids autistic disabilities get help need. 

First all, teachers worked well done EVERYTHING could accommodate students situation district voted for. Since beginning summer, old people district decided school. Teachers scared crying, worked summer figure teach safely. 

And week opened district said due new regulations put forth (by CDC? can't remember sorry. I'm Illinois) open without breaking them.

So remote parents blaming TEACHERS saying want work. fucking kidding?! sister teachers worked ragged teach kids give need, parents threatening sue? love sister. putting EVERY piece job right drains health. Ironically longer parents watched Fox News fewer real social interactions have. 

They've alienated lot life long friends. kids hardly ever call visit. longer watch Fox News smaller sadder world gets. Also cytokines storm theory. There’s concrete proof actually thing. think so. part problem. Exactly. Using study dialysis patients inherent bias looking population older, sedentary likely preconditions type people would likely sheltering place. study essentially worthless beyond confirmation bias wanted see. People die everyday, heart disease, stroke, etc. energy that. fact legitimately actual healthy people dying this. water boarding 16 seconds thought going die.

Not that, PTSD it, talks nightmares fear able breathe anything even slightly strenuous.  strawnman game needs work. 

I’d say “abandonment“ odds? might one dumbest posts I've ever read. Pro \*State-Forced Birth peaked 9.6k hospitalizations currently 2.1k.

So.... flattened curve like supposed to? Blame Reagan away [Fairness Everything broken news reporting traced back act. It’s anti-mask narcissism. it, listen. still miss him.

Tbf isnt common virus mutates deadly variant like Spanish Flu did. likley Spanish Flu able unique situation brought WW1. 

Basically peace time generally benaficical virus evolve becoming less deadly. super deadly, and/or makes bed ridden sick ass hell cant spread well cases kinda naturally isolate. Indeed virus spreads effectivly everyone would get like, caugh.

In war zones situation reversed, get sick sent sack home, caugh stay battlefield. ... mean years openly admitting travel bans weren’t reasons claiming courts, people skeptical claims enacting travel ban?

Lockdowns well documented throughout Spanish Flu alone. Many others, Polio, Measles, Smallpox. Quarantine common throughout don’t really anything worthwhile show it

Millions lives saved? Trump said lockdown “the right thing do, saved millions lives it.” Yeah going vaccines going places. worry vaccine doses poisoned whatever insane bullshit believe. first symptom pounding sensation asshole would anyone want fake high risk go whole show precautions?!

I can't say sure I've seen cultural shift couple blogs things used read. feel like people want general sense purpose one, look reason stand get attention, try victim. one popular blog used love got overrun people commenting stuff vein. self-diagnose mental illnesses use reason things want intention anyways. 

As per covid, well, people upvote sorts posts send praise/wishes people, maybe way people feel connected. Also, people (rightfully) hated low-paying job want go back work. BEA (Bureau Labor Statistics) link provides official government figures. need divide whatever number provide 4 get quarterly figure. Encouraging spread dangerously deadly disease? Yeah thats murder book. many idiots wearing wrong, nose, chin, hanging one ear. think getting away something? Fwiw, I’m healthcare, surrounded covid since first week march, haven’t caught it, it’s highly unlikely relative minimal contact, people overly cautious live. good thing, see negative effects people too. immediate family that’s bit neurotic terrified anything, still. people catch get sniffles. portion unlucky, sure hope isn’t it’s virus, aren’t going beat it, especially way Americans behave. Gotta cross fingers hope you’re one good ones. Take precautions. work people aren’t, go buy n95s. It’s like work room deathly ill covid patients coughing you. doh taking workplace violations pretty serious, report workplaces violating.  Thank sir Pathetic. People putting health others name tradition. ashamed. guess amounts “it’s worth even ONE person changes mind!”

Same shit, different day. people trying reach never read this. always ask...exactly many people die start caring??? Crickets.. guy clearly overweight, call healthy pre-existing conditions unintentionally hilarious headline. Well could shut world virus, late Herd immunity 100% viable solution people gotta stop fooling Life expectancy India 69 years, lower average deaths Covid deaths. Half population 27. probably get bad bad places since age huge factors Covid deaths, India really really young population. restrictions direction could go

I know could believe first disease history we've implemented kinds restrictions--and really anything worthwhile show it. correct, stop bus traffic article written. Well spotted, glad read article.

However, let's compare apples apples. 

Sweden compared neighbours, Norway, Finland Denmark. 

The Swedish authorities many times proclaimed neighbours underwent lockdown.

 mention, lockdowns hardly comparable terrible situations south Europe. lol 🙄

However, due policies, Sweden's neighbours suffered magnitude less death.

And record, Danish numbers started spiking weeks opened border Sweden again. Shame.

I sorry Swedish CONSTITUTION forbids missing dinner. hang hours still itching nuance. here's fucking chance Joe Schmoe US citizen access vaccine year, at-risk not.

Nobody ever said regular people would access vaccine year point. optimistic always Spring/Summer 2021. first round would always going medical professionals Ever since told kid ""dog trainer"" career I've proven wrong again. experts 100%, still pretty confident numbers accurate deaths inflated.

How prove point? Like.. all? think fair say nobody wants ""continuous lockdown"". people probably referring would preferred 10 week strict lockdown March followed aggressive testing contact tracing continuing month long restrictions, infection waves general episodes suffering US experiencing now. Montana (and rural parts US) benefit low pop density, wonder benefit negated anti-mask tendencies (if outright pandemic denialism) suspect rampant rural areas Jesus Christ, dude. can’t possibly dense. It’s study-it analysis data. pointing facts, wish pretend COVID hoax threat anyone. died going die anyways got sick, well healthy begin with. See easy dismiss facts face reality?

Spare us rationalizations. like wealthier. got large group monkeys it. results expected within century. advocating lockdowns. saying anybody thinks vaccine silver bullet deluded hasnt paying attention. Sorry bud, us reason MSM kept using phrase ""the new normal"". virus stay. want lockdowns, also want people messed immune systems millions people willl suffer long-term health conditions.

There reason fda lowered standards vaccines effectiveness. Surely dont spell out.

The long-term damage virus concerns me. Look long haulers saying virus, go covid19 positive hear experiences.

Also, virus may damage mens fertility. need study lot more.

But really parents 60s actually said that. Fox News thing house. Six months away doubling time we've living restrictions--which already horrible impact people's income, mental health, schooling kids, etc. want double that. can't afford to? ok, sure, whatever....in 2-4 weeks hospitalization increases obvious hell, Lace another 7 poison permanently damage kidneys lungs.

Could show source percentage along 'permanent' part? That's sort rich, given one claiming we've always handled things. 

And said, pretty clear. We've quarantined *the sick*, everyone. vaccine companies actually paid black participants trials, problem. cheap fork $$$ testing black lives.

Vaccine companies keep virtue signalling inclusive company though. 150 crew contact corona virus first post-lockdown cruise 0-19 years: 0.00002
20-49 years: 0.00007
50-69 years: 0.0025
70+ years: 0.028

This got link, unless wrong data mean highest fatality rate 2.8% that's people age 70? data understanding right, anyone 70 - unless preexisting conditions, nearly non existent chance dying it? Why? None vaccine makers taking guidance actual phases trials federal government. 

And white. overrepresented trial groups people understanding science college educations likely sign trials. groups white Asian.

Lifting restrictions mask-wearing going increase death toll. Let ask way: many dead Americans think acceptable wear masks anymore? 200.000 deaths U.S. already one highest death tolls (per million ppl). example compare 10.000 deaths Germany (which \~1/4 population U.S.). Would okay another 100.000 covid deaths, need wear mask socially distance anymore? draw line? Yeah. 2020. I'm scared what's next.

I want everyone respect science again. Please. prefers fucking pornstars daughters. That’s hot take, John Doe. suggest take medical data experts. Good. Fox News REAL FAKE news. Younger years go slow. you’re 40 trip 40 80 hella faster doubt people countries actually know what's happening despite free media ok. Science hope porn. sort stuff got posted time reddit COVID, HIV cures, nothing ever came fruition. nasal spray exist ever, best, 2022. dumb argument it’s like turning people away. can’t force people get tested. never single instance mass quarantine entire population, including young healthy, pandemic history, let alone one 0.3% fatality rate near completely harmless majority. one.

We Spanish Flu, '57 '68 flu pandemics, Swine flu. even lock entire population bubonic plague.

This obvious, common sense knowledge anyone 2+ neurons [scientific literature clear advising mass Quarantine Measures  historical observations scientific studies support confinement quarantine groups possibly infected people extended periods order slow spread influenza. World Health Organization (WHO) Writing Group, reviewing literature considering contemporary international experience, concluded “forced isolation quarantine ineffective impractical.”2 Despite recommendation experts, mandatory large-scale quarantine continues considered option authorities government officials.

Asking friend likes Pizza... numbers start decreasing suddenly data becomes suspect?

Welcome r/Coronavirus. bad news obviously true accurate OMG WTF WE'RE GONNA DIE, good news definitely false and/or government coverup.

That time July CDC took hospitalization data US perfect example. like thousand-comment thread disaster government clearly going manipulate data we're gonna die. following weeks, hundreds highly-upvoted posts place cases declining white house took data reporting (which patently false along, since never took CASE data). month later, hospitalization data went back reported directly CDC, like before. top voted comments day that's somehow still bad thing. incredible hilarious. imagine so. Weve conditioned since schoolhood look faults countries justify actions course. always cost/benefit relationship mitigation’s. black white issue.

Edit: look, know you’re tryna gotcha moment argument you’re make really relevant. Lol late, trust ""everything OK"" shortages flour yeast March Michigan, already hoarding food. Anyone wants get tested get test here. hospitals overwhelmed moment. shit paying $3 per mask? don’t even know say that. I’m surprised given today’s attention seeking society popularity google diagnosis, wow. That’s depressing. I’m vocal since shapes perception handle quarantine, try hide IRL friends even lot family. hate sympathy weird reactions come telling people health issues, already cost relationship start quarantine since can’t go like before. Pre-covid conditions sucked were/are completely manageable, whole “high risk” thing game changer life blows! Thanks sharing this, enlightening. true. overall actual *fatality* rate probably around .5%, yeah. However, many people end sick—a decent number end sick enough hospitalized—and left long-term complications. I’m NYC several friends early on. 40s healthy, recovered, bad time it. Speaking myself, idea enduring weeks severe muscle pain (think flu worse) plus feeling trying breathe straw anvil sitting chest—all whole wondering get worse, requiring go ER—sounds like something I’d really prefer avoid. Also, don’t want play part spreading thing, given contagious nature exponential growth. wondering pop lol. Yes, wrong, I'm OK that. disaster better disaster. According wikipedia school system around 5600 students. Add teachers administration probably still well 13,000 people yeah, whole school district could Quarantine sick people, sure. 

Not isolation everyone, ill not. say ideal handling, pretend we've always done. testing though... couple positives caught traveled internationally.

Closing schools everyone isn’t solution address situations. lockdown sure worse effect mental health virus itself. Unless get virus seriously ill know someone died (which rare occurrence), average person doesn’t think virus much. Life goes on- work, school, &amp; leisure.

On hand, lockdown severely crippled mental health. People worried whether government order employer close lose job. annoyed disruptions travel. Entertainment sports cut entirely. Going party frowned upon even criminal areas. things due lockdown, virus. Sweden implemented minimal restrictions fine virus.  triggered I'm bar wearing mask. going die? equal others inevitable though. NZ crushed second wave middle winter much faster first wave summer. also much weaker flu season despite fact first two months winter Covid eliminated social distancing restrictions all. Australia largely Victoria managed contain massive outbreak middle winter.  Yes 🤪🦠  Seems care anyone else one non-story. read... way bottom... two week quarantine anyone entering. Well governor suspend fines wearing mask state. sending message don’t wear anymore.

That said, still wear one public. Ah okay, thanks answering! 
Yeap ik xD got auto immuno disease nyself. Well two @-@ plus fibro bunch stuff. I'm really reluctant get vaccine time without ideal either. Probably ask dr what's best. Packing bars pandemic isn’t illegal. Probably worse. Military people covid experience similar lot “essential workers” still show person employer well known taking kind thing seriously. 

Useful article military fairly good collecting data. could extrapolate trend assume probably applies well rest society. Unluckily you, stupid people community definitely going Florida vacation going back. state regulations preschool. normal classroom sizes 12 16 depending age kids. never 3 feet apart. play yell others faces...there point arbitrarily making walk apart hall lol Except schools aren’t ready Ah, sub overrun anti-maskers.

Personally, like able hide half ugly-ass face keep breathing pound ragweed pollen whenever step outside. Yea, time they're sick dead, DeSantis's problem anymore. Delhi definitely second wave. coincides flu season. talking about.. love Fox news.. one go without bs.. CBS worst. LevyMevy implies going wear mask Halloween 2021ish, correct comment states majority population vaccinated, done. would prefer people continue wear masks CDC says safe longer wear masks. Frankly, issue LevyMevy’s timeline long it’s consistent CDC, well could be.

My specific comment concern using term “There’s limit much life I’m willing give up” regards distancing wearing mask, things could literally kill others like me. said original comment, seems like poor choice words. favorite quote last time Disneyland reopening came ""the Mouse demands sacrifice"".  point seems pretty obvious choice Baphomet Democrat, they'd happily vote Baphomet let Tucker Carlson give reasonings good Christian President Baphomet makes.  Florida way. lower standards, degree mean nothing.

Ability pay college ""standard.""

Nor really entrance requirements. kid needing complete additional Trig Pre-Calc class competing current requirements nothing cheapen degree.

Sure, college everyone, high school outcomes strongly tied socioeconomic standing, high school outcomes something im willing put much weight determining college for. I'm sure seen fair share high GPAs ACT scores fail graduate college. know have. Henrietta Lacks. Bars, Clubs, Events, Concerts, even proper weddings stuff like never even remotely work mask mandates. this, tourism also suffer greatly. speak mental health. average guy gal shut redditor, person social needs simply compatible permanent social distancing.

For example, know, sexuality.

Also, carcrashes high impact speed generally dont 99 percent survival chance. whoa thats good... Tuskegee syphilis incident, wholeheartedly understand. 6 7 weeks maybe approval one? Add another 6-7 top mass distribution. Add another 3-4 top peak antibody production booster shot depending vaccine. There’s reason health experts saying mid/late 2021. Shit takes time bruddah  Fox allowed go around crying dangers leftist ""media"" like they're manipulative full false narratives themselves? God hate Fox ""News."" Thanks tearig family apart. 9 months normal people never said believed I’m saying politicians say something seen promise. God dense. isn’t second grade telling lie doesn‘t count fingers crossed didn’t ”promise,” nice try. way tell Trump lying watching mouth. lips moving, he’s lying. one u seem suggest thats brilliant double edge situation, needs put books I’m distracting anything, like postulating question forces individuals rationalize position.

You don’t need information know locking sick people elderly folks going increase death. Lul. would opposite ever prove true?...

Under line reasoning, could easily make argument DeSantis. give break That's simply wrong. backed assertion facts, prove wrong. According [US Census 2019 US 76.3% White 13.5% foreign born. 

According [2018 NZ New Zealand 71.7% White 28.3% foreign born. 

So NZ twice proportion immigrants share populace US. also 15% Asian, compared 6% Asian US. 25% Maori Pacific Islander, US 1.5% Native American Pacific Islanders combined. 

I grew US immigrated NZ. question NZ diverse. reason would doubt pure ignorance arrogance takes claim without checking stats. said 2 million issues. agree complications caused virus. issues. believe every statement modern day politican implied promise, im afraid obtuse one Sad hear this, favorite among models. Clear data, easy navigate, transparent sources, accurate. Well thanks bud! Positive vibes too! ;)  *The worsened mental health crisis due lockdowns virus typically harm people helping spreading it. may detect certain defect genes that’s knows damage them.

Remember else viruses want spread. Segregated vaccines? shit like happen anymore stupid lying asshole? That's made hypothetical present though Fauci would seriously proclaim point. Fauci never decided made policies power, dumbass, neither ever intended thing stated numerous times. ever made suggestions combat pandemic actual policy makers decide upon never US' current policy makers ruling administration bunch fascists bending corporate overlords voters order maintain power.

""But pre-existing underlying conditions numbers high really bad."" - stepmother Part issue Fed dumping huge quantities money economy everyone saving money. saving instruments inflated. really hope case degree they'd ignore data showed safe. trust someone knew that, they'd go ""whistleblower"". 

I agree time, it'd end pretty corrupted, regulatory capture would certainly make worse. endorsed US Rep Ralph Norman - SC. opened introduced doctors beginning video. mean fuck? Shouldnt motherfucker resign? Gross. TLDR: Far worse US.

Sorry details want praised laziness following rules necessary officials aka human beings ones this.

*because* covid, no?

The answer yes, FYI. People magic restrictions reason. Apparently Kiwis lol Schools great setup superspreader events, infecting many households once. kids' cases may mild parents' grandparents' worse. also ask immediate halt pandemic it? India's cases rising testing ever before. According Indian government, community transmission virus. things bad numbers make be. Ah yes go optometrist understanding viruses time. Sadly, difference lost virus. care. can’t really charging 300k IND. people love patriotic, sure don’t seem want least protect fellow Americans. Brave bold? No, fucking stupid. Fact.

I'm sorry what?

General population also seat belts, guess long term solution.

""Because people want to"" might stupidest fucking argument I've heard trying combat deadly virus. Nice, tell Uyghurs China.

Florida probably won't.

I've Austin snow. even get north Texas, Lubbock north.

20 California's 58 counties usually get snow winter, half dozen counties often get snow highest elevations.

In big cities? Every while, highest points metro Los Angeles get snow. Dallas-Fort Worth Austin get snow, may last long.

I expect winter relatively kind 1/3 US population southern tier states, bordering Mexico Gulf, regard COVID. OTOH, states north 2/3 US population likely get hit hard. them, depends area. enjoyed deaths associated that. matters conservatives. embracement death. Go team! Let’s pretend factors decision 99% people please. wearing masks makes whole branches economy unable work, general population much long term mask mandates. read article lol Thinking lot passage terrible US healthcare system Lastly, Moderna’s Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccines require two doses per person time, second dose come manufacturer first dose. also administered exactly 28 days, Moderna’s, 21 days, Pfizer BioNTech’s, first dose—in cases longer vaccines stored fridge. means right number vaccines right people require extensive careful record keeping. hell. daily cases exploding. actively trying make worse. would anyone that?  want black panel doctors making sure vaccine stamp approval assuring trust people need it?

Well, worst case group may accidentally discourage blacks participating trials ""Not trusting FDA"" type headlines, trials continue under-representation blacks, panel reviews data declares vaccine unsafe blacks, blacks take vaccine, continue COVID deaths well availability others.


My reading article intend review results trials; taking action encourage increased minority participation trials help ensure thorough testing. 6 7 weeks governor one thing. certain extent expect degree stupidity political figures due little thing called politics.

What shocks people actually stuff bars restaurants drink party covid. Like universe could possibly think good idea, bring shit home family? words.  good bad news? also know real numbers back wave 1. Things might worse now. probably never know. Hug Asian campaign  Looking you, Tesla agree whole heartedly science! work couldnt really read said contextually thanks laying out.. see mean. wouldnt easier stop spread since period takes get sick well virus sheds first days infection relatively less.. meaning could isolate.. get flu like H7N9 (a novel strain) potential spread less lockdown situation vs covid. severely deadly would virus even chance spread like pandemic? dont think so. 

The scenario laid could scary far novel flu viruses relatively contained spread. ethnic groups designated proper nouns capitalized. Therefore, use “Black” “White” instead “black” “white” (do use colors refer human groups; considered pejorative). Likewise, capitalize terms “Native American,” “Hispanic,” on.

It's recent [APA style Wrong. Millions U.S. die contagious infectious respiratory virus every 12-18 months. would surprise me, don’t really allow mentally unstable people mods usually. weird seem know history. even first time pharma rushed vaccine made bad batch first time corporation willingly allowed deaths profits first shot federal contract.

It often comes average IQ smart fraction. need condescending. understood point perfectly. seems confused. Pretty well actually. PrEP stop spread slew antiretrovirals, HIV much less threat days. Unfortunately expect you’ll swamped deniers Florida open anywhere US much, much open places.

People “just want live life normal again” surging way, given don’t believe Covid, bring them.  combination Victoria's existing lockdown. expected see relaxation lockdown measures new cases low recently. Considering reluctant go back stage two, think it’s going blow :( wrong? Many dont too. Like husband others knows. People military come different places backgrounds different opinions like rest us. opinion ones support Trump stupid dont know vote best interests. inflated military budget doesnt go members military. paid crap, supplies suck, food crap, uniforms nowhere near good quality parents  Localization meaningful long people travel mix. reason whole world needs get vaccine based immunity. 100% worldwide population infected 0.6 IFR 42million people die. potential long term brain heart damage could cripple hundreds millions more.

It could far worse, super serious.

America gets fate deserves. Australia. 5 cases yesterday. Masks + usual prevention measures work. deal another six months Jan 1 approved vaccine distribution.

I understand point beginning 2 week Duration would Major impact. also would possible really easy. rate would reach herd immunity november, so...

Funny thing tho, old MoH wanted measures enacted much sooner, prime minister decided it, afraid negative PR. result shitshow nobody trusts word say everyone looking way go around measures, ""Bastards playing another PR game"" Correct answer. question bait expected OP make answer America-centric blame leaders US. That's problem using incomplete data make big decisions.  Peoples lives line using right data.

I'm surprised can't see that. I’m surprised one mentioned Florida’s governor saying expects hold Super Bowl Miami February. evidence current administration influenced flu shot? why? Something miraculous otherwise =/= promise. 



Get clue no, Italy closed travels China came Germany could search /r/coronavirus articles point causation, correlation Exactly. Black Americans right skeptical government's vaccines they've used virus/bacteria guinea pigs century. not? There's literally downside mask. NONE. see wear perpetuity. often refuse participate due paranoia, paranoia shown article. Science hope porn.

Archive link- scroll large timeline graphic doesn’t appear archive - looks like black page[archive link anyone trouble accessing article Hmm... least govt stopped playing charade made right guy MoH. Imagine dragged feet december. people military never kill anyone. There's way jobs infantry. husband engineer National Guard. help natural disasters mostly. general even pissed conservatives making BLM covid helped transport medical personnel supplies helped testing facilities handing food water income. parents army. job band. Literally job. job play parades, events, funerals. I've known many people military including family members one ever killed anyone. 


There's also fact many people join military due poverty. military offers free housing, free college, free health insurance, free training. see way out. Lots minorities too. Many join order become citizen US hopes better life family. Anything done overseas ordered. desensitized training dehumanized. Blame government happens, soldiers. victims too. think kill large rate? ones actual warzones see fucked shit want part of. suffer PTSD. pawns government. course there's gonna psycho enjoys it, I've yet meet one. mutations show primarily groups certain geological areas, sickle cell anemia prevalent African countries.

Jewish holidays aren’t even over. literally began 9 days ago - go Sunday 9th, two weeks. whole holiday period 3 weeks even halfway through.

That wasn’t it. problem lies taking government bail money. government affairs businesses, although way starting way back progressive era around 1910. It’s one reasons companies massive, like Amazon Apple. products centralization power. 

So agree effective lockdown strict regulation would helpful case like Australia. would hesitant allow US gov’t exercise power, giving ability lock house much longer lasting tyrannical effect COVID ever will. Although admit base opinions government judgements important. case, I’m willing COVID spread, don’t think nearly deadly first thought, prevents us centralizing government powers even further.

Sorry, resist went point beautifully situation millions people died. innocent souls mean anything you?

You'd think would easy understand half year pandemic that's killed million people. laughable people see 'post lockdown' assume whole pandemic over. Morons. Haha same, got tested weeks bad right went doctor.

Overall think continuing share negative reactions stuff important. IMO kind supporting ""Us vs Them"" mentality constantly trying drive rifts Fauci's advice country actually doing. words, lazer-focused negativity Dr. Fauci (an individual) expresses, make easier Corona-Doubters cast issue political divide rather policy divide.

I'd much prefer titled headline, ""Leading Experts Strongly Disagree FL Decision re-open bars restaurants full capacity"" something leave matter POLITICAL.

One, pre-COVID infection data deal with, unknown COVID-19 actually *caused* abnormal heart images. issue get people nonhospitalized, younger, and/or asymptomatic, null hypothesis would plausible groups would see cardiac damage, especially asymptomatic. mean possible? Absolutely not. could possible, can't conclude that.

Second, 67% cohort displayed cardiac damage, good idea extrapolate number general population cohort share characteristics general population. also generally good practice extrapolate general population usually stats unless good representative sample.

The points made trash study anything like that. idea behind study say ""Hey could issue, lets look further."" study, however, say ""People getting cardiac damage despite sometimes asymptomatic, young, nonhospitalized. Everyone needs go see cardiologist ASAP."" said, respect myocarditis, bad idea see cardiologist (it's always good see doctors concerned), especially athlete push limit likely see complications related myocarditis. average human, however, unlikely see symptoms myocarditis heal fine.

Rand Paul suggested maybe New York well immunity risen due horrible first wave. stated level heard immunity. Effectively implying many lock policies unecessary.

Fauci believe entirely incorrect suggest 22% estimated prevalence could suggest immunity current results must due policies. new vaccines probably even expensive.

The listed pricing vaccines available time now. None like $40. Ding ding ding. hit nail head. disagree premise high infection rates necessitate broad lockdown restrictions first place. Frankly, article posted anecdotal evidence doesnt post hard statistics like NYT report underreporting Can't wait hear lot people would love nothing see huge numbers Florida. Smh I'd finding new job fast  Ok...no one Florida allowed leave state. Keep shit yourselves. Lockdown restrictions direction could go, pretending could done anything else disingenuous. like pretending won’t second lockdowns. Yeah, like AIDS initially appears totally harmless without symptoms. year suddenly get strange infections.  need math PSAs explaining concepts like exponential growth, orders magnitude, 1-3% chance death *very fucking bad*. Don’t put evil rasslin Probably restrictions. don’t think strict parts Italy, deaths reach level due improved treatment. certainly isnt. also unreasonable someone want get data favorable toward authorization. I'm saying fears face clear data limit ability want get it, get it. recent Covid study showed people coughed infectious people not, infected 13.6% close contacts, compared 3.0% non-coughing group. suggest people flu-like symptoms would better spreaders people asymptomatic. severity also matter. Asymptomatic patients infected 0.3% close contacts. Mildly symptomatic people infected 3.3% them, moderately symptomatic's 5.6%, 6.2% severe critical cases. Vermont 🍁 places competent government, lead people leading normal lives summer (most Europe). angry people wearing masks, people responsible continued restrictions due high infection rates. morality play.

Point laugh Southern states, people going bars, teenagers partying, Covid deniers getting sick. allows people sort psychologically feel better people getting sick “deserve to” without really addressing bigger issues play.

We saw AIDS, saw opiod epidemic, fuck saw Black Death lol (witches! Omg!) mean kinda like bad flu. kill people too. think anyone saying words flu. I'd rather give birth pain meds again. Funny goes ways though, seen MANY Florida plates north summer. Go back Florida, plague rats! It’s like sense urgency virus. There’s enough volunteers would willing start testing immediately, yet trials won’t start 4 months. thought full shutdown, local paper said, besides times people catch something else So... exactly think study then? I’m confused guy. incredibly horrifying - lengths people go defend beliefs it’s logical thought reason, putting people risk. Lowest low - offence. supplements take? Might rate, deficient, terrible healthcare despite powerful country world something would expect American voters want politicians address. someone blames Trump hillbilly republicans, USA several democrat governments states, actually richest ones, democrat governors since ever.

I sure money least good Sweden exists I’m disagreeing you. would however bet money fact Make US AKs Great would able answer question Tuskegee experiment Jeopardy Probably alcoholic borderline diabetic, still Honestly, point matter. NEED STOP VIRUS. Would rather poor despot dead? Yes, reports like seem confirm ibd?  people know love start dying... getting sick care right? matter time...? Eh, cultural anything think. Swedes waaaay used ""good"" country get super defensive opposite proven.

The Swedish goverment years breeding attitude like yes, brainwashing thing ""troll factory"" thing. tell me. point exact statements post false, not? experts say no, deaths inflated

They say no. said think are. (･o･;) I've heard reports going ways, many workers ground indeed reporting sharp spike death rate lot difficulty dealing it, said obviously exclusive India, New York, Texas Florida attest to. One doctors paraded around touting HQC believes ailments caused sex demons. kidding Texas income tax haven’t seen used reason open bars. Gosh! Thank this!!! It’s cringetastic! many media's posterchild NY NJ have, per capita? Man didn’t accuse nothing challenging opinion don’t take personally told you, like answer? think understand lol

Yes, spreads medical facilities, that's beside point: millions people getting vaccine going slow spread virus. every day impact felt more.

It's like we're going huge spikes day 250th million person vaccinated suddenly take masks go baseball game. TBH media &amp; government largely blame rapid spread Coronavirus world wide.

I looking old advertisements YouTube AIDS back 80s. basically grim reaper lining group humans bowling alley like pins, rolling bowling ball knocking deaths. I’m sure would’ve created air fear community back then.

Nowadays advertisements Covid, government private sector promoting themselves, soft gooey messages “we together” &amp; “be kind one another”. doesn’t exactly paint virus dangerous enemy.

IMO should’ve focus long term health consequences body. 

Supposedly even young survive, impact organs years come quite damaging. People report lung functionality severely reduced months infection well scientist reporting damages heart.

Instead media tells world affects old people everyone else fine. it’s surprise people flouting social distancing rules, wearing masks outright degenerates. Make sure look time year normal since summer lower winter. Idk answer state new sure whether looking yearly average monthly simply impossible Thanks heads up. parents live area careful pandemic. warned Orlando careful. ramming Supreme Court Justice moreimportant... *rolls eyes sad part mainstream media talking all. lot people seem given well. We're ticking time bomb moment vaccine hope.

This saddens most, absolute main stream media coverage COVID-19 anymore, making people believe lesser threat now. dangerous times ahead. That's fair, point Trump made bed Covid. response well documented, anyone cares already noticed this. 

I think people make decisions, fact something available even people getting still massive step forward. time expect available (probably spring), I'd wager we'll seen ~10-20% US infected. could get another 20-30% take early vaccines, that's near 50% immunity. Definitely herd, it'll lot slow spread. again, many people might go back ""normal"" it'll wash. Guess we'll see. Especially since read ""condensation"" first. 

It made sense interpret letters like that, brain... why? We’re talking quarantine people arriving international flights, lockdown. honest, feeling distress reading 90 year old dieing natural causes 8 year old dies cancer? Well, maybe not... take seriously going happen, going save higher number lives. guarantee it. least got tested. kids daycare said there's mandate teachers tested. 1/3 u.s. knows doctors phd's....  yeah right. 

God wish people would get smarter. would dying?

Also look flu season. encouraging factors flu also encourage covid. he's right. start planning now. place spend life. Thank goodness I'm part AZ mask mandate. serious issues since July. Best wishes Wisconsinites! gotta dumb think elimination virus easy. We, species, eradicated one virus, namely Smallpox, centuries work it. feel bad seniors live there. Thankyou! balancing act. 

That playing odds *is*. Picking choosing risks worth payoff, covering eyes pretending there's path risk all. That’s equivalent smart, correct kid, telling stupid polite way.  new lockdown measures nursing home orders follow? that, several documentaries matters span decades big pharma literally getting away murder. 

We still deal consequences ""these addictive."" good thing nobody pays medical advice Airlines need survive obviously cruises go die. Why? wearing masks sustainable? 

Do think ignoring kills hundreds thousands people, destroying economy sustainable long term? Welcome chronic illness.


They'll never believe you. That's worthy sacrifice top 0.1% get even richer. Virus compromises immune system making susceptible bacterial infection. relatively common practice, understand. he's icu, probably important make sure pick infections. Wtf? made statement would gone April. politicians make statements seen promise. don’t actually say promise. 

Are deliberately obtuse? you? data current stage 3 trials needed information determine one works best. doesn’t need new trial specifically comparing other. Yeah, I've read numerous articles rapid tests, affordable tests, billions available instant. Yet nothing. Still takes days get result back costs couple hundred bucks. Yeah, that's good idea. I'll try yeah shock money important public health. 200k rising everywhere, airports, offices, schools, dental clinics, hospitals, sports arenas, etc. said turned corner coronavirus...again. would explain going anywhere. We're going circle. I'm saying every possible form playing odds *good idea*. acknowledge playing, use make better decisions.

For instance could decide socialize all, get desperate, say fuck it, go bar, get drunk 5 unmasked strangers. could acknowledge I'm playing odds, take actual look stats, walk one friend park wearing mask.

This still socializing, still puts little dent crushing loneliness, still risks others. gathering, still technically illegal location. 10 minutes first situation 40,000 million chance spreading disease, compared 0.5 million chance second (numbers calculator).

Yes agree that. problem changing winner takes ranked voting won’t fix base issue anymore. parties set foreseeable future across almost states.
