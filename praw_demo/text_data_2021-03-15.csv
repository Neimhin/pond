0,2021-03-15," Shame UK, I've donated 3 times since pandemic. need put blame AstraZeneca, since company keeps missing delivery targets anyway. earlier post pretty SUS ask recent poll said 47% Trump voters said don’t plan getting vaccinated anytime soon, gives idea. Uh, HIV tests EXTREMELY accurate - like, 99.7-100% accurate is. damn clue talking about? add that, widespread usage PrEP free HIV testing gay men, we've largely contained epidemicin recent years. work pharma. biological product could batch issues example. need batch records checked among things. 
Even original trial data fine, could sketchy batch killing people. think 28 cases overall, 28 cases batch 100k vials different story. 
 
Worth considering may also occurring uk smaller sample size monitoring may less able detect issues. uk vaccine hysteria may also reducing likelihood people self-reporting issues etc.
UK 8mil doses EU AZ factories btw someone says british sites somehow better virtue britishness. look methods testing economics it, makes perfect sense exclude you.  people dumb. literally repliyng comment explaying rare occurance Noralwah general one seen UK. Ehat going on. Germany played politics AZ vaccine. natural outcome that. No, they’re large almost soft - come two package, basically taste like raw Crisco held together tiny bit flour. Anecdotally, people know getting Moderna get ass whooped lot harder two. Still small price pay. Errr vaccinate 10m people vaccine certain number going heart attacks, stroke, get cancer, trip stone etc. Nothing vaccine happens large group people. simple google search would show antibodies last atleast 6 months people... said, antibodies 1 part complex immune system... no, assume 1 5 people infected ""recently""...... said, there's evidence virus spreading way thought probably infecting around 10x people #'s for. thought supposed ""learn Asia""? ""crushed together people"" definitely ""the norm"" there.  leave another arab nation? Oh wait, want you. lucky, bet even though Israel treating like shit arab nations would probably threat ten times worse. Sluggish approach contracts... EU's signed one day UK's... that's another thing nobody happy about.


We understand politicians trying save asses. 

Btw give little lesson Boris co... think forced signing brexit deal given tantrums throw daily basis. They're also like fiddle. much arm lymph nodes little swelling neck nodes. that's going away Pfizer worse according stats UK. That’s thought. Hence confusion can’t “honest debate” this. Why? OK, start vaccinating people Given half Trump voters say won’t get vaccine ATM, I’d say we’ve reached many 65. we’ve got pretty close least. norway barely used Vaccines, case hospital, kinda scary.

I belive read part norway got barely like 2-3 deaths age 30, one death ties vaccine starting rival virus significantly.. tho looking deaths 70 90 theres like 200-300 dying without vaccine would still less risk getting vaccine, healthy health workers near time hospital got injection falls ill vaccine bloodclot time... seems kind sus. Pfizer vaccine issues severe allergic reactions reason established possible carry warn people history allergies allergic reactions. trying establish link preexisting condition could cause people develop otherwise incredibly rare thrombotic events given AZ vaccine (or certain batch it), exists, check prior administering it. link, that's ok too, check. summer going insane majority US vaccinated. I‘m going kiss every stranger see party like it’s summer 69. makes wonder places UK administering vaccine incorrectly then, case need figure fuck going either way seems happening recently certain parts world. ok updated first comment clear confusion guess. 50% close enough. state governments need talk medical experts. Absolutely. 6 feet bullshit number, inconvenient they'll change 3.

Idk can't simply come terms fact evidence points kids missing enormous chunks education far dangerous impactful longterm COVID infections. kids less deadly flu incidence post-viral syndrome similar. one ever suggested closing schools permanently protect kids flu. different. They're 0. less number blot clot events UK Pfizer AZ. statistically insignificant. see that. I'm pretty certain already it. shot Saturday laid 30 hours decent fever exact aches pains arm instead entire body. pretty amazing virus infect multiple millions people even know even amazing science allowed us create model infections arms order train immune systems. go home visit family, family cross border visit them. regular letters home, proved covid19 remain active surfaces 72 hours. EMA says vaccination shouldn’t paused though, experts Europe don’t consensus. love this. Public health experts *love* this. cause differences, without differences would Denmark Sweden something like 30 wars :)
It factor probaly important one.
Denmark Sweden chosen different aproaches DK testing lot keeping epidemic lower level Sweden chosen different path. political choice whats right wrong, would say difference Sweden fx DK mainly driven aproach. want go it. Biden continued call 2000 dollar check even 600 already gone out. France sold sub-standard medical products UK whilst UK part EU. Im tired this.
Instead vaccinating like crazy making better measures time it, gonna continue game ""lockdowns"".
People give shit before, spent whole year inside ""good citizen"" LITERALLY PROGRESS last year.
Ffs.
No fucking difference.

So disappointed German government bureaucracy everything else.
What disgrace suspect anything find pattern want data through, suspend vaccination definitely prove aren’t linked possible condition?

In case, burden proving plausible link halting, way round, since big data inevitable get stochastic clusters seeming trends random noise. understand, thanks. article failed mention doses come full untill sometime around September/October, untill July supposed get like 14 million. Better nothing guess damn bad experts say shouldn’t pause vaccination though - Unfortunately, passed Hgb/Hct test years. gave often college never able since. :/ Cue Peggys dancing joy,""Permanent misery!!!"" Major international bodies agree vaccination paused (WHO, EMA, International Society Thrombosis Haemostasis). national level, many European countries advised paused, U.K., Australia Canada conclude continue.

Independent scientists (http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/tag/covid-19/) take stance (many asked provide insight don’t give specific stance) almost say vaccinations continue.

The fact is, national bodies acting international consensus, recognise that. I've donated blood twice since January antibody stats. Canada btw numbers actually like 3 120,000 look Norway. bet Canada much nicer it. probably take virus seriously most, given blood multiple times throughout pandemic. Theoretically, unit blood save three lives. age, serious complications COVID 'unlikely'. odds still favor donating blood. 

It make bit nervous every time it. Hopefully donating one time get vaccine. freedom deadly pandemic likely take France, Italy Spain halt use AstraZeneca vaccine) added reached government India, World Health Organisation (WHO), several reputed organisations seek contracts, assurances buying stock, advances production. “No one replied. one took urgency,” said. Week 4 first Oxford/AstraZeneca shot today. couple questions:

Thank you! hour, producing 3.75 lakh syringes. capacity go 25 40 per cent September (which would mean jump production capacity 4.68 lakh per hour 5.25 lakh per hour),” Nath, also forum coordinator AIMED, said.

1 lakh = 100 thou person, want. masks outdoors requiered. especially one around. dont rely gov. hold hand times ;)  greater risk acknowledged here? many people may die result ban compared extremely small blood clot risk?

I think there’s media hysteria. Someone mentioned creates opportunity EU scapegoat vaccine rollout failure...sounds like it. love donating blood last time first seizure life 17. :/. Ik I'm okay now, 8 months later, I'm scared. That's went labcorp got checked em. I'm getting vaccine 25th. Knowing UK government, found dangerous, they'd put gag order everyone keep giving it. they'd ban protests eventually leaked... oh... still concern either way vaccinations appear 0.

Pfizer vaccine also reports blood clots UK, [per Yellow find funny vaccine amount published research worst reputation. follow studies Moderna vaccine? Oxford constantly publishing new information vaccine rollout expanded. really seems like best course action trial never speak again. impostor sus Perhaps seen weird issues multiple blood clots, low levels platelets bleedings Norway, Denmark Germany reports UK data. reported ill effects younger people. know corona variants stronger still showing positive antibodies back January 28. first antibody test Red Cross positive August 2020. Yes, unclear said ""ordinary vaccines"", suggests contrast non-ordinary vaccines. mRNA vaccines atypical candidates (a *relatively* new technology), mRNA vaccines, sounded like saying spending efforts developing manufacturing traditional vaccines. outdoors crowded areas. nobody runs around mask outside person around. cares? live let live.  1 shot $8 2 shots $3000 would want give vaccine to...a vaccine?? Sorry, resist.  Donated every 8 weeks pandemic tested negative every time. Good peace mind. I'm getting vaccine soon wondering change next donation show antibodies That’s question well. Originally gonna get JJ, seems it’s possible switch one. mRNA ones different thing. canceled JJ, decided suck get Pfizer now. believe JJ said May June may second booster shot. Yes, there's window early late antibodies present. Really good hear. Hopefully shipment administration happen soon. concerning see spike there. agree you. It’s okay fire tens millions people aren’t comfortable getting shot time. fire CO getting it, teachers, doctors, grocery store workers, ect would need fairly axed too. problem drawing conclusions paragraph, virtually every sentence annotated footnotes two credentials? Proof spreading fake news agree it’s terrifying people sense superiority (how many commentators Reddit bots though?) think people aren’t getting shot stupid deserve jobless! healthcare workers turned down? people really want see tens millions fellow citizens lose work making personal choice don’t like? people seem get it’s still approved emergency orders, people protected forced take experimental drugs due happened Nazi Germany. 
I’ve noticed people shoved medical tyranny/propaganda like masks everyone’s throats people already COVID and/or low risk category and/or work comfortably home ones jumping get shot even takes away someone higher risk getting it. That’s way selfish keeping mouth nose covered you’re even sick world gone mad would anything anyone make sense? Yes. Also platelets. donated October 2020 still showed positive antibodies August blood donation. Im going agree raise um..... zero medical procedure vaccine EVER legally required work, shop, etc etc. currently autonomy ourselves. right refuse medical procedure medicine. Legally mandating vaccine medical procedure NEVER happen. slippery slope sir True. got downvoted hell back saying workplace 5% test positive 20-30% exposed. people really want excuse done restrictions. I've seen people claim 60% Americans antibodies add 10% vaccinated top that. decided talking elsewhere cancel JJ ahead Thursday. found Pfizer hospital parents got Phizer. finished intake work online tonight. want sure us know. live big city bad. coworkers getting Pfizer well. get go visit parents, go get shot. distance gonna drive anyway. Thanks opinions Prions undetectable autopsy. There's test definitively show presence absence blood, certain population significantly higher chance carrying them, there's zero reason risk spreading prion diseases via transfusions. single protein prion configuration potentially cause 100% fatal disease. already years symptoms appear. cure, treatments, definitive diagnosis post-mortem brain tissue examination. fuck around prion diseases. Based florida Transmissions definitely slowing down. stop yet. still 26,770 active cases (vs 85000 peak, early February) declining everyday, even though everything open weeks now. saying get pfizer moderna. joke.  article misses reported Danish, Norwegian German health agencies blood clots per se, extremely rare combination multiple blood clots, low level platelets bleedings. Never heard that. reporting different based day week. important number average number cases week. I'm sorry hear that. Apparently people still falling victim it? think something he'd carrying around years, recently caught it? hope questions bother you, realize still going on. Wikipedia? Well yeah, duh. time developed enough antibodies test positive blood, active infection long over. told antibody test means covid right now? It’s actually nice donating blood check online antibodies. Please donate can! received shot 9th lymph nodes left side neck/jaw sore since Friday. connected vaccine now, makes sense. little 10%? make it? could March though I’m saying. Nothing changed Timing, time money. Timing tech gained maturity recently. Time because, normally takes years test get approval vaccine treatment, particularly pandemic people getting sick scale. pandemic forced government fast track normally slow testing process, aka operation lightspeed, also gave pfizer moderna massive test beds candidates. Lastly, money. pandemic really brought attention funding companies technology allowed scale quickly ensure future r&amp;d field. likely. Sunday always reset/logistics day since campaign began. people see report see comments like say "" see need masks everything open 100 percent ! "" Yeah, probably closer 1 3. elaborate mental illness is.

If acceptable lock murder cage, certainly acceptable say can't gun. However, somehow record expunged believe rights back. Countries decided EU this. 

Every country allowed themselves! Nah USA hoarding AZ instance. 

And banned raw materials aren’t even vaccines yet. Texas stupid this, makes sense even doesnt completely blow face. guaranteed cause people get covid people die. Canada never choice production facilities. buy much could. contracts got stalled manufacturing holdups, delivery catch even outpace original timeline. There's still proof AZ's long term safety find interesting entire article focuses shall say, rhetorical ways convince someone afraid. Talk loved ones, explore concerns, woman trained convince people. 

Why discussion simply citing safety statistics?  safe, right?  comes getting Covid hear 60% people young age group symptoms. seem hear vaccines. best hear ""I sick single day after"". 

There's definite messaging problem. I’m glad I’m one. local hospital set transfusion center high risks patients eligible long it’s within first 10 days diagnosis, it’s working really well understand. It’s bad hospitals aren’t able set one up. mention dumb president changed health minister 4th time since coronavirus arrived here! genius! Vaccines work Mentally ill 18 year old paroled child murderer bazooka ok you? 

Again - really want get far goes. Finally, Mississippi front page something good! go open bar without mask, wtf talking about? mean can't deny it'd sad time anyone got worst covid without dying, point might lose perspective saying bolsonaro straight reject them. stop listening him. power everyone tunes out. He’s saying like 30 years told would wall. Numbers could include doses Sunday, saw only1,40,000 doses Sunday. hope numbers remain high rest week. Without Trump bump, media large hard time keeping audience like used to.

HuffPo recently quite layoffs. sarcasm. Thanks.  Yeah guess rely us That's nuts Yeah true even smaller cities like live outside Austin still masking. seeing people gas pumps walking around still wearing them. went three mile walk today hike bike trail woman wearing one put mine vicinity - even necessary wide open spaces, lots breeze would make actual effort get less six feet another person literal couple seconds.

I seen man little kid downtown walking among small mom pop stores wearing masks, walking outside stores. 77 year old mother fully vaccinated still wear masks everywhere go outside home still get groceries delivered.

Hey monumental weirdo. Nobody gives shit Israeli/Palestinian grudge. Get fuck already. It’s 3000 years. Move fuck on. can't wait!! spray put nose block flu entering, amazing science! didn’t lie didn’t know yet. perhaps I’m misunderstanding question political motive would behind CDC finding whether 3ft separation enough? Yes super exciting. 

Flu pretty much nonexistent year world - give people perspective infectious covid really is. 

But yeah - back ability rapidly program vaccines game changer. man imbecile............the secondary damage covid causing blood organs killing people months fact, first dose last week Oxford. researched, chose Pfizer. Well said. I'm fiercely pro-vaccine science. reality blessed highly effective vaccines. permits pause evaluation odd circumstance popping up. Meanwhile we’re fucking around allowing 65 get vaccine. 

Open shit already. Enough enough. 

If didn’t get vaccine December, January, February, they’re going now. 

Let rest us get vaccinated! lets gooooooo GOT FIRST SHOT TODAY :)))))))  point obvious, 3 people 3 countries die receiving AstraZeneca vaccine week makes wonder wtf us going 

Their trial frozen twice “deaths” I’m sure statistical analysis done, 54,000 participants reported close 10,000 side effects. Holy shit half placebos 

Meanwhile Moderna Pfizer covering North America vaccines don’t seem kill people realize action anybody takes regard AZ vaccine damned damned thing, US dumping stockpile poorer nations right good look, even everyone would still willing get it.

also I'd imagine biden counting vaccines model reopening summer, going anywhere. much effective flu vaccine, mRNA offers, might outright eliminate flu years. Brazil 50% positivity rate would hell lot deaths.

I'm using official data here. health ministry says made 23 million tests. 11 million confirmed cases.

You're also assuming Brazil actually tests people normal fashion. Contact tracing widespread testing federal policy since 4 ministers ago. easy high positivity rate barely ever test possible assymptomatic cases mild cases.

[Brazil's ministry health even tried donate million tests due expire April That's tests states received, stuck due use government policy. power precedent US judges self-selected something called Collegium Judges, judges chose become judges. executive legislative branches authority them. made insanely powerful consider authority anything everything. see literally demanding Executive explain vaccine role phased. none business!!

Finally, leave this, perhaps single insane thing done. Supreme Court decide certain rights Constitution immutable cannot changed (even legslature) even though Constitution never stated that. Supreme Court never defined rights constitutes Basic Doctrine requires laws pass Basic Doctrine test (ie violate undeclared Basic Doctrine) else strike law down. absurd one stopped them. It’s damn crazy!!! Interesting. take ‘too damned far’?

Like, specific circumstance? 

And say, restrictions - limit firearm ownership regulated? mentally ill child able machine gun, instance? trying gauge mean ‘any restriction’. used normalized quotes, I'm assuming fully normal. would say normalized means go sit bar friends, birthday party house, travel business. hand, nightclubs may capacity limits crammed in, still need masks planes, large indoor concerts can't happen 100% capacity.

So 100% pre-COVID normal, way better last summer. Bear mind development done exponentially faster vaccine due health need, going perfect. mean.. doesn't. Money solve problems vaccine doses hoarded rich countries. country placing order vaccines getting anytime soon. Fair, though would make distinction meant “normalized” “totally back normal” timeline actually agree with.

Some groups locations problems (especially among youths choose vaccinate), expect able restart travel family visits us vaccinated voluntarily avoided ethical implications accidentally spreading virus reasonable protections. go away every adult *who wants it* given opportunity.

Furthermore, don’t reach herd immunity purely recalcitrant anti-vaxers, rate doesn’t really matter implied... getting 4 million day weeks earlier doesn’t convince eligible won’t accept relent, comment “we 4m” still doesn’t make sense.

Finally, we’ve definitely seen *some* people won’t right thing, it’s remarkably small proportion! 75%+ wear masks, limit plans etc, need go long way towards full herd immunity vaccine (if indeed doesn’t get us already). great thing vaccinations isn’t like cloth masks one person refusing participate infect hundreds others. might take casualties irresponsible behavior, it’s far less impactful long majority protected vaccines appear provide far. I'd get checked you. Completely agree, tensions rise countries reopen whilst European ones still lockdown. Dr Osterholm saying another wave coming. Yes. Europeans already hesitant relation current issue came due low protection first dose AstraZeneca found provide protection rate 76% three months, goes 82.4% second dose administered 12 weeks.

Maybe used expert dr Biden make decisions based recommendations, hasn’t. responsibility don’t care he’s actually saying, think it’s counterproductive. im worried got easter eggs az, normally drop nice interim data results something Still can't get appointment 75 y/o grandparents PA (York County). UK also get supply originally expected last year, also publicly lash AZ it. Brazil 50% positivity rate would hell lot deaths. making point, total number cases useful metric, one way another.  problem good day. Things got really really bad shot. still dream things magically going back normal day. Glad hear friend well though now. wife tested positive top December, mild symptoms although worse still lingering cough. get tested wait times back want drag infected butt public. I've donated blood twice since times antibodies came back negative.

I would think it, wife false positive sick... symptoms pretty dead on. first time went hike recovering chest pain felt unusually weak.

I know why, annoys me, knowing. We're still working home next vaccine group, I'm worried. positive antibody result really change anything. Yeah, Palestians?  weighted density meaningless. Germany example medium cities mostly. Sweden Stockholm already 20% population. Similar Amsterdam. things simple compare.

We Literally see germany worst affected parts super close borders believe economy integrated large cross even pandemic.

Swedes dont travel right pandemic. Nobody taking boat rides fun anymore. simple reality mainland Europes economies cultures super connected. cant control one bridge ferry route fine.

And socially arent similar know lived there.

I'm sure whether that's due us bad job (I'm pretty sure we're since we're little average total percent population immunized) overall vaccine compliance rate higher. vaccinate people in-line Chick-fil-a they'd get me.

You sound like last week able book appointment. completely overjoyed. 

Got first shot today They, too, dealt get vaccines people who're eager take them.

West Virginia thing. expanded list pre-existing conditions classified essential, basically everybody point. Sie können kommen. Es wird nicht geprüft. look death rate going. 80% month.

The vaccines (AZ Pfizer) phenomenally effective safe moment.

If arguing don’t know yet whether future issues, past history vaccines shown nothing significant long term short term safety ok. basis testing carried them.

Do use medicines food products proved safe say 50 years? not, using double standards. think profit: money right now, long-term profit.

China smart leadership able look forward much longer time leadership does. suspect they’re playing long game vaccine. see long term investment them. don’t make money selling it, make money influence derive it.

EUs current portfolio includes diverse range US'. arguments EU starting become brainless stabs people upvote read exactly mentioned. I'll admit efficacy scare something thought too, listened podcast explained number probably wrong, regardless number representing much AZ prevented death serious illness. understand good vaccine.

Show value individuals much common good.

But understand someone would disagree, think variant overall theme. Like look total number participants test. course also people representing every group ages, sexes, place birth, race etc. individual group certain individuals weighed in. Maybe confident then, threshold determines something happens expect, stop, look data reevaluate. may say ""lets this, keep vaccinating"" think even high risk.

In Ohio, highest risk able get appointment yet, opening groups make HARDER.

I think often metrics tie green/yellow/red infections ramping much different metrics would use ramp down.

When ramping up, hospitalizations, deaths etc lagging metrics want use time move, late. use % positivity, case counts per 100k, etc. ramping down, metrics want use they're showing accomplished set accomplish, whereas case count per 100k always relatively high floor children vaccinated. places giving people second dose unless get first dose second dose allotment supposed match many corresponding first doses did. least that’s vaccination sites saying Wisconsin data says outdoor transmission thing. Getting appointment seeming lot difficult showing pharmacy asking vaccine. sure are, I'm CA, necessary groups, randomly asked could get CVS something else. 1 person vaccine time said sure got first shot Moderna weekend. got home went online see pharmacy showing open appointments nothing available, even though nobody pharmacy appointment time. true means COVID-19 2-3x deadly seasonal flu? Seriously? can’t hold couple months? Like May? close good place. states hospitalizations cases plateaued. general population vaccinated contagious variant states, wish could hold number vaccinated people more. I’m sick this. hard wear mask bit longer greater good? real possibility another surge don’t know coronavirus seasonal. again, I'm saying numbers good vaccines good, simply nations created vaccines without profit.

The pandemic over, though. want get profit part sucks every way look it, medical logic behind additional shots. 

The third shot get protect variants first 2-dose vax effective against. already mRNA candidates trials. 

Booster shots come immunity wanes might year, might two... know yet. does, since coronavirus pretty assuredly endemic, we'll want booster. booster able contain full spectrum protection presumably single shot booster multi-shot regimen like initial vaccination. think hearing 2 years likely, infectious variants might stuck annual. Pfizer execs get dictate this, possible even best vaccine exists falter variants 2 years. 

There's 2nd type ""booster"" (not debate semantics) would periodic shots protect variants emerge, similar annual flu shots simply repeat boosters way tetanus vaccine is. ""long term"" studies ***never*** revealed anything ***known*** fucked vaccines.

Children different, millions adults gotten shots also seems safe 12-17 age group well.

They going go descending age order, older selected first study. essentially step go along seems safe. Excess deaths really start pick last 2 weeks March, people died late March likely infected early March late February. definitely already significant enough spread February super unlikely symptoms match, especially loss smell/taste.

Remember takes multiple generations spread become noticeable. 1 person could pass 3 others, pass 3, etc. takes time reach critical mass become noticeable statistics, especially early spread among younger people likely die it. course, already every day plenty travel EU Union hermetically sealed. summer early fall vaccination give us significant protection, it’s safe assume safer August now, even travel restriction easing threat emerging variants.  started thinking annual boosters would needed, starting think maybe biannually anything all. data Moderna released January seem high titers thorough 120 days. oldest folks really starting drop titer wise.

Agree sucks kids can't get vaccinated. Adults need join herd already. It’s good problem have, means we’re risk falling well short herd immunity. could lead us getting fall there’s another outbreak. NY Times pretty in-depth US cases back early February. However, seems like main difference cases German ones six German cases thrombocytopenia well cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (from understanding) whereas US cases primarily thrombocytopenia.

Here's relevant part NY Times article:

""Hematologists expertise treating immune thrombocytopenia said suspected vaccine play role. said cases vaccination likely exceedingly rare, possibly result unknown predisposition people react vaccine developing immune response destroys platelets. disorder occurred, rarely, people received inoculations, particularly measles-mumps-rubella one.

“I think possible association,” Dr. James Bussel, hematologist professor emeritus Weill Cornell Medicine written 300 scientific articles platelet disorder, said interview. “I’m assuming there’s something made people developed thrombocytopenia susceptible, given tiny percentage recipients are.”

He added: “Having happen vaccine well-known seen many vaccines. happens, don’t know.”

Dr. Bussel said important share information cases, severe thrombocytopenia serious, physicians need know treat it. Sometimes condition resists standard therapies, low platelet counts persist, patient faces increasing risk severe bleeding even brain hemorrhage.

A patients previously platelet disorders autoimmune conditions might made vulnerable, Dr. Bussel (pronounced Bew-SELL) said. People low platelets without symptoms, possible some, vaccine reaction could drop level further, point becomes apparent causing bruises bleeding, Dr. Bussel said.

Source: idea ""natural disaster"" two components: 1, humans cause it, 2, humans power stop slow it. first part applies covid, logically imply second part also true. empirically, know second part *not* apply covid, masks effective way humans slow it. me! week I’m half gallon 🩸 Yeah predictions course humans require incentives many people require carrot stick. government tells wear mask vax say thanks. mind change say mask live normal please get shot? Maybe. Oh here's 5,000 cash, maybe. Like seriously! swear practically every online article. rank innumeracy. Italy (to take one example), country 1 170,000 citizens dying Covid *every day*, suspended vaccine grounds might 1 460,000 *one-time* risk generally non-fatal complication.

Even blood clot concern turns totally true totally causal, Covid-vulnerable European would better getting AZ today waiting (at least) several months vaccine without risk.

Good news: Europe seems realizing [reversing Oh yeah that's meant. can't change appointments Florida either. meant delay going vaccine aka miss appointment find new one later date sure. appointment tomorrow there's much hang onto seems :/ vaccine halted couple days ago. would made impact anything happening now. Production next 3 month. German article information: That’s meant.. things correlated. Didn’t express well, sorry. People don’t insurance may likely work somewhere exposes covid, lack insurance wouldn’t cause catch covid (obviously). think vaccinations going bring zero covid world sorely mistaken. People die covid every year, flu. also don’t always develop antibodies. Dewine flat said exact strategy. 

Seems like people lying teeth anyway lot risk/occupational groups. Might well make wide open. least way unethical folks aren’t getting ahead. friend's husband (61 years old) could AZ vaccine week decided wait something better.  frustrating. hopefully export EU though tbh. Many countries deserve literally manufacturing own. Yes, less effective — sorry, commenting MRNA J&amp;J vaccines. agree body post. Evidence different countries shown people willing get vaccinated vaccination rolls out. 75-90% acceptance rate vs. 60-70% think there’s chance maskless travel could resume summer?

No.

**SPECULATION:**

The EU dropping ball lot vaccinations, Japan. Even guys states get everything ""under control."" going enough portion population COVID countries, even ones without COVID problem, going want possible influx people might carrying it.

My guess going odd country late summer going accept travelers them. could probably get away bullshit like traveling country hit hard COVID traveling much ass could probably now.

EDIT: Even travel opens back I'm betting masks going required long time. Airlines love security theatre anything do, minimal effort, makes look like taking things seriously going take full advantage of. guess UK variant causing problem more? That's right, UK. that?

- Claiming hoping masking ""a permanent thing.""

- Refusing view public health measures cost-benefit lens. IE: ""One death many!""

- Claiming society whole somehow incorrect corrupt people want resume normal lives vaccinated. clear up, calling mRNA vaccines specifically.   received Pfizer-BioNTech Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine January February matched terms symptoms eight months patients cohort unvaccinated.   researchers found received **a** vaccine “had small overall improvement long Covid symptoms”. hope governments manufacturers tracking manufactured vaccine batches [lot quickly identify batches vaccine went distribution locations.

It sounds like done investigating Thursday restart vaccinations.  Well painful. Especially highlights ""Further, restructuring society crushed together people become norm.”

If want packed arena screaming lyrics favorite band's songs people, let Swartzberg said much state could possibly enter green tier Californians reach community herd immunity — could happen summer. Still, said, Californians green tier counties would likely wear masks practice social distancing public spaces.

WTF point keeping health measures herd immunity? I've tolerated bunch goalpost shifts far. draw Siegel said green tier exist goal, something counties work toward. implemented case rates county reach zero — i.e., county community spread.

Oh come on. ""zero covid"" nuts taken seriously? impossible goal, least next “Until there’s eradication, there’s much flow California, you’ll still need wear masks things like certain situations,” said.

FFS never ""There’ll time people able family gatherings graduations weddings, that’s coming soon, we’ll never go back way things were.”

And kind public health messaging causes people abandon precautions altogether. dont see public would reacted done nothing tried dismiss effect.

I think whole thing storm teacup delays continue largely related supply. Meanwhile seems like us southern border closed hit piece immigration. pandamic going locked tight. reminds old saying: European American didn’t get boat. Florida worse case &amp; death rate California adjust population size.

Not sure people think brag about. much british bots teying paint AZ good. Oh, literally gone back. government seems want eu charge anymore. Good. EU bureaucratic organization fucked up. hands full banning lead ammo plastic straws. time vaccines I'd course. Priorities, people!!

Meanwhile sitting hard lockdown, first promised three weeks one. told us Easter banned lockdown relaxed them. after? Maybe weeks. Maybe. allowed leave home town area unless shopping essentials (everything else banned sold), allowed see people households, allowed leave district, even shopping. seen GF fucking 2 weeks looks another month go. perfect. Well people side effects would low chance dying due Covid need 3 transfusions 50% chance getting antibodies! Nice use dehumanising language, comforting note we're ones harbouring stupid hateful bigots. gets investigated.

No one issue investigations. People disagreed suspended that's article about. People sub persuaded arguments suspension regulatory agencies world weren't. may be, people aren't. primary care doctor told she’s multiple patients tested PCR positive mild symptoms test negative antibody test. don’t think it’s sensitive test. That’s fine, people continue cautious even they’re vaccinated respect goes ways. feel need continue distancing shouldn’t judge others hanging friends, going restaurants, etc. one high school teachers posted photo two vaccinated people someone left snarky comment, leaving teacher explain vaccinated outdoor patio restaurant. shit annoying. personally doubly vaccinated week friends family I’m going apologize ..yet there's mention particular syndrome AZ doses UK.

Also, slightly cases thrombosis Pfizer UK (25 cases v 23 cases per 10M). 30 30 BMI? lol YEAH PIECE SHIT COVID see statement change approval timeline. Original expectation early next year. Wait... political parties power shutdown whole industries Canada? That's wild. Well would still making profit nationalized - going giving NHS free. Thanks! can’t open I’m phone gonna get rest 20m??  stat matters.

Why? say stat odds dying getting infected

Obviously, since point discussion effect supposedly overcrowded hospitals overall high Brazil average age 30 years. average age Germany 45 years.

That's argument, need show strong correlation is. simple fact Brazil better Latin American countries similar demographics, doubt there's strong correlation 8x deaths Hamburg, even similar pop size.

We're talking country ratio, averages good bad decisions . going single locations make comparisons without context, desperately trying support political numbers get worst every week Brazil variants wil appear thanks Bolsonaro no-action policy.

What ""no-action"" policy? Supreme Court ruled state governors autonomy decide handle pandemic. putting blame federal government, hands tied, governors mayors made bad subjective opinion, respect it, shows bias better mistakes made above.

I'm done here. doubt anything worthy discussion come you. Bye. heads delusional anglos. 36....and wife 36 weeks pregnant.... It’s standard procedure administration drug vaccine paused serious case linked needs investigated. Even Britain makes perfect sense symptoms long covid actually result anxiety.

This anecdotal experience here, doubt brief brain fog Covid caused anxiety, since nervous anything time infected. totally asymptomatic 2.5 weeks exposure, never even crossed mind would complications got slammed brain fog briefly. 

Is studies symptoms actually related anxiety? think states hit 35-50% vaccination rate look starting open. combined warmer weather coming crazy think start moving direction. Really?

I see opposite. Every day someone complains people complaining wearing masks. issue! armpit hurt days moderne vaccine. must lymph node too. That’s crazy! Look communists sub would like steal skills. Im pretty sure AZ downgraded projection q2 deliveries 40m 50m. might referencing. propose then? Asking respectfully. would avoided millions steal food? Scam others money?

OK, I'm big fan Oxford Vaccine, note ""at cost"" element AstraZeneca indeed licensing Oxford University, private company spun around that, cost duration pandemic.. AZ also able start charging more. Good know! believe formula, maybe lower dose? seem impression anxiety entirely mood based doesn’t physical symptoms.

Your point seems “it’s anxiety, it’s real!”

My brain fog bad last year I’m edge getting fired. feel like dementia. I’ve never covid, anxiety.

I promise you, anxiety real illness. Yeah, spend stim money hard hit businesses stuff within.  EU's regulator disagrees Janssen already indicated meeting Q2 targets challenging ... Astrazeneca continued source uncertainty ... EU believes additional 10million Pfizer Q2 offset shortfalls ... Potentially coming refurbished Marburg plant went online earlier year currently going EMA validation. Also, there's political element ... Maybe charge. conspiracy exists head. Emmi Macron living rent-free there! rights end mine begin.

And rights end begin, gets us nowhere - think makes reasonable suggest guy wants Hitler-level atrocities disagreeing you. religious beliefs natural rights harmful expansion human rights. Sounds like wrong already posted pinned top. think assume though population get vaccinated probably overlaps pretty heavily group already infected. Given fact group largely believe science and/or vaccine, likely wearing masks following protocols whole time. Germany suspended AZ vaccines due similar cases ones Norway vaccinated population. federal sites started giving teachers states opened sites teachers yet. Indiana one example this. (The state sites opened teachers week later.) happy Ohio, what's deal Illinois? May 1st date 16+ Michigan April 5 Ohio Mar 29th. Right. understand that. may something *mRNA* vaccine strengthens/boosts immune response helps clear virus. That’s I’m saying. that’s case, shows suspending vaccination completely needed people injected potentially dangerous stuff. also means AZ safe intentional form. issue theres vulnerable members society innocent bystanders get caught middle all. mention potential overloads health care system. I'm taking style approach risk group vaccinated, find generally believing people who've took approach day 1 lack empathy. I'm talking decision previously let 1.7 million doses expire. point making asked ""don't find interesting zero stakeholders decided follow path?"" Pfizer, implying UK likely wrong based fact alone. 

I asked case AZ, avoid answering - therefore showing bad question.

I guess we'll see point UK right. calculated risk. 4 5 antibody tests? 4 5 covid tests? Hey ain't even Swedish, live here. Doctors baffled another false story non-profit vaccine sold fraction price commercial rivals spread. Due AZ latest delays sure using using AZ vaccine make much difference. Originally completed contract Q2. would make difference. looks like deliveries happen Q2. time already lots vaccines multiple manufacturers available. UK deaths declining daily. avoided deaths direct result vaccination programme, 11 million AZ. 

Whilst delay won’t “significant” effect, delay thousands people getting zab. week, inevitably hundreds people get covid eventually die. 

Yes it’s due number factors, delay vaccine result getting covid dying. 

And that’s even mentioning knock effect less vaccine confidence. one good access point left arm universal donor. try donate often usually massive pain. Last time bled everywhere except inside needle phlebotomist looked said ""I've never seen before."" bruise took 2 weeks go away. Nice know. set Randy filled instant. Othena awful. I’m Orange County too. Yes don’t count jj moderna deliver like 70 mln doses. Fingers crossed Az think increase largely happened flat high level. think Biden’s prediction get vaccinated end May pretty close. It’s still going take time, many getting vaccinated past couple weeks I’m hopeful. Earth talking about? whole seperate conversation yourself. decision based UK data.

Never said fine incidence AZ UK

It countries suspended equivalent spike vaccines.

There spike I'm telling read info states incidence rate observed Pfizer UK, AZ UK, AZ EU countries suspended use. said multiple times source that. responded directly person saying. would take priority group atm. 50% new cases 0-19, many 16, unvaccinated. Schools reopened reasonable cases stall due spike school kids.

New cases stalled two weeks 3600-3700 day (weekly average) since cratered 2200 week half still falling.

Meanwhile deaths hospitalizations falling consistently. Cases less useful metric kids much represented vaccines this, get X dead, get dead""?

To even able say must already pretty good knowledge currently happening. knowledge currently seem exist. experts want investigate. question therefore becomes one continue using AZ vaccine one knowledge not. CEO son holocaust survivors Netanyahu bombarded phone calls. guessing helped besides Israel made financially good deal Pfizer. Ah yes. Purely political conspiracy soly european countries undermine AZ vaccines hate UK.

Even though normal blood clots usual, not. 7 1.6m people encounter 3 possible deaths, reasons concern according PEI. Additionally 4 Norway rare conditions. That's exactly PEI investigating whether AZ caused conditions deaths related vaccinations.

The chief scientist PEI also said UK continuing vaccinations may two reasons. 1) cases, partly cerebral vein thrombosis focus far. 2) British vaccinated mainly different age group. Therefore, must examined European network ""whether actually cases caused vaccine whether random statistical fluctuations baffled. 
  
Not Doctors... Astra-zeneca fundamentally different type vaccine. created much traditionally 12 week gap recommended it. make reasonable assumptions based experience vaccines. 

Pfizer Moderna first mRNA vaccines ever created. ""known"" quantities means cannot make assumptions (yet JCVI handful selected data) vaccines similar nature. dosing sensitivity schedule complete unknowns found combination (50% dose, 21 days apart) achieved 95% efficacy. dosing schemes attempted, significantly less effective.

No one ever tried 50% dose, 84 days apart. essentially British public part mRNA vaccine trial completely unknown results. Wait also one thinks stay lockdown COVID fully eradicated? someone else (I honestly know). Severe cases, weekly average peaked 160, 70 now. Great article wife's parents late sixties, barely side effects immune response meaning vaccine working. Wow special kind dumb. I’m sure means died vaccine. 

The serious side effects happen people allergies, I’ve seen anyone die since doctors well prepared adverse reactions. feel vaccinated, able cross. numbers showing vaccine works. wish there's least plan that's going take place decide open borders. really hard able see girlfriend Canada. worded awfully 0 uk deaths due blood clots 13 blood clot events. Stop trying twist data. 14 days 1st dose getting protection all. surprising people 1 shot dying getting hospitalized time spent 1 shot unprotected (2 weeks 3) Hopefully use vaccine resumed within days EMA investigation goes well, one letting go doses yet. Believe me, EU member want fall even behind vaccination programs.  Considering tail end pandemic, headline could probably published weekly next 8 months accurate. It’s clotting that’s issue, it’s it’s seen conjunction low levels thrombocytes (platelets), rare combination symptoms. Israel 80%+ 60+ population fully vaccinated February 1 iirc. pretty good. vaccine = vaccinations lymph nodes reacting near injection site good thing makes wonder advantage disadvantage getting shots arm. like training immune system via lymph nodes better giving left arm lymph nodes 2 training sessions giving arm one? Wondering studied. means Pfizer/Biontech delivering even faster US Q2. end Q2 nearly 300 million doses vaccine delivered.

I’ve rarely heard anyone getting spots that, mostly luck draw signing regional/county sites. Don’t know botched badly year prepare. 

Incredibly cruel way they’ve done 20 year old smokers competing 79 year old diabetics spots. Can't believe downvoted this. 

Great links! Pfizer uses 30mcg dose Moderna uses 100mcg dose. may explain increased incidence side effects Moderna shot.

Also booster dose tested 20mcg 50mcg forms believe. Plus they're also testing one that's combination OG strain SA variant.
So theoretically booster dose mild original dose, knows! Crazy. scary thing thing could much higher fatality rate absolutely worthless preventing transmission. War Worlds. technology, taken virus even see. school person since August. cases among kids, none traced back school. 

Every teacher got infected traced back personal life.

Six feet three feet? strive six, accept three kids generally closer throughout days.

I really skeptical person August point believer. reason keep school closed.  UK 8mil doses EU AZ factories btw someone says british sites somehow better virtue britishness.

This number gets inflated every time see someone quote it. we've received 8 million doses AZ EU, might well close AZ factories we've delivered 11 million doses total. Heads would rolling even remotely close true sides fence. Also EU vaccines manufactured Belgium factory, delivered vaccines UK. saying manufacturing facility fault, that's another factor differs UK EU. Got first shot last Friday. Booked trip Key West June also Friday. One journalist one publisher one member country says X = ""EU says X"" do, that's think outrageous governments playing games this. Reas article, suspended european countries suspended it. basically due ""blood clots"" significant compared sample size.

Multiple sciencitific bodies came say AZ safe, scare tatic coming european countries. Pausing vaccine instil fear take vaccine. ready huge issue one taking AZ people like Macron.

The investigation good, even EMA suggested continue use vaccine risk pausing far outweighs risk taking it. like many counties acknowledgement good, pausing stupid. giving much credit, can't plan jackshit. Nothing planned. course absolutely fine mess, probably much richer me, get sick give pals call get best treatment available. mean people charge 2 things likely way related.... argument never ""every single life matters"".   argument lockdowns prevent health care system collapsing due potentially high rates hospitalization, resource stretching triaging, etc 

That's lockdowns initially, aka ""flattening curve"". However goalposts moved countries trying (unsuccessfully) eliminate virus, everyone became obsessed death rates. includes vaccines, OAZ. EU countries really sending best this. Might depend. I'm donate blood tissues personally. Ask doctor hopefully they'll know. non-Israelis Gaza &amp; West Bank? US withholding vaccines. That’s equivalent almost half entire EU population. That’s HUGE. 3 cases Norway. There's least 6. monumental given level supply received. consolation, I'm allowed donate anymore I'm negative blood apparently mutant rage beast hell according Red Cross. hand though, least know blood mutant rage beast hell factually instead assumptions. Sorry case you. Hugs. British public misled faulty statistics. find interesting zero stakeholders decided follow path? 44% vaccinated, 36% vaccinated recovered iirc. probably 3-4% vaccinated run truly hardcore anti vaxx. 28% ineligible due 16. stay home. going anyways. Nothing changes you. get pretentious hero imagine yourself, everyone hate gets drink dinner sit restaurant dies. Everyone wins! *resumes playing sad flute* Good, get damn vaccine people. I've also seen studies suggesting good too! Great, friends take AZ. rest us take Pfizer Modern. Powered latest 'mRNA Bionic M14X' chip. also people started donating blood antibody testing, may part population higher risk gotten covid Where? I’m SF can’t find vaccine life me. walk Moscone? hospitals COVID wards close.

Cases becoming less less relevant metric, 50% new cases 0-19 demographic, another 25% 20-39.

There different demographics Israel, mainly Arabs, Ultraorthodox rest (religious secular). Among non Arab, non Ultraorthodox vaccination rate crazy. We're talking 97%+ 50+ either recovered vaccinated. 90%+ adults (it's something like 94% iirc sure). Ichilov major hospital Tell Aviv mainly serves non Arabs non Ultraorthodox (just makeup demographics area).

Many new severe COVID cases among Arabs exhibit significant anti vaxx sentiment (more like 70% 50+ recovered vaccinated) lesser degree among Ultraorthodox number somewhat better Arabs.

Deaths fell 60+ day, weekly average, 17. thing deaths lag behind infection hospitalization. full immunity taking 4-5 weeks first shot, things take time. think negative antibody test proves anything, especially mild case. could it, bad enough detectable amount antibodies went get tested Mmm hmm. Fired cause stupid thing do. affects everyone. Making stupid decisions prolongs pandemic everyone. covid nurse, explain you?

If person goes bar risks infection really affect them? take home, work place rest society, covid nurse?

They're not, doubt difference antibody rates US population whole blood donators large (i.e. likely 20% blood donators antibodies 5% 40% population whole do). words, perfect, think serves reasonable proxy starting point herd immunity. 

If work assumption 20% unvaccinated people antibodies, need 50-60% remaining 80% vaccinated get good chance herd immunity. Obviously want many people vaccinated possible, gives us point start able see huge dropoffs case counts. Dropping like stone? Better bomb Palestinian hospitals retaliation.

The second one finished somewhere around end February, presume batches come. heard news third one. high school overcrowded hallways would packed tightly like pictures trains Tokyo rush hour. relieve built new school. time built new school already capacity funding secured account future growth. least say less crowded old school (they still using new school building) even kid appalled little kid's parents really cared them. left lasting impression adulthood. *Cough* numbers came India *Cough* US exporting?

I'm genuinely curious this. trail period long? reached 12-14 months coronavirus. NYC nowhere near prestige qualifying times necessary. It’s like comparing high school varsity basketball NBA... least choice. wound getting J&amp;J. I'm happy it. actually fucked everyone 2020...lol didn’t even defer race gave virtual one refund. Pretty messed ask me. Oh well, I’ve got another year qualify slow ass type clots Denmark Austria though. seem popping little randomly EU 😢😪 question little light googling didn’t seem answer (mrna awfully new all), i’m wondering we’ll get 3-in-1 shot one day? like mrna sequences three target proteins could mixed one fluid administered. that’d definitely neat does, measuring people, doses. There's less people vaccinated doses given person needs two shots. Closed schools benefit poor. fact, bear brunt without money pods private schools. Yeah, used drill per year Parkland shooting, Florida law requires us monthly. It’s called EU led smear campaign Remember last time Brazil listened US Covid?

Is Bolsonaro still popping hydroxychloroquine? Same. agree you. said area keeps passing bonds fix old schools (which vote for) really squander money. old buildings aren’t poorly ventilated, although bc hvac systems, bc drafty. could least try get windows work though! mean...please don’t take wrong way feel obese people shouldn’t given vaccine early. It’s pre-existing condition way say immune deficiency even diabetes is. know increases risk that’s risk take obese.  smokers, smokers higher risk allowed get early due self inflicted conditions?

Ridiculous.  still sure said untrue? ... I'm mostly advocate people stop whining paying bucks extra taxes means bigger schools built overcrowding proper ventilation systems installed.

I'm old remember overcrowded poorly ventilated schools district... best district around. People constantly whining paying taxes sustain though. pathetic. kids I'm completely willing pay taxes other's kids first world education. early March “plateau” US (approximately year pandemic), 9% Americans “tested positive” covid-19. 25% American adults (1/3 Latinos) believe covid (suggesting many admittedly have/could get covid test despite symptoms believing covid.) 20% blood donors covid antibodies. (Blood donors skew non-POC - Latinos donate blood far lower rate white black people; there’s anecdotal presumptions blood donors adherent public health guidelines.) substantial regional variance seroprevalence, lower WA, OR, VT, (places per capita cases remained low), higher FL, TX, AZ (where cases high “surged” times.) 

The number true cases probably something close three times number reported cases. Can't... want dirty gay blood. Hope patch update doesn’t take long download 🤣 Haha, mom makes sound like baby!!

I’m sure get soon too. Trust it’s sunshine roses lol drill month wild. know, *not good*. Permanent masks seems direction California heading in. *not good all.* death rate total deaths due Coronavirus higher United States Brazil. would totally unethical US divert vaccine production Brazil US serious coronavirus outbreak Brazil epidemic US control.

Biden already stated sufficient vaccine ensure general vaccinations US excess supply given nations need, morally correct policy. schools air conditioning (for office staff). one friend needed blodd incoming tumor surgery donated without thinking.

Hospital clean health protocols effectively people never leave home giving blood could anything nit exactly severe common az people never test positive, yet definitely infected. negative tests don’t mean much cases. I’m sure Brazil would listened US actually helped get doses. Problem countries like Brazil production capacity “western vaccines” taken orders US, UK EU. one [spread chinese think best hope people end wearing masks arent feeling great. think fine Germany etc wait much expensive vaccines. right. hope means poorer nations jump queue much less expensive (sold cost) Oxford vaccine. know word “cure” means? Lol. I've never school AC. Fake news probably PCR positive. got mild case back October tested antibodies January results came back positive.
I know friend Peru worse symptoms mild pneumonia antibodies. Ah 82 year old mom second said big deal always tuff.

Good you. bit jealous Aus. wife got one immuniser. political union countries waging strange PR war AZ months ones keep issues it. 

Stop spreading bullshit conspiracy theories.

1. zero benefit EU using AZ vaccine approval. faster vaccination goes, safer happier citizens faster economic recovery be.
2. Norway even part EU, neither Iceland, also suspended vaccinations. 
Some EU countries also suspended vaccinations, many not.
3. European Medicines Agency (an EU agency) says vaccine continue used, since benefits larger risks. sound like political PR decision... Look man, there's waiting list weeks long get vaccine, want it, fine, let someone else shot. There's nearly enough vaccine go around even worry, people want already fight get it. stopped past... Sure, that's factor. antibodies wane too. Tests almost certainly going miss cases lower titers higher levels. Someone COVID back March/April last year might negative test. would expect much bigger impact sampling.

Sampling would much bigger concern lower overall levels seroprevalence. course extreme sampling bias could always yield wildly different estimates, hard-pressed find self-selected, large-n cohort less than, say, 10% SARS-COV-2 infections today. That's much higher overall rate COVID cases (confirmed) population , still missed vast majority asymptomatic mild cases. hand, lab-confirmed prevalence like 4-5%, would pretty easy find large groups near 0%. r/lethallifeprotips... kind oxymoron rigorously pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Rite aid) checking eligibility requirements? I’ve heard conflicting info county county Im sorry grandma going through, selfish all. Get vaccine; working around people it. Imagine dongle vaccine... *shudders* brave Fatigue several hours after.

103 fever fatigue day after.

99-100 fever 2 days post, though otherwise felt fine.

No fever 72 hours post.



Arm also sore 3 days.

Overall terrible. heard 30 million US citizens tested positive Covid reality, number much, much higher, considering US citizens Covid tested.  Fresno County, ask proof. check box options saying eligible. it. whole process took less 20 minutes, waiting shot. Everyone else know Fresno asked show proof. check ID insurance. Don’t blame us blame government. 

We aren’t giving away releasing domestically produced vaccines every American chance receive one. Moderna, Moderna 360, Moderne One Nothing wrong except global Pandemic. Supply there, Newsom holding back counties, 50% Shoutout Trekkies!! ""deaths"". One person diagnosed multiple sclerosis, deemed unrelated vaccine. Another diagnosed transverse myelitis, find fine. Sunday like US etc reporting low numbers conciled Monday.

There's almost vaccination done Sundays (as perplexing pandemic) numbers see Monday alone. makes sense, article seemed state completely new production line finished. Hopefully three Swiss lines soon enough countries get deliveries vaccine. found breakdown Mississippi vaccinations tonight state website ones called quasi ineffective, 8% effective suitable 65s? Yeh, cutting noses spite face. rigorously pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Rite aid) checking eligibility requirements? I’ve heard conflicting info county county Wait, pay donate blood US? Btw, know modern numbers initial roots that, ""gotta go shit die feeling right (after?) pandemic hit. YOLO"" Technically inject site interested cases, like tumors push get vaccinated people donate, late since people vaccinated within months anyway? countries follow Israel's actions. Northeastern US here- vaccine uptake high people trust Moderna much Pfizer. Might Moderna made locally, dunno. Donating blood total win/win situation. save lives also allow body rejuvenate new blood. Plus, get lil buzz too. countries received doses EU based plants far know, worst case scenario could well batch related issue. 10 millions vaccinations UK never blood clotting cases looked like ours.
The current investigation shouldn’t bearing vaccine approval US. Yes, appear article says... course random sample, antibodies wane time too. effect almost certainly weighs sampling.

My interpretation would (approximately) 20% good estimation lower bound population COVID. wife got Pfizer vaccine 0 side effects either injection. Maybe her, hear Pfizer easier body Moderna. Haha, I’m kidding. thinking since got one shot stuff floating now. Kinda dreading second one everyone says it’s bad...guy administered said got 102 fever threw day second one...lol wife got knocked weekend. Fever finally broke Sunday, getting shot Friday. 32. tests, especially early on, really inaccurate. home rapid tests like 60% effective. actual scandalous decision politicans telling us keep taking AZ, get Pfizer Moderna. 

The german health mnister said days ago keep taking AZ dont worry, cases blood clotting stopped vaccine. sure Sputnik made 2P modification spike protein

Should be. Google recombinant carrier vector delivers protein gene. synthesized S-protein incorporated cell membrane assumes required conformation. look up? best use leaches though. called ""blood letting"" works great get bad blood body sick good blood left.

Wait, no. believe anymore im curious current research it. Negative antibody tests quite common. part study company trying devise antibody test. several couples study, partners sick time usually one sicker other. uncommon sicker partner test negative antibodies less ill one, case husband. sick, O2 95 needed inhaler 6 weeks, little fever slept week. UK press sometimes seems like gets called Oxford headlines it’s good news, AstraZeneca it’s bad news, lol. WARN TAKE FUCKING VACCINES EXPERIMENTING HUMAN LIVES.

I think normal people would sympathetic struggles, also spreading crazy dangerous conspiracy theories. 

Why would example proof allegation rhe vaccine causes condition describing? think someone believe cases? that's prove this. take meds high blood pressure, I'm well. (Don't want accidently lower BP critically ill people.) childhood friend active military. asked going get vaccine since offering base. response, “What point, think already back August anyway (never tested sick 2 months telling everyone allergies continued work). Covid already door anyway don’t know shot body. I’d love covid could spread troops show ain’t damn thing worry about.” 

He really shown true colors past four years, final straw me. smokes, drinks, dip, eats 7-11 food daily. Yet doesn’t want vaccine body. beyond sad. 

My younger siblings Mother also gone route friend. Q supporters way. telling yesterday Trump taking White House back day now. past year made reconsider close friendships family around. booked Pfizer local hospital, parents got it. researched decided cancel Walmart JJ tomorrow ahead time. finished stuff hospital paper work tonight. I’ll get go lay parents dinner afterwards. yeah, change plans. entire work getting Pfizer...but I’m contract couldn’t get in. parents Pfizer 2 months ago, issues. that’s it. feel better anyway going hometown, real hospital vs Walmart anyways. Stay safe friend dont want to. Everyone access vaccine, authorities basically begging get one. people fears it. Different vaccine would definitely get Pfizer Moderna vaccine AZ day position hope happened family never happened others don’t want bad anyone go family going right understand hurts world shut us nice clear want I’ll don’t give .Mad cow disease lay dormant (at time estimated) 25 years body, want risk giving disease knows many people far know problem US. sure, case makes sense. 90% people got vaccinated jab die. 

a person died italy seized batch around 400.000 vaccines. that's roughly 0.00025%. looked countries, assumption numbers much different.

of course investigate issue. important safety people, well trust vaccine overall. bit odd vaccines (Pfizer i'm mistaken) also issues. halting AZ means lot people die COVID unable get vaccinated. think main argument lots people making, including myself. sure positive Covid19. Obviously one verify truth story, true sorry hear happened.

But truth say, 30-40% people know AstraZeneca vaccine came fever bad migraines 12 hours after. fine though couple days rest plenty paracetmol.

I know anyone though came ill taking pfizer one. Greece we're looking potentially similar situation cases drop. problem people going stay inside another Easter. riots article asks weird question answer it.

""Why people worried?"" People worried governments' decided pause distribution vaccine health concerns media propagating concern risks. That's it. 

""Why governments took action"" different question Completely asymptomatic. gets better. ARC updated app showed history donations. first time tested positive antibodies August 2020. get antigen test *after* antibody test?! mean? many people without noticing? mean point whole thing might disappear virus can't find anyone live anymore? Guys never SCIT therapy?Dupixent?
Donated blood? 46 year old vaccinated American complaining country's rollout?

Compared world really well worst sooner most.

All said, USA far bigger Israel, naturally going take little longer. Arab Israelis got vaccines like citizens. higher hasitation rates still, majority adults got vaccinated. Reported. something worth considering, shows countries fact clones other. Oh, well also makes sense.

21 percent non vaccinated exposed coronavirus, 21 percent already got first shot. means nearly %42 percent start gain immunity virus. think herd immunity %70 percent, US reach herd immunity %50 percent population get two shot vaccine. guess date July 4, Biden get greater popularity announce independence day. correct. least experience things producing vaccines larger scale. seems lacking bit Oxford / Astrazeneca.

Which public? Norway needed order preserve trust vaccines. done, doubt scepticism would roof. Key word *feel* sick. I’m saying Texas anything wrong, I’m saying fact case numbers low means whatever want mean. There’s really rush vaccinate countries like China there’s little community spread. eaten (it 9am). normally eat breakfast, though. ate granola bar way home, think helped. conspiracy theory peddling here? fact they're hospital makes feel even better broader problem vaccine. would concerned popping everywhere; one hospital indicates could factors causing problems. FEMA vaccination distribution centers great job. Even 1-in-a-million serious health risk (and that's big if),


Norways number, clots connected vaccine, 4 cases 120 thousand vaccinated people. 1 every 30 000. 


In norway there's 650 deaths, 10 50. suddenly got weird blood clots can't explain right health personel vaccinated, killing 2 people 50 2 people fighting lives. 



I think symptoms timing insane coincidence. 



And people dying thousands delay vaccinations two weeks. 




If something kill it, people need informed risks. Openness key. essentially indirectly condemning thousands die virus technicality.


This also ridiculous thing I've ever seen.. come on, behave. Aww someone's oil money get high standard living once? Boo hoo. God wish Norwegian though. abundance caution case link. Something would need investigated something definitive could said subject. Though, I've read far, incidence blood clotting irregularities vaccine rate without vaccine.

Anecdotal sure think masks airflow might important arbitrary measurement. 😂 got rite aid branded band aid pamphlet. even full color glossy pamphlet. Literally zero swag whatsoever.

But got two shots Moderna, guess I'm okay it. Random question I’m getting Pfizer first dose week — eat before? Sometimes get feeling experience, especially empty stomach. understand saying makes US look terrible world stage. world concludes Biden Trump, US looks itself. Restrictions still exist majorly reduced. Schools yet back full capacity, large events still exist. However, many things open now, gyms, restaurants hotels (which serve food often small shows), vaccinated people (though places like gyms restaurants well enforced). Mask mandates still up, see people start wearing masks less less tbh despite especially open spaces. Schools session reduced classes depending grade necessarily meet every day. also common entire classes dismissed week single kid sick entire class ends going quarantine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s gonna conservative states first. reasons two fold. 

1. Vaccine hesitancy higher right leaning populations. 

2. governor says “anyone get shot”, political cover (not scientific) rush reopening landlords businesses want. Virus damned. think it’s vaccine available moment SinoPharm one everyone wants western ones.  And? People aren’t going get tested don’t feel sick. point, fast vaccine coming in. We'll see week pfizer doubles shipment accelerate rollout accordingly. Montreal started appointments 65+. seems like overreaction, something consider already-existing hesitancy. Produced different places. 

Additionally, cover different timeframes. latest yellow card report covers time 28th February, Danish Norwegian reports date. People fun? happens get J&amp;J get another vaccine Moderna? Asking friend. imagine happen?!? really good reading people lol swear saw recent video woman galveston getting arrested wearing mask tho got to. big hindu nationalists...of vourse new wrinkle herd immunity. 3 cases exact hospital seem odd you? talking entire pool 350 million. know statistically significant. many central vein thromboses heard vaccines? continue dangerous vaccine unforgivable. Y'all got anymore that, uh, first generation coronavirus vaccine? wear n95 underwear make sure farts don’t spread covid like Dr. ding says Compared number people qualify, appointments doses still quite sparse, better places worse others. SIL stalked websites like crazy help older parents in-laws get appointments, multiple hours day. Finally many weeks, either first dose finished. getting easier. think possible adults want get vaccinated, finished end May. little capacity week. I'm volunteering well-run clinic, staffed 16 medical volunteers per day 36 non-medical--we 3000 shots week get vaccine need. done US (total) week 11 million. figure like 30 million week would needed get everyone 2 doses end May, somewhat fewer significant J&amp;J doses given. bottom line is: patient, help anyone know tech-challenged transportation issues. No, it’s logical, safe. EU struggling rollout. bad thing UK running longer. vaccine. data. see similar declines countries much lower vaccination rates. Look Florida. Also basically fully open, cases declining well without nearly high vaccination rate. 

I'm saying vaccine working... similar declines cases positivity rate also observed places. can't conclude vaccine responsible decline. might responsible decline, also might declined without vaccine too. Air border currently 3 day hotel requirement. Ground 15 day minimum stay Covid test entry, entry entry proof quarantine plan. new requirements put place mid-February. familiar rules they’ve quite lax previously. extremely unlikely 3 young healthy people living area bizarre brain bleeds labs indicate DVT standard ""blood clot"". 

Vaccinate 359 million people weird things happen.

You look cases isolation think ""this weird must explanation"" look 359 million vaccinations bunch 1-in-a-million chance events expected commonly occurred now. know. data collected reviewed. I've extremely stringent behavior avoiding virus entirety last year. far worked. long term damage factor concerns I'm striving avoid form. 

If J&amp;J (possibly) less effective preventing mild cases others (again know nothing definitive) dont mind waiting extra week 2 3 conditions find somewhere gives Pfizer Moderna. God knows I'm used point they're profit company. might making money directly vaccine mean they're making money indirectly. free advertising absolute least. I’m pretty sure there’s neighborhoods citizens living Mississippi. know NY big state, city delay state wide changes. South Park explains well get vaccinated urgency relatively low number cases have. Asia pretty well except Japan extent, Korea lesser extent. comparing events reported expected amount general population,. remember vaccinated population much higher risk dvt's etc due age risk 
Men, 130 per 100,000 per year Women, 110 per 100,000 per year That’s 10 per month per 100,000 That’s 120 per million per month Therefore 3 million population 360 thromboembolic events expected per month number relate single batch/facility different problem Automod bit trouble.

Any comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned. definitely younger people getting back January/February we're point right supply needs really matter gets it. Personally, I'm 20's already covid I'm going wait group eligible, case think worth getting FL opened another eligibility group well. anyone know why, 10 years research mRNA vaccines, single one come market one? people spoke basically cited concern them. never requirement hotel crossing land border. Try again. You’re right, damn politicians [one leading German medical realize got less supply compared population. get info? Cases already done lmfao.  Georgia also gotten screwed received side. Connecticut received doses 46% get one shot. Ohio 40%. Georgia 37%. ran Georgia since bottom list. Ohio middle. Connecticut right top. get first vaccine available unless difference time get trivial (and even caveat “we don’t even know whether two trials reasonably compared!”). talking marginal differences. much greater source concern spending time awaiting exposure without kind protection, rather standing around wringing hands “the absolute theoretical best.” They’ll save life.

If you’re scared Covid, get protected soon possible. Think way; JNJ choice available would even *hesitate* get first opportunity? sure hell shouldn’t prolong exposure needlessly get vaccine seems slightly higher top line efficacy paper different conditions (top line isn’t everything.). Paralysis choice.

Public health experts pretty much unanimous — get first one can. Im assuming are. I’d love enlighten new wave hit US like Europe due “opening soon like Europe “ thanks sharing J&amp;J next weeks hopefully fix that. also hope CDC creates allotment rule states administering less 50-60% doses get anymore get 70%. one want vaccine states, go places actually want it. Tf? Canadian wish felt like altering DNA. 

**MAKE STOP, AAHHHH**  Perhaps one wait actual look Norwegian Danish findings, one dismisses them? give number Germany. seven now. Seven cases 1.7m vaccinated people. halt warranted. always consideration benefit/risk ratio. Even Special forms vein thromboses, happen normal population. seven cases large number subjects definitely put many people risk many die without need. Also, low number cases, small number random events cause statistics basically fail. Combine re-opening despite rising numbers got fine mixture disaster. know people appointments driving? Vaccine passports thing fake vaccination papers live less 30 minutes Peace Arch crossing. really want go Seattle weekend. think anyone saying require masks flu season. normalize people wearing general, give bit encouragement others, especially travelling high impact areas like public transportation. I'm sure good would look say ""hey going use they're killing citizens let's give Africa"" took 'four' Health Ministers months stalled negotiations. What’s point mask restaurant? Seems silly. 80% American population wants vaccine, far last threshold herd immunity. absolutely need concerned.  TIL, data outside UK exist unscientific. I’m predicting easing restrictions early Memorial Day weekend vaccinated either side border, though late June likely. Probably select major crossings first well. would love sick days count vacation days. Abbott lifted mandate last Wednesday. expect spikes happen another week least.

Look, want pandemic end like everyone else - faking win going cut it. see everyone sub downvotes realistic comments upvotes wishful thinking. Nothing frustrating living state prematurely reopening cases finally going down. 

The article posted PRECISELY need stick mandate truly safer reopen... Could particular batch? extremely unlikely 3 young healthy people living area bizarre brain bleeds labs indicate DVT standard ""blood clot"". would ridiculous least make sure occurred due chance. OH.

MY.

You know ""liberal"" one meaning, right? Why? no, cool *not* enforce mandate (which really suggestion way worded)

tarrant dallas counties tried stricter lockdown/mask stuff right original shelter place lifted, ag paxton, who, indictments aside, really guilty loving freedom, took court stripped local officials freedom make local public health decisions

if remember right shit el paso using refrigerated trucks rolling morgues Putting aside scare, seems nothing, wonder still using AZ vaccine. converted factories J&amp;J come vaccinate twice faster AZ basically useless S. Africa variant.  let cities make decision based local conditions?

Texas government likes allow cities make decisions long decision aligns Republicans want, otherwise illegal Abbot sue. hates Austin, incredibly liberal city that, given right make laws, pisses Abbot anything else. That's essentially Republican party operates. That's certainly fair critique, even cases relatively rare amongst set coagulopathies reported AZ vaccine. That's roughly 3 millions.

I've *all for* America's plan holding domestically produced vaccines focus people first, even though I'm Canadian policy clearly bad us.

But America holding vaccine even approved (when countries currently administering approved long time ago), ramp (and withholding) vaccines enough meet far exceed previous targets... that's little much me.  Shut vaccination hospital would call. Sure open investigation vaccine well.

The bad call stopping vaccination completely. simply evidence compared risk life stopping vaccine accomplishes. agree.

but article about. vaccine getting? really good catching bandits days umm...I did.

Can't wait!! report deaths then?  ~exactly~ Canada and...we're nearing 5% single vaccination doses. :/

Good Chile though. thing I've heard can't remember vaccine medication specifically, maybe polio vaccine first came out? caused severe birth defects, I'm kids so... guess months anxiety I'll a-ok! 😅 can't believe it... 19-year-old guy got first Pfizer dose. stand-by list leftover doses, got called. used numbers npr site.

I know plural anecdote data, among every heterosexual couple know who's vaccinated, woman worse side effects.

2. Fatality rate unprotected far lower current rate calculated using last year. Majority vulnerable population (or within weeks) protection. unvaccinated population skew closer flu like levels fo fatality (for kids Covid far less lethal flu example) hear. mean countries can't afford stop rollout evenly distributed chance sign additional agreements Austrian Chancellor alluded to?

Nah. antibodies wane time convert T-Cells undercounting absolutely happens antibody study. 

Problem it’s inexact science. may antibodies couple months, others could year more.

But there’s sure people antibody study like COVID say 6+ months ago longer active antibodies ignoring advice EMA.

Nothing quoted wrong.

Although I'm sure scientists trust case, lean towards say keep vaccinating. Moderna actually started research goal using mRNA vaccines treat cancer, huge leap forward.

Fauci could been, definitions, ""cautious"" saying 'we think vaccine may provide mucosal immunity', made mention even broad statement, thus idea vaccines provide mucosal immunity ought labeled conspiracy theory proven then, he's previously confessed lying public herd immunity, get us best behavior.

""And guns completely banned take point"" Yeah see trying argue here. bans many. enormous amount banned there. Even far many here, still want more. 

I'm also sure trying argue end. understand government nothing, right? I've said, Government necessary evil restricted minimized much possible. engage strawman, no.

You really convince could ever tolerate living there. things I've seen government things want, really simple. everyone agree you, man. Fauci Biden say US won’t totally back normal possibly next Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci Thursday said post-pandemic return ""normal"" could come end year, aligning forecast Christmas target U.S. President Joe Biden set earlier would call normalized summer r/coronavirus pie sky pipe summer many people don’t hold slow rates reach saturation.

And how’s relying people right thing gone past year? what's point? help exactly? sure help retail workers hear new bullshit excuses anti maskers. sure going help drive infection rate down. likely preventing dropping could study peer reviewed. Fauci said interview asymptomatic spread possible mucosal immunity (can spread coughing, sneezing, etc.) (source: ). Would like timestamp says that? saying lack evidence far study came showed new evidence.

www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/11/pfizer-covid-vaccine-blocks-94percent-of-asymptomatic-infections-and-97percent-of-symptomatic-cases-in-israeli-study.html Canadians win Stanley Cup every year :P Enough concerned. sure mean proof. Thanks! wondering variances. Novavax J&amp;J/Janssen may also come short. US like 50 different countries, depending state availabilities state people may take whatever get. late Summer better data order make better decisions also know need 6-month boosters 1 year boosters. Wow southern state give fuck. Unlike Arkansas Redditors: “No” Ummmm...except USA chosen help *WORLD* (Biden made mention strategic geopolitical vaccine deployments)...once finish vaccinating themselves, months. fuck Brazil, shit pandemic response? New York Times try holding Balsonaro accountable - Brazilians putting - rather trying depict like sort hapless Trump zombie capability inclination act differently. 

PS - Brazil ordered 100M Pfizer vaccines. Took long enough. Virginia super slow despite people crossing state lines get vaccine. know several people work offices qualify “essential” work certain industry. Virginia high numbers use way they’re distributing joke Yeah many scientists pointed use blood donors representative sample reason infection levels Manaus, Brazil may badly overestimated last fall. different country though could imagine opposite true people committed enough public health donate blood would likely wear masks keep distance well. America unfortunately still new cases per day Canada gets month. source that? sources back COVID vaccines proven prevent spread, proven provide mucosal immunity may create asymptomatic carriers 

 study published [*Journal Allergy Clinical Immunology*](http://jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(20)31623-7/fulltext) November shows people recover natural Covid-19 infections develop antibodies protect mucosal regions respiratory tract, **but evidence yet true vaccine-induced immunity**. (links JACI article: ). Since scientists haven’t yet found evidence vaccines provide mucosal immunity, someone vaccinated symptoms illness may carrying live SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading others cough, breath : ""The vaccine 100% effective still know someone vaccinated develop asymptomatic infection transmit virus""

Can provide evidence back claims, would contradict findings Journal Allergy Clinical Immunology, Johns Hopkins? No, thank putting big list together ! Lol, politicized rest world deal shit able get here. Yeah took 600k dead people scientific breakthroughs get here. Also, let's ignore infection rate would likely even lower signal sent.

If there's one thing painfully obvious, material amount public get take credit this. LOL thank much! Sending lots prayers Brazil! happen even need explain proven imply ""are real"" though. smarter pause small amount time ENSURE problem rather assume ""it's unlikely"" ""we found anything day half we've looked this.""

I'm sure nothing's wrong things resume couple days, supply count shifted due doses unused opposed thrown away, therefore real impact herd immunity reached. ^ underrated comment. Personally I’m hoping one done, I’d take J&amp;J choice. Full disclosure I’m pretty healthy covid waaaaay back early April 2020. (Couple exposures since reinfection, it’s almost year take whatever vaccine available I’m eligible.) good ole people dumb think themselves. Like wearing masks makes vulnerable people people touch face? Kansas say May 1. insane also good problems solved bombing that's much shorter list usually creates whole new problem. structure India different US? judges get involved things belong executive branch US? believe problem Brazilian strain.. Yes EU prioritise people’s safety. continue better vaccines like Pfizer prioritising people’s safety? Australia New Zealand would like word there's study israel says pfizer 95% effective preventing asymptomatic infections, means odds transmission incredibly unlikely. Moderna tech, figures ballpark.  Antibodies last blood certain amount time. Immunity moves T-cells. really proves nothing. link Hong Probably keep mind first shot thing weeks get it. would make feel pretty silly got covid finish line, I'm thinking I'll wait till 3 weeks first shot go out, past good go  comment linking medium.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* state tiers reopen, governor isn’t following them. anybody still doubts vaccine gotten simply nervous to?

Might ask why? Right using data untrustworthy country produced order gauge merits. N-O politics certain countries end killing populations, wont need many. AZ save lives vaccine. difference? seem based moral assumptions well qualified make. disagree, mostly personal experience. 

My 73 y/o grandparents unable snag appointment two weeks now. (I've constantly searching).

Once get shot, I'll ready open up. Boosters seem like reasonable precaution perhaps next years parts world remain largely unvaccinated. think read like roguhly 55% Pfizer, Moderna gf got told 60%. ever going end, it? call Dr. Doom. always feel scared listen him. J&amp;J also sold cost. anyway. Thanks answering.
My confusion still around increasing. WBC eliminate foreign substance quickly? doubt. Lets say 60 days viral vector introduced still body? causes increase immunity 60 days 90 days? slippery slope violent criminals actually put rehabilitation program help commit violent crimes. prison system retribution profit, fair punitive action someone something wrong society. 

I know unapologetic unreachable murderers sex criminals though. everyone deserves second chance society, although everyone deserves adequate medical treatment, prison.  nobody blame tell people EU see BS day demand governments explain themselves. (You may want define ""seroprevalence"" readers.) know found 3 masks Wyoming picture. r/MurderedByWords There’s lot wannabe scientists sub discussed  Maryland pls new South Park made fun usual top way think it’s going shake way. People going go crazy summer fun way. Super Bowl Valentines Day come gone without massive waves. 

Most places still lockdowns ,. ?

I mean.. I'm arguing (we see huge upward spikes).. also think that's accurate indicator. 

Nationwide vaccination progress good (great!).. fully expect cases keep trending down,. think ""social spread"" something continue cognizant (and absolutely think we'll see isolated ""hot spots"" social spread. 

How plays bigger picture, really know. Younger people less risk,. 0 risk. fully expect we'll continue see Covid-deaths 2021. far drop ?.. know. new Sony TV? I'm jealous. hear you, hear you. whole immediate family gotten shots, idea I'll even qualify one. Take downstate.

The rural communities gotten ton vaccines they're taking them.  spent hour got appointment next day Danville.

Check sign walgreens account whoever getting burn hour copying pasting zip codes. get one eventually.

Start early, think start getting new signups like 6 something like that. Oh I'm I'm saying anyone's lying, say ""where's lie? Spoiler any"" meant anyone looking conspiracy theory none either side is. take blame wording weird way.

I agree you, truly unfortunate situation, deaths people. think attributing strange death without seeing pattern data even providing information suggest there's issue reckless reporting(which bbc report saying said norwegians said well, average incidence blood clots vs non vaccinated population rare unusual occurrence). times misinformation, misquotes mistrust science medicine rampant every day society, think reporting caution what's terribly reckless headlines sometimes even reflect information articles. think actions fit, situation could handled better considering vaccines similar claims laid specifically, pfizer, that's opinion.

As trials think that's standard, issues AZ number participants age groups? smallest trials. Pfizer moderna roughly 20,000 people group(vaccine placebo) vs 12,000 per group AZ, trials done across multiple countries multiple ethnic groups AZ pfizer done across 4 countries Jand J done across 8 including south africa parts trial concluding december boat data fully out. pfizer AZ started trials may iirc concluded around October want say news vaccines started breaking around November anyway really issue. efficacy issue started german minister misinterpreting preliminary data, imo honest mistake also warrant back forth pettiness that's going on. really know what's going Dutch factory report now.

And yeah normally overly transparent would boost confidence trust read room, people already shunning AZ initial efficacy gaff even though fully clarified still boosted confidence (in european countries least) reports back forth factories vaccine supply (which AZ struggling meet) adds mistrust band misinformation probably end wasted vaccines wasting hundreds millions dollars, prolonging already deadly pandemic. Yep, that's France. Stopping vaccinations going cause lot deaths stop, even AZ vaccine causes blood clots 0.0006% (or whatever). logic ‘one death many’ ranting suspicion vaccine. Yeah bit confusing sites/companies what. Hope helps EU doses. ""literally"" lol.

That's complete inaccurate BS even ""literally"" pretty similar Pfizer discussing, apparently. Ohio Oregon California can't?? Pharmaceutical companies bad batches. They're made strictest manufacturing conditions Earth, ""bad batch"" thing pure nonsense. Thursday think. six individuals younger middle-aged women

So perhaps AZ used 65's. 65's EU's current policy opposite correct one. sensible attitude here, far I'm concerned.

Pfizer worked must absolutely insane, breakneck speed year stages involved developing, producing distributing brand new vaccine middle global crisis.

And they're *still* saying they'll continue sell current price / jack price we're officially pandemic, phase recurring seasonal problem (like flu) etc.

Why hell make money efforts, point? pharmaceutical company winning product.

I buy generic brand acetaminophen, buy Tylenol. Tylenol's expensive, choose brand probably slightly superior product. say that? takes 4-6 weeks see outcome super spreader events first place. nothing unscientific except one wishing ignore facts realities. Heheheh. Hey Lois! I’m opening vaccine eligibility adults Mississippi  vaccines “better” don’t need cold storage, need one shot, don’t need needles mist refuse root Ohio sports teams, spent lot money Cedar Point, qualify me? haven’t covid (knock wood) can’t speak specifically, I’ve noticed thing colds I’ve before. Kinda hard describe definitely know I’m coming something start noticing would strongly agree /u/RTPGiants .. wish States would announce publish specific metrics instead saying ""Meh,. guess (hand-wavy).. we're good !?"".. 

That tiered restriction levels (green, yellow, red, etc).. ramped up.. tiered ramp ?.. would logical thing do. first thought also, ""Damn Ohio, always trying upstage us!"" people worried safe, they'll reject vaccine. Better take time show people doubts taken seriously. know going stuff life, thread literally quotes national health authority flat stating decision political stating benefit/risk ration widely positive.

But still can't name them? Everyone agrees true number 1/3, evidence everyone agrees it.  even know it’s safe them? 

0 long term studies vaccinated 3 months max... early tell. agree then, yeah. “just” anxiety doesn’t mean it’s big deal, point guess.

I can’t think non-anxiety based reason vaccine cause relief symptoms. it’s caused remnant viral infection vaccine isn’t going produce significantly higher immune response virus, it’s caused remnant immune damage would expect vaccine effect. I’m really curious see figure common allover world, masks nose.... Debile.. *except one little thing able decide vaccine safe. Pfizer? mean Biontech. developed vaccine funded German tax money. extra doses come German plant produced Biontech. can't US currently use AstraZeneca? FDA yet given EUA. waiting results additional Phase 3 trial. Ok well lines better. Conservatives want industry manufacture, government funded. Government provides incentives industry like tax breaks. often enough overcome cheaper manufacturing costs abroad. baby need vax Covid? 

Look data. Young kids beyond highly unlikely get harmed Covid. thousands times likely harmed flu. People keep saying sort thing [as 3,280,000 kids diagnosed COVID since start pandemic, representing 13% Like, allowed pretend schools somehow part that, need pretty convincing data. argument, need show strong correlation is. simple fact Brazil better Latin American countries similar demographics, doubt there's strong correlation there.

Chile's average age 33 better ratio Brazil. 

Brazil awful, even trying handle pandemic.

2nd worst deaths/million SouthAmerica

Vietnam, another Tropical jungle country 35 total COVID deaths. Brazil hand 35 deaths every 20 minutes

in BRICS worst numbers, even compared giants like China India, Brazil alone half deaths BRICS bloc. say so?

sure must be, less total deaths less suffering anything. heartbreaking. Everyday see news countries moving forward Brazil keeps hitting record deaths. feel like we've stopped time :( Oh totally agree - think crimes punishable prison time asinine. worry getting slippery slope saying people commit drug-related crimes inherently better makes easier other-ize violent criminals deprive basic needs. thought perception AZ vaccine low there

This severely misrepresented English language media. number people would use Astrazeneca lower number wanted get vaccinated still majority people far bigger percentage population percentage AZ vaccines government bought. Cooke reiterated however number thromboembolic events reported vaccinated people ""seems higher seen general population"" watchdog remains ""firmly convinced benefits AstraZeneca vaccine preventing COVID-19, associated risk hospitalisation death, outweigh risks side effects."" nationalised health service significantly leverage standard consumer. Starting get vaccine FOMO. Please microchip me. Excellently strong word interesting choice Damn michiganders. :)

Kidding course. Good news around! fair trade. guys come get shots long keep going get weed. literally comment subreddit removed month two back suggesting thing. officially obligated finish now:

O-H first AZ shot yesterday morning. long left? Thank you! read article? here. I'm Canadian American roommates. They'll getting vaccinated second go home summer, probably even vaccinated time school starts fall. agree probably nothing bad batch, idea bad batches almost impossible far true.

Pretty much every factory/production facility world food/clothes/books/anything mass produced follows 'processes procedures' try eliminate mistakes. Faulty batches still happen. Unless auditor/QA constantly watching, corners get cut, things get missed, batch control counters lose calibration ect.

I could completely wrong, every place I've ever worked same. Humans fail. Machines fail. I'm district 2 cases essentially means automatic 10 day shutdown whole school. Basically kids really actually confined classes. take bus, meet every morning cafeteria, share hallways, bathrooms, etc. Even kids class we're going get shutdown. funny keep hearing covid spread schools. Us teachers obviously know better. course does. Nationalising healthcare creates enormous single customers far greater price negotiation power though.

The absolute objectively weakest part US healthcare system terrible value money 'customer' gets. Paywalled Yeah, think 3-day view give you. Get bright early tomorrow morning tonight midnight. think see another major spike? Hospitalizations overwhelmed again? Sooo... 2 months then. That’s random, unscientific timeline you. government run/public funded vaccine manufacturer Canada, 1980s conservative government decided partially privatize instead, resulted eventually sold French company. Womp womp.

Like said, ones I've scheduled friends/family required bit drive. Luckily issue them, see problem many elderly. subject discussing ability vaccine work. got perception nation created? Nothing. evaluated merits, using scientific method. gonna ""Where Alabamia"" learned that's actually they're called. Weird. It’s polarised many people don’t seem able accept life death decisions taken political and/or commercial reasons, despite overwhelming evidence that’s exactly what’s happening. Antibodies don’t last long. get infection immune system beaten before, create antibodies. Also early versions antibodies test pretty iffy. I’d go gut probably get it.

For me, actions speak louder words. Nobody stopping EU buying vaccines multitude suppliers earlier.

By time even realized going on.. virus already ""4 14 days"" ahead us. (if longer,. probably circulating US since Dec Jan)

Convincing people ""do right thing **BEFORE** problem arises"".. notoriously difficult thing do. like trying convince people ""save rainy day"" ""eat healthier get heart-disease 30 years now."".

Luckily competition that’ll force keep somewhat reasonable think missed point statement, many got clots covid-19 lot responses.

The question many clots vaccines.

I agree Facebook bad, society individuals. cost humanity stock value lost productivity, spread extremism, depression, maladies causes. Germany doesn’t postpone vaccine. Disregarding advice majority medical scientific community continue vaccinating isn’t necessity. It’s choice. bad one. could work. One would hand-post physical flyers spread word mouth old ladies checking grocery store They're dishonest. Nothing dropping like stone Israel except percent positive. I'm anti-vax - recently bullied elderly father appointment really want go - clear evidence vaxxing makes difference county-wide population level reaches herd immunity, especially considering vax rates Israel evenly spread throughout population. Yea, Reddit generally hates rural black people poor white people, based general disdain Alabama Mississippi. putting fear public get vaccinated. going much harm cost lives.

I disagree. think social media, people expertise shadow experts this. spread fear doctors say ""trust us"".

By halting vaccine, take away path misinformation. say ""out abundance caution, we've removed vaccine might cause issue *in favor of* vaccines reputation tarnished"".

Yes, reduce number vaccines currently available, maintain confidence vaccines have. Shift AZ production one vaccine quantity rebound.

Fighting arguing saving AZ gives fuel fire that's burning decades: people trust experts. need play long game. Believe I’m im fox fan apologist... actually promote idea virus hoax network? Insulin? US anyway. problem! also added COVID last September. bit worried cuz heard 2nd dose worse tested positive past, that's experience. Yes. agree. Though urban area (Cleveland) lit like christmas tree every morning, urban appointments fill quickly. Wolstein center downtown tons slots available now.

For people living Cleveland area age range 50-59, driving 30-40 minutes outside city also big deal.

That map BTW found vaccine slots 5 older acquaintances larges urban area Ohio week. long transportation, plenty spots available. homebound w/ transportation admittedly difficult. ""they make vaguely data minded people feel better""

Its ""feels"" though. I'm arguing exact opposite that. (outcomes driven statistical facts). 

If certain locality say:.. ""If new infections drop 50% Hospitalizations drop 25%,. we'll open X-public activities increase Restaurant capacity X-percent."" 

At least way giving people exact numbers work with. US, none us ever really lockdown- I'm 

Americans think wearing mask Walmart ""lockdown"" find currently hospitalized nowadays? can't find link CDC site anymore *Cries Canada we’ve vaccinated 8% population still 80+ plus* current curfew restrictive last lockdown (it wasn’t restrictive tbh). Maybe they’ll hard lockdown like last March done months ago people exhausted dumb 6PM curfew, doubt people respect losing patience. Oh well. part? I'm definitely liberal/libertarian side things, I've found people like quick reopening (or restrictions begin with).

I like idea favor I'm somehow aligning political party basically abhor. Depends blood center.

It consistent. Also point believe younger people likely spread (even mild case) they're work socializing, vaccinating could reduce spread. J&amp;J. Hopefully side effects minimum. Others work said chills fatigue next day. going big! It’s milestone. spectacular, promise. Congrats! ask occupation is? provide employment proof? ""progressive"" WA claims sure slow af here. Apparently 800k sitting reserve Inslee like ""nope"" Ohioans right now. California. idea I'll eligible. localisation cases points towards bad batch genetic Go back eating candy mean, keeping 57 extra lbs probably riskier long term waiting extra month two vaccine, I'd say made good choices. They’re gonna lower one time 40+ opening everyone comical seeing pro-lockdown posters witness public support crumbling. DeWine good due Dr Acton. bunch armed protestors started gathering outside house eventually stepped position since DeWine pretty average. Get antigen test. it, one vaccine bring defenses 100%

Stress variants, important keep vaccines, ongoing thing, done. Bigger question: society none people work? Nothing, break down.

But let’s go question-by-question.

What essential workers schools shut COVID outbreaks? Probably they’ve now—put kids low-quality online classes—but two weeks. schools don’t shut fully every COVID case. quarantine infected student they’ve contact with. way schools re-opening, student contact students fairly limited.

What essential workers child comes COVID? children highly unlikely severe COVID—it’s less risk children flu. they’ll probably whatever kids get flu. need better leave policies? Yes, don’t shut school flu season.

Parents still concerned high-risk kids choose keep kids school—almost everywhere offers fully-remote option. least give parents choice. Let decide kids’ education worth COVID risk family. Keep mind essential workers prioritized vaccine.

“A pile essential worker corpses.” Well according CDC mortality statistics, 80% COVID deaths people 65. people older part age group risk. corpses retirees, essential workers. elderly people essential workers prioritized vaccines. 20%+ US received least one dose vaccine, vaccinate 2M people per day (and improving). pile essential worker corpses?

All issues discuss improvements take months years implement. Re-opening schools happen matter weeks.

At least let working class families make cost/benefit analysis themselves. choose keep kids remote send back school. don’t need paternalism. says 2.6 People business whoever makes money, likely going China long time. say like I'm vaccinating phase 2 patients pharmacy tomorrow.

There's currently tons open slots Rite-aids Seattle, Puyallup, auburn, Yakima Bellingham still open well many Brazilian? Personally believe it’s good way able make decision. genetics mother father passed offspring showed ill side affects vaccine, it’s good indicator child likely result. It’s gamble, one families willing make feels safer lot things life. people feel want contribute one way help. Denver here. Last time walked dispensary ounces sale $80 (normally $100 location). Michigan getting robbed home state Illinois hear. would anyone that? Gotta love folks sub care Covid deaths EU member states country pause vaccination program two days, never thousands appointments cancelled postponed thanks AZ Moderna missing deliveries. I'd venture say we'll never get ""dialed"" all.

Vaccinations eventually cause cases plummet we'll get worst outcome approaches, lots deaths *and* economic/psychological damage. Well 70% Wyoming's theirs, we're going metros. I'm saying ""Wyoming dense"" argument completely airtight, depends measure density. People per square mile? Sure. But, again, spread evenly.

More Wyoming...ers? Wyomingians? live largest cities Texans theirs. like everyone 500 acres. Ok please enlighten everyone good ! Finally sense nonsense mom second jab last week, felt little bit tired nothing bad. Cdc 2M reported last Wednesday though Probably mix supply logistics. 14 million people metro area, enough people slots administer faster rate. Maybe it'll keep improving. still going pretty well though, unlike month+ ago. takes time. Prices go time goes places licensed established (hopefully) ... Tell Rubio Republicans thought virus HOAX FIRST LINE get vaccine. states! 

*gestures vaguely* stuck paying shit rest life? could stop getting boosters point switch Moderna? (I bet answers questions yet, hoping anyone input.)

You get whatever one want months, married Pfizer life gave first two shots, worry that. Let's get real never good enough you. Come May another reason wait months It’s children age 12. FYI. Pfizer/Moderna J&amp;J think were, we'd hearing it.

I mean, saying know experts Germany, Denmark Norway?

In Germany, 7 people 20 40 known health issues developed brain blood clots, low blood palatels bleeding (all 3 together rare disorder, already statistically significant) 11th 15th March 3 14 days vaccination.Three died. 3 similar cases Austria 6 cases Norway (2 dead, two 30 yo healthcare workers without previous health issues). said, chance Germany Norway would suspended think something right, severely behind UK US vaccinations.

The chief physician treating patients Norway says patients responding well immunomodulating drugs, another interesting circumstance. theory vaccine induced immune response leading rare blood clot disorder would mean picked trials still bothersome. stumbled upon [this detailing 20 cases (2 deaths) Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP) US following administration Pfizer Moderna vaccines. never hint grinding vaccine programme halt little media coverage. AZ however gets dragged across coals, handful cases 15 million vaccinations.  Germany.

30 cases EEA 16? prioritizing teachers essential workers? But, but, thought remote learning keeping safe... received second Moderna dose month ago. Wife received either. mom got first shot last week.

Mom lung cancer hospital blood clot lungs. Wife moms apartment state. Would unsafe visit wife apartment overnight? going hospital anything. give wife company mom hospital.

I don’t want risk unknowingly giving wife covid gives mom comes home. obese people getting vaccine early? Obesity self-inflicted. smokers get vaccine early too? two events different causes origins? Yes.
Will consequences results? Also yes.
So far overwhelming reaction AZ Moderna stood us « They don’t want anyway! », « Hahaha losers ».
But sudden it’s Health Agency responsible postponing delaying vaccine appointments, it’s straight murder send whole EU leadership jail (even little bearing matter). Tell call nearest public library, one easy way get help signing this. Seems less effective mild cases still likely reduce severe cases Texas orders doses weekend Monday, don’t order every day. imagine many states work way - CDC provides weekly allocation, state spends day two determining providers ship to, place order weekend, leads heavy distribution early week. Cuba necessarily giving blood, already possibility seizures hand. Giving blood put stress body. Still sure what's wrong likely hitting head years something.  point. point always age best determinant negative outcomes; perfect, even 20-year-old service worker gets COVID, generally much likely suffer ill effects. 50-year-old lawyer is. talking vaccine antibody cocktail buy finished evaluating would fine states forcing people wear masks, it’s federal government would disagree it? They’ve trying get teachers medical staff finished opening everyone making difficult teachers get appointments. 

I live Bama last weekend volunteered second two vaccine clinics teachers educators. 2200 vaccines given day majority educators county wanted vaccine done shots. special Saturday clinics since teachers can’t leave middle school day easily workers can.

We people try sneak line get vaccine (and teachers brought families) given shot regardless. person didn’t get vaccine jerk end day drove past check team wouldn’t stop get form demanding shot. cops handle him. also bit silly include Russia ""Europe"".

why? almost 80% Russians live European part Russia take multivitamin easier stomach! avoid calcium try get vitamin c time, it'll increase iron absorption. Calcium inhibits iron vitamin c makes absorb better. want hear justify ending system got us vaccines one year. Cases occurred 4 12 days shot. comes average value.

Schaffner said two things impressed by.  first substantial portion US population experienced Covid, **at least blood donor population**, knowingly unknowingly. **The huge proportion US population -- 80%**,"" said. ""So can't rely strategy letting herd immunity occur naturally. We've got vaccinate order get 80% population immune."" 

Interesting guy correctly points sample reflective actual population (e.g. blood donors self selecting random), yet next statement uses 80% figure extrapolate population data accurately represent. either way, still agree ultimate conclusion need people vaccinated want chance achieving herd immunity. Noooo they're literally trying murder population Texas 1b category quite time pretty much included probably 90% population actually knew it. Obesity, heart conditions, pretty much pre-existing medical condition besides twitchy eyes. 

Then amazed people knew could sign one waiting list. Yeah seems big troll... mean 80% says correct. 80% make 100%...

There's scientific basis decision. take vaccine increase chances survival. It’s simple. “Like said proved credible source, Pfizer paid 100% development costs vaccine.

Thanks playing.”

This? press release clearly shows statement incorrect. many germans italians die this?

Stay tuned....... Might dumb question what’s I’m getting second shot, first shot, efficacy already 92% So, anti vaxxers start ramping up. heard israel harder get younger generations vaccinated. That’s true though; british variant evolved severe dumb. USA way people naturally immunized Canadians, also vaccinated much higher percentage population. Canadians problem. Oops. Yep, missing many vaccines list. missing row major variant. Eg B.1.1.7(UK), B.1.1.28(Brazil), B.1,351(SAfrica), B.1.427 (California), major new variants See /nextstrain also even altruistic endeavor. 

They using vaccine, research, design, implement, vaccinating tribes first.

Once done, vaccinating general public (so, non-tribe), kindness hearts necessarily.

It directly benefits tribes many people, tribal not, vaccinated.

It's good deed, sure, one requires thanks *certainly* conduct worthy placed pedastal like poster, saying ""deserve kindness."" I'm envious California's criteria. least make sense. states criteria (including state Georgia's) downright special ed level sense. Vaccinating parents ""high risk children"" (almost oxymoron COVID except rare illnesses/circumstances) 64 year olds? rather ramping 40+ something, open 80%+ adult population (if overweight, in!) opening all, essentially punitive 50 year old maintains good health? Absolute insanity. 

If California getting vaccines delivered (they're middle pack, answer ""yes""), they're going people typically need most. many states they're going people want most. two groups always overlap. Totally worth extra 10 day wait normal weight. moving goalposts original claim obviously untrue. made mention conspiracy theories original post, talking anyone questioning wisdom suspending AZ vaccine programmes, saying going informed opinion regulatory bodies. one it? issue conspiracies, think saying ""we suspend use AZ vaccine"" makes bad antivaxxer? That's prediction end America. Biden going beg people get shots faced conundrum. Declare victory saying achieved herd immunity continue crying please pretty please get shot clinics empty 40 percent population says thanks. scenario Biden declares victory like Michael Scott declared bankruptcy. mention Mexico think international travel might open back like 2019 level? want go Spain, Italy, Croatia, spend week each. think there’s chance maskless travel could resume summer? You’re crazy: ‘ could literally save lives everyone around you‘ nonsense. 

I’m wearing masks take pandemic seriously it’s insta death curse I’m trying get folks bring balance back judgement that? can't get directed online schedule appointment there. call? weaponization real minimal outliers bad actors like Russian trollbots. intentional panic. 

A massive emergency vaccination campaign like world attempting bound statistically insignificant downstream outliers even batch contamination. Halting vaccinations weeks could easily cost tens thousands lives more. 20% infected, 33% vaccinated. Assuming overlap, USA probably possibly 45% immunity.

The next 20% vaccinated start driving virus even more. Another 10% tge USA hit magical 70%

Obviously many assumptions calculation. True. reality many people still dying fully open up. posted months ago many people seem lost touch reality--or humanity, think life death equally good they're unimportant. Think we're seeing thread. funny watching conservative states trying signal committed death cult.

What's next? Alabama mandatory doorknob picking entering building? North Dakota Trump brand orgies city hall? sounds amazing, US get “1 gallon donor” pin 8 donations believe FYI EMA today said “more batches involved therefore unlikely batch specific event”. Could EU factory they're produced maybe? could something completely different. Odd three people hospital went Norway, example.

What seems clear problem vaccine whole: would expect see many hundreds unusual cases India UK I’m surprised lack promotion explaining vaccines mechanisms work. Giving public information “vaccines good” would go long way. correct answer. number people contract Covid Florida staggering. Yeah. Deal it, healthy weight people.  Lol! people wear mask 4 months

how **no**? Vaccinating people doesn’t prevent infections

**wrong.**

We bunch data coming Israel research institutions. looking mess Europe... despite strict lockdowns, covid-19 spreading. Looking many states new vaccination rates, cases continue fall nationwide. cases, hospitalizations. proof nationwide now, even areas hit hard winter spike, like Southern California. (edit: several well sourced articles sub blocks many URLs ridiculous.)

**VACCINES EFFECTIVELY PREVENT TRANSMISSION.** taken market far better vaccines (non-live virus) became available.

It taken market 1999. next rotavirus vaccine get approved West 2006 make sound like huge decades long coverup

My first words ""not decades"" haha, anyway I'm suggesting coverups conspiracies anything nefarious sort. fact good example postmarketing surveillance working exactly intended. People wear masks anyway lol God help us That's reasonable target high exposure groups like teachers service industry workers along high risk groups mentioned previous post.

The content post factually incorrect well presentation. sucks whatever decision / reality end people suffer. CDC estimated 1 4.6 cases reported. Let's call 1 4 even conservative. 30M cases reported 120M actually infected. That's third US population. misinformation. Germany, Italy Spain co-ordinated decision temporarily suspend Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine effort help protect public confidence, France’s industry minister said, Sweden became latest nation suspend use sign co-ordination European capitals, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi German chancellor Angela Merkel spoke Monday afternoon Italy announced suspension vaccine, people familiar matter said.

It co-ordinated. decision taken politicians. AZ none-profit vaccine. really anything lose.

I wonder UK could reason screw EU's vaccination campaign blatantly delivering contract. 🤔 Actually many legal systems similar English law letter contract matters AZ vaccine ""the UK"" ""the UK"" whole reason vaccine rollout going poorly, delivering tiny fraction contract.

I think missed point. Certain politicians trying discredit UK proxy. important UK seen fail Brexit, otherwise countries strong anti-EU sentiments might also end leaving. discrediting home-grown vaccine used almost 50% UK vaccinations far, say UK well seems half people quasi-ineffective vaccine kill blood clots. Better wait perfect German vaccine instead. Live NYC work told take sick day. new factory germany supplying big fraction this. agree. Im getting vaccinated soon shot available me. feels they're want AZ shot

We can't _get_ AZ shot. AZ delivers like 5% ordered first half 2021. We're trying vaccinate entire continent Pfizer AZ backstabbed us.

Perhaps health authorities less lenient vaccine countries essentially written announcement deliver anything Q2 either? It’s they’re absolute bottom-of-the-barrel. Nobody ‘wants’ work prison- prospects, innate desire ‘in charge’ shit- regardless it’s ever actually deserved, somehow despite shittiness never caught actual record yourself. Add kids thus ‘need’ decent benefits, average prison guard.

It’s like walk trailer park offer everyone clean record $40,000/year. take ignorance lack solid education work everyday.

Peace long life! 🖖 norwegian doc. two fatal cases previously healthy female healthcare workers, died brain hemorraghe within 10 days recieving vaccine.

Absolutely one funniest things I’ve read awhile. Lol Sure mate According Financial Times actually co-ordinated responses: Macron spoke Merkel Draghi ""suspending"" vaccine.

These kind decisions made politicians all. Boris never interferes MHRA Biden interfere FDA.

The EU leaders went one, attempt trash AstraZeneca's reputation. care cost lives citizens. Season 3 low point. Seasons 4-6 pretty good! given lockdowns countries (europe) due slow vaccine rollouts..will world wise summer vacations thing summer? USA, plan within USA vacation only? Theoretically, that’s free market work. following advice regulators, others, like France, knee-jerk way without recommendation: there's problem many scientific bodies, like EMA, WHO, MHRA, etc disagreeing decision suspend - perfect illustration fact decision suspend scientific question, risk evaluation question subjective answer. blue gatorade shit, yo. it. 3 blood donations platelet donation testing positive antibodies since August 2020. EMA spreading propaganda concluding vaccine safe there's evidence link: ? Edgelords gotta edgy. friend brought point I’m sure respond regarding COVID vaccine efficacy data.

He works medical facility people severe COVID symptoms test negative PCR test. Pfizer vaccine study seems show 95% efficacy preventing positive PCR tests - people symptoms tested negative would included it. could know people aren’t excluded test due this, would lower efficacy rate? He’s saying vaccine ineffective, trials excluding data. What’s preventing test increasing likelihood test negative PCR test, still giving symptoms? Remember Canada embarassed USA's way handling pandemic..have tables turned way USA handling vaccine rollout? Norway blood clotts vaccine. 
So, im glad stopped it. find odd UK havent seen anything. likley caused bad batch. I'm hooked new pretzel bacon pub cheeseburger moment! I'm projecting anything. I'm simply repeating experts saying. vaccine safe cause clots, according European Union's medicines regulator reiterated indication Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots, several countries paused rollouts. Yeah, Swedish company subsidiary UK company UK HQ. assume OP thinking of. brand dragged mud AZ lots intangible loses account for. I'd like hear 5%. Check press releases governments EMA. Always better go direct source. Media bit hit miss describing actual concerns (vs short cutting blood clots). 

Blood clots combined low numbers platelets.
Thromboembolic events Pfizer tends one circle. Second shot faster moderna second shot seems easier side effects since dosage less. J&amp;J wins ones never cared much Covid aren’t anti vax cause it’s one done. 

Older mixed want J&amp;J cause think mRNA could alter DNA, others want Pfizer cause it’s German Catholic don’t want J&amp;J would take moderna/Pfizer.  used issue, arms, even though relatively skinny clearly visible veins. veteran blood taker found solution, lie 90 degrees. moment lay muscles body relaxed blood flow improved easily able draw blood first try 2 others failed arms. Maybe help draw blood future. Even EMA said benefits taking vaccine far outweigh outweigh risks. Far far people die Covid now. Belgium?

I mean, look Twitter find hundreds people complaining Belgian government stupid ban killer vaccine already.

I suppose time fact government tone deaf people actually helping us. Gotcha. Maybe want glib thought made be. initially sounded like shitting competency Red Cross. There's significant opportunity everyone else undercut them, then. Fuck them. Making profit one thing, blatant profiteering another. get probably lot “Alabamians, stupid,” here, don’t forget black Alabamians suffered Tuskegee (rightfully) passed distrust generations.

When you’ve taken advantage badly, it’s understandable hesitant. Yep it'll potentially hurt publics confidence AZ across EU. Maby probably feel safe delaying EU vaccinations feel same! Unfortunately mine go away day 11 Pfizer vaccine wins either way...

The eu national political class want blame companies rather rollout win ways though. No, week. future reference always look another version pfizer moderna. speak Italy. Germany quite clearly political decision medical one, scientists health minister made clear. national institute vaccines (Paul Ehrlich Institut) found several cases specific rare type thrombosis brain young patients vaccinated. other, general cases thrombosis might statistically significant, one is. cases Denmark Norway doctors also said symptoms extremely unusual like regular thrombosis. gets investigated.

The German health minister urged everyone get AstraZeneca vaccine safe next morning pause vaccinations new findings recommendations doctors. good look political gain flip-flop.

But course simple narrative EU politicians slow vaccinations citizens discredit British vaccine, seems popular here... realize politicians act based medical advisors tell right ? Like Merkel listened Paul Ehrlich Institute said. PEI vs EU's regulator says certainly better 20 30 year olds much lower risk die COVID. survey published journal Nature Medicine, residents 19 countries asked would take Covid vaccine “proven safe effective.” China, 89 percent people said yes. U.S., 75 percent did. shares lower across Europe: 68 percent Germany, 65 percent Sweden, 59 percent France 56 percent Poland.

These figures kind shock little. guess expected Europe less ignorant types things, especially given specific situation Covid. charge people hundred dollars dollars worth medicine, pay people hundred dollars blood save someone's life.  announcement change EU’s overall forecast vaccine supplies 300 million doses second quarter drugmakers bloc signed contracts with.

Not sure understand means. extra BioNTech doses intended cover expected shortfall doses (over already know)? Janssen starting wobble? obviously dont live USA thank God dont need idiot's one president already. Beep beep. Booooooooop. 🤖 👍🏽 first error assume Brexiteer haha... It’s always minimizing risk match person’s personal risk tolerance based conditions surroundings! 

Feels like lot people don’t understand folks lower risk tolerances love judge people do. Curious: pass stop process? pump fluids back you? assume using formula one already approved, tweaked cover new variants? assume latter would risky start testing kids?? Hopefully one listens ""executives."" said EMA evaluation individual incidents ongoing. expected complete full review Thursday

Posting non news  agree extent, think media exaggerates people. someone really think virus threat, absolutely stupid take protective measures, evil. That’s interesting idea, swing looks like it’s pretty large holds across outpatients inpatients, includes asymptotic patients. didn’t read much depth, phenomenon you’re hypothesizing plays role, it’s probably factor. 

On hand, sinusoid type pattern testing emergency cohort deviates out/in patients, likely show kind sociological driven dynamic you’re thinking about, peaks 6AM, noon, 5PM. I’m assuming driven people’s work schedules show hospital. Yeah. Maybe European plant making AZ tried rush production order meet contract obligations, leading sloppy manufacturing? knows, given report outside Europe ex-UK, manufacturing seems like logical option. Even 5 1 Million *per year* would explain seven occurrences couple weeks. Norway's incidence even higher. 

The EMA talking general thrombosis, think. Information currently shared different institutions. trust PEI assessment. Also, straight friend mine donated blood also goes Atlantic City unprotected sex prostitutes, better?

Uhh... no? would also disqualifying. So, sure, could lie like donate blood. Lmao think so. Btw live inside EU comment especially hilarious. regardless nothing EU tinpot. tinfoil thing thinking EU countries AZ political stunts. Tbf thr EMA stressed safe individual EU countries choosing suspend undetectable test then, virus evades tests? yeah well Murphy idiot. can't wait guy done ruining state jacking taxes. way wins piss poor way handled lockdowns. China - using vaccines diplomatic gain.

China maybe, AstraZeneca actually working Russian scientists. This, tell locked November many people refuse vaccinated. mean? says like ""4 antibodies"" meaning slight infection?

LOLOL yet double figure deaths day rest Europe entering fourth wave... mean people die get vaccine ever die blood clots, never mind consequences extended lockdowns due this. think donate blood vitamin deficiencies They’re ones created distributed states. even remotely. idea forcing people permanently cover face case cough horrific dystopian concept almost nobody interest in. Murphy straight said interview December adequate stimulus bill could pave way tougher mitigation measures NJ. reason open Winter passed bare bones stimulus bill December nowhere near enough fund economy. Finally voice reason! could missed something obvious. Really push R 1.1 R 0.9. We've playing around R 1 like year. Like say, maybe finally enough population immune half-assed mitigations pushed growth negative late January. prior COVID early February versus another flu/cold virus low. vast majority people even severe cold/flulike symptoms early February 2020 COVID. Additionally, antibodies fade time, know COVID antibodies typically remain least 10 months, likely longer.


So COVID early February, two unlikely things would needed happen: one first get COVID, would *also* rare case rapid antibody loss. Neither impossible, individually significantly less likely ""had bad flu/cold flu/cold season"". clear, I'm disputing *possibility* might work. weird happens given process must occur. EU decision: EMA (from EU) advising suspending AstraZeneca EU countries like Belgium, Poland, Greece, following advice. EU countries not, also non EU countries like Norway. Nobody saying vaccinate kids; I’m asking whether ethical &amp; moral parent sign kid trial without knowing enough risks (and without able consent). Since trial determine whether vaccine safe kid first place. would normally agree run mill embolism dvt, they're not. cases TTP. exceedingly rare, even young healthy people. 

I'm saying link, certainly expected background noise could it. However specific nature cases warrants investigation.

I personally think paused rollout ultimately far people die covid vaccine induced TTP.

You dig bit deeper though, check scientific community saying r/covid19. They're brushing off, neither we. Maybe somebody help answer question. New Mexico seemingly last state dropped age limit covid vaccine eligibility?

By almost every measure I've looked at, NM either first second place (behind Alaska) comes number vaccines administered. would think NM would farther along rollout, we're halfway Phase 1B we're vaccinating people 75+ 16+ health complications. point, many frontline essential workers still eligible receive vaccine 1B.

It's really sort confounding state well vaccinating population opening eligibility like many states point. Could NM much better job relative states vaccinating risk populations first? states opening eligibility many demographics lack demand older/at-risk populations? Great news Chileans!!
Meanwhile, country vaccinated 1% total population... Anyone concerned Vaccine uptake? happy opening things think 50-59 range disappointing. Hopefully younger people likely take it. Would really like see 50% pop get even kids, think realistic goal. not, exactly describe it. people reddit think know best men died covid women.

More men die assulted walking streets women.

The women assaulted, resisting arrest reasonable force used arrest result. viil left alone fine untill decided start inciteing protest darkness fell. leaders prison

The number times I've seen posted sub pretty disturbing. politicians phoned coordinate apply pressure, that's Italy! 

This attack EU people attempt cover EU procurement process give bad publicity AZ vaccine, know can't get enough satisfy need. Oh - ITP (low platelet count) worth noting already documented factor Pfizer Moderna vaccines [and investigated think that, interests excess caution, EU also temporarily shut vaccination programme drugs well? Would seem logical. Nothing anti-british, EU brexit original comment.

Giving rates blood clotting events, even causal, vaccine rollout continue investigation ongoing. Great, another reason hate COVID. already enough ""Among us children"", jokes funny. Better close schools stop rising. think they’re saying several vaccines primarily used time — AZ “primary” vaccine? flip side people struggling thoughts self harm little desire live choose make dangerous decisions signal ""virtues"" anyone resources finding offering vaccine? may eligible state next week I'm terrified needles would much prefer J&amp;J one stick I'm done. can't figure offering Pfizer offering J&amp;J though. hard time seeing mask mandates justifiable summer. businesses requiring them, think vast majority also eager mandates end.

India delivering many, many countries - countries experiencing issues too. They're mainly vaccinating healthcare workers cases would actually quite easy spot compared vaccinating general population. Yeah, that's true. chance repealed sometime 2022. that's case, better watch out. repeal time, could (inadvertently) make 2022 election turn ""masks vs masks"" people casting votes based issue alone, people fed enough. could see right now:

""Masks gone long! population vaccinated safe, longer needed: return 2019! Vote candidate B!"" (You assume party candidate, since know moment)

Then again, November 2022, almost 2023 point. something Pritzker **must** consider he's going run again. definitely want happen. “normal” times, kids participate trials already sick trial gives chance get better vs much bleaker outcome. Here, talking healthy kids. don’t know one would solve problem. Weren’t scandals vaccine experiments African children? conspiracy theory. (My point being, Pharma companies would experiment drugs children 3rd world disguise ‘cure’ ‘solve’ ethical problem way). anyone please explain vaccine takes long take effect?

I mean get cold, immunity builds maximum 2-3 days right? fighting billion viruses injection.

I'm assuming foreign object injected muscles, antibodies detect minutes. I'm puzzled takes weeks ??

AstraZeneca mentioned vaccine takes 90 days !! one shot, attain 81% efficacy. viral vector injected muscle even 2-3 days. WBCs destroy them?

Why efficacy increase days?
Sorry many questions. need another stimulus bill that's filled government pork. fuck sides nonsense. future generations going left bill frivolous spending. everyone thinks free money realize nothing ever free we'll left paying long run. many people short sighted. sounds like classic ESH situation AITA. large gathering (unless vaccinated), reality people cookout relatively safe one compared stuff like bars clubs (or even indoor party).

It’s suspended high number highly unusual cases, far regular blood clot case. don’t know suspending vaccination correct, however BBC giving full picture here. Don’t know you’re downvoted telling truth. significant part vaccines Europe going use manufactured US UK. countries prevented medical companies exporting doses promised European countries. Benefits citizens, expense European citizens. schools open Hamburg? are, rest restrictions help much. Honestly listening. 

We're using next two weeks find out. Nobody knows point beneficial not. needs investigated know. test 20% false negative rate. Again, mainstream media misinterprets going on.

Those typical blood clots.

 astronomical rare combination sinus vein thrombosis +thrombocytopenia

Recent explanation similar cases Germany: saying ignore cases - obviously look - suspension proportional response point.

Is suspension (for days) really bad?

The bottleneck vaccination available doses.

So within days ending suspension, available doses used again.

Giving scientists days investigate situation looks like sound response me. assures people concerns taking seriously, too. I'm sure expert worry also nothing people trust process. tired this. Instead vaccinating like crazy

Ah yes, non-existing vaccines. Super strategy. number people lose suspension &lt; group risk due problem.

Given number people problem thus far, ""only/if"" criteria may well met. There's certainly doubt, otherwise, think developed countries like UK/Canada still progressing vaccine? best part Europe can´t wait vaccination passport inevitably going result boomers going vacation summer population gave save stuck home aren´t enough vaccines. never said EU based decision UK numbers. responded person saying issue found people got one vaccines js true. found incidence rate everywhere vaccines. think need better reading gotta something else besides vaccine **like contaminated batch** Germany getting doses from. AZ done best job undermine position eyes EU member states. clarify:

It's stopped alleged blood cloths. 

It's stopped symptoms show 1-2 weeks vaccination (skin lesions blood related symptoms). 

It's safety measure symptoms investigated.

the sad thing likely continue months news cases days. People seen concerns. People hate taking active risks. 

And Germany, know vaccine get sit get it. suspending AZ moment, make sure noone misses shot want risk AZ.

So suspending AZ build lot trust government lot people. (""They take concerns seriously"")

In days, investigation concluded AZ ""proven"" safe, start using AZ again.

Germany use lot doses per day has/gets. using AZ days impact situation longterm. thought antibody tests identify specific coronaviruses, could test positive cold recently?

Also, thought antibody test could still show positive time antigen test, toward later end covid infection? Russians, Slovaks, Finns, Swedes, Americans, etc. AZ still legally obligated fulfill EU requirements regardless temporary ban, think unused 10m AZ USA sits freezer somewhere. That's stupid analogy. We're talking science, middle class boasting party.

It amuses nobody actually disagrees me, hate saying it. That's ... living real world since 1974. Hello everyone pleasant day.

This goes people France Germany London specifically. 
I Israel recently vaccinated citizens got finally allowed travel. now, allowed go France, Germany London.

I student would like travel colleagues. looking perfect place visit 3 5 days, could go bars, restaurants (if possible) clubs.

If anyone one destinations inform situation COVID-19 country, and/or knows whether got bars open help a-lot! 

Thanks ahead! think there's probably differences, depending definition. 

In Germany probably lot people stemming eastern Mediterranean region, UK relatively people south east Asia say France people North Africa. 

If ultra rare medical complications happening certain groups could happen pop countries larger number group present. However also would easy track imagine case. Spahn resign guess depends media one consumes. prefer news entertainment information, unfortunately many outlets calling news really latter. removed [from scalpel] mechanically? Yes UK data decision based on. Norway 6 cases, two dead 120k vaccinations. That, plus 6 deaths Germany Italy, new data spurred action, UK numbers. one suggesting looking it, continue vaccinating investigating experts saying read somewhere idea still going die that. sitting decades, waiting. Crazy. Astrazeneca similar incidence blood clots Phizer far (UK data). suggesting then?

To investigate deadly side effect people question vaccine?

That's biggest gift could ever make anti-vaccers. lowers trust vaccine, keeps trust high vaccine regulators. that's much, much important. UK seen far bigger drop COVID rates amongst groups first vaccine Phizer, Astrazeneca otherwise. 

It gamble, paid hopefully allow UK quarantine sooner stop deaths . Yes I’m struggling make sense that. It’s also extremely hard democratically elected leaders vacate populations first. want US export ASAP imagine political backlash? Hamburg never really opened numbers still going up, think longer Lockdown, higher change people becoming reluctant stop caring rules... point thing help speeding vaccinations!  Never would thought year ago first started reading still would US hadn’t approved AZ there’s million doses Maryland right now. Totally different whatever Europe doing. saying throw away scalpel one brain surgery?? dna test, apparently variant prion protein (PrP) immune misfolding cant prion diseases. thankfully, diseases scary shit live South Germany, check asked Antibody test go bloodwork. Negative, sign antibody. think Id CoVid thought maybe might small number antibodies. absence evidence imply evidence absence.

You equally possible caused vaccine. think anyone lying tbh. talking rumor problem factory producing AZ everyone else, Brits using domestic factory produce themselves?

I think so. I'm entrenched EU vs GB war though might getting news/propaganda.

As far halting vaccination goes, think problem discussion become political, politicians media using false information least taken context / properly analyzed information narratives.

Take AZ efficiency case. understood, trials / kind people them, even done people countries, could chance people got Covid vaccinated AZ Pfizer/Moderna vaccines got infected different strains. So, vaccine actually efficient strain really known initial trials.

They could said ""okay, wait data, vaccinate young people"". End story. tabloids even politicians allowed play games spin context.

Then get case, may may random events. may mostly young, possibly also mostly female HCW got vaccine, statistics thrown off, means specific group, chance happening non-random/above random compared regular population. think case, wise halt vaccination tbh. part process, agree on, boosts confidence vaccines end.

It unfortunate people waiting vaccinations, think least Norway, enough Pfizer/Moderna arriving get old people vaccinated people higher risk. rest us, got wait little bit longer.
I'm fine this, see someone getting vaccine AZ might be, someone getting vaccines all. way works. Stop projecting british nationalism vaccine. already see conspiracy theories kind DNA virus causing genocide among specific ethnics... Moderna, J&amp;J notable issues like 

So know this? know selection bias reported?

For example, 3 days ago news article South Tyrol article someone hospitalised following AZ vaccination. read article though, also mentions dentist local area reporting period stroke died - following Pfizer vaccination. 

So guess vaccine took headline?.. temporary pause unlikely significant effect vaccination campaign, long short enough (word media right EMA issue statement thursday, countries resume using vaccine EMA says safe so). bottleneck mainland Europe number available doses. ban lifted backlog cleared quickly.

2nd dose: Arm slightly sore (still two full days later), big deal. get much sleep two nights afterward, again, vaccine bad luck? headache, poor sleep? thing say sure felt little lethargic minor muscle aches around body similar hump finally moving cold/flu. Never chills fever. 


All all? side effects minor worried vaccine effective me. add this, also need account hesitancy cause many Europeans, much damage already done. turn might also effect peoples willingness take vaccines well, close getting sucked anti-vax rubbish. 

I read quite often, i'm sure, way round.

The news cases days. 

People already concerned AZ.

Stoping use AZ cases investigated shows government takes seriously. helps building trust vaccines directly. even trust AZ get better, inverstigation shows connection cases.

On hand, stoping use AZ would crippled trust vacines, government would look like caring cases.

Another thing: Germany least could vaccinate lot people per day right doses would avilable. pausing days problematic, used doses used within days starting again. don’t disagree that. I’m saying hasn’t equal portrayal media. AstraZeneca amazing vaccine already saved probably thousands lives skewed media AstraZeneca made people seriously distrust refuse it. blood media’s hands cashing AstraZeneca narrative. 1) 9-12 weeks seems ideal.

2) Good protection day 22 90. would skip packed gym anyway. stay dormant decades. uncle could potentially infected 30 years ago article misses whole point PEI advised halt AZ Germany.

Fingers crossed! cause bullshit. What's point actually brings news eight deaths four cases serious side-effects following vaccinations Italy, added.

This way bigger 3 cases Norway. still want get vaccinated anyways. Hope stay healthy. US precarious moment recent political instability practically 4 years. There's tons idiots frothing mouth demanding America stay focused home abroad. Sadly, many idiots swing voters. Unfortunately, see US reps / Biden looking help countries finished getting country vaccinated. optics political cost feel risky atm.

It's doubly unfortunate, since could great moment re-establish relationships lacking past 4 years. course obvious. I'm really sure myself. feeling either bad batch, maybe genetic factor work. would probably lean towards suspension since really must understood better, understand countries want wait. 

In case Australia think stupid can't wait 2 weeks. zero corona deaths year. They're hardly affected. fuck that's spot on. always wondered hated those. Schools started limited capacity yesterday, new cases going last month still closed. found interesting too, said specific kind clot reason.

There's going tipping point, think coming well July, everyone wants vaccinated vaccinated incubation period vaccine effectiveness long passed. happens coupled expected drastic drop hospitalizations, deaths new cases, keeping mask mandates place longer makes sense. different every state. Bavaria provides free PCR testing everybody often want. states need doctor's health office order. pay yourself. article state specifically, read source (will track needed) found blood donations US donors late December early January contained C19 antibodies. consider blood donation demographic metadata, know ease silent transmission, C19 likely present US population long first reported cases. read article long covid research Johns Hopkins, among places. couple theories chronic covid happening people, won’t know data. 

Anyway, one theories virus might lying low body causing problems immune system cannot fully clear it.

Except EU entity responsible that. EU member states are.  luck maybe couple millions doses curevac gets approved. Gsk invested €330 Belgian plant going help produce Curevac, that's union stops flirting idea strike. Saving comment come back discover reason. Yup, even incorporated metric used health professionals called ""six minute walk test"" think like survival in-app purchase point. know almost children get illness mild symptoms also don’t, died dealing long covid.
 
The flu higher risk kids COVID. please don’t live fear. Absolutely public health workers hitting park!!

That said. I'm SUPER disappointed cluster Cleveland Clinic.

3.5 weeks dad vaccinated scrambling find appointment Clinic STILL contacted (despite ""list""). 70+, diabetic, cancer. one get arm fastest. that's believe best course action acknowledge fact we're inherently self-interested, rather trying swim current hoping people things they're predisposed do.

Sorry, disagree. (besides fact make laws time ""enforce minimum standards"".. things like speed-limits wearing seat belts. things stop idiots.. stop some). 

We can't throw hands say ""Whelp.. people stupid.. lets nothing let stupid want!"" (as millions millions die...) 

That's socially-responsible thing do. 

Again,. gets back difference personal freedoms:

* live remote Ranch middle Montana somewhere.. ""doing whatever want"" bit easy accept ""doing whatever want"" likely involve harm anyone else. 

* live middle San Francisco .. dynamic same. sick communicable disease,. going outside interacting people could (and lot cases much has) ended killing dozens people. 

So idea ""just let people people"" tenable solution. (I mean.. we're gonna that,. rescind laws unending ""Purge Night"".. ? British? AstraZeneca seems different  (EU). know  who's fault , real. Something wrong  AstraZeneca  EU. fairness, South Africa paused AZ vaccinations due poor efficacy first. 

And AZ's data showed one worst-in-class efficacies. 

Over US, FDA grant EUA based AZ conducted.

It's candidate exceeded expectations every stage development, production, delivery, proved resilient variants. Failing meet standard forgiveable, every product judged relative competitors, rest market making look bad. 

I'm defending decision-making EU member state politicians. I'm certainly trashing EU endorsing vaccine's continued use. pointing like EU member states outliers acting like mind another vaccine give populations first. you! Driving 90 minutes way one Friday Wow!!! 50K appointments unfilled. think states opening eligibility may really supply.

From always did? Disregarding pricing here, another discussion entirely 

Why find concept booster shots bleak? doubt you’ve gotten many throughout childhood Way ahead ya! Anyone thinking Pfizer good company paying attention. even develop vaccine, Germany lab / company small handle logistics needed partnered Pfizer. got Pfizer current companies, least surprised hear suggesting this. next worst J&amp;J, vaccine bad, pharma company whatever takes maximize profits. hope Moderna pull this. I'll switch boosters Pfizer really raise price boosters significantly. AZ hear least likely something like this. Sure will. medications treatments overpriced United States cost fraction free Europe. could try looking medical cost diffential US ""free"" market social subsidized Healthcare making uninformed comments. would say something controversial, yet brave? I'm Montreal everything closed, interesting now.
When restaurants bars reopen events restart, different, expect happen fall.

I hope border open fall. planning attend Nascar race 2020, think possible year (even border reopen, probably still limited attendance) still slight hope. ah ok. misunderstood - sorry. We'll open borders sends us sweet sweet vaccines 😉 know problem, certain days wearing mask hours work issue days (like today) feel like can't breathe one on. anybody else deal anything feel like I'm suffocating hours? Yea that's I'm saying, that's also used South Korea counter example, country death reports majority vaccinations AZ (they blood clot related iirc) investigated ended ruling 8/15 reports remaining ongoing recent march, think norway choosing halt big deal either countries clots even reported also halting. One worry biasing falsely equating strange death vaccine related. main gripe reporting headlines creating links simply proven exist (yet?) dangerous.

I know people still turned initial reporting AZ, wish lived society great majority people like did, make informed decision take upon critical analysis risk assessment, live world, unfortunately yes sours everything. is, wait see. Flu shots peak around 5m day means 5m current capacity fema others top it. Supply still bottleneck. There’s 100 million shots administered United States. bombarding anecdotes people crippled. point 25 million people confirmed covid 500,000 dying. believe long enough timeline, everyone get covid stay house permanently, I’ll take odds vaccine deadly virus. Remember people calling ""The Rona""? still thing? May 14th day!! way last week getting groceries (not CP obviously) busy bees. Gonna great season!

From Yeah scoring RTX 3080 PS5 feel like I've training moment Jealous California. Go Ohio! mathematics minor, thanks man. tell never taking statistics class, too. 

First all, study 2015 nucleic acid testing detect HIV 10 days post infection searches virus itself. also referring third generation testing, fourth generation testing accuracy 42 days (directly citation). also risk window period, window period accuracy increases 100% (once again, directly citation). 

The CDC individuals. leading health organization America. use plenty math, trust me.

That article list links read regarding HIV testing accuracy directly listed CDC website. looks like read it, favor nitpicking single study. much patronizing, lack total self awareness speaking me? language supposed somehow patronizing? flagged right thing suspending it.

Even true causing blood clots (which big if), ~10 deaths might cause dwarfed impact delaying rollout couple weeks. 

Especially Covid rates many countries Europe spiking they're vaccinated vulnerable yet. Thousands could die this. That's terrible, I'm sorry. 

My uncle kids much older were. say, difficult watch someone healthy robust wither away quickly.  What's 7-day average distribution? I'd say little bit early discuss giving away ~70% country first shot yet. anything, discussions Canada get borders opened. heard exact thing “my doctor hasn’t called yet” friend late 60s. He’s certainly capable using website register, feels unless doctor calls him, there’s need get one. 

I couldn’t believe hearing, it’s stunning see someone else reporting conversation. tax worth listen sublime dingy basement smells like farts. Good them. Apparently Germany luck. Potluck. It’s beyond condescending.

Mate, led comment telling something never even posted untrue. How's condescending? Yes, absolutely feels like picking fight state ""this"" ""unequivocally"" untrue reference something never eligibility limitations straight people

There eligibility restrictions specifically targeting straight sex.

Correct. not.

That probably accurately summarizes issues 2nd post. treat two sentences interchangeable not.


Own it. posted bunch untrue statements language incredibly unprecise. think saying X, not, saying untrue.

One Final question:

Would still make argument policy discriminates sensuality monogamous exemption? pay 100 bucks. hahah classic. spent several years working clients Germany. sums nicely. Yeah toddler literally can't wear mask? Damn get mad called you. Yeah guys rec pot. don’t agree free range approach—there still restrictions place people vaccinated. it’s time open more. I'm sure best plan is, I'm happy state make best guess itself. Yeah, grew Seattle, near I-5, runs way Southern California. Except there, call ""The 5"". Always thought weird. counts distributed even delivered tho Rule number 1.... cardio bet almost states gonna open April 1 flew rocket ship mars last night actually saw unicorns speak of. Prove didn't. feel too. Doesn’t mean kid’s situation improved parents getting COVID. really talking grownup? Ironic, dog tasty food. someone grew US left 15 years ago, modern America continuously shocks me. “I feel them” non religious way saying I’m praying them. case needed spell you. really talking adult 5 year old child?

Now really feel them. *maybe more, statistically speaking Late responses.

True, locked borders.  “Info” “Here’s reach ever get sick COVID need someone take care child recover - free, course!” You’re concerned kid, all. could hugely that, given donating blood easy way get free antibody test. Plenty states still giving vaccines unless retiree pre existing conditions. Yes states ""far ahead"" there's still supply issues. OK understand Texas: fired this? affect you? keep doing. Model almost definitely work home. stay home another month get vaccination. clearly want go even could. someone wants go bar risk infection death, matter you? get groceries delivered. reason feeling better everyone else?

Like said, personal responsibility. Come California. We're smart take away you. You’re starting sound like blood boy. Quiet down, Joshua. agree. south, sure. Probably anywhere else. Well veering different territory. certainly believe systemic issues, saying better doesn’t change reality. Kids rely school right now, future another problem. Living TX, dealt two government officials let known give damn citizens pandemic happened! stripped local mayors tried enforce mask mandate rule penalities authority, stood side Trump downplayed mask usage CDC covid guidelines, mind you...Abbott, aka hell wheels, already got vaccinated opening back TX 100% ended mask mandate last week honestly anything except offer baseless security businesses. 

People TX literally fend right now, essential workers still eligible getting vaccine, last week teachers finally are. 
Most young supposed, healthy, folks sre getting vaccine still may interact grandma grandpa they're working essential jobs let take vaccine!  Yep. That’s exactly shouldn’t enacting policies tremendous toll human life outcome best marginal. Hasn’t Taiwan done really well too? think remember reading somewhere. nurse vaccinated, good you.

I regular person group 1c.

A majority people vaccinated.
Cased higher state higher first peak absolutely devastating houston.

Once majority people vaccinated case numbers controlled time get path 100% 

If dont follow guidance medical experts giving, even guidance covid nurse give then, sorry say, yes stupid. Plain simple. Officials responded point saying limiting factor volunteers give injections space host injecting raw vaccine supply. would stay open 24/7 supply picture made possible. make sense open 3am product. (I'm parroting press conferences, please shoot messenger.) got Gatorade pushed bus.

It blue cool though. Can't even donate blood grew Britain mad cow disease thing...THIRTY YEARS AGO! info? want dick size? It’s mediocre. I'm surprised US using vaccine supply weapon ongoing trade wars Canada involving lumber. honest mammograms marginally helpful preventing death individual level. sometimes discover cancer, sure, good portion time nothing done prevent death anyway, even common results highly invasive operations cancer would kill you. societal level though, recommend could save *someone*. Lots people don’t side effects vaccines. Nothing worry about, side effects correlate level immunity. Congrats getting vaccinated! Flattened curve mean over. longer increasing cases. time throw towel. like almost there. 1 5 thoughtful generous caring Americans worry fellow humans. makes sense expand everyone people need cant get supply isnt yet. supply meet demand, thats would make sense open right now, dont grandma’s cookies tiny hard rock cookies you’d get like vending machines school something? thinking something else? What, what? mean wife still lingering cough since December? opened qualifications gradually. Yes, one antibodies tested negative Covid19. Ask away...  Enough take care come COVID? PM info. like nvdia releasing 3080 Ti lol course, sending food homes much ask rich country like ours. paying parents enough could actually afford feed them. way J+J mRNA ones (Moderna, Pfizer) work different think big knows official study, doubt be. think would recommend right now.  EUA, lot due diligence track who's getting case issues occur. Unlikely, important done. certainly seems like care hell lot kid. feel them. I'm getting second shot 3 weeks. Bring on, small price pay. also validate anything great speeding process multiple 20-30 year old, healthy, remote worker friends got vaccinated January ""work healthcare industry"". We're Tech consultants supporting healthcare client (we also mandate office near future). mind blown admitted talking vaccine rollout weeks ago. gleefully described easy nobody verified anything. desperately want vaccine I'm big enough asshole pull selfish bullshit. Statically, many people would developed blood clots anyhow. 

1600+ people died getting moderna Pfizer vaccines. 1600 100 million statistically par baseline, too. too. armpit lymph nodes killing type this. (2nd Pfizer dose 4 days ago). nearly population e.u second ignorant one else appears caring kid, look us best can. kids rely upon food school daily meals? rich kids? dunk cookies Bluebird Apple juice, oh yeah! realize that. That's great. I'm guessing time set border, we'll probably re-opened anyway. mean EU prides getting drugs cheap negotiating cut throat prices pharmaceutical companies. kind product that. US showered drug companies money make vaccines, course delivered US first foremost. 💎💉 told it’s blood. Sure surprised me. wish state state breakdown; feel like I’m going fighting virus next 10 years Idaho many conspiracy nut jobs come woodwork. Please lord, let 40% get it... Yeah. keeps losing 5G connection. hear pro max connect reliable 6G vaccine gives 5G all. Nah, Loch Ness Monstah needs full case proper immunization happy covering remotest location, village vaccination center population 2000. experience logistics needs open up. This, yes. least point trying make. high enough dose non replicating ad vecotr lead thrombocytopenia.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s mostly inefficient, analogue bureaucracy. Driven absurd data protection laws. Downright embarrassing. real thing pseudo science thing Im 1B group getting vaccinated tomorrow =), qualms people risk luxury WFH get vaccine anyway possible. That's genetic form though. CDC says occurs 1 million people. 

This guy can't give blood due variant form, vCJD transmissible.

 like 4 cases ever detected US. would Pfizer personally given choice it’s you. misunderstood this. hospital they're takes patients Norway need specialised treatment local hospitals cannot provide. shipment process much easier ordinary vaccines whole world much vaccinated. Otherwise ongoing pandemic third world countries got vaccines cause new variants create new pandemics. I'm sure actions taken across EU worth eroding public confidence vaccinations ... 

But taking action would also erode public confidence. Imagine media reporting people dying blood cloth nobody anything, would also impact public confidence 

I know details, know something worth investigating (Like patient similar medical history, significant blood-cloth excess given batch) assume people working health authority know do, took whole case account. Know, marketing operation show public incident seriously investigated something worrisome ? guess we'll know next 10 days. consistent death rate c.1% Wait what? Why? fear take flu world fucked Thanks. fake news BAD nationwide collective action led government.

You're wrong, think far delicate way describe behavior (some of) American public past year. we've seen simple dignified ""I like government telling do"" - borderline sociopathic behavior massive scale. argument never ""every single life matters"".

The argument lockdowns prevent health care system collapsing due potentially high rates hospitalization, resource stretching triaging, etc

I care state-mandated lockdowns (as opposed voluntary social precautioning based free association), that's never about. approval type emergency approval, reason emergency phase3 testing finished all.

Besides approval process age groups 0-6, 6-12 12-16 still going. Israel testing 12-16 age group right since want fully vaccinate entire population. Moreover %50 percent new cases Israel coming age group 18. Therefore say phase3 totally approved unless age groups tested verified. person cited article Dr. Ding level . Awesome.. area. hospital they're takes patients entire country need specialised treatment local hospitals cannot provide. **trial** period Maybe rural figure covid situation urgent city?? maybe take grandma city get it. sure Sputnik made 2P modification spike protein, otherwise tweak using different base adenoviruses first second dose seems like simple solution problem potentially developing immunity vector virus covid spike. things happened high school! past fire Marshall’s limit, built new school, within 10 years turn middle school build another one!

we always always have. concerned past idk would start now. “Just”? Everything *just* archaic outdated. way properly verifying someone's vaccinated not, becomes problem contact tracing everyone different sets rules. Everyone operating sets rules makes easier. pulled link see that's what's actually recommended; not. coronavirus pandemic ends, California transitions green … sounds appealing, give careful consideration learning pandemic changing long-term behavior,” Swartzberg said. “For example, would much better future [we] adopted culture wearing mask one least indication respiratory illness (this common Asia). Further, restructuring society crushed together people become norm.”

That read permanent mask wearing, realistically, there's way could enforce scenario described. sounds lot like pushing public health awareness ad campaigns encouraging people wear mask leave home cold/flu symptoms, rethinking public spaces designed. relatively decent evidence also people reporting conflicts interest. think say whatever want evidence, whatever perception strength may be, point need wait proof go around stating something fact Rural areas masks non existent. urban area heavily Democratic wears masks regardless. Unfortunately reality political. Happy see developed vaccine. article says it’s inactivated virus vaccine probably similar Sinovac Covaxin used China India respectively. Hopefully it’s job keeps safe. faster get planet protected better us. fucking 1980s?

A lot laws regulations are. local control applies means city governments state government wants do.

Great another thing able get live EU they're going fuck too. new gates chip 7 nm yet stuck 14 nm? Blame governments made return normalcy based vaccination then. tell people ""you must live isolated get vaccine matter what"" expect people do?

We shifting back normal business masks, people feel though must get vaccine risk economically ruined.

Fuck, someone posted article yesterday employers need require vaccination employment NOW. Aka: vaccinated risk losing job.

That's absolutely ridiculous can't ways. actual vaccine. reputation. AZ news going flow US, FDA approves it, pump vaccine hesitation. clear EMA pro-AZ.

Virtually nobody outside France pays attention Macron says. für eine Rolle spielt das ""hilfreich sein"" von Kommentaren einem Diskussionsforum wie Reddit überhaupt? Die Annahme, dass die Politik oder die öffentliche Meinung sich tatsächlich daran ausrichten ist eine Illusion. 

Wem soll ein Kommentar also helfen? Der ""orthodoxen"" Meinungsfraktion, die besagt dass niemand Schuld hat, außer alle, die rausgehen und ihr Leben führen wollen?

Wir versagen hier auf ganzer Linie und ruinieren unsere Chancen, die Pandemie zu überwinden, weil eine zweistellige Anzahl Menschen **unter Millionen Geimpften** Blutgerinnsel entwickelt hat - auch obwohl sich für die Verträglichkeit des Impfstoffes aussprechen.

Wie weit soll die ""German Angst"" vor Verantwortung und Risiken noch gehen? think there's blood clot stuck brain reasoning anything go by. 90% vaccinated, 90% people aged 16+ either vaccinated previously infected.

WFH interacting lot people. I’ll go restaurant outside seating. expand this? CDC [Vaccination dashboard quite good. We're even dealing smaller scale within Oregon, like kind Inception onion thing. county ball administering doses day 1, much supply curtailed counties getting doses catch us population%-wise FWIW there's big site nearby, enter zip code myturn. found showing otherwise even within search radius insane reason. Well let's find possible link first, possible consequences are. trust vaccine reasonable degree, need get bottom this. Science must allowed job! UK keeping side effects awesome vaccine wraps? say. agree masks effective, think overkill everyone wear flu season  there's one stop 500+ person wedding zero masks/tests/social distancing, correct? can't plop cast stage. They're gonna need rehearsal time year working. give vaccine lockdowns forever prefer that. biggest concern (although stop getting whatever available) knowing shot end getting impact eligibility / medical clearance receive booster shots new variants, especially timelines approving booster shots differs significantly vaccines. could get vague reassurance total shit show probably give another shot vaccine end with. AZ decides pandemic ""over"". Apparently means Q3 2021. small part know treat effectively. study mean particularly, however local enlarged lymph nodes uncommon vaccine. EU political leaders put blame AZ abysmal vaccine rollout throughout EU

The rollout abysmal certain manufacturer delivering fraction promised.

The UK vaccinate quickly AZ. EU seven times bigger needs multiple suppliers. 3 vaccines available Q1 Pfizer, Moderna AZ, Moderna technology Pfizer.

Logically, means EU always going end relying AZ degree.

AZ taken trust pissed it. flagrantly broke promises. think ""best effort"" would hold court basically lied UK plants available even bothered submit Dutch plant approval.

Because that, EU vaccination effort proceed half speed J&amp;J comes online.

This course fodder brexit camp, forgetting vaunted British vaccine reason EU behind first think would ""shoot foot"" 

It's shooting foot getting vaccines begin with.

If political influence, imagine less along lines inventing issues none, along lines less lenient AZ Pfizer AZ write-off anyway.

The Q2 cuts mean countries simply scrapped AZ vaccination schedules vaccines fall truck way Europe considered bonus rather anything rely on.

This means much downside investigating potential issue. less likely get covid vaccine, less likely spread it. percentages... start handing free ice cream go vaccine, I'm going feel left out.

I even get sticker, although get free vaccine I'm broken it. would've paid put Covid behind free. nice see respected expert saying something like getting published media. I'm layperson, maybe nature variants changes models, using basic pattern recognition, almost cannot fourth surge (at least one that's anywhere even remotely close we've already). 

It's 3-4 months peaks; roughly 2 months one peak, building new one 6-8 weeks bottom. We're currently roughly 2 month mark peak, least far, pattern appears holding - we're bottoming levelling roughly expected time. theoretically, could/should another month LEAST new surge would even getting ground, closer 2 months would really dire like summer/winter. We'll absolute SHIT ton people vaccinated another 2 months now. see it, barring escape variant (which there's zero evidence of, strong evidence unlikely). Downvoted posting requested sources? That's upvote dawg Israel dropping last COVID restrictions? UK also using vaccinate younger health workers people 65 clinically vulnerable significant increase clot incidence seen.

How many given AZ vs Biontech/Pfizer? Spot on. able stockpile doses ramp vaccinations give clear. Cat 5 hurricane! cannot convince anti-vaxxers they're wrong. however establish broad trust vaccination programs - covid overall - taking issues like serious. Yes taint reputation AZ showing take issue seriously never harm overall opinion vaccines. hide information people stay uninformed think right. right. would die ever living somewhere like well. Good lord can't imagine. citizen place like that, subject. conditioned think government knows what's best obeyed rulers, kept control representatives.
 
I'll tell history kind to, governments respect people's rights.

Government simply necessary evil restrained minimized much possible. think differences caused 30 percent discrepancy efficacy?

I realllllly want mess even mild form COVID due unknown concerns long term health effects. one vaccine worse preventing mild form illness other, I'd much prefer getting one Universal flu vaccine literal therapies flu COVID uses mRNA code crispr protein called cas13a destroys viral RNA it’s directed to, therefore stopping viral replication. Instead hit miss antivirals.  Odds you’re going get way sooner that. totally understand pessimism. mean expect lymph nodes closest injection site palpable? Well duh, Norway Iceland valid concerns bandwaggoning EU nations either nationalism, political grandstanding incompetence, none look pretty.  Canada back line, front. We'll enough vaccines 3 doses per adult end September based 2 mRNA vaccines, we've approved 2 since then. Look Israel's data. cuts chances transmission massive amount. hope get chance get vaccinated soon. Another headline mentioned worry neighboring countries. flights Brazil still allowed around world, every country concerned. wish they'd grow brain wake instead idiots. got second dose asked medics arm other, said matter

I make quick judgment call decided chose arm case undiscovered local effect

Europe currently really fails levels, total disaster low expectations recent history new effort truly impressive. Amazing accomplished good leadership. says microwave radiation rare means still possible would likely harder recovery time whatever may cause. link site second paragraph mentions fda. Microwave Oven Safety Standard
Through Center Devices Radiological Health (CDRH), FDA sets enforces standards performance electronic products assure radiation emissions pose hazard public health.

A Federal standard (21 CFR 1030.10) limits amount microwaves leak oven throughout lifetime 5 milliwatts (mW) microwave radiation per square centimeter approximately 2 inches oven surface. limit far level known harm people. Microwave energy also decreases dramatically move away source radiation. measurement made 20 inches oven would approximately 1/100th value measured 2 inches oven.

The standard also requires ovens two independent interlock systems stop production microwaves moment latch released door opened. addition, monitoring system stops oven operation case one interlock systems fail.

All ovens must label stating meet safety standard. addition, FDA requires ovens label explaining precautions use. requirement may dropped manufacturer proven oven exceed allowable leakage limit even used conditions cautioned label.

To make sure standard met, FDA tests microwave ovens laboratory. FDA also evaluates manufacturers' radiation testing quality control programs factories.  sample \*1\* person per vaccine. know people who've Pfizer, side effects reported. know lot people who've AZ, guess think quarter people report feeling bit lousy day so, report ""can't get bed"" type symptoms day - intense fever, aches etc (probably similar had). Says someone country people still use paper checks. kinda evolutionarily programmed obsessed pattern recognition wariness. worked really well looking spiders cave identifying predator noises stalking us.

but ability identify patterns might threat often leads us tomfoolery comes medical treatments.

That - utter lack mathematical illiteracy comes probabilities - even many engaged medical field kinds led this. receiving less vaccine per capita many states. hope state starts getting allocated. They’re worth investigating, doesn’t facts sort rule vaccine cause? 

The chance vaccine administered tens millions people across world causing cluster like one place is... small even pay attention to, right? That’s unlikely probability standpoint. raw dog air public? worst thing wants vaccines keep using political gain.

[Mexico vaccinating poorest citizens first — advice health Oregon - maybe July? vastly important difference 3ft 6ft airflow, circulation, filtration. Everyone gets hung easy conceptualize implement part, ignores important part that’s vastly expensive challenging. CA. sister knows she’s normally eligible right now, doesn’t want take vaccine someone needs it, respect. option moment recent poll pegged 48% republican men saying willing get vaccinated, means millions republican men get vaccinated, still, 48% everything pretty much open...

No way small amount vaccinated people making change. said people hoarding entire supply N95s people medical industry needed way more. decent supply medical industry evidence cloth masks helped told us. 

Also originally thought covid primarily spread people touching surfaces face that’s similar viruses spread. case masks wouldn’t actually helped much Oregon actually getting shafted vaccines per capita compared luckier states. Alaska getting ~60% doses per capita. 

Mississippi receiving 7% doses vaccine hesitant state country. ~35% people said definitely going get it. 

When put together, receiving slightly supply far fewer people interested. well im glad still possible people! im one younger educators felt bad jumping line age-wise knew allowing us get jabbed would also try force us go back person. unfortunately right /: hope so. work field around people constantly. Even diligent masking distancing, sure point. assumed would soreness maybe headache something common, mouth watering weird quick shot, strange. potentially thousands people dead vaccine gets refused.

The benefit risk ratio still extremely favorable, even cases linked vaccine.

In Germany around 1.7m ppl vaccinated AZ SEVEN cases investigated now. 

I see seven cases number subjects warrant halt, potential danger disease far outweighs risk vaccination even cases caused vaccine.

If number ppl get covid-19, see thousand dead, seven cases part lethal.

This story wrong. off. makes sense makes ppl angry (such me) gives others food anti vax crap.

I get it. Hebrew read right left. narrative false, people suffering serious conditions right now, like lady 54F underlying health jab first March batch ABV5811

Day 2 high temperature

Day 3 didn’t stop vomiting needed intravenous feeding

Day 4-11 slept time couldn’t speak. Family called ambulance, paramedics checked vital signs considered hospitalisation needed 

Day 12 couldn’t move left leg, family brought hospital

Today hospital intracranial haemorrhage, heart attack, DVT aortic artery blocked plaque That’s fucking shit ton money lol public know better thought. Worse, couple friends Texas told stuff even close normal there, people still observing restrictions

I'll keep reclusive. latest Germany, Italy, France, Spain issues blood clots side effects due Astra vaccine. yup, I'll wait little longer. I'm hoping least ""angry birds"" band-aid. Medical professionals probably got pfizer jab easier te first get it. However UK also vaccinated 18 65 year old vulnerable people probably mostly got Az vaccines happened later. getting ratio time bit clinically vulnerable given astrazeneca jabs pfizer educated guess based fact medical professionals first groups offered vaccines around January, whereas clinically vulnerable vaccinated now. last guy “me first, rich Americans, Putin, maybe regular Americans.” Canadian border closed Canada American idiots like you. never recorded long term side effect vaccine, ever. obviously side effects adverse reactions, happen quickly. Ireland's plan pretty much lock forever? 24/7 vaccine sites california tend mass vaccination sites would expect big line Colorado still digging 2 feet snow. Pretty much everything canceled here. Wyoming got hit hard well. That's beauty it. 3 million also millions, 107 million.

If willing go suburb, appointments much easier come by. article implies cases Norway indicative DVT (very common) reality cases presented like TTP DIC (extremely rare). symptoms unusual worth investigating. Canada months behind without US help anyway. hope US allows equitable export vaccines countries citizens taken care of. Rather immediate neighbours.

Lots countries, especially Africa, could use vaccines vulnerable population, countries like Canada. supply constraints now? seems like enough vaccine go around moment probably enough time AZ approved. China stepping fill void west left. 

It price vaccine nationalism. shall see toll long term, USA shown hand - abrogated role major aid supplier world trade full vaccination population.

Super interesting see plays. don’t blame countries making call, it’s right cautious. 

But decision delay millions vaccines going arms next weeks, even replacement vaccines, slow supply. inevitable result deaths, especially countries like France Italy infection deaths climbing. 

But we’re numb rising death rate now, it’s somehow palatable see slower reduction death rate see high profile deaths healthy people may killed vaccine.

Generally they're seen conservative approval process western nations (much chagrine Americans time want newer drugs places already using). Well damn. mean get 2nd dose arm? stupidly right(dominant) arm prefer sleep left side. Though, wish would've done left using mouse daily things quite unpleasant next 2 days shoulder pain shot. Props reading actual study useless. I'm confident peer review considered point. right limitation assumption we've since somehow skyrocketed *1 3 people infected SARS-CoV-2 related variant* requires mountain evidence show. number far high I've seen people repeatedly year pull numbers nowhere without considering difficult sample entire population accurately something like this. ~100,000,000 people actually infected US see something like 1,000,000 dead. Unless believe we've undercouted almost 500,000 deaths caused COVID-19. Think way: countries throughout world reasonably confident they've detected almost every actual case. 100% close. words number confirmed cases approaches total actual number hard estimate. example total number deaths New Zealand consistently matched 1% IFR (incidence fatality rate). could vary region region least sets value provides check serology data. rough estimate 500,000 600,000 deceased US looking somewhere 50-60 million total cases. That's plausible. 100 million more? I'm extremely skeptical that. Ha don’t know owe Katalin Karikó fucking hug. Sure; I'll agree one study details come yet proof. stronger evidence anything we've time, seems say Pfizer vaccine likely prevents transmission. numbers aren’t current. least US, hospitals added ECMO capacity. I’ll try pull data later. agree, world it’s probably still rare, it’s machine , also need trained staff.

I think article mentions pertains Israel. According article Israel 70 new variants

How booster shot work future? get different brand initial vaccine? Like got moderna. JnJ better one next year. get one? fever, major chills, serious fatigue, like get enough sleep fatigue. lasted 2.5 days me. 100%. Vote governor wants new normal. We’re taking vaccines go 100% back normal. others want live like hermit them. First one 5 comfirmed dead last evevning area Vestal NY. showtime 4pm. dont know look covid neighborhood info.

By time doctors figured (a non-trivial amount time), dead within couple weeks diagnosis. saying like MRNA stock? Roger that, going HAM tmrw People like oatmeal raisin cookies: haha yeah like oatmeal cookies, totally understand someone else might another favorite type. Really I'll eat anything 

People like oatmeal cookies: I'd rather fucking shoot rather eat goblin shit oatmeal raisin cookie. Fucking disgusting creation, worst thing planet good bad thing fact? Like show lot people gotten it, helpful antibodies useful somehow statistic? would great could create way physical torture. No, Lonza produces since start Switzerland, although smal numbers. upgrade factory approved Swiss authorities now. saying, along, proof prevents transmission; saying opposite, 'it proven prevent transmission', saying that. Let's assess peer reviewed studies released, meantime cannot factually say prevent transmission anyone know soon vaccine donate? still using quasi vaccine? Flu? covid; flu? What? False, also BioNTech one basically Pfizer one every western country taking. difference marketed BioNTech/Fosun instead Pfizer/BioNTech due agreements signed distribution China. edited post add extra info situation. wont anyone left right, though someone behind me. think pretty typical antibodies longer detected three four months later. mean immune system prepared fight COVID get again. rate really similar no? Like half az like people don’t like oatmeal raisin cookies, favorite lol. However...most prepackaged ones good :( Give benefit doubt, asthma nobody would know unless told them. US, I've 4 5 tests glad pay testing. get great turn need probably costs mostly time. I’m getting approved would take myself. However, see many people states rejecting this, unfortunately. Target easier, donating blood cheaper. methodology gave us totally skewed antibody prevalence level Brazil. It’s accurate. 100% recycled materials lymph nodes palpable without much concern except ones arm. palpable lymph nodes arm, something bad lumps arms arm pit cause concern. vaccine, actual issue. mean doses thus far received countries exported US? things like indoor nightclubs, bars, concerts included don’t care... RemindMe! 1 Month

Vote better. lose anti-bodies overtime. don’t know much body responds virus immune system super complex. don’t antibodies doesn’t mean you’re immune didn’t it. positive Covid test basically guarantee Covid, rest assured it. Passive Antibody administration used infections like Rabies Probably, family December well mom cough lingered least 2 months finally testing negative COVID. (She also still can’t smell taste anything that’s different topic lol) briefly best. It’s form passive immunization trigger long lasting protection. long antibodies last bodies protected somewhat antibodies nkt Actively used die pretty quickly. phase one study? LOL will, personal responsibility alone end pandemic. need everyone part. dont need stupid policies go contrary end goal. need covid nurses understand help propagate message, rather taking selfish attitude, ""yeah guys hope works out"". Yup I'm hoping anti-vacc crowd also goes mRNA vaccines get riddled disease normal people essentially become immune diseases. 

This modern version extinction. Hypothesis - People worried spreading Covid others likely wear masks public + donate blood. People worried catching Covid going public all, including going blood donation center. edited post add extra info situation.

**Ferrer explained drop county receiving new single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine next two weeks, due “manufacturing production issue.” Reuters reported production would resume “later March.”**

While demand still exceeding supply, think really issue, need addressed end surplus one ""lesser"" vaccines. like switch calling Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine. think FDA lot tighter rules manufacturing Europe well prevent bad batches. Agree. I'm pro-vaccine vaccinated everything sun, yearly flu shot, chicken pox, meningococcal, measles - name it.

It clear form outset AstraZeneca weakest among available vaccines. rolled out, seemed encounter problems. Intrigued investigations find. get you’re saying, definitely looking it. Human trials vaccines going since last summer. I’m trial started October still report illness via app (even headaches runny nose) go hospital checks every weeks.

They rigorously investigating stuff, months, still now. Tens millions people vaccine now, people die way take random sample tens millions (largely older) people track time. number people suffering blood clots uk AZ vaccine actually lower background rate moment, numbers we’re talking low isn’t statistically significant. seems much like something similar happening EU; number people clots background level, we’re talking 10s people side effects 10s millions vaccinated. It’s likely statistically insignificant, even it’s likely similar level risk rare side effects see listed almost medications.

I don’t really understand countries it, recommending continue vaccinating, EU regulators haven’t suspended rollout, countries based seemingly 1 incomplete study anecdotal evidence. terms harm reduction it’s absolutely wrong decision, terms honest public fearmongering it’s wrong decision. Maybe it’s right decision focus single study ignore meta analysis studies, maybe it’s right decision vaccine rollout completely mismanaged need way spin news you’re going able vaccinate population time soon. really don’t know, absolutely seems like political choice rather evidence based decision reduce number people die become seriously ill next year.

I know would get AZ vaccine without hesitation. bad people never thought issue, know maybe something like weighted density would take account. source? Amazing. Thanks science, could able close last ward planet soon. wondering meant. I’d say danger point picky vaccine brands? heard that. like vaccine brands even known public. cars. heard conversations like ""my dad Moderna guy. grew getting Moderna. AZ losers""

I take whatever get. goes people reckon bro? good stuff you’re saying wild stuff like I'm panicking. live place single Covid case since August, somewhere community transmission entire pandemic. never wear mask pandemic.

I afford picky Covid vaccine choose have. Many others unfortunately luxury. unusual part combination. stat shows symptoms individually, interesting. 


I want source shows many patients expected symptoms, people 50 underlying health conditions. happened too, week got pfizer shot. wasn’t expecting symptoms beyond first 2 days tiny spot pain, way better sore arm was, good sign immune system responding! Moderna. Phase 3 trial. way back September another hiccup. Science things. general fear population could dangerous. Europpean countries playing safe agree measure tbh. least research regards virus blood clots. vaccine get? Paying others shots offering vaccine makes unprecedented access health data vaccination administered. Nothing wrong either wonder didn’t countess simple would worked. Would started bidding war countries don’t modern health infrastructure collect data. congratulate Israel amazing success. Surprising China investing billions Africa years now. 

I’m surprised haven’t rolled save day too.

All America seems give Africa bunch Bibles don’t need. No, side effects seem particularly severe case AstraZeneca one know experiencing vaccine.

It's rare types clotting seen countries cause behind rollout suspension across EU. That's huge reach serves purpose divide, kind seem love doing. Africa like one top 5 6 wealthiest continents world, don’t develop vaccine? see that, GA?! behind Mississippi... VP debate, Harris said “But Donald Trump tells us take it. I’m taking it.”

Regards think given reason different different countries. Sweden paused today specifically said paus hade nothing clotting. contrast Sweden's health agency claims number blod clots higher rest population. (They are, howerver, worried side effects.) Look south Jersey. That's got mine. 100 mile radius found it. Told people found too. NJ checking anything. know bunch people got shots eligible. Plus right place right time(end day) announce use anyone wants it. That's terrifying read disorder affects women ages 30 40 commonly. amount RNA, smaller vials huge ramping vaccine production. seems likely US produced 180-220 million mRNA doses + 20 million JJ vaccine doses end March! That's enough half adults. also, occur apparently predominantly Women ages 25 50, that's weird thing. looking cases really make sense 5000 tests one day 80k next. find ‘cases per 100.000 last 14 days’ seperare countries? Anybody know website daily updated numbers? Probably guard one. overheard co-worker saying want wear mask blocks carbon dioxide oxygen. said virus particle least million atoms larger gas molecule, mask designed stop virus molecules.

He understand trying say, asked invented gas masks paper mask could stop gas exchange well. realized argue that, got hella stupid pissed. Emphasis stupid, mostly said know talking about.

Before worked state, worked healthcare security five years. concurrently EMT half it. Trained used isolation procedures multi-weekly basis. sure, said. ""don't know I'm talking about."" complete bullshit since blood tested anyway. fucking 1980s?

My understanding havent changed policy batch test blood donations. Meaning put bunch samples together perform one test, positive throw whole batch out. Testing individual donation separately cost prohibitive compared taking donations high risk groups.

It moral issue, simply actuary somewhere math they're better selective. risk exceeds benefit. No, 400 k week. are, realize, correct, I'm editing Also bacteriophages well took four months Pfizer trials get enough evidence prove vaccine effectiveness, takes time volunteers placebo group get infected large numbers, told keep masking follow precautions. able recruit kind people party maskless time vaccine trials, probably could results months earlier. actual issues AstraZeneca. Russian bot definitely Russo-sceptic (fuck Vlad). AZ apparently killed young adults Germany nations europe suspended use. millions vaccines 

AZ doesn’t even deliver millions vaccines EU. 180M, got 5M.

Then Boris uses brexit ammunition caused precious Oxford vaccine begin with. ask someone antibodies bite you. precise opposite say true. EMA said evidence health issues caused vaccines. head Italy's medicine regulator called decision suspend political one. majority experts say reason suspend use. comparison antivaxxers laughable. fucking 1980s?

Everyone looking super carefully right now. fine. indication bad batches anything. headline misleading makes think plot EU something like that.

In actual interview director basically said reason suspect anything wrong vaccine, countries took different decisions end also influenced taking maximum caution approach. leaving rareness blood clots low platelets. Platelets needed clot. people clots low platelets, thereby blood thinners treatment clots much risky. please crunch numbers tell us often rare complication happens general population year. believe understand seeing ‘hysterical overreaction’ call it. results Novavax look promising. Great news. condition normally extremely rare, well one per million per year. clusters close proximity vaccination around tens cases per Million. that's evenly distributed across AZ applications would still reasonably small risk. clusters one wonder condition that, together vaccinations, increase risk *massively*. figure could unwittingly replicate conditions seriously harm many people. Clinical diagnosis - probably chest x-ray found variant show PCR tests last month. suspected mutate here. came heard get food candy pay blood.

Show way! may exposed virus second time recently. someone else mentioned, antibodies stick around long T/B Cells enables body quickly spin antibody production next time get exposed. Symptoms. know sure covid though Nice What? kits ""come back""... mix drop blood drop water special piece paper antibodies recognizing A, B Rh antigens. particular antigen, forms little clumps paper. don't. clumps form either B, type O. literally ""in between"" ""inconclusive"". limited amount adenovirus injection. infect cells within muscle group.That intramuscular vs intravenous vaccine. latter would target entire body. immune response effect whole body ie. fever, headache whatever else body thinks Covid hates.

You dont see UK going mass hysteria you? Hopefully companies scale production much phase AZ. lied bit much. do, freaked called donation said that's calling about. thought something wrong blood. Eventually, multiple calls driving interrupting meals, told politely could want donate regular basis, never donate help calling. last call received them. detected? No, combination serious symptoms people showed extremely rare hardly found general population all. Yes seems linked different batch/manufacturing. look thousands vaccinated cases denmark sweden, odds worse. Halting AZ makes difference EU gets hardly vaccines begin with. know get both? raise cows Patagonia, desert.  tell AB+ blood used for? donate sometimes go hospital's blood bank pick patient's PRBC noticed even stock AB+. I'm wondering happens blood donate? people issue away prevent it. pretty harmless many places give get hospital led bed day. also given pregnant people. common used drug. Thank you:) find blood clot data?

What missing age patient side effects.
As far know, AZ severe reactions occurred random, young people, case Pfizer.

I honestly see derail vaccination campaign UK. death Italy allegedly due thrombosis/DIC, fact caused thrombo-embolic hemorrhagic event all.

According Dutch minister health, really delivery vaccines curbs vaccination rate. signed supply agreement Serum Institute India supply 30 million doses Novavax country, likely [arriving] third quarter fourth quarter [of 2021],"" Galvez said Filipino virtual press briefing. Honestly worry cases might even linked vaccine, feel fine thats matters. There's like 15 million doses given UK vaccine without issues “Sociopathic traits linked non-compliance mask guidelines COVID-19 containment measures” come dude. never new connection doesn’t mean it’s sensationalized. It’s scientific journal! heparin dangerous, considering patients low platelet counts already? thread deleted “broken link” link fine unbroken. wife last week, came back inconclusive. different kind type test done. someone lives right next largest border crossing 2 countries, tell you, completely wrong. literally never stop calling you. tell died got annoying. prefer donate local blood services/hospitals. Well got batch 9 days ago. I'm sure worry more, me:d swedish says 1-2 weeks getting strange symptoms occur heard doublepsy cancels narcolepsy. Yes, sensationalism is. Describing something way wouldn’t normally order illicit views. doesn’t friends. Nobody calling jackals crew sociopaths unless they’re specifically Bam Margera. Adendum: btw, addition, position ISTH, international society Thrombosis Heamostasis, clear: people history thrombosis, anti-coagulation, strongly recommended vaccinated AZ vaccine, infection poses real risk. thrombosis. border literally closed air land foreign nationals exceptions regardless saying going quarantine lol. Yes, do. blocked number though, occasionally go voicemail delete bunch messages. It’s annoying get  definitely issue corruption.  main problem facing EU member states utilize different case definitions. first vaccination campaigns got suspended, even checked victims COVID-19. surprisingly, already seems case. death Italy allegedly due thrombosis/DIC, fact caused thrombo-embolic hemorrhagic event all. 

The data fucking DOGSHIT. suspended product proven save lives without proper investigation knee jerk reaction based terrible data (= unscientific). Yes, believe case. 1 million doses part one batch sent 17 countries EU. read yesterday 25 people Norway reported unusual bleeding issues last 14 days, government asked people report issues recently, one blood clotting low platelet problem hospitalized. 1 million doses spread amongst various clinics country course reaction going concentrated one area. Seems me, tell countries locate batch pull use, fine. Also, AZ could investigate admit it’s bad batch problem identified fixed, would build confidence vaccine again. fast adamant denials ever investigation isn’t helping. know several people afraid get second dose don’t feel like trust AZ now. good since high-risk people. Nope! scheduled second dose apt spot three weeks it’s already locked in. 3 cases exact hospital mean related vaccine. example, could also (with logic) say:

Microsoft Windows updated world weekend 3 people hospital developed blood clots. Hence, Windows update cause blood clots. realise literally entire post. point asked about. Rather answering actual question asked, chose write entire post distinction two types vaccines.

*As zero stakeholders deciding follow path, pretty much AZ?* Really? pasted exactly horrendously tone deaf response wrote thread topic? still easily get Canada though, long say going quarantine point sensationalized headline, no? call friend. Ill advised imo Yeah congrats Philippines, beat us it!

I guess EU liability issues again. mechanism EU would waive liability, like Emergency Use Approval. Novavax might refuse sign contract unless get rid liability way. least that's thought read [EU might introduce Emergency Use No, all, finding literally entire point pausing. get statistical point view, continuing vaccinations makes sense. hand, people think statistics people always put lives lives others. there's chance get serious health problems (or even die) health problems linked vaccine, understand people healthy reluctant get vaccinated moment.

Let's take following situation: young, healthy person following guidelines/precautions get COVID (social distancing, wearing masks, testing ...). First, need contract virus, already likely careful also need develop serious symptoms, afaik rather unlikely younger people. high probability young, healthy person avoid getting COVID dying it.

On hand, number people suddenly die various countries getting vaccinated connection vaccine, understandable people start doubting vaccine. there's chance health affected vaccine, healthy (young) adult, going think ""well, let's take shot anyway otherwise might get COVID, might develop serious symptoms might infect others."" 

As long there's doubt long cases thoroughly analyzed counteract doubts, people get AstraZeneca shot rather wait moment get Pfizer Moderna shot. means months vaccine choice, that's risk people willing take. Vaccinated - masks, social distancing, testing well restrictions still part daily lives anyway. vaccine also takes couple days actually work could imagine people think immune right away throwing precautions catching covid.

These two things contradict other. basically means EU could exported doses UK December January. shared exactly that. export control measure implemented, EU AZ doses exported anymore, UK finally AZ production lines up. wasn’t sure meant “the infection.” That's decision entirely course.

The best estimates [I’ve requires ~1.5 million/day first doses track every adult wants vaccination complete within May/June also lines president’s comments early July.

I'll wait, genius boy. wrong premise. AZ vaccine people worried, possibly one recent batches do. production quality control deficit production site worth investigating.

Say 100 batches produced worldwide since December. 99 batches 5 people problem sinus thrombosis, 17 million people issue. last batch however seems unusual 8 young, healthy people within weeks injected one batch show sinus thrombosis. last batch worth investigating? Including 99 batches fine statistic last batch make last batch fine, it?

It's standard procedure investigate potential production quality control issues. want vaccinated ASAP frustrating halt AZ injections, necessary case? better left uninvestigated 2 months turns really issue many people died regulators want halt vaccinations. skip protocol things. meshes closely every European North American population seropositive study I've seen compared contemporary total deaths. - typically around 0.6% IFR. Nice. rush thinking push get people one dose delay second dose. 

Those numbers heartening hear fir UK. Thanks. many studies say carry virus vaccinated. Mitigation essential many ways possible err safe side. 4 countries stopped using 1 vaccine already. saying really know know. sad. risk people 50 overweight obese huge. overweight obese single biggest factor getting severe case Covid. 85% people 50 hospitalized least overweight.

The goal stop death hospitalizations. BMI 25 much higher risk. Mississippi following science, state (Louisiana) Short answer: No.

Long answer: currently known variant. virus new can't really sure exactly antibodies immune system creates function yet, believe antibodies generally floating blood stream indefinitely beyond recent infection- could wrong think approximate figure they're actively present weeks they're first created, induced person gets reinfected.

If assume there's significant overlap people getting vaccinated people donating blood, would imply one five Americans likely donate blood *recently* infected virus that's around year half. That's incredible me, especially time hospitalizations declining rapidly. think vaccinations lot prevent unnecessary deaths protect vulnerable, think natural immunity infection could bring us herd immunity due inevitable reality everyone want able get vaccine induced immunity. Lighten up. It’s joke. problem Canada closing border Americans. UK age bands 80+ (And clinically vulnerable), 75+, 70+ currently around 50+, rush, invited letter post text message depending band, however uptake every completed age band 90%, 99.9% 70+.

The UK done approximately 10m AZ 10m Pfizer. Lol. case many years ago maybe. 
This country becoming rotten mess. say idiot cannot good person? major red flag me... cause example often leads discussions things never said...

hopefully good person,bye everything it. terrible mismanagement pandemic blame painting Brazil corner vaccines...not China, ""West"" either. vulnerable already mostly vaccinated, case numbers matter ones take hospitals likelier die already fully vaccinated early. main worry aggressive variants popping up. Especially read large group going vaccinate whatever reasons. Gives chance mutate. Might dumb question reason worried new variants vaccine shown work strains virus? People donate blood red cross aren’t necessarily perfect representative entire US Population, look numbers like certain context. wouldn’t use foregone conclusion 20% infected. They're going go back people use Abbott's murdering order excuse abdicate brains. Lying people vaccines preventing transmission instead looking (several) studies refute way trying scare people believing complying continued restrictions. He's barely lifted capacity limits, childcare full capacity visitation LTC allowed. doctor? Curious... lmao Please feel right. ethics site get pretty bizarre. Consider personal situation. like anyone get vaccinated yet. states, 65 still progressing. some, health issues essential worker get shots. places people still trying find open vaccination slot. lots people still waiting like elsewhere.

If Biden gives AZ doses now, Republican taking point every US Covid death Biden delayed access vaccine since sold/gave away. (29yo) live NY healthcare facility TN right unrelated reasons. I'm hoping something either state. Anything.

On better note, parents gotten first doses, dad's getting second week mom's probably getting second next week. I'll finally able go worry-free visit play dog. That's big deal, since barely got dog month pandemic loves chewing shoes visit (or playing tug war visit).  think rules might vary site. Maybe wait Idaho? 

I think states get request doses requests partially filled. Hopefully CDC start matching allocations demand — probably reduce number weekly doses give states larger increases. 

OR WA done well cases deaths, makes us vulnerable spring surge new variants. little pre-existing immunity. Still better MS... don’t think go well. cases deaths absolutely plummeting, million vaccinated state 4 million population, end May going overkill. Wow, thanks mate. Spoken like someone never CVST choice..in area lot openings daily 3. option Pizer, JJ. one day decide... think? agree since many won’t reach full immunity shots mid-end may Interesting, know - sadly sounds like irreversible damage stage. guess best hope bad batch vaccine, maybe bad timing something going happen irrespective vaccine. vaccinated I'm gonna lick every lamppost hug every stranger.  maybe reverse. Woahhhhh herd immunity numbers Congrats! 19yr old son &amp; got waste list doses 2/12. got 2nd shot Moderna last Friday. 

I'm excited you! Even violent offenders deserve medical care. consider overly cautious? like oxymoron. Curious, mean tragedy &amp; extra precaution seems justified. it? call around pharmacies area? Well, one locked home let's calm hyperbole, patriot. 
And guns completely banned take point.

Back point: asking ready stop sucking teat government wealth created people say despise. seem recalcitrant engage topic. 

Wonder why? Florida rolled dice came pandemic. restrictions barely zero. People wear masks properly enough effective. think lot people Florida already Covid theory quite possible got lucky put faith private sector think really depends look it. States less restrictions likely end deaths perhaps left better economic outlook. like trading lives livelihoods.  Even though it’s open ages daughters appointment two weeks out. demand actually high here. People getting it. know anyone getting 6.7% Canada today. So, essentially, nowhere near herd immunity vaccinations started. spitball estimate real fatality rate US - 0.17% population dead, 20% infected, 0.82% real fatality rate.

In order reach fringes herd immunity 60% population recovered infection, 1.5 million Americans would die. Congratulations mental health. I'm genuinely happy you. easy everyone. I'm depression/stress eater. drink, smoke, use recreational drugs; take emotional issues people... none counts, guess. dad died teenager, severely bullied, husband permanently disabled, I've anxiety whole life several major situational depressive episodes. I'm lucky! many people deal worse I've through. lost 45 pounds ago gained back last depressive episode, I'm trying lose again. could think people going thru eating. $3k deductible health plan. Therapy expensive. There's lot problems need addressed society order properly tackle obesity epidemic. WA still sucks. Schools open April 14 line sight get vaccinated Where’s cost benefit analysis this? pausing vaccinations telling us many lives expect save vs many lives would lost due getting vaccinated schedule. Show us numbers instead appealing expert judgement.  No, none true.

Edit: Ignore dude. posted deleted question askscience asking Covid could engineered. hope right...I really do. see Paris may lock &amp; Italy &amp; people anxious get back normal &amp; pray variants wreak havoc. well. Agree 100 percent sentiment. AZ would wasted here. I've heard people say they'll wait Pfizer/Moderna 90%+ efficacy rate reported, versus 77% J&amp;J. San Francisco vaccinating everyone BMI 30. Masks may seem reasonable many vaccines America shared? There's big line cross agricultural subsidies gun bans locking people homes. Exactly nationalizing healthcare shifts burden price. Instead taxpayer paying tbe vaccine, becomes responsibility government, needs get money taxpayer anyhow. 

What needs done setting limit much pharma charge per dose. Massive blood clot deaths incoming according sub Chill dude.

There still tens millions people want get vaccine can't due supply.

Once places run people waiting line vaccinate tv ads begging people get vaccinated running while, worry. revised 70m day two suspensions kicked in, never 40m. sure number came from. state would need make private enterprise illegal smart people tend go paid most. 

This tech, anyway. one wants government contracts. Don’t forget every time scientist publicly said news people didn’t like they’d called fired replaced whichever scientist recently told wanted hear. Quebec, Canada. guess total lockdown places closed, gatherings allowed all, strictly enforced 8pm curfew. Yeah, low chance dying covid low chance dying non-covid, possibly vaccine related. 

But actual numbers? sold cost duration pandemic. Afterwards? Nope. volunteered myself. Would volunteer babies. know it’s greater good that’s asking lot. last phase announcement 59 year old friend booked slot eligibility day. website put age 1 year over. think matters eligible day shot. I'm Canadian friends states. people talk lot online, younger (26), opportunities get vaccine already. current rollout plain Canada I'm going able get vaccine **7 months** :( seen big problem live. consider pretty responsible want get life back normal sooner rather later still see many people who:

- want get vaccinated. talked TWO friends know nurses opted get vaccine yet. believe would taken drastic measures get vaccine could. Fortunately got dose 1 yesterday.

- take virus seriously. wear masks. social distance. curtail activities like social events, eating out, etc.

I hope reach point consider life closer normal pandemic started think yet. It’s first mover problem. first states look reckless like it’s “too soon” anchor people’s minds “reasonable”. CA/NY drop restrictions four months they’ll seen moderate safe. It’s great news. lowers every single KPI used evaluate disease determine policy, whether it’s symptomatic infection rate, severe case rate, mortality rate significant amount. DeWine done tremendous job pandemic Ohio.  yeah, CDC estimated 25% end 2020 meaning we're probably somewhere around 35% considering bad January February. Yeah downtown (Seattle) last weekend - like 60/40 even crowded streets. Whereas winter like 99/1. There's definitely steep decline late. still get people wearing alone car middle park lmao alright finally wipe africa entire continent free space WHITE people cultivate. fuck sake conquests stop. Stop defrosting 80's right wing talking points. We'll fine. Deficit spending crisis necessary. may small sliver pork, actually quite good bill. Better most. largest chunks money go directly people need it. Interesting. seems Illinois given doses per capita either Michigan Ohio. Maybe higher demand Illinois ? ""Slow testing down!!!"" -US President start pandemic. websites still set 50 over. stated one night woke could hardly breath felt like every breath took someone rubbing sandpaper lungs.

Went straight hospital gave got x-ray. lungs full clots. really know heart attack would gone though heart.

They kept telling feel anything. OH could feel it. really strong pain killers Month lay due pain. fun sleep sitting up.

They never work got clots. bad roll dice guess. happy still could went differently. mean get cold, immunity builds maximum 2-3 days right? fighting billion viruses injection.

No, immunity maximum would longer sick. cold several days contract show symptoms, 7-10 days symptoms resolves. end body strong enough fight off. immunity 'building' basically whole time first entered body. curiosity, data much immunity one shot Moderna Pfizer? thr EMA investigation done? speaking governments. AZ knows get away questionable behavior. You’re making emotional decision scientific one. literally idea it’s safe children. That’s they’re testing it. There’s also way long term effects it’s been..... long term.  plenty drugs vaccines took decades pulled market. Pfizer heart burn medicine pulled cancer causing nearly 30 years market. situation fluid fast moving. would waste energy concerned restrictions 6 months future even month future. Rubbish, really believe countries like Nordics would stop vaccines politics? urge buy microsoft products increased? RNA sequencing wish states come specific metric use though. state said something like ""When 50% eligible population vaccinated, we'll ABC, 75% vaccinated, we'll XYZ"" would put positive reinforcement people getting vaccines. Instead become like ""Eh, guess we're good enough now"". point state opens vaccine distribution wider populations used metric quality state's vaccine rollout.

Appropriate metrics include % population vaccinated, efficacy hitting target risk high exposure groups, equitable distribution across race class groups. point, events show English reports next two weeks. Yeah tell hospital people list get vaccinated 60% called say it, regardless happens next.

This going cost many lives, EMA kept saying since minute 1 keep vaccinating unless evidence shows anything relevant today clear that, scientific evidence whatsoever stop vaccinations now, purely political.

I hope going impact things like 2011 did, thousands people going die communication vaccines change. Italy 3 deaths last week sponsored national newspaper vaccine deaths autopsies showing link, going kill people, fucking badly.  wrote simply isn’t true. yesterday, 37 cases DVT PE 5M doses given. That’s lower rate two conditions general population (about 1 1000). mean need vaccine? got covid wife kids get tested. reason. knew had. I'd imagine there's lot people like us would rather get brain scratched q-tip. didn’t feel anniversary horror chills saw someone video Animal Crossing spring events coming 🥴 love happening much faster expected, hopefully supply follows extra demand. Considering price blood able couple snacks juice box anywhere go. liquid worth printer ink. Thought hoax? Good thing they've got vaccines though..oh wait they've suspended one vaccines Pfizer doubled fertility killer would amazing least Pfizer deliver promise. actually know get order it. Less actor-climate activists flying country country private jets deliver lectures?

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone gets bent shape... I'm joking. hope vaccine confirmed safe investigation; next Thursday EMA report. Yeah, agree judgement needs stop vaccinated people. think place wearing masks (if want to) grocery stores unavoidable public fixtures, that's abundance caution. Given 98% children Sweden given vaccinations deceases like diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough polio number seems weird. 
I wonder worded question? believe CDC reporting 1 4.6 cases reported. chinese CDC said 8x many wuhan another seropervalnce study believe found also 8x many.

This great news, not? I’m sure mistakes made way restrictions. Yet without would worse today. Somewhere along lines there’s prevention also headaches. yes. vaccine precautions.. need work.

I'm clear asking There's difference judging someone cautious reckless. I'm trying develop empathy people who've thrown caution wind pandemic, hard much life we've lost past year. Europe vaccine distribution going astronomically slow right? Anyone else noticing steady decline people big cities wearing masks outdoors? (I've noticed Chicago Seattle specifically)

I mean majority people still wearing one, feel like like 65% people masking vs 90% two months ago. I'm also curious places institute ""mask recommendation"" May June since can't see mask mandates politically feasible anywhere everyone chance vaccinated. **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.

1) tracking really vaccinated
2) vaccines still carriers although asymptomatic
3) different vaccines much better job preventing asymptomatic carriers. J&amp;J probably worst. going say certain vaccinations count? Wow that’s rapid expansion. Something haven’t focused tho including BMI 25 pretty much opens everyone children followed year, look side effects measure antibody levels help researchers determine whether vaccine appears provide protection. 

Does mean we're looking vaccine kids March 2022 earliest? phase they'll move forward sooner data looks good? Meanwhile MD eating glue one states reserved 65 plus still.

Maybe critical voices there, generally could say whatever wanted, matter wrong was, without swedish media calling it.

Those us followed swedish press conferences, especially beginning, knows wait end critical questions. non-swedish media course. Every time.

That Swedes *trying* rewrite history mean true. literally comes report itself. good doctor give number.. That's great. least good new. 

Germany pretty-bad climate wise choice replace nuclear power coal need better things? silly question... heck would want improve things (in manner)?! Constant improvement brought human race become today...

There's certainly lot room improvement vaccines. I'd imagine substantially reduce flu-like reactions vaccine, reduce amount shots required one shot, different storage requirements, etc... 

The current vaccines good case pandemic still ongoing. compare vaccines ""great"" sense much higher normal chance side effects, ""severe"" vaccines, get it. chills, muscle aches, fever, nausea, etc. 

If thing truly stay permanent seasonal like flu is, doubt scientists make vaccine easy-peasy flu vaccine comes side effects (basically NONE) reducing one-shot vaccine. leave state every week, missing much. mean, it’s possible. genetic predisposition blood clots (though don’t genetic condition causes clotting own) genetic condition present 10-25% population. Maybe due 90% patchy

""Half serious COVID cases Arab Israelis, community’s vaccinations lag"" Palestinians perhaps - dunno? google EMA Emer Cooke make news alert. long now. press conference that's people know said. think seems far fetched vaccine would protect long covid. basically give immune system massive jump enable clear virus actually infects shortly after. see reason assume markers severe infections still around highly effective vaccine. like idea metrics. date seems like bad idea. metro, new hospitalizations stopped falling soft rise. set date based trend two weeks ago, would longer supported data. someone explain see PCR ? 

Are looking known pattern, meaning variant different enough would get negative result match look for, see everything ? Technically yes, don’t wait won’t turn away forced select invalid criteria long you’re eligible day vaccination. every family member announced new groups opening. Probably 5%, read something popping pandemic guessed based seeing vaccination programs gone. probably warped uninformed propaganda filled perspective American media. EU probably running great vaccination program. Next going tell problem EU run US ban exports. Despite White House press secretary explicitly saying US banning exports. probably article EU says US banning exports, able point anything US government banning exports. 

Ehhh...Your right, American exceptionalism. sad know joking not, I'm guessing not. that's wild.  La see anti-lockdown posts (which justified), anti-masks. I'm sure understand communism works probably meant socialists first place. It’s never common wear masks outdoors live. We’ve never state mandate local mandates always excluded outdoors. I’d say see 20-30% wearing masks outdoors, unless you’re specific private property requires masks (like Disney). agree, would much better around get close shutting thing can. absolutely terrifying Americans treated pandemic first. 

Trump ""no worse flu"" killed Americans Americans fought civil war, WW1, WW2.

All idiots told wear mask... just.... wow. anyone still thinks greatest country world absolute moron thing UK? would make 5% theaters?

I UK live America, ever recall seeing one UK, aware thing here. Vaccine + Convalescent immunity would make getting heard immunity level simpler. Russia China vaccines created for-profit setup.

Either risk bad reaction vaccine, risk catching Covid complications that. Drive theatres maybe? get though. risks COVID children low also zero similarly unknown extent. Nothing certain either way. US hasnt vaccinated single person AZ, dont get tired lying, you. Go google search ""The Cutter incident"" ""pandemrix narcolepsy"" might understand. Lethbridge? see available locations? doesn’t seem crazy given numbers state. looks like precautions still taken schools too. curious impact interstate travel along I-80 corridor be. lot people goods pass Wyoming, ramp road trip season interesting see there’s bump travelers stopping rest areas, truck stops, and/or stopping towns like Rock Springs Cheyenne meals lodging. Europe hasn’t vaccinated much serious question? aware the, least, superficial reason, want random Internet stranger give analysis? 

If Google “Astra Zeneca” flip News you’ll least get former.

Edit: I’m trying clarify helpful. reply wasn’t intended snarky. EMA finishing up. 30mins give report. AZ safe. plenty drugs vaccines took decades pulled market.

Care give example unsafe vaccine took decades pulled market? I'm aware examples sort. yeah Children Men favorite movie. There's also proof Oxford vaccine cause blood clots. eager get vaccinated next person, people really stop stubborn want find narrative they've pushing MAY actually turn wrong entire time.  Poor quality testing compared vaccines.

Cherry picking results try boost efficacy figures.

Not including varied enough age groups testing.

Lack transparency supply vaccines continually vastly overpromising delivering.

These reasons vaccine viewed scepticism. seems like fine vaccine despite shenanigans. dont give appearance trustworthiness thats way goes. Weird, maybe re-exposed, immune system more...sensitive? See link article University Alabama Birmingham regarding vaccine mRNA. would suggest consider sharing article them. current misinformation regarding vaccines infertility dangerous, completely baseless scientific merit. 

Here's direct quote article Jodie Dionne-Odom, M.D., associate director Global Health UAB [Center Women’s Reproductive infectious diseases consultant *American Society Reproductive Medicine*’s COVID-19 Task Force.

*“Some women hearing dangerous myths COVID-19 vaccine,” Dionne-Odom said. “In response misinformation, find helpful direct clear: scientific data supports link COVID-19 vaccine changes fertility. talk women interested becoming pregnant road, strongly encourage COVID-19 vaccination since offers best protection.”*

 No, PEI says figures include events 15th March. latest yellow card report include events 28th February. US, none us ever really lockdown- I'm California.

However, lifting existing restrictions constitute removal ""lockdown"" I'm sitting. wife time test positive igG, tested lab time watch conference, Emer Cooke seem pissed like thinking ""Why fuck dealing BS real issues deal with"". Almost 43 .... bring on. talking risk virtually nonexistent.

Ah, no, virtual nonexistent. 3 every 1000 people could slip through. want extrapolate, world gone rocker COVID CFR same. no, nothing politics everything math. point people concerned going get tired shouted down.

I've watching makeup comments subreddit change rapidly last month so. *Experts?* Many Americans one medical bill away bankruptcy. months plan mask up? I've never really looked flu season generally is.

This certainly need aware us, since certainly masking months. according brexiteers like you

That's right, anyone criticises European rollout must brexiteer...

You realise AZ deliver agreed doses UK time either? UK meant receive 20 million doses end 2020. failed meet target encountered unexpected problems production, something they, UK EU anticipated agreed would still make best reasonable effort get doses, taking profit, manufactured time, AZ failed EU UK hold responsible.

Nobody right mind would sign contract stand make profit would still subject legal liability completing. gotcha, exactly EU (and UK) real world civil courts, letter contract less important spirit it. 

Holy shit no, dangerous misconception have. courts always side wording contract anything else except extreme ambiguity. Society would collapse people could renegotiate contracts based feel said. cardinal rule contract law want something contract must write way. 

If AZ confidence contract would protect them, AZ would never agreed sign EU would look elsewhere vaccine doses. company never made vaccines before, hazard guess quickly could get production running, could never agree kind contract.

Like not, UK EU agreed AZ. AZ would best effort produce, profit, vaccine Oxford university created free partnered AZ deliver. truly great think AZ done, they're true heroes AZ ""the UK"" claim, means ""the UK"" directly responsible deliberately sabotaging EU's vaccine effort. would hostile act may even act war. better hope AZ actually ""the UK"", hm?

You sound like brexiteer. Talking war UK rather accepting EU messed up. get it, hard people accept makes furious? Nobody saying EU bad, fucked thing. Ursula Von Der Leyen hand... German could told terrible already. I've noticed bit Chicago. Outside early days people lot less certain things spread, really care much people wearing masks outdoors public spaces, avoid standing next unmasked person waiting cross street (I wear crowded streets side-streets I'm myself, obvious reasons). think going hard sell certain people keep wearing vaccinated, especially outdoors, suppose expected, IMO, really big deal. months ago winter Chicago imagine plenty people wearing outdoors reasons completely unrelated Covid (it's damn cold winter masks keep face really warm), also numbers really bad November - January, much better now. trolls trolling drop measurable levels months, body remembers make them! 

The reason second moderna/Pfizer shots boost duration antibody production. Texas reopened month see spike spike I'd re-opening

How perspective take account Florida less open 6 months? OK, good clarification. thought I'd seen Brazil contract valid pandemic, they've done that, that's excellent (not stuff done already also excellent, is.. SII going in) sound selfish, really wish young people could start getting vaccine soon. They're already making billions. country ordering ten hundred million going cheap, especially they're paying overprice get first. $50 bucks person lot consider economic gains single person vaccinated. AstraZeneca delivering  places still lockdowns ,. ?

Not Florida, hosted Super Bowl. spike (and wasn't) we're good. going matter much. vaccine rollout slow due lack vaccines. catch up. got second Pfizer dose yesterday. Aside sore arm, I'm A-OK. still enough vaccines available Yes, worry second point happening right spark perceived increase prevalence doubt juicy media. varied! sister said could barely move arm first shot. course anecdotes evidence heard shot #2. NY hospitalizations increasing. Like 100+ added day.  totally understand Canada hurry hoards irresponsible Americans come pouring now, especially given collective behavior worst pandemic. 

I know others work retail seeing,but area masks ditched customers coming coughing me. large portion vaccinated yet. I'm exhausted idiot culture. Let government take control vaccine emergency move send Pfizer packing. Fuck them. 

This equivalent person owns water source drought discussing make money. Rotten human trash. Money important people. Russia, China, Singapore, Sweden, France I'd agree, strictly epidemiological standpoint- Fauci coming from.

From public health economic standpoint, disagree Fauci support reopening.

It's balancing act sure, think right one. vaccines 


No. mean clear say science behind it. I'm saying still effective policy regardless affects people's behaviour. issues vaccine pausedfor normal blood clots. extremely rare ones normally. conspiracy theorist wonders competition involved amping concerns. EMA never responsible halt vaccine campaign. opinion never changed. Good Germany taking precautions necessary. 7 individuals 50 severe symptoms statistically significant. political fight here, blood disease experts scientists unified agreememt suspend Aaz temporarily. Shame accuse germans, norwegians use political tool undermine AZ second shot people said gives side effects. 1.6 million doses today. Slight increase last Tuesday. Nobody knows Yeah mean either way still wrong, sure downvotes. Pretty sure vaccinated 500,000 people Saturday alone something crazy like that. keep expanding tiers. April really surprised every adult wants vaccine doesn’t access it. also ton J&amp;J helps, got mine mass vaccination site (Dodgers Stadium) humming really easy believe pandemic created pharmaceutical companies. hard sleep night mine. incredibly excited anxious whole thing. Also stressed needed sleep it’s recommended get great sleep helps body build immunity. 

I recommend relaxing evening night before, alcohol, take melatonin, drink caffeine free tea whatever calms down, go sleep nice early. Bruh, Obama stockpiled H1N1 vaccine 2009 banned leaving U.S. Soil, like even possible sell E.U. Awesome, might something place. I'll shots time go. really nice. They're extremely careful due series unusual cases blood clots. Everyone agreement vaccine cause blood clots, concerns might due contamination. 
 
Some people think conspiracy amount people blood clots lower normally would be. However, apparently something unusual it. 
 
It's likely nothing, flagged right thing suspending it. doubt going affect vaccine rollout much likely able catch since entire holdup due vaccine shortage. one said AZ unsafe. saying example Norway faking concerns political gains? doctors never seen symptoms lying? blood contains potassium benzoate. already profiting this, Pfizer sold cost. extreme, clearvto see posts like conspiracy theory comments get upvoted others downvoted. Every one family got Moderna one us issues aside sore arm. Ouch. hurts  already making profit. price gouging goods people may need live. Theres difference saying instead $20 it'll $25 saying instead $20 it'll $200 $2000. Imagine water company said ""hey we're one town want running water pay $50 gallon""

Like going running water? Nobody wants rush it, mean important. Letting COVID bounce around big population would terrific way breed vaccine-resistant strain, sure shit want again.  Ehhhauu fond ol noodle poodle? thinker tinkler? snoozer hooser? thing ""profiteering"" free market. Pfizer hikes price? Cool, we've got Moderna, Novavax, AZ, Sputnik, J&amp;J take mantle.  could face couple strong Republican challengers 2022. Adam Kinzinger appeal across parties even though obvious group despise last days. Rodney Davis thrown idea running governor he's survived every challenge he's downstate district keeps getting bluer. Illinois fully reopened time starts getting challengers knows that. Oh wait minute! random guy thinks knows world-class experts field immunology.

I think hard time sciencing, okay. say things, something close things that's utterly confusing you. hard know, I'm side. True, also Austria head (with EU commission) Joint Procurement Scheme.

The vaccination pace exactly humming along Texas either. Sometimes sucks big state. vaccine. apparently 3 7 died younger , high risk age severe Covid case . Norway fuck up? people dying AZ vaccine? anybody freaks out, expected, happened before.

Certain tests going recalibrated (already been) every stage, spectrum methods even catalysts detect Covid reasons.

That said, whatever mutation observed occur one strain considered possible occur anywhere else world, recombine strain like B117, P1, etc, become transmissible harder detect.

Testing, masking, vaccinations--all things together best chance stopping 'invisible' strain sneaking maybe jumping plane neighborhood near you.

Be smart, part. think point need make public declaration wrong get treatment. fucks driven shit point gotten.  Actually one points investigated. results different countries different? suggest local batch issue rather general issue AZ serum. it’s batch issue, potentially dangerous, good reasons investigated. Nothing political this. Got mine yesterday, arm mildly sore, woke morning great reception though. know you’re able like see cell signals around you...? Jealous Washington 😭 still mask town U.S.A Washington D.C, least 9 ten people still wearing outside. 

DC data driven policies imagine policies change data changes. medical industry 99% profit research. don’t research something can’t profit off, even might save million lives. Every step, someone MBA asks cut costs make profitable. always profit. 

How justify this? lose money, go business, people suffer. profit #1 #2. U.K. cases too, statistically similar clotting issues general population, rightly ignored think ‘safer’ accurate. in, it’s safer protect deadly virus known kill people reject grounds 0.0006% chance get blood clot. never really use term ""movie theater"" UK, I'd doubt would included 5%. theater exclusively place would go see live performance us.

Unless mean drive-in ""actual""-theaters, literally never heard thing anywhere. supply issues still, well ongoing contractual conflict state, Blue Cross Blue Shield, counties control vaccine administrative process. wouldn’t surprised CA one last states open eligibility way. hand, I’ve also heard rumors (take grain salt) already plans open soon early April. We’ll wait see guess! Russian technology &amp; production never problem. government. Plasma expensive. Appreciate it, I’d gladly! reason state cannot hire people give resources make them.

The state never pay high private corps will. could get high skilled altruistic people lot high skilled people end day want money lower pay typically lower skill get. That’s unfortunate. We’re giving politicians claimed virus fake vaccine we’re ignoring bulk populace needs it. state in? try find info you. experience, pharmacies/clinics tell shot getting appointment sign-up Oh fuck off. bloothcloths many are. unusual cases developed related blooth cloths. 

Try again. frustrating plateau / slight decline New York going begin drop again? Hopefully soon vaccinations ramping up. Without vaccines, bet we'd seeing wave right now. Sometimes timing.   Ah. mean perhaps ""unclean batch"" UK started administering later Germany? One theory I've heard long haulers experiencing symptoms lingering infection body can't quite recognize enough fully fight vaccine big enough signal show body needs respond thus fighting lingering infection.
We empirical evidence (yet?), least plausible idea. I'd love see larger study plenty people could participate. 
There good study designs evaluate long covid symptoms / post-viral syndrome able use designs investigate further.   Someone it...

The argument made adults seniors participated trials COVID vaccines (and really, drug trial) knowing adverse reactions died, would greater good humanity statistic (with placebo) would end way vaccine approved, thereby saving hundreds thousands others, millions fate.  remember UK first decided prioritize first dose, America Slaoui Fauci incredibly since deviated vaccines trialled. looks like paid UK though. Yup. I've managed get four people signed relative ease. Took persistence one case, rest just: find site, sign up, agree drive them.

check /r/CoronaVirusPA havent already everyone thinks that, people love free stuff! volunteered blood drive staff told always got interesting characters donate gave away free shirts Yeah, argument single centralized healthcare authorities, run public good (not profit), LOT higher bargaining power things like this. one purchasing block entire US, said pfizer 'We absolutely buy vaccine increase price', Pfizer going huge amount pressure raise it, due size market would losing. Individual pharmacies / Doctors offices / Hospitals / etc. purchasing doses, advantage. According article saying think difficult conclude yet. even try google posting this? Took 1 minute find could either order pick day hardware stores. five years every week, difference negligible anyway. Basically open everyone May. guess possible happen vaccines sure big concern is. end hte day Pfizer private company going operate like one. really expect anything different. free market possibility government mandating taking China 0 daily Covid deaths this. issue happens within 15 mins magically better.

You remember two groups people.
1. People physical long covid 
2.people mental long covid 

People group 2 “cured” act vaccinated. happen mins overnight. People group 1 “cured” reaction body tk vaccine. would take days group 1 tk “cured” mins. takes lot mental effort remember nonsensical numbers instead place origin. see numbered list variants, usually Google them. virtually one calls numbered name... neighbors know U.K. variant is, though. 

Right wrong, that’s language tends work. 

People try take personally. 🤷‍♀️  fairness, South Africa paused AZ vaccinations due poor efficacy first. 

Due excitable reporting since largely debunked study. vaccine since demonstrated reasonable efficacy current variants (as expected, T-cell response substantial AZ's data showed one worst-in-class efficacies. 

Based US, FDA grant EUA based AZ conducted.

The FDA routinely accept results trials conducted countries, AZ yet applied US (they've awaiting results US Phase 3 study). HPV vaccine eliminate persistent infections, particularly weird. happen viral infections, precedent mechanism. don’t know, help community, society, country, world? 
 
I don’t mean sound trite, nearly every medical development rely required testing others. way see it’s turn. Politics really makes people act irrationally. Sorry, stated title. AstraZeneca vacciene question I'll 1,600,001 later today! HPV vaccines known eliminate persistent infections, known mechanism happen.  batch problem? highly unlikely. brand problem likely. states opening, faster better, want to. gotten vaccines people places like WA OR, reducing restrictions regardless. Yes  fear worry around COVID children warranted early pandemic. 

But evidence coming 1) children severe effects less often seasonal flu.  2) children lower transmission vectors adults. 

So vote want, facts children, COVID-19 less serious seasonal flu.  given current progress made distributing vaccines adults, even less pressure one available children.

Two months business closure death knell many places edge. difference making rent homelessness many. trivial all, two months business closure normal times would enormous decision.

I think waiting prudent, think need strong, strong evidence justify it. Saying, ""what's two months?"" extremely dangerous likely comes place incredible privilege. actually complicated this.

The Pfizer Moderna vaccine different storage requirements normal vaccines flu vaccines J&amp;J Covid vaccine. also risk anaphylaxis, typically happens within 15-30 minutes receiving vaccine. reason least one EMT paramedic vaccination sites. pharmacies EMT/paramedic site.

Since vaccine production distribution lags demand vaccine, makes much sense centralized distribution sites limit breakage/loss unused vaccines. long Americans still choose vaccine get (I haven’t heard terribly difficult Florida far), fine. Come try sell vaccine. 

Now AZ forced us way, shape, form, see strong pushback coming public already hesitant. think true vaccine, especially AZ given ongoing clot drama.

Yeah, imprecise language exactly went rabbit hole thinking thought prostitution disqualifying condition.

I also chuckle little bit think practice prostitute thing applies straight people. Granted, policy, sex gay prostitute, matter he's prostitute. normal vaccine rollouts would cut risk significantly progressively stepping age vaccine approved for.  Start 16 older. bad effects approve 14 older. bad effects approve next younger age group. 

That released vaccines young children. Jumping straight giving young kids risky comment alludes to. whether vaccine risky covid question determines whether risky rollout method justified.

The vaccine could perfectly safe fine, cause conjunction another medication contaminated production. 

Also, Paul-Ehrlich Institut (Germany's agency vaccine safety) published today, translated addition experts Paul Ehrlich Institute, experts thrombosis, haematology adenovirus specialist consulted details reported cases. experts unanimous opinion pattern recognised connection reported diseases mentioned AstraZeneca vaccination implausible. They’re wrong I’ve come understand thanks guys :) ahead get one worried COVID wear around religiously. demand others wear mask benefit.

 Finally, common sense.  Response article German newspaper Translation: Paul Hunter Norwich School Medicine University East Anglia, example, convinced PEI’s calculation. cites least two clinical – pre-pandemic – studies since 2012, one Australian one Dutch, indicate higher incidence specific sinus vein thrombosis general population: two five cases per million population per year outdated figure, said. “It underestimates incidence factor four eight.” Australian study assumes 15.7 cases per million year, Dutch study 13.2 cases per million inhabitants year. studies also showed incidence even higher people 50, said. Hunter: “With that, would expect one two cases per month. sinus vein thrombosis likely least common Europe previously expected

these numbers cited studies derived pre-pandemic. Covid infection strongly associated various vascular disorders, associated SVT literature-- true background number might expected higher, even one case cerebral thrombosis observed J&amp;J trials, sample thousands vaccinated (turned unrelated) months ago Reddit, statement lockdowns met anger lots downvotes. Also, never said anything politics. Stop putting words mouth create hostility. 

Its simply result slow moving policy changes span back 80s. 80s, HIV tests extremely inaccurate. they're one accurate blood tests perform. since there's appeal emotion, blood donations centers hesitant come fire people like think know actually reality they're following emotions. Enlighten ignorant oh enlightened one  that's medication taken chronically, something someone took gave cancer. happened medications past sure, vaccines though. got mine Sunday morning. 6 hours after, headache chills, moments intermittent nausea. lasted 10 hours, woke yesterday morning body sore pretty tired/weak. Weirdly enough, skin felt...tender? yesterday...like super sensitive.

Today feel really good, despite sleeping well last night (not vaccine related, kiddo woke 4 nightmare basically get back sleep that). point seem sore arm reminds get flu shots.

No fever point. reference, I'm 36 year old woman. general consensus seems younger folks women active/stronger immune systems, likely side effects.

It worth it! UK giving AZ older people likely pill anymore starting get age groups . Pfizer, company going back nearly two centuries employs around 100,000 people, currently makes 50% active ingredient doses, spokeswoman said, half produced medium-size BioNTech. BioNTech spokeswoman said company fact producing 60% countributing significantly manufacturing new facility capacity ~750M doses per year ready coming weeks. Knowing Ohio, high percentage anti-vaxxers means pretty much give away anyone take it? Honestly, waiting scientists ""certain"", check back decade.

It's gamble course, odds favor.  200+70+35+55=360. suppose EU accounting ~60m 'expected' under-deliveries?

J&amp;J also single dose, kind-of 'counts' two doses.  search papers ifr. best data could find said .2%-.3% (this actually cdc's estimate). certainly 1%. May public health officials begging people get shot. Biden administration ordered doses accommodate 400m+ people 330m US 20% take it. correct. websites form get scheduling. affirmation eligibility. 

This due lag updating websites. age limit went 60+ 50+ 59 YO friend put wrong birth year booked date eligible. walked Pharmacy, checked ID course date official rule 50+ fine. 

My interpretation (not lawyer) eligible GET shot, SCHEDULE shot. could also wait days websites update. yes...? want reduce allocation using them, point next weeks supposed allocations increase dramatically, states using getting more. Seeing states still thousands open appointments open everyone others still 65+ waiting appointments. Weeks vs. Years. Again, repeated ad nauseam. umpteenth delays reporting can't go day day terms hospitalizations. compare Tuesday last Tuesday, shows decrease. Pfizer execs Pfuck admit 50 dollar figure underestimate meant rile people up. State funding make easier states spend money systems vaccination. sending money FEMA. Still though, wish people stopped stingy one single thing get us mess. Thank god end like Europe spent way long negotiating contracts AZ would cost. stingy trust issues populations, something like 75% AZ vaccines unused 1/3rd shots us per capita. Look Washington see well goes. tiers changed constantly suit whatever desired political outcome is.

But guess make vaguely data minded people feel better  Low effort troll, get new hobby. look map vaccines available pharmacies Ohio. Appointments hard come urban areas, open many rural areas. pattern holds pretty much every friends parents sent bunch articles new covid variants comments saying ""this far over"" - anyone words articles send friend caused spiral bit :( I'll honest. much hate wearing masks hospitalization rates going great news, still think little soon.

I'd say least May June, March tho? I'm sure. could wrong. Sure live New Mexico, honestly think we'll probably lift restrictions even come close meeting goals outlined open back up. goals set mine states # cases per 100k population. Given pediatric vaccine, never get number, likely never able open current guidelines. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, good guidelines, think really important listen data ears ground. Hospitalizations ER visits 90%, vaccine rapidly dispersed large numbers. current trends likely continue, represents significant change things looked implemented guidelines -- time look dramatically altering winding based upon think likely coming next weeks months. specifically refused funding US government vaccine development could stay independent

Pfizer even develop it. BioNTech (which got funded Europe) outsourced big chuck clinical trials, production distribution them. Sinuthrombosis 

Oh wow.  Quoting numbers expect really showed everyone. /sarcasm  bad covid actually causes this.  take yearly incidence rate feed wood chipper. VA also 65+ pre-existing conditions, cheers up. heading point hospitalizations going faster faster every day

This objectively false. I'd like see sources this. Please back claim up. I’m actually glad live republican state given handle pandemic Cuomo’s update posted twitter mistakes? SOME? Unless variety appears jumps vaccine cause another lockdown UK, does, see reason , everything place now, could administer booster shot everyone 8 weeks. Pfizer's production problems nowhere near AZ's, least European perspective. less severe, faster fixed better communicated. initial problems, aiming deliver even initially ordered Q2.

At time AZ cannot even keep already greatly reduced timetable, meaning even deliver half promised first two quarters 2021. People keep saying like true even makes sense. isn't! doesn't! bigotry? straight man, situation ""I can't donate blood sex last week,"" mention link provided Wikipedia link series ""discrimination.""

It's 2021, 80's. time end bans make can't donate blood sex last 3 months **for everyone.** stand appropriately upbraided humbled forgetting musical communities exist parallel reality comparisons strengths weaknesses simply happen owing ""toxicity"". listen recordings Plattsburgh High Symphony Orchestra cello soloist, esteemed venerable Steve. want hurt anyone's feelings...  see that?? going week week. umpteenth delays reporting can't go day day terms hospitalizations. what? data comes unreliable source.

This fucking rocket science here. don’t care love America not. care brits slightest slight increase better decrease. chooses sell profit people literally dying dehydration. think helping posts like this, not. Sad say that’s main reason I’m getting vaccinated. rather die covid spend rest life without ability taste. Lunch. however looking forward week work going miss get sick second vaccine unequivocally untrue. eligibility limitations sexual contact place straight people all. sexual health related disqualifications actually contracted STD yes, there’s deferral period treatment. STDs course irrespective sexuality. I’d like also point deferral period MSM 3 months regardless monogamy. Meaning 1 HIV- sexual partner 15 years still abstain 3 months donate blood (until recently, 1 year). policy discriminatory. 

Here’s eligibility requirements Red giant rodent (username checks out)... happily signing this. Nice, thanks reassurance michigander, Gov Whitmer announced date, knew Ohio would try one us. case, totally cool yall so. Thalidomide never FDA approved US. People getting abroad taking illicitly morning sickness. 

Idk you, personally, makes trust FDA *more*. 7.1 million doses distributed today us, damn pretty good. Okay set big bingo game except show it’s bingo it’s vaccine clinic. even vaccinated yet yes will. inb4 ""In (x country) I'm 112 year old surgeon cancer eligible"" Greedy &lt;insert swearword choice Facebook groups probably least reliable source could consider though.

I say ""right youtube comments"" realized much FB actually used promote anti-vaxx propaganda, probably really worst source. :o

Edit: clear, I'm fully pro AZ-vaccination. figure? definitely board getting kids signed up, far away me. I'm big girl, nice healthy hemoglobin count, issue there. alyx double red donation returned plasma experience fine, however next week so, incredibly fatigued work found going sleep pretty early. 

Obviously happen everyone, people aware bit long tail impacts losing 2 units red blood cells body replaces them. Congrats! sure stop big-mac meal way appointment. right line! :) I’m fine continuing masks months, everyone wants vaccine get one. 

But let’s pretend there’s anything normal seeing people’s faces. masks need go soon too. life allowed shop face mask on. That’ll catch 55-65 year olds, groups older that. older folks got vaccines family members setting appointments driving them. ones left mostly don’t anyone them. vaccine move emergency use authorization normal authorization? costs 50 dollars get two cold burritos delivered via uber eats.. Trust me, costs 50 bucks vaccinate given person add scheduling, site safety, cost labor, cost vaccine time spent actual person getting injected. typical pennywise poundfoolish thinking. We've spent almost 5 trillion dollars pandemic, day arent back normal 10 billion dollars substracted GDP. spending 100 dollars per person ended pandemic 1 week sooner would well worth measure. get big buzz drinks (much) later day/night! 2 drinks blitzed.

I'm going first person immediate family get vaccinated! Appointment Friday! six year old niece wants come reason. U.K. mostly using AZ Pfizer.

UK used 10 Million Pfizer doses. end February Pfizer still ahead AZ though think AZ might overtaken now. Can't find current read somewhere UK govt stepped help Australia , know happened form help was? figure probably correct similar numbers saw Moderna approved. 85% sitting shelf vaccine refusal, it’s slow logistics, bad planning poorly defined groups vaccinated. arguing one. Look comments. dummies hear INVESTIGATION - part state vaccine continue used. Italians stole locked closet. war together. Vaccine raid!

Hmm would offer buy them, way least get something kinda persuades give us. dream comments deleted.

It great then, need vaccines. But... know nothing variants efficacy vaccines? it’s dead. didn’t escape husband. read article?  talking delays result AZ shipment delays, suck, that's completely unrelated delays result France completely halting roll-out. becomes endemic... means herd immunity achieved vaccination. 

Now, become endemic, vaccines still mostly effective, become less severe less lethal time? maybe becomes serious common cold years. 

Or go direction? virus keeps mutating become severe, lethal... makes vaccines less less effective. Well US's approach 'do know work first time'. know yet ramifications UK strategy. Maybe difference, maybe efficacy drops slightly, maybe efficacy drops lot. Crazy, almost like small businesses cause hospitals collapse. I’ve got Wow - map super frustrating look green circles.

For 1 available appointment entire state (and Rite Aid probably gone already) Increasing service frequency/# vehicles, adding routes, etc. = less crowding given bus subway car. new concept. Here's [one many. Mate, it’s psychology article.

Seriously? actually looked traits they’re referring also traits shared dozen diagnoses, among Autism

The paper specifically investigates antisocial personality disorder traits. Read know damn well they’re saying sociopathic versus antisocial.

I think real issue ignorance + chip shoulder. local leaders’ issue weeks, Gov Wolf Health Secretary blow smoke asses say distribution equitable. OK. exactly hope accomplish comment? fill yourself? think anyone handwriting analysis these. Theyre bad. one state knows whats like NFL team regularly humiliated season them. Italians stole locked closet. (Aus)

We war together. Vaccine raid! Never understood don’t pay blood like European counties...doesn’t much incentive 15 years younger eligible? fuck?  Covid also much infectious flu, even variants, ""letting 'er rip"" precautions kid populations result many infected seasonal flu, therefore kid health problems, even per-infection risk similar. also drive societal infections (see e.g. also know long term health consequences -- adults even mild Covid long term health issues portion infected. Subjecting kid also worry. Death whole story Covid. argument - PA used 78% delivered vaccines ranks near bottom.

Looking looks like huge benefit would shift vaccines Pittsburgh Philly areas. Come Maryland, waiting for??? lol

It's also paternalistic. people ""better"" ""worse"" based race. memes humans ""deserve"" dogs based kindness loyalty? post responded read like that. Vaccinations absolutely prevent infections. Unequivocally. that's fair, everyone different risk tolerance. 

unless i'm misreading though looks like chicken pox tested across children's ages simultaneously. primary polio vaccine study way (not small 2nd grade study, 750k study). bother checking others.

do source vaccines used step approach? clearly shows Pfizer pay 100% ... 

“BioNTech use grant funding cover expenses related COVID-19 vaccine program BNT162 within funded project order advance clinical evaluation “ man, heard side effects all. one case.

I’d first line (among many, many others) people/demographic sub changed dramatically past month huge amount people think like already left. RI age 16-36 still slated early/mid June (but currently open underlying health conditions).

There's way stays is, think they're seeing numbers demand making announcement right now. disputing assertion Canada poses special threat USA vice versa.

What absurd unrelated comparison indeed. bad! Sorry don’t get point. 

“BioNTech use grant funding cover expenses related COVID-19 vaccine program BNT162 within funded project order advance clinical evaluation “

It clearly states money used advancement vaccine... Whatever living, I’m way better it. dice RI :/ far we're [not track make adults eligible May nevermind month next. saying didn’t put large enough order? options:

1. EU didn’t order enough 

2. Pfizer isn’t making enough

3. Someone stole vaccines / Pfizer failing deliver contracts make sense even surface level.

They providing us anything new.

They're giving back, sure. Literally Indian-Giving. America🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 false claim. refusal certain countries groups AstraZeneca set narrow, opened vaccination everyone, supply would gone within seconds EU countries. colleges vaccinated AZ Netherlands, huge lines people offered AZ GP offices (due age 60+) Ate inside chipotle yesterday first time year felt like break room Better news expected huge lift German News say females 20 50 group mostly effected blood clotting given AZ.

Could also coincidence, since sample size small. one year ago today received text message employer saying CEO enacted work home.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Pfizer never supplier, also rely companies AZ. Given US 10x population numbers meaningless alone. Russia really wants us take masks 

Or possibly people think you’re wrong literally coronavirus subreddit, poorly informed? all. low risk, I'm mostly happy see death cloud start gtfo here. Good thing PA fucking distribution leap faith? Fauci CDC said multiple studies shown safe. they’re analyzing data. Sounds like official announcement soon. aren’t following science?

It’s much distance precautions. saying kids won’t wear mask!? EU behind giving vaccines many Pfizer vaccines?? true. Read fucking links. 

“Up 375 million” that’s manufacturing capacities late stage trials only. 

From link: goal initiative expansion vaccine development manufacturing capabilities Germany, well expansion number participants late-stage clinical trials. US lucky leaders actually manage get vaccines people's arms fast possible! Sadly, Europe vaccinated snail's pace... number meaningful. Imagine pipe delivering water. really care percentage water currently pipe? water ""wasted""? care rate water coming pipe? put bigger pipe, amount water inside pipe go up, able deliver water.

As far opening eligibility, criterion whether appointments going unfilled want someone high priority. scheduling system smart, open groups still giving high priority people first crack, worry able get they're ready. really shouldn’t calling brand new technology it’s studied years. Hey dumb ass. virus going endemic. actually good news. Given fast US producing vaccines, capacity eventually benefit rest world. US seems making 100 million vaccines month US market saturated (I assume mid end May) global effort vaccinate least go bit faster. Biden wants everyone wear masks everyone vaccinated.

We good go sometime late 2022. “Up 375 million” that’s manufacturing capacities late stage trials only. 

From link: goal initiative expansion vaccine development manufacturing capabilities Germany, well expansion number participants late-stage clinical trials. Yup. Plenty countries run nincompoops would take hands. matter damage already done. Poll French view AZ vaccine, 20% trust vaccine, 58% trust rest factual, 100% death prevention actually true shown examples fully vaccinated people died Israel example. close 100% 100%.

Some trials zero deaths placebo arms, would say placebo 100% rate preventing deaths? Yes, slowly reopening, non-essential stores opened month ago, cinema 2 weeks ago, MTL gyms opens back march 26, curfew probably pushed 9 9:30 (announce today), maybe reopening also.
But private gathering still banned.
Cases still slowly getting down, hospitalizations also vaccine rolling vulnerable hope small outdoor private gathering permitted summer, like last summer. true Vaccine passports kind fly face personal freedom values countries pretend hold high regard. low iq Tears happiness! Honestly amazing hoarding TP time last year we're here.  375 million Euros Germany. wouldn’t say completely it. started good Dr. Acton resigned since walked line politics science. Going back mask mandate April political move. curfew instead full shutdown political compromise. said, we’ve faired much better GOP led states get points there. Yep, never hug nana according some. It’s like whole world forgot already risk life. None could defined reasonable person ""surge"". Fuck staggering incompetence put display last twelve months throughout many countries mind boggling, get weekly blood draws part test. 

I don’t know kids cool that. parents willing subject kid kid doesn’t want weekly blood draw?

I’d want kids it. don’t think could.  thrombocytopenia ever mild asymptomatic? always lead clots stays like long?

However, looking incident rate 20 cases split 110 million doses (so around 40-50 million first doses) compare Norways 6 severe cases 125k doses. AZ significant higher risk thrombocytopenia blood clotting. I’m sorry loss president want upset Chinese friends. freedom drive statistically infringes lives pedestrians walk. Maybe need qualify statement odds, point people make fighting back 100% safe requirement. mention masks aren’t perfect risk still present. making nearly enough May timeline though. Unless nearly double doing, pretty similar whole month far distribution. difference say New Mexico Indiana, suspect may partly function different states scheduling easy/possible third party integrate system. New Mexico appears [centralized registration sends registration codes people allowed attempt schedule appointment, might hard third party web site integrate type system.

For urban vs rural distribution, major problem hard people reach rural vaccination sites travel times much longer fewer transportation options. see thing New York, vaccination sites located far away NYC easier get appointments at, they're soooo far apart. I'm hoping fix moving beyond centralized ""vaccination site"" model required right due logistics mRNA vaccines distributed model small amounts J&amp;J kept stock huge numbers pharmacies urgent cares doctor offices rural folk easier time getting vaccines. Obviously really speak much vaccines allocated urban vs rural areas right now, would surprised states throwing doses sites using them, much encouraging people sign appointments induced send doses sites order address urban-rural disparities. maybe I'm wrong! Mississippi's lot fatter Maine though. Thanks never knew groups like existed. multiple clots last may still cry think close death felt. Nah, heard news. couple weeks old info too. really high time reported result people missing appointments hesistency overall. Could also number differs country country. Could also wishful thinking 😂😂 gather, antibody response Sinopharm vaccine hit-or-miss many people, they're administering third doses high-risk groups ensure likely suffer hospitalisations sufficient protection. article detailed, one eh, causal fallacy.

This like states say covid deadlier minorities ignores context.

The link lies within multiple variables stem socioeconomic status, necessarily lack health insurance. end day, age still biggest factor determining severity outcome. scroll bottom there's bar graph doses per quartile. We're 2.3 mil doses per day usually around 45-70k, 90k last day! (I'm keeping track chart). Estimates suggest 1/3rd people LA already COVID. 

21.6% California least one shot vaccine, apparently SoCal prioritized bigger outbreak bigger population people may hard reach. 

Assume even people who've sick already thinking ""I'll wait vaccine, I've sick already"" seems pretty likely might already enough people immune stave sort serious spike. 

Not nearly herd immunity, course, enough keep people dying, maybe significant numbers.  kidding. month ago ate 3 soft pretzels, next day gained 4 lbs. Luckily water weight (presumably salt) gone following morning.   send jnj vaccine doctors offices well. like 250k GPs US. Brazil use national debt like US, EU countries. 
Congress approved R$20 billion buy vaccines, AFAIK used 10% so. Yea don’t even 1 million yet, far know. It’s immoral get vaccine already could allow someone else could die get it. NC teachers offered vaccinations school openings (Group 3a). see that? seem like pace 100M+ either those. 1 3?

So you’re saying 130,000,000 Americans COVID? 500,000 died? What’s survival rate that... 99.6%? I’m infectious disease expert I’ve since beginning. Trust tell IQ sub dropped like rock past several months. Reddit

Which mean doesnt make sense adult world claim HPV vaccine debunked, information. journal published paper claim retracted bad statistical methods. also, make sure, researchers look hard good statistical methods verify link yes, link. difference time hospital staff protected flu. 

And look what's happening variants. new dominant variants starting take replace original strain, (UK, South African, Brazilian, etc.) contagious, severe, lethal, resistant current vaccinations. would trend continue next variant? 2nd shot makes last longer would be? Brazil? announced they'll importing 10 million doses Sputnik V producing well. state, pretty politically neutral one, indoor outdoor dining closed months.

Convenient appointments limited. people car enough savvy post reddit, plenty. guys keep backpedaling. States open spikes death. don't, masking up? seen spring break photos? know right. Bunch dumbass politicians putting people's lives line. 53,250 doses higher last Tuesday (1,655,996 - 1,602,746). 

However, keep mind based date reported, date administered. doses actually administered past 2 weeks. takes days data make way CDC, we've got lagging view things reported. likely, 3M+ days since last week. know sure data comes in. see date administration here: Sister's diagnosis pneumonia too. I'm thinking lucky doctor diagnose COVID-19 go damn ventilator like New York did.  lost muscle mass couple months. Hospitalization metric though, % vaccinated Anyone numbers vaccines EU getting? numbers? hear GE maybe going back lockdown? aren’t getting shots arms ? Pfizer best real world numbers, far know. 

NOT getting covid important “severity hospitalization” (which typical way people try draw direct comparisons less effective vaccines like JJ AZ). would hard prove negative. ""No evidence"" analysis likely able 

It's amazing many people understand this. lot redditors seriously lack even basic science education. Yes uncle antibodies May assumed Harry had. got sick time- Harry right Mike. Mike took hospital sick none us wanted get it. wasn’t sick since all. flew day Kobe died.  Point is. literally Zero reason EU less 40 million doses behind US. going dozens people happy this!   vaccine-infertility claim debunked people found serious flaws original paper said so.  Thanks! Great news. cool discussion, weird constantly mentioned clear defence individual member states decisions halt roll-out. two separate issues.

Also, merging two opinions assuming everyone holds both. Personally, I'm critical individual member states unscientific decision halt roll-out, strongly serves undermine public confidence vaccine no-doubt result COVID deaths. I'm also critical AZs inability deliver vaccines adequate quantity EU.

And no-one saying 'EU leadership jail' around issue, perhaps EMA called countries stop roll-out. say based current evidence, benefits vaccine significantly outweigh negatives. yay..... Fantastic!

I'm answering question.

I beg differ. RotaSheild live virus vaccine carried smaller, similar risks actual infection. taken market far better vaccines (non-live virus) became available. 

Another Wyeth vaccine, Dryvax, faced similar fate. saved millions lives, side effects alternatives came later. 

You make sound like huge decades long coverup, what's going steady progression increasing pharmaceutical safety.

To knowledge, Dengvaxia case know regarding bad vaccine (not effective safe). Opening everyone doesn’t make go faster there’s still plenty demand priority groups. cidrap says 'may' 'likely'

the cdc post literally says increased risk blood clots increased risk MISC-C children, no, less risk. looks like FDA recently eased storage restrictions vaccines letting stored pharmaceutical grade freezers 2 weeks.

So looks supply chain efficiency/availability issue storage issue now. 

That said, I've two mass vaccination sites efficiency throughput impressive. obviously economy scale this. know, states! Whole states! Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally

That's quote posts says...

My source includes relevant quotes CEO BioNTech Kathrin Jansen, head vaccine research development Pfizer. Sounds pretty credible me. Lifting mask mandate equal banning masks dude

Tell business owners Texas getting attacked vandalized still requiring masks. suggestion take 5 months reach herd immunity *clearly* disagreeing someone saying ""we nearly thing"". Closer 5 weeks, 5 months. colonists brought diseases killed natives. natives bring vaccines save descendants colonists. strive humane morally upright tribal leaders. states? Texas trending down. also google? Yup. think Buddhist precept: ""The truth lies between."" wanted flex switched blood printer ink. 

Only downside occasionally shouting CYAN LOW sex Plus make sense, considering entering country seek asylum example port entry amount illegal jaywalking, somewhere along lines small fine.

If would actually sought asylum, illegal. Also kinda weird parents make decisions might future side effects kids. They're ahead expected 9 even 6 months ago. Everyone keeps moving goal posts complaining country behind. limitation due lack supply? Nice straw man. didn’t say United States Europe China. said failed deal virus responsibly. United States already doesn’t respect human rights. It’s incarcerated nation earth. even hate intentionally want demean people,

Uh, what? guess politically correct word undocumented? They're still illegal immigrants, living country without permission, illegal. That's literally correct word them, demean way insult. many even pay taxes weird sanctuary cities? Ohio residents? someone state come get too? mine broad test would detect covid-19 similar virus antibodies. first one positive got specific test highly accurate (to point distinguishes natural infection antibodies result vaccine). Vitalant, secondary test this:
 specificity 100% sensitivity (whatever means)

Keep mind blood centers vested interest getting good results want plasma antibodies (or least policies made). Strictly speaking, covid vaccines still experimental stage, approved emergency use. Therefore legitimate thing review cases, ensure everything still ok.

And EU nothing postponing vaccine rollout, sovereign decision member state. 

And second bigger supplier undermine whole vaccination program, hope rectify issues soon. I'm guessing ~May 1, everyone wants vaccine either gotten least 1 jab scheduled appointment. Soooo close so? Expediency. tried decades wipe israel map failed. Happy you. Thanks contributing effort. start see sort stakes companies playing for. Yearly streams billions billions dollars. wonder seems excessive scrutiny scaremongering one vaccine that's sold profit. There's people getting insanely rich back undermining it. 80+ year olds travel youngsters stay home continue go work, eat restaurant anything fun. Sounds like solid plan. helps hydrated go in. Like pee every 20 minutes there. Makes veins nice plump easy hit.

I donate lot. Hydration makes difference. also reduces ""needle time"". fill bag 6-10 minutes. received German funding open factory Germany came online February 2021 represents small portion vaccines produced. 

Pfizer carried continue carry EU. That’s different conversation entirely. I’m nationalizing/heavily regulating healthcare supply chain general. requires significant system changes aren’t gonna happen anytime soon total assumption assumption here, 29.5MM confirmed COVID cases US (per Johns Hopkins), means 9% US population confirmed COVID case. assume people donating blood tested positive COVID (which think reasonable), says another 20% COVID. would imply 30% US population COVID, line CDC estimates. ""citizens"" trust Israel Israelis. Anecdotally, removal mask mandate Texas changed thing. People wearing masks (and that's almost everyone cities), still wearing them. establishments schools still requiring them. people familiar Bucee's, last place expect find people masked. However, every single person saw today wearing one. Bill Schaffner estimates 80% population yet infected. may overestimate, simply know percentage people overcome infection cellular immunity never develop significant antibody levels. Uh, states??? theoretically could treatment people exposure COVID long within day exposure? Nothing see here. Completely normal action China. states? haven’t seen anybody reporting new surges anywhere US shows data heterosexual men says nothing MSM. Showing heterosexual men low-risk showing MSM high risk. gay panic nonsense 80's absolutely nothing help AIDS pandemic. CDC released guidance last week saying vaccinated people hang unvaccinated people safely without masks comparison antivaxxers laughable.

What think [top voted AZ thread suggesting big pharma conspiracy AZ ? conspiracy BS anti vaxx serve us ? make uneducated guess: EMA conclude there's clear relation. Germany include ""rare cases thrombosis"" ""contact medical professional experience lingering headaches 4 days vaccination"" leaflet get handed vaccination. Venn diagram people post /r/antiwork consider leftists perfect circle. say financed development vaccine, said company developed vaccine received German EU funding. 

But article extra vaccines funding BioNTech received increased production capacity, comment responded claimed Pfizer somehow ""carries"" EU. think EU actively funded increasing production capacity inaccurate. started 65+ Alberta. going long wait. Meanwhile active cases city highest since March 2020.  Fortunately gave birth pandemic (or aware happening states). would never allowed baby sight taken away me...the height dehumanizing behavior. book Kroger appointments til 26th right I'm mistaken data spread COVID non-vaccinated fully-vaccinated people? I've fully vaccinated (as understand it, two weeks second dose Moderna), go visit friends regardless vaccination status? Like said proved credible source, Pfizer paid 100% development costs vaccine. 

Thanks playing. Haha good point, meant charge people directly rather allocating tax money towards it. yea definitely seems fair, think said another comment start obviously price gouging, discussed post, regulate fuck put cap price. think “tell em get packing” person responded said seems heavy handed could come back bite us future meanwhile, states already opened back already reporting surges numbers... /sighs

If nothing else, think proven just-how-much people eager mall over, along impatience so. rural areas it’s harder find vaccine populous areas it’s not. big cities (cleveland, columbus, dayton, etc) seem mass vaccination sites, even they’re trouble filling appointments i’m assuming we’re expanding availability. live dayton i’ve registered multiple family members vaccine problems finding one, course you’re always going stories people small towns able get one 85 year old grandparents. vaccine shipments going increase future though, shouldn’t really problem. last check 1/5 ohioans already gotten first shot anyways, think it’s good system around. watched interview Canadian news CEO co-founder SaNOtize, hoping could weeks approval. months come  imply ""no mask = certified sociopath"".

it actually imply that. mean imply that, would say ""risk taking impulsive"" since that's precise way describe findings. there's reason bring word ""sociopathic"" it, except mislead. Covid daily statistics like box chocolates. Never know whatcha gonna get. Certain European countries playing politics get people killed.  like like head head numbers know two UK. others? assuming older people care something themselves. dissuade illusion, everything makes sense. doctor put obese file post pneumonia weigh-in back feb decided didn’t want fat anymore. Plus reading Covid comorbidity factors. someone 40+ category Ohio, schedule vaccine appointment Friday wait Friday book? Yeah, imma send /u/positivityrate get antivax BS worked out. would suggest Big pharma definetly hand tbh. Whether Sputnik, Pfizer etc. Everyone wants make bank global emergency makes sense bit job one vaccine selling cost. tried. Hmm told get vaccinated even though finished last round chemo December 9th. got first shot February 22nd. hope good immune response... FAQs seem sensible, *7 1.6 million* seems OTT... [Looking seems like 15% completely opposed taking vaccine 5-15% fence. think get 60% pretty easily next 25% hard convince point decent chunk get vaccinated.

That said, I'm you. think going ""percent vaccinated"" best policy. Hopefully we're focused number deaths state hospitals. things warm death rate drops people going return normal without government's permission, like many people started ""locking down"" government told to.  


I think best officials proactive take steps like saying, setting realistic benchmarks people work towards line people actually behave. officials focus much maximizing safety they'll end completely losing ear people end result worst worlds. don’t narc experience CVS. work healthcare (biotech manufacturing) online form asked employer's name. check ID told bring got there. can’t believe people downvoting Michigan currently surging like it’s fault it’s happening. sub weird. huge true Source it’s way higher? word would use cases doubling Michgan?  already posted Flooding one get appt stopping people trying. done least rest month. got coworkers DRIVING work refreshing appts. That's bad here. even try? starting get common around here. people would vaccinated even gave two weeks groups. pause. lag. shitshow getting appts since January. 

You prioritizing upper class people already home instead people working community, actively spreading virus, keeping numbers high make situation end. that's really point. Keep desireables protected expense menial members society. ending this, would prioritizing people drive case numbers. MRNA vaccines potentially thicken blood like Covid? may going unreported? trials would participants come blood labs regularly? (Guessing yes.) sorry, able work home.

I loved working home. employer let go July. Yeah, Sweden. AZ doses never “sitting shelves” here. approved 65+, used health care workers, soon approved older people started administering people priority group 1 2. CDC new state allocations week 9.24M (up 9.07M 6.66M (flat 6.66M week)

[Johnson &amp; 390k (down 494k week) mean - I’m San Diego we’re overweight obese. covers like 74% Americans. illness would impacted COVID. 

And there’s validations. It’s honor system. don’t ask questions. Needing proof vaccine travel abroad would fun see meltdown people posted already. look back last year United States, much would say we're danger cautious?

Yes, theoretically possible careful. covid like common cold, would inappropriate shut anything (although would still like become normal Western countries wear mask sick). points clear dividing line: people's lives. people still dying significant numbers, restrictions necessary. they're not, lift restrictions.

And yes, think around May June. Opening go stages, still early go stages.  think demand slows get around 50% adults - mid April. rest year working getting arms people lazy, unsure want it, popup vaccination sites zip codes low rates, etc. Peaking around 70-75% end year. justification states still restricting eligibility quickly disappear couple days like this.

People sub like think states reason *against* getting fast possible. like seeing much do; thought could open 8 weeks ""done"" mass vaccination efforts rest clean up, they'd it. 

You're right though, days amount distributed they'll figure there's point restricting way. Assuming ability physically administer shots equivalent speed. mention Europe severely undermining AZ vaccine *yet again*, already issues public accepting it. Even vaccinations resumed, cost even deaths many people refuse take vaccine this. think moderna already phase 2 trials personalized mRNA cancer tumor killing vaccines. Really depends group tbh. Der Spiegel also one newspapers read every day. impression. case, prominently placed. simply don’t believe thing would possible. government doesn’t authority done China. don’t believe Americans would allowed government seize power it. shooting war likely America bolting people homes, destroying infrastructure keep rural areas isolated, pulling citizens homes throwing camps. alone, affected long time That's definitely gonna happen. surprised, given health experts much control society Indiana virtually restrictions mask mandates. RemindMe! 73 days

I hope you’re right! woke drenched sweat couple days shot felt little fatigued. much better noon.  Sorry normal medical doctors vaccine scientists. may good job treating patients, they're simply qualified making calls national/global vaccine programs. opinion worth basically nothing compared someone studies works vaccines. simply field. someone works biology-related field, mean they're interchangeable. likely even access relevant vaccine data, yet we're somehow supposed take opinion fact stop entire continent's vaccine program based it? uh vaccines? Plummeting hospitalizations? States like Florida, Iowa, Montana turning apocalyptic wastelands? Technically get results, parents delay vaccine appointment. say get exposed last 14 days. I'm doctor believe reason say would exposing everyone vaccination site would unfortunate positive. positive covid chance, body would natural antibodies recover believe say get vaccine within 90 days testing positive Yep suspect that's true. also reduces crazy crush appointment seekers get open general population. got first dose! people think vaccine demand? me, feel little pessimistic it. feel like we’re gonna get 60-70% want we’ll reach number summer. don’t like idea politicians businesses schools like “oh enough people vaccinated yet! get [possibly unrealistic quota] we’ll start open up!”. Like shouldn’t go percentage vaccinated, go hospital capacity, hospitalization death counts, honestly could use hard deadlines too. thing we’re already really well regards. I’m worried doubling stuff could happen coming months. hell going Alabama? 1,000 cases daily throughout almost entire month suddenly 4,000+ cases today. Smart parents do. That’s get flu shot  That's super relevant. Yes, JnJ Astrazeneca slightly higher exposure variants exposure prevalence differential pretty trivial except JnJ/AZ South Africa specifically. 

JnJ batting behind single dose vaccine (although admittedly MRNA vaccines really, really fucking good - appears ~90% effectiveness two weeks single dose, although may last long second dose booster important, although pretty clear delaying bit fine). 

I may wrong (I paid attention AZ since approved US), thought issue AZ tested infection (weekly tests) symptoms. That's going bias effectiveness significantly. again, AZ issue using unstabilized spike protein seems like ultimately wrong design decision light new variants even antibody titers similar testing original strain. Better alternative. super problematic still. I'm sure that. 
They either cause damage confidence AZ now. 
 
Or contamination ignored it, create whole lot antivaxxers. even safe, notion ignored potential health risk going hurt faith AZ also regulators. 
 
Neither great, think still better suspend. 
 
Personally think still safe offered shot AZ tomorrow, would take it. positivity rate 2%. county positivity rates low since last June. Oh California 2% positivity rate conducting highest levels testing country. blood sometimes entirely missing Von Willebrand's Factor (needed clotting), often low Factor VIII (also needed clotting), jampacked autoantibodies (damaging) including severely high rheumatoid factor (damaging) natural killer t-cells roof (angry immune system). blood danger others (if allowed donate). lol :( also one household. good point centralized registration system hiding data 3rd party site. I'm guessing systems already efficient distribution though, state knows exactly many people want vaccine area. Mid April going see stories everywhere. Good problem though.  California though? Yeah conundrum.

Marginalised groups tend yo respond poorly incentives work general populations. issue inmy country vaccinations indigenous people.

No easy answers. Hmmm guess I’m sure. know Wisconsin “held onto” 20,000 doses one week instead administering federal government punished severely dropping allotment next week. told sped back stopped holding onto second doses using first doses instead allotments would increase again.   expect 1 get 7, thats 7:1 ratio. original trial 4. Also Ohioan. Happy happened.

We're done vaccinating vulnerable groups teachers. move makes sure demand long supply avaliable. Get many people vaccinated quickly possible. looks like Russians benefit Americans. Canada right you. make u feel better like 60k shots population 40 mln Ukraine. 80% medics straight refuse take shitty Indian AZ vaccine have. Walgreens open till like 9pm. 24 hours. Maybe 1 mass vax sites. people want get regular errands. schlep dodger stadium BioNTech scientists developed vaccine, though, deserve applause effectiveness Pfizer. There's gotta breaking point Biden understands administration can't catch s-curve production, amount distributed always far outstrip administration. Therefore, would wise send extra doses produced beyond administration capacity nations Moderna, Pfizer AstraZeneca contracts fulfill. people think conspiracy amount people blood clots lower normally would be.

There's money yearly booster shots ""lessen severe symptoms"" actually preventing infection. condone violating sane pro-hygienic measures like refusing wearing masks ""just because"". violating standard procedure implementation measures within constitutional and/or law limits level. 

All situation mentioned (courts dismissing measures, ordinary people completely lost dozens anti-epidemic systems \[red/yellow/green zones? much space allowed week shop? national lockdown regional? take week child stay home week, not? fined must repair necessary car, thus leaving home?\] eternal dumbness politicians. Despite necessary tools table, like calling emergency state, decided impose new, ever-changing restrictions press conferences zero value law order, government's ordinance faulty line acts (faulty definition without emergency state). would harder (i.e. would compensations necessary) least would kind order.

But believe this, everywhere find memes one-year jubilee two-weeks lockdown, many restrictions, many changes sure anyone knows compulsory not. ideal example would new year's eve. opposite political parties way better; instead pushing order sanity, prefer argue abortion legal not.

The result like see - complete mess.

I support ignoring basic rules avoidance pandemic spread, understand people complete mess. 

Law order seems dull matter. However, needs preserved. One day health minister's spokesperson (having right announce new rules, way) issues closure public schools ""legal basis"" conference press. OK. making law basing ""what Prime Minister came up"" conclude much dramatic consequences. Law general order, also - limit people's greed demolition society. matter demolition done politician decides ruin lifes barmans moron walks around covid symptoms ""because believe virus"".  No. It’s literally fine, variants been. Don’t give attention it’ll stop mentioned within week. deliver 200k best. It’s AZ. countries preparing another lockdown whilst UK getting ready normality. vaccines safe done purely political Yeah plasma one sucks... take much something  is. Unfortunately, hundreds different kinds cancer one-size-fits-all treatment really works; like, point identical twins type cancer might get results treatment: there's hope; according CDC, cancer deaths US 27% 1999-2019 period: since cancers seem caused triggered viruses, improvements vaccine development &amp; effectiveness hopefully lead reductions cancer cases future.

Finally: good news I've heard reported times recently global pandemic actually (and seemingly permanently) altered way global medical research community works. Previously, immediate international cooperation data sharing would unheard of—but required situation benefits already improving research fields. Hopefully leads faster effective developments treatments diseases, cancer included, going forward. Wanting spread disease amongst active duty troops... Uh probably reported relieved duty. Actively making unit unfit duty reason court martial. May due higher dosage moderna guess *begin* testing, *plans* begin testing. already knew. news. Still remains seen highly effective actually roughly 3 millions.

3 *that clustered community*. millions vaccinations gone well irrelevant cluster like that. Thank making obvious isn’t serious conversation admittedly know nothing vaccine QC processes I'll take said face value. 

What know REGULARLY get notifications pharmacy medicine I've purchased batches recalled. way hope determine events random not.

They already determined random unrelated shots. problem is, public always mistake ""abundance caution"" coverup something nefarious. public absolutely sucks this. ughh first watch DS9 pandemic amazed quality, thought give Voyager shot. Man.... rough show watch. couple fun episodes like ten really bizarre rough ones... hope gets better season 3... saying head physician treating patients?

Better get suspended get bottom then... Yeah, it’s big issue EU free US? I'd wondering Walgreens charging. company helped develop produce highly effective vaccine less 12 months... good friend doctor Boston shocked it. Especially amount folks vaccinated UK without issues small numbers issues mainland Europe. feels they're want AZ shot, reason hold Moderna Pfizer shots. (he's American way) he's also scared massive uptick going Europe cost lot lives.  

I'm wondering countries like Czechia Poland would take AZ rest Europe's hands get issues control? almost like EU going crumble many countries going procure supply sputnik sinovax fear. patients Norway reported blood clots.

No, health agencies reported serious rare combination multiple blood clots, low levels platelets bleeding. UK doctor would know ""my country's decision"". absolute shame, really can't believe this. Funny thing happened tried track high school. Quelle surprise. one time I'll say California needs follow Mississippi's lead matter, can't deliver anyway. EU cancel AZ contracts. There's point more. can't deliver people want them. focus elsewhere? feel like one picture Squidward looking dark house SpongeBob Patrick play outside. called 'power red' think actually much better experience lot fluid gets returned body:  Alberta vaccinated 368k 4.4ish million population. That’s pretty sad. Meanwhile city active cases since March 2020 despite low vaccinations everyone acting like everyone vaccinated.

We opened anyone 65+. BC actually even behind though, recently opening 90+ care homes etc moving 80+ soon.

We need vaccines. Man, it’s hot one Well, that's exactly say. still 8pm curfew lol. Initial high-ish levels skepticism, largely around vaccines untested. vaccines tested, skepticism declined, much faster rate people getting vaccinated. would likely provide passive adaptive immunity, depending many antibodies had. However, tools needed make like vaccine would short lived. healthy, likly short term protection (based solely immunity works generally, covid specific). Two companies based one country extorting world. Bond villainy. yeah knew phizer moderna mrna.  

The wording J&amp;J Astra caused concern. called live direction drug like dupixent suggests get live vaccine.

The details understanding non replicating new understanding. something look Fair point. hate makes feel better best, highlights crippling bureaucracy EU / regulators

The EMA favour AZ. national medical authorities convincing national politicians suspend rollout. according brexiteers like you, anything negative happens UK fault ""the worst malign misinformation discredit UK / divert attention away parlous vax rollout Continent.

If AZ vaccine ""the UK"" ""the UK"" whole reason vaccine rollout going poorly, delivering tiny fraction contract.

AZ acting bad faith. real world civil courts, letter contract less important spirit it. appears AZ caught EU technicality, went ""lol got you"" proceeded deliver 5% ordered, 1 4 factories contract.

And AZ ""the UK"" claim, means ""the UK"" directly responsible sabotaging EU's vaccine effort. would act war. better hope AZ actually ""the UK"", hm? Skepticism Black Americans dropping pretty rapidly availability opens up. Basically seems like people skeptical they're eligible, even less skeptical friends get shots.

Also, May pretty far full eligibility. We'll hitting 50% adults early April. politics works. Italy, that's case, fact case ""our gov't pressured us follow others, even though disagree"". still doubt that's true countries started/followed it...

It definitly wrong Germany. Actually, health minister asked morning would continue AZ said would hours later indepent scientific institute advises government vaccines came say think halt, minister go back word hours later halt process. wonderful chocolate chip cookies! seriously, donate could save lives. speculating may saved 4-8 lives hard believe really. You’re going overpluck eyebrows listen Smooth repeat? Oh dear. lot people adjust prejudices.

Some 20% U.K. adults given vaccine. clearly safe. Shameless Europes leaders, could cost lives, coming remaining voting UK person vaccinate three people every Wednesday. Indeed. almost certain least one vaccine dozens developed would safe effective, would get good results Q2 2021 surprisingly good outcome. We

Many countries nationalized internal healthcare systems, helps point. Drug development needs handled globally ideally. can't put things hold ever. Plus, giving birth now, 9 months ago forgiven believing shit would Right that's I'm saying. Like... I'd HOPE limit spread variant staying hell home feel sick. Unfortunately memory goldfish year 2, people back sniffling offices. (I mean, summer states) we'll vax'd up. everyone gets transfusions due injury though realistically, people ""essential worker roles"" can't that. Grocery workers can't. Postal workers can't. Daycare workers can't. Amazon workers can't. types people working directly people heighten spread. 

Johnny McJohnny working home getting appointment ending sooner. guess priority. making sure upper eschelons society safe. numbering system bring bugs? I'm sure end ok shareholders Pfizer people made bank smearing lower cost competition. think it’s normal scared that. It’s valid reason want again. anti-GMO stances Europe proof anti-science opinions take hold anywhere. Let guess. deadly. hell variants less deadly? political decision countries suspended. Norway decision institute public health, links government politicians. Last time went (a couple months ago) Nutter Butters. Oh yes, Jan. 6 remember sitting eating Nutter Butters, watching Capitol Insurrection phone. time colleges back fall vaccines available anyone wants months. guess late summer (conservatively) able walk CVS get without appointment supply outpaced demand then.  detail seem appear article (or missed it?) source unique quality clots? actually extremely cool news.

The way variants currently detected? First get positive test, send sequencing. 

This skips second costly, timely step. pre-programmed aspects virus look including spike protein mutations, machine ALSO tell variant detected.

Getting machines medical centers labs around world would help variant spread fight like believe!

If nothing else, machine area start returning bunch positive hits, ???? strain covid tests back?

You know new, significantly mutated strain region! None institutions associated EU except EMA, pro AZ.

Also, blame goes AZ criminally underdelivered acting bad faith it. That's.... medicine works No, probably not. Apparently, one detected PCR tests. Oh well. deaths reported events vaccination UK. 

This says absolutely nothing specific. sorry unclear initial statement, meant purely sarcastic. smelled correctly, line thinking leads perpetual lockdowns end sight. 

I completely understand points, especially Soviet-style gulag (feeling similar myself), lack perspective future us. We, least Europe, thrown omni-potent dystopian state, sort biofascist authority everything subjected one single issue. infinitely saddens see much degraded since 2020 managed throw away lives, future, mental health, rights freedoms never-ending War Covid. 

Once go road seriously considering lockdowns, despite proven ineffectivity massive damage caused fabric society, simply never end, always risk somewhere prompt new lockdowns, police state usher bizarre new world. bit third jabs, bro give fucking break. bleak. happens, it’s going end well. decision came shortly AZ announced would deliver barely anything Q2 well.

It easier abundantly cautious nothing stake get 5% order anyway. I'm really angry leaders nations suspended vaccine.

The previous admin pretended even real six months went golfing instead handling pandemic. worry much. Viruses mutate. That's do. Flu every day year year vaccine it. Thankfully, covid mutates lot slower flu vaccines developed year ago still preventing almost 100% hospitalization death. suggest her, ask aware starting Wednesday weekend incase needs go hospital fast. kneejerk reactions European countries without evidence suspicious. agencies considering repercussions later seen failed take action prevent harm public. Basically harm *them* pausing (say) 2 weeks less harm nothing problem proven later, regardless pause caused extra deaths. ""Abundance caution"". Let’s review interest AZ vaccine failing:

- Pharma companies producing profit vaccine - cost $billions.

- EU governments - really don’t like U.K.’s vaccination success need distractions.

- Russia China - using vaccines diplomatic gain.

Now wonder almost negative vaccine stories involve AZ? Paywall, I'm gonna say no, worried. 

I AZ yesterday worried one bit. Could France PCR negative variant hitting news? 

Are going say “test” Covid negative turns variant dodged PCR test? sure much updated months ago, multiple studies came indicating people mild infections developing antibodies (or low antibody count.) proceeding hypothesis innate immune system fought off, change health picture would stand reason would able fight again. knows?

Better way? mean like trust results American Red Cross believe they're bang job actually searching antibodies. IDK Millions people dozens countries received AstraZeneca Covid vaccine reports ill effects, prior testing tens thousands people found safe.

But recently, blood clots abnormal bleeding small number vaccine recipients European countries cast doubt safety, although causative link found patients’ conditions vaccine. reports prompted dozen countries either partly fully suspend vaccine’s use cases investigated. nations said precaution leading health agencies could review cases.

The AstraZeneca vaccine authorized use yet United States, although review U.S. trial expected soon.

What types problems caused countries take precautionary steps?

The cascade decisions pause use AstraZeneca’s vaccine, mainly European countries, followed reports four serious cases Norway, described among health workers age 50 received vaccine. developed clots bleeding abnormalities low platelet counts, health authorities said. Two died brain hemorrhages, two hospitalized. death 60-year-old woman Denmark 57-year-old man Italy also fueled quick decisions, although none deaths fully investigated determine whether link shots received.
What blood clot causes generally?

A blood clot thickened, gelatinous blob blood block circulation. Clots form response injuries also caused many illnesses, including cancer genetic disorders, certain drugs prolonged sitting bed rest. Clots form legs sometimes break travel lungs brain, deadly.

Can vaccine cause blood clots?

Vaccines shown cause blood clots, said Daniel Salmon, director Institute Vaccine Safety Johns Hopkins University.

Blood clots common general population, health authorities suspect cases reported vaccine recipients likely coincidental related vaccination.

“There lot causes blood clotting, lot predisposing factors, lot people increased risk — often also people vaccinated right now,” said Mark Slifka, vaccine researcher Oregon Health Science University.

From 300,000 600,000 people year United States develop blood clots lungs veins legs parts body, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Thats still factor 100 away million. kind side effect happens million? Exactly, that's makes likely political. EU action would need wider consensus higher likelihood blocked somewhere along line, whereas individual member states need consensus take action quickly possible. ""Why Europe done poorly? three main reasons.

Too much bureaucracy

While U.S. countries rushed sign agreements vaccine makers, E.U. first tried make sure 27 member countries agreed approach negotiations. Europe chose “to prioritize process speed put solidarity E.U. countries ahead giving individual governments room maneuver,” Jillian Deutsch Sarah Wheaton write Politico Europe.

The result slower regulatory approval vaccines delayed agreements buy doses, forcing Europe wait line behind countries moved faster.

Penny-wise pound-foolish

Europe put big emphasis negotiating low price vaccine doses. Israeli officials, contrast, willing pay premium receive doses quickly. Israel paid around $25 per Pfizer dose, U.S. pays $20 per dose. E.U. pays $15 $19.

The discounted price became another reason Europe wait line behind countries. Even purely economic terms, trade-off probably bad one: $1 saved per vaccine dose might ultimately add $1 billion — rounding error trading bloc nearly $20 trillion annual economic output. single additional lockdown, like one Italy announced week, could wipe savings.

“The price difference macroeconomically irrelevant,” Münchau writes. E.U. “tried lock perceived short-term price advantage expense everything else.”

Vaccine skepticism

“Europe world’s epicenter vaccine skepticism,” Deutsch Wheaton Politico Europe write. skepticism predated Covid, consequences becoming clear.

In survey published journal Nature Medicine, residents 19 countries asked would take Covid vaccine “proven safe effective.” China, 89 percent people said yes. U.S., 75 percent did. shares lower across Europe: 68 percent Germany, 65 percent Sweden, 59 percent France 56 percent Poland.

The skepticism helps explain Europe’s latest vaccination problem. dozen countries, including France Germany, suspended use one continent’s primary vaccines, AstraZeneca, citing concerns blood clots."" We're looking 45 weeks current rates Sweden... would done June Astrazeneca fucking scummy. others actually send promised time might done August. Slight correction: donated units positive pool (batch) thrown out, test samples pool individually retested positive sample pool identified. confirmatory (individual) testing slow, imperfect, expensive comparison pooled testing. measures VOCs, Formaldehyde, PM less 1 micron, PM less 2.5 microns, PM less 10 microns. 

given determined virus stay airborne hours unreasonable believe going travel 3 feet. donated ***one time*** Texas 7 years ago. lived Illinois time (visiting TX) still live Illinois. 

They still call asking donate blood Texas. haggling price meant changes production reduce cost goods. Non profit either way. clear say hardcore remainer. 

This whole saga stupid EU tbh. would want skimp production costs urgently needed vaccine you’re collection richest countries world? said death rates, mortality risk. counting population, cases.

Brazil, 11,483,370 cases, 278,327 deaths, 2.42% ratio.

Germany, 2,569,850 cases, 73,907 deaths, 2.88% ratio.

With “permanent organ damage” shown much rarer originally thought vaccines anecdotally improving conditions, long Covid seems psychosomatic lot people. one country mentioned mean suddenly allowed talk countries anymore. Especially whole article/thread collective countries. exclusively Norway. I'm surprised seem unfamiliar conversations develop. No, no, better experience. cold (due loss blood, lower temp plasma return you) (170lb M) passed every time I've tried. never passed out, even felt remotely woozy regular donation. 

Source: O- blood, always want power red (and tried multiple times!) donated like 22 times total now, decent experience matter sure, used words. really afterthought, really arguing for. would transfer antibodies recipient. However, main perk vaccinated cellular immunity, consists cells remember pathogen looks like long time body stops producing antibodies. transfer blood donation.

So recipient get antibodies (not many grand scheme things), would give temporary protection best. could help someone active covid-19 infection, jury still that. Experimental treatments using blood plasma people recovered disease studied (so-called ""convalescent plasma therapy""), results mind blowing. I’m anti vax, spare lecture.

I think enrolling clinical trials definition different taking fully approved vaccine. children fully vaccinated following pediatrician’s guidance. would still enroll clinical trial. think statisticians ponder exactly questions right now? one knows sure what's going one, really one, *wanted* stop vaccination. Good time invest stocks $PFE $BNTX.

Also, uncommon potentially life-threatening side effect heparin therapy called HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia). Risk HIT low (0.1%) subQ heparin prophylaxis start giving large populations heparin, start seeing people showing HIT coagulation issues makes perfect sense symptoms long covid actually result anxiety. 

This doesn’t include symptoms loss smell, course, story coming long-covid clinics across world now, almost always mean symptoms like brain fog tiredness. STFU lying t\_d user.

Here's AZ breaching said contract (that sure read, like read transcripts probably told others read) factories EU used produce EU deliver promised doses.

Why AZ trying export vaccines produced Italy Australia clear breach contract ? Yeah, treated heparin warfarin fucking terrible around. I'm scared another clot caused COVID COVID itself. said heparin completely safe. said wasn't. 

RPh patients die heparin induced thrombocytopenia. Argatroban exactly cheap either. 

Also grandmother died retroperitoneal bleed heparin different state years ago.

You different ideas completely safe means. fade SARS MERS years. actually mean lost sterilizing immunity, problem. 

I think rule (it proposed one hypothesis happened Manaus), also think there's recent research supports it. dense? stuff uses UK *not vaccine*. comes different factories. people get sick Coca Cola Paris, point Denver say ""Look, drink there, must safe!"". 

 Experts reported *serious side effects*. DATA. chart, notice first time ever, flu deaths, heart disease, cancer Dropped exact time?

What odds that?

The average age COVID death US Least 74. don’t exact numbers cdc lists deaths range interpolate data skew towards higher lower age ranges. 

Suffice say unquestioned number 80% deaths people 60 years old more. 

Now. Knowing life expectancy 2019 78, it’s quite simple see someone 70 heart attack, likely blamed Covid. 

Whether Covid Anything make matter worse certainly valid argument, blame Covid solely cause death people 85 literally happening give government power life. 

Wake up. True Reddit moment. I’m sure know it’s vaccine. not, even cursory bit research would revealed you... Jesus Christ, sub breeze anything European. bet still stands.

I've people ask Chinese wife Asia China. replied.. ""a good chunk is!""

I shit not! mention blood clots article. issue symptom isolation. issue specific combination symptoms. I'm saying good decision, I'm saying that's probably logic.

Politicians often make decisions risk averse position. wonder stage, near future actually want see cases younger people mitigated risk vulnerable dying.. Could one make case building immunity among least vulnerable protect entire population long run potential variants virus? I'm allowed donate anymore I'm negative blood apparently mutant rage beast hell according Red Cross.

Hold sec. Say now? blood mutant rage beast hell?? cop answer going ""Here look 4 cases ignore literal millions data points make decision"".  give kids chicken pox vaccine though. shingles vaccine comes much later everyone.

If vaccinate kids Covid probably reach herd immunity.

At risk adults kids can't get vaccines legitimate health reasons rely healthy kids vaccinated keep safe. 

There's reason vaccinate children long vaccines pass safety tests, seems pretty likely. found super rare blood clot issue cases single hospital

This incorrect. ""single hospital"" refer takes patients across country need specialised treatment local hospitals provide. People gets transferred hospital hospitals. website? vaccinate children chickenpox, also protects shingles. rates population gets prioritised vaccine general population though? 

The 1.6m people got vaccinated going representative population sample begin with, due prioritising elderly vulnerable, no?

There may much smaller differential 50 so, could explained clumpy nature random events deliveries q4... political decision countries suspended. Norway decision institute public health, links government politicians.

“Pods” poor working class parents, paid state, didn’t send kids school? San Francisco know that’s possible. that’s unacceptable costs money. Right?

So instead engage magical thinking pretend care deeply ""the children"" - children get parental care low income parents work three jobs survive, children get enough eat, children whose education school substandard many graduate without able read. children. That's much care them. Warfarin? hated go hospital every week could take blood tell weeks dosage. bad would also need take heparin injection. never fun.

It's even vaccine whole. number issues could cause this, Norwegian health authorities leaving stone left unturned. really understanding ? governments coordinated mean decisions based science. Merkel randomly suspend usage AZ vaccine. recommended health authority overseeing vaccines. actually give children shingles vaccine, called chicken pox vaccine them. kids, scientists  chronic negligency make worse. real world consequences failure free market great allow happen sake practicing economic theory. pharmaceutical industry exempt liability. Since Biden’s likely pass Winter stimulus bill time Trump, think Murphy Cuomo might follow Newsom’s lead year lockdown tri-state area three months. Either way, see way public reacts. actually tried link article earlier sub's bot Germany's health minister, Jens Spahn, said Monday pausing AstraZeneca rollout precautionary measure following advice Germany's vaccine regulator, Paul Ehrlich Institute. institute advised halt seven cases blood clotting reported following administration 1.6 million doses number incidents Germany across Europe small authorities trying establish whether related vaccine, Mr. Spahn said. Germany looking EMA advice, blood clots reported people received AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine known generally venous thromboembolic events, relatively involve formation thickened clump blood blood vessel, cause fatal blockages. Health officials U.S. included thromboembolic events among various types adverse events special interest monitoring Covid-19 vaccines get deployed large trial Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, authorized use U.S. late February, slightly blood clots among vaccine recipients among received placebo. Food Drug Administration said exclude possibility vaccine contributed higher number, plans monitor clots J&amp;J shot gets deployed larger Venous thromboembolism also occur people Covid-19. International Society Thrombosis Haemostasis, whose members include medical professionals treat blood clots, issued statement Friday recommending eligible adults continue get Covid-19 vaccine small number reported thrombotic events relative millions vaccinations suggest direct link. think it’s we’re still 2020 mode vaccines available. Every holiday preceded “will [holiday] super spreader?” punditry. 

Broadly speaking, takes right. year different millions people getting vaccines daily. Super Bowl Valentines Day come gone without massive waves. worrying SD refused lockdown cases spiked. Now, we’re seeing vulnerable susceptible inoculated.  main thing uninformed brain gone ""there must issue manufacturing batch went Europe, leading issues"". UK using AZ, India using limited issues well. Seems like AZ vaccine creates free rider problem. everyone getting vaccinated, rationally self-interested actor rejects vaccine due possible risk blood clotting, since they’ll still functionally complete protection COVID due herd immunity.  surely investigation needs centred Norway AZ jab whole? Norway fucked costing lives throughout Europe result. think good political move. said ""everyone July fourth"" would opened vaccination memorial day. said ""it'll safe vaccinate groups April first"" half states would done tomorrow  Got it, said virus muslim poor unvaccinated/unvaccinatable reservoirs came back said wrong unvaccinatable/unvaccinatable reservoirs anti-muslim slant threw children good measure figured obvious. everything ""virtually wrong"" butt hurt called mod lmao Follow here... immune response body reacting perceived invader producing antibodies, T-cells etc. body recognize threat respond whether virus vaccine. body would respond better vaccine real thing question. Vaccines treatments, there's nothing that's directly curative preventative antiviral, cause body immune response actual virus mimicking virus. Presumably, long covid lack response virus. deaths/miliion stat matters. 

your stat odds dying getting infected, high Brazil average age 30 years. average age Germany 45 years.

Manaus 8x deaths Hamburg, even similar pop size. 

The numbers get worst every week Brazil variants wil appear thanks Bolsonaro no-action policy. disgusting Yes, politicians duty care people represent. it’s actually health authorities/regulators making call, politicians. 

It’s politicians/regulators job instill confidence covid vaccines. Ignoring issue pretending doesn’t exist, it’s reported recipe disaster. You’re going whip public frenzy something wrong vaccine government hiding it. rational thing pause, investigate, conclude recommence vaccinations. look numbers. It’s difficult. 65 get vaccine disease pretty likely kill specifically. Natural selection finest. sure? I've seen anything say Germany seven cases. source (it's Paul Ehrlich report people usually cite)? Also, information I've seen Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (the rare disease cited Paul Ehrlich institute) shows [occurs 5 people per 3-4 suggest. 7 occurrences amongst 1.6 million actually average. factor UK Indian AZ vaccinations, occurrence actually lot smaller expect average - unless suggesting problem exclusive vaccine held EU?

Also, EMA reported saying 'the frequency events appeared lower overall incidence population.' conference gave morning.

Where getting contrary information from? it, though? It’s difficult question. answer would not. anybody thinks pace pharmaceutical innovation would without profit motive, they’re deluding themselves. 

Pfizer earned every fucking cent they’re going get far I’m concerned. EMA said one stop vaccinating review.

And today they've said connection.

 decision stop co-ordinated decision taken Germany, Italy Spain co-ordinated decision temporarily suspend Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine effort help protect public confidence, France’s industry minister said**, Sweden became latest nation suspend use shot. 
.**..In sign co-ordination European capitals, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi German chancellor Angela Merkel spoke Monday afternoon Italy announced suspension vaccine,** people familiar matter said. recent cuts deliveries AZ, J&amp;J, AZ Moderna deliver 50M doses end Q2 Q3 J&amp;J Moderna likely overtake AZ. vaccine market saturated EU Q3 anyway. First, want point isn’t issue poor children—it’s issue working class children, too. Electricians, plumbers, garbage workers, mechanics, police officers, health care workers, firefighters, utilities workers, many others can’t stay home. also aren’t enough put part-time schedules without society literally ceasing function. (Also worth noting people work government small businesses. aren’t lining corporate profits.)

All kids deserve quality education. getting hosed professional class home day help supervise kids. 

What pods San Francisco? googled finding nothing beyond articles wealthy parents startups. Oh, found article far behind minority students falling.

So let’s engage magical thinking pretend everyone like stay home kid day. everyone laptop job—society depends many people going work. Let’s engage magical thinking pretend implement nationwide pod system final months pandemic. Europeans given reminder who's charge recently governments gotten complacent assumed could get away anything. Particularly talking shit health care system government. eat dick. daughters 6 2. wife Moderna, know vaccine safe effective. would it. Cry salty boi. vaccine given 20 million people clearly safe, per EMA, MHRA WHO. Get it. mean yeah, Oxford/AZ vaccine works excellently sold cost... Nullifys argument right there. also may explain infections dropped like rock holidays. 25% population immune cut transmission 50%. think restaurants want open get back normal profit levels. they've crushed see wanting continue.

It co-ordinated. decision taken politicians. narrative sub (rightfully) moved optimistic one, hope people remember unsafe past year start judging people took utmost precautions. Like could easily see people start developing large hindsight bias start making fun level precautions people took. Saying things like ""people took levels precaution displaying anxiety, caution care safety others/themselves."" I'm already imagining friends completely befuddled tell traveled, gone date, ate restaurant year now. already see judgement sub regularly people take extreme precautions like wearing mask walks outside. 

We avoid reverse judgement. People protect risked loved ones (or even strangers... yes, people genuinely motivated empathy risk level vulnerable community) information had.

they already far far behind, go suspend one vaccines have...

EU whole 11.35 doses per 100 people, US 33.36 doses per 100 people, UK 39.02 doses per 100 people... assume must large number people open categories want vaccine.

It’s disgusting. thinking last night would mid-april adults get here.

I fear might right point it'll hard find appointment. experience Texas (Tyler, Waco, Fredericksburg, Canyon, Lubbock). Mask usage shockingly poor places. suspect less 50%. support vaccine rollout ground multiple times people suggest remove mask inside store.

I’ve traveled south recently I’m positive leaving public health decisions (like wearing masks) individuals always result poor outcomes.

The idea profit occurs customer puts dollar directly account side-effect consumerist, anti-long-term-thinking culture Hey man, totally support right make decisions yourself, without judgement.

I customers year (tradeshow industry) I'm finally booking shows Florida Texas, wife vaccinated, future finally looking better.

Each state lifts restrictions one state finally business again. also hope bite us butt, however feel pretty bitten already (financially, lost family COVID). Newsflash countries already use government bargaining get lower drug prices still Oxford vaccine open source change that.

ya wtf jay gimme shot pls called UK variant anyways?

Didn't move away putting country names diseases? Hell yeah. got first shot week ago, one week real protection kicks in. nearly thing. said yesterday would release statement today following fact major EU countries decided suspend use it. events occurred space 4 days.

They fortunately rightly maintained position non-causal relationship event vaccine. However, reviewing situations release findings Thursday. 

What saying EMA release statement release finding due events taken place past 4 days. Rendering link old news internet's age.

Check post history biting back though. anti-AZ person. went Saturday show work ID. I’ve friends turned away. norm. phrasing weird. I’m saying *because* vaccinated fine know safe effective (though poor sentence structure imply that), vaccine known safe effective, chose get it. seems science suggests risk, even children, posed vaccine smaller posed virus, thus would comfortable participating “entire scientific model” part volunteers needed “proper due diligence rigorous testing.” Sadly, point moot live far testing center. Alabama opening many people soon, hoping snag partner appointment heading point hospitalizations going faster faster every day vulnerable vaccinated. 

We likely near future, right hospitalizations decreasing smaller percentage week week time last month. Insanity. still way early. first thought well random kid effectiveness matter, likely matters lot kids.

At point someone first parent agonize choice whether join chicken pox vaccine trial mmr polio. EMA director highlighted recent conference, good they're cognizant &amp; think may aim make reasonable effort adjust potential artificial increase based way pointed without prompting point might well completely open up. Death rates 45 year olds can’t much higher 20 year old Brits vaccinated millions upon millions people, including young people, AZ country Europe. issues completely absent outside mainland.

Also India given tens millions doses, zero issues either.

Also numerous international national health agencies come saying link vaccine health problems. 

The Italian health regulator even said wanted keep using it, overruled politicians. really hope don’t roll side effects. imagine rough flu + corona vaccine side effects would be. 😭 covid shot kicked butt itself. think know reason fact many countries won’t fortunate vaccinate even year. 

Let's forget many people head crammed far ass get vaccine. Already got Indians tickets :) justify Martin Shkreli’s absurd price hike simple “theoretically, free markets work”? brief periode brain fog could number reason. likely body recovering. young people persistent debilitating symptoms many months/a year mild bout Covid harder explain physiologically. personally, here’s friend’s perspective you’re legitimately interested. he’s generally pro vaccine/pro science. It’s new hadn’t heard mRNA vaccines before; he’s young, healthy, zero risk conditions he’s aware of, really would like wait people gotten vaccinated comfort severe long term issues (ex. Chronic anemia requiring treatment one example cited due access insurance) aren’t going thing. Due age health isn’t super worried covid personally. 

I respect views part biggest things makes say 0.o fact lives someone matter swing high risk also vaccinated, may may get it. (Smoker lung tumors oxygen) CIA going CIA Tell got tattoo. Just...no lol. dose dose. talking fully vaccinated vs half vaccinated. Death also one many possible outcomes, like people know got az day+ headaches etc. doubt anyone checks longterm problems (which also consider corona). Thanks.
I'm still puzzled ""why"" part though. Would happen good reads it? Vaccines available EVERYBODY Ohio [starting March  tend agree. help tech literate inlaws (not great idiots either), refused look. thought someone would call them. unequivocally untrue.

How exactly supposed take ""this"" refers post? statement never made?

None post really relevancy saying disputing posters issue sex prostitutes ""better"" sex men sex men. false. make one inelgible.

But dispute said wrong

It incorrect eligibility limitations sexual contact place straight people all.

Yes, are. one, can't sex prostitutes. also can't prostitute.

It also incorrect sexual health related disqualifications actually contracted STD yes, there’s deferral period treatment.

Similar story above. sex prostitute, ineligible regardless whether contracted STD.


I get trying pick fight someone feel discriminatory practice, barking wrong tree posting comment merely discussing inaccuracy poster posted. Thanks! band practice tonight moving arm won’t problem lol texas cities... People took governor removing mandate mean masks outlawed that's case. Cities still enforce rules (so far). places MD aren’t checking age. need ID verify name matches one system. 1 year old account dozen posts suddenly activates spew directionless attacks AstraZeneca. Hmmm... haha. Damn, would appropriate. I'll use next time. Fresh u-boat. I'm quite old, otherwise I'd vaccinated ages ago. AZ shown 0 problems younger people UK. Well source removed due politics media matters entire article fox's coverage.

Here's transcript one segment. March last year. 

SEAN HANNITY (HOST): gotta real American people, like we're scaring people unnecessarily. unless immune system compromised, older, underlying health issues going die 99% virus, correct? 

DOUG COLLINS: correct Sean, good again. 

HANNITY: Alright that's point, mean they're scaring living hell people. see seeing like oh, okay, let's bludgeon Trump new hoax J&amp;J beginning deliver, Moderna supply much Q3 sort America first policy came along US funding them, AZ ongoing train wreck several months now. yeah, mostly Biontech carrying EU vaccination effort moment. come May, people still saying “Wait couple months”. Seems like opening eligibility 5m difference administered vs distributed right? governor (MA) loves complain capacity administer 2-3x constrained Federal supply (usually he's criticized), so, send em us national administered statistics. get downvoted issuing tiny amount hesitancy caution, regarding brand new therapies distributed world wide. place logical thinking, fear mongering. NHS workers given it. Many 20s 30s. Also many young people comorbidities given well.   Get nuance. could plausible.

The Pill long known increase risk blood clots low enough rate benefits often thought outweigh risks especially take account pregnancy also increases risk blood clots much greater extent. birth control estrogen comes increased risk formulations Pill shown come slighter greater risk others like Yaz facing lawsuits result. Get good good italian subs y'all maybe we'll consider protecting highway northern indiana get unscathed. Looks like previous administration, little odd since less combative Russia current. 

I think agree US exporting vaccines focus citizens....so care intervene another country obtaining vaccines elsewhere? don’t want Russia supply vaccines countries Western Hemisphere, need prepared share vaccines countries. initially read stepped U boat. Thanks switching English. I've US long German spelling atrocious. Plus keep forgetting capitalize damn **N**ouns! 

The EU situation giant mess. hope relatives (mostly elderly) still Mannheim area get vaccinated soon. manage come US, easily figure Pharmacies using Vaccine Finder website. show J&amp;J. Usually time booking told one get certain. mean that's good already identified this, booster production faster! mean like type Gating Criteria Reopening? Yikes, dude. First all, note said “theoretically”. obviously issues related access need solved. There’s indication governments world *won’t* paying line, rather individuals. See, example, every country socialized medicine. 

But ideally, many companies compete provide covid vaccines across world if/when mutations occur require new booster. *should* work. can’t deny type free (to varying extents) market capitalism driven huge amount R&amp;D across healthcare sector last 100 years, directly improved lives nearly every person planet. Granted, improvement equitably spread, case, rising tide actually lift boats. virtually nonexistent

That mean nonexistent. huge difference Hep C HIV. I'm sorry woke world view sometimes clashes reality. countries sick leave workers robust workplace safety protections workers? Gee, could “all except US” answer?

What countries medical care workers access without financial ruin? Gee, could “all except US” answer too?

What countries disability payments actually suffice post-COVID invalid live without starvation? I’ll give one guess ones don’t.

Those countries afford open schools risk slightly higher COVID rate that. US can’t. 

And happen children 500,000 dead people? children post-COVID invalids can’t work anymore? police officers plumbers electricians can’t work anymore get disability pay? sub become like UKIP circle-jerk lately. AZ vaccine people worried, possibly one recent batches do.

That distinction made regular folk. continue cast doubt vaccine, people flat refuse take it. matter decisions later reversed. really necessary Macron call vaccine quasi-ineffective 65s, despite evidence contrary? monumental act self harm many parts Europe enter dangerous 3rd wave. vaccine (almost time) dead inert virus. could dead/inert virus cause blood clots? dead pathogens caused blood clots, spontaneous blood clots wider issue, esp. children play around stuff, put fingers mouth often, etc? again, yes, tests use today definitely 100% accurate. least damn well near 100%.

Are referring to.... Rapid, home testing? That's HIV testing ~100% accurate. 

The CDC emphasize false negatives false positives INCREDIBLY rare. false negatives almost always happen within first weeks infection, mostly viral levels low enough undetectable. undetectable means untransmittable - need certain viral threshold order virus actually transmit even via direct blood contact. now. I'm far biologist think works like this:

Your body learn make antibodies getting injected. also really reason create antibodies keep current ones alive since ill. 

So think blood antibodies better donation blood without. agree statistics suggesting uncommon level rollout (millions people).
But seems odd one group within pretty much timeframe get exactly problem.

In Norway AZ given mostly one group people (HCW) mostly young, though also old, mostly women least traditionally dominate line work.

So statistics could thrown alone. imagine part halting.

The chance happening normal population due blood clot related strokes may small considered random, group mentioned random chance reason, imagine need figure why.

They type workers desperately need now, go healthy young people tell take needle random chance come fatal problem. also average ability cast doubt boost confidence among regular people vaccine safety imo. need feel safe.

This might considering begin with, think bubbled way WHO, EMA etc probably part consideration. Yup. We're getting interesting point pandemic.

Vaccines not. 

What percentage average persons life willing throw away virus kill many certain age group?

If work 80 years old average age, 12 months 1.25% life given virus much smaller percentage killing you. 

At point numbers make much sense. believe point coming soon. Go Gaels! already narcolepsy, worries get narcolepsy? Well Oxford's IP, actual development vaccine. could gone manufacturer. claim, however lack data over-65s lead authorities' recommendation, changed data available. not. specifically referring kinds occurrences talking about.

Also, people younger 50 expect suddenly pick blood disorder get tested antibodies ASAP want prove somehow Covid. mom got tested confirmed positive it. Antibodies indeed known fade months immune response good still. November. that's exactly they've several separate occasions past months. Macron said effective 65's, member German government claimed 8% effective. zero idea- largely due Brexit, terms UK getting vaccines quickly without much hold EU? sure vaccines approved UK event. focusing making sure ever pharmacy open mass vax sites trust doctor? could ask opinion next appointment. ridiculous states smarter others. Michigan, they're going open vaccines everyone age 16 April 5, meaning there's going absolute cluster f--k millions people flood system trying get appointments once. I’ve tracking it. Deliveries peak Tuesday reporting decline week. 14-day average sitting 2.7-2.9 million doses day March. 

My hunch 2.8 million per day new “plateau” little while, though I’m hopeful delivery mix include JNJ time. Think states low vaccine acceptance start losing supply states high vaccine acceptance still stuck 65+ phase? O-H-I-O stands ""Idiots Walking Around"" public health worker Ohio, really proud we’ve accomplished recently, really feel one best systems US. Agreed I'm socialist.

lmao swear 90% people know think Covid early got antibody tests came back negative. German efficiency! May, people say ""WHY MONTHS REEEEEEE""

No. Time reopen now. Texas Florida done well, states little restrictions. Yeah I'm sure everywhere different idea would successful PA. seems case Southern CA appointments showing available pharmacy websites, people able walk get relative ease.

Pharmacist give shots. Dr give shots randoms might come something else don’t care seeking vaccine I’m excited get back normal lot anxiety too. office doesn’t even reopening date yet I’m kind wondering like terms restrictions still exist weird feel commute again.

1. Persistence virus reservoir. vaccine promotes strong response spike protein immune response targets 'stealth' virus eliminates it.

2. Persistence viral debris reservoir. Cells pumping virions, pumping various proteins assemble whole virions, produce inflammatory response. basically terminal phase disease dribbling on. vaccine training spike protein would eliminate cells pumping spike, cells pumping proteins vaccine might clear those. Maybe inactivated virus vaccines include whole genome would better?
3. Autoimmune antibodies. there's virus left there's broad immune response caused infection left. introduction vaccine causes narrowing autoimmune response, increasing response targeted specifically virus proteins decreasing broad autoimmune response causing disease.

All three may taking place probably multispectrum disorder. viral persistence / viral debris cases less likely long-term since expected coronavirus persist body like herpesviruses. vaccine treatment also likely help cases though.

The likely case long COVID resembles ME/CFS may last years going autoimmune, going less likely fully resolved vaccination. likely happening given long COVID seems affect women men, women higher susceptibility autoimmune conditions.

And idea anxiety that's reason vaccine eliminates symptoms straight gaslighting. happened Gulf War Syndrome. Happened 9/11 responders. happened medical community ME/CFS sufferers. People posting upvoting shit ashamed they're doing. want long COVID people's heads ignore it, matter much put fascade genuine concern. Sorry one death many regardless circumstances.

That's works.

We *know* vaccines kill people. happens occasionally, usually allergic reaction. time spot gets bad, give hit epinephrine (which disables allergic reactions), call day. bad things happen. side effects, like Pandemrix vaccine H1N1 caused narcolepsy small subset patients. Simply put, injecting something entire population, sometimes hit bit unexpected chemistry.

The question ""will people die"" rather ""will statistically significant number people live"". vaccine mortality rate 1 1,000,000 protects disease kills 1 100, distribute vaccine mourn one person dies knowing 10,000 die good trade could get. Death inevitable population scale. unfortunate, also reality.

So question ask response AZ vaccine twofold: ""did vaccine cause clots"", ""will people die COVID waiting alternative vaccines would die AZ vaccine"". choice hypothetical 2% chance dying COVID (depending risk factors) .002% chance dying pulmonary embolism, may fair trade. argument one aunt 70. eligible say, can't bothered go make appt. Argh. Luckily 81 year old Great uncle get first shot Pfizer.. 1 20 relatives. game changer again, bleak?

A booster would likely year, two years line. There’s many vaccines require frequent booster doses throughout childhood

They’re saying people likely recommended get third dose maximum protection current variants, futur may need get booster shots

Seems like pretty small price pay normality Back desktop now. [figure [figure [figure 1]

The Israel one pfizer, pfizer moderna identical trials. also noticed day 12, day 13... one said work SA variant astrazeneca? Yeah, put Pfizer efficacy numbers next efficacy numbers AstraZeneca let people free choice. 

AZ would lose. 

Pfizer next generation vaccine unimaginably huge sum biotech money behind it. going use tech kinds interesting things people want.

AZ-like vaccines would make due didn’t mRNA biotech. suspend EU countries, leave as-is others hedging European Union giant social experiment first place. Good tip!

I live close Cincinnati - I've got little research see :) lol Funny, people start pharma companies time. “Any ole person” generally incapable so, though, top generalities starting business, pharma requires extensive experience highest levels education make significant gains existing products knowledge, *significant* capital investment production R&amp;D. Drug discovery expensive. Deal it. looked volunteering family. fairly late stage trial common vaccine recipients children. Ohio definitely state drive way Michigan. Thanks switching English. I've US long German spelling atrocious. Plus keep forgetting capitalize damn Nouns!

Ah, worries, thought like hope relatives (mostly elderly) still Mannheim area get vaccinated soon. 

Well, technically 70+ eligible age since last week, enough shots.

I've checked travel rules change, EU still banned now. So, thanks, guess i'll wait more. put context, population EU 445 million (Wikipedia).

So that's 1 dose (of 2 required) every 44 people.

About 2.3%. Hey worked hard year go fro Obese Overweight Normal. one Ohioans. :) want hear justify charging prices service. need food live, guess what: given free, be. Oops, missed J&amp;J, bad! I’m really sorry won’t able wedding honeymoon you’ve dreamt of. would sad see family masks wedding day too. I’d really like vaccines thing lets us get back true normal in, mandated wear masks. don’t mind becoming normalized even planes doctors offices sick. irony lot misinformation delivered public. virus ever slowly defeated people get vaccine, immediately go lives previous pandemic. read truth matter vaccine takes anywhere 14-30 days build immunity within body. get vaccine today mean free constraints placed apex pandemic. 

YOU STILL CONTRACT VIRUS RECEIVING VACCINE IMMUNE SYSTEM DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES!!!!!! wording heavily misleading. ""pick *one* smallest 21 states"", ""everyone smallest 21 states"". Nice try Russian bot. Russia usually excellent science, sadly people accept political reasons want hear justify charging exorbitant prices vaccine pretty much necessary normal life resume, mention millions high risk people need it. seems pretty freaking bad me. F  like double that. 35% end feb (18.5m doses) done nearly 25m another situation like next decade, I'm selling house moving most-backwoods rural state find. mental wellbeing can't handle another year social isolation. Shit happens, mistakes made, corners cut, supplies mislabeled. process ever 100%  I've saying since literally last April.

Many policies recommendations epidemiologists come heavily weighted toward public health away mental wellbeing, economy, individual liberties, things negatively impacted policies. worst exist vacuum literally nothing matters outside reducing COVID deaths.

You exclusively listen epidemiologists recommend reason exclusively listen economists recommend. balanced approach done since start instead we've spent last year trying implement much get away without causing public backlash. need learn mistakes we're doomed repeat them. Incredible, thank much. Oh haha also joke Office.

Edit: reply referencing. That’s fair point, July anyone wants vaccinated chance to. addition, vaccinated, solid data vaccination prevents asymptomatic covid transmission. I'm actually impressed turn around Massachusetts. went one slowest states one top ten percentage supply used, almost number doses administered. I'd appreciate little clarity Baker's reopening messaging, suppose we'll see goes. 31.2 here. first time lazy worked while. Don’t forget communizing deaths trust, politician, scientist? always spend moments grocery stores coming cold waving glasses around like madman get defog, especially masks. I'm sure I'm person wacky glasses dance King Sooper's heh Home depot live within drivable distance Wolstein center Cleveland I’d start looking now. booked mine morning 29th there. Im pretty sure 220 million Pfizer/Moderna 20 million J&amp;J British Twitter full it, including smart educated people know better. basically vaccine nationalism (""how dare criticise vaccine""). Time tell expect false alarm, honestly fuck people baselessly accusing foreign governments (of allies less) killing citizens save face. Wish could donate see antibodies dealing covid help ppl cant donate 110 pds im 103 :( (Im 4'11 fast metabolism healthy me) surprised PEI recommends vaccines specific age group, namely 55+. EMA would calculating based whole EU, cases would statistically insignificant them. Germany considered German sub-populaion. given Germanys 'data evidence' 'cover corners' attitudes, there'll definitely restricted use AZ investigation over. comparison 10 young women per 1 million die due blood clots contraceptive pill. 2.3% 3 months according study continues drop time goes on. PVS happen virus, anything new.
 Come July think place formal mask mandate would plane. going politically impossible mandates elsewhere come summer. physical cause what, exactly? Literally anything person feels potential covid diagnosis labeled long covid. actual long-covid symptoms similar symptoms people viral infection. 

And there’s stuff. Simply, mechanism vaccine clear long-covid symptoms. studies anecdotes true, symptoms psychosomatic, else MASSIVE problem need stop vaccinating immediately vaccines something body shouldn’t able do. Aan te least explains insane positivity rates case numbers detected Czechia October onwards. would surprised variant spread across Central Europe beyond fall. article: President Joe Biden said Tuesday United States talks several countries get extra doses COVID-19 vaccines.  talking several countries already,” Biden told reporters left White House promote coronavirus stimulus package Pennsylvania. “I’ll let know shortly.” already depending state. I’m Cleveland mass vaccination site downtown scheduled appointment 29th morning. explain think bleak?

I mean think it’s awful Pfizer seems intend gauge population, third dose booster shot, people forget two doses initially aren’t booster, that’s fully vaccinated.

So find bleak might need booster shots Pfizer immoral? Cause booster part many expecting Got mine last Friday like someone turned light dark cave me. realize freeing feeling would be. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I've seen language saying ""you need appointment show up"" ""don't call vaccine, use online portal"".

Walking asking something I've tried yet, also something hard scale. search pharmacies 50 mile radius half hour, probably visit one two time.

(state PA, btw). Meanwhile Washington.... ratio incidence curve efficacy. give raw numbers sample size small. also symptom onset day, day infection we'd want, subtract 5ish days. 

It looks like 90%+ efficacy preventing symptomatic infection starting 5-7 days gradual increases that. timeline preventing infecting others longer, one Israel paper viral load looks like 75%+ reduction 13 days gradual improvement that.

Interestingly combine two appears contagiousness ends day 8. Though can't rule vaccination confounding factor. Deal! Haha Hey Sasquatches people too. I'd agree saying engage. really unlikely anything say chance someone fixed beliefs, like gdtags captains say start interacting media think interested seeing same. 

I think take deep breath, say fellowship, keep side street clean sphere Almost 70% people 65 vaccinated least one dose US. I'd wager 75% total want get shot category (75% vaccination rate huge success, IMO).

With hospitalizations decreasing 12% 7-day average, majority people 65 protected, vaccine supply constantly increasing, think time every state opens flood gates everyone come April (like Ohio announced). could back 100% normalcy rate come June Doctors scientists qualified give recommendations give. economic degrees. simply shouldn’t giving recommendations restrictions. long get free sticker!

Sweet dreams ❤️😤 also millions millions people covid already interested getting vaccine yet. Hi! 3 days ago, entire work staff vaccinated (about 10 people), nearly everyone experienced side effects J&amp;J shot. keep hearing side effects evidence immune system generating response. feel anything. possible vaccine work me? know J&amp;J vaccine lesser efficacy (for many reasons) possible immune response means work? Well, screw whole family matter grammy grammpy get first it? Well that's gotta dumbest fucking moderation I've ever seen. Um, there's almost 375 million people two countries combined. 
Most experts think need 70% population vaccinated order achieve herd immunity. guess 6mths would optimistic best. women vaccine short term cannot mammograms since increase false positives. wife second dose weeks back last week went mammogram got turned away inflamed lymph nodes vaccines causes appear problematic lead invasive biopsies. proved texas stupid. I’ll take whatever give knowing luck I’d catch Covid waiting “better” vaccine. Don’t pretend care anyone yourself, said much.  like phone industry already. released one already leaks upcoming vaccine out. talking entire pool 350 million.

Yes talking entire pool.

You're falling victim [Look Elsewhere related [P ignoring vaccines, hospitals symptoms outcomes occurred people vaccine.

At point time basically expected would one cluster one symptom one hospital somewhere world.

Your brain goes ""whoah that's weird, something special one hospital"" entirely due random chance headlines make focus one event exclusion hundreds millions vaccinations given. need start opening eligibility divert resources places like Maharashtra. Lmao sad thing people dont look test country smh No, stop wearing masks indoor situations whenever possible. post responding said, indoor places still enforcing masks.

I believe time bars restaurants start opening 25-50% capacity. vulnerable among us work vaccinated. colleagues traveling going bars/restaurants. time us start assessing personal risk tolerance taking personal responsibility. really hate Reddit notifications show profile pic zoomed in.

Australian health minister went hospital due skin infection. I'm going supply source this, nutcase, spend 5 seconds googling it.

Data UK suggests least efficacy Pfizer one 6 weeks actually [higher UK also suggests almost neck neck side effects both. In-fact, comes thrombotic events, [Pfizer more. Still lower expected amount general population.

It ""disagreeing agreeing"" you, fact wrong clearly spurious agenda supplied proof data batshit insane claims.

Where get spreading misinformation? usual receiver benefit add-on like plasma therapy? would never trust Russian vaccine.

Stop thinking modern countries Europe dumb smarter info 
The big red flag multiple western countries stop vaccine AstraZeneca vaccine cheapest vaccine. costs $2 Anyone else noticing friends suddenly asma never knew about? evidence shows vaccines proven provide mucosal immunity, even leave Fauci this, cite sources say that. want provide sources, would peer reviewed unlike Israel analysis?

Do mean got sources say proven? I've seen lot - previous studies take time test that, manufacturers sensibly wanted get approved arms soon possible. last weeks we'd expect see first real studies, seen them, Israel [and evidence actually provide real world? so, I'd interested seeing that. Nah he's brock Samson taking about. Oatmeal raisin gma coookies shit. would great vaccinating poorest citizens dense urban areas, seem actively looking rural isolated parts country sending there. poor dense areas places like Iztapalapa Mexico City received zero doses; isolated towns mountains Sinaloa (my state) vaccinated.

Be may, point long shots put arms, it’s good enough. doctor talk it? sounds scary. might fine deal that, first dose give immunity. excellent.

I would like subscribe newsletter! Gamestop trading vaccines now? Yes. It’s important distinction apparent original post.

Hoping get closer situation soon! knew respirators protect fully, since outsourced production China blew strategic reserves, any. lied, said, keep medical industry.   

I know motive 3ft now. speculate, maybe indication discontent possible riots via analyzing social media trends, people can't send kids school doable keep 6ft+ good ventilation. sure could try article almost month long like 1 year Covid time. Plenty people 40-65 end hospital severe damage covid non zero amount die. top 60-70 percent 65 + one dose. Lifting mask mandates doesn’t make sense. wait another month two remaining percent vulnerable refuse vaccinated. Wear masks green tier, permanently. Fucking lol. sounds like get arm full node closer injection site learning responding stuff taking vaccine for. We're taking vaccine train immune system react. good thing. Well done!!! Running pretty fun get hump starting. people over-run (go faster pace, extend stride) first start, know run long distance. 

You give another go. year Jurassic Park came out. Connecticut announced anyone 16+ make appointment starting April 6th Courage hear conversations time friends, family coworkers wants vaccine.  Michigan April 5th! r/shittylifeprotips USA: that's cute

but real that's impressive Yeah it’s normal small price pay try protect people couple months get vaccinated. Certainly better keeping restrictions economic costs. want say but... really tbh. We're lagging US we're less right behind Europe. Canada's administered doses per capita 10 days behind EU's numbers. Really pretty decent. exact thing happened fam. Husband tested positive, never symptoms within hour his. Neither us tested positive antibodies donating blood. cases pretty mild perhaps influences antibody situation? feel strange knowing. Looking forward getting vaccinated feel better all! magical world close borders virus spreads within country, sure. time border closures start appear make sense it’s always going late.

Not mention, always people need enter country, whether it’s stranded citizens, government officials people involved essential international trade. Closing borders completely impossible. it’s not. allows people chance get vaccinated lifting least restrictive mandate. I'll take 2 Moderna 2 Pro Max, Please. though- cards give go CDC database pull verify birthdate lot number. feel like presenting vax card negative covid test enough. Make so!  
  
^(Get it? Next Gen...I'll see out) nope, still that: north dakota particular said recently march ""assure supply second doses"": + 8870% markup = $313.95 Good !
I hope reduces staff 50% . 40 condition considered make higher risk, J+J one much less hassle believe mRNA ones terms percent end hospitalized severe complications, few. think difference may *slightly* higher chance could get infected experience something like cold flu J+J one, hard tell since vaccines tested different times lot variables working favor mRNA ones look better. 

I'm higher risk choice time anyway went Pfizer. requires 2 doses, 2nd one 3 weeks first full efficacy reached around 2 weeks 2nd dose. Trade me? really want Vancouver. I'm far Peace Arch either haha. think sample population actually cares others, given donation blood. think anti maskers would even higher infection rate actual number cases could potentially double number reported cases. still got time delete even big field. NYC regularly gets 50,000 finishers now. someone lives border support system friends lives Canada, agree. many loved ones separated mental health shot many reasons, also, I'd like able see someone physically person know, even 6 feet apart. really brutally isolating lonely phone calls cutting it. I’m denying wear masks US, many people make seem like population far masked actually are. There's proof unicorns exist, guess throw basic logic window investigate immediately. No, highly unusual. hematologist responsible treating Norwegian patients said never seen exact combination symptoms before. IL pretty well, know hell talking about. 

22% population received first dose, 12% fully vaccinated. total 4,297,000 doses administered state population 12,7 million. 83% delivered doses administered. state fifth nation total doses given. Pfizer vaccine UK caused clotting events AZ, stopping one well?

Source: Add Sweden list... parents got vaccinated last week, f\*cking hell.... Anders Tegnell says, translation Swedish Tegnell comments Astra Zeneca vaccine state epidemiologist tells TV4 reports different type side effect blood clots cases quite serious symptoms form disorders, says Anders Tegnell first reports appeared Friday, according previous reports blood clots. types blood-related side people get clots different parts body, others get small bleeds Tegnell says symptoms appeared one two weeks fairly serious disorder system body, says Tegnell. least extra pint. Usually surgical tools get sterilized autoclave heating high temperature (above 110°C) pressure. kills bacteria viruses, prions stay infective. Unfortunately known time people got infected surgery. okay known risk clearly stated little piece paper supposed read.

That's fundamentally different unknown, communicated risk serious injury death.

People fine risk actually aware give people vaccine. US **land** borders closed Mexico Canada. Air sea “borders” open countries. blood. Mainly blood neighbor's father died (CJD) last year. real. stupid statement, EU suspend AZ. makes really hard start believing conspiracy theories planned. mean see reason would this, actions far seem scream politicians absolutely fine mess hurry get us it. 

Also beyond disgusting people discriminate restrictions age risk, comes vaccinations immediately looking ways discriminate. Either we're together boomers stay fuck home till chance get vaccinated, together we're stopping nonsense die. casually dropped 'blood clots' missed whole point investigation. matter world perceives. PEI saw increased CVT short period time among German vaccinated group might caused deaths investigating. There's nothing wrong that. Eh looks like EU truly screwed pooch AZ, increase vaccine scepticism already vaccine sceptic countries. UK happily take unwanted doses hands though, send over! want covid shit. shit sherlock telling exact incidence rate exact issue found Pfizer AZ UK UK stopped using either, like shouldn't. person expressed confidence countries outside EU would well seems case. one suspendig either Pfizer AZ reason assume AZ's vaccine causes blood clots Pfizer's, incidence rate both. testing drug humans free? pay them? thought medical trials paid for. Strange.. yes, yes absolutely is, everything EU last year flawed go jail negligence Ofcourse ( Indian ) suggestion EU AZ vaccine passes EMA tests. OP distrust vaccine EU created population. Next week total vaccine deliveries drop third week row. guess extent rest EU. frustrating. I'm guessing yes fuck love brought vaccination passports 1% population fully vaccinated. paperwork bureaucracy place 10 times important vaccinations. 

Maybe first vaccinate 30% think going crazy arranging paperwork people's holidays? Still, take away fact blood clotting reason countries suspended vaccination. 

I don’t know risk levels health institutes around Europe assuming, clearly something going on, especially similar cases seen UK (which arguably highly suggests AZ serum intended form cause incidents)

I hope get bottom find source illnesses, also AZ vaccine proven safe. India China wanted do. softpower get immense. hilarious really. sub shit America India throughout past year, push comes shove realize lick american indian boots get need. China sending vsccines matter most

Vaccines whose results verified anyone credibility. highly doubt many countries stopping AZ 37 reported cases, clearly something else play information us. they're invested EU vaccinating send doses we're currently scaling vaccination efforts due low AZ deliveries. stop using AZ vaccine stop UK vaccination programme tracks. things stand, there’s reasonable chance could restrictions lifted end June, reliant able administer AZ vaccine one of. It’s true vaccines way many months arrive numbers needed. someone insight knowledge please break process me? production process viral vector vaccines entail? steps shortest possible time production plant start delivering doses? take time equip production plants question? ways new production capacities speed production? 

Basically, *want* believe new production plants could start delivering doses June. truth important I'd like case be, though, could someone please break me? whose fault that? 

I'm saying enough vaccines I'm super aware lack them.


But thought point going ""utter incompetence German/EU government"". Pausing rollout risk free choice. Would concerned handful cases DVT pulmonary embolism background incidence 1 1000 per year general population, answer no. Yes I've heard strange unusual cases brain clots, seems localised cases Norway. Covid CFR 0.5-07%, even thromboembolic cases linked vaccine (highly doubtful) we're talking somewhere region 0.0005%. oral contraceptive pill way higher risk causing clots seem OK that. Well bunch nationalists would love bar world anything country needs first. Thats they‘re pat shoulder ‚their‘ vaccination effort paying off. 

It always amazes fast americans change ‚we‘ individuals care other. 

And yes eu might messed parts buying process still don‘t hinder companies selling vaccines wartime measures. Canada ""order States"", order AZ. AZ produces vaccines Canada decide. lol several places didnt open numbers still growing + free tests weeks now. please keep talking ass Yes let’s make wear masks playing high intensity sport. won’t cause people pass Funny norms different places. Israel outdoor musks hardly debate. massive orders necessarily improve delivery times, order enough every vaccine showed lots promise. way matter one shown effective safe, would orders it. 2 questions:
Should stop wearing masks?
Should stop social distancing indoors? know people immuno-suppressants concerned reactions vaccine still weirdos every group developed world hardly countries using Sinovac. hard even find news articles English. India really high population I’m COVID nurse. advice would like? Right! needs consent anyway?! It’s case live. Get can. Period. That’s Walgreens is. trying late February fierce still- guess it’s opening getting easier. I’ve fully vaccinated 3 weeks. SIL. I'm literally shaking right Plus there’s 7-10 day gap time doses allocated time go arms. always difference million doses. Upvoted thanks try Walmart again. cvs told doses period idea come plus Kroger pharmacy’s bad attitude I’d basically given up. Sooo happy live do. 99% people know getting vaccine. half friends family already gotten it. really wanted address children’s struggles, need make sure attending school well-ventilated environment, preferably outdoors, adequate social distancing COVID precautions taken. 

You want struggles? kids live multigenerational households rely grandparents childcare. happens Grandma dies COVID?

Some kids’ parents support network. happens parents get sick time? takes care kid? (This nightmare scenario year, btw - get sick, takes care 5 year old? one). 

For matter, many kids financially edge dire poverty. happens one parents can’t work month? become homeless? go hungry? 

This children’s well shouldn’t pretend is. It’s getting parents back full time work interruptions. Fauci unless said it

Meaning care Fauci talk like state sponsored study agreement company made vaccine isn’t credible study

State sponsored would much credibility company made it, since company made conflict interest promote product; fact, fiduciary responsibility shareholders maximize profit, literally required law hype products (or least, ignore study negative). even Israel could conflict interest wants claim vaccine used lot working great invest economy!!! Either way, peer reviewed study removes bias entities have, company obviously way conflict obviously gonna positively peer reviewed

Okay let's wait is, come back post say whatever, cannot cite take study seriously guy admitted lying initial mask statements beginning pandemic

Okay, Journal Allergy Clinical Immunology (peer reviewed study) showed ""that people recover natural Covid-19 infections develop antibodies protect mucosal regions respiratory tract, evidence yet true vaccine-induced immunity."" - citing peer reviewed study? Well, definitely love jobs ease getting overtime. family member used CO met many CO's heard make 100K+ year working 70-80 hours week, 1.5x OT, 2x+ holidays. necessarily, Kosovo Djibouti never part EU they're dragging feet along vaccinations at? called multiple places told don’t checked mid morning. could also selected days future. could’ve also gone bunch local Walgreens. you’re comfortable with, it’s life.

While Israel already already begun vaccinating Palestinians, PA refused several Israeli offers work jointly, including offer vaccinate Muslim worshippers:

""Israeli officials reportedly sent request last week Palestinian Authority Jerusalem Muslim Waqf asking Israeli government allowed open coronavirus vaccination station Temple Mount area, request rejected.

The station meant vaccinate mainly Palestinian worshipers visiting mean it’s really much conspiracy theory inject water, it? everything far fetched know?

Logged one morning saw tons appointments. difference making mRNA codes protein cell, somewhere, short period time get immune cells respond vs. getting mRNA right cells sufficient quantities still enormous challenge though. usual comes drug delivery people. Even lab barely deliver mRNA efficiently cells dish, delivery practically non-issue off-target effects afterthought.

It's still probably lot closer using mRNA therapies treat cancer, every technology much easier apply infectious disease cancer... 🙄 Google cdc estimates. Ranges see 4x 8x total amount documented cases. Curious live that’s still “locked down”. I’m things pretty normal it’s big liberal city. may case areas country, absolutely case high demand areas like cities. virtually 0 “no waste doses” places need concussion know going bad... there's ""little evidence concern"" ""warning"" experts.

Crappily written headline. Totally agree, since blood donors go lot effort donate blood, want save people’s lives. hand might less people donating anxiously sitting home going anywhere ordering food groceries, it’s really representative whole population. Also blood donors 65 younger, might less concerned catching covid seniors. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Yeah, weird cited Sundays. Neat, really topic though 🤷‍♂️ still 2 weeks second shot reach reported immunity level. Like pfizer vaccine reported effectiveness 95%, that's 2 weeks second dose. It'll increasingly effective time, it'll lower eventually be. get tested every single day. We’re talking consoles here. Get vaccine. I’ve saying city I’m in. metro area 4,000,000 people - going can.

I feel like dashboards check never change noon onwards. proof vaccine either

we need trust governments due dilligence keep us safe countries already pulling support shows experts know random people reddit saying ""sure safe"" citation true though? privelege working home plenty educators food service workers think much risk am. really feel ethical skip line daily risk exposure often 0, compared folks. Nope, basically can’t accurately say closely real # infections mask impede normal life. whatever. LOL. He’s trolling. He’s made comment again. Anyone good idea cross-reactive antibodies non SARS-2 infections might play part? Speculation today US would approve April. That's difference. even then, there's question needed.  time approved, US hopefully swimming supply mRNA vaccines 1-shot vaccines.

With said, I'm hoping loosen grip AZ supply (and note, Canada wants US allow AZ export plant Canada contract supply AZ vaccines, actually donate loan supplies them) Pfizer Moderna show reliability hitting Q1 targets J&amp;J production picks up.  Canadians realize position US in, exactly fault US stance. bet big vaccines profiting it. hope pragmatism kicks sometime soon.

In honestly though, think NovaVax Canada's biggest hopes significant early source increased supply. note, bleak Canada. yes, slow comparison States, UK, world leaders vaccination rates, still think pace see fairly normal summer. *The teachers union entered chat.* understand positivity rate indication well country testing (and hopefully quarantining positives tests) every positives there’s lots contacts negative also still colds going around negative (plus lots negatives tests everyone getting procedure done hospital). 

If 50% tests positive nowhere close testing enough help contain spread. less 5% Bazooka?

Neutron bomb?

Grenade? Yep, Canadian conservatives back shut vaccine manufacturing. Wee conservative policies... friend obese 40s got today Kaiser. Based comment think calling texas stupid comment, never anything ever.

Or follow advice people know talking opportunity take it. faster get heard immunity better. That’s sentiment I’ve hearing healthcare providers. Way, way behind. embarrassing really. Bold assume 2021 need proof anything make wild accurate claims getting appointments California? One person circle needs vaccine. Nice - like hear. Definitely Fauci unless said it. talk like state sponsored study agreement company made vaccine isn’t credible study. It’s obviously gonna positively peer reviewed. Yes, take study seriously guy admitted lying initial mask statements beginning pandemic.  Okay. *any* measurement attack rate using instead? (me included) arriving 1/3 taking 550,000 deaths dividing 0.5% IFR get 110 million infections? Oh know. Says someone country people still use paper checks.

What weird line attack. Like said, don’t want guinea pig, I’ll watching optimism.

Based comment, never anything ever. sure needs addressed. ship ""lesser"" vaccines abroad people want them. Pfizer Moderna producing considerable clip. Doubtful. Israel issues getting population Arabs go get vaccinated. Depending webpage one looks seems somewhere low 40%'s.

As Israel vaccinating non-citizens countries working Israel addition 133k (was supposed ~100k) West Bank workers Jordan. Israel's rate hit 108.3 doses given per 100 people (UK 38.6 US 32.3). countries suspending usage articles/news floating around blood clots. Without context average person reads going worried. Combine bad press Oxford vaccine gotten efficacy vis vis SA variant easy understand layman might get scared. 

That blood clots might unrelated gets buried ""sexy"" headlines. That’s exactly thinking. Hey PM me!

Good point! Interesting thoughts embarrassing us. parts world back normal live concerts again. cant even figure simple plan get vaccines. Sad. Millions vaccinated USA. still can’t decide vaccine passports it’ll elitist? Fuck that. Fucking ridiculous. Everyone could need proof vaccination thousand reasons. Going dentist? Hospital? Volunteer hone? Travel? Let’s get shit together get world technology already. governor Kentucky said mask mandate lifted LEAST end May

This reasonable timeline even optimists like Daily Discussion thread agree ""we know sure vaccines stop transmission need masks""

Data hints there's enough studies done seems like refuses acknowledge thing almost over, little plan reopening.

I take care grandmother live offered dosage, live elders medical workers opportunity yet. care COVID, think studying bible supersedes restrictions.

They highest vaccination rates 60+ early on, current rates are:

83% 50+ vaccinated recovered.

75% 16+ vaccinated recovered. Nice, know Portugal included that, I'm little relaxed, hope ends soon vaccine program amazing they’re heavily right leaning state abundance vaccine since they’re citizens refusing shot? mean ask probably know No, not. sub overrun rabid anti-EU people like make shit up. im mistaken Israel test drugs many times relies fda approval determine something safe not. Quick question anyone answer...my mom got covid early January since recovered. She’s eligible vaccine since works healthcare doctor won’t let get right making wait April due antibodies thinks she’ll react badly gets now. true? Like personally don’t believe there’s reason wait put horror story head won’t even get says now. Americans taking Covid seriously. ones make news politics loud assholes. nations, still majority. 15-20% growth week week numbers. Last Monday 18% less. way while. keeps going, we'll 4M mid April.

Also say 240M doses made April 1,that means allocated distributed/shipped. reach distributed, could extra 10 days. Weasel words Unfort. looks pace 240M shipped 4/10. Whatsa whronga wit you? ""I'm expert"" Who? US exceeding original estimates. Fauci: rate, might say it’s okay masked outdoor dining 2022. Won’t long till make connection. (Covid fertility) Can’t tell good news bad news (major hesitancy?) Yeah vaccinated folks super low risk. strong evidence attack rate even within households vaccinated people quite low, let alone general interactions That’s I’m concerned too. CA idea adult could eligible May feel like stretch goal thats lot people actually want shot, it’s hard (not impossible) get appointment demand. isn’t demand states worrisome. south, lot Covid deniers, mention Vaccine skepticism among black communities. good combination. Look. totally understand believe. Totally. understand fair core people USA radicalised way.

Obviously nothing common damned liberals. willing stop sucking prosperity truly stand alone? agricultural subsidies? tax disparity? 

Cause heading think called 'libertarians' would mewing like kittens get back civil society paid real toll beliefs. he’ll get months! Canada's vaccine roll going relatively poorly. need hundred infected Americans going (or Canadians coming getting returning home) spread amongst relatively unprotected population. schools back person.

Malls, restaurants (sitting outside green passport needed), bars, gyms etc open fully vaccinated recovered. Weddings 300 (up 10% without green passport), sports events, concerts, theaters 500 Green passport. Hotels etc open green passport.

Take note something like 75% adults now. Kids/non green passport eligible negative test within last 7 days.

Remaining meaningful restrictions air travel (limited destinations), caps large gatherings dance clubs, open next week.

Take note lot places actually check green passport, especially bars restaurants. real feasible way check weddings either. think that's particularly odd. Alaska pretty low cases throughout whole thing (both relative absolute terms) probably huge level natural immunity there. 30% vaccinated nice all, still quite ways herd immunity (not mention course first dose full immunity). Actually Alaska seems like decent example rushing 100% open everything right now, really well vaccination still yet making much dent spread virus. need MUCH 30% shut down. Think he's talking people work 9-5 unable get shot. history books 4 millitary coups tell same. Smart. would take unknown risk known one? first lie always wins. You’re right, he’s bad googling. Look “Trump hoarding vaccines” find you’re talking hopefully idiots same. guys ""ramp rate"" US, 5 weeks behind. catch US today 22nd April. America banned exports probably lift ban anytime soon, think Brazil producing vaccines and/or exporting India, China EU hope time “all call” vaccine gets CA 24/7 vaccine sites. would 100% go get jab 3am. There’s many people otherwise. extra arm sounds pretty cool though Kinda funny milder things gets deleted mods keep showing ass guess. get laid. Okay ""Few,"" disqualify level concern. disqualify looking it.

""dass die Politik oder öffentliche Meinung sich danach ausrichtet ist eine Illusion"" 

Das habe ich auch nicht behauptet. Unehrliche Unterstellung. 

Deine Aussage zu den Blutgerinnseln wiederum ist entweder bloß ignorant oder gar bewusst bösartig. 

Natürlich sind ein paar Dutzend Blutgerinnsel nicht viel (wobei zu bedenken ist, dass das die *sofortigen* Wirkungen sind, mittelfristig können das noch viel mehr sein), aber du hast bewusst unterschlagen, wie die beschaffen sind. 

Nämlich so, dass sie quasi nur junge Menschen betrifft und es sich um eine sehr atypische Form eines Blutgerinnsels handelt, die sonst quasi nie auftritt. 

Jaja, German Angst. deutsch sogar, dass sie sogar die Niederlande, Dänemark, Norwegen, Irland, Bulgarien und Thailand erfasst hat. Die werden alle von unser ""Angst"" platt gerollt wie damals Ostpolen. 

Ehrlich gesagt scheinst du mir nicht wirklich einem Diskurs interessiert. Im Übrigen ist es gut, dass sich auch Organisationen für die Verträglichkeit des Impfstoffes aussprechen, und ich bin durchaus der Überzeugung, dass das berücksichtigt werden sollte. 

Allerdings ignoriere und leugne ich im Gegensatz zu dir durchaus nicht die Organisationen, die sich dagegen aussprechen. 

""Hört auf die Wissenschaft, aber nur wenn sie mir zustimmt."" machine let 165999 people walk dismembered 16600th sure hell walk it. Would you?

That machine exists, lot effective one example, killing every 103rd person ([US point life.

Vroom vroom. old news last December. Since then, EU bought several extra doses BioNTech Portugal part EU scheme.

Also 4.5M J&amp;J equivalent 9M AZ. far know, biggest issue simply theres enough vaccines course theres timetable vaccines arrive might hit 500,000 day weeks 50/50 pfizer/astrazeneca whole population. However two groups astrazeneca likely provided majority doses vulnerable 65 larger, vaccinated later astrazeneca available vaccine recently due supply. Yeah husband objectively skinny like .6 qualifying based BMI Europe still exporting vaccines, us not. sum up. Canada never allow they're far insistent tourists evil. God forbid someone (international) fun pandemic! know three people serious allergies point anaphylactic shock, three got Pfizer vaccine without issues.

A doctor could compare known allergies components vaccines give better advice. think future probably get answers need make informed decision. say doctor says stand near microwaves, asks details, point article saying there's really danger microwaves. subtle way saying doctor quack? slowly precaution think, lot restrictions left clubs supposed open next week Logical reaction, panic reaction.  vaccine must safe. Worst Case getting nothing US done, likely June-July.

So saying bottling might the

_sunglasses_ Getting first dose week cannot fucking WAIT get exercise without mask. gym allow ~6 weeks now. panic

People pessimistic, peer pressure works, everyone eligible see action actually China concentrated effort project soft power couple decades now. differently USA USED to. 

I big fan China recognise playing game skilled level.

But keep hurr hurring - could possibly go wrong? liability like know could problem someone else dies even pause? agree. overall safety vaccine questioned UK alone 17m doses administered?

If anything (and probably even this), suspend batches safe side. point getting vaccine getting seriously impacted disease.

the point masks get infected less likely infect others.

Not lot people maintain ""social distance"" Israel, masks still required precaution public unless restaurant/bar(since eat drink) gym/doing physical activity. even really enforced outside, get enforced many stores/supermarkets. tried hint at, weighing know facts. agree would probably right call outside pandemic wrong emergency situation like current one. pandemic review regulatory processes hope adjustments regulatory bodies behave emergencies bigger risks taken.

Btw general believe pandemic rather useful preparing us potentially deadly pandemic. Yeah vast vast majority actually vulnerable COVID vaccinated. drop restrictions once? I'm talking portugal, know read News AstraZeneca lead provider portugal vaccination plan 

 ""The covid-19 vaccines Portugal purchased are, according Infarmed, following: 6.9 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine, 4.5 million Johnson &amp; Johnson, 4.5 million Pfizer, 4/5 million CureVac, 1.8 million Moderna number doses determine Sanofi-GSK vaccine.""

Source: now... Oregon public actually knows better thought

Dude... nah. there's one thing that's CRYSTAL fucking clear past year, public know better thought. Worse, actually. turns Texas gets away nothing terrible happens next couple months limbo widespread immunity, would tantamount broken clock right twice day (and even then, really, since couple friends Texas told stuff even close normal there, people still observing restrictions). Studies starting show otherwise. Vaccines drastically reduce transmission. Cool story, bro. 

While seem care exemplify selfish behavior, still wish well hope best health future. Despite ok possibly killing people. think better way handle open everything keep mask mandate...for now. Possibly.

It bad would least say stop undermining confidence vaccine. already uptick vaccine no-shows last couple days. Working it.. know rule bigotry, right?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thats 99,9998% chance getting clotting. br enough evidence, vaccine cause this. was, would talk 1 1000 higher chance, 1 million. literally every single regulatory agency made determion far said, vaccine perfectly safe zero reason conclude vaccine anything blood clots.

Now maybe read quoted emphasizes known whether vaccine anything blood clots. **But saying definitely have**, says.

Little zero reason, hence suspended precaution. probably expecting lots countries pause programs demand statement them. brother found shot pharmacy searches. also lives York County. 

I know Pennsylvania directing Janssen vaccines used educators. task done, flow general population. grandparents able get soon. able get first dose (Pfizer) weeks back due backup list (mostly clinic volunteer families). told we’d sure second jab lined up. Found yesterday I’ll need cross fingers hope nurse consistently squeeze extra doses administrator didn’t account “extra” people. 

Happy it, goddamn dumb scenario. trying civil discussion whole pre-existing conditions thins handled obviously ability communicate poor. example, drug addicts alcoholics vaccinated first health worse due ingest? drug addicts control it’s disease could treated like diabetics need help disease choosing. I’m trying discussion considered ‘pre-existing condition puts someone risk’ morality fat. older person someone heart condition, autoimmune disease, etc obese person, former smoker, drug addict. wish could explain eloquently maybe someone else weigh This, what's cited background levels CVST pre-covid incidence rates. Researchers also observed increase Thrombocytopenia, inc heparin induced, related covid

There seems big uptick Hematologic autoimmune disorders course, following COVID-19 well various inflammatory conditions 

Arguably we're really putting things microscope pandemic, clinical reports studies coming record pace also clear despite many unknowns tentative plausible biological explanations proposed uptick thrombotic events noticed mid pandemic. 

A country like Norway ~640 covid deaths overall likely going observed smaller proportion incidences vs somewhere like US experienced hundreds thousands covid related deaths many many cases overall- therefore they're going inclined consider unprecedented rare relatively COVID-19 infection increases thrombo-embolic risk significantly, vaccination prevents this. one Member States, EMA Commission. Countries decided follow Norway Denmark reports countries. equivalent almost half entire EU population. That’s HUGE. suspending vaccine causing deaths (and indeed blood clotting directly COVID-19) saves. 

I'm also angry decision countries making. time inevitably reverse decision potentially costs thousands lives could otherwise prevented. Thank you. informative. mean strongly recommended “not” vaccinated AZ? know they'd press conference say they've saying statements along. Best case scenario actually finished investigation already get back giving AZ. Sadly lived UK 80s-90s. got J&amp;J Sunday. Monday started feel sore muscles mostly upper thighs around abdomen around lunchtime. dinner time felt weak, low grade fever. never got headache. took Tylenol took edge big time.

Last night tired dog bed time conked right out, reason woke good 2 hours first alarm clock couldn’t get back sleep.

Today morning feel fine, soreness side effect. thing feel tired sleeping through. hope Norway continues ban everything may may risk. Many states much larger 65+ population might still vaccinating group. another state could finished smaller population sooner moved onto next group. Lol!!! Janssen make good 20 million doses end March, along projected allocations Pfizer Moderna, NY far off. 
I know projected allocations look like, though. moron Monday's case count seems little high... hope anomaly like last Monday. taking vaccine 😊 Presumably UK could vaccinate entire population zero issues... could still problem batch produced another site never made UK right? 

Not saying case, manufacturing process...things go wrong specific location, see effect averaged across manufacturing sites. course, easy guideline have. real way measure body fat home, either. political reason then? never said suspensions recommended agencies countries suspended omfg. Read comment again. God, people sub... 

""Patently false!"" 😂😂😂 Russian data reliable. review idea selective even real. standing manufacturing capacity make either. They're *promising* doses left right one them. Won’t people die Covid suspension? makes sense whatsoever. HAGUE — AstraZeneca subcontractor Halix sent Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine doses U.K. EU implemented export controls, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said January, Commission introduced new export controls requiring companies get authorization national authorities export vaccines outside bloc.

We received basically AZ vaccine prior January - hundred thousand doses. correct put caused, put recorded.

But change point, EU going pause roll Pfizer vaccine related 15% cases, bullshit? ""But EU member states legally free go way vaccinations wanted to""

Well yes actually no. They've coming back. We've people walking store completely sans-mask, remind mandate place, respond: 'you still that'? think likely say suspend (like they've saying) report ready we'll see. thrilled vaccines have,” said Swaminathan, Indian pediatrician best known research tuberculosis HIV. “we improve further,” said. “I think, well 2022, we’re going see emergence improved vaccines.” Doubt it, since variant testing isn’t widespread. J&amp;J one shot though. equivalent 150M AZ Moderna. actually quite lot, enough cover almost fifth EU's adult population. expected would support it. thought perception AZ vaccine low there.

Yes perception AZ low still 110k AZ vaccines inoculated day among highest risk groups. AZ offered everyone 18, limited supply AZ vanished weeks.

Well among oldest group, deaths plummeted vaccines. decision stopping AZ heavily criticized now. One trusted newspaper 'Die Zeit' headline today 'What stopping vaccination endangers lives protects?'. Overall benefits way higher risks. agree cases need investigated. really hope resume vaccinating soon, every day counts. politize precautionary suspension make sound like recommendation medical agencies. suspension recommendation Legemiddelverket Norway Sundhedsstyrelsen Denmark. may read decision totally correct. irrelevant head Italy's medical regulator said political medical. actually met today originally scheduled press release Pfizer vaccine authorized 16 over. Russian accounts, mean, right? Nah. I'm advocating vaccine produced country tossing doctors windows last year. That's ridiculous. marathons attended refunded deferred free. would think prestigious marathon world would give deferral unprecedented pandemic mention it’s second time it’s delayed/cancelled EVER. Even money spent leftover. know, can’t even qualify damn thing yet Pfizer deliveries Sweden steady increasing. decrease last month. AZ  think idiots want government's focus primarily tax-payers? directed much society whole. want end this? way that. people see that. want dose. I'm world every day. hear straight horse's mouths. People want normal summer? Prioritize people give us that, cover asses. self appointed bot expert, think they're russian.
Looks similar bots showed US primaries trash talk universal healthcare promote Gilead drug supposed silver bullet covid. many vaccinated serious issues Covid get vaccine. number compared clot reports overall number. give sense risk vs reward. Halix plant Netherlands, approved EU yet, part UK supply chain, also exported UK beginning roll out. plant produces drug-substance. schedule eating juice cookies, call except remind you. Sputnik V seems excellent vaccine accounts. Personally care vaccine comes long safe effective. get voicemails blocked numbers? mean, extremely obvious vaccines causing deaths.

Would heartbeat. Well came surprise me. posted another thread, hard believe first-world countries like Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France independence health regulators like UK does.

Maybe Italy, that's case, fact case ""our gov't pressured us follow others, even though disagree"". still doubt that's true countries started/followed it...

Or maybe he's saying anti-AstraZeneca sentiment Italy fall (once resumed)? saying patently false

😂😂😂 exactly say found patently false? Unlike UK Israel, Europe big rely one manufacturer.

The US gambled Pfizer Moderna, delivering according schedule.

The EU gambled Pfizer AstraZeneca, AZ unmitigated disaster. Delivering tiny fraction promised, lying factories, lying deliveries, submitting approval weeks UK, etc. Brexiteers blame EU investing AZ, looking like AZ wildly overpromised claimed everything would peachy time cough vaccines.

To make matters worse, EU weighted AZ heavily Pfizer several (Eastern Bloc) nations handle cold chain needed roll Pfizer far promising vaccine 2020.

So EU went best candidate ...got screwed essentially, leaving us 30% vaccines expecting now. Pre-covid traveled India month work. always heart attack team would give estimate 1 Lakh written out... tiny little brain saw 1 comma immediately read 1 Million dollars (like Dr. Evil). 

Took trips get handle this. :) Herd immunity would switch homogeneous population. pockets people don’t herd immunity problem. like see outbreaks certain demographics America diseases vaccination rate high enough grant herd immunity. understand abundance caution tends happen things can't help feel woeful mistake.

Most likely jab reapproved fairly shortly public confidence takeup taken hit based concrete evidence. Lives lost decision seem proportionate risk.

After bungling much UK look forward pretty normal summer, still seems distant dream EU countries. Quick, let's ban AZ jab! Germany's vaccination rate?  think get basic superpowers like invisibility xray vision. Tea, Earl grey, hot. mean? general population poor grasp statistics critical thinking Germany started finally open 4 months nothing + offered free tests everyone least week. numbers growing. shocking... 


/s fml Hopefully people question infected we'll find soon. can't imagine hospital day age run Covid test part standard procedure anyone hospitalized strange circumstances. We've 28 reported blood clots. 13 AZ, 15 Pfizer, 24,000,000 first doses. know trust anything produced Russia point. Propaganda conspiracy theory easily create future, people go away. Nevermind death rates diseases anywhere near 100%. fast end.

That's kind comforting No, antibodies part reactive immune system. shit. basic process exponentially growing shrinking fundamental laws reality.

Sometimes, looks bit different, that's geographical superposition, testing inaccuracies eyes playing tricks us near R=1, kinds exponential change would cancel other. things, batch test, one person hiv cause lots blood thrown out. 

The risk catching HIV unprotected sex woman extremely low. kicked ass, like hour 20-28. Would day feel safer. woman make sure take iron week two beforehand hematocrit high enough donate. 12 can't donate. months, basically everyone wants vaccine received one. I'm sure really much reason care point. specifically useful papers combating COVID-19 conspiracies misinformation? Stupid stuff like 'derr causal link virus disease,' 'anything cause respiratory issues.' 

I recent AstraZeneca issues recent &amp; topical - good interlocutor convinced deliberately causes thrombosis, papers I'd already looking published recently. 

But otherwise read things months ago hard time digging papers back (I know one went great depth it, another discussed spike protein depth, another looked specific parts genome), partly intuitively know terminology field. 

Basically, struggling find papers google scholar etc. information want. field. mostly rebutting arguments common sense, frankly helping, leaping towards increasingly schizophrenic takes every conversation. see making logical leaps trying force consistency completely unrelated pieces 'evidence' justify batshit narrative. Yes would never describe friend impulsive sociopath sociopathic traits. That’s point. Pfizer-Biontech sending vaccine Canada UK almost completely stopped deliveries weeks Try driving Canada see happens. CBSA send back. US able get 70% end June, earlier. idea Canada. 6 months seem crazy all. Make digital like Israel, ezpz Missed obvious joke we? people getting vaccinated now, part phase 3 trial testing? Since document mentions trial period 24/26 months long. wife got second shots Pfizer Sunday afternoon. day Monday mess... chills, aches, pains, small fever, stayed bed day, etc. fine nothing sore arm slightly achy back could vaccine related 20 miles hiked weekend poorly fitted backpack. night second shot vivid dream crashing F1 car weird since rarely remember dreams I'm fan F1 racing.

We continue mask follow established protocols state county. subsection 'experts' start advising stuff blatantly public interest publically available data, experts literally saying opposite, seem unreasonable start asking questions whether perhaps agenda? actually not, incidence cerebral thromboembolisms present general population people vaccinated Pfizer vaccine UK. decision suspend use justifiable. Wanna investigate cases? Go ahead, suspending rollout vaccine absolutely justified. Vaccination passports thing untill vaccination open **for all** least couple weeks. Anything else disgrace initial trial data EMA reviewed approval showed efficacy 59-60%. Maybe hot minute. within handful months everything goes well Canadian American populations less completely vaccinated, virus basically completely gone, little reason worry someone one holdouts want get vaccinated. Impulsivity truly considered Sociopathic trait. Also risk-taking considered psychopathic treat. Yeah look long took us get going steady rate notice 500,000 people died COVID-19. think 90% generating antibody response Heat doesnt denature prion? always political decision politicians listening experts know anything this. 

From layman's perspective experts seem scared unknown here. 

Also something consider: Germany 3 teenagers died Covid, 48 people 20s 117 people 30s. couple young people dying vaccine suddenly insignificant consider deaths alone. rare year. Covid actually caused disease. far likely people got vaccine also suffering virus virus caused happening? thought Pfizer increased production Europe bioNTech opened new plant? due AZ? (Reuters) - Roche launching SARS-CoV-2 variant test help monitor emerging coronavirus mutations, Swiss pharmaceuticals group said Tuesday. test runs widely used high-throughput systems research purposes only. “Periodic assessments emerging variants shown Roche’s current diagnostic tests detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infections remain accurate effective,” said. see reference Pfizer cases? far know, mostly older, frail people, unlike AZ cases. America vaccinating Would agree fact type clotting observed (multiple clots, low platelets, looks like DIC) number events statistically signficant deviations normal ?

&amp;#x200B;

There reason suspect causation exactly evaluation. unscientific approach ? USA yes. foreign nationals enter Canada. introduced west arab merchants

not particularly related comment, thought neat clinical confirmation yet even SVT

PEI report suggests accumulation special form rare CVT/SVT associated deficiency platelets bleeding. mentioned last paragraph, rare conditions detected rarely UK's data trial data PEI said. That's needs investigated there's fact direct link vaccines cases according PEI.

There's huge criticism media PEI's decision Germany. independent institute advises politicians. say needs investigated resuming vaccinating again, politicians listen. Opposite would political decision even though would saved lives. want USA ship az Canada Mexico. Doubtful use them

'Doubtful' mean 'certain'. hold onto really clear use them. agree. Public schools sometimes 45 kids classroom. Six feet apart would impossible. Okay answer this.

Pfizer reported 25 cases blood clotting 10 million vaccinations (2.5 per million)

AZ reported 28 cases blood clotting 11 million vaccinations. (2.54 per million)

Why havent countries also suspended Pfizer vaccine? clearly political decision. someone elaborate that? mean might political countries like Italy France everything corrupt fucked whole vaccination program, miss bullshit countries like Norway Denmark suspending political reasons. Norway even part EU buying vaccines own. Norway suspended AZ they've got 6 cases young healthy people coming rare clot disorder (2 dead) last 4 days commonality AZ vaccine. rare clot disorder 1 case per month type population. chief physician treating patients says never seen anything like before

They suspending political reasons. suspending 2 people 30's died combination brain clot, bleeding low blood palatels Norway there's several cases countries clinical picture. german institutet also noticed several cases rare blood disorder immediately suspended it. scientifical level headed approach temporarily suspend investigate meanwhile EU contract novavax yet much due Russian cyberbots bad mouthing AstraZeneca easily sell Europe Sputnik V?!

None friends issues Pfizer vaccine. Hell, old duck nursing home Australia accidentally received like 10x proper Pfizer dose completely fine.

Jab Pfizer til' cows come home, keep Oxford shit away. Brazil certainly better countries.

There evidence causation true, isnt dumb do? mean yeah, fda good like wouldnt want confirm fda findings giving drugs people?  Sounds like problem healthcare system, actual products. look data vast majority infected fully vaccinated. compare vaccinated population Israel vaccinated see huge difference. 

Don't know happened florida possible many immunity getting infected? *any* statistical evidence it’s linked clots? Anything that's 1-in-a-million chance happen 8000 times every person earth tests chance, 350 times 350 million people. Even 1-in-a-billion chances happen 8 times average. I'm surprised could've happened. Nah, kind like idea keeping Canadians Canada. Ah yea, pharmaceutical industry market cornered. Meanwhile healthcare costs keep rising 6 10 Americans live least one chronic disease. Great track recorded shilling for.  3 feet might well distancing. people think 6 feet 3. else take blame bad atmosphere. lower number expected deliveries weekly basis. screwed phase III trial. unreliable suppliers, product even investigation causing deadly side effects. Forgive us bit wary AZ right now. completely irrational suggest Covid thing taken consideration discussing public policy. number doses delivered administered pretty consistently \~2 weeks deliveries. 

This suggests administration keeping supply, bit lag. try show precedent EU making bad/political based decisions vaccination process agree. indicate numbers. Yes, clumpiness makes even less likely caused vaccine. 

You vaccine administered tens millions across world, events clumping together single area. much statistically unlikely spread across world. recommend website. automatically crawls websites open appointments. used get spot Missouri since opened new tier. seems like could bad news. looks they're getting roughly proportion states, either they're bothering vulnerable populations (and bit worry about) large vaccine denial they're running people willing take it. “No, phone does” supposed 240 million doses delivered April 1

There's bit weasel-wording here. Drug companies said they'll 240M doses available CDC April 1. CDC tracker shows doses states reported delivered. There's probably 1-2 week lag drug company notifying CDC available doses, states reporting CDC doses delivered. - Tests: 1,242,571 - Cases: 46,776 - Deaths: 620 - Currently Hospitalized: 36,282 - Currently ICU: 7,250 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: states didn’t report yesterday getting multiple days data. Hopefully better days week goes on. Keep getting shots meantime. feel like stems fear needles.

Vaccines? Get fucked. 

Oxys? Sure, give here. exercise without mask I’ve also vaccinated didn’t go gym prior Rural areas enforcing masks part anyways  vaccinations also generally ramping up, state open vaccine eligibility million people today. yesterday logged 360,000 vaccinations per la times, next week could see either plateau due reopenings could see continued improvement anyone know CDC stopped reporting hospitalizations? might able find data now?

I feel like it’s #1 indicator current state pandemic can’t see direct data days ago. San Diego way ahead counties terms vaccine distribution, probably they've taken step*. must confident enough supply keep demand. 

Why spinning bad thing beyond me.

*They've extended eligibility pre-existing conditions also transportation workers (including airlines), homeless incarcerated people. 30 percent seems like pretty big discrepancy though. get they're really good preventing severe illness really want covid form. also get trials done different conditions strains 66 percent versus 95 percent make feel great J&amp;J  makes feel better, true - main supplier EU Pfizer long shot. Even Janssen provide doses AZ. go 24 hour fitness. Also stores restaurants lower income neighborhoods mask policies though really enforcing anyways. May well ship AZ vaccine EU now, one going want Big talk continent hordes worlds Giraffes  37.98M doses present, ÷ 2 = 18.99M people totally vaccinated. Total children antivaxxers removed 47.99M, 47.99M - 18.99M = 29M. Target date reopening 06/21, 14 weeks away meaning UK would hit 4.14M per week average then.

If truly achieve 5M vaccinations per week average (as they're shooting now), 12 weeks doses. course, it'll take time build that's probably maximum, may see like 3.5-4M couple spikes 5M  times live in. Hyper nationalism making ugly comeback. clotting incidents different. occurring much rarer form accompanied low platelet count, locations don’t make sense young people. reasons concerned. could totally nothing, bears investigation.

Sounds like you’re anti-science name defending AZ. shows world taking vaccine safety seriously - like that. look total population 55.9% received atleast 1 shot, 46.06% received shots.

The virus still dying though. 7.6% positive test rate 1 month ago 2.4% yesterday thats 68% decrease positive test rate 1 month.

that almost everything open now, restaurants bars packed, gyms open without mask requirement(and 99% people dont wear mask there), clubs opening next week. Like recommended using over-65s? certainly explains early pandemic behavior, like problems happening appear little beurocracy issues time. 

Instead report(thanks way) appears really comes fact companies prioritizing countries paid screwing EU. difference 10 days US EU getting deal big rollout going terribly prior capitalist BS. 

I find really frustrating insulting vaccine makers deliberately working closely regulators EU like US. 

There's also element EU actually charge rollout result poorer countries obviously limited do, guess would probably happened regardless EU not. believe UK figure 71%, actually reported here. Depends greatly Alaska you’re talking about. Anchorage bowl lags vaccines protective measures (I’m counting Valley Trash Anchorage Bowl), that’s cases are. Juneau people wearing masks, vaccines rapidly stuck arms (we’re getting 500 doses day arms, 7 days week, 35,000 people here), case counts low seem staying there.  AstraZeneca ones developed vaccine wold profit beginning. given 'oven ready' vaccine UK Gov Oxford Uni, turn deliver 100 mln doses UK form UK based production chain priority, AZ vaccine allowed exported UK hit target. AZ profit 'only' 20% margin, cover costs eg amortization expensive equipment, necessary investments. normal circumstitions I'd say 20% profit bad deal. all. 

The though, AZ given vaccine, probably taken away hit 100 mln dozes certain timeframe. &lt;- that's noevidence based speculations. staff prisons bring in? think EMA decided wage war EU instead? Yes. CDC's webpage Moderna vaccines:

In arm got shot:

* Swelling

Throughout rest body:

* Tiredness
* Headache
* Muscle pain
* Chills
* Fever
* Nausea

""These side effects usually start within day two getting vaccine. Side effects might affect ability daily activities, go away days.""

If headache persists much longer, might want contact doctor get opinion. Hope feel better soon! guys keep trying shoehorn position defending every European decision lmao.

For fucks sake, I’m defending actions, suspension investigation makes sense since clotting incidents rare severe statistically significant.  apples apples Well, youtube privately owned corporation could sued helping spread misinformation lies. like banning donny lying twitter, they're companies covering asses. asked simple question.

What you, twelve?  need prisons. dangerous fucking people need locked away and, yes, it’s job someone do. agree completely. Note: original Dutch term negative connotation, English translation does.

It seems site changed headline anyway. I'm hour border would kill day trip Montreal, especially since even left state since 2019 (I grad school busy go anywhere!) I'm fully vaccinated getting antsier day, I'm certainly still willing wait safe be. Fingers crossed summer countries lot better travel okay again! vaccine standby list stressful, everyday 8-9PM, sit waiting hoping get call, still gotten call yet. anti vaxers afraid covid-19. media hype them. Take number people current eligibility group divide number doses per month figure many months couple cases pfizer along way less sude effects overall seems. Plus people forget even don’t die blood clots could still cause post-thrombotic syndrome could well affect quite people (obviously goes everything don’t know longterm conplications like corona mrna vaccines) I’d give az people corona risk group everyone else seems rubbish Canada’s vaccine rollout pretty slow tbh thats said ""pretty much example want throw there"" replace florida texas whichever state thought handling poorly. end day pandemic shouldnt left states handle things, feds job public actually knows better thought

Come now...we agree lot things, that's painful. Plenty people 'the public' predicting end pandemic every month since March 2020. think person gets wrong 12 times declare successful get right next time. Yeah you. painfully aware people states view governance - kinda point.

IMO addicted liberties can't see nose face. sure would self immolate live (australia).

But one us sitting mountain dead fellow citizens. think history kind point view.

Best luck! Make sure give back tax dollars hoover California New York feel strongly it! live LA County got appointment today tomorrow using Carbon Health. time (11:00am) ton new appointments tomorrow. afraid blood clots COVID?

Probably not. well, fact major institutions kept mask mandates commenting evidence. someone get infected going spread. works well expensive one. Keep moving arm much possible - it'll help mitigate soreness. Grats vaccine! :) Firstly, EMA recommended provisionally keep vaccinating actually announced review previous results planning meet emergency meeting Thursday light new findings Germany. 

Secondly, data public. Thirdly, government (and say someone who's outspoken critic voted it) charge least populist simultaneously pro-vaxx parties Germany (which good thing, course). 

Fourth, 2011 actually bad example. worked Roche time, everybody knew failure get-go. basically scammed people governments giant contracts. 

Indeed, unlike crazed anti-vaxxers said, caused harm. almost completely useless German government alone wasted billions Euros Tamiflu co. 

This fact single worst example one could picked besides Contergan 60s. Florida's bad? Yeah called local places said don’t them. One place even said didn’t know they’d get Canada currently distributing purchased India order 20 million AZ states clear US let cross border time soon. US, 'Central Europe' thing mainly context WW1  sounds correct top line combination specific type clot, are, demographics getting enough raise eyebrows.  Well talking American public Yup think one. 

Either way curious report investigation say. 3 Norwegian Healthcare worker definitely intriguing one versus cases european countries. Paywall. Meditation stretching helps Since there's many bad comments here:

a. healthcare workers special group get lot exposure virus people. immune system react accordingly.

b. studies suggested proven vaccine immunity last much longer natural immunity. study long term one.

c. data phase 3 trials vaccines shown evoke much greater immune system response antibody levels natural immunity.

d. study account variants.  Here:

When happen? recently started strict requirements hotel stay, multiple tests, etc. good point - number people around strongly affects risk. government indeed fucked up, even voted Bolsonaro want out.

But take 6 months completely clear symptoms mononucleosis. That’s heck disease. Fauci needs retire , chill , go back home whatever needs stfu. I’m expert , It’s obvious moron subject like thar Europe surge due vaccine supply. Fauci keep saying it’s due opening soon? except isn't. Pfizer similar rate clotting incidents, yet AZ called it?

Sounds like salty EU trying find scapegoat horrendous vaccine deployment me. hey got wish! No, despite headline, vaccines far effective. [They publicly accessible publicly available information AstraZeneca vaccine lists total 35 cases thrombocytopenia reported “Yellow Cards” UK 8th March 2021. small proportion yellow card reports total 54,000 context nearly 10 million vaccinations delivered. Pfizer vaccine total 22 reports thrombocytopenia 33,000 reports well 10 million vaccination doses. clear proportion reports bleeding disorder different two vaccines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think one reason people EU set look channel coming weeks, see 80% adults vaccinated lockdown lifted, whilst faced third wave rising cases &amp; deaths.

That's going lead huge questions EU possibly angry scenes sort happened recently Holland.

The EU need scapegoat, setting AZ it, know AZ is, majority UK. 

They either hold hands (the EU) say, ""look fucked whole thing caused deaths loved ones"" blame Brits, one would bet on? Oxford vaccine savaged American press since trial results announced. expect another cost vaccine another pandemic. CDC extremely conservative urges people avoid risks. get AZ horrible, worst I've felt years. good though. Sorry one death many regardless circumstances.
 
This insane take. baseline mortality 1 million see 1 death vaccinated population million, stop vaccinations different baseline. That's exactly what's happening here:
 EMA also said data available far showed number blood clots vaccinated people higher seen among general population. signed first dose morning already 1:55 afternoon. Pfizer. remember you’re scared, it’s irrational. anxiety know it’s going okay. Lyme disease caused bacteria. takes we're fucked lol written lawyer obviously. easily edit data, yea. percentage highest risk groups vaccine. strain hospitals lower, overall numbers probably look lower people arnent vaccinated group probably wont even bother get tested (ie younger, healthier, case likely mild.) think size might come play, I've tried power red 3 times effect! Regular donations get up, cookie OJ continue day like nothing happened! 38 30.4 It’s political decision. data backing safety vaccine doesn’t mean anything large portion people don’t trust source. It’s going challenging convince large minority population get vaccinated. Little decisions like help. may cost lives whether save lives equally important making public policy. think studies people got pregnant. pretty sure read somewhere. Young people usually worse reactions vaccine old people. necessarily think dumb. understand Fauci's caution. want dial everything back 10 virus still killing thousands. 

On hand. home state 2 deaths trending down. figure deaths due COVID caught 2 weeks ago. 

We Europe. We've given 100 million vaccinations. difficult question. Vaccines aren’t made billionaires, they’re made people billionaires hire give resources make them. reason state cannot hire people give resources make them. altruism involved, greed involved, concrete question chosen allocate resources structure production society. According sub dead pretty soon blood clot NM large percentage population Native get allotment vaccine federal government. distribution vaccines managed well. also ND, SD AK high percentage adults vaccinated already. Because: misinformation lies? Nothing like constantly attacking one cost vaccine countries it? wonder managed without pretending working class parent somehow immune COVID 8 hour workday sacrosanct never changed. believe they’ve got plumbers electricians New Zealand too. Somehow managed defeat COVID.

And wasn’t nationwide pod system implemented immediately? Maybe always considered poor working class adults essentially disposable? (What happens plumber gets COVID can’t work? care children then?) Dumb question: guy successfully knocked getting mRNA vaccine? (Would love examples show family) Depends pharmacy fast update. proactive others.

When went 60 50yo, friend mine (59) scheduled eligibility date putting incorrect birth year. moral dilema schedule date eligible legally. 

Remember, need eligible day GET shot, day SCHEDULE shot. helps seems like 65% get shot Go Italy! Tell is, European people deserve vaccinated want **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.

Real world data thus far certainly seems suggesting aren’t yet necessary. 

I think it’s important understand awesome benefits get pharma - like remarkably effective vaccines year. it’s also really important remember corporations driven profit, hyping variants understand implications great way keep one biggest windfalls they’ve experienced going longer. said EMA evaluation individual incidents ongoing. expected complete full review on Thursday.

FFS people!!!

Sure - referred *syndrome*.

The show focuses much characters. lot bridge crew practically glorified extras.

95% problems solved Michael, gets boring. again, show needs give time characters.

The jump future means we’re familiar worlds people involved story. stakes feel lower planet danger we’ve never heard of.

Some acting little campy, even standards Star Trek. acting fine, definitely moments made laugh supposed serious.

There good things.

I like Kelpians world building happened them.

The four main characters (Burnham, Tilly, Stammets, Saru) good chemistry.

The mirror universe stuff kinda cool. know it’s well established since original series, really delved way haven’t before. Seeing much interesting.

There good parts. whole, think underwhelming addition franchise. Politics also money. coincidence vaccine subject smears non-profit one.  guess didn’t understand, lol surprise surprise Interesting - I've opposite experience! I'm 6'5"" 240ish male get woozy normal donation never problem power red (I've done least 10 times). bad part wait longer donations power red. bad feeling states drag restrictions much longer necessary. hope I'm wrong. thing committees even seen data yet. new vaccine (emergency) approved months ago. unusual find rare side effects months later. Check 2009 Swine Flu vaccine Pandemrix caused narcolepsy rare cases completely missed medical trials [found years several European countries noticed studied it.

Now AstraZeneca, cases thrombosis reported previously vaccines statistically significant. committees talk about. new cases thrombosis different. ones reported Denmark Norway ""extremely unusual symptoms"" [ones showed ""striking accumulation special form rare cerebral vein thrombosis (sinus vein thrombosis) connection deficiency blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) bleeding"" extremely rare, especially young people, yet there's already 7 cases reported people took vaccine. yes, valid reason least investigate this.

You also keep mind skepticism vaccinations unfortunately [much higher many European compared UK (especially AstraZeneca), there's good reason sweep anything rug due diligence. EU politician anything gain deliberately slowing vaccinations, people already furious slow rollout. health ministers made clear vaccinations continue immediately investigated. 1. Stating fact Arabs (not Muslims, Arabs) Israel significantly antivaxx sentiment Jews anti Muslim.
2. started Israel blocks Israeli Arabs accessing vaccine, that's false.
3. thought cases Israel among Arabs, that's also false, among Jews. Lol experience hard really pretty dry reminiscent astronaut ice cream stop process, try save blood possible would good specific example difference handling procedure, yes, logically possible one.

If UK handling/storing vaccine X days administration, Germany X+Y days, absolutely could triggering sort unrecognized ""expiration date"".

Do know whether countries, Norway India, example typically handling/storing longer periods time UK?

Of note: AZ vaccine, like Pfizer Moderna vaccines, contain preservative prolong shelf life. I’ve seen positive reports vaccine r/covidlonghaulers. Unfortunately, also people didn’t seem help. mean stocked?   ten population must ecstatic  Thank :) feel much better reading responses! harm caused depriving people access vaccine likely vastly outweigh even worst case scenario link clotting disorders eventually found

I think big takeaway article. Even fears turn foundations, still wrong move. Let’s see things go Thursday next week. feeling pause impact public’s desire get vaccinated. 

I agree EU screwed vaccine strategy attacking AZ (some times fairly so, times much), UK US cover mistakes. don’t see intentionally making public want vaccines already paid stock, best interests. remind Trump vaccinated January. official ? Nothing see start back campaign ? 

In end, *much ado nothing* vaccination campaign stopped yesterday restart today. analysis going fast, seems like proper reaction literally called Michigan thread. Though thought we’d go April 4th, day earlier. Guess cancel road trip now.  Anyone else get J&amp;J pretty bad response it? I’m 3 days wow I’m exhausted. felt great day got it, night fever, chills, aches, nauseous. next day fever broke still felt pretty terrible, day 3 feel absolutely wiped fortunately achey. I’m young healthy far doctor tells (apart condition prompted want vaccinated bearing immune system) pretty surprised bad reaction it? Next time Oxford whatever academic institution forced sell vaccines profit. Michigander, believe it. think go nearest T-mobile didn’t say clots aren’t dangerous - fact, said opposite, I’m surprised hold ignorant view point. trying prove conspiracy theorists right? major retailers wait date eligible schedule appointment lmao New Jersey increased income taxes making $1 million per year. gonna shed tear folks.

If mean property taxes... like going Christie. That's it! That's fine then. They're recommending paused investigation going, contrary point made. US UK call bluff announcing they'll happily buy every single dose AZ vaccine country suspends shots. Let Brits Americans Italians dumb actually use them. Really?. know vaccine safe effective ""on children""? whole point trial. think demand still exceeds supply areas. Cleveland getting mass vaccination site running, churning burning soon. think ton excess supply- larger cities, least. suburbs got much larger initial supplies based population... areas excess sooner. I’m assuming boosters fall. wonder got Pfizer vaccine first could get Moderna booster combo. bet next monday they'll appointments 29th later. select whatever criteria want schedule long meet official criteria appointment day. Probably not, since still chance people severe outcome gives virus chances mutate. Plus someone getting sick costs money, healthcare, lack production, staying home helping economy etc.

And like 2 3 months away getting everyone wants one vaccinated. 

That mean need lockdown still careful (wear masks, social distance, etc.) I'm saying wrong think look higher percentage. make vaccine hesitant people get it. state wide open incentive get vaccine hesitant? opinion. people going want wear masks summer even mandated, compliance crater. Two points here. 1) Heparin harmless. 2) would even consider prophylaxis claim AZ vaccine causes blood clots unfounded? knee-jerk reaction something completely unsubstantiated data. hope right. Honestly I'm concerned could go completely rails way disinformation utilized current age.

Here's hoping goes well. Traffic Toronto maybe 5-10% lower normal times tbh.  I'm surprised really, pretty sure opened mass vaccination sites would pretty quickly open things up. really bet 40+ everyone else week later overwhelm system. assume supply open everyone starting next week. better lock twice hard! individual states cant get anything done efficiently 2020 proved. end getting letting governors control things florida texas pretty much example want throw EMA urged keep vaccinating.

Whatever governments either done non-public data follow populism no-vax sentiment, like 2011. one competent country South America seems az stock pile like 20-30 million. follow Swedish media quite closely, honestly think they've duty challenging questioning authorities extent should, feel sorry you.

If case, clearly know well functioning press looks like.

Kinda sad. Know else clumpy? Non-random events.  Moderna 4 weeks, sometimes Pfizer 4 weeks scheduling purposes (like know using day.)

Otherwise 3 welcome, yes incredibly sad, certainly warrants investigating, 

by way user thread posted norweigan article think refer to. indeed worded less ideally could easily source initial confusion, helpfully though confirm originally different venues think you’re right. mistake. already confirmed caused vaccine.

Utter nonsense. bet 90% confirmed fault vaccine, instead inconclusive proven caused by, completely different standard. Would apt saying situation, one one many one bad apple spoils bunch? china already trying win nations vaccine dipolmacy, wonder usa considering sending some. Applebee's primarily United States? think Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, United States. **None Europe.** again, what? selfish want vaccinate especially since influential. like buying vaccines hoarding giant pile. producing making own. can't mad especially since know 100% problem roles reversed. 

And call government fuckes up, said messed Covid vaccine response scared won’t say it! We're slowly lifting restrictions increments, we've already returned kids schools, opened gyms, bars, restaurants. Allow sports events concerts 500 people weddings 300. cases *still* dropping.

Outdoor masks removes less risk lot restrictions we've already lifted, makes sense remove too, priority.

85% 16+ population either vaccinated recovered. We're running eligible willing people vaccinate, end game, there's little wait couple months (getting protection rate 16+ gong huge game changer). referred EU monolithic entity - mean, specifically, major powers EU particularly big fans UK right now, actively involved bunch diplomatic messes (mainly fault UK came mind) should’ve allocated individual states, federal govt. can’t get anything done efficiently imo. tired faulty “.. Palestinians terrorists!” argument. lame. Maybe sky falling public actually knows better thought. think talking people able leave job get shot. let 20 30 year old carry usual quarantine old, obese people. -If someone dies contracting COVID-19, regardless cause death, COVID-19 death.

-If someone dies getting vaccine, regardless cause death, unrelated vaccine.

Makes sense. potential clots AZ

But point, anything abnormal amount clots sized sample people. don’t understand reasoning behind rule honestly (the results around globe, shouldn’t they?) seems saved time least saving time see went countries. Thanks info anyway Seems private gatherings would bigger worry. r without significant social restrictions? Wearing mask prevents contracting spreading virus. 

Wearing mask flu season would help prevent contracting flu also prevent spreading symptoms mild didn’t know sick.

So thanks agreeing point. 90% already vaccinated. else remains disease ""well handled""? Good point! hear ya. It’s good folks bring balance discussion here. Thanks! Important keep mind thats strictly infection. They’re almost 100% effective death hospitalization og covid variants  mind vaccine me, prefer everybody else really needs it. Like poor, know, US like poor. wont change mind calling country fucked up, Accept fact think selfish bullshit country STILL DOING. trying swerve one way another impact suspension, blame even anything happens. Also, fuck wrong you? understanding suggesting three healthcare workers admitted *to* OUS, rather originally *from* OUS (and pointed article clarifies different health trusts"") 

you're right, opening sentence clear easily give wrong impression .I think must source original confusion!

Thanks link--Mystery solved! Unfortunately known cause cancer comes warning label. kids rapidly get COVID immunity reopen schools? Presumably Israel bother test/tracing schools spread like wildfire there. Counterpoint - US states drop restrictions country gets 50%, 50% never bother go back want anyway. Whats incentive? 5,000,000 people received AZ vaccination.

1:1000 people experience DVT per 52 week period(1 year).

Therefore could assume 5,000 vaccine recipients would experience DVT within year getting vaccine.

There 52 weeks year, assume consistent distribution, would expect roughly 96(5,000,000 / 1000 / 52) vaccinated people experience DVT week. Israel cautious. Instead lifting restrictions once, we're slowly two weeks intervals.

Masks never really big point Israel (unlike US), anti mask protests people get it, never priority. almost certainly need masks outdoors many people stopped wearing recently anyway afaik mandate really enforced. one cares we'll need wait another week two official decision. Logically opposite. fact quick halt small concerns increase confidence say safe safe.

Now groups always behave logically, think overall try ""game"" information give public make things want do, breed long term distrust, worse things end up. goal flatten curve, according you, fuck would go back normal afterwards?  never been, it’s data we’ve pandemic.

We know FL 4% cases hospitalized 2% die. (Hopefully) Feeling better today? *Lying.* virus arriving spreading. oversimplify incredible extent, imagine viral spread conditions normally 8/10. 10/10 Christmas normal year. we're 3/10, last Christmas 5/10.

No holiday necessary NYC disaster. Normal life enough, March month started getting tons imported cases abroad. built Feb-March. can't allow people get vaccinated suspect might something wrong vaccine. 

It sucks, yeah, problems linked vaccine, that's best choice now. can't jump darkness know safe place stand. can't allow people get vaccinated suspect might something wrong vaccine. 

It sucks, yeah, problems linked vaccine, that's best choice now. can't jump darkness know safe place stand. believe there's 17 million doses administered far, I'd thought anything missed trials would cropped now.

22 reported one source, 17 million (assuming AZ figures accurate), seems like anomaly, would trial caught that? 

Is nation reporting significant uptick blood clots can't explain? I'd like see source assertions. would determine immunity vaccine that's administered months lasts two years? Also aware NHS study shows natural immunity effective phizer vaccine? Scummy what? Wanting vaccinate ourselves? country fucked get mad prioritizing us government messed up. difficult situation complaing pointing finger everyone else help could change vaccination plans target immunity see results faster limited doses/capacity vaccinate. could change vaccination plans target immunity see results faster limited doses/capacity vaccinate. Hey, everyone entitled views beliefs. believe people's rights freedoms unparalleled importance ends justify means. believe taking away greater good safety and/or security important. you! would live SD heartbeat, caught dead living CA. Right would give government anyone matter right pick gets speak. 

To say there’s ill effects incorrect. don’t know you’ve heard particular vaccine that’s causing blood clots. Also deaths caused vaccine well. 

I’m saying they’re statistically significant say none whatsoever kinda wrong. mean source relatively straightforward: FDA requires trials conducted US FDA standards US approval. AZ study, submit vaccine US approval US study back claims. 

This sub getting furious US making exemption AZ, pointing UKs results. US circumvented normal procedures happened would hell pay. Oregon also prioritized teachers opening seniors. [a Friday, Kate Brown put vaccination rate 65+ 47%, whereas USA rate 65+ 64.1% today.

Apparently priority order caused bit hitch federal administration started pushing prioritizing teachers recently, resulting locations reserve certain days teachers, except teachers still needed appointments here. rush vaccine joe smoe rush back Applebee's hamburger yell minimum wage server get. 124,640 doses administered Canada, single-day record. False alarm not, think vaccines, 'cheap' one things think positive, use. helps show world scummy nation is. Oh yes, Im even talking ventilators crisis last year. Trvmp’s policy disastrous, sure thing, go vaccine? platform even use now, TikTok maybe? elections, literally pushing vaccine *his* administration victory, could imply anti-vaccine? dumb article. Also double tests per day (per capita - weekly averages).

If look hospitalization deaths we're far ahead US, less half daily deaths per capita (weekly average) US bad itself.

We looking lifting mast mandate, probably week two. Ach ja, wie das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut und das Robert-Koch-Institut? Wenn du dich besser auskennst, melde dich doch gerne bei denen, und bei Gelegenheit auch noch gerne bei den Iren und Dänen. 

Das mit der Suizidalität tut mir leid (tja, kann nicht wegen Corona passieren, wenn man wie ich schon vorher das Problem hatte :-/), aber diese Kommentare sind nicht hilfreich. 

Als ob Merkel das mit Scholz ausgewürfelt hätte oder sowas. plus teachers educators earmarked get 10% vaccines theyve vaccinating teachers Good catch safe side suspend Justin Trudeau immediately, best. Okay, thank you. read good thing dumb sometimes. Thanks link, new data coming looks interesting paper Lancet. complaining do? understand difficult situation blaming everything U.S help anybody Dr. Osterholm hates this. Australia least pretty much Covid free. urgent right now. Canada bought huge supply they're bit back line. vaccine effective previous infection, guess nobody safe world agree. think things going much normal months United States. know vaccine situation going Canada, though. Cases Texas [continuing go despite people clamoring restrictions clearly hoping. people nations coming South Korea; people who've already living South Korea even outbreak. feeling mrna like antibotics 21st century. place, living eye storm would same. know cause live first world country, everything easy. article says three people working come different ""helseforetak"". sentence misleading:

 ""Tre helsearbeidere ved Oslo universitetssykehus (OUS) er lagt inn med blodpropp, [meldte Aftenposten "" one time conservatives excited word liberal used. give vacc producers money like UK US able put money production capabilities profit. Unlike EU treated vaccines like Marrakesh rug bazaar haggled price causing death thousands untold billions economic damage extended lockdowns.  problem blood clots alone. problem multiple blood clots various parts body, time low count blood plates blood, internal bleeding random places. explained today news conference following latest fatality Norway, unusual healthy 30year olds.

There one greater good. People may die arent vaccinated time. Peoples trust vaccine programs though, important too. said, science says wear mask, I’ll wear one.

 [It looks like science say mean wear mask annually flu season now? That's vaccines herd immunity work - people become immune, less room virus transmit. That's we've already seen significant drop new cases. even transmit virus vaccinated (this proven), clearly far less likely without vaccine. tell you; I'm dickhead reddit (like you) california opened eligibility 6 million people today states similar eligibility openings soon 3m might easy sleep quality way since know thing now. Explains lot lol. True soldier, see Valhalla US Dublin👍 food bar none. Plus it’s gluten-free organically grown! agree, complaining leads nothing, why? Absolutely. article explains lymph nodes near injection site produce B cells necessary robust long-term protection. [as know, nothing changed since lack significant decrease not, fact, proof increase.  Israel's cases Saturday Sunday abnormally low rest week. Better look cases per day - weekly average. 2406 Israel, equivalent 87,100 US, 55,300 daily cases weekly average.

But cases shit metric compare countries number effectiveness tests vary greatly. US half daily tests Israel (weekly average). look hospitalization deaths, less influenced methodology Israel far butting conversation :) interesting thing fit people really walk much faster average fit people. potential stride length change fully grown. people poor health likely slow significantly relative speed healthy. Phase really matter. important part vaccines delivered state distributed. distributing vaccines still, make sense expand amount people get it.

If problem enough demand, makes sense move forward categories. Going source seems like simple correlation ""people living counties higher proportions uninsured individuals significantly likely fall ill die COVID-19."" seem particularly causal seeing uninsured people also likely impoverished thus likely work essential jobs, live crowded households, underserved testing contract tracing.

Doesn't really explain UK deaths per million US. vaccine's highly limited supply, there're lots people eager get can't yet, think government needs spend lot effort drumming even eagerness. people want it, I'm fine leaving back line. think title original article sensationalized aware fact sociopathy actual scientific term. formal version antisocial personality disorder, sometimes sociopathy used instead brevity (like title).

That paper simply investigates correlation APD traits mask wearing.

And yes, impulsivity risk taking absolutely APD / sociopathic traits. That's literally definition.

But, know, science hard. Saying 100% effective deaths misleading lowers trust vaccines since fully vaccinated people died covid since trials. data trails small test (in one died died placebo groups too). Yes, Austria turned due price EU negotiated. Shocking, given low cost huge impact health vice economically.  Pfizer shortage EU, AZ massive shortages UK despite funded developed primarily UK. 50% 60% produced BioNTech well that's good great response, thanks. would kicked huge fuss maybe involved lawyer.

I’m blaming parents. I’m blaming hospitals shameful policies always wrong. excuse.

At time many many people types policies. can’t even say hindsight 2020. wrong happening. Sounds like Oklahoman Cornhusker state would say! really turned 1.5 million doses - literally cost nothing?

The EU paying vaccines, member states are. EU negotiates prices. Canada sons school open since Sept. K-5 population around 550 kids. 1 case child within school testing positive cohort isolate. proper protocols safe guards done! Within province school transmission rate extremely extremely low 🤷‍♀️. also suppose difference whole province also levels lock down.  unusual cases developed related blooth cloths.

Blooth cloths must new medical term?

The suspension scientific basing, even scientists countries suspended vaccine disagree suspension. guess must know better zzzzzz There’s really much difference hospitalization rates get 50. way don’t mess around eligibility much, worries appointments going unfilled next month.  Why. there's reason bring word ""sociopathic"" it, except mislead

Sweetheart, that's actually term used psychology. random insult. Antisocial personality disorder formal term, sociopathy sometimes used brevity. traits investigated paper APD / sociopathy traits.

It's insult, actual scientific term. Yep. something appropriateness masks... missing E484K mutation happier seven across EU Germany? mass distribution vaccine ramped wide small production faster almost vaccine date. Production problems occur. comparison, set particularly bad side effects associated moderna vaccines San Diego January.

Thanks! traveling day 15 I’m super curious! Better safe sorry, we're cautious country, want make sure we're fucking up. 

The restrictions left marginal economic impact anyway. RemindMe! 73 days 



I think Cinco De Mayo US 2019, earlier. hope CA Memorial make way great summer! Precisely kids' nanny tested positive COVID today. timeline events:

Thursday: last day saw nanny

Sunday: saw unvaccinated parents nanny started symptoms

Monday: nanny got tested along husband I

Tuesday (today): nanny got positive result, still waiting test results

Wednesday: parents supposed get vaccinated

None us experiencing symptoms yet. know 48 hours time saw nanny time started symptoms. 48 hours since saw parents without us symptoms. timing, safe parents get vaccine, right? shut Wesley! year ago news Germany mainly ""take look Italy, take Covid serious"", can't remember much news USA. pretty sure ""German good""-news English German. Actually ""moon landing fake"" level Nope. understand statistics thus relative risk. According (page 28), efficacy measured 50.8% averaged days 0 14, 92.1% day 14. magic switch, probably ramp throughout days 0 14, break clinical trial data way. According (page 28), efficacy measured 50.8% averaged days 0 14, 92.1% day 14. magic switch, probably ramp throughout days 0 14, break clinical trial data way. News America simply entertainment long time. 
It obviously divided political party. 
They selling ideology viewers. 
They said hoax fanbase wanted hear. wait? start today?

I know efforts made encourage black community take vaccine. .. think got vaccines knowledge first place? According second link, lack education socioeconomical issues plague YMSM HIV+. addressing fact sexual education include fact gay people exist condoms used abstinence?

I'd call putting bandaid bullet wound, really akin saying person got shots fault taking bullet. Yes Yeah, understand people obsessed phases categories much.

If vaccinating 50k/day 65+ slowed down, open next phase vaccine 30k/day 65+ 20k/day category 2B? heading point hospitalizations going faster faster every day

This false. [US hospitalizations still way winter peak currently trending downwards fast rate. wasn’t gonna say certainly thinking it........ ""due to"" lack insurance it.. logic, driving used car ""causes"" covid. correlate due shared root cause US? Sputnik-5 Lite need passport get Canada anyway

No, don't. people cross live use passport. necessary.  many risk factors vaccine developing child. cause issues later life? infants body/chemistry?  Kids dying large numbers. need push. Illinois reputation corruption. legal weed also corrupt? lot Canadians keep saying ""We couple weeks behind US."" ex-pat, shocking much delusion Canadians handling vaccine. Meanwhile, US weeks away vaccinating everyone. Even got vaccinated couple weeks ago one eligible groups. know 20 year olds able get vaccine calling waiting almost-expired vaccines.

My sister pharmacist Toronto, currently administering AZ vaccine (only 200,000 given Ontario total). administer people 60 64 rated 65+. everyone older 65 complaining understand eligible. aunt 79 ineligible AZ vaccine that's right now. mess right now.

The US may world's worst response virus, world's best response distributing vaccine. fear getting infected around famiy year gone, even went another vaccinated person's house yesterday mask-free really weird liberating situation. fact Americans enjoy May simple amazing. Question. wife got first Pfizer doses two hours ago. risk anaphylaxis probably passed point, correct? Memorial Day. Mark words.* Memorial Day feel like 2019 people. Why? point Pfizer. Keeping hold vaccines even approved indication approve *really* shitty thing do. stocks could save lives *now*, notnin 6 months. matter phase long capacity maxed though. people need vaccine more.

If wasted doses demand slowing, makes sense open new categories. that's case, there's need push phases amount people getting shot day (and they're higher risk). Right would affect severity case, whether get case first place. thing think ncaa games? It’s also rat poison. Illinois open essential workers pre-existing conditions require verification. lot people signing up.

tbh chicago mayor fucking over, tho hope allocate Canadian Mexican brothers sisters. Open damn borders Canada. Gotta love someone mentions halting arm vaccine program defence mention something completely unrelated.  Correlation causation.. logic, driving used car ""causes"" covid.. correlated two root cause one way get high vaccination uptake, least travel hungry counties like Scandinavian counties: demand vaccination travel, see people afraid vaccine anymore. Israel waiting point though? drop 100% restrictions ASAP? Sup neighbor. lie? ANYWAY accurate. Gottlieb sort blankets assumption “20% less effective” Pfizer 95% wild type - maybe 75% SA. based JNJ 20% May even high. Tl:dr probably less effective. enough lose sleep night stop normal post full vaccination. point missed, means investigate. three people died millions vaccinated across countries, stopping rollout week two could potentially mean guaranteeing 1000's dying covid instead maybe 10 potentially none thing crazy.  Absolutely, get vaccines people who're eager take (including 41% Republicans, plus additional 18% say want wait see.)   able cross without vaccine too. exactly. UK variant already taking original strain Canada. think thing Europe. long another variant even worse UK variant comes along replaces one? 

so next one comes along, they'll probably lockdown way lethal, they'll say need time develop booster shot strain.... virus keeps mutating keep trying mass vaccinate. vaccines might making worse viable exit strategy pandemic. Yep. all? Even 40 million doses exported, explain shortage Mike, uncle, still antibodies May they’re gone now. I’m going say covid. Many baristas sandwich guy said people complaining taste lockdown. news story Westchester county New York. 1 per 1mln US   
atleast 40 per 1 mln Norway (4 cases, 2 dead 100k now)

totally fine xD AZ fans think conspiracy lol forever mystery.jpg Ha wife immuniser got first dose. sure get around xmas 2022 rate.  last time. brand new technology. Gad damn Lochness Monster! hhaha far, Germany, appointment second dose still valid. I'm quite certain continue next week (Fingers crossed!) maybe data it. even think people accept better things like taken seriously. Browns goin' way year! Yeah remember flu endemic viruses got stronger every year people vaccinated. /s Rite aid's website massive PITA many schools reopened safely didn’t covid infections? Stop misleading headlines. feeding crowd wants schools remote forever. Stupid compare efficiencies like this. trials different end points. let group come close finishing adding more

That's best way get many people vaccinated quickly possible. Pausing would bad  Even 40 million doses, EU still way short though no? Lol remember target 3 million April. 100k now. @nj_vaccine kinda closing door cat gets point? natives bring vaccines

Places like BioNTech (in Germany), Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson native run companies primarily employing native scientists? states get many doses per capita others. Seems kinda unfair. biggest deal little annoying  mean? mean 1/5 country actually caught covid? bring fatality rate way down? Unless want extremely top cautious yes it’s fine Got mine 30 minutes ago Hey ""smoker"" get now. Past present. like going test it. I'll waiting people ages getting calling past smoker. Meh, people end going next doctor's appointment, summer later, get vaccinated. long willing fashion, I'm ok it. "" if, know, thousands hundreds thousands people get better, by, know, sitting around even going work, go work, get better. "" meanwhile, states already opened back already reporting surges numbers

**Try again.** someone is, you’d probably call “conspiracy theorist” (in reality, like question/research things), respectful debate best.

I wouldn’t take medicine unless needed to, heck, rarely take paracetamol. changed mind vaccine around week ago, fully (young/healthy ect). research &amp; looking things logically swayed part. I'm astounded started Trump administration. hhappen? got mine pharmacy yesterday! Yes, safe getting students classroom, safe creating superspreader environments schools.

Edited clarity. mob gets really mad even hint getting hands ‘murican vaccines return full nascar attendance. warned, peasant! 🤪 true current strains. may true future variants. 

the issue whether vaccines promoting viral immune escape. Basically, vaccines contributing severe mutations witnessing? can't find appointments 50+ years old in-laws. Nothing available within 25 miles. Hopefully, shots. would totally play bingo vaccine clinic. ignoring Michigan Alabama? go second dose make wait 15 minute observation period again? Lol that's funny, think society care them? essential ""workers"", meant enjoy luxuries class rulers! actually kids too, Inc begun dosing patients mid-to-late stage study COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, **children aged six months less 12 years**, company said study assess safety effectiveness two doses mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart intends enroll 6,750 children United States Canada.  took flight flew LAX San Antonio thinks got airport bar. hospitalized 8 days later. Perspective: Even vaccine flu worse COVID without vaccine, children. I’m curious polled how. school asked parents decide person vs remote December; 53% chose remote families. person kids rotation half time. returning full time without rotations person kids, surveyed parents again. Admin expected lower numbers covid cases need finding child care week, families would choose person. opposite happened - slightly parents want remote kids per room. It’s stark difference study makes question it. Ok, someone else posted locations none near me. 
Too bad... lot people going vaccinated get regular doctor drug store without special appointment. probably June. That's super interesting, thanks info! Dude literally quoted memo commenting on. 

LMAO. Yes, this. side it, likelihood flu cold early February many parts country perhaps 100s times higher.  info, good know half new cases unvaccinated teenagers/children think going ok! younger brother many seizures childhood anytime got fever 100. went it, fast forward 10 years finished masters great. Stay positive got Parents know bad flu certainly do. That's flu vaccine. Oh wow. 35% dont want it’s correlated poverty, shouldn’t poorest covered Medicaid? Germany, short period time. 3 new cases alone March 11th March 15th. Usually 50 sinus vein thrombosis whole year whole Germany, Check, thats whole Institute (Paul Ehrlich Institut) for. there's way logically engage him. show medical science really taken good look vaccine made right call everyone take it. trust medical science, I'm sure anyone could say. Lol true, California's lockdown definitely worked. one lowest per capita case rates country (bested Hawaii, Oregon, Kansas) cases continue drop strong clip (-38% currently) country slowed plateaued. among bottom 10 vaccinated states.

People mock failure lockdowns ""heavy-blue states"", California case study failure. I’m aware that. one male case hundreds thousands administered shots enough deny second vaccine? don’t see scientific basis that, especially comparing numbers UK India. go. One state time 2 days two weeks, actually. Usually sooner later.

More concerning spread yo teachers wherever picked up. schedules full, fact we're using nearly vaccine indicates are, vaccines groups, right?

What missing? states sitting stockpiles vaccines. Even worst performing states put 75% vaccines they've received arms. Making list show larger simply would mean inefficiently applying limited supply need less.

When bunch vaccine sitting around I'll agree you. Open pipelines. Right scarcity water supply, pipe size (using analogy). vaccine contain virus. can't get covid it. Real world numbers UK vaccination roll far indicate AZ vaccine least effective Pfizer one... That’s quite oversimplification. Welcome America. kids school since September. Guess what. still alive. Shocking right? mother telling story scheduling first dose, involved swapping 'insider information' 70+ group extra doses, crossing county lines, waiting lists, got 'pick time slot' appointment page using information pharmacy 5 minutes home. Question: I’m US going CDC guidelines. co worker Friday tested positive. work forcing return tomorrow (Wed) location negative test vaccine. said it’s required CDC.

Is right? Sure. Captialism kills millions per year starvation imperialism, perpetuates racial gender discrimination. There's nothing unique capitalism allowed vaccine exist within year. Imagine military budget reduced 10%, could pay vaccinate millions, expand ICUs treat elderly people, etc. massive military budget necessary defend US's empire. It’s possible Covid. without knowing neighbors place scenario much higher average risk, you’d likely still give considerably higher odds reason pneumonia. variant prevalent right now, variant E484K mutation trusting doctors type... know that’s 2 weeks away? lot areas aren’t even 1c yet. Cool. people's opinions matter teachers', thanks sharing. vaccinated, able get things going. Except has. Vaccination conquered smallpox, measles, mumps, polio, whooping cough, possibly deadly disease humanity found way prevent, works mandated people get vaccinated, especially kids going public school. *warfarin

And it’s used poison blood thinning properties. die internal bleeding tried passing something like Ohio years ago. decided better wait something better.

Of course, we're still waiting... Right- I’m sure could appreciate irony- rich white people others saying virus hoax lining get vaccine- means know isn’t bullshit vaccine best way protect ourselves. Taxpayer funded daycare (school) essential two worker household. parents can't work without someone else looking children. Pfizer paid 100% development costs Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Only completely disregard years work funding BioNTech led ignore fact already BNT162b2 candidate ready February 2020 started partnership least MD using leftover lists make sure vaccine go unused (my coworker MD got first shot almost month ago thru one) ya'll better vaccinating frontline workers.

Meanwhile, Florida vaccinate frontline workers, they're getting enough vaccination appointments despite lowering 60+ yesterday... Move May rural/suburban/low population states. Possibly sooner quite states open next weeks. vaccinated, safe us around unvaccinated family members friends? risk us transmitting vice versa? get vaccine way effective point Imagine something like already market start pandemic - start next one Thank this, managed find appointment! No. Go order age group make sure everyone age group got vaccinated going list. That's responsible thing do. I'm sure change. essential workers schools shut COVID outbreaks? Scramble unavailable childcare? Use nonexistent sick leave? Lose jobs? 

What essential workers child comes COVID? Pretty much solution avoids homelessness starvation lie send sick kid school anyway. happens high-risk cafeteria lady?

Also, happens high-risk kids? Everyone else goes school reopens everything get watch bedrooms? get education?

“Yes, much society could better” - let’s build economy pile essential-worker corpses. that’s right now. You’re right, wrong suggest actual illness might something fake like anxiety. [Dr. Monica Gandhi UC San #COVID19 -10.4% past 7 days (covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tra…) US record-low UK today (coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/health…). 2nd week row, US COVID19 hospitalizations lower 2018, 2019 influenza hospitalizations. Keep eye prize.



What’s metric open? well way vaccinating overwhelming majority seniors. open vaccines available all? 2 weeks that? 4? case number? Certainly it’s hospitalizations deaths unfortunately. 


*California Centric know, still way less situation couple weeks found several healthy people died reason due faulty batch. Good luck convincing healthy person, close 0% mortality rate due Covid, take vaccine might actually give blood cloths. Even % wise correct decision take vaccine.

Hasn’t EU guilty well? Worried much cost vaccines financial risk making taxpayers fund vaccine plant expansions? 

I’m shocked countries couldn’t better judge cost/benefit governments funding covid lockdown support vs paying 20-30 euros vaccine...especially since vaccines (for diseases) 10 times cost even expensive covid shot (HPV example). measures taken save many lives. agree nothing approach either direction. appears seeking EUA, we'll least get update point love reading types news every day! uplifting contrast doom scroll last year. go guys! word did. Regardless it’s sick people use death legend political tool boost anti vaccine BS. Monoclonal antibodies thought prevent body making antibodies antigen, need delay vaccination cleared remnants monoclonal antibodies system vaccine works properly.

If fully vaccinated, contract covid, infected severely enough sick require monoclonal antibody therapy would reason get it, vaccine already failed.

The number people advice would apply worldwide probably vanishingly small. vaccines *are* also earning money. sold like pharmaceutical product. course time helping world pandemic. drive slowly passing lane and/or enjoy watery chili spaghetti? would USA use AZ vaccine going approved use next month? really pissing ignoring essential workers favor age.

Seems prohibitively expensive buy necessary storage equipment. 70% people 65 vaccinated least one dose US. I'd wager 75% total want get shot category (75% vaccination rate huge success, IMO).

That's line polling I've seen. Something people need keep mind talk opening different groups people, vaccinate harder becomes. convincing last 25% get vaccinated take time vaccinating first 75%.  


That's frustrating see people saying ""I want steal vaccine senior!"" nice thought, senior gotten vaccinated chances probably want destructive wait around hoping they'll come around. **zero** issue pharma company making 30% profit vaccine. Remove profit *at best* make vaccine 20% cheaper. Big whoop. Vaccine cost never issue. Distribution, ability administer them, patient reluctance driving factors across globe. Plenty wealthy nations NGOs willing pay cost can’t. think inequality solved vaccine costs $15 instead $20. Lol. ohioan, i’m super proud way dewine state handled pandemic. one first states shut we’re one first states eligibility all. dewine kept foot (for part) guidelines, curfews, mask mandates really think saved lot lives. went cdc guidelines came eligibility, good portion healthcare workers older people vaccinated, kids back school person learning (with teachers one first groups vaccinated, making possible). clear endgame site us he’s transparent goals need reach order “open” fully. super awesome completely unexpected, especially republican governor state voted red time around.

what fuck man another thing wont see light day like 2030? keep hearing nasal medicals seem development/testing limbo. Exactly. NHS UK government much bigger incentive buy AZ vaccine developed Oxford manufactured UK soil. Plus investment manufacturing past year, creating new jobs supporting economy. surprised UK goes almost 100% AZ future. supply issue, probably would already. suspension vaccination due non-problem reported health risk build public trust? 

Investigation require injunction. know people holding vaccination due safety concerns amount paranoia someone who's vaccinated went fine know personally allay fear emotional resistance, logical one. 

Policy makers understand difference reasonable emotional aspects public perception respond accordingly. lot anti-vax sentiment EU suspension AZ use feed fear symptom of. 

They suspending use. high profile figures (politician celebrity) getting shots taking W here. Paperclips temporary. Staples semi-permanent.

Also, [this contains good response supposed rarity conditions. Pfizer paid 100% costs development Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 

**Back April 2020**, Pfizer BioNTech announced partnership Pfizer paid 100% development costs. Agreement Germany comes **September 2021, time already successful candidate** conducting late stage trials. German money spent actual development vaccine, Pfizer money.

Any German money BioNTech may received vaccine went ""market authorization"" (applying license) manufacturing facilities (which came online back February 2021). 
Source 1 (April already started working Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine pleased announce details ongoing collaboration, **which reflects companies’ strong commitment move quickly bring safe efficacious vaccine patients worldwide,” says Co-Founder CEO BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, terms agreement, Pfizer pay BioNTech $185 million upfront payments, including cash payment $72 million equity investment $113 million. BioNTech eligible receive future milestone payments $563 million potential total consideration $748 million. Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine.**

So German money used factory Marburg developing vaccine. 

Source 1: 2: makes clear article US won’t give away vaccines, Americans offered it. happen relatively quickly, it’s worth government initials discussions/plans countries would prioritized. destroy economy good yes generation boomers (75+) so?

Part good leadership planning. yes state going rate US whole, city going slightly slower.  Got moderna last night too, way. searched. Authentic 3M n95 masks sans valve? majority vulnerable vaccinated, see major spike even open zero completely open people getting covid bad bother getting tested needing go hospital good vaccines rolling out, slightly behind Europe really good thing. Europe rough state looking vaccine rollout. 

Hopefully things speed soon tho. agree Paperclip would job, think there's problem stapling either. roommate got first shot? I'd say go! 


You seem like safe thoughtful person, I'd say earned this.  rewarding people fat?  think joke. can't justify paying people bring food? Western socialist kids labor 2021? created many new anti-vaxxer accept scientific evidence new batch safe 'that one batch March also 100% safe'.

That's already happening though  is. storage use timelines different mRNA vaccines. pharmacies cryogenic storage needed vaccines. Western countries China never China. ultimate decision came ""Take chances living virus,"" ""Give government enough power implement policies restrictions like China,"" I'd rather deal lifetime COVID pandemics live nation respect human rights. has, half measure approaches taken Europe places like NYC proven equally disastrous. 

I think people studying years come arrive conclusion way effectively handle covid 1) use technology invaded privacy, 2) impose authoritarian lockdowns willing population, 3) close country world exceptions military-quality quarantines.  majority would gone senior citizens excluded Germany . believe it. big difference prevalence mask wearing urban rural areas Texas (the latter mask even ""required""). Mid April two weeks March 30th. Plus influx demand surely push appointment dates May. 

It's great people get opportunity get vaccinated, though! I'm not. Watching entire city get relegated 400 vaccines week nice shiny suburb north gets thousands. I'm Milford car. I'm looking drive hour away. Hell, I'm sure willing go lengths, easy find it. folks looking something close specific vaccines. That's said good luck. Plus, right now, sick 60. family qualify yet. opens 16 over, bet finding openings easily. don’t need vaccine everyone. even close. 

Children etc. don’t vaccines. 

Also people got covid already don’t need vaccines ASAP. 

These easily enough stop spread allow normal life. absolutes science. NHS trial said “The majority patients infected UK love clickbait-y controversial enough. Albert ""LePfizer"" Bourla Biden promised make sure every American access vaccine giving nations.

Its short article. sub becoming dysfunctional, feel like lose IQ reading comments. 

1. lower quantity, lose scale. lose scale, need raise costs. 

2. Covid like diseases, may require effort eradicate it. 

3. SARS, MERS, COVID, may wise consider adding COVID booster yearly flu booster every years. Compare $20 booster deaths, hospitalizations, economic hardship. normal disinfectant toxic. found nontoxic substitute  vacc clinic volunteer 1000-1500 day (those SAT/SUN numbers), 4 weeks now.  sites open, cant imagine done quicker done first place. nope! Let's honest Pfizer deserves serious applause right now---they exceeding targets massively effective vaccine. Agreed timeline, overly cautious also dangerous. We're rock hard place. Personally wish people's livelihoods destroyed I, healthy 29 year old, catch COVID. Certain risks must acceptable society move along, benefit taking relatively small risks. time, 50+ right think I'd find tradeoff worth it. months vaccination ought trick. Maumee basically Michigan anyway. Also, never said bigotry policy exists. outdated policy based fact HIV used epidemic testing inaccurate decades ago. Neither things apply anymore, bad science imply gay men danger blood transfusions ignoring new information. awfully rigid limited perspective someone yelling science me. New York City million-to-one-odds event happens 8 times day.

Life short taken anyone us time. Get live it. Hm.... wonder COVID variant bearing effectiveness... Nope. already like least month now. states opening everyone 18, mainly ones small populations trouble using doses select portion population. Florida known large elderly population also large population, larger NY state now. fact voted troubling. Californians wear masks outside like kids pacifier. guess comforting, much anything  live even daycares masking up? agree thats pretty shitty. seems applied 3 times day 2-3 days.

The virus lives nose throat days moving lungs. kills virus chance spread

Check study it’s trials last years. Trump right putting disinfectant inside body? Lol Yeah, except Covid denialism big rural states well anti-vax sentiment. Wyoming big dumb dumbs “plan,” state loosening restrictions 70% vaccination. reason need? I’m surprised bought best vaccine. Expensive. impression Brazil doesn’t lot money...? 

I wonder countries helping pay since variants impact global commerce. worry. Americans going share they've full vaccinated everyone there. even sharing vaccines approved yet therefore use for. I'm saying Russia is, ones it. Texan, shots, weed mask mandate please? thought Colombian. It’s much optimism, though, seeing lot people outright saying “I don’t care restrictions anymore, I’m wearing mask get vaccinated” things ilk. Probably reason he's this. beat Michigan matter cost. Heads calling people ""illegals"" highly offensive actually referring undocumented immigrants. Plus make sense, considering entering country seek asylum example port entry amount illegal jaywalking, somewhere along lines small fine.

But yes, getting ID much difficult certain segments population, makes much difficult access various services even vote. 99% effective preventing covid? mrna one appealed more. I've preferred one. 

But J&amp;J one morning appointment mrna one evening would take first available even hours.

""Don't care how...I want now!"" =)

That truly feel. Used “ever”, year, might’ve six months one point, it’s 3 months now, IIRC.

It’s stupid, frankly – I’m Descovy, get tested every three months, **and** carry CCR5-Delta32 mutation, gives immunity HIV-1 strains. 

Literally random ass straight person **much** likely get HIV am, long shot. virgins got HIV 90s blood transfusions will, even ungodly amounts unprotected sex anonymous strangers. totally agree there’s much US could better. However, doesn’t need come expense re-opening schools.

Statistically speaking, children 500,000 dead people mostly adults. Heck, many children probably grandparents. way virus impacts older people versus younger people, parents school-aged kids highly unlikely impacted.

Yes, small number essential workers mentioned die become disabled (either short-term long-term) virus. what’s solution? police, military, fire, utilities, trash collection, health care, etc. needs stop there’s spread disease? that’s case, society cease function. meantime, people going work, kids losing valuable years education parent CANNOT stay home without society ceasing function.

Yes, there’s much society needs better, including taking care families essential workers die. keeping schools closed, we’re rewarding essential workers ruining kids’ educations futures.  think cases, less needing shot, attitude like ""I assume doctor working behalf make arrangements."" got appointment 65+ last February hospital clinic (back appointments extremely competitive), response was, ""oh, I'd like something closer 20 minutes away, I'll wait doctor schedules me."" UGH. insisted go week went learned (a) doctor access vaccine, need go major vaccine providers, (b) none friends able get appointments, became appreciative. think government's money comes from?

If Pfizer starts getting shitty it, would fine government taking patent away them. Pay development costs, let keep profits made got greedy, send message *profiting* citizens fine *profiteering* not. Metrics, make reasonable.

This worked last May. Post-vaccine, real estimated cases drop X deaths hospitalizations drop Z, exit state emergency.

I'd actually argue illegal establish emergency powers without defined exit strategy. We're talking suspension basic human rights.Necessary, way easy overextend. yep cuz concerned new virus fear mongering, great day   absolutely evidence psychological illnesses even leads credibility immune disorders, something theorized already. marrow cells around brain posted sub documented suffering long covid. immune disorder would actually help explain that. last bit evidence leading long covid immune disorder seems women men, something also common among immune disorders. vaccine jolting immune system could actually make sense treating covid related immune disorder Hop on, folks. We’re going ride. 

Aside screwing beginning, China dealt virus far responsibly west. Every idiot wants freedumb gives virus another chance mutation. gave unluckiest person planet billion pulls slot machine, eventually person would hit jackpot. 

Coronavirus already successfully mutated two known dangerous strains. many chances mutation hits big one? Pfizer create it, BioNTech Germany did. small handle logistics partnered Pfizer. Kroger site add 10 years date birth initial automated screening. Select time anytime Friday. filling patient info put correct DOB. 

I mine scheduled Friday! Ebay many 3M fakes - burned 3 times recently. Somewhat convincing packaging, fakes. search continues. might want remove words ""3M N95s easy buy now"". far tell, case. I'm talkin' Ohio example above. Cleveland area specific. THINK saw works South Africa variant, wondering anybody concrete info details? totally get saying. answer, unfortunately. think way harness collective good ALSO takes account inherent self-interest.

What feels sort like mandating ""abstinence-only"" prevention STDs. theory, everyone chipped obeyed, STDs would gone jiffy.

But won't, else do? Pennsylvania sucks! Spending hours trying get vaccine mother, me. Lol guys still dicking around state sites? go Walmart Walgreens websites. easily find small town pharmacies won’t check shit take minute sign Gizmo, poster child smug arrogance. Nahh mean like testing multi millions people 3 times 2 weeks. won’t praise China much whipped Covid kept down. 3 friends country 3 different regions seem concur. one friend Shanghai amazed much citizens pitched beginning. signs aren’t encouraging. states jumping gun, states never bought all, rhetoric coming cautious states leads believe mask mandates stick around longer actually necessary. don’t see good balance look around, see extreme politics driver seat. Fingers crossed thoughtful CDC exert moderating influence.... Sure wish WA would so. hospitalizations plummeting. Case count useless metric older vulnerable population vaccinated. 20 year old getting COVID doesn’t matter grand scheme things can’t pass vulnerable population. suspended campaign administrating known product able end pandemic claiming 10+ lives every day (in country size Norway). low probability deaths occurred post vaccination caused vaccine (trial safety data, control population UK millions already vaccinated,...). yeah that's pretty goddamn stupid ask me. Media wants “surge” happen bad. God r/brexit cess-pit lmao. making effort get White Republicans board, that's case? Dude bring Cicilian italian sub. got shots, 200$ ounces. bet distribute vaccines quicker half states hold opening everyone. shit end vaccine enough arms, care gets long lines are. Put vaccine arm, regardless age.  Got mine today parents 🙌🏻 biggest issue take forced mask mandates codified legislation. government assuming powers granted citizens country state question. dangerous precedent set push back it, even agree spirit decree. True. EU trading block. good negotiation, case contractor badly simply go court. that's fine normal times. Sadly normal times yet. One way another EU change afterwards, that's sure. Here’s theory. European news focused news (can guess what?) summer US lot cases. think continent government really thought America many cases didn’t lockdown hard enough. nation full stupid people it’s many cases. news focused things time, news rarely covered operation warp speed. average European didn’t know aggressively US ordering vaccines not. winter came Europeans found hadn’t beaten covid all. need vaccines too. missed boat. still understand we're apparently Wave #4 distinctly remember told last Spring continuous burning ""dry tinder"" therefore apart first Wave. edited comment make second link visible period probably (understandably) missed. know scientific data decade atrocious behavior Reagan ilk. know government completely ignored raging epidemic, never even acknowledged happening last year office STILL mention gay community all. Researchers around world trying anything reduce risk, research takes time. regulators like FDA even slower research. COVID helped kick regulatory boards century lowering time limit 1 year (way restrictive) 3 months. Imo think could probably go 2 months. Maybe members monogamous couple came  in? would reduce liability know would affect risk. I'm researcher regulator. Im sure there's blood banking team statisticians know exact algorithm used balance risk vs amount eligible donors. blood banks want many people possible eligible lobby every day FDA. can't go transfusion recipient risk threshold. even see boosters would fit whole picture. already trouble vaccinating everyone year, prospect restart boosters every year? USA content ban exports, wants people die instead using vaccine enemies.

Predictable. think people overly critical here. multiple options available around time, take one prefer. shortages three vaccines right now, like vaccine take end someone else's arm. There's nothing wrong choosing one prefer unless means waiting long time different one. Assuming live US:

Pfizer two-shot vaccine. nearly completely protective symptomatic COVID (95% efficacy). second vaccine intended taken three weeks first vaccine. considered CDC fully vaccinated two weeks second shot, five weeks first shot get time. reports extremely rare allergic reactions, overall considered extremely safe. Side effects fever, arm pain, tiredness, body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

Moderna two-shot vaccine. nearly completely protective symptomatic COVID (94% efficacy). second vaccine intended taken four weeks first vaccine. considered CDC fully vaccinated two weeks second shot, six weeks first shot get time. reports extremely rare allergic reactions, overall considered extremely safe. Side effects fever, arm pain, tiredness, body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

Johnson &amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine. fairly effective symptomatic COVID (72% efficacy US), nearly completely protective hospitalization death. considered CDC fully vaccinated two weeks shot, although immunity continues growing another two weeks, might want continue somewhat conservative risks 4 weeks out. Overall considered extremely safe. Side effects fever, arm pain, tiredness, body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

They're good options, honestly would take ended Pfizer available me. never said that. said vaccinating phase 2 now. There's available appointments we're prioritizing shots arms doses appointments. Well, seems like sacrifice good cause. don’t think death ok btw. Source? fake batch different bad batch.

Yea is. sister-in-law's mother, lives Eastern European country kept refusing Astrazeneca 'they accept enter UK'... Admittedly sharpest minds local media convinced AZ bad even UK allow main vaccine... Scandalous. still see particular flag prominently flying residences businesses, guess (sadly) unsurprising. Maybe people don’t health insurance likely lower income go work places increase risk exposure (like grocery stores). Stupid. everyone. pay yourself? thought y'all free healthcare... Aren’t tests like $40 piece? Sounds pretty useless tbh ""squash it"" mean ""reeducate harvest organs?"" Canadian... jealous... I’m still awaiting Lexus surge remember That’s much costs Ohio medical still worse :/ Nursing homes fully within rights enforce mask wearing personally believe everyone wear mask! think nursing homes physically enforce rules calling cops trespassing someone goes sick without mask. nobody know kids school age want send kids back schools without safeguards needed schools rin area really place money needed teachers. me, propaganda Likely job pay required health insurance correlates higher risk factors (occupation, household income, race, co-morbidities) Regina Canada lot times make ineligible though, right? it?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 10 counties moving red tier today, nearly 90 percent state indoor dining back along gyms movie theatres. people let *experts* holding real data speak, get useful information. insurance = poorer = likely get Yes, that’s fair point. Thank you! think ask doctor opinion. Covid incubation period usually 4-5 days, people showing symptoms day 12. test negative day 7 you’re probably fine, it’s better get professional opinion can. CDC’s website recommends waiting whole quarantine period 14 days getting vaccinated order protect people might come contact vaccination, also acknowledge 7 days exposure negative test means you’re likely infected cut trials short emergency approval.

As understand phase III trials completely new vaccine usually run minimum 6 months statistical significant number cases tested positive. everybody exposed Covid number always reached six months, much faster normal. diseases could normally take many years. trials cut short saying makes lot people believe it.

Some bureaucracy accelerated though. example vaccine I'm waiting for, Crohn's disease took year get approved first trial, sitting pile applications somewhere. second trial got put halt due Covid.

EDIT: Note I'm commenting kids trial, comment trials cut short. doubt find actual 3M N95 masks without valve anywhere. N95 masks FDA NIOSH certifications still hard come by. However, Chinese KN95 place. suggesting lie eligibility skip line? really see ethical solution.  13 EU countries paused vaccinations 

I understand it’s EU-wide decision, decision made many prominent EU countries *obesity Lol everyone Midwest gets vaccine   might sound weird veterenarian offices. I'm sure could use extra income right brain fog tiredness past months, believe lack stimulation due lockdown. shouldn’t put front press put spot hot button takes clicks. respected peer reviewed analysis appreciated values opinions whole. expectation comfort everyone view exactly problematic many levels health insurance make likely get case covid? two escalators. Ḩ̶̦̣͈͚͎͂͆̄e̵̤͍͈͕̻̓̍͝ ̴̨̃̃p̶̡̤̻̅͛̆̀r̶̮͇͚͚͛́̿͜i̶̝͙̪̬͑̈͝n̷̞̺̈́ţ̵̘̳̮̲͐͜s̶̨͈̙̫͖̉̍̈́̊͝ͅ agree you. AZ relentlessly lowered targets committed previously. something like 25 percent now. runs issues suddenly doesn’t deliver. perfectly good AZ vaccines sitting fridges would save thousands EU lives right 40% COVID cases 1/3 deaths due lack health insurance. That's 12 million cases 180,000 deaths! imo % population far away important stage game. I’d never trade two vaccinated people one specific group. Things slow rollout avoided. virus doesn’t care are. find seems like focuses travel within EU. anyone heard anything vaccine passes working third countries? Came say this. really deserve kindness native people especially they're shitty treatment ever end. mom got San Bernardino county cvs didn’t check anything either. part, agree flu dangerous kids. protections, vaccines. Plus children seriously immunocompromised children, kids undergoing chemotherapy etc could suffer serious complications. child catches virus COULD Lo term effects. Hell ANYONE catches virus could. It’s new, don’t even know what’s going happen road. Don’t tell I’m “living fear.” kids go school participate life friends (in masks) starting soccer. It’s ok afraid kids. everything protect them. shouldn’t make people feel weak wanting added protection kids vaccinated adults  EU money authority finance plant expansion, prerogative member states.

EU like US Federal gov, minimal power comparison. shocked countries couldn’t better judge cost/benefit governments funding covid lockdown support vs paying 20-30 euros vaccine

True lot countries fooled last summer covid almost disappeared Europe, though worst refused buy vaccine quota. Yes, offer us barbecue haha Would preventing people walking nursing homes coughing? walking unvaccinated nursing homes without mask general right now? 

I’m also little confused government aspect. arguing don’t believe government right government shouldn’t right? former doesn’t make sense me. Regarding should, reasoning seems government enforce rules related clothing. don’t understand clothing limit government though clothing inherently makes clothing completely individual. argument shouldn’t enforced getting infected reality people don’t know they’re infected feels weak. someone sense they’re infected? know could infected interacting others without mask increasing risk dying? already limit freedoms harming others, degree even unintentionally (although would argue know we’re possibly infectious right now). crazy deeply UK posters care EU. seems soon start inviting EU states join kingdom. many Americans subreddit think EU country. also Deep South state still mask mandate. Good question. That's like continuing drink tequila shots tested Cirrhosis liver. case liver fine. sphere influence though need getting vaccines ASAP.

This ""news"" really big deal inasmuch Russia can't make much vaccine - hence they're trying get EU companies make it. EU fucking individual countries making decision? Supply issues fault manufacturer's EU. Demand seems pretty high except extremely rural black belt counties. Profit motive strong driver. Americans, yes even reddit, seem happy US well creating/developing/producing vaccines better anywhere else world. reason profit motive - US strongest companies, best production capacity, best scientists - reaching brass ring. make profit disease - one glad ready act. 

There may legitimate gripes Big Pharma - profit motive ain't one them. means masks, distancing eventual lockdowns forever, then? think 2 weeks 2nd dose difference may big. I'm waiting 2 weeks I'm higher risk safe side know huge difference. frustrated parent, think waiting right thing do. It’s ethical test experimental treatments children aren’t age make kinds decisions themselves. 

Adult participants cognitive ability think risks. additional hospitalizations, amount per day decreasing faster cases even. Nope. US also said well head EU medicine.

So basically biggest bodies knowledge available datasets 1) cite estimate IFR? perhaps several?

2) Almost every peer reviewed study point ""outdated"" unreasonable standard, period. Unless ""rapid communication"" rare. need show something changed end December today proceed ~10% infected ~33% infected. Best luck so.

In fact note welcome address concerns corresponding authors. I'm sure they'd glad help. What's alternative? we've French, German Italian politicians baselessly casting doubt efficacy safety AZ vaccine *months* now. entered make difference, to.improve life. taking corporate control structure. scientists make money corporate vampires take everything regardless human cost includes scientists physicians staff working them. use professional public position increase profitability. ""orders magnitude"". like twice. ""Orders magnitude more"" would usually start around ten times many cases.

The choice vaccinate (and even administer medication) result balancing risks benefits. 

We middle worst pandemic last 50 years.

Clearly benefits outway risks. like Donating lived Philippines. give Noodle Soup 🍲 Juice 🧃  8 Units blood (1-2units per session), get certificate picture wall  Staying inside home always safer venturing world. true covid, too. Safety, however, thing matters life. real. anyone would want kids beyond me. Guess fuck bad worse pandemic fucked us up. Go buy pack cigarettes way vaccine appt. Apparently Smoking eligible according quick look PA eligibility checker. Meanwhile we’re fucking around allowing 65 get Open shit already. Enough enough. 

You understand what's going on.

Israel gotten far vaccine, based population, anyone else. U.S. enough vaccine vaccinate everyone. we're prioritizing old people, danger dying.

Opening vaccinations everyone would mean 25 year olds would get vaccinated 65 year olds, makes sense all. Covid-19 hundreds times deadly old people young people. would vaccinate hundreds 25 year olds save amount lives save vaccinating 1 old person.

The reason Israel able get much vaccine small population 10 million people. U.S. 330 million people, enough vaccine everyone yet. make caps Facebook post sign up, we’d get boomers week. dataset 10's millions saying completely wrong.

Heads going majorly roll EU this. Exactly, people know going in. lucky happened day vaccine work home. rather take chance vaccine smal chance something happens not. Considering second dose likely make sick days coworkers say can’t afford miss work neither anyways. Hopeing best Borders closed. None us really clear open borders removal restrictions FWIW, Alabama 68% administered. others least 70% today. could 'open source' vaccine. What, going whip batch garden shed?

The fact is, order permitted sell vaccine all, AZ commit providing cost everyone duration pandemic, cost *in perpetuity* low middle income countries. good thing everyone (apart people shares pharma companies, course).

Of course still expecting make profit long run. Especially good PR future contracts hoping get back this. that's fine. private company shareholders.

At point going start holding leaders account fuckups Lmao, guy acting like smarter you, thanks claryfing stats I've seen 37 cases 17 million doses.

Thats 0.0002%. far trend even could straight causation link them. statistical blip.

But EU knee jerk like gives ton fuel antivaxx run say vaccine kills whatever. even get little sticker vaccine pass naming charge number, yeah, easy track. weren’t serving shareholder you’d vaccine 5 years. Yeah, opening larger groups us easy way score political points people think ""great, get vaccine now, state awesome"", actually mean anyone get vaccine appointment. might counterproductive still unmet demand among high risk/exposure groups gets overwhelmed low risk people taking available appointments. 4 days ago. still valid. Florida January (I'm California) tell that, least Orlando, comparison terms % people wearing masks, mention real restrictions.

Also, people want wear masks still Texas, regardless mandate Governor. Awesome response. OP ball hyperbole.  largest dataset AZ shows there's link many experts studies\*. EU killing population political reasons pathetic. see lots resignations court cases this.

\*Look sub links Well sure it’s drug company buy 100 different developed drugs tries gets 1 100 successes. It’s like NIH university’s giving rights free. many university’s huge portion endowment pharmaceutical profits.

People seem forget literally 1000s vaccine ideas didn’t make cut. Hundreds preclinical trials still lot entered phase 1 clinical trials didn’t pass first round. Shits expensive can’t done one university thus requires large multinational corporation funding mom works nursing home also houses covid patients. still refuses get vaccine. sister gave birth 4 weeks ago. Got vaccine. called yelling saying vaccine going kill baby thru breast milk. Misinformation among conservative really high Scheduled is:

AstraZeneca 70 million (Initially promised 200 million) 

Moderna 35 million

J&amp;J 55 million 64.6% people US age 65 least 1 dose. Death rates continue go down. Anti maskers going protest? Omg, dare kill grandma!

Politicians stopping vaccinations? Thank oh merciful overlords protecting us evils Astrazeneca!

Stopping vaccine two weeks cause thousands unnecessary deaths one blame politicians... I've watching rollout Ohio closely. think seeing pattern am. Less people vaccinated per day doses delivered. Presumably think due everyone eligible vaccinated fast enough. guess want open broader audience optimize usage doses. UK struggle pandemic ever properly control Europe hasn’t. There’s much cross-border trade goods movement people. unvaccinated Europe act Petri dish new mutations vaccinated people UK risk Covid 9months time protection wears off. return normal open borders whole continent (/most world) Covid control equivalent person owns water source

Well like person developed novel way acquire water thin air. dont get excited, michigan keep expanding groups cant find appointments Pretty sure number 14 days, increasing 80% 28 days much data almost everybody trial got 2nd shot. amount people got 1 shots large enough sample size gain usable info it.

I read scientific journal anything remember reading article take grain salt. Alright, well suppose we’ll see weeks then. suspect fine. Exactly! Well said. some, always reason delay. felt way day received I'm 6 hours second day feeling pretty run achy. two people know received vaccine day feel similarly. That's great news. I'm hoping good sign indicating returning summer Chicago too. always go course last summer. I'm KS. I'm eligible yet next week (if I'm reading requirements right). went couple sites county's site, none seem tell you. county says two shot vaccine. grocery store says either 1 2 shots makes sound like know 'til get Walgreens wants set account site have. Dude. specific sort cerebral vein thrombosis, general pulmonary embolism blood clots. mentioned today would expected case known sample size, they've 7 far short period time, mostly young women. That's odd needs investigated. Maybe cross reaction another medicine, case slap ""Don't take take XY"" whole deal move on. make Getting blood work tomorrow. levels always off, I'm anemic iron deficiency. Anyone success getting doctor's note vaccine? understand technically immunocompromised, state (NY) slow expand vaccine people age I'm sitting back watching people find ways play system get it. Try Walmart. didn’t even verify eligible. stuck Really eager know also. bummer ending really exciting initial drop. Maybe better wait v3.0 Ending pandemic fuck Michigan. love it. fairness CA, population MUUUUUCH smaller. know Oregon's excuse though. It’s people stupid. It’s problem country needs address. Okay, third time, maybe one work.

No one trust Russia's numbers without third party verification. He's making statement based _unverified_ numbers Russia.

Do understand going try dance around one fourth time? uncommon repeat vaccine boosting regularly. case, live area ticks carry nasty encephalitis virus, vaccination regime first - 3 months - second - 9 months - third - 3/5 years - booster - 3/5 years - booster .... Reminder: free wear high-quality mask protect even without mask mandate. 3M N95s easy buy - go ahead get one worried COVID wear around religiously. demand others wear mask benefit. seen anyone deny existence virus sub downvoted oblivion. 

If mean people comfortable sharing opinion year data showing states wildly different covid policies ending rates hospitalizations deaths, maybe restrictions went far protect us much people would us think, yeah, I'd agree that. Thanks providing simple explanation. Extinction event case, think theory unlikely explanation simple reason UK using AZ since early January, whereas Germany since mid-February (I believe). 

Increased incidences CVST would seen UK *before* seen Germany, attributable vaccine *generally*.

If we're talking bad batch UK started using later Germany, yes, might see reports UK soon. Swim across lake Erie! shot I'll buy ya beer! Bear mind wyoming actually roughly 65% per capita deaths texas. much better.

The states far even done half assed job keeping deaths getting high New hampshire, Washington, Utah, Oregon, Maine, Alaska, Vermont, Hawaii. people wear one mandated

I thing Venn overlap ""people wear masks"" ""people listen follow authorities"" probably circle.

If wearing before, vice/versa. Good luck that. 

Maybe one America, Europe bow rules. not, take junk somewhere else. Lots companies willing sell less. Pfizer exec says there’s “significant opportunity” lightspeed piece shit. Kids still spread virus mutate. would want try eliminating spread completely? Even China far aware, companies like Sinovac private. Used year long waiting period sexual contact men donate blood. COVID, lowered 3 months. literally idea it’s safe children.

Let's real -- make trial ""have idea safe children"". good idea safe children, need data sure, get numbers high enough see there's weird effect that's seen 1 10,000 patients, example. Thanks clearing up. hospitalized last year got two transfusions. stopped making red blood cells due Adult Still’s disease. I’m good now. Always wondered though clean healthy blood was. Anyone get vaccinated Texas went since work school. Walmart didn’t even attempt verify. checked insurance. Made fill form. Gave covid card even got shot. Doctor gave shot walked out. asked doctor didn’t verify. said “goal get everyone vaccinated,who pick choose” Reddit funny “trust science!!!” agrees preconceptions “ignore science!!!!” doesn’t.
 
Reddit already mind made every vaccine every way safe. I’d rather trust science thank goodness pulled it, probably know random redditors. I'm generally liberal come, I'm happy see happening now.

I think bigger divide authoritarian/libertarian right/left, concede Republicans made hay opposition, Democrats returned favor. Great news. know Mass planning April 1st gen pop Phase 1+2. already everyone wanted to, pre-register number up, make appointment 1 mass vaccine locations I'm surprised tried squeeze 6th dose/vial EU delivery yet. see anything 22 scientist there? statistically similar clotting issues general population here. mentioned today would expected 1 case sample size there's 7 far Germany, 3 deaths. might small number still way expected average. They're also young (20-50) mostly female, odd could suggest cross reaction something similar. Considering we, example, 48 deaths 20-29 age range entire pandemic, even 3 cases within short timespan concerning need investigated. Maybe not, coming covid, large investment fund something, opportunities invest going major country pandemic control, EU sat endless lockdown time next year, probably small break summer, stagnation traitor. strip Michigan card. bit here. Russia certainly decreased trust tomfoolery (putting lightly) US exactly helping supply atm

I wouldn’t say it’s sake geopolitics though, mostly Russia isn’t trustworthy likely jab reapproved fairly shortly public confidence takeup taken hit based concrete evidence.

I still see people insisting people allergies can't COVID vaccine, MHRA contraindicated vaccinating people history anaphylaxis *less 72 hours* back December. 50 dollars person enough vaccinator come street go door door. Lol watched it, one things glad hear point presser reported rates two connected events (low platelets clots) there's focus somewhat likely inflated based attention gotten heightened requests report related symptoms taken AZ 

anything everything could described layperson ‘clot’ could reported potentially linked, thrombocytopaenic haemorrage, perhaps associated DIC ITP, cerebral sinus thrombosis DVT/PE &amp;
bundling single entity increases odds confirmation bias--

 people shortness breath, small marks calf pain report symptoms receiving AZ vaccine might otherwise reported even symptoms without vaccine, would expect see numbers artificially inflated little I'm midtown Manhattan today, no... literally everyone outside saw walking work morning walking around lunch break masked.

I expect last things warm least. dont execute them? They've got get back Florida man soon possible guess. cant schedule appointments unless lie webpage.  Looked scheduling 22nd previous requirements reasoning schedule looked around find good study, assumption since US never restricted interstate travel, lower restrictions Europe, consistently shown higher overall antibody prevalence serosurveys versus Europe, stands reason higher levels baseline immunity due infection, helps overall herd immunity numbers. 

I'll keep looking good study back up. saw one pretty good months ago winter surges. Fauci unreliable? critic originally. would like think good sources. WWII, government made factories produced toys/items general public switch war production. dont see wouldnt appropriate here.

And, individual basis, theres incentive invest vaccine so, know, love wont die! global pandemic, subjected it. yup, this. matter happens, people ready scared. first states get crap they're getting ball rolling need that. pausing use vaccine link blood clots? like thing still trial phase. Millions doses already administered. data need already exists. great news! know downvoted. Phase 3 requirements pretty lax Inslee moved quickly move announce moving Phase. Unlike California, trapped latest reopening phase requires numbers difficult reach moving lenient phase. Better Washington's method, least openly announced moving relaxed phase pretty early on.

Now Washington's vaccine roll-out good slowness focus tiers ideal. fact think Biden's address last week, Inslee would held steadfast tier last phase would eligible summer/fall unlike Biden openly said adults eligible May 1. FEMA vaccine site Oakland Coliseum actually impressive bit emergency temporary government infrastructure I’ve ever seen.  Gotta love casual racism Trump well run dry CNN. i'm definitely wearing mask winters now. much better fuckin windy Agreed, Pfizer rolled much earlier, oldest people would received it, health workers, also prioritised early. think mostly given mass vaccination centres, larger freezers, AZ gone GPs etc. reason wait received plasma treatment otherwise she’s good go sub. Every day dude. brutal. Yes. That’s referring to. Wouldn’t issue parents didn’t send knowingly positive kids school. kids quarantined job jeopardy I’m high risk selfish jerk. parents won’t held responsible. Half eu Canadians American lite. infection happened long ago. I'm buying *conspiracy* yet, something admitted. much EMA tries save us push vaccine, time EU countries almost try destroy either vaccine's reputation usefulness. Italy approve vaccine 55s, comparison, 98.9% (basically 99%) died Italy COVID 50 (I link official source it).

Yeah, would give overall effective vaccine population even EMA approval? **month** later vaccine authorized 65s, still minority terms dies COVID country. government around 7-10 days later concede use age, still, people severe illnesses eligible it. 

France Germany also limited vaccine age availability 65, people need vaccine.

And know, could vaccinated EMA authorization's sight not, dying third wave.

I know anti-UK sake shooting foot. think characterization accurate. case, experts different countries disagree. People trusting random opinions, instead confused difference expert opinion. UK, experts saying fine. Europe, saying concern. real story here? No, vaccine interacts antibodies recently infected, would seeing bad reactions left right. clearly happening. CDC recommendation received antibody plasma infusions severe Covid, wait 90 days vaccination may unknown risks foreign antibodies interference vaccines. vast majority people receive antibody plasma infusions. Correct, “cases!” numbers matter less elderly high-risk - *by far* likely end hospital/ICU dying - vaccinated. bump cases predominantly among young people life resumes matters far less vaccine. one line makes study useless now. stand behind vaccine hesitance. said want see happens. Pfizer Mederna vaccine used something like 25 million people each. longer hesitant.  ""We got [expletive] shot now!"" American First. last guy. closest major hospital group Taos is… close. Ski resorts original seed many outbreaks across mountain west, doesn’t surprise me. Optics.

People get upset US starts shipping vaccines abroad there's supply constraint US. said would make sense abandon AZ altogether US given supply already have. didn’t envy anyone making calls right now. Either there’s something vaccines (v. Unlikely vaccine overall, considering uk vaccinated 11mil significant problems) they’re overly cautious caution lead deaths overall due covid. 

Even vaccine rare dangerous side effect reported, It’s choice small amount high profile deaths young healthy population directly attributable vaccine vs large amount deaths older less healthy population can’t directly attribute vaccinated. probably know morally right thing (save many lives possible), politically, cannot get away knowingly endangering people, it’s ultimately palatable accept people die caution inaction. We’re numb death rate rising rapidly, won’t notice hundred week across EU would AZ vaccine. 

The way see it, run risk collateral damage. Either vaccine covid. 

I’m young unlikely die covid, probably still likely die covid vaccine. 

It’s likely I’ll AZ vaccine won’t choice. Still going take though. hopefully catch Covid 😊 Rather never left USA thinks whole world like it, worse. somewhat true US well depending age child. know littler ones can't visit. Source: friend incarcerated daughter nothing got logistics. got fact Europe exporting vaccines (even US) US exporting zero. I'm literally shaking right Actually cases Pfizer too, small numbers plastered news. I'm glad though anything gives rise panic vaccines bad thing they're thing getting us mess moment. I'm literally shaking right worried countries pausing use vaccine. Surprise surprise, it’s seasonal virus. Combine small amount vaccinated folk, you’ll realize masks, lockdowns, restrictions useless. Yay science!^tm Unfortunately weddings take advance planning, much I'd like wait week before, really want make plans assuming June like. We're also California things little regulated/strict.

Any type event, would agree! last thing want assume, maybe turn people away day itself. 

I also think things ton better metrics June! plan now-ish :/ run mill ""blood clots"". patients low platelets cerebral hemorrhage young healthy. prudent least look it. Okay link gave say anything affects people doesn't. think question still stands affect you? Ah, NHS and, seems, well-funded public health. remember community committee lot people public health Ohio 20+ years ago budget cuts happening then. They've gotten worse. think probably also political response dropping mask mandate. argue: ""Who needs masks everyone get vaccinated?"" I'm literally shaking right now. Phoenix still tough particular vaccine get. JnJ helped lot now, though. I'm literally shaking right now. NY CA ahead Southern states per-capita basis [according amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

I would taken Dec offered one I'm going lie - certainly feel lot comfortable getting 10s millions already have. 34 students. 6 feet untenable 3 badly we've packing students rooms seem like hold 10 fewer students. yes make numbers drop there's lot concern, fucking kidding? Let’s call spade spade. It’s thinly veiled racism. fine treating prisoners like dog shit. it’s minorities incarcerated higher percentage whites, it’s treating like shit criminals, systemic racism.  Except could real lockdown ~6 weeks 100% back normal April 2020.

So getting economy back normal nowhere near important political showmanship ignoring science. LOL, like guy ever restaurant I'd support robust system track got vaccinated allow travel across border. guess means no, solid studies it? Yeah logic worked really well Texas energy regulation front recently. It’s called democracy. Vietnam basically dictatorship  mean reactive politicians want discredit best chance vaccination? talking friend nurse said thought Coronavirus end like flu shot: something take year.

I started researching originally thought hoped vaccine would like traditional vaccines take once. found basically said know yet. obviously want vaccine last long possible data available still air.

Anyway, wondering anyone information that? Specifically, life potentially look like everyone opportunity get vaccine taken effect? hoping virus stops spreading vaccinated important road? hoping develop one vaccine last forever? hoping develop vaccine take year 2 people live like normal? Links articles quotes experts would ideal anything remember better nothing. “angry Texas” camp imagine Wyoming sparsely populated there’s much risk case county in? Tifu didn’t implement federal vaccine program threw vaccines states. Lol. previous administration wanted hand states. Seems like really didn’t want anything anything.

They agreed 'in perpetuity' middle lower income countries condition chosen make vaccine all.

nah haha. Thats power math people 100% true probably downvoted. feel bad anywhere masks ""mandated"" outdoors. even were. people didnt take time look SCIENCE, news feeds them. cant help crack im hiking middle nature open air person starts coming front frantically reaches mask get get them. OPEN. common sense isnt common anymore. manipulated media. theres paper paper proving respiratory virus hard catch outdoors needs circulated smaller rooms poor ventilation spread well, news wont tell that. best people walk sidewalk selves driving around car mask on. like.....seriously. people walkin outside putting face others peoples face blowing ok see theyd protect themselves. know isnt happening. pray society cause last year exposed even manipulated are. Less 4 months initial rollout available everyone. Absolutely incredible. rightly suspend vaccine investigate what's causing really special clotting/bleeding issues. normal blood clots. might issue production EU since issue detected UK vaccine produced India. wearing mask annually flu season science says should? heard considering using antibodies produced proxy indicating immunity rather waiting requisite number placebo group naturally infected. think given circumstances it’s warranted make bet antibody production adults mean greater immunity it’s fair assumption much quicker feedback. Based on....? I'm 1000% fan vaccines (give them), agree I'd like *little* testing get little monster shot. 

I know shots already mostly known safe, huge test. Like, 1000 kids shot month without issues, I'd probably feel comfortable giving kid. 

The current tests / trials perfect, hope things get approved kids get shot school starts fall.  Funny conservatives US want bring back manufacturing everything shut foreign factories. hold another 2 months, people make another excuse stay locked down.

But yeah France flirted unconstitutional measures throughout pandemic glad called measure least. 7 blood clots vs many thousands dead?  point, believe telling people mask mandates go away vaccination rates reach (whatever) percentage encourage lot people get jab.

Some folks know (CA) reluctant that's mindset. ""Why bother still wear mask? I'll stay home like been."" year moving goalposts feel like end sight. I've convinced many could I'm one guy. (I work healthcare, got mine January.)

Some consistent messaging higher necessary too. I’m concerned risk getting blood clots Number tests isn’t important cases spread high enough leads higher chance variants developing 

(fyi i’m variant fearmongerer really worried them. point # cases still isn’t completely useless metric!) point fucking now. vulnerable vaccinated. close herd immunity. contagious variant (that ass fucking Europe right now) gained lot ground US. 

Roll back restrictions? Sure. Go full bore open masks? That’s stupid. one learn anything last time reopened?

Absolutely nobody suggesting that, something making up. man, ever kick *shit* strawman created.

People chemotherapy ill people excluded obviously, people allergic vaccine. Recent research efficacy drug called Ivermectin means treating preventing Covid-19 opens door possibly options provide treatment group people.

The vaccines don’t eliminate spread either; people (unfortunately) need careful numbers favourable regardless. heads. believe yet known much vaccines reduce spread antibody titers disappear immunity remains.

I’m honestly hard time understanding comments. kinds numbers expecting?

I feeling many people extremely unrealistic expectation vaccination would affect numbers speed. anything, drop currently observed Israel surprising magnitude, way around. wonder FDA crazy enough approve anything AstraZeneca shit show EU Germans help curioisity-- I'm interested regions mandated FFP2 mask ago like Bavaria, lower covid case growth vs regions not?

Hopefully we'll results end year entire population vaccinated. !Remindme 3 months Ahh shit... go again... Maybe could magic like BioNTech deliver more! Let's hope. Gays Allowed Quick napkin math:

48 million doses administered date, 62 million distributed. (and that's big if) AZ delivers remaining 15 million doses get 40 million total end Q1, that's 50 million people vaccinated.

Add 100 million vaccinated Pfizer, 17 million Moderna (35M doses), 55 million J&amp;J (if deliver), 35 million AZ (if manage deliver 70M 270 still owe EU manage get 30M end Q1) – that's 50+100+17+55+35 = 257 million.

Out total population 445,8 million, 380 million adults age 18. assume need vaccinate 70% adult population, that's 277 million. 

In words, assuming delivery = vaccination, early Q3 doable (with EU trailing US UK 2 months) - however, people fully vaccinated late Q4 (12 weeks AstraZeneca doses). New vaccines approvals might speed process, lot.

This course leaves 123 million adults 65 million children unvaccinated – meaning vaccination campaign extend well Q3; however, deliveries go well EU able achieve 70% July. ;) think mask mandates go away sooner people think. believe (U.S.) get 50% vacinated case counts low going summer, virtually need keep them. seems like it. happens people.

Especially Pfizer 'are having' similar numbers blood clots. Let public loose trust vaccine something can't even linked due small numbers.

Norway 4 cases. vaccinations continued said risk that, Norwegians would lose trust health authorities. they've shown willingness investigate take things seriously. FHI decides there's connection, Norwegians take vaccine, situation would led trust, less. interesting, neck bothering eating tylenol Advil stave pain enough normal. got first Feb 10th 12th Feb. everything became painful move again.

Four months (at least, hear proposal) lockdowns every time new covid stray coming Poland? Perpetual lockdown smell.

Supporters total lockdowns, opinion, miss point. one country makes lockdown matter ones that. El Salvador closed borders entirely 0 confirmed cases, yet stop bringing covid there. Sometimes one super-spreader coming business trip abroad sufficient, happened covid well. Coming logic, see two options. 1 - wield 8 billions people houses four months, 2 - let life go own, prepare hygiene standards (i.e. disinfection put public places, securing supplies hospitals etc).

I'll get 8 10 year old kids vaccinated soon possible they? when? thought current investigations for. really know far pandemic? true? GF Covid really bad, hospitalized all. gave me, tested positive mostly symptom free, aside able taste smell anything.  

Just wondering innate immune system fought virus, vulnerable would make reinfection. 99,9999% straight lie. Given 1A PA \~50% adults (over 65, pretty wide essential worker categories, BMI 30+, smokers), 100% shortly 1B opens. 1B 1C job categories, excluding anyone who's otherwise 1A. totally sure, group seems max 5% population. Nationally, we're currently vaccinating around 0.5% people - PA tiny bit ahead national averages - 1B 1C would like week each. understand knee jerk reaction eu. statistical evidence pointing towards higher incidence blood clots population vaccinated AZ Oxford compared non vaccinated population.

By logic, chance vaccinated could higher incidence shot claim vaccines cause.

This could EU petty vaccine UK (Brexit divorce politics means sides acting like children). could EU governments giving bit excuse poor vaccine rollout seeing. Maybe overly cautious. Germans French pissy Pfizer. seems like phase I. Make sure safe kids, provisionally approve soon thousand kids gotten vaccine went week two without major side effects. I'd give kid half dose today. Many millions doses gone adults around world many thousands gone vulnerable children Israel places, without significant negative effects. 

This virus sends 2% children hospital! absolutely way vaccine's danger end within two orders magnitude that. 

We're going start supply demand soon, would make lot sense vaccinate willing waiting children try push shots idiot refusers. also much realistic pathway herd immunity. would people giving blood transfusions sample general population? I'm almost tempted say might underrepresent positive cases, people really staying home costs might less likely go even give blood. I'm saying world ending lol. Vaccines work still know new variant, we'll find there's research current vaccines effective enough beat mutation not. Yes panic also yes could concerning maybe not. Time tell. one counts December. ratio undercounting we'd 135 million cases now.   lots people extremely conservative orange-leaning area refusing *any* vaxx risks like Bell's Pasly, etc. made point tell drug risk, vaxx drug, percentage trouble cases near justifying afraid prevention disease.

If covid, cause might it? socially distanced day surgery part peaked interest. go surgeon schedule surgery another neck fusion tomorrow. year since I've covid got second shot last Friday. nervous surgery peaked interest. still priapism side effect. admittedly know nothing vaccine QC processes I'll take said face value.

What know REGULARLY get notifications pharmacy medicine I've purchased batches recalled.

Nice searchable list here: Enter pharma name search examples. Many ones I've found due manufacturing recent personal recall experience this: manufacturing issues specific vaccines (found within 10 seconds 2017 FDA warning letter — strong rebuke agency — said contaminants cardboard glass found vials posed “severe risk harm patients” indicated facility’s process manufacturing sterile injectable products “out control.”  records show multiple batches vancomycin hydrochloride, drug injected hospital patients infection penicillin won’t treat, recalled 2016 take imply trust vaccine. take soon governor Ohio lets me. I'm saying CLEARLY untrue ""a bad batch almost impossible"" even national health authorities? follow advice WHO.

And reopen everything virus transmissible humans. Xi said so! conspiracy theory. antibodies mean covid. point lose antibodies (still t-cells) excited pandemic. can’t imagine lot money spend everything wanted. 

Anyway wife going end April two friends son I’m happy anyway lol
And mom wants go halloween I’m gonna try make there. determined random cat bag. Nice. Red Cross data December 2019. However think classify national security reason. research I've read says (antibodies typically fade 3 6 months, depending individual exposure). 

But there's also recent research says immune systems T-Cells remember make new antibodies,. get exposed again, short period time body ramp start producing antibodies again. 

Your body can't produce ""all antibodies things time (constantly)"".. that's resource efficient. (there's point producing antibodies threat currently exist body). lord knows know many ways troll. export rest. stay home bed Show data? It’s handful cases discussed media/govt press releases.

You’re pretending though “I data” moral high ground, you’re spreading data know unrelated issue discussed.

Governments pausing vaccine actually save lives. give citizens confidence issue pops up, government transparent, investigate recommence prove link. Contrast governments nothing, yet media continues report issue, people would absolutely lose faith vaccine (and likely others).

But American exceptionalism guess. financial times click bait media, article specifically includes Germany. fuck even talking about? one demanded UK stop using it. one even cares UK here, EU decision vaccine manufactured inside EU. oh nooo recently published hahaha. abstract interesting, read later 15% state, 19% Florida. appear sero tests people taken thought infected, routine medical tests though, overestimate. jive number deaths state though. apparently scientists Norway Europe too, recommend course action. Yay! can’t wait vaccine 2 year old daughter EU literally stabbing eyes knife try spite UK. 

I simply understand use citizens like this, leaders prison really angry leaders nations suspended vaccine.

Oh really ? OP talking leaders nations. Norway specifically. Maybe read start comment chain shilling. HIT thing... big issue vaccines effective countrys vaccine deployment progressing well.

Merde... so? Everyone know got Pfizer felt sick 2 days. count 4 days Pfizer (though recognize that's outlier) small numbers people vaccinated vaccines use west Pfizer, Moderna Astrazeneca similar numbers. Nobody thinks related vaccine Astrazeneca thats ben put microscope. listened EMA press conference, German-Russian journalist brought figures equivalent thromboembolic events deaths recorded Germany post BionTech-Pfizer innoculation asked vaccine paused given numbers. 

A Ums Ahs answer, mostly boiled to, we're focusing AZ member states reported concerns Let get work front computer hour, worked phone thought wouldn’t problem 😬 Here's I'd like know: 

What mortality rate Astrazeneca administration vs many dead expect 2 week pause vaccinations. 

Is source this? german officials make call without looking numbers? [Link Google Translate Clearly point, they're worried blood clots, specific, rare type clot happening 2-4x frequency expectations recipients AZ vaccine. literally right know downvoted.

The ""issue"" occurance specific type thrombosis reports occuring Pfizer vaccinated populations.

People need stop using Pfizer's overall blood clot incidence talking suspension motivated investigation one rare unique type thrombosis source that, specifically AZ vaccinated people?

In UK data incidents completely line expected norms vaccines. local chapter Red Cross conducting blood draws ""outside open air,"" I'd would donate often they'd let me. Today reeling. Pfizer call smugly speculating boosters THIRD doses initial vaccine addition yet another rendition “wow people talking pandemic yet locked (smaller number) cases won’t (bigger number) cases” driving wall. Cheerio then.

Maybe see couple months Commonwealth Day celebration head? article states one knows green tier look like, speculates masks social distancing asking ""experts"". There's concrete info article description misleading. need to. did. countries close cooperation. Might new concept you. Op talking Norway, maybe read comments shilling. Why? know make profit AZ. Nothing. Updated include newer Microsoft products. improves public confidence. one would take vaccine media health officials reporting issues, government nothing it. 17 million people Europe received AZ vax. threat expect see serious numbers sick people outside statistical norm.

Yes, might recent batches quality problems. might show ""big statistic"". need statistics many people suffered complications per certain batch. Oh wow!! Good know thank much! Wrong. Sinuthrombosis yearly incidence around 3 4 per million per year. Germany alone 7 cases 1.6M vaccinations mere weeks using vaccine. factor 50 one would normally expect. Norway three cases around hundred thousand applications. I've feeling way since vaccine rollout. know people road trips, skiing traveling I've stuck home mom high risk girlfriend takes pandemic incredibly seriously (her presumed close contact tested negative, I'm still allowed see two weeks).

I laid October finally time travel explore, family SO. feels like wasted time, playing video games, applying jobs maybe outdoorsy stuff like hiking every then. catch 22: without pandemic would never laid off, pandemic, can't use free time however please.

I get sounds bit selfish wanting go stuff world burning down, incredibly frustrating feeling like Squidward meme everyone beach house, skiing touring breweries across country. time feels wasted I’m 19 envious seeing people around age get vaccinated. mom tried getting one got vaccinated wouldn’t budge :/ click link?, literally say politicians made decision coordinated ban. Maybe jab children given low risk? Focus vulnerable populations- elderly, obese, etc

We don’t give kids shingles vaccine either, something you’d want have... That's interesting anecdote. hope far path recovery. easier tell virtuous care others admit making decisions driven fear anxiety.

I say someone spent years trying break anxiety disorder took decision making. easy justify defend one's anxiety issues. fully passed times, let know hand I'm drop risk. Now, always start fully laying legs ice pack neck. issue since began like three donations ago. No, gave evidence believe morally correct. choosing ignore it. US government chose help world it’s citizens, I’d extremely mad, chose vote every one elected officials could. make program roll dice million times sometimes show 6, 10 times row. randomness probability.

Who talking Norway ? talking european countries posters like claim political decision hurt AstraZeneca UK reality consuming junk media falsely reporting things. decisions made leading vaccine scientists. Like ones showed instead keep parroting inflammatory garbage comments. Seems like AZ spending money ""grassroots"" support online instead focusing delivering tens millions doses promised deliver. 

AZ shittiest vaccine producers. Got vaccine free Oxford due pressure Bill Gates, otherwise Oxford would open sourced it.

What fuckin scam !!!! thought nine last week coming week? wrong? say disagree. know risk could extremely elevated particular batches even single doses application vaccine itself. Continuing would acceptable knew cause lies patient otherwise randomly distributed.  Glad help! I'm blood clot survivor group FB. life-threatening DVT number years ago one worst, agonising experiences life.

Someone asked group week many people joined got clot COVID number responses terrifying. Compare fact major scientific body saying AZ vaccine causes clots.

My first jab Pfizer based evidence I've seen, I'd agreed AZ vaccine question offered instead. hospital system donate Northern Vigirnia stopped testing Abs February 28th. Sad times. never tested positive actually fully vaccinated looking forward next appointment see positive. clearly safe vaccination special form thrombosis occurs orders magnitude often would normally.

Is actually orders magnitude common? last read thought still less expected general population without vaccine. Merkel need phone Macron ask back decision? decision turns wrong, BTW. want J&amp;J one shot vaccine. I'm terrified needles. 

Despite that, I'll take whatever I'm offered time comes. Yes, course count, highly appreciated. well others contribution. trouble understanding vaccine administered Covax needs produced poor underperforming India, US still hesitating step forward allow produce vaccination american soil nations Covax programme? blow mind. Public health member state competence clarify 'normally extremely rare' form thrombosis 'extremely rare' vaccinated population unvaccinated population.

There evidence common AZ vaccinated people person without it. I’m pretty hesitant medical treatments people can’t consent. There’s line somewhere obviously, kids would still getting polio measles, sure qualifies given low risk death complications children.

I think covid people panicked they’re even thinking logically- downvoted, even though position extremely reasonable. I'd really like see rate vaccines.
If different, cause specific media coverage would interesting. actually is, pretty common moral dilemma. basically ""Can kill person save 10 people organs?"" larger scale. Yes!!! hard time, hard time accepting this. people country Argentina, depends Oxford vaccine, produce it, reject it. I'd say average weekly/monthly deaths good metric, especially compared historical Flu numbers. nice graph showing different 2 are. 4 120 thousand vaccinated AZ gotten serious symptoms Norway, seen elsewhere population. happened vaccine trials, would 100% stop investigate going on. Want go concert? Fly plane? Going need vaccine paperwork. - Dosing/Storage error

- patients COVID (remember common symptom)

- Complete coincidence

I would bet job 'bad batch' supply chains products like very, tight. worked flu vaccines past, regulations Europe incredibly tight. unless think QP going end prosecuted everyone must start thinking options. Paywall. someone copy paste text? two years. stored easily. given spend time hospital led basically day. used pregnant.

It's also treatment given type blood clot gotten everyone worried AZ vaccine. Well that’s pretty disturbing. old data. It’s 75 percent willingness take vaccine US now. germany led science. Maybe stop consuming clickbait media ? investigated first look look deadly. 

The worrying part detected PCR tests. words mean shit.

We've seen ""commitments"" EU broke already multiple times.

FUCK AZ !!!!! kind decisions made politicians co-ordinated. decision taken politicians.

I showed germany recommendation Paul Ehrlich Institute responsible evaluation vaccines germany. saying people unscientific recommendation purely political Federal Institute Vaccines Biomedical Medicinal Products, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) higher federal authority portfolio Federal Ministry Health (BMG). institute, located Langen near Frankfurt Main, researches evaluates biomedical human drugs immunological veterinary drugs approves drugs. responsible approval clinical trials well pharmacovigilance (recording evaluation possible side Yeah called JJ cancel unprofessional Walmart anyway. Didn’t even see list trouble. confirmation. Pfizer booked actual hospital good call anyway. I’m pre signed in, wait car called safely. lot professional, know I’m getting it. Almost like sign, could driven way JJ, told wasn’t system. Walmart idea going on. thank Yeah people need stop going far direction saying clear nothing going here.

I think rollout halted something connecting vaccinated populations one specific type brain located blood clot, look German data clear investigation justified.

Halting rollout meantime covid causing deaths many orders magnitude higher quantity questionable part I'm Latino. Anecdotally know whole familes got virus found family member tested one else family reported case authorities could document. really stupid, something donate akin blood? think body handle amount blood take donation I'd like help somehow. definitely see sucks.

I've kept low vaccinated friends getting together hang without unvaccinated ones. kids supposed get things like measles polio vaccines decided testing kids limits? would forever approved adults. anyone think would say otherwise? Lol, reminded scene  NYC: Shakespeare Park returning summer! Recalling Newsom help state, destabilize it. Moderna SE Anti-vaxx? nothing anti-vaxx.

I speak found Norway, weird combinations symptoms seen before. common factor taken Astra Zeneca vaccine. talking ""statistically speaking 1 N experience symptoms anyway""-argument, first thing also always ask myself. 

The professor chief physician Rikshospitalet Pål André Holme said never seen particular combination symptoms, happened occur three patients received vaccine. said ""wasn't improbable"" connection vaccine described actually look like side-effect, extremely rare, still side effect vaccine. Lots pills rare side effects lethal, still use expected positive effects justifies tiny risk.

So course need investigate it. didn't, would helping anti-vaxxers. going label... 

You absolutely idea talking about. Anti-vaxxers problem among politicians, doctors health officials Norway. contrary urges everyone take vaccines. 

And weird anti-British conspiracy theory completely crazy. Norway member EU, Brexit much news anymore, people really give shit EU-British relationships. seriously completely mark, suggestion utterly bizarre. Norway among first pause use vaccine, decision nothing EU-leaders done.

And btw, find one despises anti-vaxxers anti-experts me. one. one can't even friends morons. tolerance people like that. One last thing consider would antibody test itself. range sensitivity (and price). Northwestern University study far sophisticated test available labs, found far higher percentage Chicago antibodies previously estimated. able detect antibodies people previously negative commercial tests. Red Cross undoubtably using whatever affordable option is. 

I think US 30-33% total population COVID already. Enough estimates line even previous administration's whatever really change it. Ironically, appointment last Saturday ended getting Pfizer. Needle probably least noticeable shot I’ve ever gotten, side effect (on dose 1) soreness injection site.

Great. going get fucking troops out?! look like god damn dictatorship bullshit. currently troops ground DC Afghanistan Iraq COMBINED!!! 43 year old behind first line! rate see vast majority states opening everyone mid April. thank much! I've added everything [the wiki I’m glad see disagree still civil. California may soon get green reopening tier. Here’s experts say could look like
Susie Neilson | March 15, 2021

Since California first rolled four-tier, color-coded coronavirus reopening system last August, least restrictive level yellow, “minimal” spread.

The system green tier — design, officials said.


“We don’t believe there’s green light says, ‘Go back way things were,’” Gov. Gavin Newsom said news conference announcing system — preceded devastating winter surge ended 50,000 Californians dead.

But Wednesday, case hospitalization rates plummeting statewide thousands vaccine doses administered daily, Newsom acknowledged state changed course.

“We working, quite literally, green tier,” Newsom said visit Southern California vaccination site, “and number months, anticipation bright light end tunnel.”

Newsom elaborate green tier might look like requirements would be, asked elaborate, California Department Public Health referred back Wednesday comments.


But several experts told Chronicle thought green tier might look like, region could enter it.

Some restrictions still likely
“I think definitive thing said right green tier would less restrictive yellow tier still restrictions,” John Swartzberg, professor emeritus infectious disease specialist UC Berkeley School Public Health, said email.

“The yellow tier includes indoor business operations modifications. Therefore, imagine green tier would allow business operations open (this would include concerts, etc.) without modifications.”

Swartzberg said much state could possibly enter green tier Californians reach community herd immunity — could happen summer.

Still, said, Californians green tier counties would likely wear masks practice social distancing public spaces.

And coronavirus pandemic ends, California transitions green … tier?

“While sounds appealing, give careful consideration learning pandemic changing long-term behavior,” Swartzberg said. “For example, would much better future [we] adopted culture wearing mask one least indication respiratory illness (this common Asia). Further, restructuring society crushed together people become norm.”

‘It better safe’
Robert Siegel, professor virology immunology Stanford University, said he’d prefer even stricter definition green tier Swartzberg’s “widespread immunity” metric — positive connotations color green.

“Green means go,” Siegel said. “So better safe.”

Siegel said green tier exist goal, something counties work toward. implemented case rates county reach zero — i.e., county community spread.

At point, virus could still spread Bay Area residents regions California elsewhere U.S. region zero community transmission could effectively contact-trace new cases use technology like wastewater monitoring hunt new cases targeted way.

“The risk won’t go zero unless it’s zero world, green means go, mean basically controlling this,” Siegel said.

Under Siegel’s green tier, pre-pandemic activities would resume, including massive group activities like concerts football games.

“Until there’s eradication, there’s much flow California, you’ll still need wear masks things like certain situations,” said.

Still, Siegel believes green tier county could operate close would considered “normal” 2019 — right challenged idea normalcy altogether.

“Elsa line ‘Frozen’ says, ‘The past past,’” said. “We never go backwards, always go forwards. There’ll time people able family gatherings graduations weddings, that’s coming soon, we’ll never go back way things were.”

Back January reviewed highly pessimistic timelines November vaccines available Private hospitals.
But I'm extremely grateful arrived soon March. parents got vaccinated private hospital minimal interaction large number people. I'm quite happy now. got first Moderna shot! 

When chip activate? article:

Van Gucht emphasised Belgium following reports variant closely, mainly reports tests failing pick variant.

However, many different tests used different laboratories, according him. “And possible one particular test problem one particular variant, necessarily mean case tests – quite contrary.”

“Each test detects one three different parts virus,” Van Gucht explained, adding different tests detect different parts.
“Usually, good test depend detecting one specific part,” added. “So, mutation one part virus, signal may lost, usually second third signal found.” would think so. Almost everyone sub freaking angry Texas announced reopening. seems like everyone happy new state reopens. article paywall me, here's Moderna's press release saying first participants Oh thats great news. Maybe Russia key getting shit back together then. 1.6 million AZ doses administered Germany. vaccines available less risk  Can't believe still people going around saying masks required indefinitely even vaccination, trying justify that. That's nice PDF however previous Administration actually responsible implementing never bothered actually read anything. claim get back az? Imo ensure link found, politicians face blame. cowardly decision cost lives long run. Sounds like Norway fucking process somewhere effected countries given millions vaccine... Anti-Vax strong “hippy” liberal communities. Barkley Marin California major anti-vax populations. Also black Americans fall group. Look number NBA players refusing get vaxxed Ah, age old question: without promise obscene profit, would excellent vaccine all? 

It’s old question, every industry problem. 

Can altruism drive innovation? Hm...

EDIT: people misunderstand I’m saying. It’s difficult question don’t answer to. 🤷‍♀️ Random events lumpy especially mine data looking lumps across population subgroups. U.K. tied ego national identity vaccine? It’s silly juvenile. country behaving way. Get grip man. 

The public don’t give darn vaccine came from. want know it’s safe it’s effective. That’s it. 

Put 🇬🇧. [USA looking towards largely groups people? difference taking concerns seriously (Halting use batch performing investigation specifically precaution) paranoid overreaction (halting use vaccine piecemeal manner advice main regional regulator way looks rather political based tiny number cases)

Yes simply relevant. Even conjunction Thrombocytopenia, wont still around 1 million so.

In Norway 4 120 thousand vaccinated AZ, gotten rare combination symptoms.


None 300 thousand vaccinated Pfizer seen symptoms. 



Now, know patients Norway treated medicine regulating immunesystem, suggesting cases caused sort reaction immune system. Good them, one forcing experimental shit people’s throats. Especially 99.99% chance surviving actually get virus. feel like Europe screwed early response. governments weeks months warning compared us Asia absolutely nothing people started dropping dead. instead one hard lockdown, itty bitty regional “restrictions” also placed barely effort contact tracing. utterly baffling.

A hard lockdown would cost politicians jobs, could much better now. Things could recovered back almost-normal like Australia / Vietnam / Taiwan / New Zealand. someone setup appointments online older folks, wished let skip step know it. make show card anyways.

I fully expect anti-masker flu season would rather sacrifice lives put 5 inch cloth covering face. brain fog tiredness fairly common symptoms viral diseases like Lyme Disease, example. would assume it’s simply “anxiety”? Presumably vaccine manufactured different facilities? recipe perfect, mean baker gets cake right.

I data draw conclusions either way, personally lean side keep vaccinating. people try conflate vaccinations intellectually dishonest. *If* knew risk evenly distributed caused specific factors, would worth discussion, yes. imagine specific confounding factor turns risk extreme. would certainly want eliminate factor. Tells us 20% Americans already COVID may need vaccinate 55% Americans reach ""Herd Immunity"".  interview Pfizer CEO said Netanyahu called 30+ times one week make sure got vaccine. Honestly, shows commitment helping citizens.

Even 240 days though, large majority people limit detection. see could explain nearly twice many infections seropositives. 

Our 1-in-3 number came previous administration's CDC without backup. we're vaccinated number mean much anymore, would assume unrealistically large. vaccinations move general population seems likely we'll soon never know. evidence based all. Using data would see case rate blood clots frequent Pfizer AZ. long Covid seems psychosomatic lot people 

How so? Gathering I’ve reading, seems like folks take longer clear viral loads bodies, isn’t uncommon. Additionally, many viruses stick around bodies, like chicken pox (shingles), Lyme disease, HIV, etc. even thought play role autoimmune diseases like MS.

I’ve complained problems referring *all* long haul symptoms “long covid” many symptoms could coming many different triggers - physical mental. 

Of course, lost smell taste, chronic cough/sore throat dealing anxiety related symptoms. However think immediately ignore possibility dealing “brain fog” (an umbrella term itself) clear vaccines could suffering mental health related symptoms silly. disappointing. one resist calling suspension politically motivated? really exaggaration say EU willing hurt vaccination campaign (by stopping vaccinations AZ also hurting public trust vaccine given again) try damage company retaliation? vaccinated group people within period 14 days vaccination, approximately 1 1.4 sinus vein thromboses expected statistically 1.6 million vaccinations. However, six cases sinus vein thrombosis plus one medically comparable case, i.e. seven, reported Monday, March 15. PEI writes report: ""According calculation, cases sinus thrombosis reported would expected statistically chance.""

Even occurring rates 100% attributable AZ vaccine, toll suspending rollout going far, far harmful.

I understand duty care, surely could clear notification alone.

“Hi, know may less 1 200,000 chance complication investigation consequences. Would like proceed vaccine?” new vax technology rushed through. It’s studied decades there’s previous clinical trials them. never real need now. FDA approved

So plenty things yet see one batting eye taking random supplements. Thanks reply.

 Could share calculation got ~20 cases per million figure PEI working with? I'd prefer see studies analyze effects immune system babies, least two years inoculation. One month, babies, seems way short. want additional damage reckless. [This publication Paul Ehrlich Institute (Germany's vaccine safety institution) today. relevant parts translated DeepL: seven cases (as 15.03.2021), **a special form severe cerebral venous thrombosis associated lack blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) bleeding** diagnosed connection vaccination AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine \[...\]  number cases AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccination **statistically significantly higher number cerebral venous thromboses normally occur non-vaccine population**. purpose, observed-versus-expected analysis performed, number cases expected without vaccination time window 14 days compared number cases reported 1.6 Million AstraZeneca vaccinations Germany. **About one case would expected, seven cases reported.**

They also state patients (6 female, 1 male) 20-50 thus high risk group Covid. also mention pulling specialists ("" thrombosis, haematology adenovirus specialist."") look cases detail concluded ""is recognizable pattern connection reported diseases mentioned AstraZeneca vaccination implausible.""

What they're 1. figuring whether connecting issues (medicine cross reactions, charges, etc.) reevaluating risk/reward. bring comparison contraceptive pills going around Germany essentially state medications, risks well documented available package leaflet make informed decision. need arrive point vaccine: figure causes this, reevaluate risk rewards also informing public potential receptors vaccine risks. lmao.

Already happened. IIRC AZ vax provides minimal protection SA variant. There's also speculation CA strain picked mutations extremely dangerous region dependent AZ immunity. good news looks like they're trying compete viral vector vaccines see mRna vaccines still edge fighting Coronavirus I've never heard places actually requiring proof outside early medical professionals showing badge etc Don’t forget, timeline could well speed up. Sorry, misunderstood you. responding 'best hope bad batch vaccine'. I'd say best could hope would happened anyway - millions bad batch AZ doses would good! Maybe cutting expected supplies half, twice, weeks notice, causing great disruption several countries' vaccination programs, OK?

Yeah American without horse race either way don’t know think what’s going on. It’s scientific decision, several scientific medical sources said keep using vaccine. people reddit pretty insistent it’s political decision either. I’m sure it’s stopped exactly investigation mean sensible pause vaccine, given risks *not* administering vaccine. think stole AZ vaccine pretty much confirmed. care one way corporate espionage.

The bubonic plague fatality rate that’s 30x-60x higher COVID. nothing wrong encouraging re-opening 20%+ population, including many vulnerable, received least one dose vaccine. Vaccination occurring rate 2M people per day, rising. Plus many people already natural herd immunity. buy ridiculous amounts fear mongering, constantly bombarding people daily basis last 12 months. sure getting data would encourage double check, probably unintentionally blending facts fiction comment 7 day average 2.44M. Given Monday Tuesday slow days, imagine we’ll end week 2.5M keep going forward. made appt Kaiser Monday last week vaccinated Thursday. Bay Area. I’m 65 occupation newly able go. Environmentalists celebrating people dying COVID kinda meh. Honestly I'm emotionally exhausted, empathy spare 

We really need pollute planet send message people glorifying COVID. okay apparently saying color isn’t allowed. Anyway, trying say think year isolation redditing made little naive rest population doing. 

I started working fun, popular area city. Everyone wears mask part, things pretty much back normal. Restaurants, bars, shops bumpin’. salon &amp; spa (my workplace) busy. I’m smelling social end pandemic. really warms up, it’s over. give masks mid-summer start disappearing. 

I received first shot today, I’ll joining real soon. It’s refreshing public contributing society again.

Everyone, please get first vaccine available you, keep following precautions bit. We’re home stretch. Yeah account huge difference. implying US really sticking two dose, 3-4 week schedule UK loose it. think would prefer UK's approach, honest. US followed it, would like 40%+ Americans least protection right (not including natural immunity). guess year ago lot unknown concerns within past month we’ve seen generally good news (US wise anyway) regarding vaccinations. We’re potentially home stretch easier optimistic! could make sense immune disorder. vaccine may jolting proper immune response.

The scenario could help reservoirs active virus helping body keep bay. don’t know fuck PA 

And cases going hospitals friends work at. Vaccine rollout absysmal know Nordics, believe France would: imagine restrictions quintuple fatality rate hospitals would've running space.

So number like 7.5 million dead americans. least. always laugh too, feel like hypocrite use plane go vacation. lol never jealous Ohio life, moment. I'm sure, look percentage vaccinated right par ahead many states (22% one dose, 12.5% fully vaccinated whereas Ohio 20.9% 12.2%). assume must large number people open categories want vaccine. maybe kind distribution supply problem near future we'll start falling behind states soon.  Need people give shots. Need also open floodgates &amp; let anyone get vaccine. So, might make bucks later, maybe, based speculation.

I'm seeing changes created profit motive. Cmon Washington state! Let's go! donated yesterday. It’s figured I’ll probably get first dose weeks figure there’s pretty much chance know whether antibodies. Meanwhile Pennsylvania there’s 3 places get vaccine 65 It’s tragic. politician Alabama died saying wrong messaging take COVID seriously. older 54 it’s point. I'll probably pass realize going on.

Unless that’s already implying! Finland small country, investment needed 30-50 million € nothing, definitely unfortunate they've able get full funding. 
 
I tried link article choice private actors Jacobin allowed apparently reliable source, interested google it. Ayyy, apart 1.6 Million, got first Pfizer shot last night like 8:45 called people come leftover doses. why? $15 antibody test whereever simpler donating blood? legitimate lol remember shut state moat states realize Russia vaccine powerhouse decades, right? that’s problem here. Appointments going unused. states opened levels people needed vaccines refusing them. we’re talking 7 day average 4M, probably late April early may general population starts become vaccinated. This. 

Most drug stores/grocery stores booking 1-3 days out, wal-mart week. healthcare systems 2-5 days out. Ah! Thanks. 1.6 million AZ vaccinations Germany alone, 7 cases - I'd thought EU wide, hence confusion. 

Do know many AZ vaccinations given across whole European Union? add German numbers, would seem may well case average lower thought, since, presumably, Euro wide figure AZ vaccinations double Germany whilst number people disease elsewhere EU less - 5 believe.

Not matters more: stories today politicising decision plus statements EMA benefits AZ vaccine far outweigh risks make clear danger much vaccine perception vaccine Europe. great pity EU - especially Pfizer started rub hands together thought significantly increasing price vaccine. But, (selfish) point view, looks like AZ vaccine continued used UK little danger vaccination programme halted. Meaning, bit luck, may free restrictions July.

Hopefully, even without AZ allowing delays political decision make timescale, EU also clear scourge sometime soon. think interesting thing different two approaches been. US 22% one dose 12% fully vaccinated. UK 37% one dose 2% fully vaccinated. That's crazy difference strategy. think move it? Probably someone lumping Europe together. could worse—you could Canadian waiting vaccines Meanwhile Florida pay win. think overwhelming majority “still can’t find appointment” complaints made people refuse anything can’t schedule phone less 10 minutes driving  scope

Had look up. haha

Yep, sleeping giant finally awakened. We're goin' D-day virus now. Same. Right you. UK rate actually higher Pfizer AZ (but still lower you’d expect population vaccinated). believe 220 million. scheduled 100mil Pfizer upper 120mil. Unless missed Moderna well.... agree. Honestly would give children MNRA vaccine would want see long term effects study (5 10 years) otherwise needs old technology shown vaccines long term effects. 

That’s personally, young anything pops 5 10 years could really lower quality life. 

I’m sure work safe today idea long term affects are. rumor infertility enough make wanna wait kids. study released said HVP vaccine showing signs causing infertility issues, took 15 years realize. able bodied adult trained administer vaccine. think local governments need train emergency responders vaccination sites every town, think federal government train national guardsmen send around country they're needed.

I able walk CVS location country next two months without seeing someone getting vaccine. read people able find appointments. Distribution outpacing administration long, needs corrected. Brits really going die hill vaccine

Actually looks like many European citizens going die hill due vaccinated. Meanwhile, UK complete non issue. ~3500 people dying day EU Covid, increasing, dying Covid every couple minutes *possible* AZ connected deaths. 0 confirmed. CVS let's select 2 different locations 1st 2nd dose appointments. coronavirus scam it’s certainly overblown media controlled Looking data states without mask mandates looking data vaccine schedules concluding start lifting mandates make someone virus denier.

Lots people able adapt new data see cases plummeted recent months, happened regardless local policies. People subreddit better-informed average person since actively look new information instead pretending still March 2020 need bleach groceries. 

Demanding keep mandates 90% population vaccinated spite data coming reopened states I'd call ""denial."" disagree you, think really stupid people want wear masks. 

I also believe government constitutional authority impose penalties wearing article clothing agree lifting mandates.

The two mutually exclusive. think someone wrong without using threat violence (government mandate) force others behave way believe behave. bought everything allotted Joint Procurement Scheme got opportunity. Commission done lot wrong, squarely Member States complaining unfairness. Honestly probably could. went state run site ask proof residency/working state pre-existing conditions. got vaccinate Making dumb profits scared people.Did anyone also notice new “variants” came soon started vaccination?They wanted rush people take it. investigations definitely warranted. comment mean ""IF"" saying 7 whatever # woman 40 rare condition? every 20/30 year old secure ps5/series X. follow twitter bots quick it.

Obesity enumerated. absence specific BMI number site, I'd go CDC's I’m 60 Kansas. Won’t able get vaccine June. Glad got yours, mom her's scheduled. great news.

For reason articles read talk overall vaccine specific batches.
If anyone good information specific batches manufacturing locations woukd great.

It quite sad question addressed clearly quickly.  is, fact, I'm doing. like essential shift workers. makes drag month longer. least. Community spread end vaccinating WFH crew. need get people community every day. Fellow Ohioan here; lowered eligibility 50, thought they'd keep least 2-3 weeks. Mom &amp; Dad got relatively easy, &amp; I'm hoping I'll able book appointment weekend Maybe vaccination ""growing"" exponentially e^-t Innate immune system doesnt really fight viruses get infected hope convince 100% states set date end month. setting date setting absurd date going make people disregard mandates first place.

There's lot people certain states feeling pretty hopeless, like restrictions never end. data saying vaccines work prevent spread, data saying there's gonna enough vaccines doses everyone barely two months. Set realistic date, move forward things go even better expected. make people think we'll still dealing statewide mask mandates July. Pfizer started rub hands together thought significantly increasing price vaccine.

Which trouble cheaper competing vaccines like AZ. Pfizer already 6x cost AZ. Theory almost always irrelevant real world doesn’t take account many factors. bring justification?

If really free market, ole person (you, I, disadvantaged kid grew inner city neighborhood) could easily prop pharma company compete big boys. would continue happen price settles fair market price.

Obviously case. It’s usually key couple companies able dictate price much capital control market. Every time small guy comes along try compete, big guys buy continue dictate market. Illinois delivered doses per 100K (22K Illinois vs. 20K Ohio, per 100K population). Advancing categories fast beyond availability puts people competition appointments. ideal -- people end even frustrated. got first dose Pfizer today. actually managed snag walgreens appointment yesterday 9:45 morning. mom appointment next Tuesday county. feels exciting.

Best way look metrics guess. also survey tests health ministry also data available public like age distribution every day many fully vaccinated people get infected. said days ago vast majority serious cases vaccinated almost rest got 1 shot. also said fully vaccinated people 4700 confirmed infected 900 symptoms. hate (the UK) government. there's statistical significance, there's statistical significance. Blowing lack evidence stupid idea Exactly, people still think private companies spend money bribing politicians. days flood public discourse messaging, electorate lot control actions politicians. I’m pretty sure it’s still soon. definitely soon Texas, believe ~7% population vaccinated restrictions lifted state level. That’s even close enough make difference. right time number starts falling: really good getting vaccines bodies even restrictions. means we're still track efficacious use vaccines. Obviously valuable get front line workers, old people etc shots people like - long we're wasting doses. right we're note. feel you.

I’m trying pick fight, please dismiss something “feel” discriminatory. It’s beyond condescending. I’m trying point policy harmful needlessly targets group people way others. I’m barking wrong tree, it’s I’m trying convince someone care something won’t affect all. good one. Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J supposed distrubuted total 240 million end march, thats almost 6.5 million day average rest month reach goals exact situation here... I’ve given trying convince them. Lol yeah. go far, I'm sure would work short time too. I'm saying Red areas getting vaccine, I've noticed red areas? Tons open appts. 


I got first shot last friday Cambridge. tech shots said mix 50% people coming Akron, rest Pennsylvania. many locals. 


I happen notice lot Trump flags still flying there. I'm saying there's correlation anything... great hearing friends family Virginia Pennsylvania getting shots, MD like nothing happening. guess move 1C recently, technically get Phase 2 might happen soon, come MD! Wait, matter? thought states getting doses allocated according population? suggestions viral fragments potential viral reservoirs (which happen diseases). quote 7-1 ratio.

Instant downvotes say anything even remotely narrative “everything’s normal US handling everything perfectly.” Waves PA. Hey neighbor. boat hopefully see neck woods soon. Click links provided /u/nubeasado \- UK government surprisingly open side effects - single side effect appeared vaccinated people would expected general population.

Stop guessing spreading bullshit start reading facts data provided comment. UK's strategy fully vindicated, get everyone half vaccinated start giving second doses 12 weeks they're going hard choice.

The US's vaccine production since invoked defense production act crazy. helps companies making vaccines US-based. That's like 15 20 million euro. 

It's dumb. agree long continue ramp vaccine availability. fail regard, variants going burn us like Europe. needs based something. cant stop whole vaccination bacause 20 20 million people died. trials different story. Much lower number people much less safe vaccine. people get vaccine safe is.

Right, totally get that’s places. making point it’s like everywhere. “jump line” am, you’re getting vaccinated protecting yourself, family, everyone come contact (which better society whole), also letting vaccine go waste, vast majority people age 65 underlying conditions already gotten vaccinated (or chose to). reduce side effects I'm in. second vaccine Moderna kicked ass curb back. rough 3 days man.....  use both. weren’t patronizing talked people like adults maybe people would listen more. kind crazy honestly lot us thought fall US could jabbed. like May 1st available, heartwarming. think Canada may experience similar rapid tracking gets going. EU issues AstraZeneca? 

If I’m mistaken Italy suspended seized 500k doses first. brexit related? done properly, going maskless tied vaccine via honor system. know everyone thinks lead masses unvaccinated people taking mask, think incorrect. People generally pretty compliant, despite auspicious cases people throwing fit throughout pandemic got disproportionate coverage. expensive take work, take kid doctor (who may may able perform rapid test), pay tests/prescriptions every time runny nose cough (I think parent would react fever I'm leaving one out)... Especially peak allergy season. get wrong, it, like government schools really done anything facilitate frequent accessible testing level could actually help teachers. 

As example, one little ones double ear infection clearing up. tested COVID three times last two weeks (all negative, 2 PCR) may still need keep home due accompanying cough even though otherwise fine. really amenable gainful employment.

That's herd immunity important - get infection rates low enough everyone protected, including can't vaccinated were, remain vulnerable. I'm pretty sure can't effective current version, end going one-shot might closer J&amp;J, think that's good idea. Ah rights absolute. 

Good know.

So Americans decide limits differ own, bad? 

Because Americans overwhelmingly support different set limits. No. whole thing ridiculous. harm good. guys finish vaccine program May probably send excess us get border reopened. UK variant. easier spread higher death rate. Yup. Luckily generally liberal Executive Legislative branches, still way powerful things outside scope. Good facing fears.

If makes feel better, know quite people gotten vaccinated extremely rare side effect. briefly mentioned it, brushed certain communities access.

One way hope determine events random not. sides claim ""following science"": dealing unknowns.

On one hand, worthless opinion reading much internets way handled causing harm good.

On hand, turns bad batch knows, caution justified.

Nobody wins either way... even 100 100,000. UK 28 24,000,000. Great idea cost lives dispensing said AstraZeneca vaccine safe benefit risk ratio jab “widely positive”. eight deaths four cases serious side-effects following vaccinations Italy, added.  lmao would’ve happened regardless buddy No, isn't. That's 100M people.

We even get half population vaccinated summer, meaning another lockdown winter. Apparently guidelines changed July last year eligible don’t see comment said anything derogatory toward overweight people. Simply said epidemic, true, majority people US overweight. I, one, think it’s fair verbally abuse overweight people, think deserve pitfalls come it. know people sensitive weight, diabetic sensitive blood sugar, don’t ignore blood sugar readings. I’m glad you’re making healthy choices YOU. That’s reason anyone make choices. belief Exposed percentage Way higher 20%. 

This backed ever changing cycles PCR figure whether one “infected” not. 

Basically, entire premise large majority country may NEVER get “infected” whether exposed not, math, never help Lower IFR CFR getting treated (per equation) live middle nowhere never exposed. [T cell responses remain longer reason think died vaccine... People dying vaccine mean died vaccine

Here Director Norwegian Medicines Agency emphasizes known whether vaccine anything blood clots. saying definitely have, says.

[Norwegian Medicines Agency criticizes AstraZeneca saying patently false. vaccine stopped precaution based recommendation medical agencies. Different priorities, different demographics Yeah sure economy whatever cares wtf antibody (part of) innate immune system. defense system thinking of, involve antibody?  vaccine distributed evenly states based population, still age 65 others ready open age 16 show used amount shipped allotment? waiting miracle. way people working entire year keep economy going. interation community, likely get spread it. want end thing? Stop prioritizing people left homes year. Vaccinating droves near meaningless actual spreaders innoculated. It’s Bloomberg making shitty headline.

The vaccines “better” don’t need cold storage, need one shot, don’t need needles mist patch.

Just awful headline. Yep headline incredibly misleading. 

Basically article: 

Health agencies mandate take measures **they** decided suspend vaccination AZ EU consensus results. Check comment history. you’ve completely failing pay attention whole time. 

If 20% US virus means IFR 0.8%, pretty much range people saying since last summer, actually higher CDC estimate. cannot get mad cow disease. rare cases may get human form mad cow disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), fatal. happen eat nerve tissue (the brain spinal cord) cattle infected mad cow disease. time, vCJD destroys brain spinal statement false. recorded proof Pfizer caused blood clots. clinical confirmation yet even report suggests accumulation special form rare CVT/SVT associated deficiency platelets bleeding. 

Thank you. read announced still far know clinical confirmation yet, although I'm sure know letting press release otherwise maybe would making statements powerful words like ""striking accumulations"" ""special forms "" ""very rare"" -- said EMA provide details later, learn There's huge criticism media PEI's decision Germany. independent institute advises politicians. say needs investigated resuming vaccinating again, politicians listen. Opposite would political decision even though would saved lives.

Surprised, expected would support it. thought perception AZ vaccine low there. I'm Germany agree decision. biggest fan situation handled overall way covered news places Europe. think many worried concerned media running hourly stories side effects rare outcomes, alternative nothing stories came countries help either pretty stuck anyhow. 

 PEI respectable organization expertise, gaggle morons, prudent investigate situation. Hopefully clarity come soon. Socialism makes everyone equally poor. study duration normal. like ourworldindata best, although 7-day average million. know whether still expand famous phase 3 trial. Search clinicaltrials it, usually official state like recruiting/active recruiting.

It's dynamic situation, depending knowledge virus, immune reaction, political influence lobby groups competitors, like Curevac delaying readout get cases new SA strain, Biontech/Pfizer expanding phase 3 trial late last year US identity politics.

In case, vaccine, many trials running parallel, many really known public. know recently new trials low- single-dose Biontech vaccine started, based largely unknown trials last year, found identical maybe even better titers 10 µg low-dose group. also recruit older younger people, people HIV, original protocol, extend approval R&amp;D.

Through failure governments people, freaking SARS running wild threatening becoming endemic. situation one choose 1:100000 safe ""let's wait bit longer"" approach, even fifteen year old low risk profile, orders magnitude. 

It go fast, main risk vaccination interaction spike protein immune system. risk nearly everyone living outside Asia face next months, repeatedly kinds new strains. I'd rather vaccine first, real virus, make process much controlled smaller, likely without carnage widespread infection destroying cells en masse letting kinds immune side effects run free. population US (age, etnicity) significantly different places. would also hesitate straight approve medicament US based (for example) data collected Italy, virtually asians afroamericans tested. means nearly %42 percent start gain immunity virus.

No, people virus vaccinated too. whole pandemic farce. Everyone already covid degree, vaccine. electromagnetic, virus, whole earth shifting, everyone feel way, nobody stop this, building years. globalists keeping people distracted consolidate everything next cycle. insomnia due excitement/anxiety (honestly can’t tell which) getting first shot vaccine Friday.

Just far lol Time factor here. 1 5 coming back positive now, know antibodies fade time, missing people earlier pandemic. say still immune, may detectable antibodies. Studies shown immunity extends beyond simple presence antibodies turns cells still work, like expected. Well no. choice experts listen fully political. Almost every expert said link stopping vaccination devastating mistake. 

Yet countries choose ignore experts.

It highly specialized [university special assignments research development new methods treatment. 

About 60% patients admitted Rikshospitalet referred hospitals Norway specialized investigations treatment. Norway, Rikshospitalet plays important part expert knowledge treatment rare complicated disorders.  Rikshospitalet covers whole country various fields,  got jnj shot yesterday feel miserable. First time I've sick probably 4 5 years. I'm extremely hot, freezing time head pounding. know normal side effects everyone gets, fuck suck. said, could go back I'm time, I'd get vaccine again. fauci says still really dangerous!!!! I've taken extremely high levels precaution virus still donate platelets every week two. claim it’s HIV risk BS. Either don’t really need blood they’re allowing bigotry rule policy. HIV tests pretty accurate let’s assume 1% false negative rate. Ok, policy testing blood gay men twice extra sure. would mean false negative rate 1:10,000. consider probability donor HIV+ high viral load. Let’s conservative say 10% chance (likely way lower). that’s 1:100,000 chance slip cracks. someone life death situation needed blood save would really turn perfectly fine blood might 1 100,000 chance HIV (a manageable disease btw) let person die? theory enough blood donors, don’t really need anyway. It’s rational decision, stats won’t help different point view comfort might enough support fearful person get vaccinated. couple healthy young people dying vaccine suddenly insignificant

You reason think died vaccine... People dying vaccine mean died vaccine. company literally every single regulatory agency made determion far said, vaccine perfectly safe zero reason conclude vaccine anything blood clots. one critisizing regulators investigating. suspension vaccine definitely worthy critisism. I'm baffled since regardless ""oddness"" incidents question, numbers still tiny compared number doses given countries. 

That said... think average doctor qualified make determination here. Like rest us, average doctor access data, specifics cases raising eyebrows. 

I'm big data analytics, years focused life sciences sector. first client engagement develop iPad app used pharma sales reps (you know, cute 22 year old brings brochures takes fancy steak dinner?). app analyzed given target doctor's prescribing habits vs colleagues, figuring work variety means providing sales rep nice dashboard. would empower rep conversations like ""hey, see colleague Dr. Gupta prescribing xxx condition yyy...have seen latest studies blah blah.""

Bottom line is, AVERAGE doctor time motivation first-hand research critically review studies. get guidelines summaries...often provided Pharma companies. Couple (at least USA) various ways Pharma companies bribe doctors...such free trips seminars, dinners, etc, basically Pharma companies able push medications want prescribed...often suitable generic alternatives. Interesting. restate, totally agree case, average GP statistician data scientist. conclusions come may slightly better informed average redditor... absence able analyze data directly grounds make informed decision. someone kind analysis living, access powerful ML-based tools really good finding patterns... I'm also qualified make decision either way simply data either. agreement based gut feel point. side effects? Feel anything after? mild case COVID right started March 2020. several antibody test done come back positive. Last one got 2 weeks ago—almost ONE YEAR original infection.  dont know county in. know site Kean college go put name in. end day free doses call come it. know county bet sites like that. heard even shop rite makes announcement every days saying x available doses wants wrapping up. That's different we're talking then. They're free everywhere imagine. overreaction immune system may general increase risk thrombosis. Covid cause that, maybe vaccines, rare cases. completely unthinkable correlation, especially given lot people react quite strongly first shots Astrazeneca vaccine. 
All thrombosis cases happened soon astrazeneca vaccinations aware happened rather young people. good move half dose first shot people 55? getting half doses accident vaccine evaluated, seemed even efficacious cases, least safe say less efficacious. half dose regime initially rejected good data people 55. least 55 could get half dose probably lower risk strong immune system reaction. Plus, could vaccinate people, given reduced deliveries. Norway AZ vaccine used mainly vaccinate health workers weird. well duh, america didnt close down. guys let whole population get infected. think one two things happen.

- People probably keep posting becomes weird like “general chat” kind place

- mods close sub down, daily thread stop auto-posting, etc (we’ll encouraged leave)

You’re right. Coming become part daily ritual year now. can't catch break! too. didn’t grow Europe, apparently lived long wrong time. check guidelines every couple years, hoping they’ll get rid rule. live NNJ, would take entire day per shot that's doable unfortunately. Can't go work sick days, NJ still give enough PTO, need wait end contract summer want travel. Roaring 20s baby heard Anders Tegnell said, he's describing exactly we've seen Norway, Denmark Germany. Search thrombosis (blood clot vessel) embolism (bloot clot veins arteries). Covid Vaccines Coming, WHO’s Chief Scientist Says

Jeez hope statements like reduce rate individuals coming vaccinate going year. people still believing conspiracies now, it’s want to. AZ caused thousands deaths falling dramatically short agreed upon delivery targets? really. natural immunity still, I'm healthy fit.

Eat well, sleep well, good. need vaccination here, although believe useful different group people.  (Reuters) - German coronavirus infections spreading exponentially, 20% last week, expert Robert Koch Institute infectious diseases said Tuesday, adding risk AstraZeneca’s vaccine relatively low. Merkel state leaders agreed phased easing curbs earlier month along “emergency brake” let authorities reimpose restrictions case numbers rise 100 per 100,000 three consecutive days. Germany Monday suspended use AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, making latest several European countries hit pause following reports blood coagulation disorders recipients. UK literally two orders magnitude data Norway point. many cases? Ok guess really know talking then, considering thousands people making way Sweden throughout year boats. Sweden much traveled timing February vacation (in Stockholm region) later neighbours started much higher caseload. 

From observed, socially pretty similar Dutch Swedes, guess arnt really people person then? maybe younger generation becoming social? never actually around Swedes? 

Ok think best comparison made Sweden countries 1/4 weighted density? people always think Scandinavian countries 3 copy's themselves? 

I personally think could acted faster restrictions fault anyone fully locking down, considering middle pack Europe, even obsessive way count covid deaths, call failure. say thing get downvoted oblivion accused anti-science pointing unscientific decision making countries getting fucked AZ, Moderna soon J&amp;J things would go lot smoother. say planned, said actions make seem like it. like fuck literally every part, seems almost purpose bad is. Throat nose ones say thing get downvoted oblivion accused anti-science pointing unscientific decision making countries pretty weird seeing well respected, leftish, generally pro-EU news sources like Guardian, BBC Channel 4 News get derided 'Evil British Tabloids' continental brethren last days, going lie. risk sub-par production vaccines cause massive problems though. public started dying statistically significant numbers poor quality vaccines new problem . Exactly. understand it, UK got 8 million vaccine doses EU *in total*, Pfizer/BioNTech. say thing get downvoted oblivion accused anti-science pointing unscientific decision making countries. schools I've seen still offer meals even closed still call everyday donate? That’s fear. referring vaccine passports? EU decided recognize vaccines approved EMA, vehemently disagree with, people world can't even get hands EMA approved vaccines. Definitely huge number people can't. ones get Sputnik V, Chinese vaccines AZ countries, although there's possibility EMA revokes approval AZ, there's too. decision would discriminate people get vaccinated EMA approved vaccines simply get hands them.

Now, Sputnik V expected approved soon (month, 2 months whatever), people taking probably problems. That's logic circular. start assumption vaccine need checked recent reports. 

That's old atheist fallacy. God exists therefore afterlife, means God. Planned governnent? *All* together?

Because read article UK government response tell straight incompetence lack appreciate delicate issue, think countries significant number people get ‘facts’ Facebook groups. guarantee even U.K. plenty people refuse AZ vaccine fear blood clots. 


But would argue governments outright stopped AZ rollout acted far strongly, much early. followed science said ‘We immediately halting batch carrying urgent investigation, evidence AZ vaccine dangerous’ would let people know take seriously, avoid spreading false idea AZ vaccine caused blood clots.


I believe amount people blood clots vaccine actually lower would get surveyed random group amount (17 million people). possible logic saying link? I’m genuinely baffled reaction, especially since countries already issues misinformation lack trust vaccines. understand you’re saying - governments probably afraid population turn look like ignoring this. Unfortunately case good government right thing reduce deaths population, instead taking easier route pandering irrational beliefs. really cruel. get flamed pissed it, better someone gets vaccinated one, say. Wait bro, elderly folk know we're trying every day getting appt, opened three times since. could waited couple weeks right older folks healthcare workers. NJ made pretty clear priority. 

Just like gave week half dumped huge group head. I've given times being. get one less competition. Now? Ha. priority upper class people sit computer refreshing day long. surprised? husband qualified 2021 race Oct 2019 he’s thinking one few. Hopefully plus fact New York Chicago run right around time enough get people qualified in. Even 'it happens', still reach assume prison guards refusing get vaccinated evil master plan infect minority-filled prisons. That's conspiracy theory shit. exactly. reports mentioning usual blood clots PEI (in Germany) investigating increased number sinus vein thrombosis/ cerebral venous thrombosis + lack platelet extremely rare, happen 3-4 times per million per year.

There case Sinus vein thrombosis resulting cerebral hemorrhage even J&amp;J US trial, (that's trial paused October) sample size thousands vaccinated. Ultimately ruled FDA connection vaccine related individuals pre-existing Even though normal blood clots usual, not. 7 1.6m people encounter 3 possible deaths, reasons concern according PEI. 

AFAIK clinical confirmation yet even SVT, could also something else like ITP-- sample size large, would expect even uncorrelated events vaccine related adverse events pop sort frequency, know covid associated thrombotic events (incidence rate suggested roughly 25% hospitilazed patients) low platelets reported earlier chinese researchers clinical reports present around 35% covid patients, observed delayed onset 

Low platelets ( immune thrombocytopenia ) popped several times connection covid vaccines too; example here's article last month talks 36 reported cases US one death (out 30 million vaccinations). got attention furore all, rightfully. think course prudent investigate, want point Nobody's telling UK vaccinate. Plus UK makes AZ. imports Pfizer suspended.  official data available US many people received Moderna vaccine hospitalized died Covid variants (UK, South Africa, Brazil)? I’ll partying like it’s 1999 high school would blood drives couple times year seniors participate lot teachers gave extra credit students it. first time got someone obviously new it.

My mom pissed said want anymore. ended next semester needed extra credit class struggling in. Everything went smoothly, pain bruising all. I've donated blood couple times work hosted drives went smooth too. one guy europe saying that? I'm discounting says hand, starting become notable he's one saying it. Thank you! :) Australia get party pies, sausage rolls, cookies, cheese crackers, potato chips, flavoured milk, juice.. sit lounge area take much want! good.

It’s much trait sociopath trait teenager. wonder vacine good enough granted entry countries. list developed antibodies innate immune system fought off.  Spite great motivator. Double check later. first stories bit frenetic. official policy Ohio Covid site tomorrow. literally exact thought. bad press AstraZeneca currently getting, may take longer expected.

It matter. Even ema saying eu countries wrong. Time difference. responsible institute talks last two weeks. beginning March, Astra ramped deliveries significantly. Perhaps, remember English talking point two weeks ago, Germany hoarding vaccines vaccinating fast enough new supplies.

The latest English report covers events 28th February. Pfizer 'are having' similar numbers blood clots.

Nothing similar reported Pfizer Moderna Norway. Norwegian Medicines Agency saying press release: *The three serious incidents involving blood clots, bleeding low platelet counts seen following vaccination AstraZeneca vaccine far observed vaccination coronavirus vaccines.*

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.


Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something... side effects vaccine:

Nobody saying side effects. clearly side effects. I'm even saying side effects vaccine could last years. effects infection may show while, [and know last long notably loss sense smell.

I'm saying we'd find side effects within months. side effects suddenly show six months vaccination already shown people.

If example side effect vaccine side effects seen within first four months suddenly found four months post-vaccination, I'd change wording post.

I'll tell though, I've still gotten example vaccine side effect show least people way vaccine administered.

I get plenty ""look, vaccine used decades ago tiny country rarely causes one long-term side effect, wrong"", address point I'm making. can't donate blood work. tried blood stopped flowing halfway donation. took like hour get blood flowing first place. threw got said enough usable sample. still felt effects donating blood days. fun experience.

Even logical. It’s like train track conundrums. 24 way 10m shots 32 10m Maybe one of, fifth six attack vaccine (they come delivery updated involves short delivery), going hard convince people safe, that's OK EU take attention away shortage caused poor procurement. one cares tear kids foreskin without consent might well get two one They're brushing scientific sub. brush there's definitive/concrete proof. necessarily mean general population concerned 1 half million vaccines 7 people getting blood clots. That's 0.000004375%. statistics alone, that's less adverse reactions required vaccine shots people get. concrete evidence, know supply bad batches vaccine, something went wrong mid way, etc etc. There's many unknown variables could happened unrelated effects vaccine perhaps vaccine that's problem. taking seriously enough investigate makes look like coverup dangerous today's climate people seemingly untrusting anything mortality rate Astrazeneca administration vs many dead expect 2 week pause vaccinations.

For Norway two week pause AZ vaccinations lead vaccination program delayed days. due low amount doses AZ capable send us moment.

If AZ vaccine paused months even stopped lead delay vaccination program I’m 33 y/o 31 BMI lol. fairness, Ohio date chosen purely spite Michigan. exactly. government loves fund pet projects give kickbacks future generations going left holding bag. that's sad part.

The EMA currently investigating serious cases recommends rollout continues. 

You shared article referring clinical trials last year suspending vaccine result thousands potential deaths. way going outdone Michigan! :) That's true. anyone wants enter move within EU. already posted Reposts removed. half overall vaccine supply going unused.

 I'm sick Oh, I'm saying variants conspiracy anything. I'm pointing media suddenly fixed focus soon vaccines announced. existed well media starting making big story. Yes. are. California entered red tier. Dine back , vaccines keep
Going up. Supply keeps going up. Go home fauci , you’re drunk. AZ hasn’t grossly incompetent. Please don’t spread that. EU failed it’s procurement trying blame shift.  Cant wait follow story Europeans refusing AZ vaccine this. Well done Eu governments really played baller aim stoke anti-vax base little evidence. case since start AZ. simple, trust science. That’s less case since last summer anyway. never really big shutdown past May border's closed since March 21, 2020. LAST YEAR. Total bullshit. 

Especially considering seven scientific organizations urging suspension today, including one discovered entire SARS family begin with. 

What fuck populism anyway and, since institutions like RKI PEI involved politics. 

Why telling blatant untruths? Well agree, Lula terrible too. took even higher first dose Israel started dropping, give time mention stress hospital system reduced dramatically past couple months, huge impact death rates. I'm 48 got first dose last week Texas. next time see local vaccination event town, go ask return see left over. 445pm, ton extra. trouble getting one. is/isn’t it’s Governor. lymph node thing good, right? way efficacy works 72% efficacy mean 72% lower chance getting virus, vaccinated people 72% lower risk getting COVID-19 compared control group participants, vaccinated. I'm going math I'm expert stuff would somewhere around less 1% people, vaccinated trial, got covid.

Also requires one shot need vaccination clinic 50% less time, protection starts (suspected) 2x fast vaccines require shot. also dangerous time pandemic (post vaccine release) protection faster also going make bigger difference way (as likely come contact covid carriers, people covid)

LTDR: best option COVID vaccine whatever vaccine get first. Getting faster going massively outweigh slight differences vaccines.

Keep mind get another vaccine future turns going dealing COVID long-ass time. Nobody knows long protection lasts vaccines. far know J&amp;J longest lasting protection. ""Shut down"" want drive wide open want fly Vegas Hawaii right freedom speech, like reply. America also 3rd world crime ridden dump sad. That's happens rush vaccines, really hope american ones turn completely safe. lots friends familly members get already No. fine discretion store. I'm referring fact everything right reopen dictate safety measures. Yes though may around 1.9 tomorrow Tuesdays lower Mondays. really naive enough ignore way stories undermine public trust vaccines? can't flip switch remove lasting impression accusations people's minds. Hence much EU already issues AZ vaccine acceptance. Canada border closed ...   
Mexico border open ...   
makes sense ....what? Yeah best way would say possible link allow people still get investigating. 

There people EU health issues make extremely likely die get bad case Covid can’t isolate months. people would probably rather risk clots catching Covid.  literally evidence back decisions. 

Hence, must ulterior motive. vaccination might mean nothing 

How so? still get infected. know lot people virus twice. safe true rural areas also? I'll getting first dose Pfizer closed event school district Thursday. (Second dose scheduled April 9th, second dose closed event)

But definitely good know J&amp;J vaccine going really help fill gaps, vaccines. getting lot J&amp;J vaccines week one less person possibly could take ICU bed, that's meaningful anywhere USA. could connection AZ vaccine blood clots -- kind doubt it, obviously careful things. Here's one strong opinion this:

**There one listening anything politics medicine intersect; be.** They've proven always choose political solution scientific one. last year taught us one thing, that. thats inaccurate since fema alone got $50 billion vaccine cdc also got several billion distribute vaccine top $16 billion mentioned Thanks double checking. true 3 workers one sadly died. I'm reasonably sure point searching around (including various reputable norweigan media) fact 3 people fell sick hospital, people fell sick independent places later admitted hospital (Oslo University Hospital) that's probably confusion stems from, coupled dubious translation. No, that's far think. sick wear mask, that's all.  ""Super-weird low platelet thing"" = ""immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)"".  pops rarely associated vaccines including influenza, MMR recently AstraZeneca, Pfizer Moderna covid vaccines. said, pops similar numbers without vaccine solid causal link found.

I totally agree assessment. Cool, free market shown time time create mass inequality.

Because people massively different capabilities understand, highly offensive call people ""illegals,"" people also logic. called everyone jaywalked ""illegal,"" word would useless.

But even hate intentionally want demean people, logic vaccinating plenty sound. still transmit disease, since they're less likely go doctor various systemic reasons, they're likely transmit it. protect people ""pay taxes"" (which way, undocumented immigrants pay taxes even without benefitting them), good idea vaccinate everyone.  I’m still astounded Ohioan myself. feel hopeful. It’s long time since felt like lol two weeks news agency publishes EMA Health Organ Member State European Union neglected potential contamination certain batch. 

You created many new anti-vaxxer accept scientific evidence new batch safe 'that one batch March also 100% safe'. 

So might die people short term. news agency finds governmental body surprised information contamination certain covid vaccine batch. never, ever hit 70% vaccinated people.

This temporally halt convincing anti-vaxxers. ensuring minimum amount new people jump anti-vax train. Pfizer? mean Biontech. developed vaccine funded German tax money.

The vaccine developed Pfizer money, German tax money. joint venture Pfizer BioNTech. Please stop posting falsehoods. 

**Back April 2020**, Pfizer BioNTech announced partnership Pfizer paid 100% development costs. Agreement Germany comes **September 2021, time already successful candidate** conducting late stage trials. German money spent actual development vaccine, Pfizer money.

Any German money BioNTech may received vaccine went ""market authorization"" (applying license) manufacturing facilities (which came online back February 2021). 
Source 1 (April already started working Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine pleased announce details ongoing collaboration, **which reflects companies’ strong commitment move quickly bring safe efficacious vaccine patients worldwide,” says Co-Founder CEO BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, terms agreement, Pfizer pay BioNTech $185 million upfront payments, including cash payment $72 million equity investment $113 million. BioNTech eligible receive future milestone payments $563 million potential total consideration $748 million. Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine.**

Source 2: September funding important contribution **accelerate development scaling-up COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities Germany.** highlights tremendous importance mission efficiently find lasting solution control pandemic,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO Co-founder BioNTech.

So German money used factory Marburg developing vaccine.

The non-profit vaccine sold cost requirement Oxford University developed would agree partnership pharmaceutical company. profit pandemic. Continue cost low income after. Middle high income pay Oxford getting share profits reinvest R&amp;D. 

The EU’s vaccine roll failed multiple reasons, mainly isn’t area expertise good things (as you’d expect given organisation many member states) agile often able take quick decisions. parents worry every year kids get flu get seriously ill? No, don't.  COVID19 presents fraction risk children compared flu, hardly ""gamble""... Wow Ohio finally something right once! transfer second dose appointment one pharmacy another? able schedule appointment soon Ohio period time second dosage would obligations 5 hours away I'd still able go place Ohio would hassle go way back vaccinated. know Ohio mass regional vaccination sites maybe there'll infrastructure this? less fortunate people inuding children become ill potentially die simultaneously adding incredible debt hospitalizations raising costs due write offs profit healthcare system raise $100 $1000 premiums continue rise due Healthcare maintenaing profitably. Eventually able afford charge either.... care point, like homegrown antivaxxers parroting blood clot bullshit facebook.

This reaction hurts everyone. would rather higher taxes

The UK pays less per capita tax healthcare US does.

In US pay point use :( Except...Pfizer carrying backs. True, Pfizer wouldnt vaccine weren’t biontech, would ZERO biontech vaccines distributed weren’t Pfizer’s mass capabilities Literally nobody saying axe things.

Wasn’t sore yesterday. Kinda weird. feel safe performing intimacy vaccinated, even others vaccinated yet? could say ***short***\-sighted.

&amp;#x200B;

German joke. Kurz means short. Well, no, depends mean major spike. cases go down, yes. remember takes weeks new cases make hospitalizations. 

It take PhD see going zero completely open taking rate spread consideration. take informed step, two weeks later take another informed step, etc. 

All opening done, far, Republican-run states...and know why. Businesses constituents, random 55 year old vaccinated end long tail last covid-19 victims.

They even pretend give shit, part new politics take pigheadedness new heights. adverse reaction.

The percentage people getting blood clots AZ people havent gotten it. Foul play?

Three people Norway younger following similar patterns national rollouts, people 20s/30s getting vaccine likely people medical field work vulnerable people. hospital suggests relatively close geographically. Could doses mishandled purpose? imagine crazy anti-vaxxer sabotaging vaccine hopes something like would happen - true believers vaccine really bad people - sort like similar motive people bomb abortion clinics.

Feel though I'm veering conspiracy theory territory though. scientist. dont money. promote science, whole. pursuit knowledge. please, scientists dont vaccine stand make money. corperate executives shareholders companies stand benefit. Someone it. Always ask: me, who? everyone asked question, we'd live much better world. Ok, admit it. figured out.

It's secretive cabal major pharmaceutical companies, Blackpool chamber commerce board JD Wetherspoons, conspiring make sure Brits able go Benidorm summer holidays year.

This one goes way top. Better careful - *they* now... 100% beat Michigan love lol San Diego opened nearly everyone,
BMI 25 covers lot people along items added.

There also way actually check health condition, anyone willing lie get shot. like campaign vax started data confusing continued baby underlying conditions might consider it. son bit older heart problems (runs family) offered we’d definitely consider it. really turned 1.5 million doses - literally cost nothing? Even 10 times expensive sensible person wealthy country would turn doses.  Antibodies aren’t everything. T-Cell B-Cell immunity dominates covid immunity body right, concede. still think difference small enough margin error, especially considering vague yellow card system is. live Florida. area, people still wear masks, enforced social pressure case every bar, restaurant, hotel, store mandatory. suppose counterpoint would we're really making fly. right cases/100k number? concerned cases all? ICU %? whole country basically baseline right now. deaths? That's tricky number too.

I suppose one trackable % vaccinated, even fraught assumptions may bear fruit.

Most governors probably letting intrepid states dry run following behind cover since first.

Also, even metrics general juiced say whatever governors anyways. Texas could easily pulled together numbers (or even called forecasted numbers) justify complete reopening. everyone thread short-sighted? scientific decision, calculated stab AZ.

Say nothing halted vaccinations continue. anti-vaxx idiots mighty strong argument wanting get vaccinated. halted short amount time enough investigations problem, argument lot weaker.

It's one hundred thousand chance get problems. making sure people trust vaccine. There's many need sort incentive companies continue research/development vaccines we’ll fucked next pandemic.

We'd fine, think Canadian friends able vaccinate population later summer. month ago thinking I'd vaccinated October, early vaccine rollout problems. last month promising, I'm thinking we'll reach saturation June. first dose- Pfizer also- Saturday. Within two minutes, extreme mouth watering. time ever right barf. really nauseated several hours, took Motrin 3 hr nap. Woke felt better night. Arm swollen yesterday morning, back normal lunch. I've never reaction anything like that. I'm 40's relatively good health allergies seasonal, little disconcerting. Hopefully one taking shortcuts process order expedite things.

Good point, given blazing speed AZ supplying vaccines EU. Well that's they're looking tell us isn't. utter nonsense. People die time sorts shit. Someone struck lightning getting jab you’ll say “but can’t prove WASNt vaccine!” Thailand resumed AZ probably like me. real skinny fat whole life year. six feet tall still look healthy 140 bones tiny. Well, CDC thinks enough.  interpretation things don’t effect people often likely effect Mississippi vaccinated 600,000 people 3 million population. According website...rounded up.

of course 3 million even eligible recommended vaccine..kids etc.

The mask mandate lifted week ago.

CVS,Walmart,Krogers .Walgreens, drive thrus, state run vax sites, clinics pharmacies many private medical providers vaccinating. impressed truly using every avenue possible. Except heard anything home visit vaccines, Well started late well, let's say lifestyle bit slower much Europe. Takes longer get anything done. Europe bad meant also AZ + something else = thrombosis, something else common Europe. something else genes, food, medicines people take on. well need time get back stage shape that's mean. course would need rehearse learn new dances new shows. Many moved im guessing casts March intact. believe 6ft even enough point going need pop-up locations low vax areas. New Zealand Australia pretty well looked.  early (2002) they're still making episodes believe   What? going miss mask filling sweat wonderful feeling waterboarding yourself? source that, actually heard opposite back (around time discussions AZ effectivveness elderly) really looked time. think explanation difficult handling Biontech/Pfizer would easier use medical professionals. Yeah, wonder much political, counter backlash got dropping madk mandate. They're basically saying ""Hey, anyone worried get vaccinated snyway what's big deal""? Deine Aussage zu den Blutgerinnseln wiederum ist entweder bloß ignorant oder gar bewusst du hast bewusst unterschlagen, wie die beschaffen sind.

Unehrliche Unterstellungen.

Ich bleibe weiterhin der Ansicht, dass ein komplettes Aussetzen der Impfungen eine ungünstige Idee ist und würde - ganz konstruktiv - eine offizielle Warnung bzgl. eventueller Nebenwirkungen und zeitweilige medizinische Überwachung Geimpfter vorschlagen. Wir können es uns sowohl wirtschaftlich als auch menschlich nicht leisten, den Impfprozess noch weiter zu verzögern.

Ich werde nicht weiter meine Zeit mit Streitereien verschwenden. Du hast deine Ansicht, ich habe meine. Und wenn beide Ansichten nicht zusammen passen, ist es eben so.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 4 days 1st second dose? not. Pfizer issues well media hasn’t loud it. feel like negative press AstraZeneca extreme unfair.  That's exactly thought.  


They utter fucking gall spread massive amounts misinformation... move keep safe remote/at home working environments.  


WTF Good hear! suspect I’ll feel much better tomorrow :) honestly can’t complain anyways I’m fortunate vaccinated virus I’m sure would much much worse wonder numbers NYC report case without getting test? I'm aware reporting covers anything besides official test results. know sure. see not. USA need scapegoat anyone incompetent vaccine rollout, all... two months convincing enough arguments hold two months. “We almost enough data vaccines kids” variants picks. 

At point, point now, it’s time acknowledge vulnerable vaccinated, hospitals won’t collapse, we’ve given enough lives. mid-sized headache little 24 hours started 6 hours getting shot grandpa gets second vaccine soon. sister law fully vaccinated. brother, nephew, parents go first one week. And, go next Monday.

Really takes lot stress away all. It’s already two weeks. many batches two weeks willing wait admitting maybe Texas okay? Janssen still sent delivery schedule EU, implied they're likely miss targets too. Though lot fill-finish issue production problems, understand. less half actually COVID related. good bill ass. could still anyway, without making things worse slowing vaccination investigate issues. already excuse UK US aren’t sharing vaccines/exporting. AZ already missed contractual targets. far tell, EU public already firmly side governments exporting AZ contractual issues. distraction already worked, don’t see EU would need bolster argument intentionally making vaccine programs fall even behind. want transport 100% custom made housing unit, need buy $1,000 attachable premium wheels. Lmao call investigative journalism? actually investigative journalism would known suspension vaccine germany recommended scientists germany. q decision Merkel somehow distract issues.

Edit: read Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI), Federal Institute Vaccines Biomedicines, Langen near Frankfurt/Main senior federal authority reporting Federal Ministry Health (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG). responsible research, assessment, marketing authorisation biomedicines human use immunological veterinary medicinal products. remit also includes authorisation clinical trials pharmacovigilance, i.e. recording evaluation potential adverse effects. share them, could go wrong?  think state reopen without restrictions right now, Wyoming probably best candidate so. Texas hand... Got mine cvs, check single thing Stop politicizing it. want improve international relations politicizing well. Exactly - that's pretty much napkin math, since access exact delivery dates amounts, let's say given above, blocking exports necessary, manufacturers keep delivering regular intervals, people vaccinated single dose June – easily.

The EU might get AZ doses UK plants soon fulfill obligations towards UK government, EMA might also approve SII plants India get Oxford jabs there; US picture, believe – Curevac Novavax possible, viral circulation point low, think restrictions lifted summer anyway. :)

Indeed! long vaccinations keep happening, cases spike third wave, people protected – soon people 50-60+ chronically ill safe, we'll start returning normal. ;) Really? 


 I'd say began certain someone hid news deadly transmissible is, continued lie every aspect virus pandemic entire rest time office. long Covid seems psychosomatic lot people 

How so? Gathering I’ve reading, seems like folks take longer clear viral loads bodies, isn’t uncommon. Additionally, many viruses bacteria stick around bodies, like chicken pox (shingles), Lyme disease, HIV, etc. even thought play role autoimmune diseases like MS.

e: it’s practically common knowledge things like disease inflammation impact brain function. Looks like instead candy Easter I'm getting vaccines 😎 actually way way that. order get top 90 percent age group (with qualifying time another valid marathon) raise 10k charity. Getting Boston normal year extraordinarily difficult, year gonna borderline impossible. donate frequently, hate robocalls.

If want blood bad, please respect time use predictive dialer leaves waiting operator connect *you* call *me*. younger healthier are, likely strong side effects, immune system stronger.  Take headline handful salt!

This sounds like finding virus mucus saliva reason. read article, detected virus blood deep lung samples, presumably still via PCR test. *so* many details lacking article hard draw conclusions.

I'm *wildly* speculating, I'm wondering patients infections time either. phlebotomist phrased as: well, least know can’t heroin left arm... Thanks answering.
Hmm, partially get it.
Follow question : Lets say q fever virus entered body day 1. get symptoms day 3, symptoms disappear day 10. happens day 10? place read detail phase? (After symptoms disappear) ? feeling lot virus deniers moved in, concerned adults moved sub. specific parts bill like? risks still lower risks dying COVID 10 year olds. COVID risks low young people, even lower. also look historical pandemics. likely first time we've vaccinated pandemic. Spanish flu eventually became non-issue enough population exposed extent developed protection. U.S. 30 million ""confirmed"" cases. CDC estimates could 3x more. Red Cross put numbers saying 1 5 donatations antibodies. 

I think herd immunity nuber need hit. hospitals operating normally, severe cases fairly low, deaths low see we'd need maintain restrictions. personally think, fully re-opening keeping mask mandate would good way go. received 1st Moderna shot 1.5 weeks ago never side effects... even mild pain injection site. wonder phase trials considered be. Typically phase 1 safety assessed, might issue line extensions phase 3 (efficacy). naah we're conspiracy theorists.. IIRC young people robust immune systems. doctor, feel free correct I'm wrong. completely unrelated news today Austrian newspapers reported Kurz government ladt year turned 1.5 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine EU bought thought expensive. much much better things would member states handled themself... anyone else feel like CA one last states open vaccinations general public? supposedly related strength immune system, yes.  believe Illinois already eligibility open people, different groups (though county different rules plus city Chicago). Illinois open lot essential workers (many think would eligible Michigan's current guidelines, example) plus age health condition, health conditions include things lot people like like BMI, asthma, smoking. think something like 8 million people currently eligible (out \~10 million adult population).

Also think May 1st date given Lightfoot Chicago - think state given target dates increased eligibility yet. different eligibility rules state/county/city level, restricting people county specific zip codes others open whole state. giant mess honestly. Regardless, point several countries produced vaccines without profit motive.

I know I'd correlate profit effectiveness, feels like stupid metric follow. I’m eligible that’s feel. 😂

I’m mental health intern provides in-person counseling. state, qualifies healthcare worker. However, position funded education department ID says “education intern” “counseling intern.” Regardless, site able secure doses staff residents categories met state criteria. signed clinic tested positive day first dose scheduled. miss chance prove employment state wait age group open. I’m gonna try going FEMA site hoping since school employees approved there, enough. get vaccine. took 15 days stop spread anyway. We're done. drove 3 hours another state get one last week regrets get 6 weeks (at least) life back. Worth it. know anybody person, I've definitely seen comments online people nasty reaction J&amp;J vaccine. One guy (who recovered covid...this may something bad reaction was) pretty close going hospital, felt bad. got better though. really put end vaccine passport talk then. double counting vaccinated infected people twice get 90%? that's confusing, simply true. insurance even I'm afraid going doctors emergency room

This needs repeated ad nauseum anti-single payer folks get it. 

You pay middleman absurd amount money every month, middleman decide whether go lifelong debt decision doctor made regarding personal health. instead fixing paying premium taxes actual oversight medical pricing, would rather fight death protect right fucked constantly middleman. think (in general) pandemic.. socially acceptable see people public masks,. although also think stigma. (IE = ""Oh, wearing mask?.. must mean sick!"").. even person medical-vulnerabilities trying protect flu-season whatever. 

At least that's I""m hoping (that mask-use acceptable). However given radicalized divisive current social atmosphere is,. I'm holding breath. Nope.  number coronavirus cases Germany grew 20% past week, lockdown restrictions gradually eased, expert Robert Koch Institute infectious diseases (RKI) said figures released country's intensive care doctors warn need ""immediate return"" partial lockdown stave dangerous third wave coronavirus RKI epidemiologist Dirk Brockmann told German broadcaster ARD loosening measures particularly unhelpful given exponential growth occurred British virus variant ""We exactly flank third wave. longer disputed. And, point, eased restrictions speeding exponential growth,"" RKI epidemiologist Dirk Brockmann told German broadcaster ARD. Strawman. Suspending mistake. one issue anyone deciding take look something. That's pretty much saying. Non profit ass.

If difficult AZ profit it, want ?

Oxford wanted open source vaccine. Bill Gates AZ ""convince"" (aka bribe) open source give free AZ ?

Sold cheaper cause money develop came governments, AZ spend money. like Amazon, took blueprint free someone else, mass produce it. even fucked part sold vaccine like airlines sell seats (aka overbooking). Yes free open would take evidence based approach deciding related vaccine. done this. 

They found super rare blood clot issue cases single hospital used basis shutdown rather looking bigger picture. would recommendation test vaccine works children? already shown safe effective adults, need tests children jabbing tens millions kids it. Yes, 100% free recipient. insurance, insurance gets charged. insurance, government pays. Unfortunately weigh enough allowed donate Sure, that’s want believe, go ahead. Switzerland making Moderna vaccine rest world. Yea that's problem reported subsequently spread around social media secondary sources.

Out 1.6 million people vaccinated Germany, 7 blod clots. definitive evidence 7 developed clots vaccine, coincidence because...you know...people get blood clots number reasons.

There likely also blood clots happening Moderna Pfizer shots. guarantee it...humans get blood clots due bad diets, hereditary diseases, plethora things besides vaccine itself.

The problem Europe, vaccine suspended due ""abundance caution"" sends wrong message. People panicking vaccine unsafe...even MILLIONS people shot single case death directly linked it.

If U.S. Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J reasons, absolutely screwed...because public trust would effectively dumpster, matter findings are.

There ton articles pointing precautionary measure, type clots reported common, likely related vaccine. specific type blood clot they're worried (some kind cerebral thrombosis) overall incidence activity levels really cause increase one specific type blood clot.

The Germany data seems show kind link vaccine, although know causative correlation.
Germany usually around 50 cases blood clots per year (in whole population) within matter weeks 7 cases vaccinated population 1.7 million. 

Something's likely going numbers seem justify halting rollout Ten seconds glance profile shows spend far time posting UK do.

Guess inside head one part Empire that's still going strong... pandemic green tier gonna masks distancing California. first shot far worse second shot *not* clearly safe vaccination special form thrombosis occurs orders magnitude often would normally. 

This also *not* mean vaccine *cannot* safe. 

The observed effect caused particular conditions like target group, manufacturing, transportation. factors differ EU UK. [European capitals co-ordinated suspension Oxford/AstraZeneca coordinating bans sounds led science politics. implementations modified spike protein make recognizable multiple forms: I'm going miss much, worry people leave place becomes like subs, less... thoughtful subs. Full antivax conspiracy nonsense, reasonable people left got vaccinated.

The way could French would serve wine. I'm sure would recommendation drink alcohol shortly donation, that's exactly would do. I'm 36 year old teacher, kaiser emailed 3 weeks ago set appointment. So.. Covid probably reached 20% population. Without vaccines would taken another 4 years slowly spread reach entire population.. therefore scale deaths 5X now.. Exactly, absolutely one will. Every vaccine sold healthy profit. started yet. went website register kid said they'd start contacting people enroll start, still process setting facility. That’s conveniently cherry picking teenage behavior. Like fights risky driving behavior. 

Read article title ask it’s sensationalized; “people drive speed limit share traits sociopaths” wouldn’t even trust poison kill political dissident l India vaccinate people already infected recovered?

I asked anti core ratios population almost %40-50 percent parts India. India probably need vaccination half citizens first campaign. Oh sure interesting. I'm ex-German pleasure listening head PEI germany interviewed last night's ""Tagesthemen"" via youtube. laid convincing case caution. clearly outlined cases investigating represent significant statistical outlier. Anyone trying conflate general blood clots willfully ignorant.

Interestingly, asked consequences vaccination campaigns messaging essentially said. messaging concerns separate scientific process. investigate follow investigation numbers take them. First hit free, vaccines shouldn’t be? It’s American government. disaster pandemic. next pandemic comes, pharma manufacturer going want jump bed academic institution watch share price tumble, Governments play stupid PR games? seems like /u/monteml awful troll account. 

Germany 883 deaths/million
Brazil 1309 deaths/million

Bolsonaro worst possible incompetent destroy Brazil. Pfizer 'issues' getting free pass nothing said.

This absolute bullshit. Pfizer issues. Heparin drug hand general population. risk bleeding great. dosed weight half life hours would essentially useless people showing clots days weeks later. I'm sure trolling. implying blood clots, clear rest context post. stated patients Norway blood clots, correct. 

Adverse event reports include symptom blood clots would quite obviously pick cases experienced blood clot conjunction low platelets, whereas checking low platelets blood clots would miss experiencing either symptom. 

I've listened entire EMA conference, EMA director stressed know specifically cases are. german interview suggested there's discussion possibly Hemolytic uremic syndrome, refused pinpointed specifics since know Italy said decission political, decission Norway Austria Germany etc political. countries non-political scientific bodies advised govnerment halt process, whil Italian specialist disagreed advise stop.

So Italian politician take account different governments advised differently scientists matter.

The EMA replacement national EMA set 1995, funding European Union pharmaceutical industry, well indirect subsidy member states, stated intention harmonise (but replace) work existing national medicine regulatory bodies. 

Since agreement diffenet national experts EMA let member states handle decission remove approval would essentially impossible countries wanted continue so, since would national emergency approval case researchers said study - involved 44 vaccinated 22 non-vaccinated long Covid patients - small “to make firm conclusions”, insisted evidence suggest people still suffering symptoms avoid taking jab.

Since recipient's body making antibodies receiving transfusion (unlike vaccine), antibodies received eventually dissipate. much, any, prophylactic effect. treatment used already infected individuals.

[source- can’t assume everyone COVID symptom it. illnesses. standards. can’t imagine false negative rate would statistically significant I've read, 10 million doses AZN 32 cases thrombotic events PFE 24 amount doses. AZN seems bit dangerous stat could also random error. Adverse reactions like 0.0001% cases error comparison massive.  O-H someone lives California, pandemic already want be. Green tier not, many businesses operating 2019. listened Agnes Pannier-Runacher’s itw source mentioned FT European coordination mentions deliveries AZ comes surprise since she’s bloody Minister Industry, Minister Health.
But yeah obviously one big European conspiracy undermine Britain EMA full collaboration MHRA.
Makes sense now.

**Study Descriptions:** purpose study examine conditions COVID- 19 pandemic affect unemployed underemployed workers’ mental health psychological well-being. looking participants 21+ take anonymous online survey ability cope experience decent work COVID-19 pandemic U.S. Eligibility participating study are:

(1) 21 older
(2) Currently residing United States
(3) employed front-line healthcare work (doctor, nurse, EMT)

**Study Link:** (ethical/legal):** responses anonymous. study approved TSU IRB (#HS2020-4548). Information participant confidentiality voluntary participation explicitly stated online informed consent document study.

**End Date:** Open agree post sure getting virus sending 2% children hospital. state looks like 0.7% cases 18 required hospitalization. case rate, reality probably 1/3 rate. I'm Ohioan. insane quickly expansion happened -- watched many Gov. DeWine's COVID-19 press conferences he'd always get questions reporters: ""Why x condition, people 60."" DeWine always said: Old age biggest indicator sickness death. we've gotten many aged done ALREADY, month April, everyone shot getting shot (lol.) 

Unbelievable! great day Buckeye. summer gonna AWESOME. Nooo stopping EU campaign kill people due Covid!!!!!! /s ~~weeks~~ ~~months~~ years

At least EU... talking giving kids vaccine. talking experimenting kids know safe them. Chicken egg know  Wow.

Your opinions definitely shaped facts science anger nationalism all.

The fact is, AZ actually breach contract, EU would actually taken legal action instead impotent angry Eurogammon posturing. saying nothing suspicious 4 cases unqiue pretty much never see pop time, right vaccinating small part population? 


The chances happening random chance insanely low. Always possible got 2019, statistically likely got covid sometime 2020 asymptomatic. look trend lines infections, hospitalizations deaths match excess deaths tracked CDC appears likely little activity February. Yes! ex-German Ohioan ass signing up!

for inevitably need help finding site I've found far help people find ""stock"" like sites, find available appts. section titled **SARS-CoV-2 circulating antibodies time** discusses prevalence decay rate antibodies time. I've maybe 4 months normal life past year, I'm living country relaxed restrictions. could totally believe people locked year. mortality 0-30 agegroup due COVID far? That's impressive, we've least 10. ask basic questions want basic answers. guess hoping things started open april/may colleges would incentive vaccinate students leaving campus maybe not. dad sadly variant kind 4 years ago, took hold life destroyed within span 6 weeks. would never wish disease anybody, difficult thing watch 16 year old watching father wilt away front becoming shell human. One bad guys mean necesseraly good guys. moved Ohio Philly like year half ago, feeling bit screwed lol. I'm wondering I'd able get near parents house Ohio April something. think Philly we're still 65+ date announced it'll lowering. friends family already received able get least month sooner stick Philly gets 16+ May (or God knows when, little faith hit that).  whole point never know FB idiots time. could anti vax lie fits agenda. Unless ask patient information proof. common #1 EU excess death ranking among top 3 death per population EU #5 #6 WORLD death cases every single day... bit urgency Poland learn nose works. ;) 54 too. Covid deaths age 80 like anti-vaxxers want believe. comment linking jacobinmag automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wonder differently slows down. get Maryland, widely dysfunctional gov't. WA? 

Colorado open half population Friday. psyched appt.  Likely drivers license insurance info. WTG! 

13 months emotions pouring really hard contain. 

I want leave work today happy. 

Off work Friday great case reactions. 

Just. So. Relieved. guess I'm less excited several long conversations topic. states different density patterns, populations skew toward different age ranges, politics different (which, days, lot whether people *following* government mandates) differences industries/work life. 

In short, picking two variables (mandates covid cases) likely [spurious Epidemiogy human behavior complicated. 

That said, looking forward actual studies topics. need drink, don’t even drink. Ja. Aber sie brauchen dann 1mo zwischen den Spritzen. Meine Familie ist Mannheim, ich hoffe sie bekommen es bald. know me, full optymism December vaccines hope get one first half year - judging contracts producers. see good, new mutations one two months lockdown let vaccine doctors poorer countries, sounds sane me. also listen podcast talking gave thought. manufacturer says can't deliver cuts production half, let impact half countries. someone produce less still sell normal amount one, small others? just? Lifting mask mandate equal banning masks dude.. states literally believe government authority enforce masks. 

Here podunk Texas people still wear masks public. entire point, government's allowing people choose themselves. vast majority even deep red area choosing cautious. think that's actually rather unlikely, antibodies last 6+ months. capable reading? typical incidence millions per year. AZ used couple weeks now. may found point confusion. look Table 2 following study. IFRs vary widely depending whether low, medium, upper income country. estimates range 0.2% lower end 1% higher far settled matter. Especially presence variants increase overall mortality. wish Virginia would get shit together... nowhere near done Elderly Essential! like Germans 80 years ago...  Thought Austria one wealthier EU countries? wonder amount people specifically schedule shots Thursday Friday ( Saturday Sunday) enough see numbers. know lots people still WFH, everyone know (and works normal m-f, 9-5) tries schedule feel shitty next two days, lounge couch instead trying whatever work do. really shocking. first months pandemic avoided subreddit full people saying pandemic would last years would never go back normal. full people deriding Fauci saying open next week. College professors still eligible. tells vaccine input patient info, select appointment time. walgreens doesn’t appear tell letting schedule second dose (they may tell end) - theoretically, could look appointments it’s 1 appointment.

each county different, guess tell vaccine you’re selecting appointment. would also suggest using [Kansas vaccine finder (scroll down, it’s mid-page), putting county, emailing nearby clinics asking Johnson &amp; Johnson availability explaining preference. checked looks like vaccine finder lists emails clinic makes easier! hopefully help find j&amp;j clinic :) mean, antibody-homekit like 15 bucks? Seems easier going donate get that.  Nothing stopping happening restrictions lifted anyways. experience Austin going pick groceries, take out, pet supplies nothing really changed since mask mandate lifted. businesses required still requiring them. 

Businesses ignoring mandates really changed. bars opened ""restaurants"" open last year. Restaurants opened indoor seating masks really enforce people without masks far could tell. Okay, cool, one-up’d Michigan’s announcement. Let’s see GW ante open everyone Friday, please. still enough change testing capacity weekly basis Proud CSU Viking right here... bad moved West Virginia... isn’t ceiling hit, it’s shot appointments scheduled almost exclusively online tech illiterate generation earth

truth. facebook group, looking vaccine, ones appt issues almost exclusively boomers. mad expanding access b.c can't find appt, dig in. computer, try one site, refuse drive. Every solution offered difficult inconvenient them. vitriol! 

I feel can't find appts appts had. managed secure 6 appts friends, help least, everyone successful first day. fantastic line. I'm going use future. Walmart allows schedule week ahead open new spots midnight. people actually saying that? Like regardless opinion Brexit, UK absolutely benefits handling vaccine rollout. You’re island(s) concentrated population. Looks like us states ready chug beers public together time celebrate guys blowing 3 game none lead 1776 ;) stats seem like Ohio pretty average rust belt. DeWine done stand out? Yeah, mean I’ve seen Reddit isn’t exactly place known rational, mature adults. could done differently avoid that? People refused go get infected. Wyoming myth Hmm. That's odd. know Rite-aid, know sure CVS non-old (well 53) year old friend educator. It’s free. government pays $19 per dose producers. Rest continental Europe soon follow... Hahaha Slightly higher administered last Tuesday, 2 million hoped for. Lowest day week though, here!

The real winner 7.1 million distributed today. Holy shit. Ich hab BMI 30+, werde aber Deutschland bestimmt nicht vor Mai drankommen ... ich überlegs mir. Looking forward New York State following suit Wish charts vaccine distribution Crying Brazilian... Yeah, I’ve said elsewhere last March-May sub time concerning level doom gloom. started frequenting month ago it’s like complete opposite. I’d fascinated know changed. we’ll vaccines kids well..... context, slow pace vaccines low demand issue rather low supply issue. second wave started, we’re expecting pace pick up. guess people assumed covid gone (life mostly gone back normal here) didn’t feel rush get vaccinated. profit vaccine manufacturers always ""influence"" via immense lobbying let's say, convince government ""pause"" competing vaccine, vaccines exhibiting data points/risks. nature for-profit vs. non-profit type market embracing (hate dance around certain words). states US.

Hawaii pretty choice right now: one get without negative test, rates low (40-60 cases day last month, population 1.4 mil), vaccination effort top half states. things opened lot.

Otherwise, things equal, UK probably better every state.  brazil wants super power lmao logic, cisgender lesbians able donate blood

You wouldn’t enough blood donated. Supply needs meet demand. does, selective minimize risk blood contaminated. stands, enough blood still excluding highest risk group (MSM). exactly zero logic increasing people’s risk accepting higher risk blood. simple equation supply demand probability. don’t understand find upsetting. Yup that's I'm referring say could something going happen irrespective vaccine, i.e., vaccine happened administered cause problem. Tens millions people legally allowed work almost entire last year go that’s really significant. random guy europe, Congrats! one getting? I'm trying get mine Friday well really care interested know people getting Ohioans then. think overly fatalistic attitude like counterproductive. money spent. people go doctor pharmacy mass vax site get shot 3 am. Reallocate deliveries away locations can't distribute fast enough. extra money needs used extend hours total locations available. would resolve situation places offer 24/7 open pharmacies doctor's offices? many. hope agree spending 100% money creating locations hours obtain vaccine would cause us reach 50% vaccination 2 weeks early would worth money. Btw also agree point sending every pharmacy country. massachusetts many dead zones parts state know fact local pharmacies. Alexa play “Hang Sloopy”. (fellow Ohioan v pleased). Watching US 180 scope mRNA vaccines appear effective single dose J&amp;J. First doses ~2 weeks ago looking at. Getting close almost 1/3 adults first shot! wish existed COVID especially wish existed others bad. hope anyone needs future gets though I'm much worried folks refuse. I'm worried lazy apathetic go find appt. kind folks know wait around till someone literally delivers vaccine dose silver platter. agree everything said, that's believe best course action acknowledge fact we're inherently self-interested, rather trying swim current hoping people things they're predisposed do.

There ways coerce influence people moderately better behavior short time, beyond people people.

Locking year never going work, matter much works paper. Luckily vaccine now. ""My doctor called yet"" - older folk I've spoken with. I've scheduled tons appointments people, excited vaccine clue proceed. scheduled appointments week people pre-existing conditions (opens Wed NC), thought young eligible. feel like know every detail vaccines distributed (probably similar people thread), amazing loop many people are. sucks ultimately removing barriers proving conditions helps vulnerable. take advantage, someone poor lacks access medical care little computer skills, may hard time proving illness, course people totally without homes stuff. feel frustration though eligible cant find vaccine anywhere less 5 hours away vaccines work expect far likely vaccination mandate mask mandate. shoulder sore first night receiving injection site tender almost 9 days, me. fever, chills, nausea, nothing. thrilled that, reading comments younger, healthier people worse reactions, y'all upset went smoothly. (Only 41 underlying conditions, reference.) norm states since many allow pre-exisiting conditions require proof like said require badges depending categories people get people know negative sides well positives, thank sharing story Actually, true.

Vaccines shipped batch, continuously. means unused doses rise fall shipped batches consumed. no/little unused vaccine doses would limited vaccine appointments.

The two major vaccines use USA require two doses set time period apart, be, design, reserve capacity handle doses. Academic article here: certain point, think makes sense open go. fast everyone can. could whole families get car together - drive stadium done first shot. hope state opens eligibility soon! vaccine rollout slow due lack vaccines.

Although many places slow. less half used problem deeper supply. 43, I'd kicking losing 57lbs year. Luckily still get Friday cause I'm old."
