It recently hypothesized vitamin K could play role COVID-19. aimed test hypotheses low vitamin K status common characteristic patients hospitalized COVID-19 compared population controls low vitamin K status predicts mortality COVID-19 patients. cohort 138 COVID-19 patients 138 population controls, measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), reflects functional vitamin K status peripheral tissue. Forty-three patients died within 90 days admission. patients, levels dp-ucMGP differed significantly survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) considerably higher patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed increasing levels dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) associated higher mortality risk (sex- age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling dp-ucMGP 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24). association attenuated became statistically insignificant adjustment co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling dp-ucMGP 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80). conclusion, found low vitamin K status associated mortality patients COVID-19 sex- age-adjusted analyses, analyses additionally adjusted co-morbidities.

Ding, ding, ding. 

Sharing house breathing air, going pub caught covid. One brought household huffed fumes. = science = bad

It's never simple.

These people see everything terms politics. them, vaccines science; they're politics masquerading science.

There's long history kind thing; science always gets rejected conflicts politics, even people would otherwise trust it. 1930s, German government loved science used German scientific advancement evidence national superiority. science came wrong ethnic group rejected.

Ugh, vacation planned Ft Lauderdale next month making nervous. I'm full vaccinated though Yeah, realised rephrased immediately.

Cheers They've super strict lockdowns though. think they'd want make sure happen again. also island people don’t want get vaccinated around age (30), figure get Covid won’t get sick compare obese elderly person. Telling someone grow *absolutely* insult. vicious one, still.  No, argument there's enough immunity vaccines plain old exposure finally stop using masks lockdowns situations. Vaccine induced protection nature provide high level antibodies lungs nasal passages compared actually caught covid breathing in. means high enough viral load covid could last long enough people cause loss smell/taste symptoms much lower degree. 

Which adds 'We really know maybe super unlucky'. *always* secondary broader issue.

In cases, relates deep mistrust authority. think people charge societies bad criminal (and understandable people would reach conclusion, given mess they've made recent decades), trust kind medicine try convince take. inherently authoritarian nature covid lockdowns makes issue worse: certain section population, fits narrative whereby government takes away freedoms, waits people desperate anything get back normal, offers convenient solution. poke kinds holes logic, motivated reasoning lead people astonishing conclusions.

And another poster pointed out, people become deeply entwined sense identity. cases need kind coherent reasoning behind it: vaccines become associated ""the enemy"" point they're practically thing, vaccination programmes constitute personal attack people love. must gone weird place Mexico I’ve never heard people locking eclipse live there…   Wonder hesitancy Russia distrust Western vaccines disinformation campaign distrust government Sputnik V. precipitous drop COVID deaths happening without masks lockdowns. 

Is another one arguments masks lockdowns useless? way stop preventable deaths. simply impossible. One, sure. All, way. lot people seem think it’s “boomer” older person thing get vaccinated, outspoken anti-vaxxers know millennials Gen Z. people know 50+ got vaccinated. conservative. elderly people 80s 90s (silent generation) remember time vaccines different diseases (like polio) weren’t available actually pro-vaccine younger generations. seen benefits. know one “boomer” didn’t get vaccinated (not counting previously Covid) says would get one needed one travel another country. 1918 flu ravaged world two years became less virulent. Here's hoping similar timeline covid. One hospitals Texas requiring vaccine employment. Another isn't, way masks non patient areas vaccine sticker badge (just like flu). interested see work - probably depending setting, role carrots sticks.  First Covid doesn’t kill mess up. long term effects still discovered. 

Secondly , importantly, would willingly want part infection chain could eventually kill someone, mutate virus something worse? Idk said illegal yeah mean kinda like...what talking lmao effectiveness vaccine? effective! I'm medical professional, doubt please ask doctor - I've looked lot dad's sake. really folks treatments wipe suppress immune system extent can't form immune response produce antibodies worry. 

People organ transplants take medications wipe immune response body reject transplant. die without medication option pausing it. 

People chemo chemo-related drugs like methotrexate good immune response due drug - usually go medication wait they're chemo rounds get vaccine.

In short, cardiac patients good protection anyone. like said, I'm medical professional, worried dad haha. Nobody’s saying it’s acceptable. it’s huge improvement months ago. think biggest reason United States living peak ""Age Misinformation"". Uneducated folks buy everything social media tells them. Willfully pounding rhetoric spewed conspiracy theorists. get wrong certain theories think hold weight. title ""Theories"".

As soon heard whole"" great reset"" microchip idea. 2 thoughts came mind.

#1 already tracked. Ie* cellphones 
#2 elitists truly wanted common folks decreased large numbers would already done long ago. 

I always ask theorists"" Ok, whats end game""?

I've never recieved formidable response. usually ""Theories"" lot RSV area it’s easily confused Covid don’t think religion really root problem. It’s tool. root greed. 

The billionaires multi-millionaires throw power controlling govt don’t pay taxes businesses regulated. 

To buy politicians, control media etc get message govt inefficient, taxes theft, using tax money help poor communism, greatest thing “freedom” means govt tiny way. 

They fund think-tanks come bunch talking points trick people voting interests focusing things like abortion, immigration, religion. Follow money. Giving followup doses mRNA/subunit primer vectored/inactivated vaccine could effective vaccine have. individual health departments make choice; far Canada done (in part successful vaccination campaign last two months). keep rolling vaccinations going need ongoing boosters knows long. must give level, freedom member community. Unless people shouting “my freedom”, want go absolutely alone, need get vaccinated. opinion, that’s worth. Make sure keep masking. I’m fully vaccinated continued wear mask even though likelihood picking bringing home twelves slim, I’d rather safe. Wait til hear many people die day. TX, plenty people still wear masks indoors. governor idiot, glad see individuals still responsible. Delta shown easily escape previous immunity.  matter time mutates makes current vaccines ineffective, combat this?

Not inevitable, actually nearly impossible virus infects. Stop spreading nonsense idea.  part?

Laws change?

Unclear suggestions impossible?

Or openness hearing others’ opinions?

If that’s psychotic, guess I’m stricken psychosis. Haha, dude nobody saying that. point moving goalposts. acting like provided counterpoint actually completely different point altogether. one chose explain difference population me. distilled single explanation me.  good source vaccinated people catching spreading it?

I'm deeply sorry we're talking topic that's black white dead simple one little bumper sticker quip answers everything... check Daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people  sound psychotic. due respect Right, 100% antivaxxers get variant covid gonna die. vast vast majority people don’t get vaccine going perfectly fine. Coming someone fully vaccinated Yep, that's disease works. outside control world permanently different. 

I advise looking many people die cancer every day 300 figure scares you, btw. know, might lot middle ground ""come back unchecked"" ""leave stranded die alone"". right kid. Stay strong!

My kids risky conditions, new variant coming every week, wearing masks I'm anywhere crowded indoors. Delta variant breaks vacccines

Every variant ""breaks through"" vaccines, they're 100% effective. Delta variant significantly better others. breakthrough happens, resulting infection almost always natural ""immunity"" (which dissipates months, even sure, anti-bodies dissipate 3-9 months believe.)

This speculated since beginning, turns antibodies still around virus 4x stronger original

You made get immunity virus also mutates gets stronger

That mutations work. majority mutations actually produce weaker variants. video game virus ""levels get like 85% recently vaxxed/very recently recovered herd immunity. 45% fully vaxxed...is yet, thus....around 10,000 cases per day still.

This take account natural immunities. pandemic dropping despite reaching arbitary 85% vaccination, even cities open experts saying certain surges fall.

Some are, aren't. Many good track records. know tell this, utopia way people die old age realistic. see delta case numbers. Seems like likely hit vaccine hesitant communities pretty hard. Maybe delta turns around fatalities hesitant become less hesitant.  20% bit conservative number. true play words. educated folks understand getting :) Probably they've done well. see urgency. saying ""not really""? 81.9% adults UK received least one shot compared 65.4%  weekly average compared US accounting population? That's terrible. know that.

You're conflating different things. Yes they're saying everyone 18 vaccinated, they're actually saying clearly people 18 hold getting vaccinated. means kids 12 up, getting vaccinated soon can, protected potential problems/issues result COVID-19.

How exactly derive vaccinated moment.
There yet enough evidence use vaccines COVID-19 children make recommendations children"" really pushing hard try increase number vaccine doses going less economically developed countries, messaging way.

So, vaccines brown black skinned countries, less doses children mostly white western would concerned came said dangerous vaccinate people 18, well, that's really unlikely happen.

So fact came said children 18 vaccinated time COVID, information studies done age group bother cause even think wishes good hope family going strong, safe well!

Thanks. genuinely hope family strong, safe well going forward. Thoughts rising death count AZ vaccines given Japanese gov Taiwan?  abott rapid test available pharmacies yourself. pretty accurate symptomatic individuals. Capitalism market business. economic system folks capital control production. 

""With capital"" important, quite hard hold capital yourself. I.e. much land buy defend squatters? Maybe dozen acres? Even then, outnumbered outgunned?

That capitalism requires state defends private property. occasional spats state capitalists, largely superficial. Members state accumulate capital/wealth, capitalists influence state (I.e. buying elections)

It's inevitable unfortunately. ""Pure"" capitalism os imagined either stateless morally pure cannot swayed powerful people. Clerks cannot bought Bezos.

So are, many flavors, counties capital call office courtroom. Nothing pure exist definition. less capitalist aspects society become democratically controlled. Decisions made capital, social need.   Yes it’s already showing problem rural, backward areas. People read sorts rumours WhatsApp vaccine make impotent etc. said, near future, demand much higher supply point USA is, plenty vaccines enough people take them, reached yet  Taiwan bit different, vaccines come mainland China, causes understandable hesitation population.  know, secret conspiracy highest levels human society, sure lot front line everyday healthcare workers physicians scientists secret. basically market manipulation - artificially keeping prices up. Otherwise rent could gone whole bunch landlords race fill vacancies time.

Given potential human cost though, know else could done.  That's wonderful - vaccinated well? One get you. Unless think viruses evolve get less efficient.   exactly? people listen CDC WHO? No-one breaks laws physics country. Especially hit something.  Israel trending last week. might statistical anomaly, might also Delta starting spread. Unfortunately sequencing takes time, hard say sure. Vaccine unavailability contributed extent. also delay extending credit lines manufacturers. follow news articles, daily vaccination numbers quite low phase procurement distribution decentralised.

That change might made due internal disputes centre states policy superior. Free economics almost always triumphs long run. Ineptitude states exactly reason scraping it, maybe is, time tell.

As far yesterday's numbers go, sustainable either. distribution backlog past couple months. Anyone crunches numbers would know rate 45L day current production possible. Alright give us answer oh wise one. said opinion guess vaccines working all.  I…. Agree however much displeases me. appears religion isn’t intrinsic problem quite frankly, morons know many people died putting cancer screening due intangible expensive billing people died Covid.

I know people suffering become crippled due US healthcare system people know bad case Covid two orders magnitude.  best part whole thing is, early Christians like… ultra aggressive Amish. Oh no, rich mom &amp; pops over-leveraged bought house wanted buy could rent me. Fuck em.

Rent business, huge housing shortage. I'm sure there's some, San Diego really place I'd worried multiple churches full unvaccinated people.   happen link? Hit pretty hard. 83 deaths. Lol. discussion Germany moot, yet enough vaccines know sometimes, limits set political reason limited supply (like ""masks help"" mantra early days pandemic).

I strongly suspect leftover doses, takes days, weeks ""approve"" vaccine children.   reported time Norway. Using Pfizer Moderna San Diego county 70% fully vaxxed believe, it’s possible  Go Joe!  That's good. 

We still *really* need step vaccination game, though. vaccines proving solid variants. Anecdotal evidence doesn’t prove anything. Yaaay, congrats family! :D 

Sad friends, though. :( 12?? open game?? 🙄🙄  {sips whiskey} ah man gotta worry brain tissue? get really sad, angry, worried time whenever see comments like that. helps development vaccine-resistant variants.  Honestly, I'm requiring masks implementing whiteboards/textboards/type boards better non-spoken communication addition stepping vaccination.   pushing nations vaccinate kids instead send/donate vaccine COVAX program and/or nations unable procure vaccine themselves.

They saying unsafe vaccines approved 18's instead saying everyone 18 vaccinated, simply saying anything 18.

In US CDC FDA decides vaccines safe eligible get vaccinated, certain vaccines approved 12 up.

Which means kids 12 up, getting vaccinated soon can, protected potential problems/issues result COVID-19.

The really pushing hard try increase number vaccine doses going less economically developed countries, messaging way.

I would concerned came said dangerous vaccinate people 18, well, that's really unlikely happen.

I hope made sense helpful.

Probably also worth noting 7 million delivery basically pulling amount Moderna contracted deliver end June (and otherwise would missed).

However, immunocompromised people really harmed *vaccinated* people returning normal.

Additionally, cases 1/40th peak, Fall peak expected larger 1/5th last year's peak, immunocompromised people still better last year, even makes sense continue certain precautions. didn’t say 100% antivaxxers going get COVID.

Yeah pretty much did. ""See ya, antivaxxers"" means a) anti-vaxxers get COVID b) die.

You amend statement actually mean un-vaccinated people likely contract COVID, exactly groundbreaking information. Even then, statistically, people die. fact OP even really speaking un-vaccinated people general anti-vaxxers specifically, subset larger group people vaccinated. 45,000/365 = 123ish, it’s that… post every one articles? get it, Delta variant become dominant strain. doesn’t change fact vaccinated still strong protraction it.

That's surprise.

Moderna already expected deliver 26.7 million doses Germany Q3, 2 million doses per week. July, commited deliver 733k doses per week, need ramp deliveries significantly August September hit current 26.7 million target Q3.

Now additional purchase 150 million doses, ramp needs really impressive.

Good kid! It’s cost. It’s actual production. variants...do examples thinking about? said would around 300 deaths delta variant.

He said UK much delta variant lower death rate US: words, US death rate UK, would less 300 deaths per day. 

And even understood US different mask mandates vax resistance. go, reasons US might hover around 300 deaths per day long. delta variant indirect cause, US would probably similar numbers (give take 25%) regardless variant. yah... VITT like stroke though ""not dying"" damaging effects. Define hit hard. Vietnam cases crazy high death rate 0    good nature tourism destructive industry. even touched overpopulation question yet. Can't wait day see headline ""US daily covid deaths fall zero first time."" failures current healthcare system provide adequate healthcare neediest citizens (which us point lives).

The poorest U.S. generally covered Trump right, come summer going disappear. failed mention summer, many would dead mean time.   something like 22 states report data, however? doesn’t seem different previous variants regards dangers kids. ripped India surely devastating, thankfully didn’t hear kids ending hospital. Awful analogy. Vehicles use, even save lives allowing much faster rescue sorts life emergency situations. Finally really understand saying? 20 30 mil per day means 900 mil vaccines per month production capacity, even thought India pharmaceutical production giant, number insane even India That’s still lot people dying good news That's lot conservatives pictured. older socialist, makes bit disappointed. shots, nurse told move arm much possible decrease pain. don’t know that’s true immediately shot would still help you, that’s told. long period time Dippy still president USA stop looking news.

But put numbers comment, opinion (and point) **exactly** same. Sure. Go countries abundance vaccine first, supply constraints easily kick decision road.

We day. It’s moot point come fall; formula vaccine change. supply doses increase testing children concluded great success. do, vaccines required go school. Unless need mental health dental.

EDIT: case want argue COVID, UK higher amount deaths per thousand US…   People die flu diseases less severe Covid every year

Except none vaccinated tested exact strain flu died of.

Don't get wrong, zero deaths realistic - **on short term** - even 100% got vaccinated, ""reason"" provided nothing it. there's vaccine that's 100% effective entire population.

However, 100% vaccination would quickly eradicate virus vaccines effective against. get 0 deaths. want go countries?

UK apparently wont give universal recommendation decision vaccinate 12 17-year-old children Covid unlikely recommended UK vaccine experts imminently, BBC one sided issue. understand want vaccinate children. next risk, vaccinating something risks (e.g. myocarditis young people) weighted carefully.

And data available, countries wont give recommendation. Neither WHO.

VILNIUS, June 22 (Reuters) - Lithuanian donate 20,000 doses AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Taiwan, government said Tuesday.

The country May said would open trade representative office year Taiwan, China considers territory, prompting anger Beijing.

The vaccines, donated response Taiwan’s request, transferred end September.
“We’d like more, can,” Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said broadcast government meeting.

The government May decided donate 100,000 vaccine doses Ukraine, 15,000 Georgia 11,000 Moldova.

Taiwan, battling rise coronavirus infections since last month, trying speed vaccination programme hobbled supply delays. 

(Reporting Andrius Sytas Vilnius; Editing Alex Richardson) Yes. work Quality pharma industry. vaccines gone extensive clinical trials, peer review regulatory body review. chance serious adverse event occuring vaccine much lower experiencing serious negative effects contracting Covid, unvaccinated. pandemic fully vaccinated well within fully vaccinated social circles. places high vaccination rates, herd immunity kick in. 

Unvaccinated people vulnerable proportionally many vaccinated surround them. unvaccinated person whose contacts vaccinated virtually immune. pandemic too.

However, unvaccinated people social circles unvaccinated individuals vulnerable strains becoming contagious deadly. them, pandemic continue, unless enough people vaccinate. May ask question American? would feel fully vacinated UK travellers coming vacation US, also negative test flying? general, I’d typically agree, allowing people poised spread potentially deadly virus also never legal normal country. don’t see middle ground, definitely open ideas better solution change opinion matter. You’d surprised. Remember people voted Trump CA TX (or FL). give tax exempt... credit... idk called I'm tax man. could give money towards taxes got vaccine could opposite charge money like health insurance. Interesting!

Also, sets standard/precedent future prioritise spend. rule Ontario mostly well agree dumbest shit ever 54 delta variant becomes dominant US, people try get vaccinated late. reviewed means scientists wrote study. goes peer review vet studied wrong. practice, long scientists well know respected (in case), conclusions likely stay.

No, anecdote great. Since shared anecdotes, data. 

Breakthrough cases least common enough Tennessee department health publicly tracking them. [See - critical indicator report, page 5. June 10th state Tennessee (not state btw, mom lives, discussing it) 940 breakthrough cases. 

See June 3rd St Louis. say breakthrough cases ""extremely rare."" goes department identified 212 breakthrough 350,000 adults St. Louis County fully vaccinated, according state vaccine effectiveness 90% higher, small percentage people still get evidence shows vaccination may make illness less severe breakthrough people may hospitalized die breakthrough infections present minor symptoms. 17% health department's cases, person asymptomatic tested exposure, usually household member COVID-19 unvaccinated.

The vaccines less effective Delta variant. Delta variant prevalent community, cases growing region, people getting sick vaccinated, seen handful fully vaxxed people test positive. Given data listed above, I'd say clinic's experience pretty typical.

I feel appropriate respond person's query telling breakthrough cases rare, rare mean thing medicine colloquial terminology. Certainly depends magnitude damage we’re talking here. Remember bottle beer also causes brain damage. Also brains organs repair themselves. That's sad. hope never happens, going die, may well public spectacularly raise awareness... That's giant reservoir virus mutate something vaccine resistant. great. That's best part. conspiracy magnitude would require bribing *disappearing* literally hundreds thousands people, complete cooperation hundreds governments political motivations far apart usually can't even agree sky blue.

One vaccine producing lower antibodies isn’t bad long amount well threshold. problem scientists don’t know interpret antibody number. Also immune system antibodies. 

For example, PHE found AZ 92% effective versus delta variant Pfizer 88% effective. doesn’t mean Pfizer worse AZ. equally good highly effective. heard stories people dying thirties delta variant. Sure it’s high even people 40s 50s succumbing. scary fk. low risk blood clot definitely scary chances dying covid blood clot. rough maths AZ given entire population India, total number blood clot cases would equally 1.5 times peak daily death rate. daily death rate India undercounted well. put things perspective.

In terms length, already year data first vaccinated. really plausibility side effects popping year. vaccine ingredients broken within hours days,and immune response peaks weeks slowly wanes. side effects associated vaccines pop year. Guess we're finally gonna get efficacy data Moderna J&amp;J. I'm rural area 50% vaccinated county yet almost one masking social distancing anymore.

The unvaxxed rude delta awakening soon. We’re looking different scales. rates increasing time doesn’t mean many individuals aren’t taking advice losing weight. don’t give things let worst outcome happen overall numbers getting worse. We’re eventually going die, health typically get worse every year, it’s still worth exercise, go doctor, eat right meantime. You’re letting perfect enemy good. Every time take mom doctor appointment, make sure mask. They're course required *every* doctor office. 

She's gives ""Why? thought over!"" speech. think over? *never* sees anyone wearing masks lives.

I think watches TV reads papers, rarely gets leave nursing home. 

So basically every time makes outside, every weeks, seems surprised ""still going on"". 


On flip side, someone knows well we're still middle pandemic, daughter getting tired masks. beginning, *wanted* wear one, parents grown-ups wearing them!

Now mask fatigue, extra hot past weeks, hardly sees adults mask on. Masks lost excitement. Every chance gets, keeps taking off. 

So, despite young vaccine, still danger still wear mask. 

I still wear mine sometimes out, time work. still ""required"" job, fewer fewer people wearing. Vaccination also required work (and they've providing shot us since *January*), think we're pretty comfortable other. I'm glad I'm NZ totally support keeping borders closed long needed kept us living restrictions like rest world worry virus. want see rest world hurry vaccinations get variants. day I'd like see family US again. thread might best place rant plan go goes. 

Its great see vaccines effective new variant, else tired seeing news variant along literally every one ""more infectious"". sounds like infectious original virus. Infecting people vaccinated. Spreading getting people vaccinated sick.  IDK, think im tired hearing every variant dangerous real danger people HAVENT vaccinated like original covid-19 outbreak.

End rant.  happy anyone vaccinated still continuing safe That’s really admirable. Amazing different cultures work. America decision would backfire lead suspicion. losing sense smell, search 'covid phantom smell' Florida. governor fanatical trump minion dumb enough one school ban vaccinated teachers around kids. ones legitimately able get vaccine vehemently chose get vaccinated got sick went back living life normally, sympathy for.

Imagine dying Covid June 2021 country vaccines available months. Embarrassing. know else post problem goes: 
 
In country get tested free rapid antigen tests pharmacies test stations. also get 5 tests per week test home. 
 
 
 
I'm competitive athlete recent lockdowns allowed continue training competing contact sport. result team extensive testing protocol involved getting tested official capacity (pharmacy, drive testing stations, etc.) training days, days games days games. resulted 5-6 weekly tests. 
 
6 weeks ago tested positive pharmacy. took necessary steps, called government hotline, club got pcr test done right away. day got positive ag result tested 3 times, positive. Tested GF batch twice, negative. 
 
Next day PCR test comes back negative. Tested right away, positive again, tested gf, negative again. 
 
Since episode i've gotten weekly pcr tests they've never positive, antigen tests off, sometimes varying results nose throat swabs. Tested gf brother tests consistently negative. far happened RealyTech Lungene manufactured tests, ones I've gotten free. 
 
I've talked doctors, pharmacists one clue could be. sure hell covid. 
I'm pissed point find anyone knows anything similar experience. 
 
Just got first Pfizer jab bother long, still extremely frustrating. 
 
tl;dr: antigen tests mostly say covid 6 weeks (until now), pcr tests come back negative. why? But... somthing like 90% infected people vaccinated get hospitalized either?  Florida, stay classy. Well ain't medical oddity. 

Luckily facts people like vaccinated person story totally different. lived Ozarks couple years surprise me. see going everyone going lives like pandemic going on. Balloon festivals community events going lots people attendance. 30% vaccination rate people carrying like covid big deal. people care, like people care far outweighs people do. horrible going get worse.  Yes, illegal cover face many states. laws passed combat KKK

They usually say ""with intent conceal identity"" trust law fair this? people advocating vaccines trying help people avoid illness even death. yesterday Florida reported, 2 unvaccinated people died several got ill Manatee County Office, one vaccinated person fine. pointless death illness, along spreading virus others.

The people hospitalized covid aren’t vaccinated.

 sure that’s hard understand. Florida government

That's key phrase story. probably dumb question mean Covid end evolving existence, eventually become weak nobody notice it? Australian living UK here. definitely side effect good covid control. People far focussed side effects Australia UK benefits much clearer, immediate terms travel such.

You mentioned strict lockdowns, mostly affected Victoria, lower vaccine hesistency states. Lockdowns states breif and/or mild compared Europe 80+% protected, even delta variant running rampant there. Define ""fucked."" think progress vaccines made undone then? Alternatively though, little COVID Australia, virtually one immunity. United States, significant percent (maybe 1/3 more) population survived COVID therefore immunity. Australia needs vaccinate higher proportion population get herd immunity effects US Europe. Japan issues China vaccines, prudent go Pfizer Moderna. really thing it. Washing car actually rests back clean. People US long save gave obesity front. even sure debatable given statistics. they’d like maintain covid 0 get fussed. Gee free vaccine person US could get anytime protect covid.

However people running con also friends I'm going asshole it. actually said absolutely comply required, personally feel requirement ridiculous.

There's still month go; may change minds, I'm counting it. philosophy whole thing let person decide themselves, respect everyone's personal choice. Yeah, convincing lie. That's whole problem. Russians easily sway US public opinion spreading plausible misinformation  worry Delta variant find you, wherever probably started? Women 71% likely anti-vaxxers “The highly contagious delta variant fastest fittest coronavirus strain ""pick off"" vulnerable people, World Health Organization said.” TL;DR higher vaccination rate measures lower spread, make mutations less likely get control.

I'm expert, understand it, viruses get eradicated high vaccination rates. rate needed depends infective virus effective vaccines are.

When virus get eradicated, inevitably mutates time existing vaccines may protect us extent. Even do, risk unvaccinated people may higher virus infective (it spread better certain percentage vaccinated people) severe consequences.

The base reproduction number indicates many people infected reach infected person average nobody protected.
The effective reproduction number influenced protection given measures like distancing, better hygiene masks one side immunity (whether infection vaccination).

If virus base reproduction number 6 example, infect large percentage population quickly.
If 80% people vaccinated vaccine that's 100% effective nobody yet immunity, resulting reproduction number 6 * 0.2 = 1.2. numbers 1, number cases grows exponentially. hypothetical numbers, vaccination rate combined effectiveness vaccine enough. need 5/6 population immunity. Alternatively, measures like distancing masks make harder virus infect people. measures make 40% harder virus spread, would change resulting number 1.2 * 0.6 = 0.72. means gradually disappear.

Now certain variant twice infectious, measures enough (1.44 1). strain 90% immunity would still control. strain vaccines protect well, also result higher resulting number.

That vaccination rates important, combined preventative measures. Measles example high reproduction number (12 - 18), high immunity rates (95%+) needed keep control. long resulting reproduction number low enough mutations can't thrive pose significant risk. mortality flat majority older population vaccinated spread driven young yet vaccinated vaccine works. Like, really *really* works. live life  think many countries politicians waited turn like every citizen get vaccinated, weird Americans politicians vaccinated quite early (if wanted). “""Almost cases unvaccinated people that, opinion, put harm's way pandemic."" don’t get uptake Pfizer/moderna slow.

First think remember emergency use early start vaccine rollout. started later say USA.

The main issue however supply. government bet heavily AZ, mRNA get going out. Demand well ahead supply.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* None sources quote figure, let alone 99.75%. say 'overwhelmingly', 'almost all'. get wrong, wish figure true, least 90% 99% something. giving specific number like bad data really responsible. Actually way does. checked formula says ""risk"". question becomes risk what? answer apply formula three risks - cases, hospitalizations, deaths.

I degree math confirm mathematical formula makes sense applied three, long use formula every ""risk"" consistently type risk analyzing (so example can't replace risk unvaccinated groups hospitalizations replacing risk vaccinated groups deaths). sure point making. It’s 140% infectious original strain, ravaged India May. However, it’s 140% infectious age groups, young people. Effective rate reproduction higher younger people simply fewer vaccinated fear literally virus, there’s need unnecessarily paranoid make sweeping decisions Makes sense since virus needs hosts infect.

Unvaccinated younger people hence affected. CNN article effects alpha strain young people.
 That’s terrifying  Probably, also possible Moderna could slightly effective. Moderna actually gives higher dose vaccine Pfizer. Data show side effects, indication immune response.. I've also seen data Moderna slightly better antibody responses poster notes, data showing higher efficacy 3 weeks post first dose. Given this, minimum seems unlikely worse Pfizer. don’t see make liar. look beyond Sunday. Also wait today’s numbers. see huge drop. example, 1.6 million vaccinated M.P yesterday 5600 today. hardly vaccination last week. Also UK late order Moderna, result we've trickle since April. 


AFAIK around (560k doses couple weeks ago, likely 700k now) Moderna administered UK compared 75 million doses delivered overall. 


Really rounding error. Well, 1 dose effective it. many people 1 dose may still impacted (some countries gone 1 dose strategy) - global discussion. world Covid economic social disruption many months still... People also get fatigued trying help people won’t help themselves. dehumanizing relate feeling.

Is new anti-vaxx argument? People fed idiocy dehumanizing right get sick, die infect others? can't wait find Sinovac it. paid shit well... bothers people adversaly affected pandemic getting relief. Better use tax dollars say arming police giving tax cuts bracket. may hold true developed world, explain delta variant ravaged India country largely unphased previous iterations disease. Undoubtedly always severely undercounted number cases country, undeniable delta variant caused much bigger problem there. 

It's 40% contagious...its fitness spread exactly makes younger people susceptible. indicates infects people easily, either spike protein evolved better infecting us something changed helped evade inate immune responses. possess inherent properties make dangerous younger people. plenty reasons expected production dip new facility comes online.  Good hear this. worried. Canadian. Fully agree chance fully open early. 

Things already pretty normal Ontario, pretend things fine aren't. r/angryupvote lie abundance data

Although true fewer vaccinations day before, Sunday

Also 5.3 million doses administered today, second highest number till date, 53,000 vaccination centers compared ~68,000 monday. Title could better pretty clear, Covid news bad. 

Perhaps something along lines ""Why majority Covid-19 news US bad news?"" [Appears sadly didn’t find number hospitalization. US education problem, public private level. means 40% – nearly half – indeed vaccinated. I’ve seen numbers you. kid get sick say. /s still application vetting process check afford rent, think. That's works state. 390,000 rental units San Francisco, average rent 2,900. would billion dollars pay rents one city year 2020. think money exists pay rents year whole state.

But yes, annoying scraped together money pay rent last year, free rent program works. good eyes??  don’t even lockdown UK. article concerns Delta Variant spread  president US get press articles vaccine research. Muttimmunization. mRNA vaccines going change face medicine. can't wait see results cancer vaccine trials Biontech started! Well feck. Commenting save info later Yeah go see vaccination numbers past days. constant decline. past 2-3 days, hardly vaccinations done many states. hitting numbers lot earlier. takes full day fucking govt start PR  done it! aint got angry use word ""cure"" ""all"" talking future infections. actually said was, ""It prevents almost future infections.""

It reduces likelihood 95%, enough people get vaccinated, R0 would high enough virus continue circulate population. Sounds like TVA job. Gotta prune variant. Yep, many countries early days. Germany exception. 

UK surge testing delta judging current low death/case ratio, case counting far accurate compared western countries. Yes, correct.

But properly analyze data (and willing believe authors paper correctly) something effect of:

1. Divide everyone groups (vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated). groups different sizes.

2. Divide groups subgroups based age pre-existing conditions.

3. Then, subgroup, compute (#of deaths)/(# people group). 

4. compare vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated subgroups. 96% efficacy, find value 96% smaller vaccinated group unvaccinated.

The reason number deaths comparable groups vaccinated group much larger unvaccinated group, demographics make vast majority deaths. see UK extremely high vaccination rate among elderly.

Thanks sharing that. first people received trial vaccines year ago, evidence shows still robust response. think we'll need boosters, people received vaccine spring still good protection fall winter even can't/won't receive boosters.

There's evidence vaccine effective immunocompromised people. people still risk Trump Biden also elderly pre-existing conditions insane, inventory mRNA vaccine technology says spike protein dangerous? consider seasonality note flu deaths reach level noise summer months. SARS-CoV-2 seasonality less well defined, clear major seasonal effects play virus. chance Northern Hemisphere major surges time last year weather cooled despite major variants concern higher rates spread becoming predominant late winter. 

I sure getting 81,000 deaths estimate 2017-2018 season. CDC's best estimate 61,000 wide confidence interval (but want take high end confidence interval, add 30% COVID deaths match excess death metrics well). That's 167 deaths/day worst flu year decade. average past 10 years 36K year, 100 deaths day mentioned above. 

I unsure masking social distancing came play comments. stating COVID still killing people flu. factually accurate statement nothing interventions. number one intervention right vaccination - continuing involuntary masking, social distancing, restrictions. Unfortunately political mandate vaccinations - either overall within populations (e.g., government employees, schools, transportation, etc) - there. people continue die. 

I optimistic deaths go 100/day (to best threshold get ""under flu"" levels) short term without tackling vaccination rural low-vaccination regions. kind unfortunate requires 3 shots though. states gonna hit hardest Delta variant states won’t lockdown bring back restrictions circumstances, low vaccination rates.

(On hand, fully vaccinated since April nice too.) open pretty much whole time. Yep, ok, tried. completely incapable admitting made mistake. havent admitted specifically highlighted 2 doses 14+ days. denying basic math. interested real conversation. 

Blocking moving on. Goodbye, hope yoy become better.  really, considering he's old enough probably early vaccination anyway. think ""alternative"" people want get vaccinated actually it, them, cant protected level dont spend rest lives saying cant expect people do. Hmm actually looks like wrong. strong legal precedent gives states right vaccination mandates. still enforceable today's US political climate, might survive modern legal challenge since 100 years old, books.

The best long-term hope might fore vaccination technology get good people get vaccinated get completely permanently removed potential infection pool people want get it, well bear consequences alone. Still sucks autoimmune disorder normal flu season. managed get back last October, took six months. lucked got right things got really bad there. I’m sorry hear you’ve lost people too. want everyone safe see families safely. 
I think lot aussies don’t take seriously haven’t seen bad get. 99.3% covid cases Indiana unvaccinated people. Hasn’t Georgia open while? 20% states reached 50% **one** shot. 

There many states right things fine. Whatever way put it, surely motivate people get vaccination! Asthma wasn’t shown risk factor severe covid. statistic value well. directly tells rate vaccine hesitancy without needing additional conversion. Moderna OG, company even named mRNA. major contribution suppose there's still question different results different studies whether truly effect think we're seeing real world answer that. Non-modified RNA immunogenic. Moderna doses lot bigger (100ml vs 50ml Pfizer believe). Shame test smaller dose like Pfizer, would've doubled supply equally effective lower dose. Taiwan China's territory. China governing Taiwan. government.

China claims Taiwan. Taiwan also claims China (or least used to, know current status). No, vaccinated, virus replicate inside shedding it. 10 states reached 50% yet, wonder there's something states common. know fact I'd guess major demographic lagging vaccines right (18-26) also demographic visits primary provider least, :/   Unless actually wearing N-95 pretty meaningless. Regular masks protect others (in case sick) . help wearer may 10%. Georgia tell citizen, fine vaccine wise lol it’s science works, offered bet whether Moderna numbers within 5 percentage points Pfizer data, I’d make lot money betting are.

This *exactly* science works. 

If bet right, get grant next time round. world neither things. try Eastern Europe.  Woo Hoo Indiana top 40! Suck Georgia state live in? pretty sure fine.  Yeah masking really hard. worst, vaccine complication rate 1 per 10'000, lot means got really poor QA. COVID complication rate 10-30%, chance contract pandemic ends is, according official Moscow statistics, assuming we're middle pandemic, \~10% (you may multiply number factor 2-3). vaccine complication rate lower 1% efficiency greater 0% safer vaccine all. Took long enough understand this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 60% doesn’t sounds good… obviously talking majority. I'm completely fine taking time lift restrictions. one better? Saying many take have. statistic taken way meant valuable. see whole populatio,n age group, take.it , etc.  17-24, listed dependent got check. parents got extra 300 child check. Either way parents got money didn’t give you. Sure can't get shot, use would including statistic be? difference 95.2 94.1 isn’t actually difference statistically speaking.

To clear, difference statistically significant depending variance measure (i.e., numbers close mean statistically different). However, recall correctly, case correct. And, even statistically different, magnitude small practice think would become issue.  Kind point, no? Great news ! Serious question: need get vaccinated I’ve already COVID. Read article antibodies stay lifetime.. getting different answers Similar technology play, would make bet.  there's 12 million people CA TX. problem easy get age group ponder mortality.

I agree know anything done that. Shaming understanding going potentially kill parents probably easier. think us, even ""good kids"", done really really stupid stuff young. unnatural age grasp gravity situations.  AZ + Moderna tomorrow    agree principle, youngest baby boomers late 50s  vaccine perfect, always minority sadly react badly. 20 million adolescents young adults, 300 resulted cases heart inflammation.

The vast majority safe. That’s numbers work game changed. always vaccinations     that? USA whole unwilling what’s right. lot things could’ve done pre-vaccine mitigate this. things still options.

Literally 48 minutes ago lmao Wouldn’t Sunday Sunday 8 day average? mathing out, approximately 1 every 75,000 vaccinated young people. 80% cases mild and, far, person country died life-changing life-shortening outcomes.

Does really seem like effective argument tactic you? US basically impossible Chinese style lockdown police refuse enforce anything covid related, attempt restrictions things like travel private gatherings point low voluntary compliance. That’s scientists decide.

The CDC decide, made statements favor opening up. over. There's also lesser greater vaccines, that's anti-vax disinformation.   deaths occuring 

Nursing homes

Hospitals 

What age range I'm taking issue idea using last winter predict winter. completely ignores vaccines natural immunities present majority. context lockdown wear makss peak flu season China? Australia 2 fatal cases 2 million first AZ shots. Mind blowing someone think government goddamn inept can't healthcare (a thing every first world country figured generally enjoys) also ability massive conspiracy inventing disease creating shot thats get microchips people.  actually know ingredients vaccines patents.

Absolute rubbish. exact ingredients listed fact sheet given getting vaccine (Pfizer), holds Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine includes following ingredients: mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 \[(polyethylene glycol)-2000\]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, sucrose.

I copied literally **the first result** ""pfizer vaccine ingredients"". Yep, even specify ""covid"", Google knows.

I never understand keep repeating crap takes literally 5 second search find list. actual Sunday toll 90 insane see even considering Sunday. again. Aside lazy counter-argument, you’re barking wrong tree haven’t owned car years never felt safer.

≈99.999% time, cars cause death due human error. Maybe area. area fine pretty much middle that's right - zero Covid countries.

Australia NZ much community spread begin with. countries spread got hand never zero COVID. always endemic. Well passengers plane required quarantine. unsure flight attendants that's definitely potential risk. 

All arrivals required take taxi quarantine hotel. definitely sounds like weak link me. far outbreak emerged aspect. 

I assume there's plastic screen driver passenger. know certain airport taxi drivers allowed take people airport quarantine hotels allowed collect passengers. 

They also keep record passengers matched driver. passenger found COVID, driver his/her family sent quarantine hotel too. I'm Russian. hesitant vaccine, too.

Normally, I'm antivaxxer. government promoting ineffective medicine (see Arbidol, Grippferon, Kagocel) since start pandemic, rolls something calls ""the world's first COVID vaccine"". pocket medical experts say Navalny simply metabolic disorder, people start praising Sputnik V. September comes, someone finds discrepancies Phase I/II testing protocols. Phase III protocols come, whole result refers data provided Ministry Health. whole story smells like shit mile away.

So saw San Marino's incidence rate drop like stone, reasonably confident Sputnik V yet another bullshit ""miracle cure"", hoped they'd let us get Western vaccines huge overprice. Guess I've wrong both.

""What cost lies?"" sure heteronormativity affects life expectancy

For starters, affects data categorized biased. People penises lumped certain category due heteronormative convention, among things.  know virus spreads robustly winter much point discussing further...that research need do... Australia deaths 2021…

Like There's reason say ""new normal"", that's essentially describe last sentence. there's enough vaccine uptake country, might see end year. ""objective"" ignorance internal bias. even realize heteronormative conventions implicit opinion. ""Men"" often shorthand persons penis, absolutely assume particular gender. ""gender science"" studies sex differences completely false product heteronormative patriarchy.

Haha, people downvoting us conversation other.   Bang know guy whose wife divorcing got it. Guess get memo wives America. That’s scientists decide. We’ve spent cumulative six-months hellish hard lockdown don’t wish upon anyone, I’m fan ending everyone, following guidance.

Additionally, EU using almost entirely mRNA vaccines. half UK's vaccines AZ, might substantially weaker sterilizing immunity.

The situation America rather different, much country well beyond vaccination point needed end pandemic. absolutely highly populous places there.  US Europe though, summer bringing lower reproductive rates overall, holes vaccination population protection might see fall. many Reddit don’t want COVID go away. dont count anti vaxxers everywhere.

60+: Seniors government wants pfizer approved under-15s got enough moderna doses end pandemic early July - get arms. since people already gotten first dose, means shoving moderna second dose.

As safety, there's reason going expect safety issues, safety issues found anyone who's given mixed doses. We'd actually expect previous vaccines mixing doses give better result, particular give smaller dose first bigger dose second ideal. However, also would expect (and evidence for) waiting longer doses gives better result, waiting get pfizer whatever.

Soon I'll travel Germany studies get vaccinated yet. However, home country offers Pfizer vaccines age group right now. think wise take first dose later try get second dose Germany? far I'm informed unlikely get vaccinated soon city I'm going demand high. probably get vaccine late summer. downside see first dose getting recognized either go without official certificate (which would defeat secondary purposes getting vaccinated me) get third dose. questions are: one get vaccinated asap even gonna first dose time (like 2 months most, probably) harmful get third dose close second? I'm inclined towards getting want least protection traveling. Wait multivalent mRNA boosters really feel need additional protection.

It’s 1700s , taxes aren’t going towards making King rich anymore . 

People need ok taxes .

Even money goes towards helping house lazy person. street they’re gonna commit crimes . 

That turn puts strain tax paid facilities , street sweeping policing healthcare . 

Sometimes spending money one thing actually saves others .

And sometimes money spent view freeloaders actually makes life safer, happier healthier .

I want everyone housed country think would make cities cleaner . 

Canada sort similar US terms social welfare , keeping people steeet don’t realize bunch homeless people around actually makes society worse .

We need suck straight house everyone . Nobody homeless doesn’t want to.

I absolutely hate seeing homeless people makes day worse . I’d rather tripping balls home.  im masking, unvaccinated kid home sure hell would be.  highly doubt trump would reinstated covid task force keeping consistent regular messaging press/public, working mobilize federal govt get done ASAP, didn’t mobilize govt hardly left office. also doubt would put money, thought, effort try make vaccine access equitable.

Well, Myanmar deep shit moment one giving up. military guns gonna give up. people Myanmar still talk tough. virus definitely give up. Like.....Florida. Yup. mystical fairy land live that's zero death 2021? mean 0 covid deaths, 0 preventable human death, 0 death general? post covid, first sentence preventable human death, sign says ""deaths"" without specifying, little confusing. feel like worried, hasn’t consistently said something, walked back statement, completely reversed previous statements like entirety COVID? read? mask mandates allowing indoor dining masks. two separate studies two separate sets data.


""During study period, states allowed restaurants reopen on-premises dining 3,076 (97.9%) ""

Why would studying masks restaurants even open?






""Mandating masks associated decrease daily COVID-19 case death growth rates within 20 days implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining associated increase daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41–100 days implementation increase daily death growth rates 61–100 days implementation.""

Contrary popular belief vaccines fucking Star Trek shields. Two weeks second shot body go ""shields red alert"" dramatically/magically keeps infected. still infected virus. question humanity going stop making stupid mistakes allow variant strains continue emerge before, released tested released, becomes utterly useless. Putting us right back square one. That's optimistic too. reason hear variants they've mutated enough possibly serious concern. still somewhat slow find start trying take region(s). still large quantities world extremely dense populations areas fully vaccinated. variants thrive areas. already saw variant emerge started 
 resistance antibodies survivors less year. variants (from original strain) running around. think, current actions &amp; choices, could easily (or worse) again. There's something wrong you.

The vaccine turn us immune demigods. research stop relying others information may partly completely wrong.

Sure, locked everyone inside houses months might able eventually stamp Covid, doesn’t mean it’s worth cost (nevermind unintended consequences that). says? don’t say who? mean guess. pure capitalism lack government intervention. think probably agree there’s significant failure private capital deliver positive health outcomes certain subset population (ie, poorish people)…All honest discussion healthcare admit isn’t really desirable even possible purely capitalist healthcare system. none requirements/hallmarks free market you’re sick. they’ve already it.

Maybe reach primary get test yourself. Link? Source needed. fat greatest US tragedy, yet primary talking point consistently economy. mutations work. majority mutations actually produce weaker variants. video game virus ""levels up

It's actually funny misconception people realize. point virus kill humans, survive. likely best way survive remain undetected means less symptoms. Games like plague inc fun realistic all. Agreeing way. Overwhelming majority unvaccinated could useful travel related testing. Canada requires Canadians get PCR test coming back country difficult find PCR rapid tests many states Georgia (Atlanta area) Alabama (Birmingham area) weekend flight back Canada. anyone know Health Canada approves Lucira self test allowed back country? That’s said.  $10k day publish stories Good question. would like know well.  ""The science settled"" . laugh whenever hear parrot say that.  Vaccines effective problem it’s ridiculously infectious probably slightly deadly compared original strain rips unvaccinated populations Seven day moving average, today, 928. beginning month 1,000.  kind like flu shot still get infected (and pop test) symptoms (albeit brief mild) kill put hospital. virus going away need treat make less severe. It’s probably bigger factor think. They’ve decades. 80’s planted story CIA created AIDS, false story still believed people day. Oh worries. reduced ignorance another area, that's awesome &amp; appreciated! even 20% fully vaccinated 75% going take us least end year rate. Trudeau keeps promising ""more orders deliveries"" that's going year still stuck mud. goal posts move one. Forcing needles people's body never legal normal country. let pharma bribe doctors pump opiates ten years, might well bribe pump vaccines ten weeks. far available 50s state. lot fear mongering media, people get avoiding it.

I think big issue Australia much lower rates covid rest world. means lot people feel like rush vaccinated wait pfizer.

Unfortunately, last week outbreak delta variant started airport worker 50 completely unvaccinated, risk higher people think. still priority groups people can’t jump queue paying it. private hospitals still follow schedules set government.

But brief time age group city, availability jabs private hospitals better procurement independent government. It’s similar states/cities availability state/city/village common issue countries well. Give fellow Missourians time, get numbers back /S still quarantining going essentials? I'm sorry, catch size USA means national numbers aren’t important. Jacobolus pointed above, anti-vax vax resistant folks concentrated areas others. June 14th, Vermont reached goal getting least first shot 80% State population. contrast, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama Wyoming less 50% population first shot. Within States also variation County. Numerous Mississippi counties &lt;30% residents vaccinated.

Those counties vulnerable outbreaks, particularly Delta strain. understand similar countries- example UK endorse mix match situation limited supply late December last year, (promoting alarmist piece Nytimes)

The ""limited supply"" caveat apply everyone got Pfizer - since got 7 million Moderna doses delivered week Canada first dose, many need given away Pfizer AZ first doses (or go COVAX). believe provincial health basically Canada one currently allowing heterologous ""mix-match"" overall approach good logical. 

Makes sense. feel like trials probably key establishing efficacy mix-and-match, data directly health departments important safety concerns need answered.  time last year would refresh site multiple times day Aren’t fully vaccinated people still dying variant? definitely tell laws definitely test. knows else may possibly exposed? said boosters ready 100 days. able boost variants anyways.

My issue time would take distribute re-vaccinate world population came that. Pfizer current vaccine ready distribution December 2020 NZ getting doses general public August age group scheduled October earliest. 

If needed whole new jab could mean another year pandemic isolation borders closed. Yes, people probably bring kids stores take kids restaurants. kids also continue wear masks.

All things, view, relatively minor.

The main point making that, US least, become largely individual risk assessment, many people assessment rightly return ""normal."" “Of these, 527 unvaccinated 84 806 received doses - although unclear long since second dose, takes couple weeks build protection.”

It unclear long since second dose. Big data point missing here. got second dose &lt; 14 days really
“Fully vaccinated” point supply lungs run Flu deaths accepted completely normal rare. COVID deaths lower that, says past time panic instead time relax bit. help? Australia 1000 deaths. Nice try. There’s still MIS-C concerned about, least. aggressive variants developing time. kids okay doesn’t mean kids. I’d rather take extra precautions know I’ve done everything possible keep children safe. Cases 10% past 14 days, vaccination rates solid CA, see kind increase, don’t think see exponential growth, flatten pretty quickly. virus running places go. doubling every 20/25 days started? Yes, supporting *people* depend tourism? wish true autonomous region US could tell people buzz care much stuff. either. people obsessed idea selfish desires override everyone else's well safety (what think ""freedom"" means), many seem intentionally seek odds larger community hell score points similar minded jerks. 

They really concept means live civilization. people please *stop* insisting death *only* negative outcome COVID? 

Long COVID COVID-caused disabilities going hit economies societies pretty hard current ways... mania guess Help rich country help citizens? dunno That's year old. Hospitals started reporting directly CDC long ago. Yeah, I'm fully vaxxed I'm still wearing mask, I'm taking *any* chances Delta crud. Hope survive without permanent disability getting anyone else sick.   Apparently Guangdong probably highest vaccine uptake due ongoing outbreak. 60 million shots Guangdong alone last 30 days, going 40 million jabs given 100 million mark yesterday. It’s NetJets subscription! I’m upper middle class!  Really bad things, I'm worried. 

This absolutely *refuse* properly wear mask everywhere *least* summer 2022. doesn’t recommend vaccine 18, somewhat understandable 
       
Young adults age 18 39 clearly age 18 over, webpage link clearly states eighth paragraph COVID-19 vaccines safe people age 18 years older: 
       
""The COVID-19 vaccines safe people 18 years older, including pre-existing conditions kind, including auto-immune disorders. conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver kidney disease, well chronic infections stable controlled."" I'm like you! Well, already fatigue, concentration, digestive issues pre-2020, want reason someone *else* ends disabled months even life. magnitude easier isolate virus live island nation central global economy. vaccines working reduced cases exaggerated lot less people getting tested?  literally though. PPP specifically helps businesses either dropped employees payroll (or pay them). run business, ""employ"" myself, get PPP either. 
 
To get W-2 company, I'd reclassify C-corp S-corp, total headache, mention start actual payroll myself. I'm 11 month baby. risk want first sickness Covid never gotten chance build immunity anything. 

I trust folks around me. bring Covid home? I'm happy read this, hope horror India soon over. 
A question you, US many people refuse vaccinated likely reach herd immunity. think many people India refuse vaccination? wish vaccines refused US could shipped India. reason people take flu shot every year: think risks come possibly getting vaccine side effects outweigh risks actually getting virus.  shocked throughout pandemic we've meager studies actual efficacy masks real world. cloth mask BFE 98% surgical mask - considered 'face coverings' studies. Occasionally make distinctions N95 (which often poorly QC'ed KN95). whole thing immensely frustrating totally lacking real scientific rigor. point. limited number mutations stumbled upon virus advantageous spread evasion neutralization vaccines immunity prior infection. need tamp numbers quickly possible, finite amount alterations made spike ceases function virus. Oh nonono, full credit completely goes 5 people. paid Go Fund doctor died US help pay funeral costs. think even born started medical school either.

She one people denying virus misfortune working long hours hospital possibly getting looks like must large initial viral load hence dying 20s.  chance needing take work vaccine side effects they've heard think virus likely bad towards them?

Every shot needs come $500, free week work, blank check medical bills order get people take damn shots.  everyone think fuckin private jet? I'm rich! Georgia's cases decline two months. Yup, groups within community/city/state continues rage. One person variant going go church, especially churches, like 50% people church vaxxed, hour later 20,30,40 infected people take homes. 

You need doses effective variants, 55% people 18 2 shots. lot new potential victims. 55% vaccinated make remaining 45% much less vulnerable variants. 80% 2 doses, well maybe... thing going stop.  I’m ok it. Wow, grats. made exact pedantic point 5 people thought thought up. must proud.  Yeah, current gen Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, JJ, Sinopharm, Sputnik, etc 300 per day. That’s count bad flu season. right borders still closed present. That's I'm saying though. let either regardless whether vaccinated.

My number one concern open, visiting places without full vaccination result us quarantine upon return, vaccinated not. anything written stone, risks government willing take far less US government.

For example, last hard lockdown ended week ago applied *everyone* applicable area regardless whether vaccinated. kind nothing ordeal here, every man approach.

There times could travel around country freely, I'm sure back table next week two. also able go to/from New Zealand good (and think recently opened back up). Currently wear masks outdoors, stay home, etc. I'm well aware status things States talk American family, co-workers, friends every day. know need masks anymore, travel, etc.

And yeah, I'm next age group allowed vaccines, supply shortage seems, knows be. What? anyone eats babies it’s fuckhead private jet Move Texas want state government tell get fucked Covid ruined economic livelihood. dare sir! Jeff Bezos saint would never need 3 people week fulfill capitalistic need flesh. Feeling euphoric mean USA 5 times population UK? say children get way Actually, no, risk severe case increased due asthma per study (linking commentary science moderated covid sub): I'll cross bridge come it.

No, declaring victory earlier relaxing rules mistake myself. I'm losing sense taste smell anyway help it. many Foxnews addicted friends mock think COVID big deal.

Im india, almost family members got covid caught delta variant including kids, recovered within week something.  ronco rotisserie Okay yeah that’s confused lol. anyway, think there’s real potential get 500 million vaccinated end year.

Oh yeah. bad meant half billion. vaccine reducing transmission. flu vaccine something people take. typed, “I can’t see half million people getting vaccinated end year,” makes sense. burden healthcare.

That's new one. basically free loader benefiting everyone around vaccinated.  16% one dose 3% full vaxxed. That's lot. 8 million nothing India's population. would vaccinated lot people now.

Nah, reason limited 'at risk' age groups limited supply. Opening everyone change numbers much, would cause even longer wait times. absolve central govt whatever actions took, stupid ones I've listed? almost two factors ""trust government"" ""having seen many close relatives get sick die"" impact vaccination willingness... ""Vaccines effective anyway""

People hesitate, get sick, generate variants better evade vaccine, pass vaccinated people.

""Vaccines effective anyway"" God Florida fucking sucks  One year ago South Korean government also would freaked many cases now. wave hit level acceptable daily cases increased.

Also really doubt previous SARS exposure changed anything, less 10k confirmed cases worldwide. rare opposition go stupids blew getting vaccine start dying it.

At least Russian people damn good excuse rates high - distrust government there. vaccine rolled record time buttfucked Russia actually getting vaccines, right now, trust government reached record low   think without high rate vaccination area, you’re setting another spike Delta variant sweeps country. 

It already doubled infection rates Europe. It’s matter time til spreading widely rural America too. vaccinated areas won’t see dramatic spike fatalities resistant vaccines get hammered like people traveled congregated thanksgiving Christmas 2020  [As 14 June, 73 deaths England people confirmed Delta variant died within 28 days positive test, these:

Use brain second. CDC needs meme army  become resigned believe things fantasy?  I'm Missouri. town friend in? confirmed Delta variant? How's doing? think. least would.

We really care asymptomatic non-infectious breakthrough cases though. Like, point vaccine prevent disease, doing. 

If start seeing symptomatic breakthrough cases, there's evidence spread via breakthrough cases, boosters something.  you’re US country it’s extra hard get vaccine get J&amp;J. 

You’d miss July waiting Pfizer first dose like 38% effective. J&amp;J you’d like 64% past 4th. becomes determined need sort booster rollout infrastructure fast enough US. 

There misconceptions efficacy J&amp;J. go page 34 CDC overview 
You see efficacy actually continues increase past 14 days, lower number submitted phase III trial couldn’t obviously wait 57 days out. You’d 76% even got 2nd Pfizer.

However don’t mind waiting month that’s fine too. I’d rather something sooner delta variant starting go around. Overpopulation red herring. advocating population controls response “overpopulation” believing Malthusian trap borders advocating eugenics “over” populated countries (namely poor ones). reality small population rich people, predominantly wealthy countries directly indirectly responsible outsized amount pollution environmental degradation. global society equitable richest didn’t live excessively, wouldn’t issues facing terms “destruction”. undercook fish? Believe not, jail. Vaccinated Californian here. state mask mandate lifted, back now. Tonight work, picked groceries wear mask, to. Felt like reaching milestone, cuz was.

Tomorrow next night fellow fully-vaxxed coworker friends gonna grab drinks. bar. Inside. full capacity.

As someone stayed distanced stayed away medically compromised family always wore mask public respected gravity whole pandemic, I'm hyperbolic say awesome. big.  variants “pick off” vulnerable. That’s defines vulnerable. Better nothing, I'd still take it. noted paper peer-reviewed yet. “You really careful statements made papers haven’t vetted,” Holbrook said.

As someone goes church, I'm afraid number optimistic :(

Anecdotal course dad hardcore negationist antivaxxer. got first dose Sunday (basically soon could).

If 20 still parents tell instead thinking head need grow up. European here, went huge spike, areas delta variant increased cases hundreds percent. Season seem matter much here. New variants contagious lethal, get following evidence. Younger people making majority hospitalizations. Again, dont expect information make it’s way beyond screen you’re reading on. drink shots (which 1 1.5 fl oz) stopkas 50ml (1.7 fl oz) common. Vaccinated people tend get mild COVID. also lose brain tissue? I'm foreigner Russia vaccinated sputnik soon available. Like said, vaccine technology extremely well established, I've read peer review literature top vaccines. would take offered. *laughs Delta* Considering vaccines work basically variants, I'm sure fine. seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

Once sputnik vaccine available though, government seems backed attempt restrictions. Even recent restrictions 'mildly' enforced. Aye. Definitely get vaccinated, I'd caution use data say flu. Even mild cases result brain probably want avoid virus even fully vaccinated. Weird title. guy's uniform says охрана (security), think qualifies ""prankster."" Mild cases still cause brain warrant investigation celebration. do? lockdown another year? I’m trying flippant, I’m genuinely curious alternative is. wife staggered it. Even though J&amp;J Pfizer accounted schedules potential downtime. Even get Covid don’t die end hospital unless you’re asymptomatic you’re likely downtime well, likely vaccine. wonder means mild cases among vaccinated? vaccines still protect brain damage, lock downing tie sh!t virus.  burned people countries care type government runs country long keeps sight interfere daily lives. Governments take care keeping roads passable state, remove garbage basic policing. Anything else seen authoritarian. 

This mistake Soviet Union satellite states. amount BS people endure daily made unpopular. also reason many people oppose dislike covid related rules. fuck government tell wear face? many people meet? dictatorial Well that’s good sample all. America’s biggest spike January, nobody vaccinated. probably makes least half ‘99.75%’. need sample last month something gotta say, x-ray vision awesome extremely American-centric. know delta variant didn’t mutate unvaccinated Americans, right? India, couple percent vaccinated. Variants poor unvaccinated countries 100x likely harm Americans long run else going show new Botox injections?! Yup. Remember went away election? Good times. Ever heard Northern Ireland? Given it’s around months, especially time UK, absolutely would heard kids risk before. they’re not.

(It was, again, Capitalism) Cuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz we’re stupid!!! don’t evidence yet variant worse outcomes kids variants. 

I know everybody wants right kids numbers don’t lie: covid particularly dangerous children. total, 322 kids (17 younger) died covid US. That’s 74 million kids. odds kid dying covid extremely small. It’s comparable odds dying pneumonia influenza, two diseases probably never lost sleep before. Yes course poor health outcomes besides death covid true pneumonia flu, again, probably never lost sleep those. 

Humans bad analyzing risk. Covid literally tens thousands times dangerous old kids. take deep breath recognize covid isn’t serious threat children.

I could easily say:
Americans think world flat! [insert link American flat earther here] Cases falling quickly Germany think vaccines might outcompete Delta resurgence, cases halved last week instance. clearly talking cases said was, ""Every state south, outside Arkansas, flat showing decrease.""? That's obviously clear cases hospitalizations decreased. got caught reaching.

The article implied states south showing rebound cases/hospitalizations. true irresponsible reporting. got sudden urge buy Xbox series x Microsoft 365. see cases flat. see 7 day rolling average moving low 400s low 600s month. That's exponential growth starts. Slowly. suddenly isn't.

If Australia cases like India sure, take AZ (or proven vaccine) asap. Sign up! There’s couple things confounding clear picture states.

All  Boosters … okay … glad thinking … going get everyone US vaccinated first. Science delivered … safe, effective vaccine. government delivered … vaccine available, free. many countries world lucky ravaged COVID right now. US people snubbing vaccine millions.

What wrong? think said employee one exposed vaccinated, outbreak across 2 departments.

So shouldn’t mean total 1 vaccinated employee across (at least) 2 departments?

Or understanding wrongly. What? thing is, still concern greatly. current vaccines developed weeks virus appeared; took months months proving they're safe effective. we've proven that, I'd expect boosters come *much* quickly vaccine-escaping variant arise.

You understand concept 'two weeks slow spread', right? Yeah, pretty much. might phrase English slightly differently got gist nicely. study pointed possible preexisting immunity coronaviruses, sars. Remember, Covid supposed novel virus preexisting immunity. Yet strong t-cell response people sars previously Covid. 
I linked study comment. trending up, cases would increasing, decreasing. daily case rate currently averaging 11,822. 27,585 May 21, 65,619 April 21. Every single day seeing daily average fall.

If R0 greater 1.0, would case. Ideally would want world-wide scale allow complete eradication virus. Going essentials? lol

I'm sure they're paying someone else shopping them. got covid many times means immune system insanely defective see primary doctor. follow reasoning all. common target protein flu vaccines hemagglutinin, pretty close *functional* analog SARS-Cov-2 spike. mean subunit vaccines often primarily use HA proteins target epitope, HA ligand host cell surface receptor.

Your reasoning applied would appear suggest that, antibodies generated flu vaccines typically anti-HA antibodies, HA acts direct interface virion host cell, therefore case vaccines cannot become ineffective. HA mutates escape antibody recognition would also lose activity ligand, right? 

This clearly case, demonstrated year year. risk sounding trite, evolution smarter are. know LOTS people trying convince one last stubborn relative get vaccine.  Damn, AZ low. AZ 1st dose &amp; Pfizer 2nd dose? UK, hasn’t given J&amp;J vaccines, that’s it’s article. Whilst approved weeks ago, UK JJ hand use. much lower (by 5x more), deaths tend lag cases. Unfortunately [one case trends like delta variant seems driving resurgence cases despite widespread vaccine deployment UK, bad news. consolation seriousness cases (i.e. hospitalizations death) remains low, hopefully due vaccines. hard sure point.

Less ppl vaccinated Florida = masks. Yeah seems pretty universal. Even surge predictions experts saying they’ll maybe 20% witnessed last winter terms metrics. dig detail. right they’re saying “cases trending X state!” look it’s maybe 5% higher average still flat real alarming growth. think they’re hunting clicks. downplaying risk looking present really seeing anything push fear over.

People wanting everyone get vaccinated trying keep getting sick infecting others.  Even vaccinated? See article 😉  79% protection delta better nothing it’s good I’d like

""This study suggests BNT162b2 vaccine prior SARS-CoV-2 infection effective subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection COVID-19–related outcomes. Moreover, effectiveness seems similar cohorts. puts question need vaccinate recent (up six month) previously-infected individuals.""

Note that, like long term vaccine efficacy studies, say 6 months six months data available. correct focus Delta variant, article mentions next method used immune system protect variants. 

The cell mediated (t-cell) response protects variants true natural immunity vaccines. info assembled linked main point post, vaccines targeted spike protein Delta variant false premise. vaccines targeted spike protein original COVID, variants. spike protein part mutation Delta, t-cell response important. 

The issue going run data non-hospitalized COVID infections vaccination longer counted numbers, recovered individuals test positive counted reinfected, even symptomatic hospitalized. Using method always show higher number reinfections, even true reinfections rate   1. Vaccines aren’t perfect still (small) risk vaccinated people, becomes smaller smaller people vaccinated. others said, spreads likely mutate find ways around vaccine (or previous infection) immunity.

2. large growing body evidence vaccines significantly lower actual infection risk lower viral load one become “infected,” factors significantly reduce spread. “it stops symptoms” thing false narrative early vaccination campaign simply wasn’t enough information yet say one way another. opinion, messaging quite poor, even though rooted erring side caution.

3. don’t really know means. cares strangers wear masks? get vaccinated, masks overkill/provide little benefit situations opinion, don’t care others want wear take shower. question makes suspicious questions disingenuous. clear disconnect science Media/politicians fearmongering

Edit: also numbers going doctors rarely testing (see OPs comment). family member similar situation - finally tested took lot fighting pcp much protection covid someone got 2nd dose 1 week? know data fully vaccinated individuals (pfizer specifically) 2 weeks 2nd dose. Anyone know much protection 1 week mark?   still try wear mask sake daughter. Every time leave house face covered, actually anticipate someone yelling something me.

Johns say degree certainty vaccinated people unlikely spread COVID unvaccinated individuals?**

 
The emerging data confirms many us thought would case—that vaccines stop symptomatic COVID, also make highly unlikely someone even infected all. 
***I think preponderance evidence supports fact vaccinated individuals able spread virus.*** Remindme! 14 days Spain, king head state commander chief still waited, least theory. personally think probably vaccinated early got placebo front cameras, knows.

Anyway, think second paragraph crux issue. European countries (including Germany Spain) overwhelming majority people want vaccinated ASAP, people fight appointments (I can't wait get vaccinated), politicians going first would seen privilege frowned upon. US many people reluctant vaccination, makes sense politicians set example. Yay science! Straight jail, straight away... 1) Vaccination 100% protection. like wearing condom using pill birth control. Wearing condom alone likely good enough, maybe REALLY want get pregnant risk it. people, condom sufficient protection vaccine sufficient protection worry it.

2) False. initial studies looked symptoms narrative holdover that. vaccines reduce spread.

3) I've worn short periods time driving. minor inconvenience wear long periods time like glasses hat. still realize sometimes thinking it. I've gotten car, started heading road, remembered took off. may also going one place need another need mask, bothered keeping take off? keep shoes driving, coat driving winter, etc. need car also need take off. gauge 2018 flu season, around 81,000 deaths one worst flu seasons recorded recent history US. averages around 200 deaths per day. Seasonality must considered, must current circumstances regarding COVID - deaths steady, downward trend, evidence supporting seasonality established (yet.) continued precautions outside societal norms continue, require stronger justification point, already know society general considers even peak flu season - well 300 deaths day - acceptable number deaths acceptable risk exposure without altering daily lives.

In words, hit 200 deaths day, hard pressed convince need wear mask distance others previously normal, especially since vaccinated. want to, anything extra feel compelled protect you, me. That's probably OG - results trials. would presumably small drop-off Alpha slightly larger one Delta. Still good protection though, risk symptomatic disease possibly enough allow circulate even full vaccination eligible population. Anyone decide stop apathetic health, point. say fruitless definitely defeatism. saying injection stops spreader??

what think vaccines vaccinated travelers less likely get spread*** SARS-CoV-2 travel low risk within United States. International travelers need pay close attention situation international destinations traveling due spread new variants burden COVID-19 varies globally. kids aren’t vaccinated going get hospitalised new one??

How German vaccine authority say american people? Also (yet) seen rise deaths. see cases age group gov dashboard, although available  sure?

The article analysis included 14,019 cases Delta variant – 166 hospitalised – 12 April 4 June, looking emergency hospital admissions England.

I would read tracked 14.019 cases people testing positive delta variant. positives tests good sample work from.

How would interpolate general population, make assumptions likelihood vaccinated catch virus altered would likely surrounded vaccinated people vaccinated.

And would state study based whatever actual vaccinated population assumed baseline could infected.

I genuinely know would love get sources data leading 40% value. new voc appeared 6 month surge area showed in. conjectured one evolved within single host fight virus, though real evidence. one largely unmutated classic lineage parent (B.1.1, B.1, B.1.1.28 instance), ""second generation"".

If pattern holds set third generation lineages evolve bit, hard know they'll different. second generation already reached peak fitness within single host, maybe next generation possible. maybe viral replication rate escape continue rise. Co-infection two voc's within single cell also exchange mutations, could accelerate process (I would assume delta+ happened). dont want Laschet become new Bundeskanzler :( total ""yea sayer"", even worse Merkel. Sitting things out, backbone.

The vaccination center site NRW isnt even usable bot/script, 100% closed since May. spare left overs refresh get lucky, no, closed.

Just total joke NRW handling it. Thank you, I'm working it! pandemic stumbling block me, many millions others.

That seems kind irrelevant actually also kind wrong.

It's right word - vaccinated work well them. Fully vaccinated passengers exempt. Sounds fair  you’re saying every single individual doctor important country’s success pandemic Prime Minister? really believe saying it’s convenient argument?

If believe Prime Minister least important individual health care professional got early vaccine, must believe health care professionals shouldn’t gotten early vaccines order logic internally consistent. CureVac different Moderna Pfizer mrna vaccines CureVac use pseudouridine two use it. people suggest could account difference effectiveness:   keep telling fuckin family get vaccine won’t info got Facebook said bad, I’m one family gotten vaccinated, unfortunate.

For us young children, we'll continue careful, hey love kids I'm sure us cool that. always thought 

18-25 young adult

26-39 adult 

40-59 middle age

65 - 74 Older adult 

75 older- vulnerable older adult/elderly Interesting context prior findings vaccination studied Pfizer/BioNtech

[The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine SARS-CoV-2 reprograms adaptive innate immune confirmed BNT162b2 vaccination healthy individuals induced effective humoral cellular immunity several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated production inflammatory cytokines innate immune cells upon stimulation specific (SARS-CoV-2) non-specific (viral, fungal bacterial) stimuli. response innate immune cells TLR4*
and TLR7/8 ligands lower BNT162b2 vaccination **while fungi-induced cytokine responses stronger** like we've known US months testing. good getting backing it, though. virus get ONE shot mRNA vaccine 6 months later.

All saying lot individual cases make hard get proper statistic evaluation.  Yeah theres alot inbred racist white people believe anything read us. everyone get vaccinated. WHO's recommendation part limited global supply vaccine worldwide, priority given adults, likely die COVID. recommendation change soon enough global supply vaccinate every adult. can't eradicate disease long children remain natural reservoir.

The CDC American Academy Pediatrics recommend children 12 get vaccine. US high supply, seem mood give supply away, might well give kids 12 up, demonstrated safe.

I think US would wise vaccinate world excess supply. Easy international goodwill, reduces effects variants developing might harm us.

As claim kids really get sick COVID, one knows long-term effects pediatric covid might be. Strep throat cause renal failure, heart valve problems, even OCD, discovered decades later.   could easily eradicate 80-90% worlds population got vaccinated. can’t get rid people won’t. time reclaim it. lakh valid, laksha even valid original word. lakh really illegitimate derivative &amp; original.

Sure. compare anything I’m sure means much say Japan’s vaccine rollout much brisker OECD member Slovenia’s, compare closest economic peers. depends Delta mutation RNA strand mutation effects spike composition location. mutation drastically changes spike proteins recognized vaccine, immune system going start again. seems Delta similar enough vaccine immune system recognize though, maybe possibly quickly efficiently? They're still parsing out.

As completely naive immune system (never infected, never vaxxed) looks like Delta outcompeting earlier strains winning infection race. seem ""dangerous"" per se, infectious exactly. 50s 60s structural issues prevent proper diet proper exercise, means likely things younger reaping consequences. 

No one's telling 60 year old start crossfit, damn sure start things 30s, great shape later years, even limit things due wear tear. consistency safety. 

yes people issues despite everything they've done, likelihood it'd much worse taken care themselves. mutation. left unchecked could end mutating among kids something could effect more.

As moment Kids seem get severe side effects even though contract easily. simply could get enough tests didnt capacity large scale PCR testing

Nah, Germany could get tests, UK could well. actually back UK government still tried push rug.  thanks  lot blame goes parents well, fact barely 12-15 year olds gotten first doses ridiculous media crying ""OMG vaccinate kids we'll die!"" person friend/acquaintance, choice affect life, I’d say let want.

If it’s family member trying convince everyone household stay another year despite vaccinated, I’d say sit try come compromise that’s let resume semblance normality still taking concerns account. Moderna Pftzer use less spike protein stimulate immunity. It'd really surprising different variant. 75% Americans overweight

I thought pulling figure air believe high [holy read headline, congratulations, read rest article. bad people responsible misinformation vaccinated.

The US almost twice infant mortality Cuba. Despite Cuba developing country, health system closer first world standards many aspects. vaccines (like pfizer one) contain sucralose, lipids types salts. might bad sandwich... Pfizer Moderna yet. Unfortunately vaccinated also suffer immunodepressed fucked (a third dose known help one yet giving them). Philippines, COVID-19 cases topped 1.3 million. sprawling metro Manila area. Reporter Ashley Westerman recently tagged along local team emergency medical responders working hard keep non-COVID patients hospital.   think everyone else covered 1 2 pretty well. 3, definitely would drive around wearing mask vaccinated mask mandate. Why? lazy constantly take put back on. want either off. keeping make statement anything like that. lazy. true. Many people blood cancer develop antibodies 2 shots still need masking + distancing. Source: CLL, blood cancers, immunocompromised individuals chemo. That’s viruses work lol, aren’t concious can’t “practice” attacking immunized people find workarounds. chances ever getting past vaccines incredibly low. even manage already boosters ready go, they’d need reverse engineer specific variant would take maybe week. *Mostly* over, Patrick. Please expose unnecessarily, wear mask indoors people may may unvaccinated.
Be safe. begining end see it? Same. nothing new, knew trial results. UK similar problem different vaccines used. lower efficacy vaccine people need vaccinate, seen Brazil town vaccinated 75% Chinese vaccine worked. seems use last sentence comment racism. :/  talking about? can't. distribute fast enough shrug.jpg

Corruption government bad huge delay getting first shipment AZ. got pushed back like.... Half year Thankfully seem like people recover sense taste point. Soon hold hands federal government bail out. would likely give even better protection, question really necessary?

J&amp;J seems give good enough protection known variants, especially terms protection serious disease. Maybe second shot e.g. mRNA vaccine could warranted would emerge new variant immune escape, today. don’t know folks wearing n95’s also, typical masks worn people. don’t help much preventing getting sick. Certainly second injections stop getting sick spreading. vaccines greatly reduce chances severe symptoms, makes sense use incentivize people get vaccinated.

Older relatives may may vaccinated. bet anti-vaxx sentiments often shared among family members. Even not, older relatives may immunocompromised, even vaccinated, would still protected they'd like be. addition, vaccines bit less effective emerging delta variant, want multiple layers protection (i.e. vaccine + masking + public health measures) keep bay.  Remindme! 14 days 1. isn't. There's good news every day.

2. that's news reporting sells.

3. Two years pandemic cure scary shit.   one extrapolate results guess coverage might 1 Pfizer 1 AZ shot? That's even important reason, especially since actually waited manufacturing even though paid start ahead (the manufacturing ramp came 3-4 months approval, could happened approval least right after).

What really sped rampant virus was. That's made phase 3 efficacy trials short ended waiting safety trial (which time based).

If covid controlled everywhere world, eradicated, we'd waited years vaccine. accurate. 

I would add, however, every comparable study I’ve seen original strain variants looked Moderna Pfizer nearly criteria, results within margin error. Meaning intents purposes ~~had~~ efficacy. difference 95.2 94.1 isn’t actually difference statistically speaking. confidence interval could flip either direction. 

The **only** study I’ve seen significant difference two study efficacy 3 weeks dose 1. Moderna considerably effective hospitalization Pfizer (about 10-15 percent remember correctly). IIRC, explained Moderna shots larger dose vaccine Pfizer. 

While it’s science works, offered bet whether Moderna numbers within 5 percentage points Pfizer data, I’d make lot money betting are. shes sick probable covid since circulating UK states vaccines highly effective said variant two doses. point continuous click bait articles getting old. Vaccines analysis suggests:* 
 
*the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 96% effective hospitalisation 2 doses* 
*the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective hospitalisation 2 doses* vaccine 100% effective real world. think vaccines real hospitalizations original variant, mean happen broad usage since different variables accounted for: different chance spreading due different government measurements COVID, different body types etc. [This sums  Absolutely friend. I'm glad experience mild comparison that's bragging, means, I'm totally ok that. mother died early 2000s health insurance company cut cancer treatments. Obamacare since made lifetime limits illegal, suspect she’d survived happened recently.

Still, think statement needs qualified. two dose numbers much smaller error bars, seen PHE.

For Pfizer, range 86-99% effective. huge range. say 97.5% certainty vaccine least 86% effective hospitalization. Fear mind killer Actually Pfizer trial started counting cases 1 week second dose. Efficacy 94% 95% Yeah still air.

We analyze tone COVID-19 related English-language news articles written since January 1, 2020. Ninety one percent stories U.S. major media outlets negative tone versus fifty four percent non-U.S. major sources sixty five percent scientific journals. negativity U.S. major media notable even areas positive scientific developments including school re-openings vaccine trials. Media negativity unresponsive changing trends new COVID-19 cases political leanings audience. U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories COVID-19, negative stories general. Stories increasing COVID-19 cases outnumber stories decreasing cases factor 5.5 even periods new cases declining. Among U.S. major media outlets, stories discussing President Donald Trump hydroxychloroquine numerous stories combined cover companies individual researchers working COVID-19 vaccines. choose bodies even kills millions people. Every person died COVID-19 died someone COVID-19 infected them. Today, cumulative total 3.9 million children, women, men worldwide died COVID-19. one dead got COVID-19 infection different person, dead arguably killed 3.9 million people infected COVID-19.  
     
Some people infected COVID-19 arguably might infect others, arguably many do, including superspreaders infect large number persons, case happy, friendly, healthy-looking, well-dressed person unknowingly infected COVID-19 traveling crowded train lot people partying Washington DC New York.  
      
After superspreader reached destination, person became visibly sick tested positive COVID-19. team medical investigators contact tracers quickly found, identified, tested 50 people superspreader contacted unknowingly infected train trip. 
        
Nobody knows many infected strangers, neighbors, coworkers, family members, others might circulating among us, appear happy, friendly, beautiful, handsome, but, unknowingly infected spreading virus sicken, hospitalize, kill, cause long-haul COVID us contact unknowingly infected person. 
      
Arguably, persons infected COVID-19 superspreaders. infected persons knowingly unknowingly might infect 0, 1, 2, number persons.  
       
One thing COVID-19 certain become infected, become sick, become hospitalized, airtube snaked mouths lungs suffocate struggling breathe lying unconscious ICU bed, die COVID-19, develop long-haul COVID, infected stranger someone familiar, knowingly unknowingly infected COVID-19. 
        
That's main requirement getting COVID-19. Someone infect you, someone unknowingly infected friend unknowingly infected stranger. Flip coin.   
      
Sadly, observed friends relatives seem upset death loved one died COVID-19 think one person infected deceased. Like OK someone recently known infected COVID-19 realizes infected person within family, person died COVID-19 nineteen days later. 
      
They act like long friend relative one infected deceased, bad. kind OK. one quiet family things. go away while. 
        
But, might sad knowing many strangers someone infected someone realized infected tested positive, many strangers died COVID-19 someone given them. seems may shortage people know infected, seem little concern many strangers people might infected, many people ended $200 thousand hospital bill, ended dead hospital, ended suffering agony, pain, indescribable hell unending suffering long-haul COVID. whole life
uhoh took full 48 hours feel better, thanks chiming in, curious see things go 20+ 30+ age bracket. Ultimately, interesting see data comes links side effects immunity. Agasint delta? think data yet. studies seen produce strong response covid, even better 2 shots az. School starts back around aug11.  Except every vaccine ever produced long-term side effects become apparent within first two months so. Considering technology vaccines, feel like should/would/could change serious vaccine side effects history caught within six weeks, said Dr. Paul Offit, director Vaccine Education Center Children's Hospital Philadelphia member FDA's Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory ""I would say, please tell vaccine ever shown cause long-term side effect picked first two months,"" said Offit, co-creator rotavirus vaccine studied vaccinology four decades.   looking data month ago that's uptick started UK vaccines become effective overnight. 


One month ago, 34% adults UK fully vaccinated, many less effective AstraZeneca vaccine. Saying 80% Adults vaccinated misleading. 'reluctance' may even aspect.

For last year half, CDC, agencies also crowing loudly younger people far less likely serious complications. may, time, created sense security going haunt young people.

The messaging, least USA, terrible Biden previous admin.

I hope change minds, many people, young healthy, face possibility life-crippling complications could easily avoided.

Anecdotal, kids, 28 30, damn excited get vaccinated day able so. could gone one local super-sites run military, late night, rumors taking walk-ups ages true. thought unfair, case someone older needed vaccine.

Hope like hell change numbers poll. country given large amounts J&amp;J? used Canada. someone beats berates year, going believe say love twice. No, I’m arguing that. argue that? I’m saying original article absurd.

It’s interesting though, actually read article umass medical center? article doesn’t actually say headline says says. says hospitalization rates vaccinated people Covid low, doesn’t directly compare unvaccinated people. Again, I’m arguing vaccination (I’m vaccinated). it’s strange article shared would intentionally vague data. said ""may"" need booster. definitive statement. Data AZ shot #1 mRNA shot #2? concern here. idea kids spread Covid-19, get sick gross misinterpretation information. 95% effective infection (unclear right means detectable infection symptoms.

The 95% efficacy trials specifically ""symptomatic COVID"". Pfizer trial designed study infections general, hospitalizations, deaths. Considering 3,000 January, yes, good news. People die every day, finally bringing number average (maybe less point). Apologies. news ineffective south African variant (not alpha).  I'd like know J&amp;J Vaccine fits this. guy really tough.. yet sometimes need people like that.  actually got month ago close contact somebody COVID exhibited typical symptoms Alpha variant (also dominant one live). 

I symptoms rapid tests negative. said get PCR test though. follow previous post. 


The introduction vaccines showed massive decline infections. Also approved, RCT's showed promising effectiveness. 




The introduction facemasks showed real impact numbers whatsoever, neither lifting mandates half states US march. 



Also, RCT's done prove effectiveness facemasks againt corona. 


So stand previous post, masks ineffective, vaccine way out.  Deligeries probably stay july since Pfizer behind even new schedule 95th confidence level 1 dose Pfizer 47%- 99%.

So 1 dose Pfizer likely somewhere range low approved, most-protective vaccine history world. 

Yeah...the sample size small make good conclusion. J&amp;J one shot vaccine? still get second dose mRNA vaccine? think so. headline statistics, also look infections rest article. infections themselves, vaccine efficacy ~88% pfizer 67% AZ Delta variant. IL hit 53% fully vaccinated. I'm pleasantly surprised looked like going top around 45ish% peak, seem long tail vaccinations. looks like good number people waiting convenient. 

All friends either got relatively early employment (medical mainly) drove rural areas demand lower. fully vaccinated April.  Many Vietnamese wear masks even now. Lots sniping online it. I’m heading week photos videos Vietnam FB groups. It’s generally outside though lounging front steps without masks, it’s unlikely make much difference. know outdoor transmission low. 

The idea Asians wear masks constantly always follow rules correct. motorbikes pollution, plenty still don’t, even now. also still go karaoke bars secretly parties homes- it’s news there. young, possibly pregnant women, I’m aware anyone advised avoid vaccination medical reasons. mRNA vaccines don’t contain trace virus, normal concerns infection don’t apply.

Hopefully Pfizer approved 2-11 year olds end year, infants pregnant women. even then, don’t think pregnant women discouraged getting it. think it’s like, think decide it’s right you. interesting thing got mRNA vaccine second dose, AZ first dose. public acknowledgement heterogenous dosing/vaccine mixing. know? thanks. either die/become permanently disabled, see enough friends die/become permanently disabled get vaccinated.

Young adults low risk... even know even it. Please stop fearmongering... Everyone knew even time. Britain testing people dying simply could get enough tests didnt capacity large scale PCR testing. Trump get vaxxed make pro vaccine statements? vaccines developed administration, assistance government charge of? get logic trump = antivax. Although I'll first admit ignore Trump says lol. I'd think anything trump administration could proud of, would vaccines.  96% time. Canada?

I think fine interchangeable! lucky get 2 doses Pfizer. That's funny thing, bet require masks said ""wear mask like"", large percentage people would wear them.

I even mind wearing one much, might even voluntarily overly crowded room. hate forced to. tested 1 each, there's every reason believe similar immunity someone 2 doses shot. so? one them. reduces hospitalisations thought vaccine keeps people hospital

In UK alone vaccine already prevented 42,000 hospitalisations. We’ve heard every variant yet nothing major changed.

Children continue wear masks case. like people aren’t vaccinated too. Yeah also imagine homogeneous official speaks less distinct layers 'we vs them' etc. directives coming EU level sure public response would much worse; luckily still strong nation states though homogeneity getting worse. afraid needle ventilator suffering long covid

Why everyone pull words ""Ventilator"" ""Long Covid"" tell people get it? young healthy, low risk Covid, even got vaccine, still catch Covid, get symptoms also spread older relatives increased risk

Older relatives would vaccinated they? word China'a licensed production Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine? 

I'm hoping ramp production it, clear Delta theoretical follow variants (and going to) running lesser efficacy vacs like tissue paper.  don’t know from. small town Ohio it’s back normal, it’s wonderful. be. be. Many parents aren’t antivax still wary Covid shot, Covid itself.

Yep see too. still common ""We know happen long term taking vaccine"". hear parents fully vaccinated. fear unknown (however improbable) much known quantity COVID. address. haven’t even first yet.., bit difficult I’m USA. 
UG. GOOD THOUGHTS. GOOD THOUGHTs too! Viruses aren’t alive, mutate randomly, Covid could also randomly mutate less deadly transmissible. value human lives suffering data points rather affect economy. speak Canadian who's lived California number years, attitude approach covid markedly different - even living bay area.  late 2023. risk less individual possibility spread, right? Deaths: 73

Unvaccinated: 34

73 - 34 = 39, 24 shows 2 doses 14+ days. 

For god's sakes....just admit fully read comment. EVEN wrong put ""unvaccinated"" Colum (I'm wrong anybody click link we've given)...

I STILL specifically explicitly gave 2 doses 14+ days number BECUASE, like you, thought appropriate metric.  telling accurate accurately quoting study, highlighting part thought highlighted.  simply read said. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean said it’s 95% efficiency, always said 20 times effective. 5 vaccinated infected covid compared 95 placebo group 100 infected covid third phase trial (at least that’s example use articles). 

I don’t really know exact efficiency 36% compared 47% death reported day.  around 90% sure. say it’s 96% efficiency hospitalization 2nd dose doesn’t quite add high death rate.

They use high death count vaccinated day reason freedom day (remove covid restrictions) UK postponed June July days ago.

Even it’s highly effective hospitalization, death rate stays high, still careful.  don’t want ppl go without masks parting read headline already received doses. majority adults intentionally put harms way. Hard find sympathy.  fair point people. really care nonvaccinated themselves, mutations threaten evolve uncontrolled potentially undoes progress us get vaccinated, think money talks. much flux. biggest issue going ""correct"" answer potentially late. describe plain accessible terms, anyway. People word ""variant"" part regular vernacular prior going universally understand means context. might understand different version, version came be.

In US least, vaccination rates per capita generally linked area's typical focus education spending levels. need make information digestible people poorer vocabularies lower scientific understanding.

Call ""mutations"". Make clear every time virus infects someone, chance mutate something else could dangerous. Regardless reading level, English-speaking world familiar ""mutant"" already, thanks X-Men.

We're speaking people level public discourse, that's problem. wife feel same, everything asked last year, youngest catch spending time right thing would blow.

Fuck people get vaccines wear masks refuse to. It’s less effective, although slightly, combined large amount unvaccinated people really makes delta variant concern. also potentially leads anther mutation people become reservoirs new viruses. Indeed. sole supplier delivered schedule. Yeah, sore arm second (J&amp;J) shot.   really apples apples schools closed great portion time well people wearing masks social distancing? 

The numbers kids probably best case given circumstances. fools need arrested locked  Thank you. try treat everyone I'd like treated. true I'm running business, renting home.

People forget landlords people, too. people give best effort honest fair me, I'll act same. tenants take rulers try play lawyer gets absolute minimum stipulated law.

It's everyone's benefit work together other. many people (landlords **and** tenants) take adversarial stance shows. Hopefully US give EUA Novavax fall. know handful people would take Novavax mRNA JnJ. as-in actually targeted people impacted covid / covid restrictions.

fixed income cap actually benefits GOP... CoL rural vs urban. even get started SALT garbage. think pushing vaccination primary provider's offices would help mass vaccination sites? People chitcat doctor, might able better convince get shot. Dont worry, delta variant coming  fully vaccinated Pfizer laying bed sick dog first time since January 2020 Reading like yay, forgot truly terrible non hospitalized sickness feels/is too. 
Feel like I’m fucking dying. 
Never going again.
I tried it, time assume final form agoraphobe.
This worth human touch Yes, that's many mutations fail never spread particular host population. mutate viability. would nice viruses this. Instead, come things like Delta, outcompeting inferior mutants. two countries backs US UN legitimacy Cuban Embargo, maybe turn mirror ourselves? thought. us.

&amp;#x200B;

*-agents assigned Fauci.* Ad vaccines list products can’t buy dollar store. Delta Airlines variant? Yes NRW disaster. Basically harass several doctors get chance go waiting list. get anything people got lucky accuse jot trying hard enough.  love comments fail realize UK’s hospitalizations barely budged vast majority hospital unvaccinated. There's swaying die-hard holdouts point. Unless say, perhaps, everyone vaccinated exempt income taxes three years. might it. far know children extremely low risk form covid Feeling like wrote comment, exactly thoughts... Uncertainity driving insane. quite lot vaccinated people around completely OK, time... man, made people give fuck health life general. znaet, koroche One dose, know you’re trying say, one dose aren’t protected anywhere near much, least going soon. others may never get there. republican states low vaccination rates (\~30%) gonna learn hard way. Take medical advice doctors, politicians. vaccines work delta Yes.

ok well end story then.
 
get vaccinated scary new variant rendered powerless 54% one dose 2 doses? actually makes lot sense, thanks gor clarifying. worst thing dying. fact, due restrictions implemented again. read Pfizer would easy modify mRNA . Would similar vaccines terms able tweak efficient future strains? Yet hospitalization vaccines ppl rising.   ""Almost cases unvaccinated people that, opinion, put harm's way pandemic.""

Missouri also one obese states nation. obese put harm's way every day, COVID-19, increased cancer rates, diabetes, poorer health newborn babies, worse outcomes virtually every area health compared people healthy weight.  person would've hit still way, yeah, stay stopped clear... 23rds Canadians fucking dumb fucks stupidity runs strong. ex-friend got COVID-19 twice!! Brought home wife. ended hospital. refuses stay stay home even though work. Plays guitar church sing. Goes eat almost daily (neither cooks). TWICE!!! Direct access medical tech/supplies, research, resources, expertise world difference restricting access WHO. 

Cuba sovereign nation that's built medical field covid vaccine spite economic sanctions. Taiwan sovereign nation sanctions ecomonic power house, readily purchase vaccines medical equipment. China's political involvement within territory comparable US/Cuba. 

If compare them, look forward post details similar. Steve Edwards CEO Cox Health, health network six hospitals 12,000 employees, headquartered third largest city state.

This tweet -  long covid? seeing reports people fully vaxxed still losing sense taste smell. mean hiding things? Vaccine patents? Pfizer/biontech heroes EU. Largest supplier steady one. Generally speaking, women also likely respond surveys men.

They also likely men.

Further, article posted mentions women making majority health care decisions house potential cascading impact vaccination efforts, would obviously make women key vaccinations efforts.

But importantly, study posted published January lists main reason women refusing vaccinations safety hesitancy based vaccine safety concerns dropped months following initial rollout. That's actually really making furious. spreading lie risks kids' health, also painting autism fate worse death. insulting, would hilarious. amount vaccination turn tide pod swallower Elon Musk. sounds like FDA isn’t confident enough authorize yet. general adult population, vaccine 1 million side effect, benefits far outweigh dangers. children, 1 million side effect might harm COVID. would need completely sure side effects don’t exist approving it. fact vaccine — adults rushing get save COVID — possibly dangerous children COVID really shows little affects children. two year old can’t vaccinated. I’m getting exhausted scared, starting feel better, scared again.  think Biden getting vaccination December dishonorable? prime minister dies takes election couple days get new one. doctor dies, takes 10 years train new one.

And elect doctor head state easier head state treat patients.  mean Cuba every opportunity reform government sanctions removed. It’s two way street. government chooses continue dictatorship knowing sanctions stay place. I'm Oklahoma masks never enforced people wear them, makes head spin. Congratulations. vaccinations going Japan? *greatly* appreciated, thank you. &lt;3   Flu deaths aren’t broke ages 18-30,

But ~2,400 covid deaths ages 18-30 roughly number flu deaths ages 18-49 **combined.** UK mostly used AstraZeneca vaccine lot less effective American vaccines. far know, contagious vaccines effective it.

if fully vaccinated, delta variant hype. mutation drastically changes spike proteins recognized vaccine [...]

Mutations can't change spike protein much, spike virus uses enter cells. right shape bind ACE2 receptors cells. changes shape spike prevent binding (in fact, certain changes may even help it), change much virus may end unable infect cells.  theory even better 2 doses one. drawback studies second dose could stronger side effects ( fever; body aches) live Canada. There's lots people said want kids want vaccine, think population control. everywhere, trust me. Table 4, shows deaths vaccination status. 

For Delta, 73. ""unvaccinated"", shows 34. vaccinated 39. 

Page personally broke gave last column, 14+ days second dose confuse anybody (24). 

You responded accurate gave 14+ days second dose like did. 

Again, STUDY included 1 dose part ""vaccinated"" group, gave, I, personally, made sure note 14+ days 2 doses group. comment objected. 

Is problem read entire (short) comment can't admit it? right. v2 versions papers make obvious accurate. Every phase 1-style study we've done shown exact thing. Head Pfizer thought end 2021 early 2022 2-12 year olds.  wonder people feel fact literally billions people received vaccine far? It’s spreading somehow. Far people obese covid. 

We need root branch review why, ways solve it. get ""the flu"" (who knows really is) usually sore throat first day, sore throat mild fever second, third runny nose sneezes start fever subsides. sore throat hit miss, sometimes goes away immediately, sometimes drags on. Never paid attention try avoid catching it, well unless someone actively trying sneeze face course.

In 2018 (I think? maybe '17) caught worst flu remember. sudden onset high fever, really bad headache, hungry eat anything entire day looking food made nauseus.  
The next day went supermarket buy fruit (I know, have, live alone. careful cough sneeze anything), put like 3 coats still felt cold.  
I standing line cash register suddenly vision started going grey. squatted knees came back still felt like going pass moment. 
I enough time pay getting throwing curb - thrown *years.* Basically nothing came except spit anyway since eaten all.  
I stayed curb good couple minutes regaining enough energy get walk car less 30m away. 
I felt like shit next 2 days starting recover, ate couple apples light fruit whole time.

Obviously nowhere near experience, there's question ""the regular flu"" absolutely still make feel like shit gets good. Endgame inevitably defenses erode, outbreak spooks people, vaccination starts going roof. Yes! hissy fit here! 

I somedays. Old ladies cranky! 
Peace everyone! We're entirely sure, likely animal trials early 2020 saw results one dose like something, tried second dose, got results thought getting.

The terms want search wanted information ""Prime Boost Vaccination"". context sorely needed conversations. difference 17% 20% America 10 million people. That's margin error. yet underexplored area research natural immunity vaccination seems less effective variants. Given natural immunity less consistent immunity vaccination, general sense variants effective natural immunity vaccination. Results Brazil particularly worrisome. Though, P.1 seems failing Delta.

Again, underexplored area research. time, clear unvaccinated generally bad lot questions bad might  Absolutely! 500 dollars maybe. 100 dollars, hell no. Americans already returning certain degree normalcy, think?

My county went plateauing 600 cases day start February early April plummeting less 30 cases day end May, period *loosening* restrictions almost exactly corresponds weeks vaccine became widely available. exactly ""herd immunity"", virus completely eliminated, clearly might factors involved. far tell actual examples places getting vaccinated, soon community becomes widely vaccinated, spread COVID becomes greatly inhibited becomes lot safer activities used super dangerous. Obviously exact % needs vaccinated COVID longer big threat would depend things like efficacy vaccine used, contagious local variants are, behaviors people community, weather, etc. vaccinations line goes COVID line goes pretty well established relationship point. think might missing - new variant introduced (especially deadly one.....) cases could still seen coming down, deaths could remain same. variant deadly preceeded it. (the deaths could even concievably go little depending severity) Meaning...cases could down, deaths stay rate not....go down...in way would expect. lot seem know going here. Though vaccine hesitancy sure, reason slow rollout. Japanese bureaucracy moves glacial pace solely responsible slow approval logistics vaccination process. end May big vaccination centers opened pace vaccinations increased reasonable levels.  key reasons get vaccine people around got vaccine risk lower. take second think world would look like everyone thought like you. like world? guess identify “fantasy” differently. don’t want people die. cherish life. That’s got vaccine. cherish life, even own. That’s get vaccine.

Fairly simple concept. Thanks reply. 

Sorry, I'm little confused. 
So saying vaccinated get Covid Asymptomatic?  reality almost surely this: Vaccine eventually get virus. made judgement time college, would say 25% undergrads around age neo-conservative. matches article lol, still significant amount world 39 year old person young adult? context, peak flu season kills every day. That's successful vaccines been. Okay... 

1) Even get hospitalizated, get long COVID, could months fatigue, loss taste, etc. active, long COVID could put ass months since lose endurance. 

2) COVID cases symptomatic. get symptoms likely get COVID. Further, vaccines provide much better coverage COVID previous infection. 

3) COVID cases may stay low forever, start increase probably late get vaccine since takes 6-7 weeks effective. 

4) go bars, restaurants, clubs, etc? so, risk COVID spaces. Also, vaccinated people spread it, less common. 

5) rate myocarditis still much lower rate severe COVID young, unvaccinated people. 

6) 2 days (1 shot) feeling bad much better COVID lasts 10+ days. Also, sounds like job gives good benefits, take off. 

7) vaccine ever effects take months/years show. mRNA leaves body couple days later. impossible, unlikely. 

8) I'm sure point this? want get political debate getting vaccinated hurts you, politicians. vaccinated immune, personally hurt get infected. 

I hope decide get vaccinated! people lessens risk spread entire community bring us closer ending pandemic worldwide. Also, since younger, antibody levels higher older people. Younger people best get vaccinated! 

I appreciate sharing reasons feel free PM want talk more. similar (young good shape) decided get vaccinated. usually go ourworldindata, lets select countries different “confirmed deaths” - “7-day rolling average” setting. You’ll see US still pretty high despite early vaccine rollout.    curiosity, govt paid 1000 dollars get vaccine would you?  Sympathy another fucking human being. far gone consider economic system somebody lives decide feel empathy  ""More likely"" ""wiped out"" two entirely different things. ""science"" ""following"" suggests COVID wipe given population people?  power process creating especially unrealistic improbable mental images response psychological need

""We’ll see happens anti-Vaxers get wiped out"" fantasy definition. ridiculous! Southern european countries religious, vaccination rates higher. bet american problem plain old arrogance. You’ve never Mexico, 2nd superstitious people ever met. flew solar eclipse every house closed shutters locked inside. construction unless there’s cross placed roof would, know wouldn’t. Save life; get jab. Changing mind getting vaccine hypocritical. That's word means. don’t fantasize. follow science. Anti-vaxers much likely die COVID get vaccinated. like they’re likely get polio small pox flu.  bald, open-faced fearmongering, honestly. data support doom calling. Even UK, Delta variant entirely dominant, cases barely rising, hospitalizations going anywhere, deaths single digits.

Among vaccinated, numbers look even better. Stupid people average children younger also less life experience raising them. can't get people properly wear masks take vaccine. There's way hell we'll get make major lifestyle changes.   That's lot words say ""I'm selfish care anyone myself"" mean it'll spread twice many people way. Since viral growth exponential reality means thousands times contagious enough spread time.

That 100% increase spread refers initial spread patient 0. compound increase time humanitarian catastrophe. know ""most""...but yes, country lot problems. suppose goes back slavery civil war.....(not caring entire group enslaved, normalizing suffering, animosity towards side thereafer well.)  Americans seem ""unite"" economic reasons, divided socially results popultion..having poor moral statements. Yeah. Speak yourself. care. child getting vaccinated next month, interested severe cases well prevalent. feel like ignoring context strategies discussed around **how get everyone vaccinated** needs accept 20% country divided rest us.

If want jump straight fines imprisonment, guess that's right hold opinion, think there's lot juice squeeze options would classify ""outreach."" Obesity infectious ban cars get car accident deaths zero. sounds like Ducey Hey, tried counting dead! making lot accusations resisting attempt pin exactly think done long. 2 cases yesterday. isolation since infectious period. looking promising NSW definitely less consistent immunity vaccines, seen nothing indicates variants better wild type causing breakthrough infections natural immunity. could really test vivo, they're thing circulating now, so...    bet really fun parties. Team variant full force sub past couple days. Technically isn't. I'm caught one industries gets hurt much worse help get population numbers control. Lockdown NOW. real one, China style, bs half-assed lockdown countries doing. That's way save lives fReEdUmB crybabies gonna get it. win. person lost 14 people life past 2 months.

Hope mom allowed near COVID vaccines. supposed tell you? life somehow magically like pre-Covid? watershed moment, like world war (and cases far devastating). We’re permanently changed circumstances. agree somewhat, I’d argue religious problem Americans take politics, left right, form religion. refuse vaccine masks show you’re true believer right, vocally support vaccines continue masking show you’re virtuous progressive.

And everything gets politicized. Masks working never political issue. Ya it’s lakhpati (and pati translates husband) long hard lockdowns continue? What's target goal would feel ok releasing them? know 112 deaths yesterday (June 20th) entire US. (Source worldometer)

You sure don’t want change claim won’t go 100. let concerts, college, jobs, sporting events unless vaccinated.

Wouldn't completely surprising, evidence? seen anything past last year's allegations hacking attacks. Sputnik V Oxford/AstraZeneca two-component vector vaccines developed almost time, use different adenovirus vectors. Sputnik first vector vaccine created Gamaleya Research Institute, like lack experience create it. considering AZ agreed Russia trials combined Sputnik+AZ shots, seem holding grudge either.

I used drive freeway see family lives hour away twice month more. enjoyed going bars old friends drinking Saturday away . miss taking girlfriend nightclubs dance . Hell world lockdown used one day Disneyland 3 day pass 2 days kind assume gone feel comfortable using anyway. 


I've spent majority past year largely locked apartment , sparsely heading freaking fuck forget mask walk two steps away front door.  


I need mental therapist got laid can't afford mental therapist got new job hope first real check months afford mental support. 


The amount people happy lockdowns small think mot lockdown supporters WANT locked . hopefully reduce spread, help manage vulnerable amongst population communities . rest us vaccinated intermingling possibly spreading virus want pretend gone bringing people vulnerable us acceptable eyes.  


Everybody keeps pretending like country vaccinated that's true significant portion accepted pursued vaccination everyone large pockets gonna ravaged delta , delta plus, inevitable delta ultra super max reason lockdown try beginning try curb spread...you know curb spread?  


Opening everything resuming life antivaxxers intermingle among us we're right back God forbid super resistant variant develops nothing.  


They say ounce prevention worth pound cure , Let's work prevent covid decimaitng us like 2020 . feel like we're groundhogs day people keep rooting dive back opening everything get see wave happen . ludicrous like shit going across world pretend show doorstep like EVERY SINGLE TIME 


I people want lockdowns accept alternative nightmare never get ""normal "" back work preserve little progress we've made.  


Australia lockdowns far restrictive suffered fewer casualties managed virus infinitely better us , returned version normalcy us envy longer periods us seen last year. 


We stop insanity insisting immediate normalcy actively making covid social effect worse every time.  Nice finally see acknowledgement evidence losing mind. Also piece emotional response new; figured depersonalization due gas-lighting. 

Here's hoping there's way reverse this... COVID dementia sucks.  Hope goes well! I’ve feeling like crap day ( feeling worse first AZ though ). Pfizer second. 

Hope don’t feel bad afterwards.  Scary think delta would ripped world back early 2020. Yeah, typo part - 59. Gen X Kennedy died onwards. never said same.  yep. count matter. old people, 50%+ people perfect health. 

The comments sub taught that. young, fit athlete-types matter....except bad reaction COVID, matter anymore since rare. welcome Fox News  make vaccine passports. Young people love travelling. Vaccine passports alone probably whittle 25% hesitancy rate 10% less. Wow, thanks. That's pretty close I'm after. feel way support mate 👍 know live, many people still voluntarily wear masks socially distance. California reopened six days ago. help Australia Russian skepticism authority century totalitarian dictatorships oligarchy, isn’t extreme religious fundamentalism, racism, conspiracism American right.  I'm arguing efficacy vaccines anything like that. I'm saying we're gonna ""overly cautious"" towards covid, virus low death rate, even lower people demographic, I'm going cautious regarding vaccines regarding health effects. make sense pick choose chose level scrutiny cautious. Covid effects small percentage ppl, vaccines. I'm going equally diligent There's lot it, see megacomment below. huge one links.

If good way say ""mixing vaccines doubling doses/vaccines dangerous, basically ever, time either, unless talked doctor (mostly wasteful necessary, vaccinated fine)"" fewer words, I'm ears. aren’t low hanging fruit options. They’re impossible, illegal, options. What!
Source vaccination covid recovery increases blood clots.
I take vaccine tomorrow did. governments. Taiwan example surge thought over. Many national international experts jubilant Covid India managed well. Govt appointed panels commissioned sero tests found 60-70% people Covid antibodies already. Infected people getting hospitals within day two. everyone became lax. People refused take vaccines. Doses thrown out. delta variant hit changed everything. Yeah I’m wondering well. pointing lot shitty things Trump did. arguing that. 

However, point make we're *now* (not could gotten bad) vaccine rollout. big vaccine distribution centers rolled almost state run, federal. (For instance, Dodgers Stadium clinic busiest clinic US run state). federal ones set rural areas primarily, main issue places supply, getting people willing. worth trying, kind wash. 

Mask wearing go Biden took office. Would higher president entire time? Likely. that's question. We're talking we're now. I'm saying Trump lot shitty things, I'm saying know Biden get us point much faster trajectory on. hit million shots day office, original goal reach first 100 days. What!
Source vaccination covid recovery increases blood clots.
I take vaccine tomorrow Congratulations recovery far best wishes going forward. incredibly self-righteous, you? Consider getting high horse.

The reason cases mean fuck causes mild bout sniffles, also known cold. vaccines best, rate 92% 96% AZ Pfizer respectively vs Delta, variant highest transmissibility (this mean 8%/4% become deathly ill either). impact clearly seen countries high vaccination rates, US, UK, Israel.

So, uninformed one here. world opening again, without you. personal kit test antibody level ? Lol, FDA looked yet? We’re everywhere. Death illness aside, things went still going AUS way miserable. top that, American ass worry friends family states.

Thanks recognising logic. whole point people shouldn’t dying amount death celebrated. I’m disgusted much opposition that’s met with. Newsflash: Every country world preventable deaths. see 118. States seem report thier numbers weekends, data dumps something Monday. CA had...620 cases yesterday...and today...1,214 5pm CA time. cases double 1 day. (if would bad sign....)   multiple states list thier totals seemingly Sundays, shows 0 but..the next day...a bunch. Michigan today 36, yesterday seemingly data. Colorado 32 far today...yesterday...a ""zero"" probably, data. go combined 0 68 one day.  Looking Monday's useful imo. (today far 196, ""double"" one day...its weird reporting weekends.) It’s three shot . Perhaps countries options might use it.  bad it’s clear effectivity might delta variants. Nope. Actually home grown vaccines expensive vaccines far. 

I think production capacity. China 1.4 billion population simply rely BioNTech promised 200 million shots China.  Hopefully things pick later week. I'm hoping 55% July 4th stole someone, maybe you!

I'm trying cover multiple bases though, including ""I got J&amp;J/AZ/Novavax, get mRNA booster?"" thing.

So fuller exploration questions warranted. want read parent develop antibodies vaccine... is, given place. Australia done it, really takes lot effort. hope US it, cause otherwise, somewhat sad timeline. risk Covid significantly higher whatever risk vaccine carries.

And notice rapid decline cases deaths Covid US right? think may ask you? booster works 2 doses current 2 dose vaccines still effective. less effective original strain, wild-type SARS-CoV-2, seems disappearing it’s replaced infectious strains. would like signal highest displeasure pandemic handled. given much social life year half. lost 42% income 2020 compared 2019. one seemed give shit. People canceled contracts could worked almost zero covid risk. behavior elected officials, health bureaucrats, media appalling. getting vaccine seems leverage them.

So method protesting Covid restrictions behave manner risks extending pandemic restrictions? really thought through?  Well people get vaccinated then. point it’s you’re adult get refuse. don’t feel bad people get sick die. made choice. shut why? people won’t get vaccine? Go away. then? Get vaccinated. Pfizer awesome. help figure second dose. delta vaccine works yet? large population zero natural immunity, vaccines lower efficacy, low vaccination rates 

What said applies Hong Kong. Pretty much telling happens leave decision freedumb loving mobs. ... like covid? chance anything bad happens demographic extremely low, get vaccine? I'm going apply high level risk aversion covid, I'm gonna vaccines I'd go Pfizer second  really tell concerned really about. 

They saw J&amp;j issue instantly paused looked more. fact taking serious stance shows big deal J&amp;J issue Sure that's 100% completely different argument population size. wonder today there'll new restrictions announced. mask mandate across entirety metropolitan area. Although said, influx cases yet. You’re risk far things compared whatever risk second shot Covid would bring. It’s astronomically low chance second dose anything bad Yeah real. damn health line. I'd appreciate hurry fuck maybe take holiday day Trump plan distribution. big public centers, example,. Biden did. 

Trump mostly telling people mask, use cures work actually hurt people, virus big deal. Biden.

Trump's administration literally stole masks protection states trying procure hospital staff others. told states buy own, states did, Trump's administration stole it, resold states. Biden would never anything like that. keep trying find affect children. kids 12 cannot get vaccinated yet mean them? demand freedom die burden society.

Most people healthy suffer lack health coverage. pool people life threatening diseases, much much smaller total population (although know exact number), 45 000 died directly lack healthcare.

For reference, ""only"" 3 000 000 Americans die every year. Lots due old age accidents factors, even then, 45 000 3 000 000 much higher scarier number 45 000 300 000 000. 

And finally, consider deaths preventable.

n c e Maybe messaging vaccine's efficacy better, headline. would vectored ones harder update? feel like either way you’re making changes DNA vector either stopping T7 transcription make mRNA. little downstream effects. Meanwhile protein production requires lot extra steps purification, yield checks, folding checks, etc. keep engaging logical fallacies instead proper discussion. problem saying we're herd immunity communities never able reach herd immunity. get outbreaks variants breakthrough people going say getting vaccine pointless work all. 


It's rising problem MMR TdAP vaccines. People think work there's outbreaks lack herd immunity community. they'll resist vaccines more. 150 million Americans fully vaccinated. exactly.

why hard people understand this? False mRNA definitely even easier. vectored inactivated are, theory, hard update. could end needing billions updated doses next year. get, better.  Soooooo much anger hatred. never thought wanting everyone safe healthy would offensive many. wrong. virus uses spike protein latch onto respiratory system cells. needs strong attachment can't deliver payload.

Detecting spike proteins also instructions vaccines do. order virus mutate way would hide spike proteins immune system, would also lose ability latch onto cells, process become virus cannot infect humans.

The ""choice"" try thread needle find least-detectable spike proteins still allow latch onto cells properly. far either direction makes either virus can't affect humans, can't spread humans, thus ending life cycle.

The Delta variant close ideal gets, finding efficient middle ground two extremes. STILL able evade vaccines.

We absolutely hit park vaccines, advantage 100% court virus now. not. also neither funded performed kind research. rare. area delta variant one doctor clinic already seen 6 covid+ fully vaccinated patients. Two husband wife pair. Elderly, otherwise immunocompromised.

That said, think data yet whether breakthrough cases get long haul symptoms. covid level year round rather seasonal? deaths? Old double vaccinated vs Young unvaccinated.

Fortunately state county seems decided yes, good idea, fortunately think point there's much chance getting it, that's luck are. hopefully there'll vaccine waiting he's 2. No, authors suggest getting vaccine. studies. Big difference. Yeah blown knees, hips arthritis etc.

In response ""next stop 200"" deleted post predicted deaths going stagnate around 300 long time, mentioned betting markets 50/50 deaths falling 100/day year. I'm going convention August. Freaking AUGUST! they're requiring masks everyone convention space, even vaccinated.

It's incredibly frustrating I've done part, got vaccinated, spent year wearing mask everywhere, much year locked down, yet people continuing obsess wearing masks even though numbers lower ever CDC says longer vaccinated.

I'd gladly skip convention social convention next chance see lot friends seen year. Maybe stop grumpy it, enough enough. Bro, [its well documented athletes struggled come back well conditioned human beings planet.

Probably safe assume \~90% + effectiveness. ACA Medicaid expansion kicked in? get lonely too, want see kids grandkids.

Also, old also generally means less worried death. going happen soon anyway.  hope to. trip planned September starting look kinda sketchy.

It’s 9% chance you’ll get it. chance getting 9% unvaccinated person, 100%. vaccine effective preventing asymtomatic spread! effective masking. data now.

I also care huge amount wearing mask--I still wear one store--but bigger issues bars, restaurants, theaters, etc. decimated last year. think almost reason avoid places post-vaccination think places allowed fully reopen--as already been.

Additionally, children 12 present, would feel guilt-free going maskless places. Adults cannot get vaccinated provide excellent protection *to themselves* N95s readily available again. going make changes behavior protect adults choose get vaccinated choose wear N95.  Even change must huge, deliver around 15M Spain deliver around 1,5M July send 13M following two months 754k vaccination far today, probably 24 hour vaccination 1.1 -1.2 million. well record 1.5m vaccination. vaccination eligibility lowered 18+ 2-3 days. 

Note: know Turkey's population. roughly 85m. hope so. UK airlines marching Parliament (our White House) tomorrow number considering suing government opening already I'm traveling work lately gotta say, wearing masks throughout airport plane quite annoying week week out. understand TSA extended masks thru Sept 13th, indication scrap rule that? head government getting second dose? Jennsen one? fact seen update new variants. Jensenners forgotten. That’s totally different problem. Australia bought enough Moderna, Pfizer Novavax vaccines vaccinate entire populous twice. 40 million Pfizer 10 million Moderna arrive December. needless say, people aren’t willing take AZ vaccine. actual Anti-Vaxers Oz mostly 30 somethings looks protests. 

Australia really open AZ everyone wants it. donate rest. months get Pfizer shot AZ sitting there. AZ provides higher protection two doses J&amp;J vaccine. many would without messaging? It’s like saying washing car every two weeks doesn’t help anything it’s dirty time. gets two free bags upgraded hospital room.   sub Nov 2019? Yes is, inhale virus sick person, suffer ill effects even real infection, exhale virus nearby unvaccinated person kill unknowingly

This doctors saying keep masking post vaccination think US waiting reciprocity. agree point clear. Delta variant casses growing exponentially UK. fact, although cases increasing, reduced heavily.

your nobel mail Four per cent confirmed cases Taiwan died. striking highly ratio. Apparently positivity rate low declining, unlikely missing many cases, healthcare overall quite good. strange response. say ""literally everyone going disability"" said may add millions. hundreds millions people US. fine. BUT, take ton long haulers start causing issues clinics, insurance, generally impact rest us. seem confident remains track meet quarterly delivery commitments European Union 2021, Company continues build supply chain  anti-vax anti-mask people dangerous link that? still can't believe 300 seen ""good"" news. even think know 300 people. Worse many places wearing mask adult felony. exception expires even allowed wear masks want Ask author, guess. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Yes. flu season killed 120K people US recent history. 

333 deaths day high end estimate exclusively 6 months flu season atypically bad flu season. typical flu season 175 deaths per day season, less 100 deaths per day averaged across year. 

The flu also single deadly infectious disease still present United States. So, today's 7-day average death rate, we're *still* 3 times worse deadly (at population level) infectious disease face. That's *after* significant proportion population vaccinated *and* seasonal factors favor. 

Of course, number continue go down. Deaths lagging indicator cases plummeting thanks vaccines. still dreadful number trying compare even today's death rate typical flu year misleading. Come back another month two deaths 100/day comparison may apt (ignoring seasonality). get quick test... cheap now... Yeah, refusers two groups I've seen - young crowd 40-50s conspiracy group. said, people older tune efficacy vaccines less likely conspiratorial experience. people 60 causing issues. lethal causes way infections cause severe outcomes. tell started coughing ask later, gave cold medicine Yeah, wish US government would see like that. UK announce travellers double vacinated test negative longer need isolate return. US allows travel UK double vacinated tested travelers, we'd good go! Fingers crossed within next 6 weeks Sorry dumb question, Pfizer effective reasonable assume Moderna equally effective since similar types vaccines? it’s shitty thing 54% population US far  Haha ,no  hand, rest world's failure contain coronavirus ultimately caused Taiwanese outbreak happen, I'd say rest world bit moral obligation give vaccines countries mostly managed contain it. expected indeed Moderna increase deliveries EU lot august. delivery commitments US beyond end July. (They delivered 300 million US) Great work controlling pandemic. don’t get uptake Pfizer/moderna slow. Might well get people immunized ASAP, irrespective current infection levels 70% total population take years way pace dropping. 70% adults would late Summer likely. unreasonable want proper FDA approval.

Do think there's possibility get proper approval point though? Billions people vaccine issues whatsoever. people side effects died (blood clots AZ vaccine mostly), positively tragic. perspective public health, remember NSAIDs (like Advil Motrin) estimated kill 16,000 people per year. looking aggregate data, fair say COVID vaccine considerably safer Advil. get point 4 seasonal endemic coronaviruses cause colds, hundred rhinoviruses.   One myriad conspiracy theories floating around Moderna vaccine placebo. guess started ""leaked"" company email ""employee"" says something effect, ""does vaccine anything all!??"".  Internet ran it, Moderna administering fruit juice.  Merkel exactly young. That's funny, people know get vaccine gen x range, 40-60. Every single person know millennials generation vaccinated. think partly comes know perhaps location US. hard fast rule means. point, people going recognize we're probably going vaccinate kids. don't, going continue huge pool virus circulating population. People say, ""So what? kids get sick."" great. I'm glad don't.

The problem is, seeing, virus likes mutate. going continue mutate long allowed circulate population. Maybe we'll get lucky mutates harmless common cold. Maybe get lucky mutates something like SARS-CoV1 MERS. Maybe stays less same.

Either way, pool virus carried kids unvaxxed adults going dealt somehow. that's correct states high vaccination rates, states low vaccination rates like Florida, Mississippi, Alabama: large pockets sickness occur. Florida, tourism drive exposure tourists spread virus back home states. Florida cusp losing emergency status. July 3rd last day it, officially lose benefits, help needy sick, special government aid pop-up vaccination sites, etc. 

By time specified above, ""72 detected cases"" Delta exploded approximately 1,179,648 (on low side, assuming person infects 2 people). real data shows person Delta capability spread 6 people. what's going happen, lots potential so, unless get majority people vaccinated. Yes, know. heard vaccines going well useful  couple hypothetical questions:
1. US high population anti-vaxxers mixed large number vaccinated people, increased risk vaccine resistant variants breeding?
2. Similarly vast majority vaccinations targeted people older 12, likelihood variants infect children higher rates could emerge?

I'm genuinely curious this. Hopefully give people new anxieties. don’t know telling people need vaccinate frightening getting vaccine. It’s pretty clear faster spreading variants people going get vaccinated going get infected. think public health officials trying scare sense remaining vaccine resisters.

It's patronizing probably work, think doing.

If someone motivated get vaccine now, variant going scare action. current vaccines developed weeks virus appeared

So many questions. enough world vaccinated presumably. common misconception “faster production” steps shortened skipped.

Basically, governments paid vaccine advance, allowing vaccine mass produced completing early trials.

Because financial interests vaccine makers protected way, production happened PARALLEL normal safety trials.

All timelines applied would normally apply vaccine, happened around time instead one another.

IT WAS:

Start phase 1 look factories

Start phase two mass produce

Start phase three set delivery.

INSTEAD OF:

Start phase 1

Start phase 2

Start phase 3

Secure financing mass production

Find factories

Set distribution channels

Marketing campaign

Take orders

Begin distribution Still fucking around haven’t yet found out. either die/become permanently disabled, see enough friends die/become permanently disabled get vaccinated. big question bad get them? [why immune, Yeah I'm sorry came wrong way like bragging something. reread comment felt like could taken way definitely wasn't. hope situation continues improve reason Russia manipulate rubes easily could also factor. substantial number hospitalised patients UK vaccinated. age hospitalised patients still skews older.

Then skin turned blue. Nice That's true. brother want vaccine. However, entire family fully vaccinated Phizer. Covid, one Phizer vaccine put hospital three days. So, example get him. getting second vaccination cardiologist recommended get it. He's coming visit Florida birthday next month. know variant already Florida. live popular tourist beach city. plenty people here. he's going back small town Louisiana affected much Covid. already nervous wreck it. convincing get vaccine. see could disaster making.

 Please, get mad me. thought going make Covid vaccine. brother lost daughter, niece, car accident pandemic. needs vaccation mental well being. He's really happy it. seen happy long time. Luckily, plenty outdoor dining choices activities. So, avoid indoors. parenting failures record, data shows 1 dose Pfizer 94% effective preventing hospitalizations.

It feels like left press release encourage people get 2nd doses, seems unnecessary caution (the burying efficacy 1st dose, concept getting 2nd doses clear).

Absolutely true everyone get 2nd dose available countries taking 1st dose strategy, still unquestionably good strategy even rising case numbers significant concern anywhere 1st dose vaccinations high, especially vulnerable populations. That's call reddit circlejerk. People upvote want believe, whether that's positive negative. believe many people even kids fearmongering they're worried themselves, kids. Studies still showing kids low risk want admit that.

The U.S. almost all-time low daily Covid cases blows mind anytime anyone says otherwise. easy check that. Maybe targeted non-corporate landlord's payoff forced rest waive back rent without credit. make 5 days £100 extra issue deaths, least vast majority them, are/were entirely preventable, especially vaccines widely available. question is: unvaccinated scared covid, would even go convention first place?

So leaves people vaccinated people unvaccinated give shit Ofcourse media making seem much worse lately, they're grasping getting clicks soon it'll end vaccines.

Having said that, story factually true variants. Brazil/SA definitely kind vaccine escape, spread less. UK/Indian got increasingly better spreading.  imagine rules stay place least ages eligible vaccine. Since vaccination rate may get high enough, may one us foreseeable future. time enough people least protection either vaccination exposure. limit number people get seriously ill die, like seasonal flu among us.

Ideally wearing masks working home otherwise distancing possible ill (and certainly need cough regularly) become norm, seems important factor limiting spread. announce?.. said maybe August Maybe count it: latest mRNA vaccine, whose name slipped mind, rather poor results. Honestly, based history, seems backlash going happen matter here. Delta variant one fungal eye infections commonly accompanying severe it’s prompting doctors remove patient’s eyes? vaccination successful variant think exciting news. Well comparing population hundreds millions small amount compared many well quickly find stats specific scenario, keep mind difference percentage raw numbers. Pfizer 95% effective infection (unclear right means detectable infection symptoms. money's detectability, digging trials would answer question). Moderna 94, AZ 79, JnJ 66. looking way smaller number people ever get infected begin with. 

Assuming stat correct, 10% overall hospitalizations still represents much larger number would, say, 10% vaxed admissions vaxed people even get infected begin with. Put another way, 10% 1,000 infections bigger 10% 10 vaxed infections.

Most people hit hospital vaccination infected vax shortly body could develop immunity (within 2 week post-vax time period). 

I found article MedPageToday Cleveland Clinic. 4300 hospital admissions Jan April year, 99% fully vaxed. line hospitals reporting.

You're safer getting vax.

Unfortunately virus doesnt really care feel it.  It’s hard say. 6 cases 5 hospitalized two died? Makes think weren’t testing enough unless super deadly new strain….  johnson vaccine? I’m anxious. I’m originally states stuck last year due covid flight cancellations. Unlucky timing. lost people covid really scares honest.

I'm going comic convention September require masks, I'm wearing mask, I'M GOING CON YAY! I'm fully vaccinated willing part, period.

And, fuck con crud whole.   realize done rollout yet UK. Still dude, I've desperate updated Janssen info new variants anywhere basically latest found variants India shit starting get ugly there. threat hospitalizations/death incredibly low good spot. remember Covid becoming endemic mild illness clear goal

That's really accurate. goal get rid it, solidify seasonal virus. virus mutates incredibly quickly. Keeping low infection numbers important preventing out-mutating efficacy vaccines.

Frankly trying eradicate together. Except kids can't vaccinated yet, immunocompromised [who alone number millions country alone], mutations pockets Covid create continue infect everyone (even reduced rate). lakh english word either. lakh english word...it's hindi believe. continue saying laksha already indian word. landlords would ones suffering huge financial losses. tenants already broke. That's mean, addition protection symptomatic Covid. Almost reduction hospitalization comes getting Covid begin with. 

If vaccinated get Delta variant, around 40% less likely hospitalized early data have. They'll doom themselves. rest us fine. anyone know many vaccines they're currently giving weekly? Lots viruses cause long term symptoms, new thing. COVID huge risk younger people.

What mean hurt anyone else? still catch spread COVID vaccinated... Wonder I'm gonna one dose Pfizer one Moderna, maybe I'm immune 🤔 word whether Moderna effective Delta variant? 

My father got Moderna, I’m worried he’s soon gonna tell “stay home much possible” Delta variant. two sides really. factual reporting headline completely misinterpreted without properly reading article. also mostly emphasis negative news, gets also blown bit proportion, good news rarely gets reported stowed away end article.

I think people kind fed now. Like see headline saying, 'Delta coming infectious variant far' like oh go again. look question matters, 'are vaccines effective it' find vaccines work completely fine it. many people, included, done way reporting done. see people call fearmongering, way is, even though factually correct.

It’s fine take reasonable precautions also need let kids kids, see friends, attend person school, etc. lot damage overreacting covid would have. talking about?

That Pfizer mounted campaign discredit AZ vaccine? would say AZ hard data that.  biologist's worst fears drug-resistant bacteria mutating viruses. long time coming.

The scary thing decent proportion people vaccinated, *enough* people, vaccinated people become infected also transmit virus, selecting infectious variants. Errors reproduction, recombination, cause higher lower virulence (severity symptoms), higher lower rate transmission, including possible accumulation genetic tools.

During flu season, greater concern, exchange genetic material.

Currently *not supported* Covid 19 insert human DNA, genetics clear cut one might think. 
Theoretically *possible*, based mechanisms genetic replication, DNA synthesized segment viral RNA, DNA mistakenly inserted human DNA. *improbable*, hosts, opportunities 1/100 million chance event occur. mean insertion would necessarily anything, depending size segment inserts.
If Covid 19 ever got ahold coding enzyme ""intentionally"" insert genome, someone concurrently infected virus contains mechanism recombination occur, would huge trouble. Also *not likely*, *possible*. Yeah know contributing I’d wasn’t actually aware going moderna showed figured going Pfizer 31 counties Missouri currently 20 new cases per 100,000 people per day (based 7 day case average). those, none third population fully vaccinated less 25%. US average currently 45%. September they're applying EUA. committees split whether enough emergency age group. Case counts, variants, many sick children summer influence approval process. deliveries June moved deliveries Q4 tho.

So expected.  Landlords would collected money anyway. tenants would able pay, benefits them, landlord; tenants would evicted, benefits tenant landlord.

I think ideal move would state pay around 90% force landlords waive rest (in return reducing vacancy rate). Yeah doesn’t fit scaremongering rhetoric.  Nope. didn’t act like that. specifically addressed it.  vaccine help why? people country covid even already vaccinated 2 times good Pfizer/BioNTech. think strange lot facilities approved EMA lately make vaccine, however deliveries actually decrease 30-40% July, meaning increase export. 

Of course whole planet needs vaccine - think it’s strange EU least manage negotiate delivery speed June level least initial 600M order completely delivered.

Ontario handled situation, lockdown, like absolute shit.

PS: upvoted - idea think I'd downvote you. clarify, DeSantis anti-vaccine comment might lead one believe. Earlier year toured state stood front big podium read ""seniors first"" encouraged get vaccine. even held press event vaccinated 100-year-old live TV. 

Trump minion not, DeSantis promoting vaccines.  Well, I'm guessing Trump created belief COVID serious (if hoax) people. belief, bother vaccine? hassle. Would waste weekend, take two days work, recovering vaccine side effects deal common cold?

On top that, lot people, especially lower levels education, understand scientific process all. see vaccine pushed record time get skeptical it, understand (or care understand) different testing phases go FDA approval.

So, people, unnecessary hassle (side effects) essentially common cold, might dangerous rushed through. like people taking every cue Trump -- people still make decisions based info have, Trump vaccinated one piece information.

The issue Trump gave really bad information downplaying dangers COVID, makes risk/reward vaccine ""meh"" lot people (when objectively best thing health).  Sinovac &amp; Sinopharm? case. chances extremely low data prove that. Wear mask makes feel better, practically going do: make feel better  Darwin agrees you.    Ya basically, Canada likely reach 85% higher coverage. We’re lucky low level hesitancy. Something gong-show time successful.

The messaging inconsistent around AZ. messaging changed around mRNA ""preferred"". NACI alignment Health Canada. indicative gong-show.

I agree we're amazing tbh think gong-show completely expected. Every nation world going grievances around government actions course pandemic. *requires significant medical attention 4% time, perpetuates transmission, enables vectors mutation.

Peer pressure vaccination prevails here. best, setting clandestine vaccinations neighbor church friends can’t see get shots might help. a, “You drink one Baptist can’t drink two” sort thing… careful build mistrust vaccine (because it’s highly protective spreading covid) cloth masks effective. 

It may also give impression aren’t vaccinated, like skipping mask (I always wearing cloth mask doesn’t much anyway) [28.6% deaths Delta variant COVID-19 UK occurred fully vaccinated That's false. vaccine, like others, reduces likelihood contracting illness question. That's point vaccine.  well known US little testing limitations. CDC community seroprevalence surveys across country found X4 X10 infections vs known positive tests.

Several reasons biggest people got symptoms minor symptoms reason seek testing -- never got counted. fudge factor thought X3, official 34M count really likely 100M...nearly 1/3 population.

I simply pointing data yet another point proof 1st dose important. concern Delta, majority vaccinated population, variant *also* real concern.

If people want concerned getting virus requires medical attention, that's prerogative.  I’m OP, see Cook county data 73.5% 1 dose group 57.3% fully vaxxed. everyone department exposed. exposed individuals, everyone got except one vaccinated rest got vaccinated. 

It would suspicion people may exposed identified close contacts. Cuba fine. going worst times since ""Special Period"". Looking info too, thanks asking. country Pfizer behind schedule?

In Germany, delivered almost perfectly, far tell. Like two million doses delayed two weeks, three weeks ago week's delivery well next week's increased compensate that. One two correct. Unless someone looking log data you’re looking linear. sense community all? ww2 happened today, peolple would selfish. sad. Anyone know many vaccines applied India today? Hopefully broke yesterday's record. No, correct. endemic we’ll never spared completely deaths, approaching levels it’s tolerable risk - quite car accident levels 104 day, close alcohol (291 per day). That’s basically band mind (alcohol choice; driving breathing air not, though getting vaccinated choice). want closer car deaths alcohol, we’re entering band. caveat saw sizable drop last summer cases deaths, need concerned exit summer months (Or, arguably south, summer months drive people indoors). flu model, need summer months significantly lower accommodate rises winter. We’re getting close, point risk acceptable. fair, vaccinated employee 23 much higher probability surviving COVID even vaccinated. good help prevent spread though. 58 year old died gotten vaccine greatly increase odds survival. victim 53. Seniors heading toward age absolutely get vaccinated. create pool hosts wherein Covid mutates. far variants kept check vaccine (mostly) lose resolve vaccinate all, risk breakthrough strain could restart whole pandemic potentially greater destruction. much emphasis danger seniors. younger people died analyzed obesity comorbidities. Young people feel safe. Brazil locked down. That’s bad Brazil.  get vaccinated enjoy delta variant difference preventing hospitalizations preventing COVID. 

Two doses Pfizer prevents 90-94% COVID cases, means hospitalization rate significantly lower.

96% prevention hospitalization means doses less effective preventing COVID delta variant. One dose could even less effective. means people still getting COVID delta going hospital, potentially spreading it.

The second dose necessary caution. Yes, unfortunately people continue live like past year half. can’t help feel you’re making mountain molehill. You’re right Laksha original, calm lol Let’s throw universal influenza vaccine list we’re it. Keep kids school side effects worse younger people older people though - myocarditis issue studied basically exclusively effected men 30, 18. is, however, discussion-worthy ""symtomatic disease"" entails. everyone gets mild fever day nothing else dose 1, disappears dose 2, really matter much. two seem related, don’t think?

Looked linked article, found 94% 1 dose pfizer 71% 1 dose AZ hospitalization. I'd skeptical 94%, confidence interval 46%-99%. one dose seem offer pretty strong protection severe illness second dose sure provides strong protection. And, notably, effectiveness 1 dose pfizer symptomatic disease 36%. need second dose, 88% symptomatic disease. even read every post made? says post 5 full vaccinated deaths focused older folks waning immune systems immune compromised receive full benefit vaccinations stop fear mongering fully vaccinated significant protection submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm you. blame Russia. 

Anyone country spread whatever information want. 

The problem US people *keep falling stuff*. 

Bad stuff everywhere. Criminals going away, protect locking doors. Disease going away, get vaccines. like email **phishing** attacks, misinformation going away, learn recognize real. 

I answers, obviously sort lack ""right kind"" proper education. actual scientific evidence think r/COVID19 much better sub far Canada done 

Germany also it, actually Merkel AZ first dose got Moderna second dose today

In Chile decided give Pfizer second dose people got AZ first dose (after one case thrombosis suspended AZ anyone younger 45 50 around that, suspended women) good thing Covid communicable disease ever existed ever exist.  Absolutely, certainly means keep current pace 35M+ doses administered per day. write pcr report  Well sadly passed away years ago. That’s actually perfect example bad reason understanding risk. That's calculated. compare chance hospitalization without vaccine. factor two effectiveness.     kind encouraging way, could mean there's enough Corona news report God damn it, I’m tired hometown continuously popping shit like this. Sweden resisted covid regulations while. US Congressman even referred 'Swedish Model'. looks like bit butt highest deaths per population Nordic countries. Lol, nothing. Thank unvaccinated neighbors Jeez dude, either story made up, immune system speak living bubble, need stop tongue kissing every coughing homeless guy run Ok and? live Norway barely infections comparison US I've made habit wearing mask crowded places regularly using antibac. mind, makes feel safe protected out. want catch common cold either think brilliant wearing mask socially acceptable now. That's wrong. sure understand question believe implications study fully vaccinated (ie. doses) good idea limit risk serious illness delta variant running rampant unvaccinated partly vaccinated age groups. need get majority fully vaccinated.   one masking social distancing either. think went away!! son caught covid November school. know anything messed with. guy pal, guy! India whose whole family recovered delta variant.All us first shot.I cann say 100% AZ (Covisheild) efficient averting death/hospitalisation putting end pandemic. AZ mRNA almost guarantee deaths (albeit less chance getting infected mRNA based). Would Moderna/Pfizer vaccinated immune system attack spike? latter, probably. gonna become fifth human coronavirus added list 200 Common Cold viruses.   soon plant went mask required vaccinated weren’t going ask you’ve vaccinated, amount mask usage dropped instantly. 1000 people site handfuls people wearing masks. South Carolina. going get ugly."
