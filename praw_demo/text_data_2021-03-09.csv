It's unfortunate voted much make good points. I'm providing alternative perspective perhaps explaining feels compelled make statements does, resounds strongly many people. I'm guessing many got real thing probably already know. Matter, yes. big risks? vaccines prevent serious disease cases. whole lockdown flatten curve push prevent hospitalizations deaths. faster gets there, less likely us get anyways. America ruled, largely, consent minority. simple majority get things done, much, nothing big. requires supermajority overcome filibuster anything substantial without consent minority parties. didn‚Äôt warm weather change anything last year?

put ur mouse bubble 9th march... Aren‚Äôt special get one each? Yea sucks around people taking seriously part. No, that's reality. bothered it? Again, options. one asking wear mask. think lot ppl looking current #s compared things went lockdown year ago seeing things still high, comparatively. 

I.e., numbers bad shut they're X times now, still opening things up.

Personally I'm saying im least glad seems like messaging CDC improving. think ""grandparents guidance"" clear practical stuff ppl could've used beginning.

Stay well everyone! No, that‚Äôs meant. think many people see possible. meant site wasn‚Äôt sure title. Sorry. 

This story get publicized. We've around 20k covid deaths far Netherlands, lot deaths reported last year. 0.5% mortality rate would put us 4 million cases far. Plus 1.2 million vaccinations puts us 5.2 million 30% less protected right now, lot among vulnerable. Absolutely do, something better nothing. I‚Äôm never fan last minute surprises guess. people going choose wear mask around others sick COVID, flu season.

Is described going on? public placed put above. less dystopian illegal people restaurants crowded events. Gyms completely closed almost year, hotels too. months last year illegal 1km away house.

So phases lift restrictions. part it.

Infections getting lower lower week get low enough everything completely open.  weird single maskless people disease vectors. humans disease vectors, mask not.

In laboratory settings, however, [immunity looks less toward Imo, makes J&amp;J's vaccine much important, phase 3 trial included South African variant. I'm glad relate, seems like many people thread properly comprehending us family members *out there* there. idea chain called Thrifty White might even thing.

I guess it‚Äôs historic name long standing something?

Cuz possible implications kinda sus. Oh idea this. got first dose AstraZeneca week ago take methotrexate kind relief. I‚Äôm inpatient nurse. still don‚Äôt enough PPE. Biden year alone ends pandemic, gets life back normal, back economic boom 2019 on(all things he's projected do) Dems win 2022 2024. state California withholding 40% vaccines we're wrong zip code. ability give 4x vaccines currently defeat Russia

how exactly considered defeat? sub literally plagued bots north korean levels propaganda I‚Äôm sorry, sounds awful. improved all? smell? taste? ""Wtf"" appropriate reply doubting existence long covid dumb doubting existence covid. Unless one those?

Is CDC, Mayo Clinic, US Government holding conferences it, Fauci saying ""This phenomenon really quite real quite extensive"" good enough dude? 
CDC: 
Mayo Clinic: 
US Govt holding meetins, Fauci quote: Maybe, know lot people got it. also know people possibly get it. kid cannot vaccinated public government saying must subject medical procedure (a covid test) 2-3 times week. find dystopian.

Again...everyone 16 eligible vaccinated now. point two tiers society? never understand need respond ""I like this"" ""well, do!""

Like, okay? Good you. Clearly, post you.  could also reach herd immunity bunch people continue catching virus. We're already something like one third Americans virus, contributes herd immunity well. *Cries Mexico* Hopefully J&amp;J vaccine make option possible sooner. wasn‚Äôt likely happen Pfizer Moderna ones -20C needs. Yes, free vaccines. US taxpayers paid vaccinate people internationally.

Just like Europe, large scale shipments started internationally. people making distributing vaccines vaccinated yet. live state generous vaccine distribution even hit 25 percent vaccination.

When US supply give, it'll sooner Europe spare extra production ramp billions units. hell think county 350 million people going units produced billions? 

A countries made grand gestures shipments million tens millions doses. That's small drop bucket compared billions people done political move. Critiquing media isn‚Äôt making enemy sure could pose question, hopefully people offer insight. I'm 22M living parents Illinois, parents working home since start pandemic. learned today Dad going work tomorrow following day work holding important meeting company leadership team 20 people. says everyone get tested past weekend got negative covid test. claims social distancing everyone wearing masks... break lunch dinner eating 6 feet apart socialize. I'm pissed careful entire time. never seen friends indoors vigilant mask wearing (i currently wearing n95 surgical whenever go store). 

From dad told me, meeting need person. He's able job easily home hundreds successful meetings via Microsoft Teams. 

AITA getting pissed saying yes meeting? legal implications company would liable got covid subsequently spread mom? 

Side note, know companies this? find fact meeting happening completely irresponsible unnecessary mine week ago felt little feverish sniffles overall fine.

The bad thing I'm clumsy af kept banging arm wall. need enemy dig at, ya? really see Con scene fully coming back next year, unfortunately 2022 events cancelled? Basically one cares mandates. gonna wear mask, did.

I feel like underestimating many people wearing they're told to.

If workplace mandating it, wear one. grocery story mandating it, wear one. country mandated times public places regardless social distancing, ~~I go outside~~ would wear one. friend Italy first started hitting people collecting food. brother told stock up, thought dumb. grocery stores ran out. told us heed warning experience go stock up. would guess late February.  shut schools swine flu, brain infection flu lot rarer covid. people taken back this.

Because bad state must bad. It‚Äôs funny see people don‚Äôt mask disease vectors.

So hate one inform non-respiratory diseases spread person person masks fuck-all prevent. change regime ramping response, something US good at. Can‚Äôt wait entire world get vaccinated. Probably half state won‚Äôt get vaccine get prioritize, benefit someone gets vaccinated, matter is.

I really doubt issue. means, expand eligibility, strongly suspect problem distribution centers volunteers give shots maxed out, think? Well, already mask little unnecessary point.

I know people say, ""We know get again!"" I'm assuming immune system still works way always has.  thank god Donald Trump Operation Warp Speed Yeah understand extra money help lower income families individuals struggling throughout pandemic. people debate whether additional 1,400 needed, never experienced economic hardship kind, ignorant. Yes debate whether needed, something needed help americans. Interestingly, medical professionals (you know, people study career) almost favor mask mandates. Crazy, right? Tests shown Moderna Pfizer's vaccines highly effective variants, no, likely true. Guess travelling anywhere then. gonna using vaccine passport, way concerned privacy skip long term testing though unfortunately legally can‚Äôt enforce penalties wearing masks. DeSantis signed executive order last year banning local municipalities enforcement  big pharma science denier?

 honestly matter think think. NACI thinks right move I'll believe UtopiaCrusader find someone else aligns goals. people going choose wear mask around others sick COVID, flu season. personal choice. also choice find another therapist. could virtual appointments. 1) lot people died already
2) lot people caught covid already
3) good amount people getting vaccinated Woo got J&amp;J! scheduled May, SWIK called extra vaccines school clinic. words, count J&amp;J vaccine later year. better know efficacy especially Variants, critical success fall. think states need expand eligibility. 

More us vs nonsense. I'd shocked things limited anything number distribution centers volunteers give shots right now. Dime dog night going lit. mean ""if _would_ caught COVID, there's 65% chance vaccine stop it.""

So given 10 situations would caught moderate case COVID, Pfizer Moderna vaccines would stop least 9 them, J+J vaccine would stop 6 7.

That's still meaningful difference. That‚Äôs constitution folks. Protecting us mask mandates I‚Äôm also Texas. don‚Äôt agree dropping mask mandate, doubt much truly change. 80% COVID deaths 65+. additional 10-20% obese autoimmune compromised patients.

I consider statistics qualifying ""extremly deadly"". 

I understand &amp; COVID problem contagious is, hidden is, deadly 75 million people US, 3% deathrate, me, considerable extremly deadly.

Hope stay safe. everybody murderer, claim Greg Abbott murder quite meaningless. want significance attached accusation murder, logic dictates vast majority people murderers merely allow others things may lead deaths.

Your definition murderer entirely removes significance claim. fuck care say Greg Abbott murder think Habib works local convenience store sells cigarettes also murder? accusation utterly without meaning apply broadly.

And bring ""some early 1900's Russian politician"" highlight utterly gullible use COVID statistics. wholly believe cite Chinese COVID statistics (which chance close accurate) fits narrative America bad. call useful idiot. use obviously fake statistics prove point. authoritarian regime give fuck civil liberties, human rights freedom press like Ji Xinpeng's, America could boast falsely low COVID numbers China.

It's matter right wrong. I'm arguing position, namely state governments primarily rule top-down dictates allow people municipalities decide want lives. support national mask mandate, support state-wide mask mandates either. think people free choose course life.

Personally, wear mask, cover mouth cough. small courtesy polite others. I'm going tell someone either recovered COVID vaccinated must wear mask, despite chance spreading disease. going demand government use threat force inherent government make people bend will. I'm authoritarian asshole wants dictate people can't lives.

Let ask one question. parents COVID last November fully recovered. They've also, recommendation doctor, gotten vaccination. still forced wear masks public? Considering there's zero chance can' transmit COVID anymore, rationale forcing wear mask? can't even call murderers chance could harm someone. What's rationale demanding mask up? Four million doses total made available purchase Member States, pro-rata population. doses delivered end March. doses come top schedule deliveries currently agreed Member States BioNTech-Pfizer.

Seems like need purchased individual countries great news nonetheless considering issues Moderna (mainly) AZ need eat them. Remind me, many people died Sturgis last year?  UK much better 1 3 Oh, shit. Even fruit flies last long kitchen. US conducted 1,119,032 tests per 1 million people. Brazil conducted 133,897 tests per million people.

I'm 56 get double yearly flu jab hopes works Hep-B impossible. I've every possible vaccine one, response. UK domestic vaccine production months ago, currently producing around 2-3million doses week, Astrazenica vaccine only. Unlike EU, whose members already sizeable vaccine industry place, simply vaccines export, yet.

There also new plants UK geared start supplying Novovax Valneva vaccine candidates when/if approved use. problem. Good luck! Nobody knows. done lab tests. Oh, huh small world! think dumb Texas governor. 

Ann Richards way high IQ one. Kinda blows mind Brazil seeing record number death infection still fraction worst things got America. Hell daily new infections deaths things plummeted still similar Brazil worst currently, they've got 2/3rd population America does. I'm guessing able test accurately identify deaths nearly well can? pfizer's effective problematic variants? see another comment made (about adult friendships) we‚Äôre local other. One thing partner try volunteering vaccine place (the one EAMC running across mall Tuesday Morning building). Last heard, volunteers eligible vaccinations. I‚Äôve heard Naples tend pretty mask, Tampa, Orlando, Jax, suburbs mask mandates place extent. Tallahassee Gainesville. sure panhandle west tally though. 

I‚Äôve driven around state, since June I‚Äôd say wear mask inside 95% time. country doesn‚Äôt require it, store requires (Publix, Walmart, Target requirement stores).  UK broken highly editorialised title? Clearly UK following different strategy splitting doses meeting 'fully' nicely thank you.

For interested non agenda based data, doses per 100 pop available site. surely 3 markets would even lucrative. Honestly, know companies apply all, most, countries simultaneously, surely man power oversee multiple application processes simultaneously. 

But expect deliveries schedules also it. long approved need supply doses yet. Yes theoretically anybody high risk major complications death would already vaccinated. whoever left (young people) still may get it; would virtually risk major complications death. 100% assault documented video. Zero chance defend herself. MUST prosecuted. still remember said LAST YEARS spring break would lead large outbreak.... There's enough yet MD. shows early. first 100M lines go UK. 

Indeed, now, result decision means doses go UK. said, everyone could set production lines UK (like currently happening EU), export ban place, export either AZ vax war accelerates previously established vax math add up;

Do actually look data? Seriously... plateau? There's 15 percent drop compare Sat/Sun/Mon vs Sat/Sun/Mon week ago. 

Why wait more? people want wait more... people like say wait even that.  Banning exports means someone wanted set production line UK exporting vaccines able export them.

As stands production line could set vaccines exported start.

The difference UK EU production lines set UK order specifying first 100M lines go UK. That's close export ban saying EU factories shipping 100% production EU, means there's partial export ban new cases 2021.

COVID killed around 500,000 people past year. Tobacco killed 480,000 people past year. terms mortality, they're pretty equivalent. condemnation virtually every single politician failing ban tobacco calling murderers failure? sure problem calling politicians lifting statewide restrictions responsible murdering anyone succumbs COVID. equally call politicians impose restrictions tobacco far question - definitely blame Biden implementing federal mask mandate. think that's pathetic leadership. 

So Joe Biden considering previous president telling people drink bleach stop virus, (or whatever fuck coming pathetic excuse man's mouth) - current senile old man president nothing improvement. 

This little whataboutism. like said, account 25% death toll virus 4% worlds' population.

I think trusting official statistics little much. really believe China 4,848 deaths COVID? again, bit authoritarian wants impose everyone around you, course trust Communist government imprisons dissidents contradict official narrative. believe official Chinese numbers, bigger fool sound. look world map. guess sheer coincidence nations freer press higher COVID numbers. Apparently freedom press causes COVID deaths. governments lying numbers rubes like swallow wholesale fits narrative America = bad. ""useful idiot"" Vladimir Lenin would call you. twist turn way want currently EU exporting hundreds millions vaccines, UK none. Paragraph 9 executive order


Local officials blocked making determinations states emergency ""to extent necessary ensure local officials impose restrictions response covid-19 disaster inconsistent executive order"" feel dumb asking this, someone explain difference administration distribution? They‚Äôre similar it‚Äôs throwing Idk national breakdowns, Ohio shows 11% people 30's vaccinated. Missouri looks similar. states outliers top vaccination list, middle/bottom. breakdowns show half people gotten shots.

So conservatively assume 5% US adults 30's received shots, let's guesstimate 5% ~30 million people (both true numbers probably bit higher) ~1.5 million people, probably handful suspicious deaths. think it‚Äôs gotten little better last weeks, agree. I‚Äôve updating friends vaccine progress, surprised hear we‚Äôre going hit 1/10 Americans fully vaccinated 1/5 partially vaccinated week. Folks impression vaccines don‚Äôt even work variants, isn‚Äôt true  Politicians trying appeal preferred voter groups keeping age high. We're almost point things first come first served Zen master little boy.... Essentially, yes. That's really means something like becomes ""endemic.""

It's also possible viruses currently think seasonal cold flu viruses started larger threats people's health (or I've read). I'd love see states mass vaccination centers like ones utilizing stadiums, convention centers, huge FEMA military sites offer sort 'open season' day like week. appointments. drive up. Let anyone show wants shot. requirements..... strawmanning me

No, clear enough, think. booster lowering efficacy compared letting single dose play makes perfect sense. That's Sputnik V opted use 2 different adenoviruses...to circumvent vector immunity. 

The booster shot increasing efficacy makes sense Sputnik V opted 2 different vectors. one strawmanning *me* üòÖüòÇ. said efficacy *dropping* result second dose *not* make sense said did, vaguely citing anti-vector immunity reason. agree 1 dose J&amp;J could well reach 80s given enough time reach peak antibody levels.

I never said üòÇüòÇ said imaginable second dose could push 80%. would make best single dose far.

As right now, definitely best, overall compared vaccines' one dose regimens. could well case booster modestly increases efficacy, increases duration substantial degree.

That's case. well established researched. second dose definitely gonna increase duration immunity. highly unlikely significant impact efficacy. safe assumption, assumption nonetheless. We'll see. amazing honest. wife (her daughter) got first shots states mother (because teacher) got there. dad late 60's, wife's grandparents (91 nonno, 85 nonna) got theirs. Hopefully get sped we're coming August. instead weeks really meant month half  Apologies, corrected. ‚ÄúJust two weeks‚Äù need know this. 

Also, Long Covid (long term affects) possibility even mild infection vaccine. Meanwhile NJ just* made available teachers. I‚Äôm holding much hope I‚Äôll get vaccine anytime soon. get vaccine $1 Haribo candy time!? Take dollars! That's I've hearing. Thanks! file direct deposit checks start going week 22nd. Paper checks arrive week after. know keep saying distribution high, everyone complaining eligibility, least state yesterday's update OHA
""Oregon administered cumulative total 1,179,510 first second doses COVID-19 vaccines. date, 1,418,455 doses vaccine delivered sites across Oregon.""
Which 83% doses used. states extremely high supply using? Got mine yesterday.. super easy far! Congrats!! Also daily vaccinations static, increasing. increasing average rate 30K vaccinations per day average nationally. ~30K per day average increase fairly consistent since beginning January. It‚Äôs consistent increase every day, trend consistent. trend holds vaccinating 3 million per day end March 4 million per day end April. knows hold, expect 2 million per day likely lower limit unless significant impact supply. may deadly relatively speaking (so far types low) ..but least something scary like sweating sickness killed within hours infection! No. second dose automatically scheduled first one given. BTW screw allergies... making cough itchy throat right really sucks scares me. I've first shot scheduled second Friday damn allergies making feel way. Got yesterday -- arm soreness feel little flushed today, that's it. think that‚Äôs quite reasonable position. Telling people keep living like even vaccinated think bridge far vast majority, starts get little unreasonable (even it‚Äôs technically yet). Plus 4 weeks, HUGE number people vaccinated US, meaning slashed transmission others, people you‚Äôre potentially transmitting also largely immune, least greatest risk you. expect stimulus checks arrive bank accounts? male 6 ft, that's crazy. I'm damned near 30 wear 34 pants. could stand lose 20 pounds I'm definitely obese Way go! 

 exciting see stories people vaccinated across world. slow area rocketed last week. It‚Äôs coming, hang bit longer! Got first Moderna shot, pain flush/euphoric complaining arthritis acid pains... can't complain, really! appreciate good delirium. Yes, there's average delay around 2-3 days jabbing jab reported, based day vaccine administered CDC dashboard. Well, parties panic new variant discovered... pandemic never ends. Obese people dying taking hospitals outs strain society. need educate intricacies society works whining much ot didn't, got shot :) limit limit uh hu don‚Äôt see Vermont Wyoming better; fewer people mean April 5 course Felt like got slugged arm hours, otherwise no. side effects ‚Äúyour mileage may vary‚Äù person person understand it, though I‚Äôm doctor.. tragic is, young people like describe die every day huge variety reasons aren‚Äôt immediately obvious. girlfriends cousin collapsed last year parking lot work. 27 years old, healthy, athlete, co-morbidities... spent 3 months hospital getting pacemaker put loads stuff procedures. gotten vaccine would look like that‚Äôs it... freak health thing still can‚Äôt identify root cause of. I‚Äôd also add moderna (not sure Pfizer) testing 3 separate things:

-if third shot half dose existing vaccine provides better protection SA variant

-if ‚Äúthird‚Äù booster targeting SA variant provides better protection already received existing two dose regimen.

-if booster used beginning two dose regimen someone yet vaccinated.

So it‚Äôs possible could see different things available depending process well. wouldnt say that, plenty older people survived covid without vaccine many didnt even know it. Ah, see. Death spectator sport. Cool. [/s] Also spring breaks.

College kids *going to* go spring break trips, that's are. Unless socially impaired like lol, that's reality situation. Preventing would involve truly massive police crackdown, magnitude neither manpower morale for. And, depending state, possibly even legal basis so. say brainless really mean unintelligent, admit way worded blew proportion bit. never intelligence, IQ education, well informed educated people different. really smart people make stupid decisions cost peoples lives time. may stupid, still stupid. could every degree world smartest person world, yet still drink drive accidentally kill someone's family, alcohol blame. person decided drive blame otherwise cops would put booze jail. smart still make stupid choices getting at. claim politico reliable source. false several media watchdog sites inform Yes! Super excited. many bands know still together! Looks good! clinical trial results impressive, technology Oxford-AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson. Well don‚Äôt crimes :) Thanks clarifying term, interpreted decentralized distribution instead expansion vaccine access regardless eligibility. interesting happen prison.  Careful. open-ended headline like leaves distinct impression nothing actually strategy. Twitter total garbage. deleted Twitter last year become unbelievably toxic mental health overall societal health. got flu shot Target last year. Quick, easy, free, got $5 gift card. places put shots arms, better. 100%. Put sucker full blast! wits end ""one year ago X happened"" posts. know seeing subs frequent wrestling sub getting lot since around time last year wrestling shows crowds stopped promotions tried figure stay running pandemic. ""remember world suck"" posts depressing usually cheap karma grabs. Sounds like feelings. feel don‚Äôt deserve value system. 

I‚Äôm sure line right get it. Surely smokers shouldn‚Äôt. people exercise daily? people eaten fried food? people consume alcohol?

By logic second paragraph makes sense obese people get vaccine first. they‚Äôre likely severe symptoms, it‚Äôll put greater strain society. get vaccine don‚Äôt need hospitalized, it‚Äôs less strain society. US keeps ramping up, get population, bet would lot extra vaccines would going Canada. They're one important trading partners, share huge border us. 500% less.

well, that's possible Think thousands wasted doses eligibility requirements. Sometimes logic logical tried going university campus last weekend reading outside (had get house focus), told either put mask leave campus. outdoors alone...no one except security guard.  Reason 0: Money. Thank you!   couple years ago got HFM kid brought home daycare. stuff growing hands, feet mouth (hahah seriously though sucked) wore latex gloves mask went doctor know hell know airborne not. People looked weird care wanted sure.  suppose interesting know percentage people COMPLETED vaccination per defined protocol?

This value judgement, interesting view data. y'all treating like arguing sports statistics favorite cricket teams. Well look U.K. U.K. strain 3 months later bigger mess before. Thank you! I'd say kicking someone store pretty effective enforcement. Well hit Day 7 6 minutes ago!  strawmanning me. never said 4 weeks enough general, I'm saying 4 weeks likely premature J&amp;J due vector resistance. booster lowering efficacy compared letting single dose play makes perfect sense. That's Sputnik V opted use 2 different adenoviruses...to circumvent vector immunity. 

Now, agree 1 dose J&amp;J could well reach 80s given enough time reach peak antibody levels. would make best single dose far. 80+% 90+% pretty close, would make J&amp;J single dose nearly effective w doses M-RNA vaccines. Now, something brought duration immunity. could well case booster modestly increases efficacy, increases duration substantial degree. goes fairly well, I‚Äôd assume mask requirements dropped vaccine made available everyone wants it? Big step! Furnace Fest? People age terribly fragile. husband's grandmother recently died age 93. developed UTI hospitalized. collapsed walking hospital room. injuries fall killed her. Sad managed avoid Covid died weakened common ailment. live near town TX story happened. really stirred anti-vaxxers, they're talking proof vaccines worthless, bother risking side effects going immune afterwards. Rational people trying point vaccines keeping nursing home residents ICU, they're working intended. heard nursing home employees vaccinated. problem. Lots people want vaccines, large drive vaccine hub town nursing home thousands vaccines week. many people, even medical personnel, refusing believe effective fear harmful. ""feeling"" logical, *yours* is? catch fight polar bear get injection site. Big deal. total population 3/4 million people. California could vaccinate 5 days. July 1 latest. Yes, certainly do. includes people hypertension, heart conditions, obesity. So, casts pretty wide net hopefully get folks appointments. Im sure understand.

You understand 1 month larger period time 1 week? Wow. Sensitive much? one view data posted... one cut it. mean ""agenda"" play. free post link site showing different view. know hate entertaining idea vaccine could kill young person, I‚Äôm gonna lie, story looks like vaccine messed up. 

She started feeling bad soon second jab. liver ultimately failed. doesn‚Äôt randomly happen young people.

I‚Äôm going watch story closely. Pfizer also delayed, worth. Awesome, thanks reply Good news‚Äîopening day fact weeks away it‚Äôs logical fair. Urban areas getting fair share. Alaska done it. right, people going trauma actually often make ill-advised decisions. make ""brainless"", human. thing, I. I'm arguing idea people stupid making poor decisions pandemic. Yes, people smart others, someone's intelligence necessarily choice, product environment they've grown information they've taken (minus mental disorders could also affect things). Combine poor education worldwide trauma bound get people make poor decisions. said practical feasible expect 100 percent adoption 100 percent mitigation procedures. doable entire population. think saw something 6 weeks testing announced 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôd expect kind info next month so. sure could realistically expect available distributed. Everything I‚Äôve read seems imply wouldn‚Äôt thing til late summer/fall, even all. I‚Äôm impression precautionary make sure if/when needed, though I‚Äôm fair I‚Äôm sure allure money Max protection result coming point end 2021. Oh yeah people one year ago said science doesn‚Äôt support masks work, fact, science already supported it. Uh, didn‚Äôt anything feelings thanks reply?

Just another case obese people putting strain society. kroger pharmacist said situation arises approach store customers people individually course announce loudspeaker. think time remedy that. Humanity overcome lot plagues disease this. Imagine Europe Black Death, seeing massive swaths population die, literally clue happening outside vague idea God mad. amount fear terror must charts.

But, time goes by, things seem calm, people move onward. arm fall gets little sore. know everyone treating differently flu shot. I‚Äôm one them! got second one yesterday! Feel kind shitty, overall much worth it. guess do. proud save humans risk. Even prople would willing share doses cut promised production half. anyone actually enforce this? Oklahoma allowing people Arkansas get vaccinated there, lie residency? 30 min Oklahoma border older family members don‚Äôt qualify yet Arkansas eager get vaccine. I'm seriously wondering another coronavirus sub tolerate hostile anti-mitigation people one clearly gotten taken group. 2 anti-mitigation subs enough. also looking extreme opposite people live ridiculous exaggerations anti-mitigation people pretend everyone disagrees believe say. fully vaccinated today happier. assume got offended. Check cdc stats Florida far leader new variants. shit hole full uneducated science deniers. thank input basement-dwelling troll well... fact title article makes think might matter. DeSantis already said 55-59 would open week 60-64, knew exact date ages moving 60+. context, that‚Äôs double population Michigan. agree. hard balance needs many personal desire ""over."" say care anything, need read carefully. said caring archaic. apply comment you, me. cards needed entire world digital, moving purely digital would cost prohibitive tax poor, impossible ultra poor without connectivity level rely digital world, still. social security card works digitally physical card, vaccinations same. likely we'll see continuation enforcement cards like rollout, it'll likely local level officials required isn't, local travel access local venues/services, federal level they'll likely integrate existing databases vaccination records, easy task, insurmountable foreign one, either. need vaccination records interstate federal level, likely need real ID it, anyway, like much harder add tick box database. Houston Dallas actually better lower income people Austin thanks lower cost living. quality, definitely bang buck.

If essentially infinite money cost living really matter you. matter? Woosh Seems like conflicting news around. expecting trash, scare article, actually pleasantly surprised takeaways end. Basically... protect vulnerable ensure hospitals appropriate resources deal potential surges. Sounds totally reasonable me. said nothing lockdowns anything really. went observing 0.25% fatality 0.41%. Top covid alarmist fearmongerer Eric Feigl-Ding wife fled Austria kids could go school person. posts tweets almost daily it‚Äôs dangerous open schools. vaccine yet (can't find appointments anywhere), get 2 doses pneumonia ago arm in. wish would preemptively taken otc pain meds ice ready. got dominant arm constant movement, second one made arm swell move parallel ground. So, ice otcs might save there! sure compression would help, may worth trying ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è anyone point reliable source talks potential protection levels one Pfizer shot? 

I got shot today, understand won‚Äôt (nearly) fully protected 1-2 weeks second shot, 4-5 weeks now, I‚Äôm wondering days even week today I‚Äôll level protection yet. know it‚Äôs bit unknown I‚Äôm looking info topic I‚Äôm finding generic articles lacking clear information. Indian Heath Services well country! According CDC, tracker, 21.2% people covers received least one dose. Many states high vaccination rates‚ÄîAlaska, Dakotas, Oklahoma, New Mexico‚Äîhave large Native American populations. possible Alaska receiving far doses per capita states ‚Äî roughly 60% WA state example. 

This true several states wider eligibility like OK (but all). receiving vaccines helps vaccinate population much faster. Chose, contractually obliged. Since AZ doesn‚Äôt anywhere close 10m doses handin UK skip shipping UK next 6 weeks help offset lack choosing honoring EU contract? Seems perfectly reaaonable given choice put it. Depends ask, party affiliation is. hype around Cuomo real, resentment side - remember talking heads late night referencing as, ""Cuomosexuals""? got embarrassing bit, secret cared Cuomo 2nd worst death rate US implemented nursing home policy, guarantee significant contributing factor.. know exactly relationship, Cuomo's admin hid figures. me, enough I'd want resignation, live NY hard time getting past that. kinda like asking effective water hose fire, asking pouring gasoline. Plus spikes cases take long time. winter spike saw result upward trend began September/October. Texas gonna see spike cases due lifting mandates, would smothered vaccinations could ever gain traction. CDC always going use cautious approach, using language like ""a little bit longer"" shows see writing wall.

We're sort grey zone, things looking better week, large majority country still unvaccinated access little longer. probably want Israel situation high risk population shot kids go ballistic tossing caution wind keeping case count high. seem like fun person bedwetters around love reaffirmation smarter everyone else societal acceptance cover ugly mugs  1. Fuck, wanted vaccine :/
2. Well, example :) believe active duty/reserve/veterans family DoD ID. Yep. Looking forward that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 4 million shots go regions high percentage covid cases. could say regions foolish. got 100.000 extra doses Austria Tyrolia, people decided travel South Africa brought harmful strain them. region cases get 100k that's enough them. 4 mill highest risk regions might good idea issues here. First, it‚Äôs preprint, take findings conclusions grain salt. Second, it‚Äôs based results internet survey. sent survey ~120,000 people, ~6,000 declared they‚Äôd COVID. see, diagnosis independently verified. 

From studies I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôd agree long Covid effect people, doesn‚Äôt seem particularly prevalent. Except removal restrictions went effect today. cases went still restrictions. referring geographical area. It‚Äôs big city obviously. I‚Äôve lived half life. It‚Äôs smaller size compared major cities Texas, still one. Yeah, also last pandemic scale (Spanish Flu) many deaths caused secondary infection Stay home cook food Yeah sure ""they're supposed to"" ""autonomous"". 

But overall population health perspective would important vaccinate entire population treat two distinct ones.  Indiana, dropped 65 60 55 50! within 3 weeks mean...yes? interaction brief there‚Äôs problem it. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre full conversation close open window. /r/conservative? going really interesting see social media discourse Alaska's eventual reopening they've opened vaccine everyone 16. might one greatest things I've pleasure read internet. 

Thank stranger. Guh can't disagree premise, opportunity US January 2020. cat bag 99% world year now, New Zealand notable rare exception, situation benefited geographical location hard beat regards controlling virus transmission. 

I also personally consider chance society completely halted week time every couple months ""basically back normal"". Heck, business usual + masks would normal that. Thoughts people posting shots/cards social media? know lot people fomo think may good idea help promote vaccine people personal lives may hesitant Well idea getting vaccinated could touch passport soon possible... Many friends planning trip Mexico Carribean soon they're vaccinated.  real. Israel also donated small number doses PA probably Israel fully vaxxed.

People act like Israel could waltz Gaza start giving vaccines. That‚Äôs happens state 6 people leaving it. Simply put shouldn‚Äôt scary people make sound. common sense things continue woods realistically don‚Äôt expect immunity short term we‚Äôre back circle zero next winter. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* what? statement contradicts itself.

it would require invasive, depth, costly research prove anything since stopped tracking individual cases contacts.

to assert *this within realm possibility, according research* confirm anything, narrative. outcome actually confirmed.

it seems almost like youre implying dont tools information confirm effects, say nothing happened, move on

what factual evidence study confirm (that counties largest number sturgis attendees much higher infections following rally sturgis attendees) still rather significant. may confirm people counties got rally, rather someone willing attend event like sturgis likely fail adhere prevention guidelines. timing would allude former, both. 

regardless, weeks fall, dakotas rated worst world covid infections mortality. alone rather telling. (because it‚Äôs me) Dunno, you‚Äôd probably show utility bank statement local address. statement local shelter receiving services don‚Äôt residence. (Easy enough fake). 

With DoD ID think active duty reserves eligible? Dunno contractors tho part government? think news stations getting desperate two golden children, Trump Covid, going away lol I'm keeping mine un-laminated tell Isabella Rossellini final version. Theres nothing antisemitic anti zionist.

From covid perspective concern peoples interact vaccinated others not. 

A criticism health policy antisemitic. Like public education? think good idea someone put face right window breathe car? employee also walking back inside people eating, taking orders etc. None falls within safety guidelines. know that. Reckon I'll move back parents England bit. actually can't hack this.

That‚Äôs lie lmao quit spreading BS come vaccination center federal ID (passport, DoD ID, Id's direction) get vaccine? Biden promised case Americans May. holding administration promise. Better days coming again. felt like celebrating getting first dose vaccine. appreciate many things lot year. side sleeper, think side sleep on. first time non-dominant arm (right) second dominant (left) realized sleep right side more. Well Florida seems increments 5 years vaccine distribution, reduce 60-64 monday probably 55-59 late April problem Pfizer scaling process requires eye wateringly expensive hardware, specialist made short supply. hard limit fast grow facilities. 

A big chunk scaling near future improving efficiency current production lines, used take around 100 days go nothing phial, Pfizer process trying half time means would double production... get enough suppliers complex ingredients require. 

All scaling issues, that's best option make variety different types vaccines whatever existing facilities available, retool get even vaccines work. fully vaccinated (i.e. completed shot regimen, enough time elapsed max protection), would still actively avoid contact individuals confirmed COVID-19 still 10 day isolation period? Likewise would also actively avoid contact individuals living still 14 quarantine period? understand daily number cases deaths still relatively high. Lemme give shot, baby. I'll rearrange DNA üòõüçÜüí¶ decided move goalposts ""keep hospitals overwhelmed"" ""reduce COVID cases there's never chance hospitals overwhelmed even R-value spontaneously quarduples"" guaranteed end vaccination rollout.

Yeah, people forget goal entire time 'flatten curve', meaning overrun hospitals. see risk overrunning hospitals Texas (or states) matter even removing restrictions. people likely die hospitalized getting vaccinated high numbers cases going down.

Yes COVID still around, really feels like flattened curve can't really see changing out. Active duty military here.

I received dose yesterday.

A lot folks teleworking implementing similar measures civilian sector. work desk day, easy socially distance wear mask like people.

Folks like lucky get vaccine able keep mission going still maintaining health measures.

I think would make sense talking folks deployed set deploy, particularly navy.

Just we're military, mean priority people significantly likely die covid-19. Illinois expanded surprise. open obesity smoking huge group. pretty close everyone 16 I'm tired winning! Ooh scaryyyyy 64 years old California, living someone COULD get it, no..because Bill Gates. Smh.

wait. what? Cool understanding transmission thing correct interpreting as, ""if happen 5% people still get covid getting doses vaccine, less 10% chance transmit virus another person""? Yes export ban AstraZeneca chooses deliver UK orders first. 

The UK influence decision contract. example AZ shipped 10 million doses EU tomorrow would get absolutely problems. brother nurse got monday said felt nothing it. side effects shitting vaccines low-pop rural counties. It‚Äôs ‚Äî Alaska receiving 50% vaccines state. didn‚Äôt wear mask...for curbside pickup?!

Yes, Europeans pay instead prolonged epidemic, many deaths, longer shutdowns within days expensive vaccine. terrible failure EU commission.

here ya That's great, thanks looking up. think making mistake people got really angry regarding claim I've made.

Do show right away, show months?

Am misunderstanding trying show? remember Australia-thread, though. Comments locked within 3 hours, lol. Well one, permanent state. certainly empathize appreciate sentiment, know trying time many (including myself). Sadly, peoples selfishness led exacerbating pandemic orders magnitude, caused many, many unnecessary deaths. prove residence taking road trip Alaska? well technically isn't, buy local supply using commercial contracts works like export ban. saying good bad, it. freemarkert gonna freemarket. remember told us chill two weeks year ago.

Cases plummeting extremely effective vaccines. 60% 65+ population vaccinated (Or slightly 50%, can't remember) month away. 

Hospitals risk overwhelmed. time move assess risk. US discovering tracking proportion cases caused new variants, gained prevalence rapidly here. roughly time J&amp;J study results announced, prevalence estimated 1-4% US depending location. 

We've got decreased population density compared UK, heavily restricted international travel, also never full reopening 2020 scale UK's ""eat help out"" scheme (which likely played large part seeding new variants there).

The variants definitely spread - meaningfully yet. lots expectations fourth wave able deploy vaccines rapidly enough, there's much urgency. last weeks they've gone 1-4% 10% cases, that's expected increase rapidly going forward...

Source:  Secretly selling highest bidder personal profit, certain administrations may tried still charge. thats worst part, months getting majority folks vaccinated hear wingnuts still long. would infuriating numb stupidity nowadays. I'd take American baffling watching everyone go from, ""it's flu, blown proportion"" ""why taking LONG get vaccine?! person got high blood pressure. high blood pressure asthma bad knee!! roll horrible!!!""

State local governments significant control distribution though, pandemic proven anything inept many state local governments handling public health emergencies. lol fuck fake ass science amirite? Seriously. state saying 16-40 group anticipate getting vaccinated late summer earliest winter latest weeks ago. going fast! wrong, 92.6% effective 2 weeks first dose second used documents submitted Food Drug Administration2 derive vaccine efficacy beginning 2 weeks first dose second dose (Table 1). Even second dose, BNT162b2 highly efficacious, vaccine efficacy 92.6%, finding similar first-dose efficacy 92.1% reported mRNA-1273 vaccine highly protective first dose, benefits derived scarce supply vaccine could maximized deferring second doses priority group members offered least one dose. 

So doctors saying wait get first dose wrong date newest South America using Sputnik V 

nope. Argentina, maybe Venezuela using Sputnik V, Mexico using Sputnik well others. smaller countries heard using Sputnik V (Nicaragua, Guatemala). 

Uruguay Chile Paraguay Brasil using Chinese vaccines and/or Pfizer. first Pfizer batch due arrive Uruguay today. also going get AZ Covax. Psycho Las Vegas also go August protesting injustice lockdowns think hotels airlines fucked long-term, except top market-segments, since people money travel massive fixed costs. virus becoming dangerous younger population? 

In country hear every day (from medical staff working fronline) young people getting hospitalized. According officials, infections british variant (not sure one). CVS somewhere else?

I'm Texas, hoping find something little closer Dallas. Plenty rural area outside DFW. lb. Man walks I‚Äôm excited hear this. I‚Äôm nursing 5 month old eligible January vaccine. went knowing right choice. Maybe donate. Surprised given material post vaccine informing do. It‚Äôs scary think different projections would WITHOUT vaccine. Would really expected locked another year more? export ban comes region L'Europe, sparkling allocation doses citizens first. Sorry mean? 1B. 
1A estimated 3M people, 1B estimated 12M people. opened 1B beginning follow NJ vaccine twitter sure get early! line gets pretty long, whole process took hour including waiting period side effects. literal, textbook gaslighting. Also smarmy, dismissive ‚Äúsorry cook home can‚Äôt lick doorknobs‚Äù attitude people cannot seem understand peoples jobs livelihoods ruined. people flat tell face ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù never thing. Jesus Christ. people desperate blame someone. That‚Äôs dedication, might drive back second one  History shows it‚Äôs cyclical. We‚Äôll get both. matter when. happy ending poor guy! if, five days game start feeling symptoms, go grocery store, I'm also shopping?

That‚Äôs evaluate risk. someone isn‚Äôt feeling symptoms they‚Äôre going stay house. already challenge misinformed people screaming rights threatening store workers, Gov. who's supposed backs crumbles fears re-elected. KILLING CONSTITUTENTS.....but guess that's fine economically racially disparaged. used feel NYC suddenly tide started turning, people started realizing absurd shutdown things started slowly opening up. sucks change even realize it. think Texas somewhere bottom 5 vaccinations per capita.

Texas low per capita vaccination rates, consistently used significant portion allotted doses.

States receive equal numbers vaccine doses per capita Federal government, meaning states fantastic job getting shots arms ultimately fail vaccinate many doses.

For example, Alaska given 25% population least single dose, used 70% doses. Texas, meanwhile, used 75% doses given 16% population least one dose.

Assuming Texas used 100% doses, would able get around 21% population vaccinated single dose, assuming ratio single doses fully vaccinated. would still lose Alaska matter great job did.

It's unclear Feds allocating doses. I'd bet median age factor, factor, we'll see.

Texas low median age; one youngest states. Given heavily age impacts death rates, makes sense Texas lower allocation doses. Utah also young, high vaccine utilization, low allocation. Again, makes sense me.

It makes wonder Alaska, slightly younger Texas, high allocation doses. South Carolina, older, lower allocation, despite high utilization. Yeah, I'll looking Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax (if ever approved) turn. one convince otherwise.... unless new studies come show J&amp;J magically improves. Either way, messaging crazy. People need stop trying tell people handle health. Freedumb = dumb. stupid people want autonomy self determination, authoritarian dictatorship much better /s 4 million pretty much nothing 446 million people. change thing. Trolling used much entertaining flamebait-reliant trash batch serves now.

Do better. Good! single dose wasted. well intentioned, tier system states place make less sense vaccine supply rapidly increasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The less hurdles place less likely make things difficult people. excessive documentation requirements locations Florida already seen people legitimate health issues turned away could get ahold doctor fast enough. folks interviewed PCP insurance able get correct documentation.

I'm glad state trying ""free-for-all"" approach thus far thought experiment. gut feeling tells rapidly getting shots arm may bigger uplift COVID-vulnerable community trying arduously target directly. interesting see plays relation states using different approaches. governor, ignoring medical experts, lane? problem UK unlikely restrict international travel vaccinated citizens/residents. would take change law would likely discriminatory.

Come May/June need open outbound travel everyone needs risk assessment destination countries vaccine rollouts.

For example, USA major destination UK residents (myself included) would wise wait proclamation revoked booking travel there, part advice useful common sense. 

I (perhaps unwisely) already booked flights accommodation summer trip US may happen. even source? Thanks info. teacher friends qualify hop told Friday CVS started taking reservations here. available vaccine tracker sites like Bloomberg don‚Äôt disagree makes brexit look good kinda nothing it. it‚Äôs important note Uk nothing eu failures procurement, many. old good article exploring differences seeing today: Karen's going happy stigma comes people touting one dumbest new phrases I've heard lifetime, ""trust science"". Blind faith one unscientific things imagine, 'appeal authority' stupid position take scientists perfectly amoral characters never financial social incentives either bend truth outright lie results. 

Do think happened here? No. seen solid evidence myself. think people, first months, questioned COVID vaccine safety level people refuse get **any** vaccines **ever**? Also no, stupid equation made people love ridiculous 'pop science' stuff online dumb people subreddit treat scientists like comic book characters, people flawed ambitions like anyone else. Holy shit I‚Äôm glad ok. feel like lost this, HCWs. Like seeing idiots protesting wear masks crying freedoms (what freedoms? go fucking Applebee‚Äôs swing target buy shit?), slap face HCWs.

It‚Äôs shame people claim Patriots love military first responders, yet actively engage behaviors fill hospitals ICU‚Äôs.

I friends HCWs seeing Facebook posts pleading people take seriously description experience absolutely heartbreaking.

I‚Äôll forever ashamed turned back HCWs basically told fuck off. couldn‚Äôt least them? devalue service life? 

Anyways, glad recovered made Internet stranger. believe play PR? Seems bizarre, imagine PR could get with, AZ struggling production set another site, plays perfectly EU play book, plus profit vaccine easy distribute third world countries, doses same. I'm sure ""we helped Russians produce vaccine helped make profit whilst it"" play EU's voters. 

There must reason I'm currently seeing benefit producing vaccine authorised many EU ridiculed trials stage rushing, European vaccine approved already. get wrong, see issue Russian vaccine real time results, see benefit producing European ones. I'm sure what's big deal announcement, like ones. States like Georgia 20 others never statewide mask mandate, local municipalities. Georgia also wide open business since August, places 100% capacity cases per 1000 capita states locked down.  
They say follow science time!! I'm fine mask, I'm sure help wear mine time public definitely science behind lockdowns based numbers every month last year per 1000 capita compare open states locked states. missing besides political angle? that's 53% (at least one jab) + 8% (confirmed went virus) + ?% (unconfirmed went virus). saying people went virus without tested? Reality: people fully vaccinated. think like 14 percent. stop community spread. Stop pretending surges exactly experts said would. denial reality Another outstanding performance. pathetic post article didn‚Äôt read?

Will interesting see one pans America can‚Äôt get props shit Reddit Thank God speak UK.

Why anyone would want start vaccine war know.

This point scoring stuff politicians, let EU moan, cares long continue status quo. majority EU UK vaccinated Autumn long fuck others supplies believe either side will. competition. 65% (which higher American data anyway) better 0%. inclined, grab mRNA vaccine booster later date. Take whatever shot mean time. Seems like need purchased individual countries

This EU vaccine contracts. EU commission negotiates terms (e.g. price total pool size) vaccines still individual member buy (pay) them. great news, anyone tried using inside body? act like sort ""protest"", actually government designed. Drop state mandate, individual counties cities decide themselves. This, much this! I'm pharmacist boat. actually could give shots day, vaccine it, except time insane amount phone calls walk counter asking doses, asking extra doses, refusing listen tell go website make appointment. cannot get across much time phone calls taking, literally every 2 3 minutes 12 hours straight.

Some want pissed others living cry studio apartments haven‚Äôt left year hope easy! first shot made feel crappy. sweaty nausea shits poop wastebasket front you. Pfizer could airlift production facility UK today export vaccines tomorrow. cant vaccine ban. like point dont make vaccine orders countries, make private pharma companies.

Don‚Äôt think white &amp; it‚Äôs shameful assumed she‚Äôs white based behaviour luxury. I've already Covid already level protection.

Texans still angry failed policies causing water, power, heat work days. 

Americans mad high gas prices caused mess. reminds times finding false positives kiwi fruits beginning pandemic... OK IDrinkMyOwnSemen familiar area particular, places extra vaccines allotment issues. bear math.

hypothetically 10,000 county 500 work first responders various kinds first wave town got 500x2 shots cover them, say there's native american tribe nearby got 200x2 shots cover them, nursing home got 300x2 shots cover effectively 1000 people already gotten shot. 

now county starts getting allotment based population allotment based number elderly, state maybe put minimum order every county always got least 50 per day, etc etc

suddenly end situation county gotten vaccines people vaccines number eligible people want it. means likely getting less vaccines per day eventaully whatever stock already route keep coming rheumatoid arthritis I‚Äôm Humira. disqualify vaccine, delay taking certain medications choose take it. Definitely check doctor, I‚Äôm saying live vaccine shouldn‚Äôt considered get vaccine. It‚Äôs far better take vaccine experience covid, anyway. I‚Äôve Tallahassee last couple days looking place live I‚Äôm moving next month job. people I‚Äôve encountered wear masks, every store etc I‚Äôve there‚Äôs always maskless people wandering around. It‚Äôs sort shocking coming Massachusetts / Colorado everybody always wears mask, without fail. (I‚Äôve split two areas since pandemic). don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs political issue. don‚Äôt want die!! don‚Äôt want kill someone else!!! BIL volunteered AZ got vaccine. volunteer day get shots. hysteria around kind funny sad. guess gives people chance confirm political priors.

All Abbott's order allow people, organizations, make decisions local level. store want enforce masking distancing, it. one telling can't. now, 15 states (including deep blue Connecticut many deaths per capita Texas) same? Florida issue passed law saying state residents could get it. Oklahoma says must resident sign portal. assume states way. Texas cities Home Rule specifically state constitution? ""How many orders foreign countries sent UK vaccines?""

Thats responded to, even say ban, although admittedly consider export ban.

Look turn way want, fact remains UK exporting vaccines. would love export vaccines country ever ordered them, allow exports one vaccine producing. even matter that's ban exclusivity contract, result sure hell lack interested foreign parties.

And fine, fact allowed that, fact quite understandable, practice de facto ban every way except semantics. Lockdowns strictly followed vote let Benny administer vaccines  think Super Bowl  Try really relax arm get shot. think probably helped second shot. No, wouldn‚Äôt. would applaud finally something anti-big gov. certainly anti-mask. even listen podcast? So, vaccines exported February:

US - 0

UK - 0

EU - 25 million

Italy blocks export 100k AZ, English-speaking media: ""Shame EU protectionist!""

Good NYT setting record straight. second doses delayed, though. got mine health dept. told supposed get scheduling email week second date schedule time second shot.

Got email recently delayed, dont know theyll scheduling... note within 62 days first shot per CDC guidelines they'll email are. sure much intelligent accomplished first jab hurt arm moving helped ton. ice helped too. Almost exactly 24 hours shot, hurt. 

The second shot way painful nothing helped first day. day three hurt anymore. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Not that- I‚Äôve several friends told shot given injected. It‚Äôs unacceptable. i'm sure will. assert influence world taking care home first Link? Curious study‚Äôs sampling method. look 7 day moving average Maryland, essentially flat past couple weeks. issue trend tends precipitate rise cases shortly thereafter. start high baseline, end high peak could devastating gives virus better chance proliferate dangerous strains mutate further.

My grandma though. We've trying get appointment ever since vaccines authorized matter appointments would always booked 5 minutes whether pharmacy doctor county health department. unsuccessful now

It's crazy rollout supposed organized far feeling like trying get Nike drop. think states go direction well.

If want understand why, join local Vaccine Hunters facebook group. mostly super confused senior citizens trying haphazardly sign appointment vaccine. good computer skills. suspect lot lost efficiency logistically here. 

It fine approach constrained. soon become constraint supply increases (like within next two weeks). coverage vaccines also abysmal. media directly comparing 95% 66% months they're scolding people preferring mRNA? Also J&amp;J efficacy numbers include mild symptoms covid success, mRNA ones didn't, right? Yet like news media agreed even talk that.

I get confounding factors favor J&amp;J can't directly compare rates, media blame people feel way first place... Examples? know won‚Äôt 1:1 correlation holding back second shot. North Dakota something similar . even trying pass bill make mask mandates illegal outright , majority conservative state can't stand idea slightly liberal city Fargo governing Right, unfortunately little confusing people. friends work service industry they've already difficult customers... It‚Äôs called joke lol think it‚Äôs common. wonder it‚Äôs British thing think it? get it. really do. believe covid case creates kinds costs. Covid restrictions lockdowns? Absolutely could. covid restrict lock people down. Governmental legislative bodies that.

If costs identified costs due restrictions imposed, would inclined believe it. Simply saying covid case created nearly $50,000 costs inaccurate, opinion. Probably. exact reason tell recipients vaccine trials received real vaccine placebo. Behavior effected knowledge. lol even mean? inoculate entire population based glorified hunch? know many vaccines including HIV vaccines ‚Äúencouraging data‚Äù fell apart proper trial? Follow actual confirmed science - give people doses trials intended. weren‚Äôt questioning move Texas, questioning move liberal city he‚Äôs mask mandates, lockdowns, liberal policy  That's said largely, noted happening washington. Yeah. Maybe delete it‚Äôs accounting snowstorm. didn‚Äôt directly say it.

But government, we‚Äôre pushing second dose 4 months first - something many Canadian infectious disease experts doctors advising against, saying it‚Äôs political move.

His government fire lack vaccine doses. think worry Canadian medical experts we‚Äôre pushing doses apart look better comes % vaccinated - line G7 countries - isn‚Äôt recommended vaccine producers. Sarcasm hard convey effectively writing imo people live Texas Mississippi, wanted ask, public opinion towards mitigation measures look like states right governors removing restrictions? 

Are people going back normal still following guidelines, even though it‚Äôs mandatory anymore? problem Thanks! Making final plans Denali. Can‚Äôt wait back Alaska. study seems like it‚Äôs looking asymptomatic cases too? 

mRNA always symptomatic Covid. I‚Äôve read people think without nasal spray shot it‚Äôs possible still asymptomatic Covid since shot might concentrate enough antibodies nose. J&amp;J testing nasal spray vaccine. agree you, attack CNN. Even since posted, ramped another story motorcycles Florida. months rioting last summer? never saw condemn riots concern spreader event. vaccinated feel like magic shields applied moment walk pharmacy.

This dad week ago. Got first Pfizer/Biontech shot 2/28. called 3/2 asking fully protected shot 2 days. send Pfizer press releases vaccine convince no, sudden protected. 

We definitely need make sure messaging clear stated efficacy truly expected. Constant movement probably help itself. Otherwise there‚Äôs whole lot do. Fortunately, don‚Äôt think people much trouble it. Good luck congrats! Canada‚Äôs delaying second doses 4 months - sounds like endorsement think would offer Canada. it‚Äôs needed would quickly go countries. Although I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt need vaccines need vaccine exports. one same, no? Meanwhile, Missouri, governor punishing cities didn‚Äôt vote him. loved comment people rearranging letters word absolutely drove nuts Bret Favre pronounced name ‚ÄúFarve.‚Äù argued many times family wrong, argument family could pronounce name way wanted. said, OK, pronounce ‚ÄúSmith.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs nuts. change pronunciation grossly, change damn spelling match. think read somewhere Israel, cases actually slightly increased first two weeks 1st dose compared unvaccinated? Perhaps explained people thinking safe early risky stuff? I'm glad EU took opportunity buy additional doses became available.

According Dutch governement/news, additional. early deliveries already ordered batches.  won‚Äôt die. They‚Äôll get mild case COVID, get it, think they‚Äôre absolutely fine. also pass others, die become disabled. since don‚Äôt know others, don‚Äôt care.

I low-risk could probably attend super spreader event right risk myself. don‚Äôt want kill anyone, though, don‚Äôt. 

It biggest shock pandemic people US willing kill others order go party.  guess factory Puurs, Belgium?

I'm also Belgium. I've visited Duvel (translates Devil) beer brewery couple years ago. brewery neighbor Pfizer factory Puurs. saw personalized number plates 2 cars owners Duvel ...666... them. Also cool. *Although hot maybe appropriate case.* Maybe give countries? We‚Äôre going full person (well, option to) coming Monday Guess it‚Äôs cultural thing too. people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúweak‚Äù wearing mask need badly feel tough. three places I‚Äôve lived pandemic good Cali. It‚Äôs pretty rare see someone wearing mask even outdoors

But know lot people indoors friends wouldn‚Äôt bother ""covid"" bill discussed checks, vaccine, school funding only? people know else it? sending money murders, countries besides US US taxpayer money? many things bill even covid related separated many different bills. wife back April, die get hospitalized guess technically would define mild case. holy sh*t miserable, bed ridden 2+ weeks literally barely enough strength eat. recovery process took months feeling 100%.

Don't get wrong, offered I'd take J&amp;J shot heart beat. going totally concern seeing close, given choice I'd much prefer inoculated something higher degree protection. ‚òÄÔ∏è**imagine**‚òÄÔ∏è new variant UK/Kent variant, anyone gets concerned yet another new one. Im getting moderna 4pm. trying figure best ways put arm long. pointers? compress arm ice soon get home? move around. fully expect vaccine put arm. stats back claim. caring mother broke bones, playing nurse time being. constant movement. No, received $500m. Later get billion dollar order, that's much different $2b orders US made Pfizer.

By token, countries ""ordered"" vaccine doses too. we're going count warp speed progress, really counted ""investment"" funding. Moderna, got massive massive help OWS. I'm sure people Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia might disagree assessment greatest need.

I'd argue EU members far greater need Australia. Exporting local supply countries outside EU far better shape WRT case numbers stupid matter slice it.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I'm saying export places like Brazil, MASSIVE case numbers. Australians spent past 12 months gloating reddit well managing covid via lockdowns etc. Seems fine wait months Europe gets hardest-hit states taken care of. know disagree. It‚Äôs haven‚Äôt accepted it‚Äôs opportunity cost (loss income/consumption) figure, rather direct cost number (cost covid healthcare treatment). guess accept then! wrap bubble paper something. It‚Äôs job interpret medical data make executive decisions. say masks allowed remove requirement wear them? i‚Äôm saying Gaping Ass Wound ""For good reason"" okay many people together protest, fun. learned yet?? set types sites rich communities get vaccinated short order let poor folks fend themselves.

Yes, easy reach lot risk people rich communities. That's Shit, even limited site zip codes. haul ass nope right zip.

I mean, shit?  bring enough vaccine vaccinate 1000 people zip, need 10,000 surrounding area showing ""the state"" ""dragging shit"" clubhouse wealthy neighborhood, better fricking ""drag shit"" community center, school, park, whatever, poor neighborhood miles road.

That's point though. can't set random public park expect idea many people going show up. whole point clubhouse set small, tight knit community easy assess/access. Sorry fact hurts feelings. Well year precautions second shot three weeks ago. funny enough traveled gone bars. I'm still enjoying life though knowing we're getting closer normalcy mental health good without worrying it's. Something people sub seem understand Lmao removed weeks ago. say that, they've less shady many competitors. Probably people catch covid others getting vaccinated especially 15 minute wait. 

Some pharmacies still vaccinating enclosed windowless vaccine room 10+ people waiting around near 15 minutes. got J&amp;J morning want echo sentiment. given choice vaccine. Showed gave had.

I'm med school, knew that, school knows that, special considerations. vaccines good enough anyone, whether wander around COVID wards sit basement day. US Pfizer's biggest cash-cow article bologna. One person died connection proven way cost health system $12 billion. Data regarding delayed intervals encouraging. shows people states hopefully smarter reckless governors. Merck rescue. Sanctions apply humanitarian aid highly concentrated areas. take look density map Alaska, there's lot open land that's relatively uninhabited. would frankly embarrassing point yet. suffering save lives? Maybe.

If safe, maybe, could elaborate? half million dead many suffered country alone. vaccine causes arm pain that's people. think clear tradeoff. mean get flu shot whenever offered tone vaccines. Strong vaccination programs means worry thinks like polio smallpox today, fact even need vaccines anymore wish boil things binary yes/no good/bad. Life binary response risk binary.

In case binary, vaccine safe prevents harm, what's downside? I'm seeing concrete downsides. Arm pain? fact it'll take hours time? Tax/insurance dollars? example, think discussion relevant vaccine. think gives superior argument, actually thing relevant.

No, ignore rest fully agree locked down. Regardless think vaccine covid itself. Without government mandates people afraid eating indoors going gyms etc... vaccine fixes makes people start going things, doctor visits, less afraid socialising. nothing mandates people reacting. want life go back normal mass vaccination best route EVEN think covid big deal. reason want talk lockdown us agree, locked down. easiest quickest way renormalizing mass vaccination. like people refuse wear masks despite government mandates, people refusing dine indoors even government said safe - vaccine covid longer safe effective vaccine deaths milk jug drownings, think would relevant discuss number deaths vulnerability milk jug drownings? course would, would asinine put everyone vaccine something might happen 2 people year, matter safe effective is.

Covid killed 500,000 people country harmed tens millions including uncle who's part dead never productive happy again. saying dead americans big deal you? We're talking 2 people year we're talking disease that's hitting millions. 

My brother got sick he's 20's know happened? took 3 days work, stopped eating restaurants 2 weeks taste anything. vaccinated, would missed work, spent money supporting restaurants two weeks ""only"" wasted 3ish hours time getting vaccinated. right binary completely focused death. He's completely fine he's young healthy sick still kinda sucks. vaccine prevents even relatively minor inconvenience. he's part 0.03% mean vaccinate? disease affecting tens millions Americans whether major minor, milk jugs affecting 2 people unwilling discuss role covid response measures comparison damage covid done, discussion had. matter safe effective vaccine may be.

I willing discuss did, actually agree lockdowns. actual thoughts were:

We needed much better job wearing masks, lockdowns. could excellent mask compliance lockdowns less people would died overall economy hurt. Japan prime example this. Regardless whether lockdown, masks, vaccine best way get things back normal. Even thought covid complete non issue, convince people currently think covid going kill go eat restaurants again? Vaccinate them.

I'm willing discuss since answer questions finally. frank discussion knowing one people saying vaccine going kill us microchip us whatever crazy stuff comes out. get ideological need get it, fine. tons people go back normal covid numbers longer high. vaccination combined mask usage best way reduce numbers. record, I've done plenty outdoor dining, even indoor dining since pandemic started I'll know stubbed toe last week watering spice garden cried twenty minutes. works like military. Lower levels make regulations stricter, less strict. principle work here. Where's double ententendre? quite get initial evidence supporting this, thought trigger stronger response, studies still ongoing. John Hopkins US, know there's one UK can't remember NIH university. benefits state million people lol. Really, question lower populated states gotten point yet, especially populations concentrated around main city centers.

Right, AZ angels. thought Sinovac Vaccine. reaching peak effectiveness second shot thing vaccines? uno reverse card! take abbott ;) Bickering political factions prevent US finding effective solutions nuanced problems probably rest lives.  That‚Äôs horrible would get higher premiums getting vaccine medical reason know of. got mine work email evidence trying make sure second dose wouldn‚Äôt late since I‚Äôm already fully vaccinated can‚Äôt imagine would ever need produce those. larger cities either live smaller suburb Austin everyone pretty much thing masking distancing. 77 year old mother gotten vaccinations went get hair cut today first time five months. said person place. People generally keeping guidelines far. think summer change things bit though. 

All big small stores still masking around got email local hospital largest area outside Austin everything remain place following guidelines. email even went way nicely state opposition governor's order. forget this:

Nurses: found way extract doses!

Pfizer: Nice technique there. Would shame something happened vial supply. Variants pose problem ultra desired herd immunity. Nipping bud would literally taken 3 weeks last March society wasn‚Äôt filled egotistical morons. Hmm, soon Would interesting get actual number UK number vaccines exported. Pretty easily would prove right wrong. probably never reached children 16 can't get 

Can't get yet. 

With everything opening, see rates without herd immunity, Covid cause health problems young old, least short term.

I expect that, year now, Israel's children also vaccinated and/or natural immunity. Sounds dangerous. actually already know, article March 5th, Israel lifted restrictions March 7th, see I'm sure trying say, article pretty clear:

* wonder though that‚Äôs due age different immune systems. young healthy person‚Äôs body reacts differently EU who‚Äôve nothing fair, threaten breach NI protocol prevent vaccine entering U.K. Ireland. Italy also banned exports Australia.

It seems EU, also propagated untruths lies AZ vaccine (see Macron‚Äôs comments quasi-ineffective) evidence, banning use 65‚Äôs, reversing decision, massive chip shoulders U.K. handled appallingly. problem big brain struggling right you‚Äôre prideful admit you‚Äôre league plain incorrect. novel virus longitudinal studies incomplete. arrogantly say cell immunity last years total speculation. get doses one bottle **but** US least caveat pharma companies found vials doses shipped less vials contract doses vials. yes, know experts field publishing peer reviewed article post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Every metric still falling, cases, severe cases deaths. May Greece still COVID hotspot. Tourists going flock locked country Greece bars restaurants open May

From I'm reading news, COVID situation Greece seems deteriorating pretty rapidly. nation heavily dependent international tourism, looks like grim times ahead, least far year's tourist high season goes. Maybe UK actually put export ban satisfy EU contract Pfizer runs five years awards Croda initial supply contract four component excipients used production vaccine candidate first three years contract. Demand remains subject relevant produced sites UK US. actually better spot Israel.

That's true, Israel lifted far restrictions US, example we're back person schooling across country age groups, we're going get person universities soon.

US daily deaths 1580, Israel 18.5 (7 day moving average). US population 35 times Israel, daily deaths 85 times.

The situation US much much worse Israel. I'm interested know airport security spot valid vaccination certificate considering they'll different every country airplanes Maybe inform ways Coronaviruses work. article false info it. Israel around 55% people vaccinated least one dose, 97%. 97 per 100 number doses.

With 55% people vaccinated still ‚Äúonly‚Äù 30% people full immunity, take extra month get 60% two months 90%.

Hence lockdowns.

The article paints ‚Äúsee, even 90% people immunity still need lockdowns‚Äù true expose kids.

Time expose *everyone* new strains virus shows signs slowing! Good job. posted article 2017. pertains sars-cov virus, way knowing cell memory it‚Äôs year. ;) Like baseball bat thought, lol.

Keep mind intramuscular injection, intravenous one.

They give option arm get jabbed in; recommend primary arm (right arm right-handed). still dangerous cluster large groups people indoors hours time?  


Because students still catch virus bring home them? 


Because new strains like B117 may worse kids lethal general? mask ventilator hijacking start COVID, yes supposed allies engage piracy other. wish wouldn‚Äôt found Alex Bergerons twitter. dude straight posting anti vax propaganda I'm UK approved here. I've 2 Pfizer jabs, uncle (a kidney recipient, actually, kidney) 2 astrazeneca jabs fine. I'd curious see actual supply vs doses currently administered state state. states sitting giant amount unused vaccine right ""wait"" people show vaccine. 

I think graphic awhile back showed supply vs doses given France number low. 

Kind wish they'd opened everyone immediately although older someone gets greater risk, there's probably good chance they're getting younger person hit effects hard, spreading faster rate overall. 

Plus, we'd able vaccinate larger numbers faster since resistance overall vaccines age bracket timing-wise. Right, kids educators vaccinated too?  


Wait, hmm, something seem smart this.... told that. Yeah, BS scare tactic, absolutely zero chance we'll get another lockdown. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è living alternate reality? EU fault here. Haha respect? Pile actual benefits lets see stack (hint: better nearly every category) posted yesterday's thread asking anyone knew CVS opened new appointment slots, turns midnight dot. Posting hopefully help someone else. doubt, check doctor. week ago feel fine thats great. course start feel ill get touch doctor A+E / ER immediately. 80% still far far away.(and probably never reached children 16 can't get Israel young country. Luckily average Japanese person skinny article 5 days old, BS even BS since. 

There's absolutely chance Israel goes another lockdown. Live Austin. confirm, it‚Äôs pretty awesome. Keep Austin weird! 


And alive. Yeah went online Sat. night found slots open Meijer Monday. Went got Pizer shot scheduled back 3 weeks second shot. Came told time 320 said get line. First stop along way check sign status. Line 100 moved quick took 15 minutes get gave shots. 12 tables set giving one every minute so. check ID, Ins, etc along way 12 different tables. Location Meijer Rockford Mi. 30% people full immunity afaik. take month get 50-60% I‚Äôm mistaken. can't believe people still think ""If locked hard first time position now."" never getting zero covid, advocating policy asking rolling lockdowns *forever* Shit, even go fuckin beach one point. Lol told that? ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù numbers generally tossed around don‚Äôt account fact US usually earmarks second dose first allocated. surplus usually hold already accounted for.

I empathize situation Canada in, US signaled early look us capacity covered. unfortunate side effect investing heavily vaccine production capacity years. I‚Äôm sorry people going upset US also pointing fingers EU. 

As far current output, we‚Äôll soon running true surplus. point hope start exporting allies partners. Everyone Israel get shot since 5 weeks ago. prioritize getting 2cond shot elderly, believe right decision.

Take note chance hell 4th lockdown deaths, severe cases cases still going down.

As metrics based cases, couple things:

1. Depends much test.
2. Kids, Israel shit ton kids. 50% new cases found 0-19 demographic, weighted unvaccinated 0-15 demographics. Israel reopened person schools kids several weeks ago rest week, cases surprise.

This nothing really, deaths 20 day weekly average, still declining. Maybe people smart (and contribute economy) naturally migrate towards city's actually vote parties good society. absolutely correct. mean imply Pfizer bad vaccine (I've two shots Pfizer side effects, although I've tests see antibodies).

I trying say vaccine may appropriate certain condition take certain drugs. Ill edit comment) Please see [our answers frequently asked questions [questions regarding COVID-19 comments containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

One thing I‚Äôm really fucking disappointed about: conservatives **BEASTS** comes staying message. mean it‚Äôs truly amazing. Y‚Äôall usually like bunch little recording devices, broadcasting talking points, verbatim. Yes, it‚Äôs creepy fuck, it‚Äôs also massive accomplishment people feed lies. 

But comes death rate, y‚Äôall say slightly different number. that? numbers hard? even bringing person person social skills equation uncle, kidney recipient, told must avoid Pfizer take astrazeneca covid gives adverse reactions. astrazeneca fine.

A friend moms, also kidney recipient, told (but been; he's considering legal action), given Pfizer vaccine ended ill admitted itu.

Also, work kidney dialysis unit patients advised take Pfizer.

Draw conclusions. Article March 5, 

1. Outdated
2. Even chance 4th lockdown.

It's BS. vaccines work well say do, would another lockdown necessary 80%+ population vaccinated? social distancing restrictions forever plan here? mean, point out, great point. guess I've heard issues south last year may relevance. Something something, Breonna, something, something, Ahmaud Arbery.

My point yes, north racism. quite whataboutism, south still much worse regard. Immunity doesn‚Äôt last, right people zero immunity, it‚Äôs decent thing wait vaccination vaccinated. +1. Poland officials guidelines - someone infected wait least 6 months offer one dose. Greece nearly COVID free while. around October Greece absolutely storming ahead. went wrong. got remember Greece far first world country. cannot cope high case numbers, high hospitalisations economically Lockdowns. therefore worst position Europe moment  What? people buy vaccines supermarket? realize predicted surges actually happened, right? Remember 200,000 cases day almost month Christmas? member opinion. outside lane police chief set Covid policy TIL 13th largest city US, million people considered major city people. Yeah except happened. Except ""Super bowl surge"" never actually thing. mean, forget 200,000 cases day like three weeks Christmas???? know. Sample size that‚Äôs people 3 different school levels 3 different districts 3 different cities. one pretending speculation.

You inventing problem attacking it. People education higher priority young kids get class time teachers safe among kids things without thinking it. 

I believe retail workers phase started. Restaurant employees next. removed state mandate let cities localities impose own. supposed work? story? think made point didn‚Äôt. police chief outside lane. Spanish language? Unless I've mispronouncing whole time... 

Now feel must check immediately. roundabout way, yes. course, smoking usually takes lifetime kill person, COVID takes weeks - there's clearly difference here? apparently, there‚Äôs problem using insulin syringes like this. Pfizer vaccine must injected muscle, beneath layer subcutaneous fat. hand, insulin syringes (at least Japan) needles shorter normal syringes. method used people don‚Äôt thick layer subcutaneous fat.

This isn‚Äôt posted article, heard NHK news. That's valid question. know throw extra vaccine end day don‚Äôt eligible arm stick nearby?

For reason, United States, despite tiny fraction world's population one advanced health care systems human history, responsible one every four coronavirus deaths worldwide. number statistically impossible. 

The United States advanced tuberculosis, leading infectious cause death worldwide, rare hysteria last year half, nobody mentioned even once. despite fact spread identically coronavirus. anyone wearing masks prevent tuberculosis 2018? course not. Why? dangerous. neither coronavirus. 

But really China announced expected Americans stick something ass test disease people could get ""re-infected"" vaccinated whole thing went rails. Assholes always clever half. CDC thing recent obvious confirmation. 

The anti-mask people right along. reason common sense think critically themselves. grown men women make decisions without someone shoving tit mouth.

How catch covid someone else leave home? 2 mins receiving grocery delivery equal going work walking around supermarket terms infection chance? reinforced idea much people embraced various forms theater feel safe. Stuff like ramp overnight. takes time.

Am stroke? Thanks, I'll give shot! He's rich, live different rules. paying attention? Depending believe Texas cities vote blue Austin votes _super_ blue least 10% cities. Austin least one surrounding county turn blue last election, think Texas cities claim same. op reason bring blacks trust nation's doctors medical professionals they've receiving end pretty fucked ""treatment"" doctors, like tuskegee syphilis study, black men promised free healthcare part study actually given placebos never told syphilis. lol argument made group identity. yes, individuals ‚Äúthe medias‚Äù goals much closely aligned say, don‚Äôt control 90% market share. it‚Äôs like saying calling someone rich lazy still person lol. Everything bad exaggerated everything good usually exaggerated media comes covid, seems. 

As variants, data seems suggest current vaccines pretty solid them, producers reporting fine tune vaccines quickly give boosters needed. I'm sure variants slow us some, doom scenario media seems want be. one claimed that, son tried hard Next polar bears Greg Abbots executive order block local governments enforcing mask mandates and/or emposing fines wearing mask? think statewide mask mandate lifted, good Austin keeping mask requirement. 

However can't enforce it, mandate mean anything? Houston, America's fourth largest city. Bars sucked, sit tables ‚ÄúLook tough exposed throat‚Äù something like that. Stop cherry picking  Government small enough drown *you* bathtub.  So-called ""protection"" offered masks coronavirus statistically insignificant. Even 90 days compliance.

I'm waiting pitchfork. care much gets long they're given fast possible. Ok Republican states 20%+ higher rates per capita


Even though minority country I'd rather wait month get mRNA vaccines. really problem shut leaving house week go grocery shopping. one said per capita, son


Texas mess Can't, high might break leg way down. stay Joe Rogan types. lot Republicans heaven too, thanks abbott guess missed part went door door. urge people please please watch video. debunks lot misconceptions spread unqualified people. also speaks important issues like systemic racism he‚Äôs faced working career. He‚Äôs got 6 degrees extremely qualified.  would help administer vaccine want believe in? understanding right? Get high horse. enjoyed reading this. place lot liberal leaning people likely freak asked mask.

It's also place see people also walk around homeless people laying infront doors.

The time I've seen someone tell someone else Austin lady yell walking ramen place ""not homeless"" ""needed money"". odd response ""sorry can't help you"".

Those food trucks good though. Also onion one places decent pizza east coast.

Haven't since 2019, hope get go soon good friends there.

8/10 would recommend anywhere Cali day. might exactly getting either think they're saying is:

&amp;#x200B;

If 100 chances getting covid, 90 get masks, social distancing, level immunity already, factors, J&amp;J vaccine gives 96-97 chance getting Pfizer gets 99.

&amp;#x200B;

I might misunderstanding still, confusing. Well, let's work particular corners. genuinely believe freedom express oneself change rapidly without communal judgement major driving force liberal nature large urban environments.

I completely agree this, also noticed described university culture well here, due high rents urban areas, typically need higher paying job live cities like Austin.

Austin full ""socially progressive economically conservative"" types, though, critical meaningfully less conservative rural areas. passes low bar recommending masks pandemic, saying much...  point posting OP suggests teachers lazy wanting stay home go vacation. absolutely true teachers know. Many - - terrified getting covid getting family member sick. Every day posts parents along lines ‚Äúshut teach‚Äù ‚Äúget classroom find new job.‚Äù spring, parents ‚Äúteachers heroes, give raises! August, was, ‚Äúget classroom PPE guidelines prepared.‚Äù Yes even close #2 hasn‚Äôt said anything masks. OP shitting Joe Rogan. 

He strongly lockdowns good reason though. major cities Texas lean Blue, strongly so- i.e. Clinton Houston 2016 54% 42, Biden 56% 43% stop baby. No. test figures number processed relevant 24 hour period, certain number tests return positive. South +North America, China area, Europe course.

Never asked vaccine status. Either way would anyone keen take away freedoms travel? Well la di da, aint swell. rest world? People think hospitalization surge would happen - understand... would hospitalizing? know still sizeable chunk older people vaccinate, virus rapidly running people hospitalize. week, survivor, texas....... Wtf tell last 4 years. Please share drugs.  are; America football game. exact reasoning wanting J J vaccine. someone household can‚Äôt get vaccinated foreseeable future. want give protection possibly vaccine. That's lot money pool together throw banger parties time. see could back fire  I‚Äôm Boston area, first get hit along NY. went store wearing N95 mask someone wearing full face respirator, chicken rationed, locked everything tourist spots ghost town. March 2020, damn. always funny party run ""they got nothing done!"" party literally vote none first place. totally right, course, works American public. wonder public even interested point. Yes certain people need it, someone makes $90k get $1,200 get zero?

First cutoff $80k reduced amount. Second, making $80k city like NYC San Francisco much money think. Finally, getting either make much money adult dependent (thus, pay bills). neither applies need stop complaining figure get check. Jerusalem Post article data : 

Phizer vaccine efficacy Israel


3.4 5 million vaccinated. fully vaccinated : 

0.14 % caught virus

0.027 % symptoms

0.013 % hospitalized

0.0080 % serious case disease

0.0029 % dead (qty 99) We're talking course pandemic...

Cases usually leading indicator. Israel put 2x many COVID cases 3x vaccinated population. [Poe's Nah one seems different. think that‚Äôs saying cities still mask mandate can‚Äôt close business limit gatherings Sorry, legal opinion spitballing? also layman understanding words says restrict something restriction. reading says private business restrict whatever want based concept trespassing. Restrictions involving municipal building would directly contradict Governor's order unless area meets hospitalization clause. No, totally wrong.

Today, report number positive cases since time yesterday. know many tests carried out.

Tomorrow, report number tests carried time today.

That means match number reported cases yesterday (4,712) number tests reported today there's one day lag (1.53m). dates Government dashboard make completely clear!

See here:  problem I'm teaching person since June 2020 can't get one buddy's district buying bulk teachers plan person til fall ü§£ true, way better Monday we‚Äôve previously had.  confident. aid one pandemic going first six months term. next half years going spent trying recover.,There industries already saying going take longer back 2019 levels.

Ahem...........Give fucking break!!!  really think that‚Äôs going anything?! offer 100 full ride scholarships instead, would gather attention. don‚Äôt give shit Canada lol.... it‚Äôs lower last Tuesday US therefore disappointment. I'm getting people telling it'll make infertile extremely anecdotal, I've seen sub, already Covid, first shot one kicks ass, second. 4-5 hours getting vaccinated, noticed arm feel bit tired. next day, felt like hangover... day that, though, 100% back normal.

Same experience 2nd shot, arm pain worse. never enjoyed one life‚Äôs great pleasures: watching dude hit dingers pound 4th beer  He‚Äôs week folks. 8th March: 4,712 positive cases 1.53m

NO! FFS really simple. know many tests they‚Äôve done. takes 24 hours get results. reported next day.

This couldn‚Äôt possibly easier understand, quite frankly I‚Äôm getting sick trying explain you. We‚Äôre done here. think age based eligibility tiers Isreal has

Some states may exactly contemplate vs opening next tiers previous vaccination plans. help case Florida microcosm looks like US B 1.1.7. becomes dominant variant. looks lot like rest country cases hospitalizations declining. B 1.1.7 going send us back 300k day new cases 130k+ hospitalizations, see starting Florida, just...don't. Yes????? Honestly expecting American cases drop least next year idiotic decisions made states sound like lot enough people showing time. Takes like minute two give jab get new syringe. course take time build 9/hour.

Availability syringes/vials etc might concern well. Oh fucking hell. kind mandate. loves playing Riddler seeing crafty mayors solve way puzzles. Never mind. don‚Äôt make fucking sense anymore. haven‚Äôt months. watching baseball

I definitely see problem.  mom friend it- gotten first shots. Said first one two doses sucked- better getting It‚Äôs 400 hospitalised people 3.3 million vaccinated people. That‚Äôs around 1 10,000 vaccinated. Clinical trials usually 20,000-40,000 participants, trials block people already frail e.g. cancer, bed-bound etc, whereas Israel would vaccinated them.  thought AZN approved everywhere yet... Greece‚Äôs economy dumpster fire Covid. can‚Äôt even imagine it‚Äôs like right now. wife family sounds rough. me, Canada terrible rollout available people yet target every adult offered 1 dose September. would disaster hit point. Alberta going hit June maybe even May. never closed exception Spring 2020. They've open ever since. hope so, though would say kinda nurse want. kinda mean. make sure stay good side want problems, HOA speed dial. Democrats need figure fix fast. COVID relief going old news soon slow, prolonged recovery facing going dominate news. senate can't pass agenda, Republicans going easily able run Democrats getting nothing done. 

Biden already said running again. money Republican candidate DeSantis, going run platform kept Florida open throughout pandemic fewer deaths basically every major Democrat-led state. world making wear mask enter municipal building restrict municipal services? wear seatbelt restrict driving? spread never occurring public begin with, mostly home (especially lower income areas multi-generational households), large outbreaks factories, nosocomial spread, etc. Basically, places people would close quarters extended periods time. negligible number cases traced back things like dining, entertainment, sports, etc.

The reality is, little correlation severity restrictions outcome pandemic (at least US, really follow countries closely). correlation, either weak take account various factors. government never needed get involved degree, need provide information people able safely function daily lives provide resources affected illness - i.e. harm reduction. one individual's fault catching spreading virus need realize that.

Restrictions invasive typically lead harmful behaviors private, non-compliance, general mistrust. thought war drugs, prohibition era, abstinence-only sex education, etc, would taught us now. said, find scenario cases skyrocket place like Texas plummeting throughout rest nation incredibly unlikely. usually, pop early morning, walmart colleges drug stores, one store check  creeping worry mine starting sometime January (I think) getting much worse throughout February. worried going March. think concerned bit earlier people getting semiweekly briefings beginning globalization class taking. talks getting serious time seemed think going get bad. believed her. reason presented good information clearly intelligent person. trying worry much since scares U.S. past (such ebola, bad elsewhere never got bad here), seemed different. really hoping would go away, seeming less likely day. Come March, especially second week, getting tough focus school. 

I remember NBA suspended season. realized lives going start getting affected big way. first glimmer Time Die delayed. supposed come April, pushed back November due going China (huge movie market). wondered movies would get delayed, realize beginning something bigger. NBA suspended ""oh, shit"" moment me, things started feel really surreal. last ever day in-person college classes next day. day spent talking coronavirus fears. asked girl's number sort liked planning get know rest semester. fact knew last day pushed it. got rejected, felt good least it, since knew probably coming back semester. people thought would back within weeks, shit seemed bad me. realize pandemic would last well 2021. still thought would least end summer fall. I'm graduating couple months I'm still online classes (my choice extra careful). Crazy last day in-person classes junior year.

Anyway, long comment, felt good reflect. Thanks question! like daily discussion threads. think variants think they‚Äôre overly exaggerated media? whenever turn news seems like variants bad guys coming back defeat. 8th March: 1.53m tests

8th March: 4,712 positive cases 1.53m

9th March: 5,766 positive cases x announced tomorrow  they'll give free? already stared shipping? trying say?  See, would make sense, hadn‚Äôt said hurricane surge approaching. again, creative writing training kicking in. Lol outlet middle high school aged Redditors complain moms.

I'm stealing one You‚Äôre getting you? tests done. data collated. takes time. data reported following day. [the site NYTimes article posted morning. Well, last oh well. Restrictions done. Mod here. rule necessary editorialized headlines often source misinformation. know, Reddit don‚Äôt read article, headline. yeah, rule unfortunately needed. know follows cases. Let‚Äôs pretend young people aren‚Äôt hospitalized. Half hospitalizations 64 haven‚Äôt really made dent vaccinating young people yet. People vs people can.  Keep wearing yours, think need it. won't. Look dates dashboard. test numbers released today yesterday, number positive cases released today today. 4,712 correct. America making profit giving money vaccines away?

You feel free crap US want to, change fact US adopted strategy UK europe. US ship vaccines internationally want admit believe. That‚Äôs fine. right make health determinations. feel people blindly pushing others take ‚Äúwhatever there‚Äù without detailing risk/reward (organ damage even mild cases) dangerous charlatanism. doses limited next several months

The Biden administration says enough vaccines entire adult population two months, number need people actually take it. majority 65 already least one dose vaccine.  Scan local county website. live small rural town NV able sign family extremely limited amounts vaccinations via county website. take first one tomorrow. It‚Äôs worth shot looking anyone seeking vaccinations! Yeah, point masks/shutdowns/etc. significant effect virus US, hence you‚Äôve seen trajectory play almost every locale, densely populated cities small rural communities. need congratulating politicians implementing things there‚Äôs evidence worked. want compare cities, I‚Äôd pull Chicago, Indianapolis, Cleveland, virus trajectory remarkably similar despite wildly different Covid responses. Throwing LA mix, strictest regulations, gets even crazier, since worst outcome. NBA season got suspended people option coming days / weeks months. It‚Äôs simple probability, 95% 65% regardless much virus floating around. 

Advising people take ‚Äúwhatever available‚Äù charlatanism best, pure immorality worst. Again, even mild cases covid carry potential lasting lung damage. tests done yesterday. Like said, numbers always previous day. Otherwise, would clairvoyant, given release numbers early afternoon. took dark turn lawyer then. read five page order. Nothing saw says mask restrictions restrictions. NI!! look cdc tracking  Maybe so, got papercut top mind üòÇ second someone else said though, made sure watch barely felt all. donate plasma get vaccinated week? either everyone restrictions unvaccinated restrictions. year, able wait another month two, holy shit would gladly step dying Marin antivax soccer mom get shot.

I'm suddenly feeling way too. things considered I've ""zen"" most, sacrificing needs done keeping head down. feels close end, caught damn thing yet, want get immune get done get life back, like RIGHT fucking now. tantalizingly close yet still far every day feels like week vaccine number goes slowly - obviously incredible speed reality, seeing go 89.4 91.2 shit personal level. Thats actually good way looking it.

If fully open hospitals aren‚Äôt filling won. chief may exact level people reporting him, almost certainly wide range access information, includes individuals access individuals.

His responsibilities governor's, sure, also unlikely he's uninformed guy that's spouting whatever thinks.

Both really equally qualified discuss medical side COVID - neither qualified.

Literally medical professionals are.

Economic impact, many subjects certainly affected pandemic obviously within mandate governor example. matter discussing public health, one opinion another unless gov speaking behalf medical professionals state. Let's hypocritical. flip flop think local government able do. That‚Äôs true literally anything, including flu itself. didn‚Äôt shut schools swine flu hits despite higher death toll among kids unknown long term side effects. falling states. Fed projected delivery data time now, really need open eligibility now. Exactly. care fucking myself. Due nature job, however, I'm around schoolchildren teachers day. Gotta protect them. Absolutely. fuck conspiracy shit. think chosen speed trials like Oxford beginning.

Ok, ""Big Pharma"" science denier.

The Oxford vaccine 42 days. ah yes, love crying baby definitely hear rock band ruins show. literally worst! real big brains Facebook resort saying ""now *they're* dropping numbers make us feel safe they're gonna ramp back instill fear!!!"". maybe something incredible like ""cases going down? know vaccinations! people probably randomly staying home wearing masks more!!""

there's winning Federal Government getting hard lesson supply chain promises. Welcome supply demand world commerce. This...

""Go get vaccinated, everyone!""

""OK, gimme one""

""NO!!!!""

what actual fuck... wife pregnant pre covid, flu season heighten awareness crowds surfaces months cause didn‚Äôt want get wife sick

People always germ factories. yeah, I‚Äôm happy go back masks sure... think I‚Äôll likely wear masks grocery stores airports/planes on, especially it‚Äôs bad flu season. I'm skeptical business boom right away since kids can't get vaccine yet. let's real, parents going enjoyment, I'm guessing wait. shirts even ! Really big deal actually. LA county purple since came system last summer. Movie theaters completely closed home Hollywood year case, preference Pfizer due offering highest efficacy, including new strains. Pfizer vaccine also carries risk vector immunity, need second vaccine later year due emerging variants, I'll able receive vaccine product without concerns ineffective me.

(I consider Moderna roughly equivalent efficacy Pfizer, based broadly similar technology. Moderna dosage little aggressive anecdotally comes slightly less pleasant side effects, else equal I'd choose Pfizer.)

I'm still unwilling receive J+J, frequently travel internationally need best protection get contracting COVID-19 abroad environment local health infrastructure may well developed; perfectly fine choice people lower risk, folks want best protection, mRNA vaccines clearly better.

I'm glad AstraZeneca approved country; I'm open considering higher quality data available, existing evidence shows much lower efficacy vaccine options, major questions around study design execution show sloppy attention detail team developed vaccine. Thank you. won‚Äôt. society one cared mental health beyond looking good press. It‚Äôll go back vaccination gets control. another day good ol USA.  Thats lovely story.

But (CZ) state usurped vaccines simply important part society looks (except tax time, important point whole universe). Healthy, young economically active. needs people. summer me. lucky. feel sorry people Austin. posted somewhere above, think someone like DeSantis say better job basically every democratic led state minimizing COVID deaths keeping things open. win lot suburbs back. 

It looks like current senate going squander meager majority, let Republicans run ""do nothing"" platform again, work again. 

Like said, aid distant memory pandemic long since over. huge mess clean next three half years, that's thing going matter election.  embody second paragraph. I'm getting right away simply I'm leaving folks need me. get delivery work home. wait. people say ""everyone offered vaccine"", typically means subreddit means adults. People always disease vectors though, stress COVID. Hopefully next couple months go back worrying diseases people might carrying.  Masks distancing work though what's problem? P quick understand greek healthcare system would able withstand virus like this. put us curfew quickly first wave.

Then summer came. Everything open, everyone welcome. used untested algorithm called EVA created greek ""entrepreneur"" resides US without even backing paper, essence randomly selected tourists tested.

After tourists left, big second wave 100 deaths/day.

When second wave subsided, eased restrictions considerably. time, hospitals gained little terms new infrastructure, doctors, nurses etc.

Covid-19 still people became complacent even care. uptick new cases. new variants abroad became known cases too.

The new variants started spread like wildfire previous month. Hospitals full, doctors scarce, hospital beds commodity, regular patients suffer, covid-19 patients suffer.

It's looking good.

To make matters worse, cases p l c e  b r u l sparked unrest daily demonstrations thousands people.

It really looking good. Exactly seems vaccines working intended. I‚Äôd also interested staff brought vaccinated (I doubt it). see nothing positive story Noticed arm kind hurt lifted head (hurt long gym day). Next day constant soreness level, time went bed barely noticeable completely gone next day! terms qualifications - question asked - probably equally qualified.

I.e. neither medical professionals, therefore offering unqualified personal assessments based information received.

They likely equally qualified. work pharmacy giving vaccinations. wouldn‚Äôt bother looking 3 days. That‚Äôs far advance scheduling, never know many doses getting state department health. Kicks ass flu joke, get flu shots every year.  Catch spending 20 1 crummy beer fwm Maybe *you* are. country isn't.  whether still worry long-term effects get it. dying great, living chronic illness sound like much fun either.  even give cards people lucky given unused doses end day? know stories clinics leftover doses instead tossing them, basically opened door said ‚Äúanyone need vaccine?‚Äù Came say this. chance? I‚Äôd go back ask J&amp;J knowing recent data re: variants 

&amp; say somebody prayed sweet death Pfizer side effects bahahaha Sorry harp this, manifestations COVID matter? Speaking physician experience chronic diseases good news even get infected, less likely transmit virus. Recent studies suggest viral load/level viral shedding infected vaccinated people might four times lower unvaccinated infected people. üôÑ sure problem get rid virus get rid fast enough, together, everywhere virus going mutate never stop. giving away little part poor countries? like doses right now. keep producing themü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
somehow senseless try let understand It‚Äôs funny see people don‚Äôt mask disease vectors. mask reminds I‚Äôm safer. pretty sure thats point. basically creates on-campus bubble versus flying back home town traveling yeah, sucky experience. saw somewhere else rite aid drops new appts. 11:45pm??? seems like game mostly luck, be. Yeah I‚Äôd also want know last second shot two staff vaccine, bet one brought home not. Also many 10 vaccine. would interesting know cases like vaccinated.

Honestly way thing spreads LTC facilities 10 cases 220 fairly good, I‚Äôd assume 10 vaccinated completely yet. Also remember frail society LTC facilities notorious hot spots respiratory illnesses is. Outbreaks coronaviruses flu common every year. aren‚Äôt serious cases ones vaccinated along limiting outbreak that‚Äôs giant win vaccine would require raising money project spending intended.

I predict first bit happen, money spent something Trump's legal fees whims... figures way turn library revenue stream. Awesome! Good hear! felt little fatigue today like 5 minute headache feel good. Definitely feel like weight lifted.  party establishment would love nothing pretend never heard guy, it‚Äôs them. Trump runs, he‚Äôll win nomination. everyone ballot going pretend endless nightmare actually golden age mischaracterized media. think it‚Äôs likely he‚Äôll pretend might run years, back point 2023 though. lol go agsssssss  think lost brain cells reading comment 2 percent per day lot. Exponential growth/decay powerful.  I‚Äôm sure people certainly make large amount folks hesitant take vaccine. think there‚Äôs other, unsettling things play well. father, example, someone I‚Äôve always considered intelligent man. last 4-6 years however, discourse surrounding politics general disbelief science swayed even intelligent people. father went critical thinker someone doubts even good science, saying things like ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs made up‚Äù that‚Äôs way peer reviewed science works. He‚Äôs engineer read lines peer reviewed papers gather opinion, chooses blind disbelief instead. think see lot nowadays deeply concerns me. Healthy skepticism good that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here. Please don‚Äôt call local pharmacy. Please use scheduling tools online via vaccine hotline. work one started giving public. severely understaffed unfortunately time hundreds extra calls per day tell can‚Äôt help make appointment. long term care nursing home since vaccinations started. cannot make appointments phone. extra doses. waitlist. reason dose expire allocated someone missed/canceled appointment, goes staff giving vaccines. glad many people want get vaccinated, given many doses. I‚Äôd love able accommodate everyone wanted get one. shortage doses, warned corporate shortages syringes well. There‚Äôs evidence this. People want think flu makes easier understand, it‚Äôs flu. It‚Äôs whole thing. vaccines effective covid flu shots flu. already corona viruses cause colds year, particularly deadly compared flu covid 19. really know yet, observational data. Kids dying much reporting many long covid symptoms, early blase dismissive potential long term impacts catching childhood

This virus infects sorts organs including brain, knows lead to. Dakotas didn‚Äôt significant Covid restrictions still saw curves decline holidays happening. viral seasonality work. fuck conspiracy shit. think chosen speed trials like Oxford beginning. That‚Äôs read well.

Edit: given worded, doubt state sues them. Seems pretty intentional.

And makes sense. Places like Abilene less need mask mandate Austin Houston. Good hear. second dose today Pfizer. Arm immensely sore otherwise ok, died covid19 going well overall. Thanks. I've camped computer hour every morning checking anything last week half luck. honestly think they'll risk running Trump again, though whether tries something insane remains seen. get treatments covered

Are effective treatments already? Lol reason haven‚Äôt gotten flu people around gotten vaccinated, you‚Äôre lucky immune. part. else bill, hide time? nurses I‚Äôm talking wondering lose cool resort name calling. seems like common theme comments. make good point people continue stay home, I'm going bother responding since decided impatient disrespectful.

Or perhaps isn‚Äôt time yet. Valid totally appreciate that. never told opinion wrong. certainly gave space yours. 

I'd say I'm akin something it. I'm talking public forum. exact thing. 

Appreciate thoughts- probably going nowhere feel free take last word this. may agree disagree, fundamentally I'm sure far apart glad might ending soon. 

Take care right 7-day average.

You didn‚Äôt say cases, said deaths. US higher. Israel testing, finds cases. countries confirmed cases per million entire pandemic despite Israel 40% number deaths. Also people vaccinated cases aren‚Äôt much predictor deaths. Younger people Israel congregating risk largely protected.

[In Shift, Vast Majority New COVID Cases Israel Age totally agree fair like Hunger Games get vaccine, people traveling far wide get vaccine. think thing course always updated minutes somebody gotten appointment listed, also lots people refreshing waiting jump appointment shows up. still think truly worth shot. took many tries, able get appointments think. think registering mid-michigan county health departments also worth shot since seem more. saying second dose needed. needed within 21 days. agree probably done speed phase 3 trials.

You appear repeating conspiracy theory manufacturer's intent provide maximum protection everyone.

Was clear enough years evidence selection 21?

21 odd number world vaccines second dose.

Going beyond 21 days significantly dangerous serological confirmation post-immunity. going pretend Florida reporting accurately? wanting discussion? so, last sentence makes question even begin you. look least virus itself. real issue muscular guys fairly easily accounted ""fat"".

There also issue tall people overweight/obese BMI actually healthy weight.

But like muscular people enough change much population level. Yeah, it‚Äôs shitty situation. don‚Äôt blame though - lot people afraid Covid risks it‚Äôs reasonable assume clients wouldn‚Äôt comfortable knowing maskless sessions others. ‚ÄúHelp researchers‚Äù - excellent point. mean, want play society's rules show basic human decency compassion people around welcome give truck/phone/internet/beer go starve death cave. even mask free it! Yay freedom! relate... problem spreads lot. B.117 spreads, chances mutate something even worse, maybe something renders current vaccines almost useless. Okay, GQP‚Äôs answer problems run guy caused them. won‚Äôt play well 2024 things much better 2020. Social media savvy people getting people extras end vaccination clinic day.

Hopefully Austin finish job unlike tree fell him. someone gets really sick flu, even vaccinated it, disagree. feel way. also mentioned students work PLUS teachers.

This person clueless. Dec 2019 COVID, need test.  crime exactly? law violate fine prescribed? Yes, Pfizer slightly effective. huge percentage anything like that. 3 effective, get whichever one get. Holy shit *one joke* end here. flip flop think local government able do.

These Governors taking gamble. vaccines rolled out. lot people already infected brings level immunity even without vaccinations.

Theoretically yes, stricter governors keep finding excuses stay closed cautious possible, even real-world evidence reopening doesn‚Äôt cause surge cases. may first state-wide offer vaccine adults, states offered vaccines anyone specific cities, usually low-income minority-heavy cities. example, Rhode Island opened vaccine anyone city Central Falls: thing open gen pop done challenge trials 9 months ago. everyone clap screamer too? I'm guessing least another year gap even Pfizer currently backed real world data UK 2 months. data aspects immune response used fill gaps.

Mild infection invokes solid nAB concentration 4-6 months decline begins. Doesn‚Äôt mean soon decline begins you‚Äôre sudden 100% susceptible, start getting susceptible. 4 months shots leave without nAB decline get second shot.

But given supply ramp up, Canadians probably won‚Äôt wait 4 months shot. 30-32M eligible people Canada, let‚Äôs say 90% want shot. That‚Äôs 28.8M maximum, 27M lower bound. 36.5M guaranteed doses June 21st apparently (cumulative December till then), 90% eligible Canadians take shot, supply vaccinate approximately 7.8-9M 2nd dose end June. Obviously, doesn‚Äôt include supply J&amp;J, Novavax, AZ, number could grow.

The study see increase covid19 infections related pollen well. 138 US, 101 France, that's quite bit better. suspect Covid19 spread easily France US (much higher population density, much higher use public transportation vs individual cars...) conclusion rich people wide-ranging connections lower end income scale, means maintain social lives, despite lockdowns. increases risk previous study showed higher percentage upper socio-economic groups live cities, higher infection rates elsewhere population rich larger houses apartments, many second homes, able continue hosting friends home, despite recommendations limit social interactions, especially shared meals, shown spread Even working home protected wealthiest, many afford outside childcare, could also explain increased infection rates. 

The real difference wealthiest taken lockdowns vacations curfews opportunity invite friends night, behaved pandemic.

But would dick move, UK stoop eus level banning vaccine exports like Australia share think governments selling tobacco products like, - nothing we're talking clearly obvious.

As far question - definitely blame Biden implementing federal mask mandate. think that's pathetic leadership. However, considering previous president telling people drink bleach stop virus, (or whatever fuck coming pathetic excuse man's mouth) - current senile old man president nothing improvement. fact country run degenerate, incompetent government blame doubting them. like said, account 25% death toll virus 4% worlds' population.

I feel like I'm trying fan toxic gases chemical fire away country moment - please wear masks.  It‚Äôs bad messaging pretending . vaccine tested trials prevent severe illness death. Vaccinated people still catch transmit virus. requiring vaccine passport normal requiring one?

If country largely vaccinated, would visitors need vaccinated? EU: need vaccines Australia! right take them.

I'm picturing describe going $1350 anywhere actually think Austin. saying opinion matters. I'm confused. People always think age rgr determinant really odd me. states say they're opening certain ages, means age *only* thing required. states vaccinating whole lot that, varies state. Good point conflicting Vaccines? Good. End masking giving shit/variants? good.

I‚Äôm guessing vaccinated, life start go back ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù us still wait shots, pandemic definitely potential get worse, whether one taking precautions not.

It‚Äôs serious make break moment fight US.

""Masks times?"" would even know this, let alone many people it? ""Not insignificant"" vague, idea vast numbers Americans want ""chang[e] lives this"" permanently even stay home Christmas ridiculous. usual bullshit reasons, want wear mask, instead owning it, dreamed scenario someone blame. Half million Americans dead are, bitching third-rate CNN puff piece. Yeah, think ridiculous. also know change. actually wonder ""why people good boys girls social distancing masks,"" though; abundantly clear why. UK dementia stating export ban, export ban?

You understand UK using locally produced doses, thats ban export, giving priority people.

Hardly surprising given worst mortality Europe generous, give 30 days. ton people laughing, ton people pretending weren‚Äôt completely brainwashed direct comparison two data emerging UK, far seems indicate Pfizer similarly effective AstraZeneca. trials done vaccines done different circumstances can't really look efficacy. would work even better, get vaccinated forcing sick people stay home via police. number often quoted public health experts that's around number people typically died flu day average pre-covid. logic being, covid killing people less flu typically would, longer critical health crisis. obviously arbitrary means universally agreed upon public health experts, fairly common metric referred to. makes sense me, take will.

Trying get people understand difference interesting test patience. Masks aren‚Äôt needed

-Fauci, 2020 variants causing temporary plateau spread faster end game still - vaccines work Sounds awesome. Hope attendees fun! Wow, that's amazing! know 70% Americans classified obese overweight. basically, proving anything.

Nevertheless, old people also dying much faster rate, tell stop old. fix it. looking NY Times vaccine data state noticed lot states ranked near top % population given least one dose cold weather states. pulled data Excel cross-referenced avg temperature state correlation coefficient -0.53 (meaning colder state higher vaccination rate expected be). statistical terms -0.53 moderate correlation, still means seems correlation right now. would've thought would reversed given challenges colder states faced snowstorms considering vaccination process taken place entirely winter months. Anybody theories what's causing this?  Distribution greatly outpacing administration. Lower age threshold [As someone Florida counties thing. Always have. DeSantis ordering facemask mandate would've null counties decided beforehand either enforce &amp; lockdown hold (which led [pictures beaches packed one side &amp; empty whole family Texas arms feel bad think several deeply upset it. They're also vaccinated none work outside home. masks come point. Im going wear mask there's mandate I'm vaccinated prove.....what? dont know! sure seeing conflicting data. everything I've seen points 2 weeks vaccines. I'd go far call insulting. Many colleges treated students *terribly* last year. addition charging full rates limiting access almost everything students' tuition money supposed pay for.

Side note... think COVID might thing pops higher ed bubble. I'm asking without knowing answer all: 30% (roughly) distributed administrated better worse we're used to? large number people hesitant it‚Äôs states job open eligibility. Appointments going un-used. sad, one person many vaccinated? relation determined. chances still far greater die COVID.  EU politicians really shot EU foot long term putting place export ban, time tell actual affect.

There export ban. export controls, means authorization required vaccine shipments exported. one shipment AZ vaccines scheduled go Italy Australia (250K doses), exports cleared proceed. fate 250K AZ doses yet determined may still end going original destination (they've confiscated, blocked shipped time being). True, although infection rates still important majority folks vaccinated sort herd immunity takes hold.

Hospitalizations also remain important indicator. places definitely managing better others. Especially choices kill people, right? tells need work together make whole civilization thing work. hope agree that.

I'm annoyed attitude food sent cities free. There's also water bills, electric bills, taxes pay military patrols. news child age 7 dies 4 days eating peas. Indeed, current rate looks like we‚Äôll low hospitalizations deaths summer  reason, even remote thing agreeable thing COVID partisan. think point article they'll keep masking distancing pandemic underway, after. They're saying despite governors making decisions they're still going listen health experts. 

I think listening data sound science virtue signaling, whatever that's supposed mean instance. Governor eliminated mask mandate today. today, businesses could require masks worn stores powers said so. it‚Äôs stores enforce mandate expired. Stores don‚Äôt want burden, many places turned violent don‚Äôt want put employees position. stores still (loosely...) enforcing masks, like Target Kroger, others simply requesting customers wear leaving there.

So yes. today, walk Market Basket without mask nothing happen. Yeah I'd still avoid them. Although crazy situation like fell get someone unvaccinated, Id go help whatever. hang fun  feel like TX soon follow quite yet, major cities lack doses rural areas surplus, many 1a/1b able get dose yet hard time finding it, however drive several hours away likely get dose right away. Instead opening everyone, least TX, rethink dose allocation major cities receive doses smaller county less demand receive bit less, get close 70% 1b vaccinated (those wants it) feel open all, need another 1c category. rules make sense. travel fully vaccinated people? It‚Äôs total rubbish. Missouri issues. Rural areas got many vaccines cities ignored.  governor idiot. evil. both. Honestly nerve [The ask black latino communities getting vaccine less. reason people aren‚Äôt getting orgs like NPR. say someone consumes every day god heard Tuskegee Experiment like 4 times week listening two them. highlighting reluctant people giving megaphone put fear made seem normal. problem cant tell *why* looking doses used. number 65% could state clusterfuck cant mobilize use doses received, large number people hesitant get vaccination, reason. anything, people following rules made pandemic shorter US. Immunity prior infections help us reach herd immunity faster. disagree behavior lot spread COVID, think anyone say sure numbers would look like X% increase mask wearing, X% decrease parties, etc. point is, think there's realistic change could've happened would get us restriction-free 2021. (I keep saying ""realistic"" people want legitimate widespread police enforcement strict social distancing one leaving house unless absolutely necessary - regardless opinions approach, there's way realistic US)

In hypothetical approach US see increase mask wearing social distancing, decrease ""non-essential"" interactions, let's say cases would 30% lower US. 30% fewer cases deaths would amazing, doubt it. thing *still* would following restrictions around time. soon people stopped diligent masks distancing, cases would immediately rise again. cases 30% lower ended being, still go concert March 2021, would type thing happen hypothetical world. that's point - one ""prolonged"" pandemic. could've taken actions prevent deaths, inherently involves *more* restrictions, soon drop restrictions, cases shoot back up. Meaning even hypothetical world, we'd still wait vaccine, like got doses Moderna vaccine. long til I'm maximum immunity second shot? see (conflicting) data shot Moderna one. Thanks! talking rules? Released Monday: hugely important Chris Murray University Washington Washington University. two different places live world exist anymore.

But could exist snap finger arent careful Yeah 30's early 40's late, I'm Alaska You‚Äôre low risk you‚Äôre still distancing vaccinated friends family?

They're old breastfeed young get vaccinated. Also, drink antibodies? Healthy, retired 40 year olds thing covered. far, health officials believe new variant strain causes severe illness reduces effectiveness vaccines

Frankly needed hear. Infection rates important used since vulnerable targeted American vaccination efforts. Obviously terrible countries lacking vaccination efforts, hope spread significantly outside United States, domestically think great deal increase deaths hospitalizations. And? deliver 4 million every 2 days EU Q2. Biontech Pfizer really unstoppable supply chain! also serious whataboutism context. IMO, point, legitimate debate whether best focus efforts elder, whether effective targeting certain vectors transmission.

All nations done calculations (including fact young people much life live) still come conclusion old prioritised chance serious illness death vastly higher. 

Considering hundreds dieing every day Spain, vast majority group, obvious prioritised. Spain's hesitancy simply yet accept data efficacy elderly, strategy prioritise likely exposed. 127.9 Million doses Distributed

2.0 Million Administered today

4.7 Million Distributed today

only 74.8% total doses Administered, think time lower age limits... True, rural counties gets doses per habitants others, major cities lack doses people driving hours hours counties lack local demand. incredible majors cities TX hard time willing drive easily get elsewhere. rethink allocation doses. real, I'm deployed right now. Maybe we'll get sooner later thanks J&amp;J's vaccination storage requirements, really get would need faster anyone else.

Plus case, catch it, 10 days paid quarantine long-term/permanent ill-effects it, we'll probably get serious disability pay life. Indeed. Nohynek's (the health official) vaccine comments least explained fact finns vaccinated now, sort similar Fauci CDC said ago. course, kind messaging undermines vaccines leads confusion eventually backtrack acknowledge facts vaccines. kind goes article linked, media jumped scaremongering part.

The PM's comments meanwhile irresponsible beyond belief, especially since people loosing current curfew plans haven‚Äôt made claims. Cool, well I‚Äôd rather give $10,000 wear mask around me. It‚Äôs gonna whole lot everybody instead wearing mask around idiots 10 months ago, problem. Australia New Zealand gone completely back normal without masks took seriously think it‚Äôs political poll includes coronavirus stuff. coronavirus poll includes voting demographics.

I'm 100% sure point leaders think ""as long people survive big deal"" Definitely interesting experiment herd immunity Missouri's governor college degree... people try go normal early, end lockdowns.

Australia handled well they're back normal right now.

But go I've working getting appointments people company. We're essential grocery employees without ability work home. vast majority us want vaccine. Many I've talked find 'one done' JnJ appealing. 

Since mass vax sites area using JnJ, rapidly increased percentage staff received full vaccine schedule. Try KN95s KF94s typically designed smaller faces. feel like hit brakes every time new variant announced, restrictions never end. reads like emojipasta lol Chicago, pretty much everyone follows rules. I've seen maybe two people stores etc wearing masks mouths past *year*.

Masks made obvious toxic people are. gonna say, feels pretty good tbh CVS near wait list could sign for. staffed information desk inside store. First hate fucking masks. 
But know CDC stats 70% adult population vaccinated way I'm taking mask stores. get second one Friday even though seems pretty good stopping spread dude gets weird shit. two cases chicken pox, I've gotten shingles 32, I've gotten HFM kid daycare get damn thing. I'm taking god damn chance health. Yikes end May every adult American wants vaccine least received first dose least half received doses (or 1 dose J&amp;J). would bet money this. Production continue accelerate well distribution/scheduling/injections. point May, 4th vaccine (Novavax) also likely approved US. We're track normal Summer amount fearmongering VaRiAnTs CHiLdREn change that. Im sure understand.

So agreeing development amounts positive tests texas going good direction? think they're running people. think tiers opening combat this, fiance got notification yesterday he's eligible he's 1B tier 2, maybe ball starting roll there. tons slots got even choose shot wanted. demand current eligibility seem quite keeping up. 

I think Newsom setting March 15th start date 16-64 health conditions 1-2 weeks late.

Went work tuesday learned CVS vaccine. supervisor said, prioritizing people 65+ employees could get standby leftover doses. 

Also found Target paying workers get vaccinated (2 hours per dose language ambiguous regarding one dose vaccines) paying Lyft rides vaccination sites. Overall I‚Äôm pretty impressed pleased region‚Äôs Target‚Äôs efforts. 

Can anyone update Walmart doing? used work awful, especially compared Target. I‚Äôm curious they‚Äôre anything employees respect vaccine. likely 100% keeping alive, fear DFW resident, I'm rooting fail. wish capacity limited.

I want full crowds sporting events much anyone. fact, personal marker ""normal."" according Dr. Jha, we're damn close ""normal"" it'd best push last weeks. We've survived year without full crowds, make least weeks regular season. am, they're going START vaccinating 90+ March 15th. Yay Canada. I‚Äôm really hoping Friday numbers break 3M next week see 2.5-3M 5/day avg weekdays. I‚Äôm guessing tomorrow it‚Äôll hard get appointment that‚Äôs 50-59 year olds finally start making appointments. Relax, chicken little. I‚Äôm still waiting super bowl surge. want know too. That's one getting end month barely find information it, 50.4% efficient Brazil 70% Turkey. country close Brazil would concerned. well unfortunately next goalpost moved that. epidemiologist, effects increased vaccinations Israel definitely seen reduced bad outcomes. Younger people probably riskier therefore getting sick. I'm eager things happen, feels like takes forever check every day. R0 gets 1 eventually cases disappear. vaccinations make happen quicker! Usually buy something, take ownership point. demand supply. buy, supply get. less chance people wait appointments. websites sign appointment absolute garbage. Buggy, require ton demographic information CAPTCHAs reach end find particular site fully booked back square one next site. Yeah, would ban export components? would hurt (aka Pfizer might export less UK without them). 

If EU would ban exports UK UK stops components. EU could say: ""well, get even later"". would childish (from sides).

To sum up: UK produce much vaccine begin ""small"" overall market compared EU (66M 440M). Stopping exports UK would help EU significantly.

It's sad state. Theoretically EU least prepared US tackle vaccination factories know have. Little bit bad luck mostly bet Sanofi AZ...  Yeah Washington State. throwing vaccine daily Eastern WA lack interest. Meanwhile people rabidly seeking vaccination Western side there's way less opportunity so. We're never getting past huh.  go state school NY wear masks walking around campus outdoors. Especially gorgeous day like today it‚Äôs fucking dumb. Even contagious yet 7 day case avg dipping since February 3rd. keep wearing mask get vaccine possible. Maybe, even need it? Alaska actually fairly poorly distribution based doses used vs doses received. 

It sounds like good job getting doses remote places throughput great. state pause vaccine clinics due lack supply late February. live Seattle county used 93% doses yesterday get new supply Sundays. yes, distribution definitely throttled due low supply areas. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Makes sense since older adults (65+) vaccinated? 1 gazillion % deadlier. fEaR roNa Idk, think 3.04x10^64 kind unreasonable age limit. got first shot 2/28. days arm soreness nothng. True Yeah recently felt like either lie select group vaccinated. parents partly vaccinated teacher friends too. Wider availability seems imminent (weeks rather months). oh. yeah would big problem sure :P Yeah, *NY Times* article cases weird blood disorders following vaccination: supply go up, solve biggest current issue. received million doses per day, would injecting million people day.

At point could hit bottleneck sites needles personnel far today. assumed 1.6 million people already infected (so twice confirmed case count). 1.6, assumed bit half (1 million) ALSO vaccinated, there's .6 million added ""some protection"" total right sense companies said would deliver. note 2-3 week delay company considers delivered gets arm. 

So pfizer + moderna say 220m doses end march, mean 110m people first dose end March. would probably happen time 2nd week April China got make money mess. Convenient supply longer issue, REALLY expanding vaccination sites hours, well thinking offering doses all. getting really frustration 30-40% current eligible population refusing vaccine rest us staying home responsible get it. know mean. referendum tomorrow, I'd struggle justify voting remain. means 2m doses reported administered CDC since yesterday's update. doses actually administered days ago. mothers said mRNA linked early abortions child deficits

Please try convince lay Fox news and/or Facebook news, straight propaganda. Like, genuinely harming entire society type lie spread.

(I repost comment edit overzealous mods thinks two words put together makes entire post ""purely political"") That's fair. know there's public data compares general mortality rate public mortality rates vaccinated people? mean, seems likely horrible coincidence, also understand family convinced vaccine killed since probably trying rationalize death. guess I'm somewhat concerned outright dismiss stories important get vaccine there. neighbor Frank makes vaccines moldy banana peels bleach. saying that's effective? messages sent unwarranted leaving reviews kinda cringe. one, welcome patronize establishments. Two, exposure least 15 minutes close interaction infected individual.
Your risk manage, impose others. Businesses rules place protect employees, wasn‚Äôt really Super Bowl itself, festivities surrounding it. remember seeing pictures packed streets Tampa almost one masks on. Uh yeah. 100% massive cause anti-vaccine sentiment minority communities (Black especially) caused media Tuskegee Crime. It‚Äôs causing huge distrust vaccine extremely safe efficacious. It‚Äôs preying ignorance replaying clicks experiment started almost 100 years ago one things like it. many people safely received smallpox, Chickenpox, Shingles, MMR, Covid vaccines? NYT, NPR ashamed themselves. Minorities need trust system now. spooked something wasn‚Äôt even vaccine 100 years ago. Same, mom's 59, Chemo more, still treated immunotherapy lung cancer, even prescription vaccine, can't get appointment yet. Northern Texas, panhandle. Surely complicating actually slow rollout/cause problems? Keep simple opinion

Edit: would also vaccinate large portion population border areas establish kind localised immunity. Would suck everywhere else vulnerable fully vaccinated lol would Pfizer want offshore manufacturing production overseas? Pfizer self-manufacture, create grow homegrown, American-made coronavirus vaccine plants right U.S. They're underrepresented susceptible. Basically vulnerable group. Thanks reply. reassuring maybe also distributors located. Seeing lot people Minneapolis area driving hour two rural areas snap appointments. Seems like places supply need others can‚Äôt get enough.

This anecdotal, course. hurts fall head you‚Äôre old that‚Äôs happens guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'd hope end goal stop spread, eliminating symptoms transmissability that's way truly eradicate this. stop symptoms put risk leaky vaccine. Right, I‚Äôm disagreeing, saying abandoning priorities really fucking sick disabled people throwing everyone age pool matter health status going lead people dying didn‚Äôt to. There‚Äôs great opinion piece Post today. AZ fucked us tune 40 million fewer doses delivered 1st quarter. kept exporting doses produced Europe instead honoring contract EU.

Compared that, getting 4 extra million doses great, Pfizer get praised it.

I would buy everything Pfizer make AZ pay it, like Trump made Mexico pay wall. Time Balto 2: Electric Boogaloo glad glanced reading wall-o-text see boils OPINION ü§£ü§£ü§£ Interesting. heard J&amp;J trial young children. According NY Times [link] J&amp;J trial 12+ trial younger children. it'll still trial young children starts.

But, still good news! Despite repeated efforts obscure death toll, DeSantis managed handed vaccine deciding open nursing homes back up.

Did death toll rise? Yes. Dramatically.

Did make Flirida premier spot rich tourists come take spot line locals needing vaccine?

Yes... like spent millions taxpayer dollars vaccinating richest, whitest, least risk populations first long donated hundreds thousands reelection fund.

Did manage saved timing vaccine?

It's impossible tell yet since he's still got someone working full time UN-certify registered covid deaths drag official accounting added weeks longer transparent ploy make death toll look like constantly improving.

... exactly like Rebekka Jones said would right demanded arrested ever shifting premise, sent state agents AR-15's house family held gunpoint despite complete sham since logs needed already found state server anyway, Florida law forbids forced entry domicile sole purpose retrieving computer without mitigating exigent circumstances. Past tense. realize long haulers thing, psychosomatic. read ""daily"" growth rates, overall. definitely daily compound growth rate? would add ton! claimed it‚Äôs normal ANYWHERE. fact large chains mandate masks mean areas country gone back normal. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve heard well. saw data common. bad administration isn‚Äôt placing priority US military personnel (especially overseas) receiving vaccine. Yeah read several accounts one Florida sites people medically eligible could get note PCP (if one) time. agree better remove documentation requirements. Ah ok. checking context. Agreed.  
Edit: also I‚Äôm sitting coffee shop everyone still masks on. Nothing changed hope straighten mess you. seemed like state next first, suddenly started moving. hope that's case you, start getting widely available fast. even mean? inoculate entire population based glorified hunch? 

This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhunch‚Äù. know fact [longer intervals makes AstraZeneca vaccine *more* effective. Canadian researchers found Pfizer moderna vaccine one dose extremely effective, thing don‚Äôt know sure long immunity one dose lasts for. medical experts note: 

‚ÄúSkowronski De Serres cautioned may uncertainty duration protection single dose, said administration second dose month first provided *""little added benefit short know many vaccines including HIV vaccines ‚Äúencouraging data‚Äù fell apart proper trial? 

Well good thing vaccines passed proper trial. *We literally 20 million person [case longer intervals UK*.
 
The fact matter delaying interval *will* save lives. rewards outweigh risk opinion. Yeah you‚Äôll notice big decrease later today probably making sure people looking numbers indicator wisdom/stupidity governor's new rules (or lack of) exactly this, school tests rapid ones test centres actually false data same.

Typical govt would this, way lie/ mislead make something look better  problem people (any age) getting vaccine need - get permission doctor.

Right now, many states (i.e. Georgia, South Carolina, Texas) anyone claim qualify (cheat!) ever verify it. That's fair underlying conditions... people 60. interesting. first jab arm hurt like mother. Couldn‚Äôt lift head 24 hrs lol. Second hut bit less whole body symptoms makes available rich people. Social media influenced anxiety real thing. goes way either Covid deniers Covid extremists. I'm middle, realize thing another flu also realize death sentence like Ebola. think majority people like take seriously is, people farest ends vocal. public messaging political nature throughout whole thing terrible I'm sure helped. Plus leaving EU really helped UK terms vaccines. like bizarro world every bad decision accidentally becomes good one. 

What's opposite monkeys paw? think that‚Äôs common second dose. Walmart also posts new appointment slots following week midnight day. That's voluntary export ban, that's: made contract first, get fulfilled

The EU throwing shit, losing friends alienating people company made sure employees got hot Johnson injection. thing since vaccines first made available still is. lot places residency requirements people come out-of-state. First all, much interested returning many people possibly flying traveling.

And even that, *like almost every corporation*, interested staying red turning profit. 

There glorious humanitarian goal simply get people travelling flying benefit.  United charges lot, people switch Delta JetBlue American.  

And Delta, JetBlue American raise prices 75% United does. They're still competitive, they're still making money.  would literally pay $100 fly like Covid without quarantines, required testing here, etc. 

And that's probably they're hoping for. 

They charge *only* $25 extra supposed benefit, happy 'saving' $75 they're happy they've squeezed $25 you. 

Just look performance cost airline travel last 30 years: we've gone 2 free carry-ons 2 checked pieces baggage plus illusion customer service in-flight meals flights greater 3-4 hours.... paying carry-on larger small purse plus checked baggage, apathetic customer service akin cattle herding, tiny boxed lunches sodas hawked many flights. 

And one airline it. forces competition within industry may exist, restrictive would believe. Reality low numbers 30 100 percent seems scary first glance realize ACTUAL death rate probably .05 percent covid classic. mean, it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre acting like EU high horse generously giving away vaccines rightfully theirs. reality EU another customer queue, happen production facilities region. talk vaccine nationalism blame game distract voters failure act decisively, quickly, unity. Problem managing appointments. everyone becomes eligible time, impossible find appointments many (particularly non tech savvy) may become discouraged trying. remember Vice video damage antibiotics village India lab dumped antibiotics water supply turn created antibiotic resistant superbugs problems local population. video years old even discuss dangers overusing antibiotics, shame we've learned nothing. Hopefully nothing bad comes this. strongly doubt I‚Äôm American appreciates working home. quite. complicated know ""at time"" stuff keeps said. Duh! know catch time. we've seen eyes many 200k day will... more. That's enough totally slam things. Especially much folks getting time. okay much longer going expected wear mask ""for good society"" (yuck)? feel like comment kinda proving masks symbol compliance morality point rather actual tool mitigate virus.  joking? Good time remind people vaccines (idk astrazeneca) generally really good reducing severe illness covid, even less effective preventing infection.

Get shots folks. FUCK AZ !!!!! Also, never said JnJ bad vaccine. said comment JnJ single dose vaccine ""an advantage"". trade-off. vaccine's first doses efficacious better. point like one's immediately critisized one points out. excuse that. still gives lot protection GOOD vaccine, like bs, that's all. Hopefully makes sense. want die hill saying restrictions lockdowns harmful minimum overreaction May 2020, that's choice. We're allowed opinions. take whatever vaccine can, you‚Äôre risk.

If you‚Äôre not, though, waiting see vaccine effective African strain good bet.

There study South Africa AZ 10% effective data rest vaccines. 

That strain currently Greece, Croatia likely Europe soon. even talking about? zero misinformation comment. you‚Äôd really like get technical - every country shut international travel second learned virus China. suggested second denied access China investigate. I‚Äôm sure would leg happened. I‚Äôm mot ignoring it. I‚Äôm pointing failure America unique countries size, wealth influence. Brexit irrelevant. suspect big box retailers like Walmart, Costco, etc follow Disney World's move require masks 2022 least. Florida low key free too. lot sites aren‚Äôt requiring medical documentation 18+. got oldest people vaccinated, requiring paperwork making strict criteria seems slow things down, especially supply comes in.  14% huge portion people getting hospitalized dying Covid. it‚Äôs 14%, knocks like 90%+ hospitalizations/deaths. Maybe go grocery store then? Copied article:

The EU conceded UK ban vaccine exports, Boris Johnson waded row Brussels publicly ‚Äúcorrecting‚Äù European council president claims British policy.

The prime minister told MPs Wednesday Charles Michel, council president former prime minister Belgium, wrong allege UK imposed prohibition vaccine exports.

Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe also proud support UK given international Covid response, including ¬£548m we‚Äôve donated Covax. I, therefore, wish correct suggestion European council president UK blocked vaccine exports. Let clear, blocked export single Covid-19 vaccine vaccine components.

‚ÄúThis pandemic put us side battle global health. oppose vaccine nationalism forms. trust sides house join rejecting suggestion call partners work together tackle pandemic.‚Äù

On Tuesday, Michel, chairs summits EU leaders helps direct policy, provoked angry reaction Whitehall stating newsletter UK ‚Äúimposed outright ban export vaccines vaccine components produced territory‚Äù.

When asked claims, Wednesday, European commission spokesman confirmed ban. declined comment directly claims made Michel.

‚ÄúWe know different countries got different measures place ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt concern vaccines, far understand, coming UK,‚Äù spokesman said.

Officials nevertheless pointed lack vaccine exports UK compared EU proof value European council president‚Äôs intervention. ‚ÄúWe need transparency that,‚Äù one said.

In contentious newsletter, Michel sought compare EU‚Äôs exporting record UK countries, including US, response suggestions bloc verging protectionism barring recent export vaccines Italy Australia.

Two weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen, president European commission, also suggested Britain US blocked export Covid-19 vaccines. EU seeking defend export authorisation mechanism ‚Äì forces companies secure approval ‚Äì accusations damaging vaccine supply chains.

The UK regulations stop profiteering medicines medical items masks impose ban vaccine components completed doses.

In sign testy state relations Michel‚Äôs claim British export ban Tuesday denounced foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, ‚Äúcompletely false‚Äù.

The EU‚Äôs ambassador Jo√£o Vale de Almeida summoned Foreign Office Brussels. Instead, EU‚Äôs charge d‚Äôaffaires London, Nicole Mannion, Irish deputy head Brussels delegation UK, received Wednesday morning Sir Philip Barton, permanent under-secretary Foreign Office. Barton understood conveyed government‚Äôs irritation claims.

A UK government spokesman said: ‚ÄúThis morning senior representative EU‚Äôs delegation UK summoned meeting [Barton] discuss issue incorrect assertions recent EU communications.‚Äù

Michel tweeted Tuesday night: ‚ÄúGlad UK reaction leads transparency increased exports EU [other] countries. Different ways imposing bans restrictions vaccines/medicines.‚Äù

EU officials declined comment Michel‚Äôs tweet.

While export ban authorisation scheme UK, government ensure vaccine doses produced Oxford/AstraZeneca sites Staffordshire Oxford directed first instance residents Britain. EU angered refusal Anglo-Swedish firm redirect doses light production shortfalls European facilities.

UK sources said government suffered supply shortfalls heavy experienced EU, AstraZeneca delivering third anticipated end first quarter 2021.

‚ÄúThe UK taxpayer paid development low-cost vaccine exported knowhow, not-for-profit basis, set manufacturing capability world,‚Äù source added, referring contract AstraZeneca.

Germany‚Äôs ambassador Britain, Andreas Michaelis, called end sparring EU UK. Michaelis, former head Germany‚Äôs diplomatic service, said relationship improve wake disputes vaccines Brexit withdrawal agreement. ‚ÄúIt continue like this,‚Äù tweeted. ‚ÄúWe important things do. Jointly!‚Äù arguing large chains haven‚Äôt put public newsletters announcing mandates? isn‚Äôt anecdotal, back claims evidence unlike dubious tales.  I've little confused this, officially we're phase 1a 1b starting 1c soon.

J&amp;J set Friday. We‚Äôre talking future, conditions true right now. Yup, family med!

 disappointing people prefer trust social media rather licensed professionals spent 8+ years academics (then 3+ years residency training), hey, that's world live in.

It certainly deterred offering shot educating best can, I've stopped pushing issue ""no"" I've found nothing say sway opinion matter.

Sadly, thing change peoples' minds loved one get sick COVID. Yea, think positive cutoff test either 37 40. either way difficult grow culture virus CT low 30s shouldnt infectious. important point. 75% effectiveness 15 days first shot. never got second shot, peak around 83% 35 days. Getting second shot 21 days gets \~95% effectiveness two weeks second shot. ""walk pharmacy first shot thinking magic shield"" someone else put it, two weeks later substantial immunity. public health experts advocating getting many people first shots possible rather holding back doses seconds, get herd immunity quicker. Yeah, absolutely, someone's anxiety keeping hunkered either vaccine (or making refuse vaccine, thereby keeping going indefinitely them), need several appointments therapist. I'm flippant, either. anxiety gotten point, \*nothing\* going help feel comfortable outside world beyond time therapy. watched press conference live yesterday, said would take 4-6 weeks current group opened they'd basically opened everyone. definitely making sort promise depends many vaccines get, expectation.

I can't find exact quote print 4-6 weeks: video here, I'm sure exact time stamp, want guess 15-45min mark (sorry I'm work can't narrow right now, MN want info think pretty good watch): ‚ÄúStop using anecdotal evidence!‚Äù

‚ÄúPublix stores Atlanta require masks must mean it‚Äôs normal anywhere all‚Äù And? Going big linked report, sampled dems Republicans. Looks part bigger political polling, probably accurate political polls been. article person thinks covid almost anyone US did, wants go long term disability. Okay.

Article cites study noting 30% covid infections symptoms 6 months infection. common? Fatigue.

I 100% accept covid long term effects, someone saying they're struggling concentrate, fatigued, anxious middle freaking global pandemic compelling evidence they've neurological debilitated. Even something like asking someone, ""is sense taste 100% back normal"" really hard quantify. Someone says ""I headaches used to."" dietary sleep habits gotten worse pandemic? 

I also think lot studies headlined like ""Long term symptoms 30% covid infections"" huge portion things like ""anxiety"" disappointingly trying hopeless narrative panic sells. Moderna 100% severe cases, Pfizer 95%, though

It doesn‚Äôt really matter, get choice... say ""361"" counts whole generation. Apart that, anecdotally, young people I've known who've died COVID family members friends people know Latin America. think there's probably something genetic still renders lot people indigenous blood vulnerable Old World diseases.  I‚Äôm pretty tired waiting. I‚Äôm science tiered rollout damn, ready get shot get back type normal. Interesting, thanks. That's exactly point. 2mil doses per day, That's 1mil people vaccinated. 1 million x 30 days 30 million, 60 million vaccinated 1 month. walk Publix Atlanta met mask mandate. still arguing like normal anywhere? Got first Pfizer dose last Friday. side effects whatsoever. don‚Äôt think single cause/a clear reason - people feeling weather? I‚Äôve read thread ‚Äúit‚Äôs sign strong reactive immune system‚Äù don‚Äôt disagree with. wouldn‚Äôt better response side effects? body takes vaccine manufactures copies spike protein antibodies without side effects? Yeah 2 week average data reported Monday Tuesday would first major spike snow cleanup. we‚Äôre 2 weeks past, numbers back makes vaccines available 16 older, becoming first state remove eligibility requirements 

Those younger 16 may see things differently. Yes, Earth small island. 

Let US stop misinformation denial now. in, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave yet! We‚Äôre waiting vaccine!‚Äù sure agree ""selfish."" every EU poster gleefully pointed past year... US covid situation complete shit-show. 

The US FAR highest case count country world, likewise FAR highest number deaths. matter slice it, US moment tremendous need vaccine. think selfish hardest hit nation world use vaccines. dress semantics like, remains export ban it‚Äôs paying cozy big pharma I'm gonna try get one maximum protection Yeah, wild guesstimate huge assumption lab results translate 1:1, meant taken serious attempt calculate efficacy SA variant.

Also ""29% reduction efficacy"" needs numbers context. Novavax's case, reduction 89% 60% huge that's decrease efficacy almost 4x (risk increases 11% 40% compared unvaccinated). Whereas reduction say 70% 40% would decrease 2x (30% 60%). SA trials proven incredibly fallable included younger participants. AZ believe prevents 100% severe cases SA Germany 3.1%! second highest among countries +20million people. Almonds DOUBLE compared UK! dworld universal, think florida restrictions *does* resist vaccine immunity, everyone's tests consistent that. 

The mitigating factor double shot mRNA USA vaccine drive intended overkill know needed. lot room give becoming ineffective. likely still work better hoped beginning.

The vaccine appeared ineffective South Africa AstraZeneca, approved USA anyway. forget UK said donate spare doses, finish vaccinations, poorer parts world. UK ordered 400 million doses vaccines. Assuming adults 2 doses. That's ~300 million spare doses bud would literally taken 3 weeks last March society wasn‚Äôt filled egotistical morons.

There absolutely truth this. Herd immunity either vaccine mass infections way ever going end. people test positive months infected. would spread virus 3 week lockdown. lives stereotype, that‚Äôs sure. wondering really sneezing contest there... Yay! Wonderful news! Keep up! look graphs cases/hospitalizations mostly young unvaccinated, numbers dropping steadily among fully vaccinated 60+. Israel also reduced restrictions opened economy past month, may slowed decline cases. confuse things further, also increased testing past month, 5-6k/100k population 7k/100k. opinion :) Morocco offered Sinopharm conduct clinical trials approved vaccine. Also early agreement Astrazeneca since one top scientists/executives moroccan origines. national ID system also facilitated vaccination process, send text message eligible receive date time vaccination. Also Morocco opted two vaccines since they're less logistically challenging manage. ""could be"" always multiple possibilities aren't

so 50% drop sufficient considering 50% vaccination? 

texas going texas matter anyone else says does. note dramatic decline hospitalizations among age got early vaccines Doubt UK received 9m doses EU according last news.

Lipids Pfizer made Canada actually. happen? worker speaks powder, lots large saliva droplets land it. shown contain 1000 infectious doses per droplet. Lab results showed weeks survival infectious virus room temperature high protein content, probably China better data saturated fat well.

The question wether large conversion factor outside aerosol inhalation food throat chewing aerosol infection.
It's certainly plausible, one made decent tracing experiments public nail down. Spoken like someone doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about. know quite 30 somethings Texas got vaccinations surplus needed used snows. haven‚Äôt commenting tell personally, I‚Äôm done them.

Time testing wasn‚Äôt concern either virus spreads easily able track success differentiate vaccinated group control group. take Oxfords IP rights back too? 

And vaccine components, currently export EU's Pfizer factories? 

I think EU would way upset actually created ban claim have. Unless Palestinian living Israeli occupation. Kind odd calculate Israel's vaccinated % everyone lives Israeli control. Worse that. DeSantis actually made illegal local municipalities institute stringent Covid measures like mask wearing. way... Lol go people stuck dryer government step bro? NYT take case/death data front page site mobile? killed chickens perdue farms years, waste kill room evisceration, get pumped drain fast moving water that's filtered tanker farm, sold dog food plant. 

Don't ever eat again. There's chickens come trucks that's dead they're purple. Ugh. 'There ban ban'.

Sounds right me. However much EU shills try obfuscate. Even sinovac? least Florida state made local government punish people wearing mask. essentially it‚Äôs honor system obviously doesn‚Äôt work. 

And can‚Äôt agree mask work? Make people wear mask we‚Äôll get less fatalities rly hate whole trolley problem game they‚Äôre playing rolling vaccines, test poo different counties roll based areas highest cases. they‚Äôre trying make value judgements deserves vaccine first, course people gonna feel left  should. governor Texas stupid trying require mask state. need knowing fucking coronavirus still going available evidence shows wrong. Either sort underlying reason anti-mask (usually it‚Äôs political affiliation, don‚Äôt know particular malfunction happens be) you‚Äôre failing grade school-level scientific thinking. Probably former. 

‚ÄúWe refused lock down!‚Äù evidence lockdowns don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs evidence don‚Äôt don‚Äôt give shit fellow man. OP mostly posts Serbia picking data suit agenda. know lot younger essential workers‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîwho recently gotten it. know healthy young randos gotten it, would qualify. despite, exactly point order. Stop politicizing virus.  know plenty people latch positive story hold dear life. much easier pessimist pleasantly surprised. Death penalty prisoners  ICU AZ COVID. close calls, improved got discharged. way out, nurse desk area asked was. COVID patient... said yes, dialed number went ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got COVID patient going home!‚Äù music starts playing ‚ÄúHere Comes Sun‚Äù speakers.

Apparently didn‚Äôt get many COVID patients make it, someone beats it, it‚Äôs still novel thing. don‚Äôt get emotional much one hit hard.

HCWs AZ probably much PTSD patients, tbh. Except everyone tried villainize groups workers like Teachers. Several Mayors Governors called teachers unethical wanting safe face-to-face working environments vaccines. Absolutely berated them. Parents enter board meetings districts go teachers lives important lives kids. abuse hurled verbally right absolutely unreal. Prosecuting people ""line jumping"" would give abusers ammunition actually start screwing teachers lives tangible ways expecting get sick possibly die daycare.

... try say essential..... yea, forced us back face face southern states (which right strike) little proper precautions safety measures. Teachers, parents, students catching dying Covid left right. mean, I'm vaccinated, probably get whatever COVID vaccine offered barring catastrophe coming months, lot companies developed vaccines shady things happen pasts, vaccines *were* developed quickly. course, could mean nothing, people called 'anti-vaxxers' questioning beginning put bodies ridiculous. onus scientists tell us prove us safe, seems far likely have, average people blindly accept it.

All said, idk Berenson lol.  That's exactly right. COVIDVu study, participants randomly selected U.S. Postal Service database sent invitations provide samples. 4,600 people completed surveys returned samples central laboratory mail. Happy vaccinated! Hopefully one day UK open again. I'm literally vaccinated can't shit still ü•≤ Chicken pate. best fear that's pretty accurate explanation sides yeah. Moderna track meet delivery requirements, unlike AZ Vaccines get ordered countries, get ordered companies. Loads countries ordered AZ vaccines AZ would use UK production plants fulfil orders allowed to. seems, isn't.

AZ fact put UK production facilities EU contract part primary production line EU. Crazy different things us. Texas fully vaccinated everything wide open booming. Truthfully wide open booming months here. 4 million doses extra March means already producing almost 10% estimated. Pfizer/Biontech blessing EU! Americans fetishisize companies much?

This undoubtably increase spread, sacrifice front line workers thread people defending billion dollar company like deadbeat dad. kind dog food? Also wondering it‚Äôs particularly relevant they‚Äôve second dose not. know vast majority protection given first dose minor increase given second dose. 

Much important look first doses. Better 50% population vaccinated partially 25% done fully. Shorthand brother None, already ""voluntary export ban"" thanks agreements AstraZeneca (first 100m doses produced Britain stay Britain). Grapperhaus saying 'people getting used curfew' devilish. people put lying? Curfew, first thing go! Yeah right. Lol, okay, take saying people call bear. That's crazy.

Technically, suppose, Texas modification Spanish word modification Cado word. guess got point. butcher everything. get started Manchaca.

Even though live different condos,  one cousin got infected going karaoke drunk. Prior diagnosed, infected sister husband, positive.

And far COVID stats - they're taken project personally built using USA University source data. 'gullible' China stats, well... I'm sure aware, China authoritarian state lot international travel outside HK. pretty confident would able minimize contain virus much efficiently almost country world. think higher numbers reported? Probably, fucking cares? 

And agree, able choose what's best us - reality FUCKTON stupid people need guidance (aka government) - without it, we'd fucked.

So vaccinated person needing mask? WTF talking about? flinging new arguments never mentioned reason address. Moderna same, looks promising. Meanwhile country registering 70+ open 60+ next month. Sad write article 'actually great'. vaccines great! might advantages disadvantages people compare, avoided like comparing apples oranges. Anyone know people fight good news? I‚Äôve seeing people genuinely don‚Äôt think things improving spring break surge way Texas going absolutely collapse since removing mandate...like calm deaths finally falling second wave... back almost 400 day. :( interesting see works UK. Secondary school pupils (age 11-19) staff currently tested twice week rapid tests. went back Monday. Moderna actually wants increase 5 10 actually increasing product. quite thing. in: Joe Rogan announces move South Dakota. mispronounced long, conviction, go ahead officially change spelling Bear County.  Brazilian here. P.1 variant infectious, also far fatal. older 60 longer much factor, half intubated people less 60. Reinfections also real, thing herd immunity.

Maryland's tiers confusing can't assed figure tier I'm I'll get goes gen-pop.

Or fly Alaska. give idea big impact vaccination program have: Norway averaged 7 deaths per day beginning January, 1, vaccinating nursing home 85+. fully expect covid around long time vaccination turn covid whole different animal. anecdotal advice may help others states still giving vaccine specific groups people:

I currently living TX major city even eligible nearly impossible time getting well deserved doses, (whether lack availability poor management, sure) heard many people area meet requirements gotten first shots. Texas reopens dining 100% capacity removed mask mandate, many coworkers service industry friends left looking way get vaccine safely continue work left fend health safety. 

 little help friend, boyfriend able schedule appointment days checking back various websites availability. offered waiting lists asked eligible provide proof upon arrival appointment secured. However, available appointments opened (mind you, drove 2 hours away get there, something able get locally city) able schedule receive first shot questions asked, proof necessary. 

I advised mother lives another state (CT) same; check back every website find offering appointments wait something pop up, grab first available appointment soon can. available appointments, available vaccines, questions asked whether meet requirements upon scheduling, see would waste time refusing service vaccine could potentially go unused reason. 

Obviously places strict following guidelines, giving vaccine meet requirements, etc. completely impossible others find way get line well. So, fellow service industry, grocery store employees, ""essential"" workers put front lines keep country running making ever stagnant minimum wages, stop *looking* appointment; least chance finding one allow get shot regardless age health profession. available vaccine available vaccine, best *used* rather wasted enough eligible parties scheduled spots. Try CVS? ask intake form second shot. Asians, Africans, Oceanians fought virus. North Americans South Americans Europeans fought other. stay home. ones forcing attend events. Let adults make decisions. Tway1998 reliable source either apparently... Yup, sorry ‚Äúexperts‚Äù i‚Äôm shutting life going back nightmare masks restrictions 3 months+ every year.

In theory already electronic covid passport. question whether masks effective, whether mask *mandates* effective. States strict mandates basically states little/no mask enforcement. It‚Äôs like comparing drinking half cup bleach full cup. Bleach bleach.

Vaccines offsetting them. Seeing Alaska 48/50 least population, surprising. I‚Äôve said people acting like ending statewide mask mandate Texas end world? anyone wearing mask unenforced mandate? people talk people still wear masks, that‚Äôs fine. basically proves don‚Äôt need statewide mandates. It‚Äôs like Florida isn‚Äôt fine right now. I'm sure Abbott agrees considering lives there.

He can't say anything else absolutely one call hypocrisy, nonsense, complete disregard constituency. Don‚Äôt really understand point trying make here. 

Taking US example, think would rigid response foreign state terrorist group executing 1-3000 people day? 

Who assholes say right congregate shop without mask important lives elderly, risk? 

Or know, maybe realizing viruses mutate, every regulation relaxed puts us risk new strain wipes vaccine progress? UK South Africa strain already merged, there‚Äôs that, it‚Äôs believed become dominant strain, given contagious vaccine resistant (the vaccines still effective less so) 

So yeah, people thinking can‚Äôt handle little personal sacrifice save lives assholes.

Getting vaccination seems like luck right place right time. ""have fun"" covered rights like life, liberty pursuit happiness.  Way miss point.

""Which one us right""? think arguing would happen? wasn't. trying explain segmenting under-50s two groups would beneficial.

As far know, plan live open everyone they're done 65+, essential workers, preexisting conditions.

And think timeline probably right, based fast vaccine production ramping up. 1.5 people per state, per second. average state 350 Walgreens CVS stores. (There ~19,000 total US). stores vaccinates 2 people every 5 minutes, would come 2 people per state, per second, need.

Now, rate little high (but given literally highest national priority, could achievable), count pharmacies, hospitals, clinics.

There absolutely reason achievable, need continue hold government's feet fire make sure happens (though trend right looks good). know got care health society others said carrying card archaic. Everything moving digital. going vaccination passport, going paper too? Many venues, sporting events, mass gatherings going require proof vaccination. everyone going show paper card? going CR code scanned linked together.

Also, lot transmission probably happening people visit go back wherever came from. keep saying vaccines coming, vaccines seem come... I‚Äôm sure point is. data hardly ever speaks itself. Data without context meaningless. case, Texas shut weeks due storm, likely decreased cases/decreased testing. increase cases could due increased testing state repoened, fact decreased otherwise would storm, potentially due decreased mask wearing (although new mask rules went place today). company little way essential workers allowing us take half day paid get vaccine well reimbursements needed. think companies consider order make easier option get shots arms.

Life coming back!  matter contracts violated, EU said block vaccines countries that. Astrazeneca EU state company, EUs place determine every single vial produce goes, especially they've told world would that. countries like UK didnt ban exports, sign contracts local producers stating first preference. export ban via back door. Pfizer isn‚Äôt time ALL. decency / enough logistics expertise figure give heads lower-than-promised deliveries (a weeks upfront). promise make starting April onwards. We‚Äôll see goes. no, single vaccine (I‚Äôm following Pfizer, moderna, AstraZeneca) supplied quantities planned/promised in. Ugh, Georgian seriously everyone know qualifies recieve obese. hope moves quickly. I, like everyone sure, sick home. thats really thing though?  blocking shipments outside country AZ meant delivery timelines obligated to.  

Phizer meeting deadlines US delivering faster. SO.. same. US blocked vaccines leaving US even though contractual obligations met. Walgreens puts new appointments 6am every day access them. yes, 300 years ago 15% babies died birth 0.3%

isnt great indicator? Vaccines COVAX represent less 1% vaccines needed inoculate every Canadian. vaccines shared every Canadian inoculated. 

You pretend Canada benevolent generous something, Canada's Minister Procurement Anand clearly stated Canada share *any vaccines Canadians inoculated*.

So congrats actually exact thing Canadians accusing US doing. sure say still supply issue. think time start getting tier folks open. far know (state hasn‚Äôt given good guidance) people eligible get vax doctor, go public site. really limiting tier. wouldn‚Äôt surprised said 50-64 start Monday too. weeks numbers unacceptable based many doses we‚Äôve gotten. satisfied, inconsistencies irregularities people happy about.

Within couple months groups vaccinated. worst pandemic countries behind us, vaccination productions around world gradually accelerate, things turn better quickly rather slowly. can't say whether I've ever asymptomatically infected someone flu, exercise common sense precautions make sure everything possibly infect someone flu. 

Now, COVID (a) much deadlier flu, (b) much likely spread asymptomatically. pretty settled science now. So, much likely accidentally infect someone COVID infect someone flu. reasonable risk-mitigation strategy avoiding superspreader events altogether.

California really enforced restrictions. Outside Bay area LA county locals refused enforce restrictions. gyms restaurants open indoor dining months mask required. Nothing happens them. Chinese one? No, EUA would revoked treatment question proven effective somehow harmful safety wise. theory vaccines EUA forever, reality phase 4 trials end couple years, FDA likely grant full approval, unless better safer treatment becomes available They're cutting quarantine half. That's smart move point time. things go well 7 day quarantine I'm sure cut back even further. remindme! 24 hours I‚Äôve seen people Twitter yelling people using mental health ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù lift restrictions - posts recent suicides. It‚Äôs ridiculous.  best part Austin state capitol dont go far scream other. anyone smarter theories vaccine administration exploded thus far March way anticipated? We're sitting 30 million difference vaccines distributed vs. vaccines administered citizens. overestimate capacity administer? 2 million per day ceiling we're capable of, logistically? AstraZeneca similar situation. Anyway, know US people who'd delighted vaccinated ""in 3 weeks"". lol Yes, course actually 100%, I'm repeating trial data said. fact close enough 100% single hospitalization show trial (or trial approved vaccines) enough. try healthcare provider counties website? That‚Äôs found available appointments. Weekend data dump. worries, said wrong thing totally get misunderstanding. I‚Äôm much side ‚Äúkeep masks save lives please‚Äù Oh! apologies misunderstanding. entire last month Texas crazy. Sorry hear right place J&amp;J distributed within US comment regards there. Texas ""home rule""? state IL, larger metro areas ""home rule"" provisions permit local management things like, say, pandemic, long less restrictive statewide management things, explains live regulations stricter state, businesses getting fined breaking them, yet 50 miles away completely different story. Distribution ready patients likely different things. Hospitals get them, need goto clinics, appointments made, administration.

So us generally lag administration distribution get first dose Friday! Can‚Äôt wait!! Look, ""100% hospitalization death"". myth created fact interim results trials *have* enough COVID cases vaccine arm (good!) meaningfully determine percentage would end hospital grave.

Of course, still effective, making kind flawed argument helping anyone, especially every time new ""oh no, outbreak nursing home, including people vaccinated!"" headline (there one now). make people think vaccine 100% effective hospitalization death, they'll think stopped working. great idea.

Let's take *big* study, data actual populations taken vaccine... [The Israel, country vaccinated highest percentage population (mostly fully Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), published New England Journal follow-up period starting 7 days second dose, vaccine effectiveness documented infections, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, severe disease 92% (95% CI, 88 95), 94% (95% CI, 87 98), 87% (95% CI, 55 100), 92% (95% CI, 75 100), respectively.

The follow-up 7 days second dose considered ""final"" one. see good, high values, 100%. means people got vaccine died, people hospitalized. Seldom anything ""100%"".

If numbers J&amp;J different, makes difference. places don‚Äôt consider cigar smokers smokers. Sure, could lie say qualify that‚Äôs roll. I‚Äôd gladly take unused dose used else destroyed. I‚Äôm jump ahead actually qualify since it‚Äôs easier hit ps5 get appointment pa Umm case numbers high today compared 2 days ago? don‚Äôt disagree. Considering one died trials hospitalized - wouldn‚Äôt call markedly different. J&amp;J created product cheaper, easier distribute, easier store maintaining efficacy required FDA granted emergency approval. huge win.  experts tell us science tells it‚Äôs time. land plane? pilot says to.

Edit: I‚Äôll add imo, believe 50% population full vaccinated least. We‚Äôre currently 6% ‚ÄúI altering name. Pray alter further.‚Äù I'm Michigan, got first Pfizer shot. 50+ underlying conditions hypertension allowed get one. think would get months, hang there, get one sooner think. Chicago planning use sport stadiums mass vaccination sites future yet every number far points Pfizer Moderna superior vaccine design. Remember, blinded studies compare efficacy control group - rates COVID transfer community already factored percentages.

New data always emerge changes scientific understanding, happens, substantial evidence favor mRNA vaccines effective based know far. 

All vaccines serve place vaccination program long supply constrained, single dose vaccine advantages convinces otherwise-hesitant people opt vaccine. goal get highest protection available, mRNA vaccines currently far away best bet. You‚Äôre delusional. stop? Sorry, misspoke. didn‚Äôt mean governor. meant Escott Austin City Council. agree everything you‚Äôve said. That‚Äôs good reason... Plus near impossible escape crappy jobs, Netanyahu ‚Äúmeant‚Äù saying pandemic behind exactly nothing. It‚Äôs bullshit political posturing

Alex Jones Austin forever fuck face. Tell Lake Highlands Highland Park  here, shift scheduled second doses day leftovers. booked next week hopefully I'll better luck. plus side, job entailed wheeling excited older folks around, half bad anyway! test antibodies, antibodies vaccinated? takes least three weeks fully vaccinate someone?

Until now, least 6 weeks. J&amp;Js brings bit, that's new. anyone surprised this?

There mask ban Texas.

Remove mask mandate state, every town needs it, cities want mandate still keep it...

Additionally, businesses schools still require mask choose. 

Kinda proof state-wide mandate needed, right? guarantee Oxford candidate would succeed either. better chance, yes, balanced vs potential profit. would recommend getting one greater supply. really respect wanting take vaccine someone needs more, it‚Äôll definitely useful later on.  vote Dallas agree you, think language smart case. 

People vaccinated feel like magic shields applied moment walk pharmacy. reminder long takes reach full efficacy...however poorly worded...is critical. casual readers mass-market news publications going take time appreciate nuance. don‚Äôt now. get test land right airport, charge. excess supply sitting around. distributed 7M vaccines yesterday, gave 1.6M shots.  get that, thought I'd heard Moderna 'fully effective' 14 days 2nd shot Pfizer 7 I'm assuming reference FL Governor Ron DeSantis? yeah, that's exactly he's doing. wear them, I'm done. actually scheduled anyone told people get scheduled (common sense really) got scheduled day. key word last post must triggered auto-mod? basically reddit processes popular trending posts thus makes visible people. reasons hard say, verifiable proof essential worker needed get vaccine.

This kind wondering about. know people lied healthcare worker wondering could ever come back bite (like make note vaccinated false occupation). seem like it. Masks public.
Maskless around vaccinated people/people w low risks (most private settings).

Well reason US many vaccines. Pfizer, JnJ Moderna US owned companies. Biontech part reason US many vaccines, reason. 

The US pays exorbitantly drugs rest world, contributing factor. ""logical"" approach. sometimes real-life work exactly would predict. Hence I'm curious see things work places rapidly went tier system free-for-all. Like Israel Alaska. also tested 20% US lower confirmed case per capita US also play decreases herd immunity discussions Duh piece cloth protect people someone vaccine carrier.

You're making mountain molehill ZERO percent hospitalization rate tested positive Covid took Fluvoxamine rollout phases seems logical fair (especially 65+ population) come drawbacks. tough manage demand areas going demand others.

It literally exist scientifically proven medical condition. vast majority 'long haulers' never test positive COVID antibodies...ever.

It's entirely psychosomatic. Could talking percentage eligible population. 16 elegible, really need anyway. Seriously, thru entire ordeal many, many people refused wear mask without consequence. saw tons requests employees customers flat refused walked right by. never ""mandate"" anywhere Stop framing uniquely American problem. look figures COVID vaccine hesitancy, US average attitudes towards shot, numbers people willing get vaccine keep growing every new poll. DM source (cos subreddit let post it.) 79m allocated. 2 weeks allocation left March (22nd, 29th). Assuming numbers puts 92.316m. 

Short 100m said **BUT** assume delay CDC allocates moderna says ready. 

If assume 1 week lag time, would go April 5th allocation date cover everything moderna ready. add another week - 6.6m, right around 99-100m (I rounding Im sure Moderna going say 100m 99.2m).

So actually looks like right numbers - much delay getting doses Moderna states believe people realized (myself included) That's problem DeSantis handling this.

Avoid topic political comments. USA ban exports

false I‚Äôm pretty sure theory urban legend. Never heard infectious disease expert say anything like that. heard lots Redditors claiming though. seem base idea assumption disease deadlier kills host fast spread. therefore mutate less deadly variants. 

The problem is, doesn‚Äôt work pre-symptomatic spread. virus spread effectively even feel ill, it‚Äôs lethality isn‚Äôt factor. 

There many viruses deadly ever were. forget Europeans internet unhealthy obsession proving place live better USA Eh, I'd like comparisons across countries. Tennessee's 1C covers sorts conditions, shortage elgible people. 

Obesity probably 35% state now, hypertension another massive block. Living pregnant person one seen many places.

It might take bit people realize 1c since expansive. Thank you! article absolutely **nothing** vaccine. **completely irrelevant** discussion here. I'll repeat two questions I've asked simple yes refuse answer.

* think vaccine safe?
* think vaccine prevent suffering save lives? Yeah, states good roll vaccine. state, governor started allow pharmacies give Vaccine shots. travel two hours city get first shot, get second shot. decided prioritize rural areas urban ones, wasn‚Äôt much demand rural areas. starting wake hold enough mass vaccination events urban areas appointments don‚Äôt instantaneously vanish.

Riedell-Mendez said 95-year-old mother, Francine Riedell, received second dose Pfizer vaccine Jan. 28. said got call March 1 nursing home telling mother tested positive. said mother collapsed Sunday hospitalized. Yup. We‚Äôve lost minds extent Americans have. Shame. Avoid topic political comments. Wow, sounds awful! glad made okay! Thank information, maybe take ibuprofen, and, like said, work next day, ok. small concerned genitalia spread misinformation. Agreed. referring total geographic land area. It‚Äôs spread large cities.

Weird feeling gotten since moving 2010. posh part dallas near Frisco north Fort Worth seems rich suburbs everyone commutes Dallas from. Plenty job openings Dallas right profession I'm struggling find anything close Keller. getting downvoted, generally truth.  conversation become much Pfizer plant Belgium has/or basically expropriated EU opposed private company facility is.

But EU ability keep Pfizer exporting products, chosen to, likely due diplomatic reasons longer term considerations investment. would think we'd see allocations really ramp soon.

On February 23, companies said projected [a combined 140 million federal government March 31.

Since date, federal government 25,564,500 Pfizer doses 20,298,200 Moderna doses, combined 45,862,700. That's weeks 3/1, 3/8 3/15. add week 2/22, 59,362,740.

If that's true, we're somewhere neighborhood 80-90M doses short expected we'd end March. However, I'm sure includes federal pharmacy program allocations doses specifically LTC, could change math slightly. important note doses allocated feds exactly mean doses delivered feds.

But still, feels like things pretty far behind might've expected point. Unless we're sitting absolute tsunami doses, hard see we're anywhere close projections end March. end already bout enough vaccine vaccinate everyone People sub still spreading ""Yes still need mask vaccine otherwise spreading virus could kill someone"" nonsense. can't say like child expect right Ohio Phase 2 (60+, teachers, public service workers, pregnant women, etc)

Looking forward 45+/widespread vaccines picky! somebody explain Biontech/Pfizer suddenly, signing papers throwing huge wads money around, deliver 4 million extra dosis matter weeks? thought production main problem, 4 million come from? rest world getting less vaccines coming weeks what? Sorry I‚Äôm stuck hours traffic harassed multiple homeless people feel like ‚Äútown‚Äù. Austin anywhere close feeling like town lol Pfizer. Saving europeans ways one! Seventeen residents Brenham nursing home contracted coronavirus either partially fully vaccinated virus inoculation created prevent people developing severe Officials Focused Care Brenham said Tuesday nine 17 residents tested positive COVID-19 fully vaccinated, remaining eight received first two doses.

I‚Äôm board getting vaccine feel safe ending pandemic shouldn‚Äôt shamed blind faith ‚Äúthe science‚Äù knowing past actions companies even certain governmental agencies. It‚Äôs personal belief informed public questioning methods data behind ‚Äúthe science‚Äù hold pharmaceutical companies governmental agencies accountable ensure safety all. people Vietnam, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, elsewhere known we're assholes quite years now.

Less people getting hospitalized. patients getting better treatment soon, end month almost supply vaccine. see people negative, that's me.... think retooling Sanofi plant.  think poster referring long term investment Pharma industry inside EU, Covid vaccines.

And that's obviously key consideration.  Pfizer invested Belgium plant plans global workhorse.  EU interfering plans reaffirm Pfizer's decision make confident future investments.  EU steps stops Pfizer able fullfill contracts countries export ban, Pfizer Pharma companies well may divert future investment elsewhere. still deadly transmitted showing symptoms.
People say virus mutates mild one speculation. Yet another example tell people ‚ÄúAustin oasis normalcy, amongst sea Texas.‚Äù $1.9 trillion covid stimulus, can't find money build wall across 150 miles across northern Florida, physically separate asylum rest country? surprising Texas many deaths past months. spread misinformation.

Also comparing tuberculosis coronavirus asinine. TB lay dormant entire life, treated antibiotics. screen everyone coming infected area. make video every day take antibiotics. almost cases every year strict policy. go TB ward around active TB infections, bet ass everyone wearing mask. Cases may uptick slightly it‚Äôs virtually impossible surge like we‚Äôve seen past given many people covid vaccines point vaccine strengthen immune response catch it, body know defend it. That's literally like definition vaccine, I'd strongly suggest inform spreading disinformation ignorant presumptuous safety dismissal. true vaccines noted significantly reduce transmission important observe word *reduce*, eliminate entirely, yet, still transmitted, stay safe really clear. Otherwise, people like you, far jumpy toss masks stop washing hands pretend like life gone back normal lack patience keep shit spreading stay quarantine mask usage even longer, because, turns out, dont actually *contract* virus spread it, shake two peoples hands, rocket science, despite lot people try make as. Also keep mind CFR(case fatality ratio) 3%, includes early cases treatments killed people.

The IFR (Infection fatality ratio) much lower, impossible tell. Since extra people would never tested positive. walked dog without mask today. Granted, people maintain 16-20 feet distance us anyway him, felt weird guilty, constant thought back head wondering still wear mask!

Pic related: think terminology wording step means. 

For example, CDC vaccine counter, use ""delivered"". assume thats different meaning link, uses allocated. 

So question is, allocated doses become delivered doses? example, March 8th allocations delivered week? March 1st March 15th doses?

If assume March 8th, would mean CDC doesnt vast majority doses delivered yet. moderna 60m delivered. would mean 3 full weeks, ~20m more, plus whatever left week. would put close 100m said. Yeah really unfortunate, live near rural southern city, there's often shortage appointments city. live Raleigh friends told basically impossible get vaccine without waking crack dawn incredible luck, wake late still find ~25 reservations nearby Greensboro. getting doses then? we‚Äôre going forget Super Bowl happened Hush now, getting way indignance. Hypothetically J&amp;J vaccine first/only vaccine, would probably universally joyful celebration path exit pandemic. 

Because that, LOL. US fortunate end sooner without waiting J&amp;J production fully ramp up, countries going successfully exit pandemic mostly thanks J&amp;J vaccine. Ah, makes sense. get give. Seems like better generating viral load.

So evolved separately become deadly infectious, evolved way increased symptoms increased transmission side effects. 51 direct cases that, Minnesota all. Try examine top posts posting yet another duplicate. Yes, days ago teachers still part priority group. He‚Äôs focused buttering seniors, reliable constituency him. mean, bad. would assume fall much bigger consider many folk already got one shot many already went virus (confirmed+unconfirmed). confusing keep hearing effective even one jab is. article: "" B117 variant believed cause serious illness variants""

From study published BMJ today: "" Infections new variant VOC-202012/1 (as measured gene negativity) associated increased risk death (P&lt;0.001) people testing positive covid-19 community. increased hazard ratio 1.32 2.04, higher variants, translates 32% 104% increased risk death, probable hazard ratio estimate 1.64, 64% increased risk death. "" ahead US states race vaccinate, daily positivity rate 2-3% range. I'm watching Israel wondering expect here, hopeful avoid third wave region, we've underestimated virus number times now. El Paso well. like official flair representing background, verification process. first sending mod mail. solves nothing. Titles editorialized period whether mods like not. Wow trolling International travel? can't even go enjoy drink late-ish snack 10/11 outside? Sure thing, whatever makes feel safe. I'll probably boat I'm vaccinated, going super weird unmasked public first times haha  article uses questionable assumptions good old fashion fear mongering. 

A small portion population really need wary virus. vast majority folks, media portrayed much deadly really is. civil. avoid spreading misinformation. Maybe next one comes along, within lifetimes prepared 1%. That's lot much % got one shot time? 7%? public transportation, schools city buildings. thought that. deaths nursing homes outrageous since vaccine given. Removing state mandate anti-life? Y‚Äôall realize like half south doesn‚Äôt state level mask mandate right? It‚Äôs Texas want [read rationale, good news. isolation we've put people almost inhumane. Except Covid killed many older voters - tend vote conservative.

Don't get carried away. HELL YEAH! guy born raised Texas til 17, I'm super happy Austin taking shit seriously. Keep weird Austin! neanderthal move, actually hated too: obviously that, probably love bit stopped back too. I'm thankful Joe getting podcasts, many better ones there. got sick hearing bs every cast They've started Houston. friend restaurant. Masks required restaurant. Someone entered without mask unnoticed. Another diner started screaming maskless diner friend. ""You're murderer! murder!""
Thanks Abbot. Thanks Trump. kind thought given. That's case states similar makeup. cities support rest state, rest state physically assault saying that. ~~unfortunately~~ fortunately legally can‚Äôt enforce penalties wearing masks. DeSantis signed executive order last year banning local municipalities enforcement right, statistically, difference. 8th December... businesses keeping mask mandates. cannot definitely say would dead schools closed either. Maybe. someone living one ""better"" states handling COVID (California), beaches, malls restaurants jam packed since summer 2020. mean like keep schools closed ostensibly fear COVID, go airplanes social distancing? much population living urban areas taking COVID seriously despite state level stupidity. Compare entirely rural states virus runs rampant small towns refuse wear masks. 


It's different Texas, States actually enforcing mask mandates small towns, point ratio urban rural. sucks cities actually trying, they're hurt similarly regardless state. I‚Äôm curious Texan cities keeping *their* mask mandate. clearly understand state America‚Äôs public school system day-to-day life school. 

I see 130 11-14 years olds small, well-ventilated room 8+ hours day without proper PPE masks, gloves, plexiglass shields, disinfectant state won‚Äôt fund school districts. 

Show job isn‚Äôt teaching similar circumstances ISN‚ÄôT virtual. isn‚Äôt one. 

I disagree loss life isn‚Äôt significant detrimental society student regression. educator understand child development. 

A majority teachers vaccinated understand. Show sources ‚Äúmajority‚Äù teachers vaccinated. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs less education personal freedoms general anonymity city life affords people makes cities liberal. Small towns resist change everyone knows one another tell person changed drastically. people city clue yesterday expectation tomorrow. 

Plenty educated assholes regressive types there. plenty uneducated liberal folks. Education plays part experiences open doors to, genuinely believe freedom express oneself change rapidly without communal judgement major driving force liberal nature large urban environments. unfortunately correct. also unfortunately, people traveling don‚Äôt give damn. care political opinions. Why? said research ignorant topics talks about. Yet talks them. makes (and viewers) dumb. Anecdotal, ok. Schools open months states without massive deaths hospitalizations teachers. hear you. I'm Indian frustrating see people community voting Trump avoiding people races stereotypes they've adopted. like like white people either. Ironically, that's think white people racist. Feels weird outlier group hard rationalize kind thinking like least try understand others' point view. things wrong. Exactly! business wants tell customers ""wear rag face diseased piece **** get store!"" completely free mandate.

Pure evil handjobs corporations. 2200. read Atlantic article today. seems people responding treatment, depending damage. everything, though, unfortunately. 

Here article, interested:

[The Atlantic: Unlocking mysteries long covid Joes meathead. Albeit curious one. opinions takes lot things reek blustering testosterone, poor thought process recently general detachment real world. defense latter half baked multi multi millionaire whose primary jobs reacting fights sharing opinions bound lose touch extent. US, 1.6M vaccines administered, 55.6k new cases (according worldometers). That's dumb statistic. Literally list biggest states population. 

Use cases per 100,000 residents transmission rates. Walgreens option schedule second dose. know schedule month advance (normally three days dose one scheduling dose two time) worth checking. long card assume fine.  definition ""severe covid"" necessarily involve actually going hospital. Yes. would rather students learning suffer temporarily lose life permanently. love students value students existence earth.

Tons people going work in-person throughout pandemic. Fucking McDonald‚Äôs workers have. 100% chance you‚Äôll die teach in-person? No? Well 100% chance kid‚Äôs stunted lifetime Sorry...not 2.7 million people ceased exist? ....ok

500,000 mostly older Americans dying depthless tragedy. long term effect students losing year learning going worse. Especially consider poor minority children suffer even ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù vaccinated country? state one largest federal allotments vaccines vaccinated 7% adult population 3 months teachers added list eligibility two days ago.

I referring majority teachers. don‚Äôt know live states equal shares vaccines per capita believe so, yes.

This answer happened didn‚Äôt Biden send request states expand eligibility?

What talking about?

The issues describing gone late January. talking December/early Jan opened eligibility opened vaccine sites, we‚Äôve gotten 1-2 million doses per day.

We rolling 7 day average 942k Jan 21st. right edge 1M.

I'm trying start Biden versus Trump fight here, I'm saying got serious re-write history going on. 


When still bloody hard elgible person get appointment, eligibility that's problem. do! Fair enough! appreciate that. Send Bill email need xbox. already shipping address. Fair enough. certain point always come actions words. 

It still bugs crap see it. Maybe think I‚Äôm safe confidant default. (I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm clear enough try.) California muh Texas! /s Yes, many teachers work district? Perspective important. Yep, potential benefit would come vaccinating 41 year old 35 year old would offer bottleneck causes getting vaccine.

We need get point walk pharmacy get vaccinated without appointment, like flu shot That‚Äôs Austin lame JT clearly said repeatedly adults want one offered one September.  Purposefully vague. turns supply may get us believe unless happened today dose Sept plan. Hopefully doesnt matter whose interpretation right. says 5.168% received ‚Äúat least one dose‚Äù. 

Some received one, received two.

If add Bloomberg‚Äôs numbers receiving exactly one dose (3.6%) fully vaccinated (two doses : 1.5%), get number!   aunt uncle fully vaccinated two weeks ago. 70s. cannot wait eat out. elder friends also getting there. mom soon too. relief real. would disagree doesn‚Äôt happen Houston, experience happens differently. many plant fires 2019, environmental groups began suspect Ken Paxton starting suing plants non-compliant facilities using Attorney General‚Äôs office (cases processed TCEQ, referred AG‚Äôs office certain cases). accelerating AG‚Äôs prosecution lenient return compliance actions (small penalties), Paxton‚Äôs office could prevent Harris County prosecutors suing stronger case stronger penalties. also re-directs settlement money state rather county, even though it‚Äôs populace Harris Co negatively affected events. Agreed - also feel general practitioners also able get hands vaccines administer patients.

I imagine large influxes people lining mega hubs would diminish significantly people would get vaccinated private avenues opened means get inoculated. fully vaccinated lol. I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù New York. fact even waitlist could sign shows Wisconsin ahead game, that‚Äôs likely one reasons they‚Äôve able hit high utilization.

If states similar usage rate, could vaccinated tens millions people now. Party small government*

*some exceptions apply  Two staff members 10 residents tested positive Cottonwoods long-term care facility Kelowna, 221 publicly funded beds. Henry said staff residents home offered immunizations high uptake vaccine. said cases among people received two doses vaccine.

This bottom line: vaccinated people (with low probability) become infected. almost certainly mild symptoms. what's key is: *they likely still pass infection others* - example, UNvaccinated people *could* severe fatal symptoms.

AFAIK, official CDC statement (vaccinated person transmitting virus) possible, certainly seems like could happen. Xbox vaccinated üò≠ Nope, taken Federal Government's website. See number top right: Uh oh Texas already showing signs California Yes one fully vaccinated. 2 dose need one ones need it. September Wyoming could vaccinated... could find 37 people. think different experiences. I've lived Houston Austin well smaller rural towns. can't tell kinds people talking behind back, put much value kinds thoughts - there's probably single person said something racist/sexist/discriminatory behind another's back. long actions behavior way, thoughts welcome. interactions people, secret thoughts going affect me. I'm building kind relationship them, kind stuff going come sooner later. It‚Äôs 6 hours since shot feel okay guess?

I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs better. wish family safety this. I‚Äôm proud Wisconsin type system leading country 92% usage last time looked yesterday. healthy 30 year old, I‚Äôm even signed wait list case dose becomes available would otherwise go waste. TLDR Wow really.

(Technically, I‚Äôm still study, BTW. They‚Äôre still following placebo recipients get vaccinated vaccines.) anyone know time Tom Thumb/Albertsons opens appointments? school district person since August.

Four teachers died.

Many gotten terribly sick gone hospital. One particular vent month able teach another year. Agreed, takes scientific expert read, interpret, evaluate, integrate scientific findings regardless published. 

Additionally, ‚Äúpredatory journals‚Äù publish anything, however Scientific Reports fall category. Imo, vaccine hesitant people last priority. 

If someone chooses get vaccine they‚Äôre eligible for, becomes conscious decision.

We shouldn‚Äôt hold vaccines everyone else wait convince stragglers refuse get vaccine.  county leased old department store space mass vaccination site.

I realized going massive early February, frankly evidence getting China, appeared like would worse death rate ended having, know much lesser affects young people. made wager wife ""china flu"" used call then, would go school history books. I'm still sure win yeah. body count = news  They'll still move even steady watching shot go would thought get shot all... Felt like light touch fingertip. live Germany, wife retired doctor. Funny post gets deleted stays on. guess rules everyone one playing game - would say willing face 0.012% chance death rather take experimental vaccine approved FDA, rather given emergency authorization following rushed development

That kind messaging intended scare persuade people. Here's another quote since 1989 pharmaceuticals indemnified damages. Hence push new vaccines. compare vaccines prior modern creations apples apples.

You're trying scare people away taking vaccine kind messaging. since answer assume think vaccine harmful evidence showing is, meaning safe take save lives prevent suffering. Despite knowing facts refuse take unknown personal reasons. No! Go Mexico! good tacos /s What‚Äôs line though, considering longer children infants able receive it? Cmon covid, US Hungary cases /s Blank doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt report. Mississippi reported 0 deaths official report yesterday. See here: doesn‚Äôt mean 16 reported 0, differentiate non-reports zero. REMOVED MISINFORMATION I‚Äôm sad say since it‚Äôs endemic don‚Äôt think would happen. People still die flu. March 12 distracted work afternoon felt like world ending. company sent mass email day saying starting following Monday, anyone could would required work home. (Most company small group employees still come in.) back since knows if/when will. Give couple weeks. Vaccine supply way strange rule. Titles leave context time sometimes differ markedly what‚Äôs stated article. 

As were, OP. üëç thinking thing. work becomes moot fairly quickly keep good pace vaccinations Aw, sucks. would hate breathe mouth - colds annoying restrict breathing nose. Sorry sounded rude. issue patient‚Äôs health, would someone medically unable vaccinated treated differently? pose exactly risk patients. Lol know seems like oxymoron, get one.

It‚Äôs true hate needles. felt like fool barely felt anything. even squeeze nurses hand unnecessarilyüòî  Nice. know lot folks that!

Side note - I've long Tricare even thing :) It‚Äôs horrible analogy perfectly correct Correct, YANAL. ""restriction"" means context. read EO (which know quickly responded) figured already. get hopes up. new variants, vaccines become useless we'll back square one again. That's highly misleading.

Disney's fiscal year ends September. company growing revenue (55B, 59B, 69B) dropped 65B 2020, almost half year 65B pre-pandemic, impact pandemic much apparent 2021 fiscal reporting.

Net Income went 11B 2019 -2.8B 2020, though bigger impact pandemic 2021 reporting.

Disney big corporation, also 59B debt. new subscription service future theater release revenue highly dependent production shut projects well delayed made far expensive others.

Now certainly, none suggest Disney finance 1B-2B losses they're already expecting order pay employees working, but... unemployment insurance for?

Is expectation employers? Disney others, what's criteria determining employer pay employees there's work do?

From page executive order shall supercede conflicting order issued local officials response COVID-19 disaster, **but extent local order restricts services allowed executive order allows gatherings restricted executive order.**

Mask mandates restrict services. simply mean wear mask receiving services. That‚Äôs incredibly low bar March 8th Indian Wells tennis tournament got cancelled. WA sin shock, big tournament. believe Sunday. remember watching news stock market crashing Monday.

I actually preparing complete crash market. work real estate. total opposite happened. Go figure... helping themselfs first, that's reason build many can't say they'll help others, want make big provit selling them. like said look Israel, bought vaccines gave theor enemys, Palestinians. american way far away others do. let put way - SF closer NYC, rural South Dakota. yet many rural areas far, far worse (more NYC-like) rates SF. 

And note San Francisco busiest bus line country (38 Geary), swells many times population work day. ""Trump presidential library"" lol  Yes US ended pledging donate huge amount Trumpelstiltskin got boot. However, refusing help countries actual vaccine counterproductive. quicker world whole achieves herd immunity, better be. Vaccinating entirety US spreads mutates like wildfire, possibly creating mutations render vaccine less useful great. 

I recognize ideal answer here. frustrates hear people saying ‚Äúwho cares rest world long Americans get vaccinations...‚Äù wonder Mississippi getting many. sign online Kroger Walgreens get shot tomorrow. signed last night rolled morning local grocery store got shot along groceries. I'll never forget Facebook post high school friend died suddenly. twenties healthy, died overnight thought would get flu like cold. family told everyone always go hospital feel worsening symptoms matter tough think are. flu killer. 6.5mil adults, 933k people that's vaccinated recovered adults left, 10% general population, 14% eligible. 86% get vaccine (or reconverted) did. almost worth try. Yes, things trending positively, time know sure, it'll immediate. Majority Canadians uninformed could headline. Barring complete collapse vaccine process, done well target public setting everyone vaccine access, think yes everyone make regardless status. talking one one meetings doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre seeing anyone either way that‚Äôs choice. really haven‚Äôt liked analogy since started making rounds days ago (thanks Osterholm)...

He saying hurricane approaching several weeks...well, several weeks ago now. we‚Äôre ‚Äúeye storm,‚Äù implies already got hit half storm, right? high winds case counts, that‚Äôs really much storm. anything, weather gotten clear. 

Maybe writer getting annoyed semantics, still. üòÇ Bro need it, 30s man wtf ** Hungary 

You one job, OP Why?

If moderna pfizer repeated phase 3 trials, efficacy would lower due variants.  Fuck news reporters ‚Äúeverything awful‚Äù shtick. play game. get it. Go ahead. not.

Breaking news Either never traveled life...or far much money all. symptom slightly sore injection site. Absolutely nothing else. 9 people hour lot though vaccinations, least US. proof prior infection resolve issue associating symptoms psychosomatic problems.

In instances, it'd exact opposite. confirmed proof infection, upgrade merely suspecting beforehand, actually fair odds exacerbating psychosomatic symptoms.

However...

In psychosomatic symptoms previously infected, believe result -- previously infected, might result miracle cures psychosomatic symptoms.

But importantly, able sort confirmed infected versus help researchers dig various causes effects, psychosomatic otherwise. trip scheduled week Arizona see baseball games concert. One one cancelled, grocery stores getting ransacked. little surreal. Typo NBA canceled. watch basketball caused think ""Ummm."" I'm Jersey, got hit first--I sent work home following week really anxious since then. Yea, expecting lot downvotes, seems people appreciate question. far everyone really cool it.

However, read thread, notice one answer frustrating. Maybe someone come along share reference something. 

So far, said there's Phase 4 Trial needs conducted gain progress towards FDA Approval. asked details there's anything else follow that.

Maybe time I'm eligible (I'm low risk pool), vaccine FDA approved worry it. That's what's hoping for, believe case. believe eligible vaccine FDA Approved ask doctor explain tests missing bearing health conditions. doctor explain intelligently, able trust hold accountable decision. funniest thing american would say same, like line *America first* comparing apples pears. every country closed country stop spread country country. imagine China lie much would've closed started get world. world wide pandemic? no! 

it would great job america produce share world, even 90% america 10% afrika would ok *america first* selfish, zero days 2M vaccines administered supply 

Remember numbers really posting weekend. always lower regardless happens places closed reporting areas also closed two days 100 weekend UK , first two-digit days since early October.  
 
Things getting better. need stay vigilant, there's real hope now. Well, pretty clearly saying dip cases last weeks temporary we'd back December highs, worse. analogy fine...if anything close accurate. woefully wrong. think depends are! I‚Äôm portland know lot crazy anxious people lol. me, lot people. explain it.

It's true. 

US higher death rate per capita course pandemic right 7-day average. that's fair. lot people can't work home.

However people take precautions. masks, avoiding social gathering, etc. I'm sure rate infection higher.

As virus hopefully running easy targets. close 40% country may immune 60% may one's able willing take precautions slow virus down. Okay, Sleeping. trip Europe ended cruise included stops Egypt, Israel, Cyprus early March doubts whether countries might let us get boat. Egypt doctors come board take temperatures let us disembark. also Venice early trip, unbeknownst time, big outbreak Northern Italy starting. heard whole thing happening days later became super paranoid whether countries would let since one early hotspots. long ago, someone know got flight back nothing place staying (Couldn't even change different day), despite fact canceled funeral fee goes straight government airlines. thing lot money doesn‚Äôt even go TSA anything flying related. currently happening country (Serbia) secured lot vaccines already, say lot mean around 2.5 million more(bought 14million population 6million) problem, 1.6m people registered far numbers rise. Nobody else wants take it, there's actually extra vaccines already given away neighbouring countries.

Country starting wider campaign vaccinate people living rural areas main issue people take it, especially poor areas (6% opted in, richer areas 50%). problem now, cases rise people care preventive measures anymore due ""we vaccines, guys take won't"" feel bad Israel too. admin. 100 doses/100 people STILL cases plateauing Still...everything must remain shut schools closed anything else completely irresponsible Osterholm knows whole pandemic behind us, nobody pay attention anymore. Category 5...or more! I'm going cater inability unwillingness read. thing ohio, friends volunteered got leftovers    think first half hurricane analogy winter surge Shot 1 chillin. Mostly sore arm maybe little tired. Shot 2 MAY chillin, likely feverish chills  mid-Feb late Feb - started reading sub reddit daily, seeing videos coming China getting nervous. remember went grocery store bought whole bag canned goods whole bag frozen foods. went back next day started getting paper goods essentials. partner thought cuckoo, haha, like ""we need stock up! get sick need quarantine inside two weeks?"" Sad thing I've checked reddit day, every day year. Hoping April, I'll feel like check less frequently cases continue decline vaccinations increase :) Got vaccine today. National Guard gave mine really good needle, lol! gave us Moderna 94% effective strains mRNA vaccine works differently uses genetic code virus instead dead virus cells trigger immune response. supposed last longer that. made us wait 15 minutes could leave case side effects. one fell flopping. immediate side effects let know changes. 

Anyway, weighed risks thought get personal choice. hopeful put damn virus behind us done lot damage.  Right, every person take precautions got every person take precautions not. mention many people cannot choose work home. theory's oversimplification incorrect comes laughably privileged mindset. house gone 200k lol breastfeeding, passing antibodies baby getting vaccinated.

And greater percentage people first dose much slow things down?

I understand Pfizer said 21 days based science trying speed phase 3? care case rates? deaths hospitalizations control ( low ) else society going do? behavioral modifications ( masks, social distancing ) probably penetrated much going barring variant disease escapes vaccine protection also contagious, simply need move forward life.  Lmao thanks laugh Republican governor making stupid decision directly medical advice political reasons. police chief stating truth.

So yeah, based governor's behavior last year, cat better qualified Abbot. Yeah thought.

I'd say equivalent. can't required still EUA. incentivized though things like bonus. That‚Äôs it. People recognize activities spread COVID, also recognize there‚Äôs value starting return regular life. likely never reach 0 COVID transmission, vaccination, slow significantly reduce risk serious complications.

September state started machine gunning vaccines tell. contacted weeks ago I'm 43 without pre-existing conditions. They're trying get anyone everyone get shots arms (from tell) (I'm New Mexico) Oh people see think, ‚ÄúOh phew, it‚Äôs Hungarian human beings suffering, carry on‚Äù?  Absolutely agree, 12-week strategy. keep mind Biontech recommends second dose 3 6 weeks first, real-world data Israel showed much higher effectiveness 1 week second shot.

The best vaccine one arm, need teams. Let's pretend Abbott following expert medical four said Wednesday Abbott directly consult prior drastic shift policy. fourth said couldn‚Äôt say whether move good idea. Except places still mask rules. stadium packed basically saying want wear mask okay need Karen it. wear mine I‚Äôm means antivaxxer anything. signed weeks ago Pfizer one. appointment tomorrow text reminder today says I‚Äôm getting J&amp;J one. don‚Äôt know anyone received one guess I‚Äôm feeling unprepared. don‚Äôt know works anywhere else, around parts medical facilities Moderna &amp; ‚Äúpop up‚Äù sites getting Pfizer. work folks little confident (that‚Äôs quite right word) them. Im saying second dose needed. needed within 21 days. agree probably done speed phase 3 trials. Hey, charlatan. virus persist long anyone else get vaccine. even true plan travel countries different vaccine adoption rates.

You still don‚Äôt understand people continue safely stay home wait take efficacious vaccine, thereby decreasing chance infection.

You can‚Äôt stupid immoral, right? Pathetic charlatan trying force people health decisions without detailing potential risks. keep sending pharmacies. It‚Äôs extremely easy scale up. infrastructure already mean participating society?

the limitations restaurants (inside think), gyms, hotels crowded events. things show negative test result 3 days old. also include 2nd dose bundled jostle well? actually read study I'm sure timespan matter calculating masks effected total case rate. Finally, rational comment.  get restaurants, there's de-facto cap limit distanced tables. they're freaking really much. state sorry saying many open appointments essentials eligible think. I‚Äôm like fucking open Yeah mean that‚Äôs kind thought. trying understand she‚Äôs coming that, I‚Äôm gonna ask anything would make uncomfortable, therapy isn‚Äôt quite she‚Äôs wearing mask. death still considered Severe Adverse Incidence?  would ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù able get vaccine. would nice. Especially since everyone stop wearing masks tomorrow state. US evidently hardest-hit country Covid, therefore need vaccinate people first. mean yeah, kinda get bothered that. people restaurant bar, that‚Äôs people might infected, people could get infected. given know airborne transmission, see could potentially bad situation leads higher community spread. children still get covid (and daughter definitely socially distance wear mask now), Covid affect kids badly adults. long pre-existing conditions, completely locked down.  Anyone trained administer vaccines. Tamiflu for¬†influenza.

But, Tamiflu effective Tylenol flu. Guess I'm visiting New Zealand then

To clarify, I'm gonna get vaccinated sooner later, I'm downloading one vaccine passport things. happening. many privacy concerns Yeah, alot dogshit opinions. Take pea brain elsewhere still understand math. Delaying vaccine results higher probability getting covid. Right 0% protection virus around future. get vaccine chance getting covid 35% * P(exposure). delay X amount time, eventual protection 5% * P(exposure X weeks), sit 0% protection Someone shouldn‚Äôt expected lessen immunity sake greater good choice.

What would say someone waiting N98 mask better surgical mask meantime going around mask? I'd say they're missing big picture pandemics absolutely greater good individual's immunity. Mask mandates remain everyone offered vaccine

So May. one figures conveniently ignore individual european governments?  CDC federal government thinks fast

Or county. live Montgomery County. Near PG County, together formed ""we're going roll back restrictions later governor reasons"" entire time.  time ago checked zerocovid propaganda website Greek PM one models. guess outdated. Vegans lives defined eating meat represents identity values. 

You state anti-vaxxers identities values would attacked got vaccinated, different eating meat Vegan? necessarily. states like Texas Mississippi completely reopening states soon, could see horrible spread. caps really stopping virus. would masks vaccines distancing.

Further, social distancing mandates, restaurants still tables 6 feet apart, means basically still restrictions. everybody's idea travel same. many people looking get extended visa Thailand essentially live next months, them, 7 day quarantine really bad. Plus, Seychelles mega expensive Mexican culture completely different. Thailand beaches. understand Pfizer said 21 days based science trying speed phase 3?

Are presenting conspiracy theory determination use 21 days?

Pfizer used scientific data collected attempts create vaccine SARS MERS.

A single dose trial attempted run 2 existed mRNA vaccine MERS since 2017. confidence interval (CI) unreliable.

Triple dose mRNA vaccine trials run US three years pandemic provided serological insight need second dose administered ramp-up immune system avoid primed immune system rejecting vaccine.

After 21 days, human immune system starts ramp beyond 28 days efficacy single dose pretty solid.

You see, 18 years attempting create vaccine SARS MERS, learned immunity cross-immunity greatest obstacle.

If single-dose provided candidate form immunity already recent cold, vaccine produced zero reaction.

That window opportunity second dose short. second dose done manufacturer's recommendations, wasted.

Pfizer currently attempting determine best window third dose provide 96% efficacy variants. window third dose second dose looking like 9 11 days.

All done scientific evidence, tinfoil hats. Dude spent 6T bail junk mortgage bonds nobody batted eye. Pfizer That's probably actually want though-- think concern ""don't get covid party"" much ""don't party elsewhere bring new variants back broader community.""

I'm personally concerned variants, clear people petrified community whole based reaction college students bringing British variant back local campus holiday breaks. imagine it'll next month, worst May Doubt it. need get past initial exposure. flu killed untold millions first time spread. it‚Äôs (mostly) nuisance live with. need get population past first couple exposures. anyone acting like spoiled brat yourself. think many us excluded stimulus still middle class (and ones paying bulk taxes fund it) every right opinion express frustration. know everyone's situation impact lives COVID.

This 'eat rich' mentality still targeted middle class. Also, federal government pay bills, simply collects redistributes wealth. Tax payers pay bills not. Whoops! Mods, remove post redundant. Two. 90% one getting nursing homes regular testing catch outbreaks contain them. trying convince mom nope, wants Johnson Johnson... Moderna every pharmacy she‚Äôs eligible nope. Shame still released kids Yeah welcome club. mental health services health plan before? find hard believe didn‚Äôt typically side effects hit till much later. long drive hours long good go :) people say money changed him, DMT lol Bobby Lee‚Äôs Tiger Belly, moms house Tom Segura Christina P, King sting Theo Von Brendan Schuab want better mood. 

Tom segura Bert kresisher came 2 bears 1 cave, I‚Äôve lately know one lockstep teachers, didn‚Äôt even come reopening plan. I‚Äôve herd thing teachers well, including platform Toilet paper. Last checked, people sitting bar booth wearing masks. continue wear one...that's choice. exactly Missouri along. never mask mandate Missouri, one Kansas City St. Louis. 2nd article google typed ""j&amp;j vaccine vs others""

Although Johnson Johnson vaccine trial showed lower efficacy rate preventing moderate severe cases, successful stopping serious illness, 100 percent effective preventing hospitalizations death. I'd argue people saying J&amp;J vaccine WORSE - efficacy rate US 72% (66% world wide) take pictures names, post online, attach bios. considered he‚Äôs acting like moron sometimes even morons recognize Nice see sanity coming Texas. Though I'm sure soon see stories anti-maskers screaming threatening poor store employee's simply trying enforce store policy mask wearing. society function yes, making one's *safety* people's responsibility perfectly reasonable. Examples: cannot drive drunk, speed, leave seat belt off. actions endanger you, put others risk. 

Covid different. Wearing mask meant prevent spread new disease we're still learning years come. people say, *""Your health responsibility. body, choice!""* well truly ignorant. ""I even drink much. felt totally control"" killed someone car. ""Geeze, I'm sorry. think going fast"" hit someone's kid residential neighborhood going 45 20 zone. hey, body, choice, right? OK feel fine asymptomatically spreading disease people. 

And thing is, actions crimes. wearing mask isn't. Wearing one simple act logic compassion help *everyone* get soon possible. We've patients UCHealth year. sent messages 3 weeks ago saying UCHealth patients automatically registered vaccine would receive invitations schedule became eligible.

I got invitation schedule March 5th able schedule first dose March 6th, second dose April 3rd. Seriously? lost total respect guy Illinois twice many nursing home residents per capita Florida. course greater portion deaths would nursing homes Illinois. frankly, 34% abysmal considering Florida one lowest rates nursing home usage state. putting *rag* face, disrespecting yourself, dude. 

Side note: wear clothes outdoors? so, what's difference ""No shirt, service"" ""No mask, service""? Fort Worth Eagleton Pawnee dallas gathered. (lived area 11 years). transplanted trans ass Fort Worth due daughter I'm working turning blue! things start trending way extrenely paranoid?

Unfortunately since long time ago, even vaccines available, people think need vaccinate children go back normal else everyone suddenly die, even they're fully vaccinated, go around spread everything fine everyone risk fully vaccinated. 

Spoiler alert: don't, extremely unlikely someone &lt;20 y/o gets severe covid symptoms. Listen Last Podcast Left.

Idk interests that's good one. kind stuff into? could probably recommend would love South Dakota vaccines approved used people including immunosuppressed. read ""WHOLE"" thing. That's knew wrong originally cherry picking lines defend understanding order.

If past 3am you... go bed :) got first dose Pfizer. preferred vaccine I‚Äôm glad available!

As cautionary tale, parents (65+) picky held JnJ. turned vaccine turn. trouble getting appointment picky vaccines opening people. really case tho. blue people still choose wear mask rush get vaccinated.

The red parts wont get vaccinated much, wont wear masks (law not) wont social distance. Theyll get sick faster.. He's big fan governor Abbott (TX governor) dinner governor's mansion pretty often. questions. assume shows bc spouse able get vaccinated asking. registered us, two healthy 30 yo, took insurance info, within 10mins done. spent another 15min store, request, left.

Y'all thank 89 year old grandparents 66 year old parents refusing take :( seem insufferable sure Thank you. literally laughed loud Crazy people downvote question. 74 million people least.... So, Alaska gotten vaccine per capita states? Well theres also lot less people, lot people living places makes sense send one larger shipment cover everyone wish information explain Morocco much better rest Africa. look number vaccines administered continent, Morocco laughable ahead countries. couple weeks ago, saw article saying Morocco administered 94% doses continent!

Why African country, particular, one successful vaccination campaigns world rest continent barely able vaccinate anyone? 100% statistic grossly Texas disgrace.

It‚Äôs okay say it.  Alaska get preferential treatment vaccine states, anyway?

If go these\[1\] stats, used 70% doses, puts bottom 5 states. yet they're tied 1st place look percentage people got least one shot, they're ahead states look rate fully vaccinated people.

\[1\] good thing side effects good sign working. need seeking sympathy you. also heavily caught two party politics-as-a-sport thing much discuss.

I make six figures I'm ashamed it, flaunt it. put work get I'm proud accomplishments. know people industry saddled student debt short amount time careers. student debt impacted pandemic one year wages set pandemic excluded stimulus eligibility. also know people make cutoff lost jobs otherwise financially impacted. 

Regardless, enjoy petty posturing Reddit arguments. ""..no person may required jurisdiction wear mandate wearing face coverings.""

""No jurisdiction may impose penalty kind failure wear face covering failure mandate customers employees wear face coverings..""

I'll respond words people need stop opining they've actually read damn thing. moved California progressive whatever Austin? Hahaha moron. Daily case death growth rates implementation mask mandates **were statistically different reference period.**  

The factual numbers included see yourself. 1.9% within margin error.  

Nice try. wrong wrong year, science prove it. It‚Äôs shocking dense are. good one. live AZ, fun visit small rural towns experience utter contempt locals us city slickers, depend weekend visits make towns economically viable. Wow I‚Äôd jump that... far I‚Äôm planning sleeping week 2 rental car track shot. Jaime pull No, people, chances spreading including states.


It ain‚Äôt hard, son. thing Canada. strict order importance getting vaccinated started getting around 90+ year olds. end summer millenials start getting vaccinated here. OTOH, there's also point since we've gotten *most* people higher age groups, becomes greater benefit focus getting much vaccine many arms possible. people vaccinated, we'll slow spread, protect unvaccinated higher risk groups. stoned watched lol long scheduled for? moved CO can't find anywhere appointments available. Honestly? No. 

Covid never dangerous enough would take eliminate without herd immunity. Texas's cases/hospitalizations/deaths go bit tomorrow onwards, even go all, that's proof we're gonna clear soon. joe hates mask hates lockdowns

he moved California TX avoid all

now move mandates associated statistically significant decreases county-level daily COVID-19 case death growth rates within 20 days implementation

How embarrassing you.  guess Joe move again,

probably Florida Why? Would agree comparing percentage Texans covid compared percentage Iowans covid statistically relevant comparing raw number cases trying decide state better policy wise? Thank you, fear bad needs maximum dosage laughing gas legally give dentist needs work done involves numbing. safe inhalant version, I'd signing that! knows skipping vaccine option, prepared need two shots. I'm trying find something works well causes little panic possible!  Alright. Go ahead. Explain hasn‚Äôt political months now. 
In Detroit new demand going back district provide mental health services. Why? don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm questioning virtue mental health services. don‚Äôt know district pay prerequisite haven‚Äôt even school 12 months. 
If you‚Äôve vaccinated you‚Äôre still worried public I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre one doesn‚Äôt trust science numbers point. Masks, well...elementary kids. think wipes week. zero time clean classes, plus online classes too. half students chose home learning whole clusterfuck, least classrooms half full. Basically, school board decided Wednesday, yea person starting Tuesday. Zero planning preparation teachers staff paid price. funny thing typical counter rural areas feed cities without blue areas starve.

Who think paying food? Nothing pollutes oceans air becomes viral breeding ground quite like cruise ship.

Packed hundreds humans floating metal container, cruise ships spew much CO2 1 million cars daily.

All trash feces goes straight ocean cause open water.

If get coronavirus, probably get norovirus.

The vast majority cruise ship employees paid low wages born socioeconomically depressed countries.

The cruise industry seriously fucked worst way ""travel"". 

I hope cruise industry dies hope y'all discover interesting, humane, environmentally friendly adventures. go casino resort. [I Okay, lot people chosen either stay home take lower risk vacations allow social distancing, within driving distance. Something like ever seen people thirties younger die anything else that‚Äôs incredibly rare?

Imagine could get one other, think would right thing do? SHUT FUCK VIRUS BECOME POLITICAL

JUST SHUT FUCK places never enforced rules anyway. source! :)  there‚Äôs point trying?

Trying actually worked us. feel ya pain Well going celebrating fully vaccinated, appears I‚Äôll degree stranded 2-3 feet snow, working, since work never closes. Joys Colorado. Lol us go make friends/ talk girls lol Yep. held year before. 1936 Winter Olympics 1936 Summer Olympics, held Germany, immediately come mind. We‚Äôll join California, short years. üòÇ tribes Alaska done great job getting folks vaccinated. state able offer vaccine widely building upon success. Great news around.  think week two won‚Äôt necessary. third time posted week. Nice! I'm 19 healthy still months away. pandemic revealed people absolutely ability think abstractly numbers generally use common sense.

It explains lot hysteria car maskers.  mean actual lockdowns, yeah work. US did, nope. saw this, sorry! case covid way back March 2020, full year positive got vaccine. actually tested antibodies November negative, bet ass felt though needed vaccine dont think understand. scientific fact corona doesnt affect kids much, thats talking about. idea vaccines interact immune systems kids, disregarding testing process simply reckless naive 10,000% Houston, don‚Äôt pay attention. Ask Abbott much loves Judge Lina Hidalgo. Hispanic badass woman power. like 99% people ever lived city wouldnt caught dead shithole middle buttfuck nowhere texas. Even dumb fucks like Rogan. Yeah get shit thrown city passing guidelines restrictive state uh. muh small gubmint? stop except unlucky ones kill. specially threatened Houston legal action tried enforce shutdowns Austin weird sense feels like town, like metropolitan city.

Austin feels like town? Waco feels like town. College Station feels like town. Austin feels like city. fun. *cries r/Houston* Texas doesn‚Äôt spike cases deaths lift mask mandate, mean start rolling back restrictions everywhere else? Austin - Texans love Texas, hate republican culture. Please share young kids dying covid. It‚Äôs literally always left leaning. much crying comments ü§£ Q anon conspiracy theorist Karen‚Äôs lmao like Dallas City Hall building. Murals 19th century settlers massacre-ing Indians line halls. person Austin, would like live thank you. 

Thank everyone Texas who‚Äôs going continue wearing masks despite idiot governor üíï Also traffic ever disease, even theoretically possible, disease asymptomatic also extremely deadly? Federal government: something liberal 
Abbott: dare you, can't drag texas along liberal agenda, deserve autonomy!

Austin: something liberal 
Abbott: dare you, part texas can't thing, tell you!  lies deceive lot time. trust process Small also big brother Got links study? Good job Alaska! would love hit Alaska right now. less it. (Probability hard explain!)

It might help explain vaccines tested little clear detail. Vaccines trials recruit bunch people similar demographics (age, location, health history, etc.) split two equivalent groups. 

Group 1 gets fake vaccine, group 2 gets real one.

At end trial, check see many people group got COVID. compare Group 1 Group 2 see difference is.

Let's say trial recruits 30,000 people, 210 cases COVID across participants. those, 200 cases Group 1 10 cases Group 2.

Because people recruited way randomly divided up, we'd expect roughly number exposed COVID groups. vaccine work all, would expected another 200 cases Group 2. Instead, saw 10. Looks like vaccine helping!

Because vaccine prevented 190 200 cases expecting see, say showed 95% efficacy.

It's useful look tell us. tell us anything chances catching COVID overall, tell us anything masks/social distancing/etc. says going get COVID anyway, whatever reason, vaccine 95% chance stopping happening.

So 72% efficacy vaccine like J&amp;J, means 100 times already going get moderate case COVID-19 rest defenses failed, 72 prevented. wish people concerned contracting it, instead chalking ""do die not"". sense focus mortality essentially told people ""you're 99% likely fine"" interpret ""just flu"" led lack compliance. framing fucked start largely blame shitshow. 
 
But also wish vaccine people focused transmission symptoms. mean, I'm virologist maybe understand enough time anything target spike proteins. get impression could tried different approaches instead aiming same, apparently insufficient, goal. Fun fact: Austin also far lower rate obesity rest Texas, America's fattest cities... Don‚Äôt kids higher chance dying flu? 

If weren‚Äôt worried going flu season past, shouldn‚Äôt adults vaccinated. Yeah raised Republican Texas tbh 

Recently actually choose voting 

I‚Äôve come hate republicans around Even family (especially ones quoting bible verses don‚Äôt actually got church) (and beliefs conspiracy theories without proof)

Some good people like manager // means well expects lot bit touch // good management really

Tbh powerful country world expect protections place set Governemnt intervention shit starts hit fan (like recently) turn another setting like house fire


We building codes civil engineers don‚Äôt we? Shouldn‚Äôt checks balances economy? mean instant ones something argue 9 months

I'm glad brought hardly anyone mentions resoundingly horrifying consideration this: no, before. 
 
When outbreaks ancient civilizations, people could develop herd immunity (after pains) populations relatively minuscule back then. city *and region* ancient Greece peak might host hundred thousand people. metropolitan area Athens alone nearly 4 million people. 
Mutations happen percentage, i.e. maybe 1 10,000 replications results new mutation (it's example number, know actual rate mutation average). region surrounding Athens (Attica), maybe 300,000 people, dealing 30 mutations. course mutations harmless, like person developing heterochromia (eyes separate colors). say maybe 1 500 mutations actually make virus virulent dangerous. Meaning outbreak ancient Attica unlikely produce mutation changed game. 
 
Now course cities alone large urban region host mutations. *worse* live interconnected world airplanes ships effectively one large region known Earth. one virus spread every corner within weeks months. one year ago. 
 
That means we're going see mutations we've **ever seen human history**. help coronavirus particularly known mutating. mutations keep popping developing features like infectivity vaccine resistancy, virus **doesn't go away**. public health officials urging us vaccinate slow spread countries, get rest world vaccinated ASAP - good. 
Even everyone United States vaccinated sufficiently current strains, virus rampant Malawi breeds strain happens resistant vaccine, going reset efforts. 
 
We've got almost 8 billion people planet now. projections expect going take us several *years* concerted effort loads money get world vaccinated. means we're going see new mutations pop over. **Unlike anything we've ever seen human history**. Natural herd immunity work here. look Brazil P1 them. honest, I'd much rather Israel's position. sticking process supported scientific evidence.

Canada, hand, seems arbitrarily decided 4 month gap. data suggest that, specifically, 4 month gap better option 21/28 days suggested manufacturer, 90 days used elsewhere? talking specifically human body better equipped fighting covid 4 month interval 28 days estimates put around 4-8 times higher. There‚Äôs nothing vaccine that‚Äôs gonna hurt healthy cuts. Huge old fat fucks take problem. already know virus lethal older people lol  make sense tho. immune systems work differently age, young immune systems typically stronger old immune systems, viruses actually lethal young healthy, namely spanish flu Yes. little tired right after. got home experienced fatigue gnarly fever night. able drive home.

Soooo I‚Äôm totally cool with, least, pseudo monopolies put nasty little word grouping...for company industry dominated select second time, know exactly mean. Yah old people protected won‚Äôt die. That‚Äôs whole point. plataue? watch little bit basketball, me. paired news Tom Hanks Rita Wilson tested positive. don‚Äôt pay much attention basketball, don‚Äôt follow celeb news much, think paired together 2 things made realize going get serious. thats opposite counter productive tho. theres limited supply vaccines, makes sense people minimal risk get compared people working day day grocery stores essential jobs. obviously available doses nobodys getting them, let anyone get them, long supplies limited, makes total logical sense prioritize people risk one statements thst **know** made spot. Video games, fitness, movies, music, computers, comedy. Anything realm would awesome! Impressive numbers imo. Compare europe.  stop making dumb rules fully vaccinated people still can‚Äôt shit Watch people anti government involvement fucking stunned people disagree government wants. said, getting back school first priority providing additional mental health services second.

I think taking care people's health important making sure school starts weeks sooner....but you, man.  Obviously, going agree. killed 0.15% US population span year, even country bounced (and of) restrictions. dangerous? shit makes laugh. liken last week American redditors jerking 'winning' terms citizens vaccinated.

Doesn't matter absolute morons running certain states. March 11th. remember distinctly night Tom Hanks Rita Wilson announced tested positive NBA suspended it‚Äôs season. shortly work shut down. damn county can't pronounce Bexar correctly anyhow. Wow 25? That‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm small person high end normal. could eat burrito dinner considered eligible. Alaska got bunch Indian health service VA DOD large percentage population qualifies Proud Austin! Wish could proud Governor. think pfizer/moderna better.

 Depends really. wasn‚Äôt ever approached cop enforcer. hear people üëåüèª Happened long ago. See AISD sends shitload cash districts bc cash (we blue). time dont ‚Äú throw side ‚Äú weighed pros cons one. matter weighing possible long-term, severe side effects possible effective treatment condition. examined different possible side effects, thought could live played huge role. metric? Indianapolis, people receiving vaccines Indy Motor Speedway. Recipients drive infield car they‚Äôre giving shots. Parents got yesterday. Ok fine made laugh Anyone luck getting shot Alabama 65 pre existing conditions? sure call talk see there‚Äôs leftover partner. locked up. Basically assault exporting something mean banned exported. EU legal instrument block exports used it. UK much mechanism disposal. mean kids? Aw man üòÇ sounds like fun lol same, logic, government murderers outlaw tobacco. see way. not? consistently apply reasoning things? vitriol ""cowardly"" politicians outlaw something kills 480,000 people year?

Or here's another question. blame Joe Biden implementing federal mask mandate? He's President month now. failure issue nationwide mask mandate make murderer? Yep desensitizes people idea. becomes less appalling digestible. People really stop making jokes things appalling. doesn‚Äôt help. Since technically wasn‚Äôt turn, mention second dose concern won‚Äôt able get second dose time? Alaska announced anyone age 16 get vaccinated there. Hopefully states follow lead away arbitrary vaccine phases. vast majority vaccinated COVID seniors. man used chief Austin (I live area) outstanding still is. always type refuse cower politicians often status quo quiet. calls injustice discrimination always just. allot respect him. think would make outstanding governor Texas. im saying dont lie get vaccine guise health issues could come back bite financially. insurance would get wind either kick lying real fake health issues would dramatically increase premiums. Getting vaccine based illness insurance aware thats actually true wont change premiums unless trying deceive insurance medical issues actually have, fraud anyway. got pretty bad reactions survived would get again. First time I‚Äôd ever gotten rash, EVER, take benedryl. Definitely decently high fever work next night didn‚Äôt bother checking it. Shook hard muscles aches chills, one worst headaches life. (And get migraines). Nausea, appetite, couldn‚Äôt get warm. subsided 48 hours.

I know experience might sound scary moral don‚Äôt work next day find way get it, think coupled everything else made way worse.

Also we‚Äôre pretty good holding plane something important vaccine.

And doses going middle nowhere aren‚Äôt restricted. Show town, inoculate everybody, move along. lot easier towns couple hundred people big cities.

The big cities, specifically Anchorage area, vaccine rollout actually going slowest. They‚Äôre starting hit limits acceptance. know people done that. Wrong. Super safe. Israel, UK, UAE, Serbia. That‚Äôs pretty funny honestly, people need stop pussies Part Pfizer vaccine produced UK, exported

The knowledge produce Oxford vaccine (at cost) exported, people went India help set example

I post link result post deleted FWIW elderly population seem quarantine somewhat. answer beyond that. Five year survival rate cancers 71.1%. 29.9% chance dying look still alive living. Jealous. country telling eligible till June.  Hospitalizations continue trend nyc. Seriously, first dose totally understood reaction grandpa Willy Wonka. Felt whole extreme euphoria nearly cried. 

Didn't get reaction second one. sense hope. Still nice though. Maybe decisions weren‚Äôt awful first place...... crazy

batshit got us first place, sir. Got that, too. I'll file away safe keeping now. get it, let's make unfounded claims tell people everything ok we're harm good rational logic means using science. Sweet job, bro. apologies, got mixed another commenter chain. Fortunately there's trajectory speak of. variants expected get less deadly time anyway. Can't wait travel Smithsonian future grandkids tell great pandemic 2020. Knowing luck, last person vaccinated state California. live alone, I‚Äôm working home, don‚Äôt pre-existing health conditions don‚Äôt fall protected classes California says prioritize.

The obvious thing start vaccination campaign focus healthcare workers elderly. that, science less clear politics take over. political use Californian politicians. I‚Äôm wealthy enough bribe corrupt assholes I‚Äôm also privileged many ways I‚Äôm worthless anything taxes. absolutely wrong front. care read--which know difficult people like you--please take compare apples oranges, especially dealing rotten apples:

"" 55% California residents live counties [high ‚Äúsocial vulnerability‚Äù ‚Äî measure severely disease outbreak might affect region ‚Äî quarter Floridians do. California‚Äôs rate [overcrowding metric linked coronavirus spread, also double Florida‚Äôs. "" yeah go get N95. people continue wear masks settings foreseeable future point needs end. want protect even option that. Cloth mask theater going away though. NY. 12 Alaskans rejoice. guy credible Tweets conspiracy theories? People wanted dooms day mad everywhere. vaccinating state residents there? assume everyone wants full back office instead hybrid option annoying eager coworker everyone hates lol Good you. smart decision. could damn well saved life decision thought vaccine distribution proportionate population True, think takes degree rocket surgery administer vaccine shot. Presumably citizen volunteers could trained quickly deliver vaccine. Perhaps ""mix"" needed Pfizer, least trained enough able jam syringe someone's arm depress plunger.

Frankly, could get vaccine auto-injectors like epi-pen... literally idiot could themselves. 

In mean time, plenty capacity pharmacies, clinics etc handle it. great idea. spend lot time driving rural areas often Dollar General chain business miles rural areas. Seems like perfect place deploy J&amp;J vaccine, since existing refrigeration capabilities would handle vaccine need manage return appointments. realize California(full lock down, panic masking) Florida (very little lock panic masking) similar numbers. Almost like lock downs shit except hurt people Sturgeon SNP anything long Westminister hope every one decisions prove better totally *own* English. Covid changed probably made worse

I hope SNP get arse kicked next elections sad thing strong independence policies many doses think realistically expect end March then? 'Georgia Walby, Long Covid Wales support group, said: ""These one-stop-shop clinics needed people energy resources go back forth GP referred different clinics. need go one place treated.

""You give - listened GP, give up. put ringing takes much energy, phone call becomes battle.""'

The experience people chronic health conditions long covid. studies reinfection children? Spouse almost fully vaccinated. Baby COVID months ago. I‚Äôm wondering long considered immune/safe. never said would break contract EU asking that? it‚Äôs still less 1%. I‚Äôll take chances. Public masking impossible enforce literally see past year. drive dad 130 miles away lives get vaccination NY. think definitely British thing two issue everyone referencing NZ Australia. 
1. islands don‚Äôt open boards like US. hundreds thousands people cross border 2020, 5% covid would cause spikes ever went.
2. US stupid reason report data regionally. NZ Australia do. lock regions needed whole country. US created regions control spread least reported data state state. Literally US peak surge 20% country coming peaks approaching record decline cause 2 states surges (CA TX) overpowered decline factor 10. People held restrictions something happening 1,000s miles away. That's pretty moronic way looking it. ""We've worse impact"" mean impact decisions made wrong. Look cases...they went Vegas right opening up. That's factual, simply look graphs. 

We hear hear \*everyone\*. shitshow all. Whether personally like mask mandate bearing science behind it. factual remove mask mandate, numbers go up. hope one disagrees completely wrong regard. question that, much increase really gain letting people prove 'American spirit' buying oversized bags potato chips Walmart without mask? got first shot Feb 26 (Phizer) point weekend got virus. trouble catching breath feel like flu, vitals stable wonder much worse I'd gotten least one shot. Alaska honor-system based anyways, eligibility screening proof required.  ton anti-mitigation people now. can't accept things sucked before, 100% go exactly back life pre-pandemic, happen immediately, including going office 40+ hours week, sitting next exact people end hating seeing way loved ones friends, 10 hours commuting time. know US well vaccines. countries moving pace? Hoping travel internationally year early next year.  Facts always annoy people can't accept them. Damn, shut lmao usually get flu shot target wondering would get game here. definitely infrastructure place already. Gotcha, thanks help! happily wearing mask pandemic. wear non-pandemic times. Interesting. know locations Walmart. reach rural population, great, refrigeration capacity, limited J&amp;J vaccine (at least now)? know perception politicized Republicans anti-mask, feeling younger demographics going clubs/bars parties without masks likely Democrats, meaning likely less politicized think?

I think wearing mask small ask, say zero burden. zero burden, I'd happily wear every year flu season precaution, I'm sure people thing. think questions that's bit hard get right survey. I'll wear mask and/or socially distance (stay home) I'm sick day day basis would hope pack trader joes work again. US Supreme Court said public health measures enforced health departments. would AZ break contracts EU, could sued existance breaking contract? Really? one getting turned NY/NJ sign attestation qualify. Businesses largely self-enforce people respect severity pandemic also abide it, especially fear potential repercussions. Lol stop already. They're getting vaccine rapidly kill local grandma anymore showing there. heard pharmacies aren‚Äôt bothering residency vaccines appointments one using them. probably call one see care not. Pfizer partial order both? Places like New York City gone way prioritize access vaccine communities day one, still hard time convincing get vaccine. Providing photographic evidence person's I.D. phone often work proof I.D. necessary, I'd get physical copy too. aren‚Äôt stopping deliveries Pfizer also Pfizer track schedule they‚Äôre last minute cuts deliveries What's got whether UK de facto vaccine export ban?

Why Canada get doses manufactured EU UK? Feel free wear much like. leave house flu sure wear them, hopefully virus helped change hero culture work. Ideally people start using sick days now. mean? agree second dose needed, first dose efficacy level 21 days fantastic. agree, also seems jive ""excess"" death figures ballpark. You‚Äôre welcome mask see fit. don‚Äôt try force others. us hate masks don‚Äôt want wear them. good trajectory on, it? route talking about? really understand post. absolutely agree. Especially hearing vaccine sites turning people minor discrepancy eligibility. It‚Äôs counterproductive really, there‚Äôs someone get vaccinated, vaccinate them! That‚Äôs one less person contract covid hindsight still protects old peeps. 

But again, Fauci knows blah blah, doesn‚Äôt make sense offering vaccines everyone right now. people vaccinated better, matter age virus still gonna circulate. sister vaccinated yesterday asked ID professional medical. proof comorbidity. We've unfortunately spent last year telling wearing mask literally zero burden. really divisive issue that's become extremely politicized unfortunately. Avanti bought Croda July 2020  CNN sweating. Exactly. mandates stupid - don‚Äôt need them. invisible hand works. like people go road another don‚Äôt need mask, others won‚Äôt go business don‚Äôt feel comfortable. know breaking contract get sued right? AZ cannot show best efforts fulfill EU contract, whilst maintaining contracts massively sued. add huge possible punative damages causing deaths AZ might survive. explain AZ would take route? I'm really sure we're still talking things?? asked wanted get vaccines UK plants. whole conflict AZ EU Januar/Februar EU hoped get exactly that. 
If look earlier replies even contest UK right allow exports AZ plants. see thing export ban result ban would have, apparently think different officially ban theoretical, non-existing vaccines would allowed exported. Let's agree disagree. 
Anyway, good procrastination work day. really, really think research say that's case. believed extends immunity really know that. 

It's pretty well known increases immunity, really much. hope really extends immunity otherwise we're using second doses well could. Alaska key advantage. Native American reservations receive special vaccine allotments federal government, Alaska‚Äôs Native American population highest per capita US. 

So they‚Äôve done incredibly well keep mind giving somewhere like Wyoming flack  Yes. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated measles still wouldn‚Äôt spend time someone measles unless it‚Äôs spouse child. I‚Äôm healthy enough colds/flu low risk me, wouldn‚Äôt jumping chance hang sick person.  ""just months!!!!!"" got first Moderna dose weekend terrible pain whenever slightly moved arm. sleep overnight, kept waking pain. CDC says taking pain relievers OK shot (not before). Tylenol made go painful sore, felt normal sore without Tylenol next night. heard anyone else arm pain bad probably pretty unlikely! I'm rock climber I'm wondering related lot muscle area. think vaccine supply increasing, healthcare nurse workforce isn't, least EU countries, maybe case USA also? guess. Since citizens cannot shoot vaccine..... dumb, I‚Äôm SC appointment next week. I‚Äôm 41 BMI 30. 

Leaving states decide stupid, dumb ass plan got stuck with. Welcome data ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù weather man least gives 50 50 Congrats!üéâ Factually correct, intentionally misleading (as case majority headlines). not? People pay less dollar it. Would great locations. aware, state taking longer time lower eligibility requirements, may also good thing. might mean state much lower vaccine hesitancy metaphorical yet effective example divide conquer. lipids used make Pfizer vaccine, one mentions though! problems last president politicize facemasks. fact biggest argument wearing facemask pandemic still ongoing akin saying ""seatbelts shoes inhibit freedom.""

And worst part already forgot failing ERCOT. governor &amp; party already washed hands anything electric grid, &amp; plan throw ERCOT management bus &amp; call day. safely bet grid fail another natural disaster 2032 failed 2021 &amp; 2011! people either die lose personal property (burning furniture stay warm, burn house result). Got J J vaccine last night. Woke morning got bad chills body aches headache. even got vaccine felt like coming cold something. mild body aches headache. possible previous cold intensified side effects? Thanks idea reference coming amazing hahaha Lower life expectancy doesn‚Äôt equate younger population...but reproduction immigration rates would. Also, lower life expectancy associated higher rates certain medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, BMI, etc...), people living conditions qualify vaccine rest population.

Not mention considering year ago considered vaccine 12-18 months away- year later today approaching quarter eligible Americans vaccinated three highly effective vaccines available. I'm grateful progress we've making. uncomfortable fact one wants address. Thompson, president Market Basket Food Stores, said employees vendors still asked wear masks barriers sanitizing stations remain place, stores rely signage remind customers masks still recommended.

This interesting me. live Texas I've actually never been, sounds like Market Basket allowing customers wear masks. tell take effect today, someone Texas tell case? I'm actually really interested know one would allowed Market Basket without mask right effects would have. Certainly looks like see what's happening South Italy right now. Yeah. make sense. next year rebranded cold? bit infectious, ""way"" infectious. Doesn‚Äôt say article. Found different article:

Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts. Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, California, Hawaii Ohio. like thought lipids could ever produced UK. fact though current Pfizer production line relies lipids things coming UK.

It's easy change quickly there's probably reason went UK based supplier EU options.  NYT much better CNN Absolutely. pain, good. problem is, ZERO business clothes left fit including suits.  Considering UK one worst hit economies world Scotland much stringent England lockdowns (and weaker economy slower growth anyway) economy must absolutely wrecked right now. I‚Äôd say military involved national security need access classified materials given kind preference 2 cents.

Edit - understand classified material hard access remotely could wrong Lol...what 16 others? Average AK ping around 70ms low end way 130 bad day, that's ""good"" connection. Used get 70-80 pretty consistently average day around 100ms since moved servers Chicago.

Also, gonna move Alaska wanna live Anchorage. Anchorage sucks. disadvantages small town big city, none upside IMO.  neighbor black, asked excited vaccine, said afraid doesn‚Äôt believe tested well enough. didn‚Äôt try change mind, listened. 

Eventually said feel safe enough get it, wants Pfizer, JJ Moderna. think trusts company more. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I think it. She‚Äôs simply cautious person. got Maryland, appointment one even asks eligibility. problem seems finding anywhere doses, kept refreshing Walgreens website one popped took right away EU doesn‚Äôt export vaccines. 

Private companies think people gonna wear masks every winter 1000 people going hospital something, lost goddamn mind. Brilliant! probably remove sandwich first though. Yes, reality right now. mean use facilities need be. South Carolina 16 others Nobody tells expensive replace wardrobe lose bunch weight! It‚Äôs pain - it‚Äôs good pain?

Congratulations success! Hey, I‚Äôm statistic!  astrazeneca vaccine fine too, US approves it. Unrelated heard bad things live show. TV show funny heard going person, guys aren‚Äôt really stand comics reminder UK variant first identified early September circulation least long, more. Ah shit. go again. like previous 2-3 days deliveries seems like 7 million bulk drop consistent daily routine supermarkets around stated they'll follow governors orders stop mask wearing mandates. people wonder exactly US became full vehement anti maskers? shit like this, reopening plans mention removing masks distancing, drives people conspiratorial thinking. Amarillo? government put trades/construction essential list vaccines, essential whole time working. somehow data telecom well finance made there... fuck guess lol high native population

..OK? one? seals killer whales. exactly Canada doing. Uncanny parallel. Pfizer using Croda lipids amongst things contract states. Go Amarillo, open availability. residency requirements. Would good way lose business IMO. case numbers way everyone wants vaccine one, people going want go stores anymore require masks states? Florida huge elderly population, actually ranks 36th nursing home residents per capita. Nursing homes are, course, deadly spread been. account consider relatively unscathed first wave anyone knew treat it, Florida's mortality numbers honestly pretty bad.

Not bad Arizona, though. feel like need stop loosening restrictions theae new variants. states this. Remove barriers. high risk groups already waitlist thus still ahead.

Ok deliver equally countries already ordered enough everybody? doubt ""costumers"" would mind getting dosis earlier. Seems like pure sales pitch sell promising earlier delivery...? Bro literally link video suggest this, help notice require social ask citizenship id. see comedy skit, entire global population flies US get vaccine one one. fact. possibility still let guard down. Get vaccine. He's absolutely right like everything regarding COVID. 

Again, facts challenging make wrong. means understand reject facts feelings. really heartening see nursing home deaths plummet countries world regardless cases. read somewhere even Sao Paulo, misery going throughput Brazil moment, nursing home deaths fallen something like 70% last month. can't disagree premise, opportunity US January 2020.

Arguably, late even then. likely COVID widely circulating [before people even heard way COVID staying out. Right. get that. saying, think regular guy street knows cares details. care vaccine producers Europe exporting vaccines shortages Europe. surprised sort unrest happens. hope gunnu make smarmy joke one lives I'm educated checking 730k+ population that's pretty cool Greece announced opening tourism starting may 14th Coming soon local market: Vaccinated Mother's Milk, available pints, half gallons gallons. cases, deaths clustered neighborhoods immigrant essential workers. communities, significant fraction working men even though it‚Äôs large number statewide.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, AIDS epidemic often described wiping ‚Äòan entire generation‚Äô gay men. places like Village NYC basically did. don‚Äôt understand chose live unhealthy lifestyle priority vaccines. Sensationalizing vaccine goes effective fully effective suddenly 2 weeks second shot causes mistrust confusion. tell people straight. Vaccines start demonstrate effectiveness days first shot build toward peak effectiveness two weeks 2nd. complicated difficult communicate. looks like places lowest vax rates highest percent positive new cases predominantly Arab, Bedouin, Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas. likely vax hesitation combined low adherence mask wearing social distancing, whether voluntarily large families small apartments due poverty. It‚Äôs great him. Yet EU didn‚Äôt sign contract giving rights vaccines.

And clearly regretting actions. Right, people super vocal they're scared covid worried getting hear ""I'm worried giving others"". worrying getting covid kind first prerequisite worrying giving covid. They've got nothing export since entire tiny supply purchased possible demand populations currently available lessening? Perhaps need extend people US enough doses go around daily think means he‚Äôs living someone anti-vaxxer, thinks bill gates put nanobots vaccine private sector. 

I don‚Äôt understand hold is. isn‚Äôt everywhere administers flu shots also administering vaccine? They‚Äôve ramped 0 millions doses year. 

It‚Äôs one impressive manufacturing efforts ever.

Acting bottlenecks unexpected thing makes sense. Austin‚Äôs population boom incredibly recent. Also people don‚Äôt realize big San Antonio doesn‚Äôt sky scrapers. Omg üòÖ still crazy around time last year (NBA suspended, Trump's stupid rant, School closures) hopeless. year, 3 working vaccines preparing normal summer! following recommendations basically every doctor. Yes. Frankly sounds like reporting lag administration lag me. much higher average administration lag might say find unbelievable. likely die it. vaccine isn‚Äôt reward punishment. Misleading title. still eligibility requirements.

You fly bush plane 150 miles nearest provider wrestle bear guarding shots. thinks government tricking us grab power something claims like cold flu. least that‚Äôs current thinking. masks pussies. everyone wore masks without question, stopped partying like idiots, would big situation. literally basic multiplication. hoping Israel ends outlier case rate despite high % vaccinations. Also hope drops soon, meandering down. Hire fucking army next Bezos! Eh, think we‚Äôre getting close point outlook needlessly overcautious. month two ago would wholeheartedly agreed you. Saying vaccine reaches ""full effect"" exactly describing. think overreaching bit messaging angle here, offense. Also, we're better advising people strongly hold 15 days, versus strong enough messaging.


""Wait 15 days"" actionable thing.

""You gaining bit immunity day full effect day 15"" really likely confuse people tell act info, even accuracy higher. 14 days point vaccine placebo group data points began diverge. noticeable difference that. Therefore, think it‚Äôs safe assume protection 14 days, safe assume ‚Äúa lot.‚Äù Varying sources data suggest 4 week mark protection could high 92%, though necessarily.

Edit: diverge, converge plants plentiful manufacturers choice, come produce little ? chance already Covid? ask I've read people have, first shot one really kicks ass. 

If not, maybe reach GP? keep saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs going ramp up, it‚Äôs going ramp up.‚Äù Still slow balls Dear European Regulators Public: Look UK. vaccinated millions hardly issues great results. Truly stellar product. 

Dear AZ: deliver vaccines promised EU. 30 100 per cent? broad range inspire much confidence study. dont think people anymore. rather dont want it. think numbers going surge, nothing happen legislatively. Yeah apparently 458k total j&amp;j administered despite 3.6M delivered 30 100% big UK study, published British Medical Journal Wednesday, infection new variant led 227 deaths sample 54,906 COVID-19 patients, compared 141 among number patients infected ability spread rapidly, makes B.1.1.7 threat taken seriously,"" said Robert Challen, researcher Exeter University co-led research. I'm going hire Eastern European wet nurse who's vaccinated. shock case either different measure used misremembered. say yes would cases (assuming indeed widely drunk then)

My understanding always close two countries particular one issues London always faced disease becoming critical around numbers. Anyone wanting get vaccinated eligibility still restricted might want check local organizations performing vaccinations see they're offering appointments extra/unused doses.

Where live, organizations vaccinations daily ""extra"" appointments encouraging people group sign dose wasted. read really matter tbh. 2 weeks dose one already get like 85% effectiveness.

people worrying much tiniest details. make analogy completely fucking disconnected reality like fairytale anything else.

The EU's contract signed 6 months ago now. According dumb little story, that's enough, yet AZ still managed give 10% order. care blame shove onto EU, single second try convince AZ reliable company. First thing came mind lol imagine problem right much vaccination centers open, quite testimonials sub senior citizens still unable get shot, demand age group certainly still there, need expand people involved get vaccinated.

The USA getting 4 million day, least 3 million average second really low day CA vaccinations row. 137K doses. Wonder what's up. I'm saying good idea frankly complete total guess, wonder pharmacies administration sites could address saying ""If show past appointment hours thawed doses went unused, we'll give you."" people get could second dose scheduled there. could introduce problems I'm wondering direct broadly planned use unused doses could help. also depends lot area state. grandparents rural northern WI fully vaccinated wife's grandma near Madison could get first shot. Pennsylvania one biggest snowstorms record early February 2-3 feet snow many areas.

Vaccine appointments got delayed days otherwise business usual. ""American big pharma"". world's leading vaccine developed European company. need now.

You'll wait turn. Stay locked forever buddy. Can't find links English now, Google translate work (vaccines change (PM's comments) change fact get per capita theyre ahead everyone else? shouldnt state start getting less two reasons distribution numbers lot harder find. 

We see 80-90M month march, would distribution average ~4M per day. still lagging bit administration, since 7 day moving average less that, lot JnJ administraered last week. 

It big deal today, continues lag next week screaming it. explain mean reported efficacy 4 weeks post-inoculation. likely way early, antibody levels peak 50 days

That's rule. 4 weeks efficacy first shot plateuing. Pfizer data Israel showed that. case, that's data have, general rule, usually take 4 weeks efficacy approach peak. That's definitely impression viral vector vaccine publications 2-dose trial also spacing shots 8 weeks, 12 weeks. 

Didn't know that. read somewhere 12 weeks. Okay. They're still postponing second dose see viral vector 2nd dose early Oxford vaccine actually LOWERED efficacy (55%

That's actually really weird. AZ's results amd cohorts broken many variables statistically significant enough. 

Given results AZ, second dose even 12 weeks barely effect right *assume* *expect* second dose JnJ one much effect. Maybe even reason opted one dose regimen begin with. all, Sputnik V praised design reason. AstraZeneca agreed examine using one Sputnik V's shots second dose reason (or first dose, think). reality viral vector vaccines. Ohio drops 50 tomorrow Went mall days ago. Nobody gives shit, full everywhere. Hope dont get covid. *cough* Yes, delivered late only. They're play yet. Tell Ireland melt. nobody ever died 4 days taking vaccine could immortal taking vaccine every day. Whoa Black two antibodies, bamlanivimab etesevimab Probably novavax first. Mexico seconds this. Essentially, yes. that's thing restrictions - they're lifted, there's going rise ""risky"" behavior caused restrictions first place. Maybe dealing virus easily transmissible it'd one thing, consider much COVID spreads households workplace environments, think parties large gatherings world impacted length restrictions use PPO. past, DoI considered guiding parameter Constitution. But, one look Preamble Constitution find secures right liberty:

""""We People United States, Order form perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide common defense, promote general Welfare, secure Blessings Liberty Posterity, ordain establish Constitution United States America.""

And, right liberty less important right protest go church. fundamental right violated government, court's view said violations strict scrutiny. Thus, court finds law infringes fundamental constitutional right, may apply strict scrutiny standard nevertheless hold law policy constitutionally valid government demonstrate court law regulation necessary achieve ""compelling state interest"". government must also demonstrate law ""narrowly tailored"" achieve compelling purpose, uses ""least restrictive means"" achieve purpose. Failure show conditions may result judge striking law unconstitutional.*

As law students know court uses strict scrutiny language decision, almost assuredly means court strike law. Court's rarely finds instances government compelling state interest narrow tailored law fit state interest likely less restrictive means achieve purpose.

*I fully admit pulled Wiki lazy type answer. Good theory I‚Äôll look instead know you‚Äôre right. think Florida, media reports problems hic ups much creates impression much incompetence vaccine trickling out. understand trying make analogy. think relevant analogy discussion hand. 

Who Canada analogy? got pneumonia vaccine earlier year. arm literally fell staple back on. 

Not really, sore could move 1 week. said, beat pneumonia twice past 2 years. point 4 million lot Pfizer produce, regardless going. Much deal Alaska tribal health organizations get vaccine allotments regardless goes state level, they've well prepared received distribute population far largest native component state. Mississippi it‚Äôs Wild West. Smoking pre existing condition everybody know smoked last 3 years trying get one. got first got asked zero questions anything free boot. think important note California data latency issues updating past two/three days counts probably short couple hundred thousand. Still indicative need lower limits something keep mind. guess i'm nihilist think actions impact virus i.e. town social distance bubble. someone traveled gotten infected half town would gotten it. There‚Äôs nothing far I‚Äôm aware. experience it‚Äôs best get shot non dominant arm. Tbh it‚Äôs barely last Wednesday. 1.9M vs 2.0M

Supply increasing exponentially. 

What going take administration keep up? Link?  depends entirely state, think we'll see lower next week. Alaska already lowered *sixteen,* couple states recently lowered either fifty fifty-five. sad see gap, needs motivate addressed. really are. It‚Äôs exciting! üòÄ curious getting less, curious desantis's donors got first  really meant *may* rather ""oh shit look what's happening next"".

You would think people would know Fauci better now, listen fucking guy. Wisconsinite here. know decent amount nurses got vaccine. mom (a teacher) 56 got first shot last week. dad 58 (factory worker) getting first shot Friday. finally see light end tunnel. Except requirement older 16... Seriously, headline writers, even stop moment consider written? disagree. 1% rise 65+ group 0.25% rise total population. would take 400 days well year administer single shot everyone rate. need 100 day range. resurge begins. /s Fairbanks fine too. larger towns road system probably are.

Ping might issue fast-paced FPS gaming something, otherwise fine. cool story, bro Ariana Grande released song called 7 Rings give excuse make 7 reasons! 
/s there, quick google. cleared 275,000 waiting list month, total population county 1 million. 230,000 young vaccine looking knocking 33% eligible people month counting anyone vaccinated i'll say pretty much moot point whether get group week open things days almost definitely correlation factor, likely age. kids even authorized take vaccines yet, federal allocation vaccine doses based state's adult population rather total population, means state minors receive smaller share vaccines ratio total population state adults. Colder states tend northern, northern states tend older (fewer parent-aged residents) smaller family sizes. would look % population least one dose instead % total population see much changes calculation. Exactly. media report? ""'Jaw dropping' increase: 17% died NC 2020 2019.""

The media LOVES bad news. generates way clicks good news. didn‚Äôt care mild covid, long covid, small real risk genetically vulnerable, wouldn‚Äôt altered life much last year. 

The unstated assumption CDC guidance vaccinated unvaccinated hang maskless indoors it‚Äôs ok low risk people risk contracting covid data risk vaccinated continues gathered. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt advise high risk unvaccinated people same. don‚Äôt data yet. 

I intention letting guard now, especially vaccine close. 

A little loneliness isn‚Äôt fatal, know. I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôll continue wait. 

It nice hear leader speak enduring something difficult. never heard message American (certainly last guy ran county!). Both. Neither released US results yet. democrat governor WI there's also shortage cities (that vote blue) compared rural areas. think fair assume governor favoring rural people political reasons via vaccine distribution. seems common across least handful states regardless governor. variants learning becoming resistant vaccines /s Well that's Pfizer. Two separate vaccines different recommendations. certainly wish lived now. again, lived 10 years awesome, vaccine. Cope harder buddy. And? true still wouldn‚Äôt relevant That‚Äôs interesting know, I‚Äôm going check update info accordingly. Baltimore Sun (a week ago) stated slightly less quarter 2 million people currently eligible (phases 1a&amp;1b) vaccinated/received first dose. Numbers POC abysmal comparatively. info MD 42ndish probably outdated point. Looking PA rollout website look like ""free-for-all"" sense mean they've losing fathers covid whats difference? dad left never came back lol /s (just joke hurt me)  Wanting something happen =/= reality. EU signed contract AZ warranted obligations 3rd parties would interfere performance contract. Clearly complete misrepresentation. wait social media shortens ""PC""

""Oh yeah last time went 2 PC.""

""What?""

""Oh that's year 2018 Gregorian calendar"" open vaccination sites, sure. saw two people walking parents‚Äô neighborhood like weekend. live PA suburbs, NYC you‚Äôd expect sidewalk congestion. I've read people getting leftover Pfizer Moderna vaccines end night would wasted otherwise

However, tried ton people hunting leftover vaccines place like CVS may like 10 doses leftover closing time

I've also read prioritize age, I'm 20s Super Bowl 100% capacity though it? one game, course says opening day implication it'll more, right? (Before get downvoted i'm arguing against, think they're situation unless i'm missing something) Still getting flexed UK though How'd get unnatural tan? Nope. fake news. Try again. time switch full throttle states soon become possibility JJ shipments arrive. 100% vaccination vulnerable community goal folks choosing pass getting shot. SF doesn‚Äôt outdoor mandate, though you‚Äôre going see someone outside without mask them. It‚Äôs voluntary fully immunized always best protection speak spanish, it: goes preliminary data study.
Which networks paid gov't said false fake news. 5 days ago.
NOW, UPCH gov't confirm data. Anjali Ramkissoon never got arrested expect to. 40,000 fans allowed opening day April 5th Seems right tbh customer, one without exclusivity priority, late game.

The EU signed AZ contract day UK ‚Äì EU signed APA 27 August 2020, UK signed Supply Agreement AZD1222 28 August 2020. 

If going argue ""Sure, UK entered negotiations earlier"" ‚Äì maybe yes, maybe no. EU contract happen day either. going go ""but UK funded AZ plants soil"" ‚Äì yeah, sure. AZ already manufacturing capacity EU, like start-up requires funding, they're multinational pharma company billions dollars revenue ‚Äì anyway, contract EU pretty much says doses delivered loss AZ, meaning EU willing cover unexpected additional costs.

If going argue EU contract based ""best efforts"" ‚Äì UK contract. contain language.

The payment terms redacted UK contract, know fact EU paid nearly $400 million doses, including 66% within first 5 days signing contract ensure stockpiling. also know AZ promised delivery 80 million doses end Q1, applied late approval, approval happened cut initial delivery plan 31 million, fail deliver even that.

And yeah, EU customer. AZ got money advance producing vaccine delivered given date, ""best reasonable efforts"" clause says supposed whatever company size, standing, position, similar assets would situation. Meaning - buy SII outsource production deliver paid for.

It mean cross arms claim ""guys, we're really trying, problems"" ‚Äì problems stockpiling 50 million doses US, even approve vaccine‚Ä¶ 90+ million doses administered US alone. Yes, sometimes someone going die getting vaccine. someone might die watching TV. don‚Äôt know vaccine cause yet case, even extremely rare. pretty common, no? live North Dakota, we're like too. true two weeks ago well, things going significantly faster. think that. speak Missouri I'm here, look map vaccines available: areas around Kansas City locations appointments available, typically swooped quickly. St. Louis essentially none. rural areas there's available appointments. there's available appointments, there's LOT available appointments. Take instance Walmart Mount Vernon, MO. Here's available appointment list there: essentially time slots available day. urban areas like KC STL bare bones shots available filling slots. 

The state needs a) Open anyone get shot and/or b) Re-allocate location shots places used entirely. 

It's really frustrating see could drive 1.5 hours Chillicothe get shot tomorrow tier, I'm restricted going filling slots. Frankly, all-vaccinated hotel staff extremely appealing thing marketing, might kickstart small-scale travel. Anjali Ramkissoon never was. There's differences New Zealand United States. hard time putting finger though.

Not one county United States needed ""appropriately lock down."" here, free individuals government power tell us stay home.

I agree 90% could avoided. Hell 100% could avoided locked all. ""Professionals"" get make decisions public policy considerably complicated *only* focusing getting people sick.

Virologists wish tell public need run office. Mom, Sister, got Pfizer. felt nothing first shot, felt nothing second, got rocked every side effect unfortunately lol. let stop getting though, obviously worth obviously happen everyone real?! don‚Äôt believe this. 

I live left leaning, heavily masked/distanced area. 

Even then, coworkers see every weeks, distance 3 minutes naturally go back regular human interaction - close convos, loud laughs, hugs, etc. safety officer separate us LMAO. 

Social interaction must distancing/masks doesn‚Äôt count. else would them? Let sit shelf expire get thrown away practical option (practical - rule shipping aliens, reworking 5g chips, absurdness might come with)

If conspiracy theories, try big global business wants slaves keep working. (this spun kinds ways, tried pick one worse ones) made USA? *American* company headquartered Manhattan guess cfr largely dependant countries testing. part sucks.  Hey! That's pretty inaccurate, we've working hard online schooling point burnout, we're happy continue learning like since beginning this, back campus time. make assumptions intelligence ü•∞ Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's fair. guess clarified instances still concluded vaccine played role. 

Here's something CDC's website: ""Over 92 million doses COVID-19 vaccines administered United States December 14, 2020, March 8, 2021. time, VAERS received 1,637 reports death (0.0018%) among people received COVID-19 vaccine. CDC FDA physicians review case report death soon notified CDC requests medical records assess reports. **A review available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, medical records revealed no¬†evidence vaccination contributed patient deaths.**¬†CDC FDA continue investigate reports adverse events, including deaths, reported VAERS.""

I guess understand actually conclude vaccine played role, especially younger supposedly healthy adults. seems easy point coincidence elderly frail population, seems less likely younger groups. I've got tickets two festivals September, one Virginia one Alabama! seeing posters hearing organizers commit events unless something really crazy happens almost enough make cry. fully expect Pennsylvania one last 10 states even switch *next* tier eligibility. Let alone remove eligibility requirements.

I appreciate governor administration taken coronavirus pandemic seriously. MANY criticisms decision making along way. Vaccine roll distribution pile critiques. science, absolutes. definitely say drinking water won‚Äôt kill two days later?

However, clinical trials showed death rate placebo vaccine groups fairly similar. also compare general mortality rate public mortality rates vaccinated people. Again, give evidence vaccines don‚Äôt increase deaths, individual‚Äôs death definitely caused vaccine. There‚Äôs good argument made US awful COVID spread, able gauge effectiveness vaccines faster, thus, approve release faster. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fair ‚Äî basically think there‚Äôs way fairly. definitely feels unfair healthy 20 year old AK get vaccinated 64 year grocery store worker heart disease WA still waiting. 

But always going winners losers. don‚Äôt see way perfectly balance limited supply miracle drug insane demand. 

The thing irritates one acknowledging difference allocations media coverage. People feel like state screwing state distribute actually have. guess find something else autopsy happened anyone else millions already gotten vaccine?

I remember reading similar case doctor fell ill got second dose. guess case still investigation. Twitter full grifters. Doesn‚Äôt surprise least. people‚Äôs rhetoric done massive damage people‚Äôs mental health overall view deadly Covid really (especially children) There's scandal going on. Corruption people involved politics charge conducting trial given money China gave 3 doses sinopharm's news reporter got preliminary data vaccine efficacy Sinopharm's everyone called fake news. Then, head responsible trial said true

I'm going translate you:
Esto luego de que un programa local se√±alara que, seg√∫n el estudio de la Universidad Cayetano Heredia de la San Marcos, la vacuna de la cepa de Wuhan tiene solo el 33% de eficacia la vacuna de la cepa de Beijing tiene el 11.5%.

This commentary local news station reporter that, according Cayetano Heredia University's San Marcos' vaccine study, inactivated Wuhan strain 33% inactivated Beijing strain 11%(which actually way around).

Then, public health ministers congressmen, already received vaccine back September, said fake, head clinical study said that, Universidad Privada Cayetano Heredia, UPCH, showed results ""fake news"" politicians claimed, fact there's bombshell people charge study knew low efficacy third dose early end much, whole thing corruption. Sinopharm's chinese embassador served agent sell vaccine Peru hired media prop up. Peru spent $40 per dose, paying peruvian gov't people charge trial secure think slowdown CA holding back 50% doses special groups instead giving whoever wants first come first ser e nice.  Good, since Georgia one lowest administration rates Louisiana opened anyone 16+ BMI 25 former smokers (essential personnel, teachers, healthcare, etc. vaxxed Jan February). massive free-for-all yesterday announcement since basically includes everyone. know single person doesn‚Äôt one dose appointment get one.

They done excellent job containing one serious initial outbreaks, getting back normal safely, vaccine distribution. element first come, first served based sign go New variants showed late final vaccine mass trials , result extreme evolutionary pressure virus always result , virus gets deadly younger people , deal ethical dilemma ? may saved old ones dying huge cost young ones , especially poorer countries vaccines years come ? think op means would sell vaccines instead giving Grim aggressively wrong! Trying definitively say anything makes sense since haven‚Äôt done autopsy yet. Getting first shot later tonight. Really looking forward course, time covid already seems like first shot really kicks ass already Jesus. argument correct forgetting fact people still wearing masks. talking isolation lockdown all. live Hotspot ride bus everyone wears one, fucking brainless. work, managers constantly berating employees removing masks respecting social distancing, happens everywhere still.

Mid 70's imaginable. 80% well. That's I'm saying. 

4 weeks definitely enough. 50 days really excessive. JnJ opted 4 weeks read-out time reason. can't say Pfizer plateaued 4 weeks apply J&amp;J

I cited example. stated 4 weeks enough general, viral vector lowering efficacy booster early weird all. makes total sense take account vector resistance

It üòÖüòÇ. really doesn't. Makes immunological sense. Probably CI thing. seems like mixing numbers initial AZ data recent, well numbers J&amp;J AZ.

I'm really not. days vs 28 days J&amp;J

You're assuming efficacy AZ improved period time. reason assume that. reason waited 12 weeks efficacy could improve, rather wait anti-ChAd immunity subside, even 12 weeks still major issue, obviously. Also, report efficacy 76% *after* 90 days, period 24 (I think??) 90 days. people really need understand people cutting line ""necessarily"" bad, comes Public Health. doubt, give shot.  scheduled first vaccine Saturday! can't believe year ago stress-reading subreddit. :') take hospital bed?

It would make sense test participants initial trial, since time interval two doses regular people wil huge. case, needs tested long interval. likely show increased efficacy

That's speculation. testing 12 week interval (within one real world get second dose.......). tells designing study similarly AstraZeneca. AZ's second dose increases efficacy % points (76 81%). Ramasay et al mentions idea immunity vectors reason second dose's low efficacy. likely happen JnJ well, because, like AZ, second dose would use exact vector first dose. We're lucky multiple vaccines compare data design. Sputnik V uses two different vectors efficacy 92%. doses given 3 weeks apart. AZ JnJ likely opted 12 week regimen precisely immunity vectors - goes away (to small degree) 12 weeks. deaths drop 100 per day, roughly rate flu. still take precautions flu, don‚Äôt stop living. think that‚Äôs turning point. think approved *yet*.

That's lot weight lost! least requirements expanding quickly, might still get vaccine sooner rather later. dude tone like exact reason people make big deal masks

like, can‚Äôt hear people we‚Äôre outside cause they‚Äôre voice muffled. seeing facial expressions weird hell.

You rapidly reduce duration tiers one thing people take respond. 

It's interesting problem mathematically want tier become idle. 

Note though we're moving fast ANYWAY covid able rebound shorter window might matter. 

My thinking subject one large tier front line workers, anyone medical issues, 50 up, open everyone. don‚Äôt argue this. agree disagree. good one stay safe blocking export vaccine US vacinated.  Well they're smart know better us yokels i'm sure lol


/s getting tested pre flight? Ah *with* masks. Texas. call allowing export vaccines everyone US vaccines, even though manufacturers contracts many different countries? 

Would say EU blocked exports vaccines EU vacintatione ban? 

The way see US selfish time world needs come together hole vacinate country.  northern us power grid knocked off, Canadian provinces ban exports make sure provinces power regardless contracts?   9-11 Canada rejected flights blocked landing US crash instead? get mentality here. I‚Äôve Moderna shots. made arm hurt enough wince tried raise yelp husband accidentally touched it. couldn‚Äôt sleep side like usually do. Hot showers rice packs put microwave helped ton. Moving much helps. drove home left arm usually drive right, etc. problem sit sleep. can‚Äôt move constantly hurt it‚Äôs still while. 12-18 hours shot worst probably, everyone know nearly back normal 24-36 hours later. got mine Friday fine Sunday. 

The fever, chills, body aches worse though! don‚Äôt last long suck happen. ready stuff place make feel better work much. we're talking people skeptical vaccine, every right leaning rural pastor keep mouth shut too?

Honestly, yes. think every public figure role model acts ways promote vaccine hesitancy deeply irresponsible. want really say anything specific LeBron sort *racial ambassador* know fair him, disappointed using power public figure encourage vaccine uptake hope changes mind. Well ate wife's leftover pizza saved lunch next day...my life definitely risk! Remember two months ago. Early January finally starting come insane surge US. Vaccines healthcare workers nursing homes complete mess. hoping American adults vaccinated fall.

Just two months later cases plummeting. hitting record vaccine numbers. 18% US population received dose. first state opened vaccines general population. enough doses US adults end May.

Think life like two months now. think summer. üòä question getting many shipments rest us want need them?

Hmm okay. still ""corrected"" second dose likely increase efficacy. Wanna talk that? üòÇ interesting topic. doses produced UK go UK? It‚Äôs gotten point hate game stopped playing.

Guarantee you‚Äôll see packed clubs, live concerts, large gatherings, crowded restaurants, etc. Even looked Atlanta last week nightclub hundreds people jammed there. could side effect two minority lower life expectancy thus lower representation group eligible vaccine. Sounds like personal problem Ya gotta love year ""hahaha stupid fucking Americans"" rest world failing vaccines ""pwease gib us vaccine"" someone extremely cautious entire pandemic, tell two weeks receive second dose (or first shot J&amp;J), pandemic me. expect true anyone like me. 

Don't get wrong, I'll still wear masks long mandates place, I'm going things year - see friends/family, travel, dine indoors, go comedy shows, etc. dont understand mentality.

new zealand appropriately locks entire regions single case detected. outside occasional lock every couple months, nz basically back normal. 

if nations responded appropriately, might similar positions. everyone worried economic failure, we're juggling record excess mortality debilitating economic downturn. 

the whole idea following guidelines stifle infections harmful unnecessary terrible position. 

strange anyone would still wanna die hill. shut schools swine flu

Only 700 130,000 schools closed swine infection flu lot rarer covid

We know time, kept vast majority schools open anyways. It‚Äôs lax - system is. It‚Äôs (criterion) strict people know 1c yet many already vaccinated many signed be. 

My state still 1b. 

Thats problem criterion- opposite fact. sign systems hot mess. timing eligibility, could said get later. needed talk publicist first, maybe done *before* asked knew going come up. Vaccines started administered *December* all, he's plenty time think come response. think would prevented saying something like this? ""I plan receive vaccine months available me. plan jump line front Americans deserve much do. encourage everyone get vaccinated soon eligible.""

Almost assuredly, prevented saying either still fence getting vaccine right now, already decided plan getting it, either way encouraging people get it, even ask doctor advice. basically response got elderly neighbor offered help sign open vaccination appointments - ""Oh still think over."" Month half later, still gotten despite ample opportunity. want to, want argue get judged it. Which, fine, I'm sad putting risk private mostly anonymous citizen make decisions, I'm going respect private matters I'm *not* going judge argue her. person LeBron is, person LeBron said wants past. way create demand new antibiotics overuse ones stop making inexpensive ones still work. documented cases people developing severe disease dying covid receiving vaccine? want put warning context. initial point (in first post) people need rushing get vaccine top J&amp;J dose ENSEMBLE II coming.

So puts us place: People going rushing get dose (or two doses) vaccine received first dose J&amp;J. would hold laminating cards since couple extra spaces vaccine doses. feeling reserved potential booster doses  Classic line  Jansen developer medicine EU based. J&amp;J owner company UK expert ban. tiny production capacity small order enough use capacity. doses export they've bought. Again, doesn‚Äôt include JNJ vaccinations Back plans fine. EU using back plans since AZ offered third expected doses.... add division already divided country.  Goodness check literally none boxes lol Sure, Maryland 28th distribution 30th terms efficiency, putting ranks national average (18.3% 1st dose 79% usage). higher EU average (about 9.6%) still woefully insufficient distribution need prevent spread. probably need double (\~40% vaccine coverage), bearing mind vaccines less useful South African variant UK variant transmissible. couple weeks restrictions could difference 4th wave near elimination cases. Worried that, it'll worth long run. Luckily work home take breaks/naps/work bed necessary. I've seen chart vaccine effectiveness compared placebo groups somewhere. basically probability getting infected time, vaccinated group flattened around 10 days first shot.

I can't find chart now, can't remember shot was, frustrating. saw /r/covidvaccinated like month ago. high, means test pick much viral matter. video worth watching, even though 14 minutes long. New Yorker continuing quarantine good news vaccines coming in, seriously wondering ""vaccine tourism"" thing. Well anecdotal evidence one time meal without social distancing really proves country opened back completely. risk low absolute terms groups, relative terms, much higher 35-50 20-35.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* untruthful. They‚Äôre manipulating statistics. It‚Äôs hopium, it‚Äôs blatantly misleading. Per NYT cases 14 percent hospitalizations 39 percent 14 days like anxiety disorder

Yes, is. However, many people current day like (probably due social media) isolated problem. ""Removing mask mandates"" mean things normal again. live South we're anywhere close anything pre-pandemic. Exactly. Since becoming apparent badly government handled vaccine rollout, i's turning blame game. First, tried putting focus biontech, claiming demanded much money, lead prolonged negotiations. act like want AZ, reality people simply gotten chance yet EU countries also still shit tons sat storage still, even vaccines help much took jerrrrrrrbsssss!! Fauci attention-whoring borderline criminal liar.  whole career.

We're tail end typical Gompertz derivative function epidemiological curve. exact 'plateauing' right predicted three months ago part every single normal epidemiological statistical trend dating back many Tuesday urged Americans wear masks, socially distance get vaccinated, saying virus cannot mutate can‚Äôt infect hosts replicate.

ORLY?

Lot assumptions conflict current CDC guidance, Tony.  also dropped similar amount everywhere world time, even Canada 5% vaccinated. works keep prioritized patients ahead age groups. Look what‚Äôs going Maine right see flaws age only. you‚Äôre 40s syndrome, much higher mortality rate someone 60s. Maine cut priorities age. new rules take effect today Merica First, thought Trump thing ... Make damn mind new rules take effect today like 90% peak effectiveness 10 days first shot. technically reach peak effectiveness 15 days second shot, last 10% significant first 90%. üòÇ I'm really thinking people incredibly anxious even feel comfortable right seeing people vaccinated even (and lot people like this).

This thinking pretty extreme sounds like anxiety disorder me, reason two fully vaccinated people feel unsafe visiting other. remember like Ebola 50% cases end death. virus deadly elderly much generally healthy younger person. Covid elimination globally unlikely, think many people adjusted attitudes strategies accordingly.  still seeing sharp drop cases? rescind takes effect today mean, time beginning vaccinate people loosening reatrictions time new good variants so..... What‚Äôs excuse Hispanic communities? always get lumped black community articles like this, despite different cultures different histories, etc. items/blue shells absolutely ruin Mario Kart 8. I‚Äôm trying get gold trophy 150cc races one god race every fucking time get hit back back shells right crossing finish line come 2nd. It‚Äôs gotten point hate game stopped playing. 

So quite achievement deserve congratulations. Herd immunity require 100%. enough infected person unlikely encounter someone immune therefore can't spread it. representative. state line old folks call call back make appointment think experience outdated. days swab outermost part nose, lineups typically short states. Don‚Äôt worry much it. Unless professional baseball player, it‚Äôs bad. Honestly, unpleasant, debilitating. might diplomacy shots going places can‚Äôt afford vaccines coming short supply. Americans (kids, example) get opportunity vaccinated.

Biden already said administration help Americans chance. [Have look pharma jobs increasing steadily Europe. Source that?  fast chills come? small data dump Minnesota yesterday too. 1000 cases 138 deaths backlogged. Talk state?

How one go that? rapidly approve vaccine use kids, 100M doses would useful fall school year. would least calm people insist never send kids back school.  thought too! sounded like 100 million part total due June. sounds like backlog kids come September. vast majority Covid cases always produced mild symptoms, especially young healthy people. experiencing exactly expect experience. issue pandemic exactly that, pandemic. Even 5% people get ill that's 15 million Americans hospitalized everyone got it.

You individual, rest pretty certain flu symptoms. I've resigned fact deaths COVID-19 variants inevitability (although strongly believe we'll ability develop boosters decrease rates severe disease death), faith testing contact tracing efforts bring spread. faith international community control spread therefore mutations.

Basically: **will** spread, **will** mutate, we'd either government measures indefinitely, closed borders indefinitely, significantly ramped testing tracing infrastructure, etc. think feasible even guarantee.

I'm walking logically year making progress, outside vaccine front. think lot people 50 (most vulnerable) still trying get April think fair open everyone get shots.

And, arbitrary restrictions exactly Dec Feb working really well highest risk hospitalization death. counterproductive all. Normal return country residents ample opportunity fully vaccinated either accepted declined offer. happened, little risk hospital overloads even disease spreads unchecked among unvaccinated, vulnerable protected vaccines.

The US projected enough vaccine everyone end May. Add six weeks take effect looking sometime July. six members extended family local, three shots two us one. again, false.

They allowing Pfizer Moderna (and J&amp;J) sell doses ordered US highest bidder, thing all. Second dose ass couple days. think vaccines available we‚Äôll things organized vaccinated people couple months, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get CDC declare victory. They‚Äôll stop talking it. strong educational gap two parties, lol. Isnt old news like week ago? Really nicely done. Pause video mouse-hover protein interactions.

The operation spike protein truly awesome. NZ AU several things common. Small populations. islands. cut travel out. display massive differences countries- wasn‚Äôt lockdown helped control virus. Funny deleted earlier post made identical story.

The numbers headline misleading rolling average two weeks goes back include days low reporting Texas deep freeze. Everything delayed including testing snd reporting. call allowing export vaccines everyone US vaccines, even though manufacturers contracts many different countries?

I'd call misinformation. Executive Order say vaccines exported, says vaccines ordered US cannot sold countries (to highest bidder example). contractual obligation, ban. 

Nothing ED forbids, bans, disallows Pfizer Moderna expand capacities US sell countries long maintain contractual obligations US. say EU blocked exports vaccines EU vacintatione ban?

That's different US done. way see US selfish time world needs come together hole vacinate country. northern us power grid knocked off, Canadian provinces ban exports make sure provinces power regardless contracts? 9-11 Canada rejected flights blocked landing US crash instead? get mentality here.

Canada done exact thing accusing US regards vaccines, guilt-tripping tactics work here. take COVAX vaccines, share doses every Canadian inoculated: na√Øve hurts. a) moderns?

b) people like lie? CDC talking about. advise eat fast food month MAX, never smoke, one drink per day, billion pieces health advice one follows. sent unfriendly country improve relations? mom got Pfizer couldn‚Äôt lift arm much days. dad got moderna couldn‚Äôt feel thing. amount movement general. Enough doses _available_ _end_ May. still need wait month second dose. couple weeks take full effect. 4 Best effort clauses there, secret biological process risky. Nah fuck em, saying much hype ‚Äústory‚Äù . Hum yes can.  us banned export vaccines even though contracts signed. Restrictions sufficient keep infections level early December mid-February, British variant become dominant existing restrictions enough more. Good. vaccines use ?? telling people handle health.

This sub hive seems obsessed demanding people forego personal health favor collective. never said don‚Äôt get J&amp;J vaccine, said *I* didn‚Äôt want J&amp;J vaccine citing concerns long-term effects got called anti-science, anti-vax, selfish, stupid, sorts crap. don‚Äôt give shit you‚Äôre dying go concert, take care body first. 
 
After made appointment, found getting Pfizer kept it. J&amp;J, would‚Äôve cancelled gotten another eventually. got first dose, I‚Äôm happy. Reddit argument. Throw numbers zero relation question. kids going bumbling morons given year half vacation  State Texas simply gave authority mandate masks county city governments. bad thing? Dallas City Hall OCP headquarters RoboCop. they'd rather vaccinate people ""wrong"" people? seems wrong. turn away ineligible people door. 

California obsessed ""fairness"" counter productive times. Even name program ""My Turn"" patronizing. I'm pretty anti-government, I'd rather local government enforce mask mandate state federal government.

The people see upset government simps want state federal government usurp power local governments dictates. They're pissed broad government imposing local governments. Anywhere colonized history slavery. Also, Oregon suppose state white utopia. Sundown towns everywhere. Jim Crow laws practiced almost every state. southern ones. Connecticut rich history racism. south. us blocked contracts full filled Canada. I‚Äôm province 50 new cases per day situation isn‚Äôt dire, 20 million doses would cover adult population 8 million soon 

The shitty part slaying second doses vaccines 4 months everyone get first doses faster.  

If surplus 30 million doses injected make 5 million available here?  us border open till canad second dose figure. 

It would buy lot goodwill past 4 years multiple frivolous trade wars. described situation. Everyone opinion, many dead permanent damaged health accept.
But worry much Germany. country survived worse month lockdown.

The thing is, virus care feelings, tired bored are. make decisions, feel enough must move on, pandemic end. easily get way worse. I'm hard bad things keeps happening. understand I‚Äôm feeling you. I‚Äôm German US haven‚Äôt seen family member since 14 months. miss nephews birth won‚Äôt able see 1st birthday. Visiting might feasible another months, especially since brother wife won‚Äôt vaccinated fall, still wouldn‚Äôt risk transmitting covid even vaccinated earlier. I‚Äôm happy vaccines get approved, production ramps up, countries see continuously increasing numbers daily vaccinations. spring coming parallel, it‚Äôs gonna get better on. know bolded quote designed show control appropriate  

Why can't fucking people admit wrong? Science worthless people. goddamn chickenshit cowards. wonder ban everyone disagree with. rationalize noncompliance simple act covering orifices face  

You're wrong. science prove now. never public health. scare ""compliance."" people try frighten others making self-destructive decisions. 

And scientifically proven wrong. zero new info this. Clickbait - bother.

O'Roak stressed even virus variants, current research suggests COVID-19 vaccine still effective preventing severe cases disease death. health officials strive achieve herd immunity, O‚ÄôRoak said important takeaway recent discoveries importance staying course, following COVID-19 safety protocols including wearing masks public.  counties Texas continuing mask mandates already. see Abbott lifting state mandate big deal. he's done give power local governments. bad?

Look, somebody says Trump sole reason covid deaths US, that's course true. countries failed deal covid US different president would probably still great. also true say every country equally bad government's Trump's actions matter. huge differences countries lot comes actions governments. way Trump dealt (or rather didn't) problem really reprehensible certainly made situation US worse. countries well covid countries took seriously right beginning. tested lot, intensive tracing, mandated mask wearing limited high risk activities. contrast look Trump did. said many times problem disappear. US luxury covid started spreading later Asia Europe use advantage all. slow ramping testing, slow adapting mask wearing overall slow reacting. travel ban came point little effect since point covid spreading lot US. else Trump done? reason things end much worse actions state governments. 

Most European countries also failed, although think story bit different. big problem Europe countries interconnected, governed separately. Since EU little powers health care, response pandemics coordinated much across EU country acted individually. makes difficult contain disease, although countries still succeeded.

Germany opinion one countries dealt issue much better others, end still failed large extent. fare much better US though. 

Overall, would say Europe also underestimated problem spring fall second wave came. Last year, kids came back college spring break came back covid. Eastern TN, eg, hit it, near Greeneville, TN.

the vaccine takes 2-3 weeks post second shot effective

herd immunity magic number one ever gets sick again. see data chicken pox, example also important remain distance people wear masks even get vaccine reduce risk spreading even still.

Sorry, no. goes every study. Stupid question, dont much knowledge wondering dont symptoms like others, fever, cough anything except runny nose super sore throat. Btw it, went test. don‚Äôt understand huge spotlight Texas like isn‚Äôt 19 states without star wide mandates.

Yea think mostly agree this, already take account future allocations. planning ahead would need consider past performance also projected participation need/demand.

Since approved J&amp;J vax emergency use, estimate enough vaccines distribute americans end May, think planning future allocations change pretty drastically.

This means US bought priority... case needs it.

Every government deal allows defer even wave acceptance. US could simply strike deal another country take shipment.

# Vaccine row: EU exported 34m doses ‚Äì including 9m UK

 **Internal figures leaked amid tit-for-tat Boris Johnson claims UK export ban place** 

 total 34m doses coronavirus vaccine exported EU despite shortages people living bloc, including 9m sent UK 1m US, ban sales abroad. 

...

But officials said Michel wanted know many exports made UK highlighted role EU-based production sites global effort.

‚ÄúWe know different countries got different measures place ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt concern vaccines, far understand, coming UK,‚Äù commission spokesperson said. ‚ÄúBut know well we, EU, very, active exporter vaccines necessarily case partners.‚Äù

According latest figures seen Guardian accurate 9 March, 34,090,287 doses exported EU 31 countries, 9,106,162 went UK, 3,917,640 Canada, 3,134,204 Mexico, 2,720,210 Japan 1,368,900 Saudi Arabia. beneficiaries EU exports included Hong Kong (1.3m), Singapore (967,030), US (953,723), Chile (942,825) Malaysia (751,140).

The majority vaccines exported EU UK made Pfizer, distributes globally European production sites, understood. EU blocked one export request controversial authorisation mechanism vaccines, shipment 250,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses Italy Australia.

... feel bad daughter. thorough investigation needs completed. hospital, moderna well told would still get it. Likely asymptomatic spread others. something something variants vaccines significantly weaker Georgia letting people 16+ get vaccine beginning April 1. I'd u-turns booth like Boris Johnson slow bit better. issue measures politics know people nervous protect economy. hospitals Paris saturated externalize sick people China, removing nurses job ! ...and galaxy far away time far off, someone reference reliable sub source this. Come on, read r/Coronavirus, they're strict facts! Two weeks. two weeks-which 15 days, you‚Äôre considered fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm sure confusion coming from. like rewarding laziness making healthy people go even longer without able interact world. Merkel said today need expect three four though months vaccines start making difference. would put us early July, eight continuous months lockdown (or rather, restrictions everyday life beyond mask orders occupancy limits). I'm really talking people going houses dealing customers. finance telecom large backend infrastructure, people working offices coworkers. Managers offices etc. Thats issue, take issue trades excluded. think amount trades, home repair companies etc go dozen houses complete strangers every month, sometimes more. believe goes obese rather overweight. percent obese? hear spin-off Gilligan's Island theme song coming ... Weird Arent one states already lifted mask mandate though? pharmacies handicapped restrictions. example, CVS Virginia administer 65+ school teachers. state run ones people high risk individuals still impressive administered 90mil vs 23 mil, even higher population states need already Sad. Wonder highest single day deaths/capita biggest countries compares. read TX anyone 50+ eligible along 1a (medical staff) 1b (65+ 16+ health issues), Houston opened anyone requirements first heard, nice tho ia like Austin surrounding cities. make assumption, think would‚Äôve done better job? Thank you, good person  number beginning slow growth? hunch start creating 60s low 70s growth slow could wrong. 


Any insight? I'm sitting Switzerland, 1% population vaccinated. We've 1st phase since January. country 8 million people can't seem get shit together comes covid. Always late, always step behind. fact two different sources telling us two different times full vaccine efficacy. flip round another referendum rejoining EU know way I'd vote staunch remain. Oh Gosh. Heavens no. think it‚Äôs purely cultural discussion. Quite opposite. think significant barriers accessing quality healthcare primary explanation vaccination rates. 

You look health outcome blacks/Latinos underperform whites. cultural reason blacks Latinos would want treatment heart attacks cancer medical condition. Yet see communities poorer health outcomes. much bigger issue culture. largely access quality health care issue.  Honestly still pretty easy get appointment Georgia. I'm low risk got shot Walgreens looking people get it. proven safe real issue vaccine itself. doubt competence Russian scientists, although ethical concerns trials pushed through. 
 
The US export ban (or inability produce enough export) well EU's failure also produce enough giving Russia China huge geopolitical victory. Chile (Chinese vaccine) Serbia (SputnikV think) vaccinating much better pace EU countries. Hungary Slovakia also buying SputnikV, they're also able push ahead. great soft power western nations. 
 
I fault Hungary Slovakia going outside EU purchases get SputnikV, massive outbreaks EU failed deliver vaccines far. 
 
Without knowing enough, seems like Russia sacrifices citizens order get win though. pace vaccinating able produce enough internal use exports? far countries, giving least show better ally EU US. last part speculation part though. call ask.

Who‚Äôs they? fine one Moderna thrilled manage get Pfizer vaccine! Please - get vaccinated whichever one offered, soon available you.

I work local testing center full-time. yet offered vaccine. number people take seriously slap face. government relaxed restrictions today. Can't wait see we'll 14 days /s Moderna one two shots? fianc√©e deathly afraid needles (a nurse collapsed vein arm drawing blood really little) hoping get single dose vaccine.

Then, N98 arrives, use it. get 65% effective vaccine, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm vaccinated. don‚Äôt get sign 95% effective vaccine 3 months.  Wow.

The math much worse originally thought. propose two months worth weeks tests everyone cost approximately $68 per person.

So mere $13.5 billion dollar program.

Even money payable tomorrow, would (at generous) months get something like ground.

To say nothing massive amount resources logistics get done. Resources could better focused making, distributing, injecting vaccine. last sentence really accurate, least point chances higher 65% never get COVID. 65% effectiveness J&amp;J based getting COVID, decrease moderate severe cases. chances catching COVID still high depending environment variants exposed to. However, vaccine offers much higher protection level COVID infection stays asymptomatic less severe, good enough reason get it. also emerging evidence Israel UK vaccines also helps lower transmission become infected vaccine, probably due lower viral load. also good enough reason get vaccine hinders ability COVID spread community, helps us get back track normalcy. Twitter proper means report misinformation. shows Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine capable targeting key features South African variant. testing updated version vaccine insurance, current expectation needed.

And lyft banned her.

I Covid idiot registry. called head nurse. 



Sorry help it. RIP. truly hit 70% rate group another 10 days so, it'll monumental. (I'm US expat Germany. best shot visit home spring/summer get vaccinated EU fucked bad.)

Yeah basically EU reopening 2025 so. de facto ban. completely free export wish. something happening, mean can't happen. see happening

And never said would happen. course lie. could lied previously ambiguous ""adult caregiver"" category. honor system. Always been. Working butts educate country‚Äôs future say?

Let downvotes flow baby. Wow chick aggressive fuck, fuck think is? man? Luckily guy didn‚Äôt hit back, really tested waters could‚Äôve gotten friends deep shit. She‚Äôs fuckin bully sure. Supply increasing. sounds like hearsay. lady trash. looks mentally unstable too. pepper spray basically assault driver. Yes, vaccine absence symptoms probability infected low enough quarantining precaution make sense. cost-benefit analysis, absolute certainty. thousands people dying every day would suggest otherwise. don‚Äôt know long, definitely hard. keep thinking that, honestly. everywhere. vulnerable (healthcare workers, elderly, comorbidities), everyone eligible shot. two reasons Alaska far ahead states, terms roll out. Native Corporations on-fucking-point administration doses they've aloted. slick fast system getting done. second point getting Alaska's remote villages towns vaccinated high priority due danger spreading them. remoteness mean even single case gets village, entire village 200+ people become infected. they've prioritized heavily. people right make decision whether want risk catching Covid not.

But right go spread someone else.

I mean, sure, make decision go Rangers game, get sick, one paying it.

But if, five days game start feeling symptoms, go grocery store, I'm also shopping? Newsom said interview, green tier businesses fully reopen would created state gets 15-20 million vaccinations. California 11 million right now. Huh. Thanks wondered. Ohio seems going age. Wow. caused Europe behind vaccines? disagreement. First off, I'm saying someone go rave go hang unvaccinated grandparents. That's dumb, let's get way.

Isn't super-spreader event about? Forget unvaccinated grandparents - unvaccinated high-risk grocery store cashier? unvaccinated high-risk daycare worker? plenty unvaccinated high-risk folks around. someone go rave infect *am* saying people dealing year, they've lived numbers. People gotten this, seen others get it, they've determined there's life disease avoidance. Like said, make calculations differently.

That's fine good, right make calculations someone else? decided ""there's life disease avoidance"", go super-spreader event, come back asymptomatic COVID. go infect flight attendant airplane, lives high-risk person. made calculations high-risk person action.

What really true, scientifically (rather psychologically) nowhere near herd immunity still way many unvaccinated folks around. pandemic over. Nothing changed. SMH people can't wait another couple months fact reach herd immunity vaccination. 
As OK - again, pandemic. Anything contributes death count OK. Anything OK. acting like someone making arbitrary rules. pandemic. like it, complain virus. Friend SIL nurse manager. sent link appointments available public. SIL sent husband. nabbed appointments. rest gone minutes. reccomend checking hospital vaccine sites regularly case pop again. tweet yesterday, March 9 11:20 AM. Aka, full days worth data. That's great. Vaccines blessing. gonna feel liberated haha. Stay safe good luck making antibodies üòÇüòÇ Right, NFL stadia higher capacities, people spread-out. Looks like Chile another option well. Read original comment. de facto ban, de jure ban vaccine exports. proof eyes. Without EU would hardly producing vaccines themselves.

And UK would zero Biontech/Pfizer doses since production capacity themselves. see happening. Merkel said Germans prepare 3-4 tough months vaccines *start* make difference. 2 5 wanting three months ago. reduction 40 percent 25 percent seems pretty good me, especially trends indicating folks getting time. ""Pfizer week delivered 4.8 million doses Covid vaccine, developed alongside German partner BioNTech, EU.

This means EU taken delivery around 28 million doses two-shot jab, EU officials told Reuters news agency.

But bloc still 10 million doses short Pfizer said promised member states since rollout began late last year.""

I would link article gets auto-removed. knowledge European situation--my comment specific person replied said American.

In U.S., certain everyone wants shot able get one point next 1-2 months. Charles Michel Ursula VDL job. Herman Van Rompuy would never written Michel wrote without 200% certain true. 

And extremely negative press Juncker got, actually clever capable guy. would kept vaccines inside EU. Ursula seems timid irresolute. There's big stink PA suburban counties Philly getting short-changed one. one mentioned 69 years old Unlikely.

I always expected government petty post Brexit naively thought EU would grown it. Turns wrong they're bad us. needed put someone slightly, slightly better Atlas Feigl-Ding put there. reason. find weird recent variant talk. People pretend like new development. not. best bait news stories *right now*.

Not that, like said, variant identified somewhere, probably already while. fun fact, one ""reservation"" Alaska. vast majority tribes use corporation system, largely Alaska wasnt state Indian Appropriations Act passed, given choice self govern Alaska became state.

But u/blacktreefalls said, Native Corps done good job rolling doses. got 2nd shot today, I'm household resident Native Corp worker. saying I‚Äôm going this... what‚Äôs stop saying I‚Äôm smoker getting vaccine? I‚Äôve smoked cigarettes day... 3300 cases yesterday, per mayor 7 day avg dropping since beginning last month. It‚Äôs slow decline, still decline. hospitals aren‚Äôt even close capacity death rate plummeting. We‚Äôre giving daily highs vaccinations too. exactly big-ass order vaccine good problem have. You‚Äôve improved odds regardless.. I'll getting second pfizer shot two days school's spring break. know fully vaccinated, would safe take road trip I'll mostly myself?  fun Osterholm instead F? Thanks! thought could still spread virus asymptomatically pre-symptomatically? feel bad first reaction laugh, realized man died. like 10 people state? Germany, I'm still convinced I'll get shot 2022. would nice things actually got better within next months I'm optimistic shitty everything gone. course I'd like wrong I'll believe see it. According Pew 85% 65+ plan getting, already gotten, vaccine. 1 5 yet gotten plan to. We'll probably see slower growth people 65 becoming eligible newspaper ""radical left wing."" actually read history politco, know accused right-wing bias many times past high number conservative commentators write editorials. Overall, pretty centrist end day, probably lean slightly like media does. makes claim ""a radical left wing newspaper"" false every level. is, backstop. Sure, helps hedge supply issues vendors, 100 million doses JNJ ensures far reaching vaccine distribution logistically difficult areas. 

I like US here. lot sites would less likely announce could lead large group people congregating toward end-of-day, perverse goal isolating &amp; maintaining distance. That's true, eligible category? available appointments Miami-Dade Marlins Stadium tomorrow early 9:15 AM. Same. mows blind one really thought vet dude implement oversight considering little actually brought table. can‚Äôt remember kind investigation legal action taken him...am remembering correctly? think similar central NC. Walgreens shows available appointments Wake County zip codes plugged in, Wayne County hour east shows plenty appointments. still want quarantine symptoms exposure. vaccine halt transmission fully, reduce probably large percentage. I'm Serbia. signed get either Pfizer's vaccine Sputnik V. got choose more, highest efficacy ones so... I'm expecting get vaccinated next week so. far countries

It's actually dozens countries export vaccines to. 6 (maybe 7) countries think Europe alone. bunch countries Africa (I think 10), almost whole South America using Sputnik V several countries Asia. Mexico too. total 49 countries approved emergency use. Tied first place AstraZeneca (if AZ approved country last couple days). 

I think US EU yet understand big vacuum left Russia China fill. 

I say, find bit hypocritical media outlets, also government officials, try critisize Russia China engaging vaccine diplomacy. ""They trying present friends countries"" well, duhh. That's works. trying help countries countries accepting help, west helping, possibly bad thing? helping us. That's literally make friends lol.  I've idea. Could infrastructure profit margin. even zero, legislation prevents exported?

If truly wanted ban exports would stopped lipids leaving country. Without EU would hardly producing vaccines themselves. 80% estimates, clearly something wrong talking CDC literally saying approved vaccines ""inactivated"" 1 hr 45 mins 1 hr 46 websites (Walmart, Kroger CVS) say 60 make appointment. could kill someone driving work today. Life involves risk. Georgia mangling vaccination efforts. nightmare. People going AL SC get shots. thought would neat end youngest son qualified us Home Healthcare Workers got shots week. guys done week two could ship way BC. We‚Äôre still waiting months shit. ones lungs literally trashed, hardly shocking blood clots get thrown circulatory system. Blood clots get wedged many inconvenient places, veins responsible draining penis. Embalmers sometimes encounter arterial embalming decedent.

But something threw enough clots get wedged there, odds fair went brain, too, would explain death outcome. complains, tell stop whining. friend CA told Doctors saying may second dose may want hold off. Please enlighten us! Yup agree y'all. I'm pretty sure inmates got teachers wisconsin. starting really push em though that's good. yet areas rate deaths areas never locked down

But that's true. Even back first wave saw massive difference death rates country locked down, Finland, one isn't, know lockdowns slow spread low percentage, explains first point true.

It's lot low percentage. That's we've seen next flu outbreak year. lockdown strongly prevents spread. multi-faceted. need expand eligibility criteria. knee-jerk wrong way it. 

Beyond limited confusing eligibility criteria, biggest issue Kemp directing supply rural areas greater urban areas (at least relative demand). easy get appointment South Georgia, example, difficult Atlanta. 

As many things Kemp, hard tell incompetence political pandering (rural Georgia votes Kemp, Atlanta). made year, keep couple months then. COVID Pundit Tier List:

A Tier: Gottlieb, Jha

B Tier: Fauci

C Tier: Birx

D Tier: Osterholm

F Tier: Atlas, Feigl-Ding

obviously opinions understand everyone thread focusing day distribution administration numbers. know there's reporting lag distributing one day mean go arm day anyway. numbers likely catch next week higher dose numbers administered exercise common sense precautions make sure everything possibly infect someone flu.

Most us do. try good hygiene time. I'm saying limits COVID (a) much deadlier flu, (b) much likely spread asymptomatically. pretty settled science now. So, much likely accidentally infect someone COVID infect someone flu.

No arguments reasonable risk-mitigation strategy avoiding superspreader events altogether. ""social end"" pandemic? 10% population vaccinated, we're nowhere near herd immunity. happened mark ""social end""? fact spring everyone wants go party?

This disagreement. First off, I'm saying someone go rave go hang unvaccinated grandparents. That's dumb, let's get way.

What *am* saying people dealing year, they've lived numbers. People gotten this, seen others get it, they've determined there's life disease avoidance. Like said, make calculations expect kind reasoning toddler, grownup.

This unnecessarily patronizing. Sure, make comment biker rally, scenarios? get-togethers groups friends okay? large protests important causes?

If accept things okay others aren't, agree there's middle ground ""open everything up"" ""keep everyone homes threat criminal penalty."" accept middle ground exists, we're disagreeing draw line, means misguided make kind morality debate. came agreement Merck. Merck going manufacturing JnJ shot conjunction JnJ. clearly stated due blood clot clogging return. Covid causes blood clots. Might coincidence probably not. Oregon still 65+ phase, state believes they'll enough vaccine get nearly everyone wants end next month. 

At point, limiting factor getting enough qualified people jam doses arms. mass vaccination site Multnomah County 15k doses week, local pharmacies starting offer vaccines (my mom able get scheduled appointment nearby Walmart morning!), we're still going end place pretty soon plenty vaccine go around enough people distribute them. know 99%? Thanks dude, well! There's still plenty Pfizer vaccine order. helps bolster supply diversify sources case hiccups supply chain. Please report comments like rather engage.  Yea, numbers public they're zero. I‚Äôm going swing tonight ask. seems like minute clinic open 7:30 last walking vaccines 6:30 going try around 6:30 see. live 5 min away cvs. Seems like people easily satisfied then. distributing double we‚Äôve administering week straight now. 30M vaccine doses sitting shelves collecting dust. agree President take care first giving out. Preferably remaining vaccines given poorest countries world poorer ones. still lot pharmacies, dentist offices, eye doctors, random clinics, etc. still administer vaccine. God feel bad Europe. guys aren‚Äôt going normal summer looks like :( That's absolutely terrifying me.. feel it'll years know true toll Brazil case. hope they're able vaccinate public better test public. Brazil younger population less obese. People also spend time outside warmer. 

Despite factors favor, still high death rate. hospitals full, people also dying other, normally preventable, causes.

The current new cases still rising expect death rates go continue rise least 2 weeks. Even Wuhan style lockdown today... Yes, also immune system antibodies. cells etc. targeted use needed, particular border regions, doses also help ensure restore free movement goods people. key functioning health systems Single Market*

More vaccine doses border regions exchange open borders, that's interesting deal. might actually work.

I'm glad EU took opportunity buy additional doses became available. reason article headlines written actually great. weaker one dose Pfizer.   antibodies LOD line? American freedumbs mind sharing Rona, vaccines. Sounds like google go /r/conspiracy /r/conservative it‚Äôs posted several times obesity considered chronic at-risk condition? Pretty small sample size certainly worthy study. [I mean, article spells look thing probably care ‚Äî making sure end ICU dying ‚Äî efficacy three vaccines virtually identical,"" says Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair department epidemiology biostatistics University California, San perception vaccines may better others topline numbers efficacy studies. mRNA vaccines Pfizer Moderna found 95% effective preventing symptomatic COVID-19 second dose.

He also criticizes exactly doing, feel free email get feel super strongly it, I'll leave can't really compare numbers head head, says Pierre, ""these different trials different places different times,"" strains coronavirus running around likely somewhat different. 

No solidarity, even neighbors. Cool flex sub different place sure. Id imagine questions availability people asking anyone else side effect numbers gone faster. Pretty obvious Israel number fly 0 month like expecting.  Here's link full it. Long covid  I've much normal stuff entire time, i'm wondering people start laws related covid removed. saying wrong, know hat people immune reaction less great even spoofed virus vaccine.

Palmer, Alaska showing two month lead time. Bingo. I'm driving 150 miles tomorrow get mine. think they're worth effort energy.

They take things amount complaining going change that.

If want balanced reporting, issue FCC Fairness Doctrine.

I know remove end semblance required balance. is, part, news angle made specific audience.

CNN, fox, it. matter much, direction.

That said, says something that's true - nobody's opinion matter... matters. Whether hate them, objective truth that, truth.

My last point comment earlier CNN allowed sub.

If report guy said thing, say things, like is. case said things COVID, currently relevant area conversation (Texas + masks).

Anyways, waste energy CNN, they're worth it! Please keep healthy discussions going though - even run counter what's popular sub. Otherwise everything spiraling echo chamber that, ultimately, one good. Yep. second shot important immunity booster provides longer immunity resistance potential mutations.

From public health perspective, makes sense get first shot many people possible. practice, many people would neglect getting second shot would end equivalent stopping antibiotics feel better.

Basically can't first-shot strategy people stupid. Got first shot yesterday!

 National Guard gave mine really good needle, lol! gave us Moderna 94% effective strains mRNA vaccine works differently uses genetic code virus instead dead virus cells trigger immune response. supposed last longer that. made us wait 15 minutes could leave case side effects. one fell flopping. immediate side effects let know changes. 

Anyway, weighed risks thought get personal choice. hopeful put damn virus behind us done lot damage. sorry he‚Äôs (D)ifferent. don‚Äôt know iPhone ever use iOS Shortcuts shortcut finding information Vermont Covid cases vaccine distribution. think lot people didn‚Äôt expect available already too. clinical trial obviously going obnoxious people. Got mom early, sent friends sign link, put husband waiting lists ect. I‚Äôm much looking forward able see people spring, although course it‚Äôs long since got vaccine feel like need cautious get good data long continues highly effective. ok One biomed podcasts listen to, doctor said something effect ""like r0 Macro world, rate transmission inside one's body well"". every part body number antibodies actively attacking viral load coming invade body, vaccine immunizes one recognize virus, may ""vaccine side effects"" level response, fever, feeling tired, etc... accompanies later exposure virus. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm done masks. store wants kick wearing one point, guess won‚Äôt business anymore. wife's chromebook randomly updated windows 10 got 2nd shot glad Alaska's community wellbeing get way selfish personal adventures! close enough Alabama, drive there. ok state folks getting vaccine, lower vaccine rate Georgia  Well UK variant doubles proportion cases every 10 days (it 10% proportion February 26th, probably closer 20% now), predominant strain later month based existing case data. South African strain, agree data place, pretty good study New England Journal Medicine demonstrates 2-3 times poorer antibody response still sufficient maybe good.

I agree restrictions frustrating, get adequately vaccinated population reopening virus opportunity mutate problematic strains. seems like common problem lot states distributing way much rural areas. difference appointment availability pretty stark. FYI 7 day average back 800 today. 19 days ago. effectively saw massive drops, R=1 last 19 days. EU pretty late party public funding. US, UK plenty others funding developments whilst EU sketchy price. Received dose 1 Moderna today Kentucky. happy finally included daily count. Bro don‚Äôt believe manufacturers all. keep saying ‚Äúmore vaccine coming‚Äù months it‚Äôs still snails pace. I‚Äôm guessing gen pop august assumed first small far away places got bigger shipments doesn‚Äôt make sense send weekly shipments never said decreased already amount let rephrase - would knock 90%+ *potential* hospitalizations deaths. potential surge future really matter vulnerable vaccinated possibility another surge happening dwindles day millions getting shots. don‚Äôt check underlying health issues. mom 63 years old good condition, underlying health issue puts extreme risk. looks healthy, 5‚Äô3‚Äù 110 pounds looks like 45 worst days. checked appointment pharmacist asked qualified. mom note ready doctor, mom said underlying issue pharmacist said ok. Didn‚Äôt bother look note anything. oxygen really makes think covid related. worry, heard Moderna gives superpowers since rearranges DNA.  paper indicate ""trend"" - wealthier women babies past.

However, missing article raw data.

Women rich families still less kids.

""Women lower income brackets tend higher birth rates across board.""

Women families make $10,000 less 66 children per 1000 women per year.

Women families make $200,000 43 children per 1000 women per watching around 39:30 mark. choice. be. press conference today, dont think transcript yet. That‚Äôs change tho Well, constitutionally protected right peaceably assemble petition government redress. actually constitutional right ""have fun"".

That said, care less biker rally. feel anyone might die though. point you‚Äôre idiot hurts. us, ""virtue signaling"", think incorrect assessment anyway.

I think people say continue wear masks actually continue wear masks two reasons.

First, people lost lot trust FDA CDC. FDA trust problems years, CDC sacrosanct Trump got hold doctors charge lied people either keep jobs political agenda.

I'm saying CDC never lied, withheld skewed truth before, time exceptional breadth harm caused.

The second reason people scared. us underlying conditions mean careful. fully convinced pandemic actually variants refuel spite current vaccine, can't afford take chances to.

I wearing mask quite while. Yes, inconvenient like it, I'll it. case doubt me, currently left house full year except go doctor walk area one else goes. come contact another person, wear P100 chemical mask, far uncomfortable surgical mask N95 mask plus get number people looking like crazy.

I'm crazy, can't afford health problems. really tho? comment says better ever could... 


One day, United Kingdom hungry went butcher's.

There, said ""Hello, would like 100 million latest sausages please"".

""Sure"", said butcher, ""but latest sausages, nobody 100 million yet. get 100 million, need pay well invest creating new farm rear pigs, new factory turn sausages.""

But butcher warned, ""It take six months receive first sausages, could hiccups along way.""

He continued, ""However, return investment I'll guarantee get first 100 million sausages produced"".

""Sounds great!"" Said UK, signed contract paid immediately. understood may delays, got deal early plenty time sausages would approved human consumption around 8 months.

A days later, Inclusive Sausage Alliance ('ISA'), consisting Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, arrived butcher's. left offer terms UK, 400 million sausages, shared among whole European Union. sign right away.

After short passed, angry EU Commissioner appeared. ""How dare negotiate sausages EU's behalf? right!"", screamed top lungs. ""From on, order sausages around here!"".

Some time passed. Lots time, actually. Three whole months. That's ridiculous amount time.

""Hello butcher, represent EU Commission. Give 400 million sausages three months. want mine time UK!"", demanded.

""W... w... well"". butcher struggled words. Flabbergasted unreasonable demand placed him. ""Well, know latest sausages take si...""

""Three months!"" barks stroppy EU Commissioner.

""O...ok I'll best get three months, realistically take six. I'm guaranteeing anything. ordered three months ago would probably got deadline.""

The EU signed exact deal ISA offered three months ago, included agreement fund upgrades existing farm factory Belgium.

Another three months pass. We're present day. Thirty percent UK eaten delicious sausage, millions EU citizens starving.

""They promised us millions sausages now!"" scream politicians, putting show home audience, feigning surprise six month project really delivered three. German French elections far away, dare risk seen cause failure. can't admit caused three month delay. can't bare embarassment Britain one fed happy nations world, Brexit. Britain can't allowed succeed. must made example every opportunity.

""Britain stole four million sausages!"", cry!

""The British sausages ordered 8% meat anyway cause terrible diarrhoea!"", claims unnamed German official.

""Take sausages Britain's deliveries!"" insists EU Commission!

""Ban exports bockwurst!"" demands Germany!

To continued... Got first dose Moderna yesterday! partner eligible essential worker made final appointment day Walgreens. went hopes they'd extra. said 5-10 appointments show every day they're often looking people poke. Might worth calling pharmacies offering vaccines 5pm see come take extra hands. got Moderna, even feel it. problems all. get that. NPR CNN whoever say advantage one shot, they're wrong.

They definitely referring that. trying go get people get vaccinated that's obviously important, feel like they're presenting JnJ's vaccine misleading way, EFFICACIOUS vaccines. Now, know they're that. talked existing differences shortcomings, would result fewer people getting vaccinated. still like bs. get motives, like people stick facts ans frank. Unfortunately, many people *would* decide take JnJ's vaccine one ones. fine, whatever, get it. Two weeks Seems proven wrong. record time too!

[Daily COVID-19 case totals ticking Oh shit... Maybe state WI then. number tests coming lab absolutely tanked following Thanksgiving never recovered. lie people** want listen. headline misleading.

The headline may poorly written, 100% factually correct. **FULL** effect occur till \~15 days second dose. headline thing average joe-schmo reads/understands...then think good thing. Companies used EU member states public funding develop kickstart vaccine production EU.
 
Same companies shipping elsewhere without meeting obbligation EU.

The major failure ban exports others others so. Correct I'm wrong show vaccines helping suppress symptoms eliminate spread? 

That seems article saying: Dr. Pedro Piedra, Baylor College Medicine, said vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection, work hard stopping people getting seriously ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt preclude getting infected, risks considerably lower,‚Äù Piedra Piedra said that‚Äôs Pfizer‚Äôs 95% efficacy rate measured.  Instead publicizing cancelling clinic, publicize everyone arriving required sign statement meet current, listed, requirements getting shot. later determined false, get trouble. Would probably keep ineligible people away. ""you missed point""

""lol i'm telling""  


Yeah one... ‚ÄúMask mandates associated decreases daily COVID-19 case death growth rates 1‚Äì20, 21‚Äì40, 41‚Äì60, 61‚Äì80, 81‚Äì100 days implementation.‚Äù report Metro Times shit rag. headline helping push ""well 100%"" crowd even towards getting vaccine. Get shot ignore publication. Yah bet actual cases covid even UK variant grossly undercounted. Deaths closer right also undercounted. honestly never know. likely mild infection covid, bad enough shape leading tip scales lead collapse. family actively try get one sooner? pain means working. Grin bear Yes. 100% correct. guess I'm reacting Canadians Europeans calling US ""selfish"" past week. mine notified. Im senior fear dying. well unfortunately numbers yet. Although thought correct know near amount adults vaccinated drop masks totally. 200 million adults easier say people say they've shot haven't. hate damn mask case number drops bit large portion population done wear stores work.  Yeah, except he'd replaced lieutenant governor, he's least bad. I've never heard anything two weeks. UK paid setup production line UK condition first 100M doses production line went UK. people want call blocking exports primarily way justify EU acting.

&amp;#x200B;

The reality someone produce vaccines using different production line UK could export first dose, doses factories question exported would legal method UK prevent doses leaving country. UK could sue breach contract afterwards though, imagine penalties would stiff. 100M vaccines produced there's change export regulations, vaccines made factories go anywhere else world without breaching contract.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest differences EU UK UK front plans spring last year companies involved planned around that, made sure solid legal protections ensure supply, EU advertised going export vaccines start changed month ago. mean, claim call bad vaccine. also explicitly call good vaccine initial post either.

This quote also carries pretty heavy implication probably ""done"".

Like think air quotes said loud. ""Yeah, 'done'""

""Sure, one (airquotes) ""done""""

Puts pretty negative light it? can't wait numbers go Texas left dumbfounded like scared little idiots are. like California Florida similar numbers.

Also, getting everyone 55 vaccinated take much longer... probably end April.

But, right. also need find way get others vaccinated meet certain criteria. link this? I‚Äôd like share reach herd immunity, yes (unless convince 100% adults get vaccinated).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think US approval AZN ""when"", much still ""if"" People hear news others getting vaccinated immediately get relaxed over-confident. Pfizer way behind like vaccine manufacturers. reason 7: Money People live nursing homes ones ending hospital. every single person 50 opportunity decline vaccine yet lol.

fuck politicians Right, nothing known known. think smart J&amp;J trial 1-dose first instead way around. lets get vaccine approved faster, time people would need booster 2-dose data likely possibly even approved. I'm slated get J&amp;J Saturday fully expecting get 2nd shot summer lol I'm glad even include DC, piss poor job Better 2 million experts predicting first started. will. patient. COVID. Is. A. Vascular. Disease.

It's terrifying watching many people willing run head first first airborne blood disease society faced. Someone said thing thread. actual source no? Curious myself. Word, 92 grandma wants reopen senior center see friends instead locked apartment. (My state already vaccinated elderly).

From virus itself, handling patients nursing homes, side effects isolations, senior citizens definitely got short end stick pandemic. Could be. Another possibility J&amp;J doses hand case 2-dose regimen trial underway yields positive results. might make second dose available people already gotten first dose. effectiveness bumped 70 80+% (like Astrazeneca 12-week delay 2-dose regimen shown UK), second dose J&amp;J probably warranted. Although 1-dose J&amp;J basically 100% effective hospitalization death trials (like Pfizer/Moderna), could halve remaining likelihood becoming ill ill J&amp;J would nice. Covid-19 still highly infectious would nice lay bed 1-2 weeks people get sick it, possibly pass others. fact experience flu symptoms pretty reliably, even vaccinated.

Those times *know* it, though. nothing. can't say sure whether ever asymptomatically infected someone. *No one* can. You‚Äîor I‚Äîcould well killed someone unknowingly spreading disease now, that's *not fault*. leads next people disease vectors, disease vectors contagious disease about.

...which *always* contagious diseases spreading. That's part human.

It's risk management. Every day, make choices could kill us around us. fact, people referenced original post likely *way* danger motorcycles COVID. life life life, though, we're making calculations differently.

This people talking mentioned ""social end"" pandemic. We're there. Everyone point decide there's living life avoiding death. some, last March. others, they'd content live way indefinitely. Neither ""right"" ""wrong."" said, one thing DeSantis right lock nursing homes. rest strategy based lies withholding information... taking care political donors expense public health.

Did luck vaccines rolled right opened nursing homes?

Possibly, luck strategy, death toll much higher would competent leadership.

How much better impossible tell part consistently dishonest reporting sought punish everyone data scientists school districts dared report actual unmolested data.

Defend bullshit want. Thousands deaths FL directly attributable disinformation lack leadership. We'll see many month two (if) finally get counted. That‚Äôs sad. humans US countries shouldn‚Äôt ignore Russian vaccine. situation trying get pandemic, give shot. Yeah got running sooner EU countries like Britain ordered early. think saddest yet amusing line whole livestream ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know Asian! thought Indian.‚Äù says loves Asians, always calls people called him.

Like actually thought justifying something there. asthma trying find information high-risk adults. live Nebraska used high-risk adults regardless age group 1C. group 1C people congregate living residences. checked CDC's website half hour ago said thing, 1C people congregate living residences. Nowhere either rollout schedule mention anything adults high risk medical conditions. tried searching news articles change rollout schedule find anything. go back CDC website checked half hour ago back original schedule, high risk adults 1C. website longer mentions anything people congregate living understand better, global indicator

A week better indicator month? Yes sure! vaccinations death third beginning January. Infections nursing homes 15% level end December 2020. risk groups vaccinated might precautions keep infections lower, see much normal daily life. Slowly, we‚Äôre getting better place. well could be, case 20x/day quantity makes lot sense. hope wore masks windows open drive. best single shot

Could be. Hopefully follow-up analysis like AZ. said, I'm like 99.999% certain recommend booster new data drops, reason increasing duration immunity.

Definitely agree. Sure, argue semantics want.

Meanwhile, many doses exported UK? many EU?

If UK vaccine exports, British press government would point statements. Like would say, look, exported 10 million doses Chile wherever. fact done seems imply strongly exports made.

All they're saying ""we ban exports, that's outrageous"". proof pudding, say.

The UK has, via prohibiting contracts political pressure, enacted de facto ban vaccine exports. Everything else semantics. Right. We‚Äôre essentially agreeing. Yes, give us fear-mongering, AZ-hating German media. that's quality. thought moderna 10 shots per vial  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worthwhile redistribute surplus due logistics issues said. think would good idea shift future allocations based demand. Regional shortages state issue big disparities per capita dose allocation federal issue.  manage vaccinate enough people we'll right back lockdown November 2021. Joe Rogan exactly this. friends got covid lost power grid froze. still changed tune convinced virus made lab. Womp womp. nice Thing is, agree one-shot bit gimmick, efficacy. one-shot effective enough given enough time measure sure, could best single shot. said, I'm like 99.999% certain recommend booster new data drops, reason increasing duration immunity. Reddit American technology company based California. you‚Äôre American-centric website, it‚Äôs usually implied geographic location discussed United States unless stated otherwise. understand that

and understand better, global indicator

if pessimist, surely try avoid wanting find appreciate positive trends,

but thats Problem loose edge fast? one year? saying arent right scientific sources opinion would love fact. Thanks. I've Georgia quite occasions. definitely shortage obese people, that's sure. EMS hospital rounds months back. infection graph took sharp turn flattened 7-10 day mark. 
 
This source Read article. even stop moment read beyond headline? Meanwhile New York next month expand Dunkin‚Äô Donuts TD Bank employees E shoe sizes. don‚Äôt think so. 60+ group 900k next group (50+ type 2) around 1.5 million, almost 2.5 million becoming eligible within 2 weeks. Dewine also said going schedule 3 weeks start week next week, would imagine next big group won‚Äôt end March.  safety officer separate us LMAO. 

[NO y'all guess, think we'll see states dropping restrictions? think we'll seeing adults elligble get vaccine end month. city keeps dropping age limit requirements get since seem ton vaccines. agree another surge occur think nothing done wrong. hospitals fill again, choice whether theres public support not. say let morbidly obese die would save billions year Wow, 32 million doses sitting shelves? third administered? Time open need withhold second doses anymore. supply there. spreading less vulnerable population, since can't get toehold vulnerable due vaccines, effectively inoculating population can't access vaccines moment, thus closing gap herd immunity even faster.

Not ideal situation, more-infectious samesy risk variant might actually helpful we're endgame. Yeah. ready post snarky comments till actually looked town. 49 min drive downtown Ft. Worth. WAY large portion folks living commuting. mention according article school district 1,400 students...which clearly means draw wider area. 900k per *day*? seeing 900k per week? like watching bigrig jackknife 10 cars ahead you. 


It's probably gonna hit directly, damn gonna fuck day. could also explain J&amp;J 85% effective severe disease 28 days, increased 100% 49 days

Okay, solid argument. Hopefully follow-up participants then. AZ did. word differently. Giving second dose prematurely stalls/limits increase efficacy. literally reduce efficacy mechanistic sense, prevents reaching would higher efficacy first dose allowed reach peak. end result essentially ""lowering"". 

Nope üòÇüòÇ. understood meant. explanation haha. give word, that's immune system works. almost definitely result wide CI. Yeah lot steps pipeline:

\- Moderna tells CDC doses ready

\- CDC tell states doses ready

\- States order doses

\- Doses delivered states

\- States administer doses

There's non-trivial lag every step. hope countries taking notes creating bottlenecks planning smooth rollout.

Like Canadian vaccine starts pouring in, scheduling website crashes load they're like ""there way could foreseen much demand"" takes couple weeks fix would pissed. Guess stores common? Masks I‚Äôm sure exactly want ‚Äúadfontesmedia‚Äù article. really disprove saying. Politico leans left clearly. radical left wing newspaper acceptable Reddit. signed dad February 21 said he's 192,275th. 

But probably highly location-based depending sites sign get people in. think infrastructure capacity ramp 4-5 million shots per day? I've assuming supply going outpace ability deliver shots. form return normality 7-15 months? Netherlands start easing lockdown next month gradually open towards summer, along European countries. pure fear mongering propaganda. First offer vaccines. First offer universal basic income Alaska residents! really need open eligibility. never seen easy make appointment past days. Either need advertise better move on. town 49 minutes drive (had look up) Dallas/Ft.Worth area 7.5 million people. way town close area large portion commuters.  50% population got flu shots last year that's entire flu season. US done massive vaccination feat like recent times trust government, distribution medical sites fuck create bottleneck. next day two, we'll hit 25% adults least first shot. May 1, think 50%. got email today employer (local government) employees want vaccine considered group 1b. Woohoo! sent us link employee waitlist. hope get called soon! Compared 2.3 million sub that‚Äôs low Fungal spores wind pollinated trees. IMO, think next days weeks we‚Äôll see stages go Alaska route open everyone. It‚Äôll enticing realize opening everyone might mean opening quicker anticipated. furthermore, days pass, supply get makes likely they‚Äôll open everyone.  county rules supercede state rules Illinois. example, live DuPage County. qualify based state rules, county chosen expand.

The premise certain areas state excess vaccine, need expand. However populated areas issue yet.

It's little frustrating. Perhaps word differently. Giving second dose prematurely stalls/limits increase efficacy. literally reduce efficacy mechanistic sense, prevents reaching would higher efficacy first dose allowed reach peak. end result essentially ""lowering"". 


On note J&amp;J, behavioral. measured efficacy 28 days, know previous phases antibody levels J&amp;J peak 50 days. could also explain J&amp;J 85% effective severe disease 28 days, increased 100% 49 days. It'd nice allocation dynamic, though. ""Oh county blew allocation? extra. Oh county sitting many doses open eligibility? We're going pull back bit allocation."" Doses administered, March 7:

United States 90.4 million 

United Kingdom 23.3 million assumption 240,000 vaccinations per day. Later article mention expectation April 400,000 day, 500,000 day May, 600,000 day June. 

Why even give prediction rests assumption already know correct? I'm convinced health officials literally dumb rocks. I‚Äôve first shot, arm sore day nothing else. husband both, fatigued 24 hours both. could much earlier. merkel von der leyen stole us summer We‚Äôve patient far, remember we‚Äôre soooo damn close. it‚Äôs open everyone recommend apply every county, state, city location possible. Get many irons fire can. numbers game point every individual vaccinated protects us. covid 19 punching air rn Literally right posted comment see this. Thanks peace mind sorry you‚Äôre feeling exactly I‚Äôm feeling right said spray tan actually toxic? odds spray tan ingredient would toxic vs vaccine? Occam's razor ... Let start saying really appreciate discussion despite fact disagree quite things. types comments articles buried media. met derision false accusations, especially coronavirus sub.

I agree media terrible reporting personally try rely media decide anything. There's old saying reading news paper thing expert see idea. cut media think simply look excess death rate past 52 weeks see something's clearly killing lot people normal excess death count actually higher covid death count. clearly something wrong people dying greater numbers. 

So even someone covid car accident called ""covid death"" know fact past 12 months ton people died. covid it? lockdowns really kill 500,000 people covid zero? I'm sure lockdowns fact kill people killed enough affect excess death count way would instantly noticeable way media could hide. Covid non issue it'd show numbers way media lie about. ""Something"" killing lot people started exactly covid started. covid it? Secondary know anecdotal we're trusting media trust assuredly trust that's friends nurses several NYC hospitals. went hell march. nothing else, personally, undeniable confidence many many many people died NYC due covid died. friends saw dozens hundreds view eyes. I've known 20 years know they're lying. may mean anything (after all, I'm guy internet, could lying), means something personally. Unless covid deaths 100% funneled friends rest city/nation really deal it, make leap say friends saw hospitals wide spread across city, reported across wife went doctor discover needed surgery, prevented going back covid measures. Later year, one visit son hospital surgery covid measures.

I get hard. Almost full year ago father serious accident, know would make it. lockdowns started, getting anyone talk us hospital hard. conscious two weeks basically hell go through. able see THREE MONTHS due lengthy hospital stay followed rehab center - closed visits. Also due covid several surgeries ignored, arm leg never preventable hospital staff completely inundated dealing covid. suffered stroke result accident since. Absolutely shitty year.

What see affects vaccine? already think lockdowns went far. friends nurses never caught covid, literally wore fucking garbage bags work due lack PPE reused ""one time use"" masks WEEKS. enough protect them. shitty mom visit father even though owned serious masks respirators eye protection nurses literally finding things floor use PPE managing get sick (also quite nurses get sick, friends get lucky overall). 

But vaccine spread far wide encouraged possible. get this. family immigrants - believe sorts crap many want vaccine due irrational fears (like covid came space? Even true wtf dow vaccine, Aunt take since covid came space). people inject random stuff given literal witchdoctor (I wish held rigorous evaluation previous vaccines? No.

I mean serious point that: mechanism could vaccine harm? mean really heard anything low quantity vaccine delayed effect. 

If kill fast, hurt fast, would effect 3 months later? vaccine works making body create antibodies, vaccine system quickly. I'm sure exact time days maybe 1-2 weeks body expels everything. What's left antibodies ""vaccine"". could vaccine harm 3 months now? We've also given vaccines hundreds thousands people we're seeing issues 3 months line. I'm depending news solely, I've sought information vaccine see possible harm can't find anything. things find potential immediate-effects, maybe interactions certain types conditions (autoimmune disorders example), healthy person zero mechanism delayed harm, immediate harm we'd know already due millions doses given. 

I think good skeptical things, got first dose already sure hell looked information agree seems rushed. research locate anything said could harmful EXCEPT immediate onset issues within days taking vaccine. Given fact millions others already got vaccine me, felt okay knowing real risk anaphylaxis - deadly peanut allergy carry epipen anyways. 

I would've hesitated take December, maybe even January, confidence we'd know safe.  understand it, data available August, back Russian data called insufficient Western media. data publicized Western media attention already moved different topics. numbers sounded good true Pfizer others came similar numbers. Add amount politicization Sputnik V Russia, well-known shenanigans propaganda pieces Russian government, add bit Russophobia, cocktail. I‚Äôm going Orlando next week, can‚Äôt wait! Abbott absolute shitstain governor. literally diminishing harms actions aren‚Äôt seen harsh light. That‚Äôs defending them. third option. even vulnerable people vaccinated yet. Shareholders would panic sell board would get shit canned Yellow fever thing. Can't enter many LA African countries without showing port debarkation. Lol what? Easter, Memorial Day, 4th July, etc?

I've seen plenty guys highway overpasses helping vaccine injections. set records annual flu shots administered months ago. peoples grandparents people health conditions aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet? Um... guy, ""16 over"" eligibility requirement? depends are. Appointments hard come lot places. areas bottleneck seems availability providers, vaccine doses. We've amount people stands NFL games almost half year, far outbreaks.  Look CDC studies coming out. It‚Äôs virus. CDC self interest say restrictions work even estimates interventions single digit percentages overall trend. 500,000 extra deaths year big deal? spent half day running hospital another town get records didn‚Äôt ask either. Really, providers want immunize everyone. long elderly folks denied, think shots arms main goal. Curious smoking. need medical records take word it? Maybe states different, eligible ‚Äúessential workers‚Äù state include obvious healthcare workers, teachers, law enforcement also anyone works manufacturing company (even office worker), engineers (also office workers), professionals. point seems silly keep creating new essential categories would easier age. expression 'a moot point'. think lot people felt frustrated really stalled start, missing original promises.

Not that, saw healthy 16 year old part time workers news getting vaccinated 62 64 year old parents. recognize perfect boy hard early feel remotely like prioritizing well based actual risk.

Now feel like pretty much essential workers older folks able get it, really puts ease. I'm high risk, wait turn. think may need loosen requirements areas within week. CA Newsom recently allocated 40% vaccines select low income zip codes, tons essential workers, senior citizens. It‚Äôs probably slowing us down. Oxford vax losing efficacy given booster prematurely make sense, given effect vector resistance. Sputnik V uses 2 different adenoviruses, circumvent this. also hopefully mean 2 dose trial J&amp;J shows good increase. it'll booster, they're giving first shot 8 weeks instead 4.

Okay, said makes sense üòÇ. swear god I'm trying sound condenscending üòÇüòÇ even though probably sounds way. Efficacy dropping second dose make immunological sense. take word haha. antibodies vector help neutralize vector second dose. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies impacted all. cannot be. anti-vector immunity make anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity improve. cannot hinder it. mechanistically possible. get additional Spike proteins circulation. Worst case scenario - get second dose all. scenario, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity engaged way. 

Sputnik V uses different vector prevent vaccine neutralized, allow vector infect cells allow cells produce Spike protein. spike protein stimulates anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity intensifies proliferation SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells ramps germinal center reactions, allowing prolonged immune memory also higher affinity antibodies (more potent antibodies, increased number/titre).

Hopefully explained well.

Edit: Again, JnJ measure prematurely. Efficacy increase time, mostly due placebo group people way likely get infected time. lot faster like South Africa Manaus? There's lag newly available supply administration capacity opening up. Generally providers open appointments doses know have. Somehow knew stickler rules.

Before pandemic saw world (or least US) existing left/right dichotomy. was, still am, firmly left.

What's really surprised emergence (or least revealing) authoritarian/libertarian divide.

It's certainly eye-opening see BLM supporters, example, go hard state police intervention society comes COVID. 

Fear flushes chumps, suppose.

Anyway, safe healthy day! \- There's 50,000 appointments NYC available right now. issue distributors. Open up... mean I‚Äôm trying dick

No worries, I'm honestly random guy internet expertise subject field. viewpoint simply, we're close end outlast little vigilance. small amount patience save lives - important full crowds point. that's coming someone breathes live sporting events can't wait get back 20,000+ best friends. least me, idea would get vaccine. pleasant surprise said circle name want one we'll can. Maybe week, big centers get running probably won‚Äôt hard. actually opened TX. Maybe unofficial though statewide guess, opened Houston least Vaccinated unvaccinated? Administration shot goes arm. Distribution medical provider gets doses mail. Posted another comment, look states medical reserve corps. That's states know using Haha, click one helped get Mom vaccine.

I definitely owe beer (at least) that. Folks impression vaccines don‚Äôt even work variants, isn‚Äôt true

Oh FUD. Good grief. many people know buying FaceBook rumor bullshit. ""It modifies DNA!"" No. ""It'll give light case COVID!"" No. list goes on. Ok, let's look Astrazeneca, company. manufacturing plants UK EU. needs fulfill contract Canada. chooses deliver EU. 

Why? UK has, via prohibiting contracts political pressure, enacted de facto ban vaccine exports. Everything else semantics. Ok. ü§∑ Check state medical reserve corps. seems common entity governments using. least state, work aside poking needle arm require medical background 1.6 thousand? many days row distribution twice high administration?

It's somewhat misleading look distribution numbers Tuesdays Wednesdays. half distributions week reported Tuesdays Wednesdays, almost remainder reported three days, Thursdays Saturdays.

So, two days row reported distribution number double administrated number. Last week also two days row Tuesday Wednesday.

That said, reported distribution figures (averaged prior 7 days) around three million day two weeks, 7-day average administered doses 70% total past week, there's probably significant room improvement demand exceeds supply. Unless person administering vaccine injects sinovial tissue joint causing Apparently it‚Äôs pretty unpleasant. think they're Kalamazoo I'm saying sub seems think way expand access lowering age unless that's done, nothing expanded. Honestly think speaks general demographic users here. source somewhere? 

I got first dose Pfizer shot days ago. friend wants help moving apartment weekend. day 8 first dose point.

I still intend wear mask try social distance, I'm worried I'll still chance catching virus. makes hesitant helping friend. 

Do sources there's immunity week? know i've met like man. ever NC get beer. depends state. work emergency department beginning, people know healthcare it, family mom first... 95 year old great-grandmother, 70+ grandparents, dad get Ohio opened 50 over. feels like good representation it‚Äôs slowly getting opened wide availability understand Nashville seems like everyone getting vaccinated. question is: US taken blind eye Sputnik V? It‚Äôs super impressive hindsight much data prove 3 vaccines. It‚Äôs approved Russia since August think that. someone measles scare march 2019 child vaccinated pissed. Initial diagnosis Measles parents fuming. Thankfully infectious department came house testing it. awful thing go through. antibodies. sat meeting work today mask propped head hand realized done year thought good felt something small. get taste like live naturally again, we'll ease back normalcy without really thinking it. Sorry hear peepoo Large amounts flu shots administered every year traveling vaccination companies workplaces.

Guess people right now?

Also CDC federal pharmacy partnership evaluation period gets deployed nationwide. Despite rhetoric wartime effort etc. run urgency DMV. oh I'm sure, know case Maryland moved Vaccinations seem moving forwards states full speed still. I'm glad US vaccination effort going far better initial pandemic response. linked hearsay article local TV station reporting reports someone else. Yet unable produce original reports universities. original reports exist reputable? knows? clear can't produce would have.

A search terms English showed Lanclet articles scandal president took vaccine first absolutely mention 11% efficacy. question becomes: would president take worse vaccine scandal, could've picked vaccine scandal?

Your health ministry contradicts this: note impossible efficacy judged right now, blinds lifted yet know actually vaccine doesn't.

Meanwhile Lanclet published globally reviewed paper showed previous post showed 99% neutralizing antibody seroconversion vaccine (generally correlated immunity) well multiple sources reporting 80-90% phase 3 efficacy rates multiple countries.

So believe hearsay small, newly founded privately owned TV station without original article corroboration, results multiple countries major independent medical publisher? Hong Kong 97 American big pharma dictating gets it, even developed Germany  think distribution time work kinks administration.

Comparing two weeks ago booking appointment relative today, exact pharmacies went like 6 slots per day, dozens, like 12 hours every 3 minutes. 

I think disparity go places come up, places iron kinks. hate break you, Johnson Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer still protect new variants. Every single one 100% effective preventing death hospitalizations. overall effectiveness lower matter symptoms reduced nothing mild sniffles. Right, point isnt simple looking stats deciding change things up. vaccines first became available states recently, one vaccines required specialized transport storage, making logistics difficult making virtually impossible re-distribute present surplus one area another area greater need. production availability increased, options.

Alaska probably one challenging states due remote people are, usage statistics first availability probably useful stat. Likewise, regional shortages state issue federal one.

I love stats, work living. dont think state state arguments based handful stats particularly useful consider much consider nationwide distribution logistics. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

something keep mind vaccines minors currently studied. need higher threshold herd immunity (say 80% 10 population), making coronavirus vaccine required attending schools help lot. also immunity following natural infection, get eventually. No. ones don‚Äôt get vaccine likely get COVID antibodies way, either way we‚Äôll get herd immunity.

We vaccinate everyone wants it, leaves enough people disease circulate indefinitely, much lower level current levels. unvaccinated continue get sick die, overload hospitals anymore, tragedy anymore, made choice.

Guess what? worked restaurant summer outside 90+ degree weather mask. mask sucked removed alone chance. complained, still fucking wore it, worse things world wearing mask.

You best believe i'm burning mask come summer, know wearing good thing helps people. Y'all need chill mean sounds pretty cool too, I‚Äôd love pizza oven.

Wood pellet grill must though. and/or green egg top cooking tools could IMO quick googling, article August money paid advance paid $1.2 billion, EU paid ‚Ç¨336 million top previous ‚Ç¨750 million Germany, Italy, France Netherlands. amounts seem similar timeframes well.

Mostly motion putting arm straight caused amount discomfort, sitting desk example issue me. play safe got shot left arm I‚Äôm right handed. 

I get second shot one weeks time I‚Äôm excited! 1.25m people per day currently getting first dose (or dose J&amp;J), 29 people per second 12 hour day moment.

61.1m vaccinated now, 255m total adults US. would mean need 193.9m people get vaccinated, next 3 months (92 days June 10) 12 hours per day would mean 49 per second, 76.

It's hard see going supply. So, mom currently one dose. received two weeks ago. potentially going back school next week wondering, contract covid spread her, would disease still severe even though one shot? She‚Äôs high risk.

Wikipedia, people understand major area Fort Worth is...

The population Fort Worth 909,585. Population Austin 978,908.

""If worn masks could back normal now"" argument load trash. absolutely infuriates people keep saying it.

If wore masks, mean COVID would disappeared we'd back normal. Know everyone wore masks? Germany, UK, Spain, Italy, France. spike cases like America.

When decided move goalposts ""keep hospitals overwhelmed"" ""reduce COVID cases there's never chance hospitals overwhelmed even R-value spontaneously quarduples"" guaranteed end vaccination rollout. wait July able vaccinated OR. Great.... EU order also enough use capacity production tried volunteer several times never opportunities, even hours away. Good volunteers! Bad really wanted volunteer haha risk death car crash many times higher airplane too. point they‚Äôre low enough difference basically negligible, *especially* since people preconditions many cases already negligible. 

We sit argue day want, guess wait see us right. 

I‚Äôm highly confident restrictions removed get vaccine sometime mid late April, early may LATEST, never segment people age 50 groups. anyone link one right size, I'd appreciate one beginning see stories like April may continue wear masks It‚Äôs cooked. fit casings smoke (I‚Äôve got Traeger wood pellet grill) ideal way go.

Yes article directly states mask mandate ends Wednesday. state stands right now. keep denying it, UK &amp; US (one way another) blocking exports countries EU supplying lot countries, close neighbors US. 
Whether blocking exports justified people vaccinated blocking countries getting vaccines another topic.

Every country responsibility towards inhabitants first place think defend providing vaccines countries lower priority compared vaccinating own.

What thought quite unbelievable EU got lot flak resolution enabled block exports actually enforced export ban. Especially consider lot less doses deliverd compared promised citing production problems exporting doses outside EU time (looking AZ). numbers refer overall efficacy, referring prevention severe cases. stated before, there's way yet compare heart/lung damage specifically. shown prevent hospitalization death near 100 percent. J&amp;J production issues. ""who"" receive, ""when"" manufacture many doses. takes 3 months, reality (probably) needed anymore USA. Barring disaster, may/june every adult willing vaccinated already served.

Pfizer yet fulfill initial order 100 million, correct? bought Pfizer, we'd wait original 100 million delivered we'd get extras? announced deal produce Pfizer vaccines really get delivered June help US first round vaccinations.

Don't expect J&amp;J pull vaccines ass. mean? fully support EU setting manufacturing vaccines. 

I‚Äôm shocked haven‚Äôt done so. haven‚Äôt gone j&amp;j said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll manufacture 100 million extra doses within eu we‚Äôll use?‚Äù

We NEED manufacturing vaccines. Yeah, rightfully got flamed neighborhoods around. feel cheering virus? Sorry, finally beating none doom gloom going change that. Love love love this!

For Sinopharm, China‚Äôs biggest vaccine developer, coronavirus offers shot future reach. state-backed company betting urgent need inoculate billions people across world finally allow establish credentials global supplier. 

Its first Covid-19 vaccine approved Chinese authorities late last year, handing company lion‚Äôs share national immunisation programme started earnest January. second approved last month. 

Whether Sinopharm use springboard roll vaccine beyond vast domestic market, however, depends combustible mix politics, trust supply. Thomas Bollyky, senior fellow global health, economics, development Council Foreign Relations Washington, said still-limited supply vaccines based pioneering mRNA technology ‚Äî used BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna jabs ‚Äî running favour. 

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll see many regions world secured early doses proven players turning vaccines like Sinopharm vaccine,‚Äù said. 

A sprawling company revenues Rmb500bn ($77.7bn) last year, Sinopharm‚Äôs operations span development, sale distribution major medicines, including traditional Chinese treatments. subsidiary, China National Biotec Group, developed vaccines. country‚Äôs biggest jab maker, CNBG still accounts fraction Sinopharm's revenues. 

&amp;#x200B;

# handful nations 

So far handful nations including UAE, Bahrain, Pakistan, Egypt, Serbia Hungary authorised Sinopharm‚Äôs first vaccine, company said efficacy rate 79 per cent phase 3 trials. 

The vaccines made using decades-old technique virus chemically inactivated injected patient prime immune system. second uses slightly different strain virus. 

According Chinese state media, countries placed orders least 140m doses two middle January, far shy total likes Oxford/AstraZeneca. However, Sinopharm grows order book substantially, would vindicate Beijing‚Äôs ambition develop state-backed companies globally competitive technology. 

The reputation Yang Xiaoming would also burnished. chairman Sinopharm‚Äôs vaccine business since 2015, Yang one public faces China‚Äôs Covid-19 research. doctor immunologist, spent five years late 1990s US National Institutes Health previously led national projects develop rotavirus Sars vaccines. 

The pandemic offers Sinopharm best chance decades prise open global market. group‚Äôs efforts date back Deng Xiaoping power. 

Sinopharm‚Äôs vaccine business founded 1989 house string research institutes dotted across China. international ambitions reached milestone 2013 World Health Organization approved jab Japanese Encephalitis. 

Sinopharm holds controlling stake six publicly traded entities ‚Äî two listed Hong Kong, including Sinopharm Holdings, four Chinese mainland. 

Despite limited uptake far outside China, Sinopharm wasted little time expanding ability manufacture Covid-19 vaccines. company, employs 150,000 people, expects able produce 1bn doses year, investing Rmb2bn. 

&amp;#x200B;

# question trust 

But vaccine become serious contender international stage, scientists said Sinopharm needs make fundamental change: stop relying Beijing give jabs credibility instead transparent trials data generated. 

‚ÄúIt heavy lifting \[Sinopharm\] establish brand reputation overseas,‚Äù said Jin Dong-Yan, virologist University Hong Kong. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs question trust, especially China starting nothing, never exported vaccines.‚Äù 

Jin said Sinopharm release explanation efficacy rate also sharing comprehensive data international regulators quickly possible. 

Doing would mark radical departure company remains supplier choice China‚Äôs state-subsidised vaccination programmes. controlled Assets Supervision Administration Commission sits State Council, China‚Äôs cabinet. Sinopharm directed requests comment Communist party, respond. 

With governments jostling finite supply vaccines, race inoculate billions bruising highly political one. Beijing made little secret Sinopharm‚Äôs jab doubles foreign policy tool. 

In February, Sinopharm‚Äôs deliveries, donated Beijing, included 500,000 Pakistan, 600,000 Cambodia 300,000 Peru Laos. Late last month, Hungary became first EU nation start using vaccine, prime minister Viktor Orban declaring preferred choice. 

That Sinopharm embraced likes Hungary stirring concern Europe see ‚Äúas geopolitical contest‚Äù, said Anthony Dworkin, senior research fellow European Council Foreign Relations. ‚ÄúOthers say we‚Äôre short vaccines vaccine legitimate interested in.‚Äù 

But western nations steering clear vaccines, Sinopharm‚Äôs best hope adding list buyers lies Asia Africa. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Covax hope 

The company January submitted application one vaccines included WHO‚Äôs Covax scheme, aims ensure populations low-income countries inoculated combining procurement efforts. 

China‚Äôs pledge 10m jabs Covax fraction 2bn doses initiative, struggled secure support wealthy nations, hopes distribute 2021. Covax signed deals BioNTech/Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax Sanofi. 

The bulk Sinopharm‚Äôs overseas orders negotiated directly countries developing world, vaccines face intense competition likes Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V Oxford/AstraZeneca. 

Establishing vaccines outside China would much-needed win Sinopharm, whose domestic grip threat privately owned competitors. company makes quarter vaccines private market, accounted 47 per cent total sales 2020, 23 per cent 2013, according National Institutes Food Drug Control. 

The rivals also eating Sinopharm‚Äôs lead Covid-19 vaccine. Last month, Sinovac‚Äôs two-shot vaccine received conditional approval mainland China emergency approval Hong Kong. CanSino granted conditional approval China last month interim phase 3 results put efficacy jab 65 per cent. 

Like Sinopharm, neither company released detailed data trials. absence deterrent some. 

G42 Healthcare, Sinopharm‚Äôs distributor Middle East north Africa, said Chinese company record developing inactivated vaccines met requirements timing delivery UAE. 

Securing overseas orders, however, merely start Sinopharm. company needs produce deliver jab ‚Äî process proved fraught pharma groups. 

It lauded Pakistan delivering 500,000 vaccines without charge, senior government officials told Financial Times number jabs Sinopharm actually administered modest compared rivals. 

‚ÄúThe bulk vaccines think come sources‚Äù Oxford/AstraZeneca Russia‚Äôs Sputnik V, said one Pakistani official. 

And although Sinopharm increased production capacity, vaccines Sinovac CanSino also approved, rollout jab home lagged behind targets set Beijing. persists, achieving international ambitions likely become even harder. Show country island authoritarian lockdowns work. I'm anti masker, republican. Well, flu pretty much non existent. would say COVID dangerous spread easily Yeah. 20% going first?

I‚Äôm glad see it‚Äôs confusing. 

Also 80% gross exaggeration according CDC criterion. keep saying ""bread"" something like that? ""Bree""? Wtf saying? doable. used manage wife's Ob/Gyn practice. would go 6 day work week, none Wed/Fri afternoon off, doable. Pfizer specifically say recipients vaccine maximum immunity 1 week second dose. guess that's longer considered true? Probably. seems typical country.

But seriously though slips better. both. I'd still like see actual studies locations, especially yet biological, clinical reasoning lethal variants. Like tired parent, I'm surprised, disappointed. we‚Äôve cured death now? saying ever famous black person say getting vaccine keep mouth shut?

if we're talking people skeptical vaccine, every right leaning rural pastor keep mouth shut too? skeptical demographics? bound rule express opinion? Practically, probably matter (for US) either way. deal backstop case mRNA vaccines run production issues, otherwise get first.

I hope US preparing quickly pivot distributing vaccines countries need, supply begins greatly outstrip demand here. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Edit:  know we're swimming doses (at least US).

If 70% adults want vaccine, 118m adults want vaccine initiated vaccination yet. We're getting 16m combined doses Pfizer Moderna week, important note good portion second doses. J&amp;J really stepped production *yet*. realistically we're something like 12m first doses week least next couple weeks.

If go free-for-all now, we're looking ~10 people vying first dose. limit vulnerable populations, probably cut competition half, lowering frustration people trying get appointments focusing efforts people worse outcomes.

Please tell part study doesn‚Äôt support fact Tcells last decades? ‚ÄúAll six previously known coronaviruses spark production antibodies memory cells. addition, studies immunity SARS-CoV-1 shown cells stick around many years longer acquired antibodies. So, Bertoletti‚Äôs team set gain better understanding cell immunity novel coronavirus.

Good you, Austin. Obviously brain cell exists city. 

We solid data yet. instance, trials, control groups ALSO two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It‚Äôs true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can‚Äôt draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes.  
As Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research [pointed Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.‚Äù She‚Äôs right. can‚Äôt confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.  
You see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. [Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group‚Äî**which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic.

lol, CDC says 10-day motorcycle rally South Dakota attended approximately 460,000 persons, **51** confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, five tertiary cases identified Minnesota residents. additional nine likely rally-associated secondary tertiary cases occurred. Four patients hospitalized, one died. Genomic sequencing supported associations motorcycle rally. Yes. terms vaccine development it‚Äôs mission accomplished now. talk diminished capacity boiled even Andy Slavitt said: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care people get sniffles.‚Äù keep hospital. Full stop.

The problem good data vaccines.  
Some trials many even people **PLACEBO** groups die end hospital, really significant data getting vaccine either. try give best summary studies read. stop though. like 85-90% ~14 days. 

The 50% total day 0 day 21. first 14 days people got shot get got covid pretty much rate. civil. Let's see, husbands working home, adult kids moved back in...yep gym doesn‚Äôt require it. going still wear month people vaccinated. think like 14 percent.

Per WaPo vaccine tracker like 50% prioritized (65+) population. Kids can't get vaccinated now, count, hospitalizations highest old people, close mostly vaccinated. Semantics important. EU claiming export ban outright lie. Sure UK isn‚Äôt currently exporting that‚Äôs due contractual arrangements fact reason production facilities UK due government funding. still equate ban. 

The USA ban exports, EU ability block UK introduced measures. UK similar measures place moment AZ meets contractual obligations UK export without Uk govt anything.

You claim it‚Äôs semantics like EU ones twisting facts fit perceived view it.  civil. I‚Äôm imagining crowded it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll awesome. That's odd, higher ed teachers time? interact number people... think don‚Äôt? Actually, millions younger people received vaccine.

Austin points. hear liberal attitude, great food, great music scene, bars, college town atmosphere big city.

But frankly overrated. Urban sprawl, bad (no, awful) traffic, high rent, low income families forced central part city long ago, especially east I35, rapidly gentrifying. One favorite hole-in-the-wall Tex-Mex places, basically converted house turned restaurant, long gone, replaced condos. Plus one worst homeless problems country.

Every time go back problems worse worse. Austin quite liberal utopia people make be. Makes sense keep bit longer large cities. like we're leaving local governments decide, though. tiny town Texas need restrictions Austin Houston. fiance second day. nothing, 102 degree fever, chills, aches pains, headache, diharea. 100% fine 24 hours later, crazy. 25 million doses exported February almost much EU received month (about 28 million). seems contagious period 10-14 days think understanding. vaccine, hospitalizations almost eradicated. Therefore organ failure. Go get vaccinated majority discussion / argument goes away. 

The consumer distribution channels seem getting vaccines better health care providers. Biontech already working Sanofi Germany set new site open Q3 Maybe Austin one day secede Texas... already packed hospitals, packed ICUs, lots virus still going around, approach makes sense. do, need prioritize demographic that's stressing medical system. absurd; US UK allow doses produced territory leave country. US population received shots

Good job! I'm also collecting COVID mementos little slips paper codes retrieve test results, pattern homemade mask, info sheet vaccine side effects. I'm neither retail worker teacher I'll one last get vaccine. wife teacher seen clinic, black Friday style rush try schedule vaccine CVS, that's Massachusetts Well can't use US facilities, US blocking exports.

Look percentage hospitalization age. lot higher elderly, been/are vaccinated.

No, pandemic's younger still get sick pass away. getting risk vaccinated means start move away restrictions.  posted another comment, way see J&amp;J efficacy data South Africa? data Israel UK (with literally millions participants) show mRNA vaccines much effective J&amp;J UK variant. question becomes, much J&amp;Js poor results South Africa? much it‚Äôs less effective vaccine overall? world clearly lack reading comprehension skills. never said 80k considered rich. one uses expression real life anyway. Seems prevalent among Fauci media. UK broken highly editorialised title? Clearly UK following different strategy splitting doses meeting 'fully' nicely thank you.

I wanted highlight differences strategies concrete numbers, criteria ""fully vaccinated"" something product ""my agenda"" (btw really? paranoid?). medical term see Britain's strategy work compared countries high rate fully vaccinated population.

Also mentioned Israel US used 2 doses Pfizer, UAE Serbia rolled mostly 2 doses Sinopharm vaccines interested non agenda based data, doses per 100 pop available site.

This agenda based data, *just* data different public information, data doses per 100 pop. Czechia here. almost number daily cases (15196 yesterday), even though fourth population. Crazy. British variant hit us like freight train.

But opposing mask mandates? That's nothing stupid, selfish dick-waving. Masks literally *no* downsides, overwhelming evidence save lives. masks, piece shit. Still it‚Äôs thank you.

Two tips: (1) bring bottle water sip (anxious breathing dry propel feelings drive anxiety) make sure well-hydrated. (2) access mild sedative consider taking appointment. True. know it‚Äôs complex. hate allows grifters like Alex berenson ability go Fox News claim vaccine hoax Hi there, I've done ton research fellow Kansan outside lack public updates think we're ok. 

Kansasvaccine.gov offers good updates multiple times updated weekly within current tier focused on.

Overall we're 16% Kansans vaccinated. comparison, Missouri right 16% (bit higher think) much higher population. Since vaccine numbers population, pretty good especially given pretty spread out.

As lack moving tiers, know areas ready go, tough decision understand want certain areas move forward. Missouri, people chasing vaccines rural areas meant local population.

That said, seems like Missouri politically based vaccine distribution Parsons sending rural areas. Even Mayor Q called FEMA step make sure equitable. maybe using bellwether best idea.

I‚Äôm rules following anyone be. I‚Äôm still waiting turn. state prioritized teachers everyone. Including people tier. Even though schools lower risk places. even though 39 year old three serious health conditions including damaged lungs, vaccine. watch 22 year old phys Ed teachers get mass vaccinations governor owes teacher union.

Once science replaced politics ethics tier system completely crumbles. I‚Äôm still toeing line resolve weakening. indoor dining isn‚Äôt really low risk even tables spread out. Would great one year 6 months ago Doubt it‚Äôs mostly vaccines yet. Deaths lag behind cases cases plummeting now. It‚Äôs natural deaths falling well.

Only concerning thing is, cases almost hit 100k single day despite roughly around 60-70k weekly average little bit. cases start going again, expect deaths follow afterwards mean tests cases reported independently one another, never know actual test positivity rate given day? Hey, explain think lifting mandate preventing sickness death? I'm extremely curious understand take controversial topic. Given less 10% people Texas vaccinated majority rest seem think hoax, lifting mandate recommendations professionals seems unlikely preventative. Doses also different. Possibly things I'm sure. Exactly usual, mental health overlooked pushed back burner. It‚Äôs disheartening.  sure discuss; I'm currently thin ice employer could sends edge. Hawaii, mask mandate like November December. grocery stores offices already mandating them, since like March. need governor's mandate that- place ever did. actual headlines often source misinformation well. don‚Äôt get it.

Thats hope think happen America done 1,030 tests per 1,000 citizens. Mexico done 40 tests per 1,000 citizens.

How? really way might able guess blinded randomized control study like set side effects vaccination. Joe Rogan left chat Good analogy, except we'd need global shortage Microsoft Apple, buying one gives markedly different chance getting sick dying.

Aside that, though, similar.   fall flu shot effect. Tetanus shot soreness several days, bad. slept 10 hours night arm sore next morning. That‚Äôs it. great lol.

3 weeks? Dreamworld. rough estimate people age right 3 years, *any* vaccine. Moderna two shot series. helps, IM (intramuscular) IV (intravenous), chance blow another vein. assure word use bit stronger. That's still 50% coverage. talk 90 percent effective 45 days vaccination supposedly 100% preventing death serious illness (like others) Yes, possible June would good month hold event. without advanced warning, hard set up. Harder events others. need know least month pushing it. week leading March 14th insane, 14th date head husband cancel honeymoon trip night supposed leave. 

The sad suitcase sat half unpacked living room floor weeks. chose mRNA vaccine believe difference effectiveness could significant fighting existing future variant covid. sure correct. You‚Äôre gonna sad issue huh  Hey, two really same. Seriously, Cruz slimy. I'd MUCH rather do-nothing neolib senator Rogan lives Austin might pay attention still know enough correct say dude moron presumably walking alone. go airport, lot low-wage workers working close contact public. workers demographic people travel spring break, least high risk. least living high-risk people. 

They get airplanes, served flight attendants, also working close contact public may also high-risk live high-risk people. 

And they‚Äôll party Cancun, get COVID, fly back, spreading virus even workers, may either die give family members die. become disabled give someone else become disabled. spring break vacationers never know many, attend funerals. come back home COVID, get quickly, say ‚ÄúI great vacation! Yeah, got COVID, got quickly, it‚Äôs big deal!‚Äù Speaking honestly, anyone begun entertain certain ideas/theories world society pandemic previously would scoffed at? ü§î Ton people sharing cavax links. even ask qualify, anyone link make appointment. school district person since August. 

Four teachers died. 

Many gotten terribly sick gone hospital. One particular vent month able teach another year. not. Moderna Pfizer seem significantly under-performing projections. also provided additional J&amp;J allocations next week. possible many additional doses sent programs? CVS conducted pop-up clinic, explicitly said second dose would them. I've trying find volunteer opportunities friends later phases could hopefully get unused doses. opportunities seem hard find around here, know volunteers many sites somehow! Agreed. responding question damage asymptomatic cases. I‚Äôm less afraid covid killing chance developing long covid organ damage diminished quality life.

You read much severe covid vs flu, death rate health complication rates. prevent deaths Covid 100% time. yeah. I'm trying scare anyone away. People free make choices. least be. Unlike case last 12 months. Nope. Looks like provinces might make happen federal goal always Sept adults want one get one. general, second dose sent got first dose. put date back card well explain specifics. doses actually received 3 days date, someone called 6 days advance schedule time.  Oh yeah? coincidentally happens 4 populated states order well threw tiers window announcing new eligible groups ~~that thinks help re-election campaign~~ That's covid past. now. 80% deaths protected vaccinated right 20% people. April 1st covid resembles heavy flu geared towards younger. June 1st resembles cold. could order though part order meaningless. yea rate california vaccinating people, entirety alaska would vaccinated like 3 days worst still, alaska logistical challenges, good thing theyre able meet challenges regardless got around 2 pm. fine around 11:30 night got cold chills trouble sleeping after. felt weak sore next day small fever. 24 hours shot feeling way better back normal today besides sore arm. Austin pretty dope. We‚Äôll fine without you. I‚Äôd recommend take peek per capita means statistical discussion No, I'm group socially distanced stayed indoors past year wife received vaccines. going start tweaking formula vaccine allocation depending differences vaccine hesitancy states? states damn near impossible find appointment eligible seniors, states opening eligibility 18 year olds. Fuck people. People always gonna complain, we‚Äôve gotta makes sense. Sometime soon, already, bangin shots whoever shows going best strategy. think shit goes away? That‚Äôs bedrock South built FFS. Alaskan know Sarah Palin Part mandate allows companies still require masks, can‚Äôt make customer wear mask mandate says private property still enforce trespassing laws refuse wear mask business keeps mandate. Absolute values aren‚Äôt useful unless adjust population might give rough idea states open everyone. Alaska 25%, states slightly beloiw 20%. However, Alaska quite young quite conservative, states might get 30% so. actively masks?  political differences opinions might him, makes Joe Rogan moron?  Pretty sure we‚Äôre talking modern day Also got overabundance supply, get allotment per person like states, flat allotment native Alaskan groups got allotment impact allotments.

Same happens states high native American population, see going phases faster also today‚Äôs case vaccination numbers? lazy check rn  read article linked here? Well TIL. /s  matter one is, sides agree dont like abbott Good question. work Walgreens. can‚Äôt speak nationwide, locally scheduling vaccinations online via hotline individuals access computer. central location set appointments up, distributes doses appropriate stores. really great scheduling method, get make appointment first dose, also make 2nd dose appointment 28 days later. I‚Äôm sure might able get lucky secure dose calling, likely viable option vast majority population. Plus, may able guarantee would able receive second dose.  open vaccines gen pop Moderna study here, arm hurting like flu shot felt. Figured got placebo, nope got real thing. Seems alot ppl know injection spot pain. Holy shit, people understand MUCH GET AWAY understand one simple rule of

Fine. Makes ton practical sense. intentionally omitting hard fact J&amp;J inferior product. is. debate. problem watching try blow smoke ass again. I‚Äôll happily take inferior product contribute greater goal, don‚Äôt fucking sit adamantly insist I‚Äôm receiving lesser vaccine. am. vaccine given black people. comparison even make sense.  vaccine given everyone around world. Current COVID Cases:

Coo coo coo bad texas gerrymandered, austin part district represented anyone right, fact split technically 'republican' even city can't stay midnight book

If one stay midnight book, expanding eligibility ain't gonna shit increasing number vaccinations. People weak chins/ugly teeth love masks too. welcome good side do, we're busy spending $135m National Endowment Arts, $135m National Endowment Humanities, $200m Institute Museum Library Services, Covid relief bill.

Just can't find $210m required tests anywhere. Big shocker Austin's reputation liberal really exaggeration. liberal sense Democrats Republicans represent liberalism political ideology. Austin votes blue reason urban area; find education population. progressive social attitudes, lacks progressive economic attitudes, really amount much aesthetic. Right, point there‚Äôs single place throwing stones. got source? Canadian reading makes want cry. 

I‚Äôm angry jealous Americans point makes bitter, lot family haven‚Äôt seen almost two years mental health steep decline, would anything able live life normally makes tear get emotional thinking able feel normal scared shitty. can't disagree FDA's application EUA, I'm expert. trust judgement.

I'm thankful medicine advanced able get vaccine quick did. I'm scheduled Pfizer one April trying see switch 1 shot JNJ sooner overnight. Lol. Throw away masks people, children get covid almost never die What?  Indiana already 55!   booked trip West (Colorado) early August still feel fairly confident vaccinated then, I'm pretty much last tier vaccinated (which fair, telework underlying issues). mean technically feel like travel become free anyway (looking @ u people see Instagram) responsible quarantine-free/vaccinated travel feel like mid June, incorporating time need vaccine effective. booked everything refundable case still feel optimistic guess airlines ""never forget"" Huh? never told anyone handle anything, called misinformed ways interpreting data. single sentence post telling anyone handle health

The vast, vast majority mild/asymptomatic cases don‚Äôt result long-term damage, absolutely scientific studies claim otherwise

Waiting week two get vaccine that‚Äôs slightly effective asymptomatic disease (and takes longer get peak efficacy) equivalent driving hundred miles gas 2 cents cheaper There‚Äôs still active stay home order? Serious question fuck allowed export? would tell family friends covid invited get lunch house? flu 9 months viable option concerned symptoms opposed death bring teachers colorado ? 
Can't vaccinate home states? $hit. people trust government odds policies, becomes harder take restrictions seriously see dominance flu US sunshine states, end winter: Vitamin seasonality measures States? Perhaps would show something.  It‚Äôs interesting point. Morally challenging issue. Risk patient vs rights people employment despite medical condition makes unable get vaccinated. gods name article April 2020 Nationwide, CDC showing 123 million doses distributed 94 injected -- means 29 million doses ... somewhere. covid? following guidelines taking precautions putting others risk well yourself. Much like impaired driving. all. biggest point vaccine herd immunity. far less likely catch covid 3 months even vaccine since many people around already got one. Getting 65% effective vaccine versus 95% effective one 3 months simple comparing 65% 95%. Getting less effective vaccine earlier likely reduce overall risk more. guess want technical people covid-19 disease. hope though. Thus coronavirus mutate much flu. vaccine could wipe out. Additionally, mRNA vaccines game-changer could far-reaching impacts protect viruses could even used protect flu colds.

I see saying. prefer optimistic view though. Why? everyone wants vaccinated July hospitalizations super low seem needed There's really going many people state eligible now. Anyone BMI 25 eligible, exactly slimmest states.  flag ""good news""? lot opinions mask mandates lifted shoehorning bias flair conducive good conversation. again, Canada hides face embarrassment. already taken account, official toll 160k deaths news local newspapers think may 50% underreporting most, would 240k deaths max nothing Soreness spot injection. passed within hours.

Stop conflating shit acting like that's I'm going after. I'm questioning decision hand cash someone make $79k. I'm sorry simply understand logic. going people lost jobs/lost wages/had salary reductions, course I'd understand. unpredictable event harmed many people never felt like people ACTUALLY needed help got it.

I know endless amount pain event, think we've done terrific job solve it. currently halfway March thing gonna done 45 days. I'm questioning timing, I'm questioning methods, I'm questioning lot things. 

And thoughts wholly fundamentally separate empathy towards people struggling. I'm allowed ask questions/have discussion around 2 Trillion (with t) worth government spending, guess I'll move along. yes keep energy defense spending etc. bloated fucking madness can't fucking borrow forever. old job nurse come every year give everyone flu shots free always got one. Since switched jobs like five years ago haven't. should, mean to, put forget it. state 60 up, 5 year increments. adults don‚Äôt even understand Covid feel like armchair opinions reading mainstream media makes expert.  sure see connection here. CDC federal government thinks fast, need start releasing realistic timetables rolling back restrictions week. We're supposed enough vaccine doses everyone two half months, far advice coming down. Basically one cares mandates. gonna wear mask, did. wait governor tell you. Private offices mostly instituted own. gonna wait governor. gonna wear mask institute one office, weren't.

They really made differencein restaurants stores, choice wear one one people otherwise.

And yeah, probably accounts like 2%. soon Chosen People Israel gets one that's less effective virus longterm effects y'all getting vaccines? thought still 1a??? Oh man got Japanese vaccine. Someone messed shipments. Bill going happy Kenichiro moving territory. It‚Äôs quite clear bias lies, he‚Äôs using state national constitutions decision making. That‚Äôs never seen federal mask mandate, it‚Äôs simply unconstitutional.

Bring Black Widow!!! clear it‚Äôs 2 percent everyday? thought might cumulative every weeks clear think you‚Äôre looking wrong numbers.
I believe 5.12% number includes fully vaccinated Bloomberg separating out! Check time period growth rate reported for. 2% daily 2% total rather significantly different end results. young healthy people get one? far know still 1a. really put bee bonnet. wonder why? seriously overreacting totally relevant article strange. ""other side"" here? side people want spread diseases sicken people? Worrying important issues see. thing could throw basically 10% Hawaii's population active duty military knows many retirees military. DoD VA taking care shots, they'll probably completely done end month.

When extra ""shadow"" 10% population vaccinated reported state, that's going effect numbers, too. big effect.

Hawaii pretty decent place weather storm...except jobs lost comparatively tourism, course. Screaming matches come. I'm going May 11. Let's hope I'm wrong earlier that. know works America, buy insurance that. One governor advisers reporting Covid information him. responsible well-being state statewide mandates. chief police anywhere near information coming opinions. surely understand governor releasing state wide stranglehold going cause conflict among areas still could use mask mandates, chief police business going national ‚Äúnews‚Äù discuss medical side Covid. He‚Äôs random Joe opinion. guess slam CNN desperate narrative anything else. eu invested roughly uk population 9x size. importantly, doing? vaccine turns death sentence cold, winning. next tiniest violin. Ezreal Pretty sure he‚Äôs troll. middle school statistics. IIRC they're also testing effectiveness taking second dose J&amp;J later. 

So worst case scenario, get J&amp;J one already great, maybe road say ""hey, come get booster"" see anyone calling antimask stuff. Unless thought joking great guest. second thought I‚Äôm good staying home another 6 months. keep Well thing is, anti-maskers people irrationally restrictions back needed often used mental health excuse. That's whole ""the cure deadlier virus"" mantra came - idea wear mask social distance would somehow drive people madness amount resulting suicides would dwarf amount people would die Covid.

Now things getting better actually let restrictions go, there's sort ""crying wolf"" type effect going idea people say mental health justifies easing restrictions wrong engrained people's minds hard they're stuck mindset.  So, handled virus better country world, perfect discontented people imagined.

Well, then, must review.

Meanwhile, places like Texas, throwing caution wind plutocrats cut back luxuries. Garland, TX chose enforce first put place. Cities make decisions, whether they're right wrong that's supposed work. probably go back politics sub Texas largest state population though, bro.


Texas also shithole outside cities. don‚Äôt shop in-person anything, haven‚Äôt eaten restaurant year, saw family one day edge driveway Christmas.

So no. things. go work go home. Joe Rogan idiot thumb. weird people act like every state got amount lol. would ever first conclusion come to? 

That said, [Alaska get slightly bigger proportionate amount.] Still enough downplay achievement, though. looks higher batches Iowa we're real per day deaths 0-2 people. 7 day death total 11 32 monthly high February. 

The winds change definitely blowing end pandemic horizon thanks vaccines allowing us expedite building immunity population protecting vulnerable Thank you. guess know soon predictions accurate. be. June so. know it‚Äôll sound say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs pill now‚Äù supply would gone weeks. need release lot supply low cases due vaccine. Name one lmao point comparing states unless normalize metric account many people within state seemed like bars requiring though. saw clips city's subreddit showed clubs carrying like normal.

Basically think wanted find things restrictions enforced, possible. case national apparently state level Texas, blue areas ones driving economy? don‚Äôt think GA worst they‚Äôre definitely good tries make like are. ""Not one us"" -Peter Gabriel think mean ""verify"" ""explain"". Obviously leave home can't magically get COVID unless someone else live leaves home.

As written title suggests challenging biotic origins life germ theory disease one go. do? Abbott's EO bans jail punishment local pandemic-related ordinances. Cities enacting ordinances negated EO (such mask mandate) still issue penalties, fines.

Seriously, people need stop opining they've actually [read damn 95% sure sounds way better 65% Youre joking right? Abbott already hates us.

 


""Once cross Travis County line, starts smelling different. know fragrance is?

This half joke Fort Worth went blue 2020, barely. Essential workers age get vaccinated. I'm educator 65 got first shot week ago. March 15, anyone 16+ certain health conditions get too.

I'm confident able get shots end April, early May absolute latest. 

Do remind bot, whatever, I'll bet get first appointment 3rd week April. get pfizer/moderna 95%? data cherrypicked, numbers going one weekend half many reports filed.

Yep! Geographically austin real small city. Houston, DFW, SA, spread out, massive population also land size. Austin weird sense feels like town, like metropolitan city. love here. SA HOU far distance, feel like completely different Austin. Literally discussing deaths cases. Thanks though. Congress? mean State Legislature? largest city country largest city state needed excess end-to-end vaccine delivery capability. That's situation we're right places. private business refuse service, outside it‚Äôs theater. Stop arguing gets first. start getting shots arms get rid virus.

I guess grand scheme things doesn‚Äôt matter much.

Racist areas less likely categorize something hate crime, even less likely convict guilty charges.

So # hate crimes seems like it‚Äôd good indicator, it‚Äôs really not. cases climbing areas, regardless even mask mandates came in. mask compliance 80% mandated areas since July aren‚Äôt yeah y‚Äôall need google bethel ohio. 

that‚Äôs every small town least illinois philly can't hate crimes report it.
kinda like people believe Sweden rape capital world reality broader definition actually register cases. hard people.

Ah yes, Intel style Vaccine distribution. chalked low flu numbers lot social distancing, working home, everything shut down. everything open full capacity I'm sure well masks work.  Exactly, shouldn‚Äôt matter state mandate removed local ones still gonna stay. point, lot people wear masks stores work school it‚Äôs harder to, required there, mandate basically can‚Äôt enforced. Masks basically become cultural issue that‚Äôs held place social pressure, social pressure go away point regardless government mandates. morons like person allows shit gain traction.

For crap indian health takes.... 

This impressive. weird thing Israel they've really stressing getting people double doses. even though they're near 100 doses per 100 people, 55% given least one dose. looks like retrospect might've better try prioritize getting everyone first dose, like Canada trying do. Also correlation rural areas higher 65+ demographics (some rural states 50%). Likely 1A/1B jobs well. instance there's much manufacturing/energy/housing construction jobs rural areas less gig economy jobs. feel bit like punishment though considering urban areas much social interaction. really need vaccinating may routinely see anyone outside household neighbors houses even sight can't walk outside without seeing dozens people even former higher risk?

The answer: course not. Well yeah, two shots that's one. Yes, yes, I've got little black book Satire. requirement small town basically dropped already. ‚Äúofficially‚Äù first 2 weeks. city school officials started actively trying get people take vaccine basically saying ‚Äúif want one go get it‚Äù.

The online documents still show eligible group. I‚Äôve told multiple people aren‚Äôt groups got vaccine ‚ÄúAnyone 16 get it.‚Äù wanted go today still feel requirements posted everywhere fitting it. would interesting see poll every month till May. guess weather NE gets warmer less less people going mask May nice enough everywhere outside people start feel pressure put mask down. Warm weather inevitable CDC guideline saying vaccinated don‚Äôt need masks peer pressure flip people feel need unmasked. 

airplanes different world require masks germ tubes. Last time flu got flu. Never N-95 flights. family? /s? go bring common sense this? Can't see we're trying righteously indignant here? Weather man could try honest.... sayin probably business related reason

Yeah like UK Government signing license revoked tend agree. Also, mostly low-risk people getting COVID people dying going hospital, really big concern?

Obviously every death bad want anyone go hospital, would hate see someone suffer long term effects COVID. However, weigh negative effects restrictions likelihood things happen. I'm expert, feel like we'll soon see things fine Texas country follow. Given sheer number places delivering vaccine, possible accounts true. Yes, thank you. 

No, Trudeau didn‚Äôt make recommendation. worry Canadian medical experts political decision based around lack vaccines. Better spike protein, efficient friendly Floridian remind people many counties cities Florida mask mandate place since June, even earlier, despite lack state mandate. mandates still effect compliance high.

Rings true many developed countries struggling COVID-19 right now. US, developed countries, get COVID-19 control, pool resources together use infrastructure start helping less wealthy nations effectively. china, thank nothing guardian good media outlet quite pro-EU stance. lazy read article time here's key points 
"" 23 mutations genetic code - relatively high number - made far easily spread. Scientists say 40%-70% transmissible previous dominant variants circulating. "" 


"" infection new variant led 227 deaths sample 54,906 COVID-19 patients, compared 141 among number patients infected variants. ""

"" Lawrence Young, virologist professor molecular oncology Warwick University, said precise mechanisms behind higher death rate B.1.1.7 variant still clear, ‚Äúcould related higher levels virus replication well increased transmissibility‚Äù. ""  


(this last bit article interpreted information given)  


It's reason deadlier unknown, find anywhere article reason transmissible variants last line states strain transmissible others.  
(it states mutations potentially blame mention parts could influence infectivity.) Alaska like porn. done set do, pretty disgusted whole thing. ‚Äúcould related higher levels virus replication well increased transmissibility‚Äù thought figured viral load factor already? learn lesson hundred times everyone get page? I‚Äôm trying patient it‚Äôs hard vaccinated folks go back living younger healthier individuals keep towing line. Wish they‚Äôd open everyone like Alaska 60+ people issues setting appointments Alaska too. play fuckfuck games. Vaccine eligiblity goes go apply.

I'm 28, good shape, essential worker, first dose March 17. coworkers husband 60 asthma appointment sign up. 

It's efficient let people actively looking vaccine get one track risk people force them. immunodeficiency? one live offers 66% effectiveness. Kind feels pointless TBH... want safe yeah Got first shot today WOOP disapproval pledge vote ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù. It‚Äôs even pledge vote guy disapprove of. It‚Äôs statement disapproval.

I would say ‚Äúdisapprove‚Äù whole bunch non covid related reasons, voted him, almost assuredly vote again. Hell yea mess. neglected planned all. everyone gets fight it.... stores businesses orgs fighting even Qarens ... ""But mah governor said need masks anymore! blah blah"". 

Lovely. Thanks Abbot. love Hawaii. warned want move there. Everyone there. Staring one beautiful places earth it‚Äôs hard to.

Personally, get first shot 3/26 really don‚Äôt want stuck home another 9 months cause doesn‚Äôt want get it. offered plenty solutions original comment, like would rather try pressure someone else something they're comfortable with. reasoning works at-risk patients may unable get vaccine feels comfortable wearing mask. perfectly valid. u buy stock company last week Depends location. got first shot day opened age veterans area. Waiting second dose now. Gives piece mind younger serious service connected health issues corona would likely kill me. state non-essential, healthy thirty-somethings first vaccinated? work laboratory. larger (30-50+) person meetings canceled last year, in-person meetings 10-20 person range couple times week. makes feel better, we‚Äôve positive COVID cases pop holding meetings, nobody else got sick far know. 

Get dad either wear good quality (KN95/N95) mask, and/or insist Windows kept open allow airflow. would also best either takes break alone, limits outdoor socializing couple people tops. shouldn‚Äôt socialize anyone cough mentions feeling ill.

I‚Äôve last 12+ months infected. I‚Äôve lucky, think odds favor well. Thats ok, just, doesn‚Äôt anything age people can't get vaccinated age. mean, that's discussion. Wearing mask good. wearing mask bad. It‚Äôs opinion. It‚Äôs science. It‚Äôs fact Oh right. big drop yesterday. ass never said that.

Have good day dude. 
This study itself. actually half percent daily...so adds up. TBH think much talk masks quotes Fauci masks important vaccine would presume more, data show shows.  opinion mine. Ageism wrong. yet covid still exists.... obviously read wrote. say Californians moving Texas, said one wishes Texas. Lots people moving California increasingly popular getting expensive live there.

Also, trying make single incident sound small. single incident massive people power several days rank mismanagement texas government. 

Have good one! RemindMe! 3 months bothered it?

Because makes therapy difficult, don‚Äôt want find another therapist I‚Äôve working person last 5 years, they‚Äôre good therapist I‚Äôve ever had.

Sorry it‚Äôs plainly obvious talking another human emotionally intense context harder wearing masks. also don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre approaching good faith, eat shit. I‚Äôm glad keeps dying going hospital, prefer get sick all. imagine catch even vaccine still feel like worst flu like symptoms life. bad ""free press"" spreading misinformation effective. Never. open month closed everything later came second ""opening."" 10 percent vulnerable though None things mentioned detrimental people's health. always liked anti-lockdown posts anti-vax stuff earned unfollow me. know actual numbers are, people get shot better. 

There people said get available think chips people realize vaccines making people spontaneously buy microsoft products think less skeptics might think.

But I'm also rando idk That‚Äôs perfectly fine would feel way lived area. I‚Äôm talking hope fails prove point Yeah come around back Walgreens tonight ask Julio. believe appointments already booked OH. know mother lives OH 50-59 age group set appointment soon announced Thursday they'd begin administering younger group. indication did? care getting vaccine ? We've neighborhood 75% administered nationally past weeks. fluctuates time big deliveries come in. unexpected given weekly deliveries going size, see administration start catch distribution week two it'll quite concerning. Coach Z, jerk! I‚Äôve listening Jha. He‚Äôs great. problem don‚Äôt think anybody honesty thinks ‚Äúa weeks‚Äù government going say it‚Äôs clear. Although seems he‚Äôs implying. Yeah, watched roll out, definitely agree you. Kind fumbled start.

I‚Äôm healthy 20 year old, also work around lot covid (especially really really bad felt like every patient covid) felt slightly bad, time Ohio slowly opening elderly people vaccinating everyone nursing homes, good thing.

I‚Äôm grateful dad finally get it, it‚Äôs promising they‚Äôve already opened 50+ since many older people already gotten theirs! mean, could say freelance work finance something. think anyone's checking. There‚Äôs reason believe stadiums full people kicked Italy‚Äôs first big spike Now. MIL eligible Ohio considering driving get it. Yeah, vacation time... Agreed. Means end.Given choice rigid sake consistency flexible protect human rights, hope always choose latter.

It's like ones we're fighting principles speak of, seems silly play game one hand tied behind backs people qualms using anything everything power keep us down.

Time away filibuster, pass election reform see Republicans really fare can't cheat anymore. Maybe. Mostly likely she'd get inside scoop best spray tan places. There‚Äôs gig ping isn‚Äôt going great cus distance interesting, thought people would view JJ second class vaccine, FB group I'm 100K people NJ trying find vaccine appts FULL people exclusively trying get It‚Äôs removed  Yeah doesnt seem like theres much situation. Luckily think main priority getting needles arms vs strictly enforcing phases. I‚Äôd imagine number people great enough warrant serious investigations that. Def likely die fatty Covid tho. Good Get shot many arms possible hit herd immunity ASAP think kind breaking point signals vast majority people (or possibly everyone) pandemic congregate without masks without fear? feel like real breaking points (and breaking point, mean sharp shift downwards risk/situation) Moderna vaccine announced highly effective, us personally gets vaccinated. really can't think anything else future objectively considered breaking point even anxious among us problem public.

It seems like vaccinations proliferate, Covid numbers gradually go (with small rises times I'm sure), would make clear-cut time we're like ""Ok, we're good now."" understand virus never go away course, that's really I'm talking about. new record year Poland, they're saying stay way May.

What joke... F\*ck government. anything stop this, putting measure lockdown go effect 10-14 days announced. point? RIGHT AWAY! big study (1.2M people) Israel weeks ago supports basically ""full"" immunity (92%) 7 days second shot. study cited article different somewhat group, saying get 89% protection 7-14 day window second shot. pretty minor difference. I'm ok vaccinating seniors first, make larger portion COVID deaths easier check eligibility based age. Adding professions deciding teachers important bus driver, Publix worker, sanitation engineer making complicated. 

I feel bad pharmacists trying keep eligible whatever random forms/documentation supposed provided. Yep. Gov. Abbott ass Mask mandates removed 12:01am morning.

Try harder. Ohh well thats case since many 2 shot vaccines yes probably hit 200m people learn anything initial messaging masks? Guess  I‚Äôm positive 200M adults want vaccine. issue state restrictions eligibility. I‚Äôd get one today could, probably won‚Äôt able least another 2 months.  anyone else fly Alaska get vaccinated? think thats going slow anything all.

Most people know want vaccine would prefer J&amp;J 1 shot. There's talking people. see people Twitter still convinced US botching rollout entirely. course look data countries anything. We‚Äôre stupid here.... Never assume local sources accurate Texas. two flavors media moment:

1: like reopening we're going post positive

2: like reopening we're going spin accordingly looking entire USA... go state state, I'll find plenty examples exact opposite MD. Now, entire discussion solely based MD, bad. 

Europe US one massive difference allow 4th peak US. called vaccine. distribution absolute disaster Europe.

(Looking appointment NC? Currently WakeMed tons appointments open Groups 1-3 early Saturday. need sign WakeMed MyChart account first--but this, even WakeMed patient.)  thought goal shots administered, adults fully vaccinated?

Anywhere else Texas feel welcomed Austin felt miserable, unwelcome, like walk egg shells times. Yes, study Israeli vaccination indicates decent protective effect first shot (+21 days), practically ""full"" immunity 7 days second shot. Israeli study larger cohort Danish study (but studies big enough expect n make difference).  Denton voted stop fracking town, Texas overruled it. year lot overruling cities handling Covid. (Here Dallas often meant interfering Covid restrictions.) considers placing Austin police department state control.  Way selectively read comment there, shooter. I'm mere shit-disturber.

Half-assed lockdowns useful hurt small local businesses. week mask requirements removed?? I'm shocked. could see believing stupid bullshit immunity shit.

I check CVS every day always look Puerto Rico's vaccine appt availability. always seems quite good, I'm guessing they'll soon expand eligibility. 

Luckily 94 year old grandfather lives able get already. publicity campaign result definitely positive story regardless. People lie vaccinated already going anyway. nothing change, vaccinated people wearing masks don‚Äôt need to. logical reason continue wear mask jerkoffs anti-vax would also stop wearing masks claim got vaccine asked. people need understand arm pain caused vaccine injection antibodies starting react vaccine. depending inmune responde arm may mildly hurt 1-2 days. It‚Äôs good pain tho! Couldnt take weekend trip get vaccinated? It‚Äôs pretty fun place live. probably depends much jerk enjoy being. second sentence literally implies sarcasm first one. can't sign parents 2nd dose walgreens. says use sign form exactly they're eligible 2nd dose, guess limiting people signing within 3 days. seems bit unfair since walgreens let sign parents 1st 2nd dose time. seems also ripe people forgetting take 2nd dose. missing something here?  Florida second oldest population country, 8th densest state, done better 25 states terms deaths COVID. Maybe New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Arizona, Delaware, Ohio, Pennsylvania etc done things like Florida. saying ""bruh"", like ""bro"". shit takes time. America ahead almost every country including big European countries. didnt read headline like year ago? driver make complaint police dept. well would look like holding back 3 shots every shot given. see acceleration shots week, people need start screaming it. How's broadband infrastructure? get decent ping Anchorage LOL NA servers Chicago? 200m adult Americans want vaccine rn imo don‚Äôt know long term effects virus, truly don‚Äôt know Covid dangerous more. Also, would still want kids get COVID Got it. simultaneously know many vaccines bring vaccinate X zip code, also know many bring vaccinate ""some random public park.""

Okay, mate. every 43 year old short, fat, bald man...there middle-schooler waiting tell dirty jokes. point can't imagine anyone would roll back restrictions. find places johnson? exactly 24 hours shot, hurt.

I 24 hours first moderna shot, hoping soreness eases soon. said, symptom I've experienced thus far. hospitalizations drop significantly lock downs? 

their last lockdown started december 24 within three weeks case count doubled going blame lockdown also? ended first week feb within three weeks numbers dropped precipitously...so would think lockdown caused cases drop causing cases rise? Alaska state within US ability circumvent federal policy donate vaccine stock ""other countries."" lot high risk people 50 J&amp;J vaccine also currently administered SA part wider implementation study. feel like will. Everywhere look number doses delivered significantly doses administered day-to-day basis. Hence many states expanding eligibility rapidly. 

As stands, states BMI smoking, list occupations long arm qualify you. rapidly getting point damn-near everyone eligible. 

I feel pain irony though!! Back Feb read Obesity co-morbidity Covid. decided whip behind shape. went Obese Overweight normal weight, losing 57lbs. irony dieted way vaccine shot lost me. many patients adamantly getting vaccine (often times saying even ASK) I‚Äôve almost come point don‚Äôt even bother asking more. 

Please keep asking! Every extra person vaccinated one person potentially saved, may best source accurate information world designed misinform them!

What specialty mind asking? Sounds like family internal?

ETA: Thanks work btw, know must really stressful time work hospital there's way could weather crisis without people like you. :) NOS liveblog: Pfizer trekt levering naar voren, maar levert geen extra tegenstelling tot wat de Europese Commissie en het ministerie van VWS eerder vandaag beweerden, gaat Pfizer g√©√©n 4 miljoen extra doses leveren aan de Europese Unie. ""Door verbeterde effici√´ntie kunnen sneller leveren onder de bestaande overeenkomst"", zegt een woordvoerder van Pfizer tegen de NOS. ""Er zijn zodoende geen 'extra' doses, ze vallen binnen de overeengekomen 500 De 169.000 coronavaccins die Nederland de komende weken meer geleverd krijg dan eerder afgesproken zijn dus een versnelde levering van vaccins die al eerder besteld waren. Eerder vandaag zei voorzitter van de Europese Commissie, Ursula Von der Leyen, dat de EU extra vaccins heeft onderhandeld, zo staat het ook het persbericht van de Na vragen van de NOS bevestigt Europese Commissie dat er geen extra doses worden geleverd. Een woordvoerder zegt dat Von der Leyen bedoelde ""extra bovenop de leveringen het eerste kwartaal."" got J&amp;J 16 hours ago (super happy receive them!) woke small headache, chills, aches, manageable.

If makes feel better, I'm Pennsylvania, governor f*cking vaccine distribution badly, Democrats starting turn 2022 also gubernatorial election us, want messing Democratic candidates chances.

One thing---I read 120m doses would distributed March, seems we're lagging tiny bit? personally believe March last year started become main stream problem.

Residents awaiting headline, ‚ÄúTexas #1 cause new coronavirus surge. Statewide shutdown.‚Äù Narrative? thought adding joke, sometimes weird sense humor. appointment required, also Texas residency required O:-)

like peeps Denver literally drive 6 hours way get jabbed Amarillo. nuttier squirrel shit, tell ya margaritas excellent, love spinach enchiladas. concern trolling, rules. Try facts, mate. understand two things here. First isolation possible certain industries. Second prevention measure short complete isolation 100 percent effectiveness. Even wore masks without question, disease would still spread exponentially, slower. would make pandemic last longer, lower peak. call ""flattening curve"".

It's basic math actually understand prevention equal 100 percent stopping spread. possible feasible. Ideally, sure, work practically real world. never were. knew would lying day 1. continue lie WHO, continue waste tax dollars continue lie this.

And bots &amp; shills continue downvote anything critical mother China reddit well. surprise. Opening day 4 weeks away hopefully vaccine distribution gets ramped even then. also going social-distance sections, opening day reason (money assume). anyone mind explaining *definitively* say vaccine cause death? I'm anti-vaxx anything, curious say vaccine cause organ failure supposedly healthy person like saying ""there's way guarantee people drink drive we're going anything curb it"".

It's absolutely something control much better have, there's every reason believe got bad political leadership actively spreading disinformation. we're getting back potentially leader combating CV there's every reason believe we'll get countries follow suit.

Honestly, kind numbers really keep dropping. one going want visit business countries nothing contain virus.

And again, saying goes experts saying every virus. Taking every reasonable precaution slow spread absolutely right move pay dividends. Failure means might well forget human race, *will* last Coronavirus impact humanity. actual mandates exist scenario? dad's gf retired nurse, volunteering local health department since end January started vaxxing city, definitely one &amp; people National Guard getting trained give too. Sorry, bracketed disclaimer make clear enough joking? People got pfizer feel effects? can‚Äôt speak states NJ much better job federal retail program (about 80-90 percent state sites verse 50 percent federal retail programs. said doses state facilities). average daily vaccines distributed 3 million. half weeks ago (before storms). average daily vaccines administered time 1.6 million day. excuse 2.5 million day now. CONGRATS!!! data protection offered one Moderna shot? Esp. 14 days?

One study suggested something order 75% efficacy around two weeks first shot, would order protection would get single J&amp;J dose. original Moderna trial also showed vaccine recipients 90% less likely infected control group two weeks first dose receiving second dose. However, would take grain salt - sample sizes *really* small data gathering necessarily rigorous post-second-dose Moderna trial resulted approval, would personally take ""it probably provides good protection we're sure *exactly* much concerned reaction shot?

No. Lots people side effects, especially first question 2: I've taking ivermectin weekly since November, including hours vaccinated (I took company several dozen people vaccination site, decent distancing *most* time noticeable ventilation).

You probably taking invermectin unless doctor recommended serologic test reveal whether vaccine effect?

Serology test [not reliable tell vaccine protective (""People vaccinated may interested getting serology test, see vaccine ‚Äúworked,‚Äù vaccinated person likely get negative result serology test, even vaccine successful protective."") provide much value you. Well we're gonna see plays out. really hope goes well things come back addition, they‚Äôll changing stadium name Globe Death Field. think it‚Äôs good time take masks off.

Teachers get vaccinated federal program Kroger Meijer, unless 50+. also remember seeing something smokers added eligibility list, perhaps change never rolled out.

As someone hates politics state, extremely happy vaccination rollout. rate we're vaccinating considering future doses, shocked 50-75% capacity Indy 500 year. I'd say 100% I'm sure rest states, plus international ticket holders defer tickets 2022 sell since see us reopening border fall. replies twitter mind numbing. Arizona 15 others. I'M GET FIRST PFIZER VACCINE!!! Hell yeah! Taxpayers pay $5200 bill get $1400 return, steal! billions still sitting accounts last bill haven‚Äôt spent yet businesses. new zealand? barely! near united states.

not one single county united states appropriately locked down, yet still y'all shown government buildings assault rifles protest partial lock downs / restrictions. 

90% could avoided. includes economic damage, children learning remotely, business closures, etc. people would listened actual professionals. government. president. fauci. local politicians. professionals. political figures needed same, needed ensure so, held accountable.

y'all took political bait medical topic, listened public figures law, business, political science degrees instead focusing acutely virologists infectious diseases specialists / modelers, are. still, political bait consumed generous servings daily. Hope so.

I hoping lower-than-expected numbers simply reporting lag, haven‚Äôt seen much ‚Äúcatch up.‚Äù Whatever cdc say, want follow found FDA.gov site expect median follow time 2 months safety data EUA, can‚Äôt find source 6 months full approval.

So everyone says vaccine side effects show weeks ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt exist‚Äù, would FDA require 6 months follow up? replies freaking like Super Bowl superspreader event grand total 54 cases connected it. [never heard exponential really need explain that? overall issue covid summed up, counter intuitively, [this article discussing vaccination article notice extreme attention paying ensure people understand deaths may attributed vaccine though vaccine.

The media gone hoops ensure vaccine safe, point obfuscating science reports otherwise. I'm saying unsafe, however leads conspiracies form unabashedly hide details Florida doctor died getting vaccine. 

On flip side, New York Times hosted full page names died covid. 7th name gunshot victim. Another found twice lethal limit alcohol blood. Yet listed covid published paper. care ensure public knew might attributed covid. 

The circles I'm noticed types stories. led conversations jokes (gallows humor) died ""with covid"" ""caused covid"".

The article linked details people showing emergency rooms significant late diagnosed problems new. types reports circulating since June last year. April last year, pandemic full panic mode everyone staying home keep hospitals safe, [reported hospitals furloughing 

These types comments articles buried media. met derision false accusations, especially coronavirus sub.

To completely clear, I've worn mask. working home possible. friends live across country socially distance online games. However, grandfather sick died last year, prevented seeing due covid measures. wife went doctor discover needed surgery, prevented going back covid measures. Later year, one visit son hospital surgery covid measures. 

So, see, stage game, believe media. care ratings fear porn that. sub fear porn. promote negativity obfuscate news otherwise.

Will vaccine bring end this? Hopefully. However, articles comments like started whole discussion end. trying demonize wish get vaccinated. vaccines system likely. Happens serve US Military. children inoculated polio, measles, mumps, etc. concerns vaccines like polio created many years ago, proven safe, creator forfeited patent betterment all. however problem pharmaceutical companies face liability tons profit pushing one fast. 

At end day, need facts presented fair equitable means need let people make responsible choices. 

Is vaccine microchip? No. purposefully designed cause harm? No. held rigorous evaluation previous vaccines? No. There's also unfortunately going split Black Hispanic people get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (up now) white people got Pfizer Moderna vaccines, overlap race economic disparity related fact Pfizer Moderna vaccines need expense ultracold storage J&amp;J easier expected get weaker, became virulent. That's current reality.  No, still missing key details here. Yes, 4 weeks set endpoint, said likely premature. can't say Pfizer plateaued 4 weeks apply J&amp;J. Pfizer M-rna J&amp;J adenovirus. Adenovirus vector vaccines appear take longer reach peak.

AZ lowering efficacy booster early weird all. makes total sense take account vector resistance. say J&amp;J set endpoint early. Keep mind, numbers using AZ new data. seems like mixing numbers initial AZ data recent, well numbers J&amp;J AZ. One dose AZ reach 70+% 90 days inoculation. 90 days vs 28 days J&amp;J. comparable.
AZ numbers 
2 doses, 6 weeks apart = 55.1%
1 dose 9 weeks = 76%
2 doses 12 weeks apart = 81.3%

If J&amp;J follows similar pattern, means one-shot would likely approach mid 70's two months. they‚Äôre hosting Wrestlemania, super-bowl sized crowd 2 nights. outdoors spaced stadium main concern, it‚Äôs parties around city surrounding event.

Iran said last year American aid scam Americans trying poison Iranians sending fake medicines. way, government able defy America simultaneously appearing protect people (although I'm sure many people fell it). Israel started sending vaccines, see theories spread around. agree outdoor mask mandates pretty much useless? I‚Äôm talking crowded areas, I‚Äôm talking cities college campuses places like that. risk two people passing street, even without masks, almost nonexistent. EU exported 34m doses ‚Äì including 9m pro tiered rollout, tiers idiotic. 

59 year old person going chemo can't get it
17 year old part time grocery store worker can

they two priority medical lists, one two conditions, one one. lists same. three 2nd list, can't get vaccine. 

I mean maybe get vaccine now, irritates someone registers work instacart get one, can't. hypothetically speaking, people stopped ""partying"" wore masks certain percentage rate, followed social distancing reasonable level (you make determinations) would case count graph looked like throughout last year?

i never suggested go maskless lick doorknobs (or microphones, looking gobert), i'm trying figure level infection inevitable level might impacted behavior messaging better adherence ""personal responsibility"" etc. 

i think relevant since people look cost lockdown versus virus typically add one side compare, certain amount virus changable calculus changes, lockdown versus virus lockdown versus 80% virus total lockdown versus virus minus 50,000 cases per day whatever (completely making numbers) We're virtually guaranteed get 20% Americans fully vaccinated month. think we'll hit 30%, we're far March happen. said, think month biggest acceleration initiating vaccination, April biggest acceleration full vaccination.

If United States able expand eligibility administer around 80% distributed doses, we'll hit majority adults initiating vaccination month. would mean majority adults completing point next month. We're looking end this, already states single digit daily death counts that's probably going become much common way things going. day

Did twitter tell this? Dude right everything since beginning. error he's ever made stepping line regarding mask usage year ago. He's incredible! I‚Äôll give shot. 

I don‚Äôt think time see report hospitalizations deaths yet. Yesterday read 42% cases UK variant, recent sharp increase. expected surpass 50% next week. That‚Äôs fast variant moves‚Äîmuch faster wild type. 

Wouldn‚Äôt take time someone catch UK variant, week go hospital, another couple weeks die, knows long reported? 

Maybe see hospitalization death count go month reflect happened last weeks?

EDIT hope: maybe vaccines also prevent expected deaths, won‚Äôt see huge spike! It‚Äôs really mystery. 

Lock downs work. Spread takes place private get togethers masks can‚Äôt enforced. 

Shutting businesses kills economy, stops spread. felt like celebrating getting first dose vaccine.

THIS much. NGL I'm grown ass man cried getting call come get first shot. 
My wife asked crying good news. said really tears joy since pandemic destroyed already fragile mental health. 
 
 instant got call huge weight lifted. finally felt like could relax breathe finally. think made persons day phone well thanked profusely let know didn't
""Make day"", made year, literally. 

 know yet I'm still going diligent, wear mask take general precautions overwhelmed longer fully vaxxed. course, Alaska, need additional equipment store/transport vaccine low temperature faced production constraints. 

Like every fucking manufacturer. 

They‚Äôve delivered millions doses. slow. 3 million. Right now, many states still mostly 65 stage vaccines. demographic lower life expectancy, lower percentage demographic represented eligible group. example 13% white people age 65 vs 9% 8% black people Latinos respectively.

Most articles saying lower numbers bare due hesitancy play part. equity distribution could playing bigger role. notable difference, mind, mandates Florida generally usually extend outdoor areas like elsewhere (unless Miami, one point). inside? Mask wearing nearly 100%, I'm one worry one two maskless people tbh.

I also see people outdoors, alone, wearing masks pretty often. never understand, point. Thank goodness.

How about, ""just fast"", faster better EU didn‚Äôt impose export ban vaccine manufacturers chose manufacturing centre. top head, lets say vial least 1, 6 doses. rite aid went said could open/administer 20 shots day, setting aside fact 20 divisible 6 effectively guarantees wasted doses, even single shot end day leftover 5% waste imho that's still high. apply everywhere, fair scale. example, one wasted shot mass clinic would exceptional, think another way eke every available dose. Another tool box speak. fact. usual, tired messaging Fauci: possibility chance something occurs. message point needs zero excuse get vaccinated available you. there‚Äôs many them. Imagine US 10-30 day. got mine Walmart yesterday. process great. they‚Äôre scheduling much easier state covid WAY infectious flu, get flu get symptoms within 24-48 hours, infectious covid 2 weeks symptoms (if even get symptoms all) Can't wait articles two weeks say actually effective all. really impressive? like sixty people there. Alaska 1/4 population CITY live in. Lol don‚Äôt. Retail pharmacies perpetually understaffed overworked. Scheduled vaccine! excited. hospital nearby surplus opened appointments anyone. Feels unreal. Go Amarillo, open availability, walk in. hope US preparing quickly pivot distributing vaccines countries need

That certainly *is* plan.

To get vaccinated quickly possible maximizing production looking like selfish dicks months help everyone else out. can't ways. either government want oppressive dad ---such China , government like college teacher hardly give fuck whatever do--such US. 

 time would want college teacher type government, except times crisis, want potent, efficient, strong government know get shit done. never say ""oops - wrong - bad."" move next lie next thread. played long game like me. Stay fat getting vaccinated Oklahoma get shape. Yep, totally planned laziness... prove documentation health condition worked essential setting. visibly overweight easier ""prove"" point getting people vaccinated priority #1. everything pre-determined, no. US could've done LOT better many aspects (and countries could - we're ones fumbled this). see realistic path could've taken towards total COVID eradication after, say, March so. virus already country much higher rates first thought. important social distancing masking been, people really think we'd done COVID pesky anti-maskers college kids throwing parties. can't lock forever, especially can't lock older/immunocompromised citizens forever, clear early vaccine path normalcy involve completely giving up. Every single thing that's happened last March March certainly inevitable, there's realistic scenario would maskless licking doorknobs US right people ""irresponsible"" NYT article says results US phase 3 trial expected April, would likely mean EUA May, full approval several months later.

I know people comfortable Novavax far established technology (protein subunit) needs adjuvant work aren‚Äôt necessarily wonderful things put body. I‚Äôd rather take one newer vaccines case caused pandemic prolonged? answer ""nothing"" statement true, predetermined. answer prolonged could changed behavior, please let know since potential changes changed people selfish.

either way, question relevant Officially. Go r/texas they're talking people acted like changed second made announcement think fair, high native population. advantage fully vaccinating state done, need many doses absolutely. PA 16+ risk conditions. able get mine due smoking fianc√©e due reasons. We‚Äôre 30s. measures eliminate covid eliminated flu?  don‚Äôt think NYC gone way. started address problem February. solution retool website open vaccine locations areas. reports widespread vaccine excess new locations, would suggest working. retooling website may effective, doesn‚Äôt really address issues lack access broadband.

So it‚Äôs early expect results, given NYC started initiatives I‚Äôm convinced solutions alone enough break significant barriers (eg languages). course, NYC one city. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt enough, it‚Äôs haven‚Äôt properly allocated. Failures state level don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd power.

Because strict eligibility requirements many shipments directed towards rural parts GA we‚Äôre last among 50 states doses used (65% according NYT). 

Assuming someone eligible lives outside Metro Atlanta area it‚Äôs surprisingly easy get appointment. Grade school level math proves wrong. important far, health officials believe new variant strain causes severe illness reduces effectiveness vaccines, poses health threat merely spreading break further, Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said New York variant accounted approximately 39% cases recent week, 31% week prior; B.1.1.7 strain increased 12% samples, 8% previous means New York variant circulating three times level UK strain necessarily true many previously 'held back' second shots administered people got doses February.

In reality Pfizer/Moderna never delays US (besides freak snowstorm) rather silly keep 32 million doses reserve could push forward faster production issues slow appointments bit. given US 3 big manufacturers nearly 0 likelihood 3 experience delays time. tomorrow Pfizer announces big issues drop production shift new appointments vaccines use reduced Pfizer shipments second shots things stabilize. 

The US need 32 million doses reserve, that's poor management. Sandwich baggie Azithromycin? read local media yesterday UK variant accounts 42% positives Florida. 

So, go well... No, covid outcompeted influenza. MyTurn 

it thing already. people Colorado heading WY TX get shots. People Louisana heading MS. Florida alabama it‚Äôs cool shit Texas rn. End story According NYT MD pretty middle pack % fully Vaccinated, % 1st shot. know pandemic almost they're already clickbaiting next one. Exactly. honest I‚Äôm really sure listening Chris Murray case. basically trying use crystal ball here. go guy predicting deaths hospitalizations different basically amounts trying tell future. go physician ask thinks happen next year. publish article that?

Because feel like got terrible point make. Perfect Peggy goes back gripes people can't park. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt share doses every Canadian inoculated.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs right there. Happened gf first dose (she‚Äôs immune deficient thought something might happen). went away days. I‚Äôd recommend clearing weekend letting body completely rest up. necessarily agree you. think countries responsibility towards people. mean vaccines exported, think makes sense prioritizing vaccinating inhabitants. got back getting J&amp;J shot - feels like 5G reception improved - maybe T-Mobile tower upgrade area? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Focusing single days numbers super useful since reporting nowhere near perfect. could take days person reported receiving vaccine distribution numbers might get reported faster even slower. Look everything whole, CDC says distributed 120 million given 90 million. Seems perfectly reasonable vaccines held make sure run supply decreases give second doses time One death MINNESOTA event ANOTHER STATE. Don‚Äôt intentionally misrepresent data. takes two seconds know citation bullshit, literally says ‚Äúneighboring state‚Äù headline page. also laminate supposed laminate social security cards. I'm hesitant laminate anything official that. would like something durable, also want go hassle getting new vaccine card. despite it'll spin right wing, action legal fits Abbott said. vulnerable people vaccinated, matter? Classy. major cities, Fort Worth doesn't.

They said ""Major cities"". That's lot letters spell ""no"" really anti-science sub. It‚Äôs much ‚Äúwhen get back normal‚Äù speculation sub.  That's awesome. Stay safe. don‚Äôt need name place, traveling last summer northern plains (CO, WY, MT, ND, SD, NE). Seeing masks rarity, even bigger stores. area really saw Denver metro area, even didn‚Äôt go far city see lots people without masks stores. Canada same.. part joining Covax, allowed 20% doses donated.. activated since can't get vaccines anyone else. full vaccination Pfizer shot considered one two weeks second shot? somehow clearly remember 1 week later CDC website says 2 weeks. aren‚Äôt including overweight people yet - least live. know experience. 

I‚Äôm aware sign works- I‚Äôve well helped many others group that‚Äôs helping elderly get appointments they‚Äôre hard time signing up. 

Yes plural - criterion plural criteria. Thanks correction- I‚Äôm multi tasking since you‚Äôre beginning critique spelling, I‚Äôm for, think I‚Äôll stop responding now. Especially since agree you‚Äôre saying (that people abusing criterion) don‚Äôt seem see I‚Äôm saying. Good day. far know, available vaccines fully tested people age 16, can't made available age group yet. Everybody thinks full shit, live tiny metro area surrounded hick towns everything 99 percent normal here. businesses operating full capacity mask requirements. thing larger chain stores ""six feet stickers"" floor. Nobody follows them. recent videos attacks people Asian descent Bay Area, including one Nepali Uber driver, makes feel lucky live rural Tennessee. reservation vaccinating four surrounding counties. Yeah. point enough demand among 35-50 year olds keep throughout maxed out, make sense open 20-35 year olds yet point. thought clear. hasa pretty good breakdown it. Regarding UK probably classic export ban condition contract manufacturers first x million doses produced UK go UK. case, exports UK EU, way around.

Now saying UK think EU naive negotiate similar contract, reproaching EU protectionism / vaccine nationalism hypocritical. Doses aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsent‚Äù UK. produced *in* UK, using plants paid UK government. exchange funding, contract Astra Zeneca stipulates first 100 million doses must set aside UK residents. Hot take. 

Explain universe makes sense hardest hit country world, highest number infections, highest number deaths... begin exporting vaccines enough stem tide? increase 0.25% 0.41% among people diagnosed community testing opposed hospital (so lower risk cohort, hence relatively low IFR). headline literally uses word ‚Äútreatment‚Äù implies use patients already disease. Don‚Äôt see misleading all, perhaps use phrase ‚Äúhospitalized patients‚Äù would slightly better actually said. sick enough put hospital, treatment much use - already fallen cliff.

I find interesting comments article difficult quickly organize clinical trials due (dis)organization health care system. appear little reduction antibodies handle well. Let's forget Fauci bungled AIDS epidemic badly millions died needlessly. sudden he's untouchable? Pssssh Covid last March got J&amp;J vaccine. Since previously Covid, hit BAD (103 fever even ton ibuprofen, horrific chills, couldn‚Äôt pee, accelerated heart beat, etc), legit worse Covid.... assume means wouldn‚Äôt need booster shot, since presumably body enough antibodies?

I almost go ER, really don‚Äôt want take another dose. doubt ever over. :( totally missing point makes seem like slow adult. Same, tennessee too. EC signed deal first opportunity countless millions now.

Also ""crappy"" üòÇ real world data shows AZ better preventing hospitalisations Pfizer. there's decent broadband Anchorage. Rural Alaska worse connectivity third world countries. even read wrote? gave DATA shows benefits longer intervals. Like said AstraZeneca EFFECTIVE longer intervals. Read wrote fucking idiot Didn‚Äôt cdc say week fully vaccinated people congregate groups without masks? Agreed.  live east tennessee, exactly one county mask mandate. None others mask mandates, restaurants businesses open full capacity.

A lot businesses around signage actively discouraging masks, rest signs all. mine tucked passport. disaster, may/june every adult willing vaccinated already served.

I mind getting sniffles days. Yup, timelines Canada already moved ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù case 1st dose everyone June 20th (May 18th provinces), 2nd dose vaccinations begin that. Two weeks May ask doubt. someone help me. AstraZeneca said vaccine ~60% effective spaced 4 weeks apart, ~80% effective spaced 12 weeks apart. Yet ~72% effective 90 days single dose according pre-published results. add up? question is, single dose effective 72% 90 days, second dose drastically drop efficacy much? India's phase 3 tests, dropped around ~50%.

The problem till apart studies, government mandated gap 12 weeks doses. I'm scared ask parents wait greater time.

In end, want safe hospitalization. hope even 2 doses spaced 1 month apart Congratulations! Yes, work favor!

In India's phase 3 tests, dropped around ~50%. oh yeah. twitter posts well (from IG) trying justify whole thing.

Oh, that's good thinking. healthcare, I'm first phases.

Oh, see. important get vaccinated then. really able breathe easily (a saying Serbian, know English lol, means worry less). 

Oh, know guys got choose shot too. Serbia get choose one want. signed Pfizer Sputnik V, hoping get vaccinated next week so. remotely accurate. Federal retail program going much worse lot state programs. saw thing states signed long term healthcare local pharmacies state programs verse federal retail programs. local state programs much quicker programs run feds private businesses like cvs, rite aid, etc. private market can‚Äôt hire tons people program barely makes profit even run loss gonna largely temporary. read article yesterday random doctor (I wish remembered name) saying vaccines give virus needs mutate bypass vaccine protection people getting vaccines bad idea. 


There ALWAYS people insist turning good situation bad one even illogical arguments. you‚Äôre less likely die. doesn‚Äôt make reward. I'm major metropolitan area CVS Walgreens still vaccine. dozens upon dozens locations city could distributing aren't. Checking online, looks like third country still regular retail pharmacies distributing.

How planned still fixed beyond understanding. clearly logistics distribution problem. Appointments still booked within minutes. stores still enforce them. least around DFW mean... There's like 10 people penguin living Alaska. enough vaccines everyone Yeah normally opinion would public health standpoint instead moralizing it, we've known *year* obese people need lose weight much, much likely complications. They've whole, freaking year lose weight. That's I'm angry about. Good them! Pandemic over. Time move life. Get folks back work. Get sanity back. EU's actions factor all. even necessarily arguing UK export vaccines EU. 

But UK exporting countries? Even though EU botched planning vaccine production, whatever arguing, they're *still* exporting vaccines Canada. 

The UK better job vaccine production. vaccines per person, could export least Canada. don't. know why? they're following US UK-First strategy made vaccine exports impossible. I‚Äôm sure makes said incorrect. ever reason lower percentage black people Latinos younger, still lower number eligible people going age. showing disparity people often look state‚Äôs overall demographic assuming hold true regardless age isn‚Äôt case. state 20% Hispanic 7% current 65+ phase vaccinated thus far Hispanic, hesitancy factors investigated? 

It‚Äôs seems easier say it‚Äôs cultural admit structural barriers contribute lower vaccination numbers. 81 year old parents got second shots Ohio already weeks ago. Can't wait get mine!  Right... higher price won‚Äôt applied doses already order, countries afford buy vaccines already ordered two, three four times many doses populations need. give CVS charge like $10. doses gone time. Yeah media keeping shut put false front covid dying we'll going Blink 182 concerts maskless summer. actuality, making comeback lol 
/s  15 year olds got first Moderna shot 10 days ago. Questions!

1) data protection offered one Moderna shot? Esp. 14 days?

I *am* going get second shot, I'm curious whether there's evidence protection get it.

2) concerned reaction shot?

Related question 2: I've taking ivermectin weekly since November, including hours vaccinated (I took company several dozen people vaccination site, decent distancing *most* time noticeable ventilation).

3) Would serologic test reveal whether vaccine effect? so, long wait trying get serological test?

Thanks MUCH response(s)! think fact they're blatantly lying vaccine pandemic trajectory (the EU rollout slow, slow) worse actual policy itself. know Florida largest death toll country. time admit wrong keep rambling like loon, call, know proper response. ü§º Seems like hundred morons protesting 5g cant go soccer games something. Probably people ""worked"" home year, spent much time obscure internet fourms got bored. ignore üòÖ Nah Don‚Äôt mean downer, I‚Äôm super worried getting second dose Pfizer

I received first dose Pfizer vaccine last Saturday felt fine evening next night started heart palpitations heart also racing. day body felt really worn small instances fuzzy feeling left side face. 

I‚Äôm worried know first dose supposed easy one whereas second one rougher body, I‚Äôm concerned effects heart. I‚Äôm trying dissuade people getting vaccine, expressing experience far. anyone else experienced similar side effects first dose? received second one, yet? suspect thats Dollar General/Target/CVS announcements coming today - counties states realized they're maxing administration starting collect doses can't give fast needed. state havent even gotten normal people yet. alaska getting vaccine per capita ahead everyone else absolutely dont need vaccine - 30-39 - (3,573,541)
Deaths - 30-39 - (4,331)

0.12%

[Not giving hard time--just made laugh!] Finally someone reports obvious that's going past weeks lol /s guess semantics, something that's 2-3 times infectious something else, would consider way infectious. Lol year ago. He's incredible! right everything. Outcompeted? serious?? answer, new flu spread fast COVID??? know deep competitive move catch Walmart. Vaccines getting involved business schemes good. /s think also worth mentioning Austria (like Europe) similar, higher, cases per capita compared US since October, currently way behind vaccine rollout. like he's super scared virus himself.

Israel's experience looks like takes 2 weeks second dose develop full immunity NY lowered 60 today. businesses can't legally stop maskless person entering /s 12 last year, think we're 9 looked. case rate dropped 77% last 90 days.

Australia would like 250,000 vaccines back case. couple months more, we‚Äôll nice summer winter lockdown. üç™ EU Commission informed total 37 export inquiries made January 30 February 10, 2021. approved. Exports gone 21 countries - including US, UK, China, Japan, Canada Australia.

so much live Texas signed local county‚Äôs vaccine waitlist (Collin County). certain point list transferred organization called Curative Medical Association last week given code allows schedule appointment. Collin County also says plan finishing vaccinations waitlist end week. 

Thing is, I‚Äôm 25 underlying health conditions, meaning don‚Äôt belong either groups/phases currently getting vaccinated. still try schedule appointment? can‚Äôt imagine every person list qualified either (there 270,000 people signed up). Plot twist: actually cough common cold/s level bureaucracy needed screen eligible people tiered system pretty high

Which know people support actually believe small government that, want punish people ""deserve"" help. Guilty. Fauci says wear mask gathered unvaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going couple people house. yeah, totally guilty putting aspects life ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù prescriptive extreme risk avoidance. know Ohio prepping bunch big vaccination centers open next week. age gets lowered 50 thursday and, assumption next week it'll drop centers opened. hard get appointment, least columbus. colder states 6 inches snow inconvenience, emergency. 

When winter storm hit US last month, business usual north warmer states focus dying. hell gonna see lower age limits? maybe offer Canadian seniors vaccine. agree sentiment issue obese folks catch COVID likely need intubated severe case, lead hospitals overflowing causing repeat 2020. need avoid people pre existing conditions vaccinated first. 3 5 voters located New York, Maryland, azul states, etc. 1 100 rojo states Texas, California, Tennessee, Florida, etc. /s COVID bad ad media portrays?

Not even close bad media people insane, bunch going die? care? keep seeing huge gatherings like this, mask mandates, things fully open entire time.

They care minimal level risk getting sick living lives. They're Toronto lockdown 5 months now. literally acting opposite ways, genuinely curious like Florida?

Free. Life normal mask wearing places. There's better place planet right now. fewer Texans 14-21 days Sorry - Novavax. 

Oxford viral vector vaccine right? also quite bit newer protein subunit vaccines. lot people say ‚Äúthe research started long time ago‚Äù that‚Äôs true comparison protein subunit vaccines they‚Äôve way fewer arms No, *you* stay home cases start rise. vaccination well way, there‚Äôs reason continue lockdowns. covid outcompeted flu. like there's new flu strain old ones often disappear never seen again. Cool. Thanks additional explanation. Agreed points B well. Hiring someone UN-count deaths ALRRADY certified trickle remaining ones back numbers often month reported state long way go allow clueless internet pundits tout fake numbers.

‚ÄúEverything‚Äù includes mortality rates, mental health issues, vaccine development, etc. lump together say ‚Äúso saying **everything** predetermined‚Äù using strawman. case caused pandemic prolonged?

Masks social distancing specifically put place *to prolong pandemic*, flattening curve does. articles ‚Äúyeah make things take longer, hospitals won‚Äôt get overwhelmed‚Äù, don‚Äôt remember that? include J&amp;J right? appropriately locks entire regions single case detected.

Why want businesses fail, people lose jobs, children fall behind development, substance domestic abuse incidents explode coronavirus? Well.... get shot come back used 76/second number corresponds 12 hours per day.

a. reasonable/expected, given literally highest priority presently.

b. Even long, noted, excluding huge swath vaccination sites could plausibly even double throughput.

In words, matter slice it, numbers well within realm possibility. literally saw article today clinic Pasadena cancelled appointments Thursday cause discovered group people eligible signed appointments...

So they'd rather 0 vaccinations ""bad apples"" give people damn shot?? 

It's getting bit absurd point, matter weeks tiers gonna obsolete guy refused shave beard makes FFP2 masks pointless responsible denying elderly access AZ. They're younger too, since states going age going see higher percentage white people get vaccine.

I'm wondering too. Perhaps bias talking, seems like Texas decent amount positive news past couple decades company's relocating economy booming. possible Texas target negative news portrayed positively lately?

I live Texas, perhaps 'positive' news I'm talking exactly case I'm speaking biased point view..lol. COVID estimated 2-3x infectious flu looking R0. think practically flu deaths US past winter, past year thousands???

If you‚Äôre type person things every little thing going cause surge, supposed educated think everyone educating idiot? Doesnt really work way though. Distributing vaccine federal level way vaccination site isnt simple. take many variables account cant say ""hey let's switch things up"".

I'd argue since ability ""have fun"" pursue happiness without gathering large groups, unalienable right infringed, especially context global pandemic. IMHO, right go church (which also heavily restricted, begrudgingly disagree this) right protest much stronger.

All said, I'm rando internet, constitutional scholar.  mean 2m doses administered far today (with still half day remaining)? last 24 hours? guess good question whether administration capacity issue (not enough openings provided) administration filling issue (lots unused openings)? don‚Äôt know answer, could depending area well. think somewhat predictable would lag dramatic manufacturing acceleration proportional administration acceleration. expect go hand hand, even would great, want see local governments even Biden's administration making consequential long term steps decrease gap.

No, I'm strawmanning you. said booster lowering efficacy make sense vector immunity. one quoted section said make sense.

Yes, everything assumption data. seem misreading I'm saying. Let specific can

1. IMO, J&amp;J tested efficacy prematurely. actually saw efficacy variants increase time phase 3 results FDA approval. even since then, we've already seen increase efficacy time given.

2. Oxford vax losing efficacy given booster prematurely make sense, given effect vector resistance. Sputnik V uses 2 different adenoviruses, circumvent this. also hopefully mean 2 dose trial J&amp;J shows good increase. it'll booster, they're giving first shot 8 weeks instead 4. question bill, I‚Äôm hoping someone answer it. people impression pay back 1400 stimulus payment? friend tell doesn‚Äôt want anyone get doesn‚Äôt want pay it. understand 1.9 trillion dollars added deficit, 1400 payments entirety bill.

Can someone please help understand offensive that? plastic surgeon's assistant, so... Flu transmissible mostly symptomatic (asymptomatic transmission 1/3 total flu transmission cases). personal experience flu, fact experience flu symptoms pretty reliably, even vaccinated. did, fact, attend super-spreader events, pre-COVID, concerts, music festivals, airplane trips, good sense experiencing flu symptoms. 

No, people disease vectors, disease vectors contagious disease about. Thus, common courtesy stay home contagious. least wear masks block transmission, prior pandemic, every flu season.

Well wrong. literally post - kind protection get one dose. impression, can't help absolutely stand said. think laid pretty clearly. You're, obviously, free disagree. Sounds good, cure certain period time?  used EU member states public funding develop kickstart vaccine production EU.
 
When reality countries receiving vaccine started funding development whilst EU haggling price.  I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs future ready idea mask COVID shield see people mentality. 

Here‚Äôs way see it...

You got vaccine...ditch mask. 

You didn‚Äôt get vaccine covid...use discretion. 

You didn‚Äôt get Covid vaccine got vaccine COLD symptoms...wear mask. 

It‚Äôs truly fucking simple. People social distancing, washing hands, wearing masks 1900-2019 cold symptom yet one did. 

Moral story: people idiots need global event heed common sense.   mistaking definition mentally incompetent tried, mentally ill.

The court specific legal definition takes mentally incompetent, high threshold qualify.

That completly different mentally ill, many criminals are. No, fine Americans getting vaccinated.

It'll work out. Fight antivax dolts, let spread misinformation. call 5 ask there‚Äôs list call 5 ask directly unused vaccines? Bold assume US would ""just send"" vaccines elsewhere. Love optimism. Same.

Funny, lets deduce point clearly incapable yourself. 


Your first point states situation clearly good hospitalized. point mute small fall hospitalize elderly person major sign something super serious.  


Your follow comment states vaccine stop old people collapsing comments suggest think tested covid administrated hospital. proof entire argument based title actually read article diagnosed covid 6 days collapse know read first paragraph article.  


It never states cause collapse comment opinion based anything factual. could covid related, might been. know stated. idea vaccine stopped speculation based nothing. second point also mute.  


The facts hospitalized since hospital shown signs minor symptoms positive test nothing appearing life threatening.  


Have nice day. 


FYI: resorting insults makes position look weak. worth pointing part Pfizer vaccine production line EU depends component UK. freely allows delivered Belgium.

This EU backs every time UK calls EU also never stop delivery Pfizer delivered think everyone America vaccinated? worried constantly anti-vax population country. putting ""done"" quotes indeed meant imply get protection would get 2 doses mRNA vaccines.

My point goes implies HERE, statement must controversial. sincerily hope agree.

You've made pretty clear talking discussed places science discussed. railing media saying thread. Yeah unless comparison numbers wild type prior new treatment systems, plus it‚Äôs infectious.  I'm beginning notice subreddit seems optimistic general public byproduct better-informed general public.

If get news fear-mongering news media, power-hungry politicians, pessimistic friends, never know good things actually going. people aware actual numbers state, vaccination projections, vaccine effectiveness, etc. export ban comes region L'Europe priority allocation citizens. I'm certain people totally following mask mandate minute simultaneously removed them, like true TX law-abiding citizens, right? GTFO. People stopped wearing soon word went would happening. vaccines sent UK. first 100 million built specific plants UK exclusive everything else exported freely. sure that‚Äôs settled science yet burn warmth? get 3  click button prompt want see cases vaccinations. directly bring state health department dashboard subject. Pretty simple paperwork got got Pfizer said 1-2 weeks Yea trial participants knowledge vaccine worked knew got placebo anyways. Oh no, anyway I‚Äôm goose sausage lunch. It‚Äôs pretty killer. elaborate? doubt it, read anything specific Abbott Covid vaccine distribution, aside dumbass move lifting mask mandate business restrictions. Idaho close. opened 18 64-year-olds kind pre-existing condition, smoking high blood pressure included. essential workers elderly opportunity, demand low. Idaho Republican low population like Alaska, makes sense. use smaller number groups ease administration make simpler population understand. would optimal sort entire population risk go person person take account. buckets better fewer buckets, number buckets gets unwieldy.

The reason doling group group first place people higher risk others, want get vaccines people higher risk people lower risk. Vaccine doses scarce, can't make free want protect people higher risk quickly possible.

As last paragraph, risk death many times higher 35-50 year olds 20-35 year olds.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

Thanks! No, EU blocking Pfizer delivering promised, fact offered another 4 million EU. EU block Pfizer getting every single dose ordered? Thank you! Avoid topic political comments. us basically manufacturing j&amp;j Merk. 

I assure EU won‚Äôt getting doses us sure enough themselves. Mask mandates (outside medical facilities, course) one singular purpose, keep hospitals overwhelmed.

The threat hospitals diminishing weeks due vaccinations. stand corrected. 200 million catch time, way 330 million Americans catch virus last year even though vaccines little natural immunity.

Also, Pfizer/Moderna vaccines effective SA variant, they're effective relative strains. That's important difference, studies done figure exactly much effectiveness diminished strain. mention, J&amp;J still seems work it, Moderna working boosters allow variants. 

There still every reason believe active pandemic behind us sooner rather later, SA variant not. Yeah it‚Äôs common courtesy point. Better extra enough. goes well, give spare doses countries. . may get enough vaccines point theory system getting shots arms mess . i'd bet 2nd one closer right actual right answer exponential, whatever growth rate goes 0-50% 14 days

""This isnt designed pay bills, designed help keep food table"" (That's quote you)

Then say worries keeping food table. Sooooo.....why getting stimulus check? That's everyone's point find empathy one side. (Yes know sounds radical empathy someone high salary)

We can't claim stimulus keep food table large percentage people getting demonstrably use savings/frivolous purchases. stuff fine drive economy forward midst pandemic shit over.

There essentially zero risks vaccines, mild flu-like symptoms (which means working intended) short period time. China still trying push narrative virus imported Wuhan. ‚Äúkicks in‚Äù makes garbage.

‚ÄúVaccine doesn‚Äôt reach peak effectiveness weeks second shot‚Äù would accurate still stupidly sensationalized.

How ‚ÄúWhy still need masks - Vaccine protects partially days, fully 2 weeks 2nd jab‚Äù? suspect right wing social contacts view Bolsonaro hero, support view coronavirus nothing little flu. Indigenous populations Brazil getting decimated virus, helps Bolsonaro desire totally rape Amazon. Good guys, then. lot developed countries (most them, fact) well. won't. Stores can't even really enforce mask mandates(Too many people often dangerous). Encouraging people cannot policed dangerous. labradoodle thinks so.

Cover face penises, y'all! would think Harley Davidson company would oppose since (almost) last remaining customers. GA one worst far percentage doses used that‚Äôs one top indicators success. People argue day long priority end shots need arms. GA absolutely failing compared states. People desperate get vaccine can‚Äôt make appts GA poor job. They‚Äôve since last July vaccines tested start coming distribution plan clearly failing. People rightly furious Kemp Well England data showed Pfizer 57-61% efficacious preventing infection 1 dose, biggest sample size. actually better 1 dose according trial, par(ish) 1 dose AZ. People ignore protest bad rules time. many unenforceable laws ""Full vaccine effect"" implies existence partial vaccine effect. open vial know 10 arms put in. That's appointments, that's calls useless. Damn wish lived ;-; Hmmm here.
Just lockdown hospital cases fall, (we did) ICU (we did), RT value goes (it has), variants gone. Apparently. keep changing reason keep us lockdown. fair shit ton old people here... politician delivering promised? Inconceivable! Exactly. age patient facing healthcare workers. Otherwise, get mess states trying work equity issue opposite side (the virus) care.

To get point, lawyers many states considered essential. guess go jails meet prisoners. lawyer never jail meet client - ever (now bailing friends another story). worked home 80% time COVID. Zoom, phones, etc. 50 okay shape (could stand lose pounds like lawyers). chances dying COVID minimal - like less dying car accident. reason point jump line place 72 year old woman (like mom still trying get vaccinated). Early pandemic doctors got tv said don‚Äôt work , people tell wear two. whole messaging fucked since beginning. 

My point is, still wear masks crazy obsession everything mask nothing red herring . know work it‚Äôs one piece much larger puzzle. Scientists acknowledged private gatherings long propelled problem. deliver suppose. still think ""hey, AZ failed us worried deliveries around world we're going increase manufacturing capacity"". suppose adds question, fuck before? 

All all, wonder, before? feels like Western countries placed eggs baskets tried cheap. worried wasted capacity speedy rollout. Hindsight wonderful thing though. It'll connect 5G signal. republicans make sense. 
abortion - pro life.
yet
covid - anti life didn‚Äôt say that. fact, they‚Äôre worth lot standard.

In fact though, proposal study would cost million per life saved. tout cheap.

But million dollar per life saved, better ways spend amount save way 15,700 lives. UK 2 serious months lockdown....... opposed Canada's plan give everyone one shot first, Israel really doubled trying fully vaccinate people. Therefore, even though Israel 98.5 doses vaccine per 100 people, ""only"" 55% people least one shot.  positivity rate equal US' right- 18% getting one shot. Also, I'm guessing demographic making plans spring break Cancun sort care US Embassy say. remember keep normal precautions least two weeks (and ideally week second dose) starting meet vaccinated people, etc. - takes long really start working, according data. one said healthy, life death diseases have. locked house though, left since March 2020 to. spread likelihood infection close zero. 

Meanwhile, classroom sick kids day long. could easily infect fifteen kids parents going school get symptoms. 

If one dose, give overweight thirty year old leave house give someone reach community? 

And say work supermarket restaurant? reach increases exponentially. I'd give person working restaurant. far good. believe write news vaccines use means pandemic still raging definition, it‚Äôs good use flair

Do see flaw thinking? Austin choosing require mask good news because, like vaccine, going help stop pandemic Looks like feds allocate 9M Pfizer doses next week, slightly week. thought Pfizer aiming something like 13M week mid-March? misremembering? Yup, ""September 11th Security Fee: 11.20 USD"" $200 flight. bottleneck supply, prioritizing save lives makes sense. First come first serve would make sense bottleneck end-point delivery. anyone else feel like covid situation eroded trust doctors take mental health seriously? know it‚Äôs rational generalize, I‚Äôm thinking particular encounter physician recently rubbed wrong way.

So UK thinks ahead likely outcome, pays private company setup vaccine production facilities gets writing first 100m go facilities goes UK. UK stopped pharma companies setting production facilities UK, export bans made (we even ship components Pfizers vaccine EU) getting contractually obligated us private company.

The EU hand set vaccine hub would exporting globally, failed look citizens. Thats see Italy blocking exports vaccines countries paid for.

Contractually UK right, morally UK one hardest hit countries Europe using Italy argument puts us right well. Also actually using vaccines produced instead storing warehouse petty bureaucracy (Germany). yeah EU one fronts, shit flinging find scapegoat poor performance EU vaccine commission. UK makes nice target Brexit hence amount statements coming EU government. Yeah fine, think end becoming unfair pressure frequently piled black role models basically never put onto white ones. think part agreement, much important point he's public figure tens millions people look him, using platform responsible way right now.  see lot people claiming UK blocking exports. actually seen anything support this, could explain more?  I'm really referencing deaths. High risk people higher risk complications think players would want ASAP. precautions stop do. Although suspect vast majority players already covid now. Also, maybe controversial, I'm okay getting early. 19 year olds driving uber eats getting it. Id argue traveling different cities NBA players expose more, end day 300 players, probably throw doses that. Pfizer AZ administered one dose regimen UK efficacy preventing severe disease 86% Pfizer (identical JnJ) 94% AZ. Even metric JnJ superior. good best, inferior worst.

So knew thousands would die policies Trump administration, decided stay let muted rather resign shout truth rooftops? brave him, clearly person trusted. didn‚Äôt wear masks instead spending billions $ researching developing flu shots?

Because big Pharma likes profits. couple thousand people go hang front Abbott's house like month? agree lifting up, places I, rarely, frequent Houston keeping theirs.

That‚Äôs really talking say informed consent. Information provided individuals weigh pros cons- make educated decision bodies. 
Personally faith Johnson Johnson old school vaccine think everyone high risk absolutely get it. think anyone knows fact C19 antibodies getting vaccine.

People wore everyone else does/did. 20,000 494,000 deaths US. 50 group makes 4% total US deaths, 40-49 group makes 14,000 20,000. still likely live, even high risk. I‚Äôd say totally inhumane. people charge Texas leave people fend side put everyone cage ‚Äúfor good.‚Äù USA genuine export ban.
UK contract ensuring first 100m doses brand new production sites built less year. 
EU customer, one without exclusivity priority, late game. leaving lot nuance.

I think am. talking efficacy preventing disease. Obviously. Nothing wrong that. never claimed alluded less.efficscious preventing severe disease. JnJ 85% efficacy preventing severe disease, also lower compared 4 vaccines mentioned. withing CI? Sure. Comparisons still drawn. fine, let's say *are* equally efficacious preventing severe disease. 

Everything said stands. misleading absolutely way. gloss anything. Everything said factual fair complete. right now, JnJ administered single dose vaccine. trials 2 dose vaccine ongoing absolutely guarantee outcome whether people would.be getting second shot. Even do, time soon.

Also, explained another comment outcome *actually* likely OPINION ESTIMATION, based data viral vector vaccines. short - minimal additional protection. point here, ofc. ‚ÄòShe sue lash technician‚Äô ü§£ Looks legit, go CDC website browser instead clicking link.

I suspect misunderstood point. so, mea culpa. Russia SA aren‚Äôt league America - America much less sceptical article dispute anything. specific saying **at least** 86 cases Minnesota 5 days rally admit likely undercount voluntary nature findings report subject least three limitations. First, despite in-depth epidemiologic investigation, findings represent underestimate motorcycle rally‚Äôs impact Minnesota capture impact within South Dakota states. Case interviews voluntary, patients could choose respond certain questions. Ten patients reported close contacts refused disclose additional details regarding contacts. Therefore, possible identify contacts patients attended rally. Second, attendees contacts might tested SARS-CoV-2. Two rally attendees indicated contacts COVID-19‚Äìlike symptoms plan tested. such, findings underrepresent number cases, close contacts, secondary tertiary cases. Finally, 52 specimens received MDH Public Health Laboratory many testing laboratories retain store specimens long-term. Among specimens, 38 successfully sequenced. lack whole genome sequencing data cases hindered establishment complete genetic relatedness epidemiologic investigation. count cases? That‚Äôs trick! Unexpected deaths? Heart attack, aneurism- don‚Äôt even test Covid, and, like magic, Covid deaths! Sure, unexplained rise mortality rate- that‚Äôs coincidence... Gonna LIT. Seattle metro population like 4 million people, city limits pretty small. Good see much rational sub gotten. remember year ago beginning whole sub littered fear-mongerers. Honestly shocking see comment saying non-sense keep wearing mask vaccination 30 upvotes. 30 million vaccinations per month, 60 million. 2 million doses per day vaccines require 2 doses halve total population vaccinated fully. It‚Äôs already close pre-pandemic normal much south midwest.

Rest country 2-4 months away. Maybe little longer California Newsom awful. Seriously? Pfizer forced deliver US make point US Pfizer's biggest cash-cow far? 

What expect say here? That's literally whole point. photographed mine. think lower efficacies symptomatic covid higher efficacy hospitalization death? Maybe? Come on, guy dead, leave alone. suffered long hard. Ah okay, article found mentioned obesity. Yeah, stupid.

I see yesterday Georgia complete bottom pile first doses. Checking now, looks like 49th place (Alabama) vaccinated 15% people per capita. Bottom states % supply used well issue people taking available appointments deeper logistical issue? country Europe gonna take 7-15 months get population vaccinated. way it‚Äôs gonna take long.

But UK export crucial lipids needed Pfizer vaccine EU.

I‚Äôm sorry, things cannot possible. isn‚Äôt like don‚Äôt science. know lockdowns slow spread low percentage, explains first point true. Nothing anywhere particularly reputable, unfortunately. suppose anecdotal anything sound angry.  I'm regular BMI non-smoking stay home mom remote school kids past year I'm planning getting last available shot ever make anything pleasant surprise. one blame garbage tier government leaders state. still reserving 2nd doses unfortunately afaik Problem even got vaccine tomorrow still lot people need get it. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm really rushing vaccine there‚Äôll enough us sooner later. Stop trolling, Mr. Downvoted. Thanks! That's expected anytime dealing rural dispersed population. matter schedule it, going doses administered within hour requirement. 2-3 doses thrown away last batches opened becomes much higher location giving 20 doses day compared one 500. unlikely point would unreasonable expect someone stay home two weeks. There‚Äôs reason anymore since supply supposed cranking Good  Actually, injected substance tanning pills impossible cuprite (c.f. *canthaxanthin).* lot private businesses schools too. Careful Austin, you‚Äôre starting make sense. can't mass text everyone new tier opens up? many people aware eligible while. white Texan, man, hear they‚Äôre saying aren‚Äôt around. sayin‚Äô. Folks city generally less racist got edge town gets rural get shittier shittier open ... long they‚Äôre like company. know it‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt care much. 

Glad everyone treating well though. you‚Äôre city, it‚Äôs almost certainly earnest. vaccinated roughly 80% adult population"" target austin cuz occasionally inconveniences personally. bit 10% population work vaccine hesitancy. Vaccines available people afraid get them, three sons included. Availability shots arms. Work educating pwople. rescinding order ‚â† order. seems like cases still dropping off? really wish get passed ""prediction"" method news reporting deal real information point. sure brother. trying spread word vets know check locally VA hospitals. VA hasn‚Äôt exactly done great job putting word out. Probably something either. one hand, find another restaurant...

On hand, putting mask go inside, immediately take eat...

Pure security theatre. anyone support this? sure can‚Äôt think modern historical events in, say, Minnesota might important modern era race relations. point lot people glass houses like throwing stones towards south. may tolerance death whatever Brazil won‚Äôt work. They‚Äôll straddled generation workers lung problems. It‚Äôs ticking time bomb. surprised. Felt like almost every independently owned business, good amount corporations gonna enforce mask rule anyways. Lucky Texan Austin. It‚Äôs bad analogy. 

Lockdowns America never going work. draconian enforcement fully functional lockdown illegal here. No, not. Idiot. read anything vaccines? catch chances high you‚Äôll think cold. congrats yo Celiac. involves activation lamina propria helper cells, overaccumulation type cells called intraepithelial lymphocytes, kill cells. saying seatbelt use federally mandated drivers passengers. many people stupid take care prevent needless tragedy death.

Sometimes actually need 'Nanny State', adults insist deliberately acting like irresponsible children. Except local issue respects city borders. localized rules best intended for.

Pfizer booked seem fill fast J&amp;J. course locations different cities within county could preference J&amp;J location, J&amp;J vaccine. point - area I'm hearing seeing people showing strong preference one vaccine another. thankfully!!  course things affect virus transmission. reality many people don‚Äôt follow rules, regardless whether Government adopts regulations. there‚Äôs point Government enacting measures cause real harm (shutdowns) working class people zero evidence measures significant effect virus transmission. Let summarize virtual learning you

1. It‚Äôs 2 2.5 hours day places

2. commuting time costs

3. disruptive students deal 

4. There‚Äôs probably much grade either. lot students aren‚Äôt work, lot work graded computer.


I lol people think teachers don‚Äôt love virtual learning. say need mask visiting *vaccinated* people home? yea, majority risk comes kids getting spreading vulnerable family family vaccinated, risk ultimately extremely low. however, parents protective kids even tho corona isnt likely gonna anything child, protective parents still want protect I‚Äôll rephrase question: state frontline essential workers don‚Äôt qualify vaccine? Thanks, Dad. you‚Äôve got places like GA holding things back. They‚Äôre used 65% doses Kemp acts like they‚Äôre great people peeing pool, solution allow everyone decide want pee there? saying? seems answer much stricter enforcement mask wearing better designations actually ""essential"". Luckily there's vaccine hopefully matter much hopefully long term effects got neither unforseeable bad. let anyone lie you. GOP leadership Texas beyond joke. Fuck every one them. Yawn know, competent leadership actually wants vaccinate people. doctors i've condescending everything.  cdc started releasing j &amp; j numbers far, country, 3 million doses delivered 300,000 jabs delivered far spent life there, thought pretty cool till went almost city west coast east coast. Local control double-edged sword lefties love masks. Theyre heaven. Texan, fine. I've actually faced racism outside Texas - people actually nice. think lot old stereotypes racist Texans seemed stick, even rural areas, people lot welcoming kind interactions you. think much different states even political beliefs. us bigger cities generally tend vote blue smaller towns tend vote red thing happens states regardless whether end red blue. Thing is, gentrification huge issue makes hard growing number blue voters make huge impact deserve make given voting rights. Short answer: technically still allow it, none 100 percent. Chances happening vaccines much lower vaccinated. likely comparative studies particular aspect while, small percentage occuring takes longer get kind data. moved Alaska Texas couple months ago Thanks input doc nature logistics. delivering 100 vaccines town 100 people easy, huge states countries youre gonna run lot different logistical issues Well. play devils advocate. made opposite decision, we‚Äôd calling unqualified. *I guess he‚Äôd rather Colorado*

‚Äî John Denver ive read, march 15 next eligibility tier set open up, tier includes 16-65s serious health conditions lynchings took place happened South. big reason end Civil War. black given freedom, many people felt freed blacks getting away much freedom felt needed controlled. Mississippi highest lynchings 1882-1968 581. Georgia second 531, Texas third 493. 79% lynching happened South. think think there‚Äôs lag doses labeled distributed doses actually arriving administration site. Doses considered distributed shipped state. still need arrive state, allocated vaccination site, sent site appts made administered. could easily take week. absolutely much vaccinations though government supposed work local levels

You say agree outcome. city California wanted get rid mask mandates business restrictions call resignation. Dude china bolted people apartments. 

Now that‚Äôs serious lockdown. I'm sure know already, know long immunity lasts infection vaccines. Studies put immunity infection long 8 months - may longer that's far know right now.

If partner covid fairly recently, likely got time issue. hopefully less difficult get vaccine (in terms searching appointments) people gotten it, may help come around. 

Best luck both. hope end getting it. mean, doubt? Partly forced integration south. north stayed largely segregated still are. fiscal year ends September. company growing revenue (55B, 59B, 69B) dropped 65B 2020, almost half year 65B pre-pandemic, impact pandemic much apparent 2021 fiscal reporting.  Income went 11B 2019 -2.8B 2020, though bigger impact pandemic 2021 reporting.

It's apples apples either.

Disney closed acquisition Fox May 2019. Obviously $71 billion deal going increase top line revenue. mathematical model crap open access journal lmao. Stop posting fake news! choice involves endangering people‚Äôs health, yes. think build small surplus covid within last 90 days Children able get vaccine they're able get dont run issue like adults are. otherwise, yes believe USA one biggest helpers world they're finished people. Exactly. hospitalized, bombarded antibiotics. secondary infection actually screwed covid... Today (9 months later) sort tests worried medicines screwed kidneys liver. sucks perhaps saved life back Making live virus therapy billions instead millions new manufacturing problem. Every two dose series reaches peak efficacy second dose. variable long second dose. point UK variant ‚Äúnew‚Äù anymore?

Come clickbait governor Texas thing. keep urging people sign rural counties sometimes get vaccine within days. Hmm, AD says something different. 4 million extra doses ordered, also extra doses next week result Pfizer able produce quicker. So, read 2 different things. wrong ofcourse. Yeah, definitely looks like typical Trump voter üôÑ Agreed, kidding saying well states handled vaccination procurement  Generally virus mutations less harmful. Evolutionarily helps spread. think asymptomatic spread makes difficult rule apply though. 

With vaccine drives boosters likely scenario covid mutate less harmful. covid mutates common cold illness covid vaccines much need unless vulnerable. Thus strain surviving. 

It's optimistic knowledge, knowledge based prior knowledge viruses. Think we'll hit 200m Bidens first 100 days? blue check twitter called mass murderer. hyperbole around covid bonkers. people assaulting Asians street almost always white. Bur, supply issue, problem vaccination process? though states struggle logistics vaccinating people, supply fine... Well, got nothing you. Haha think remember reading ago, completely forgot Stopping deaths higher priority stopping spread. feel pain. close family friend (80 year old) die covid weeks ago. Detroit's mayor turning away J&amp;J really pissed could easily used ease supply constraints and/or increase eligibility. 

As getting appts. Yes, hard. moment takes fanatical persistence knowing pharmacies populate system new slots. 

I able put Xbox iPhone pre-ordering skill good use. even surprised collapse related COVID. kind deep set Republicans think Bill Gates microchipping all, deep state, swamp yada yada probably declined vaccine... I'd imagine lot, most, doses go American arms. Biden plans enough doses American adults May, can't imagine Johnson Johnson manufacturing additional *hundred million* doses top they're already planning make within couple months.

The current plan enough doses American adults, send elsewhere. Considering hundred million Johnson Johnson doses would vaccinate almost half American adults, we'll enough doses initiate half adults end month, think even half doses ordered could end American arms. working finance... school/preschool closed. Managing work young kids time much. Sigh. I'm end list. Hoping open everyone soon!  US government stepped day two ago DPA manufacturers raw ingredients vaccines. speed backlog Pfizer J &amp; J vaccine.

What people don‚Äôt realize throughout pandemic US continuously exporting raw materials ingredients well components Covid vaccines. household joining end month! Allowing Pfizer Moderna (as well Johnson Johnson) export vaccines (that Canada purchased) US production lines donating doses.  allowing exports.  Canada currently getting doses Pfizer Moderna European Supply chains.  EU 'donating' vaccines Canada.  Canada purchased vaccines Pfizer Moderna. 

We need donations, need vaccines.  purchased already.  US simply allowing exports production lines inside US would enough Canada. even knows liberal areas higher quality living Redditors always get mad US cozy big business, gets mad US enjoying perks relationship. I‚Äôm surprised hasn‚Äôt started arresting anyone wearing mask. Criminalizing mask wearing ‚Äî sounds like solid GQP shit! Damn that's sad Oh buddy limp wrist now, stick chest it. I'm sorry, think China less authoritarian US opinion longer matters area Texas pretty normal least months now.  Restaurants bars absolutely packed.  still see lots people (80%+) wearing masks stores see continues today. Yes city live now. already causing superbugs hospitals wild, simple saying ""well never use antibiotics covid-19 patients"", one unfortunate aspects covid-19 often accompanied secondary bacterial infections, easily cause serious deadly issues patients. understandable doctor see something looks like could secondary infection treat immediately, instead waiting til gets hand make sure. Explain California then. way possible supply exceeds demand. Hopefully happens 50 states sometime next month so. different priority categories nice principle, lacking practicality. going keep priority, least stick age since (a) easy prove (b) hard argue against. feeling high school/middle school aged children get. JJ trials them? Abbott's moron Thanks link one interesting.
If drop really vaccine effect lock think big. Amen got email Vaccine Administration Management System saying I‚Äôm selected receive vaccine. legit? got first shot two days ago, bad people make (for me. ymmv). Right shot kept moving, reaching around front body grab opposite shoulder. Day after, felt like shit still totally usable. unable perform tasks would normally do. IE lifted 20 lbs charcoal able reach head close hatch car etc. Jealous. Can't wait state same, I'm itching get vaccine. yet. death rate even 60-70 much higher 40-50. lot people want shot, prioritized.

Most people 40 respecting honor system, everyone wants shot. afford wait another month prioritize older Americans. Please explain live Texas. opinion people taking seriously begin continue take seriously. friends cautious continue wear mask go occasionally likely vaccinated.

I honestly think thing change several instances customers getting mad employees businesses still choose enforce masks. really think get April clear situation Texas bad, businesses states start ease up. mom got yesterday little side-effects really don‚Äôt think many people going continue mask wearing social distancing pandemic. say little longer virtue signal might wear masks social distance little longer eventually people gonna revert back 2019 normal without masks social distancing. could one road doesn't, gets business. See pointless give mask mandate punishing people wearing mean law. mandates ignorant enforced serve political purpose. Here's says effectiveness reaches 96 percent fifteenth day full vaccination. days 7 14, 89%.

I think Pfizer began counting cases trial 7 days Moderna 14 days. That's designed trials, doubt there'd huge difference two week period. They're basically same. Sometimes real world results vaccinating millions people turn slightly different trials too. driven lot yesterday

I'd say backup plan. people know felt like hangover though, think one worst reactions. people.. Leeroy Jenkins! liking truth doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true.

I read poll, I‚Äôm talking reasons Americans don‚Äôt want vaccine. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre anti-vax , second world South Africa. developed nation. US no.1 anti vaccine data mate. yet find solid source actual difference threshold EUA full approval, proof/citations boot. Everything I‚Äôve found super super vague. anyone link anything? safety endpoints EUA, can‚Äôt give full approval? Well done putting study. Hope goes well you. Yeah, happening fast data still catch places Reporting weird. feds shipped 3.6M doses last week 460,000 reported yesterday - lots room grow. expect lot doses administered reported

That said, J&amp;J going snail's pace little large impact numbers, unfortunately. They're delivering 400k states next week. Good way describe it! 

My grandparents got second Pfizer doses yesterday felt good. 

A weeks I‚Äôll helping mom register! 

Wish could find spare dose husband one thing time. least know he‚Äôs safer I‚Äôm vaccinated. 

Hold folks! happening. Spring almost summer isn‚Äôt far behind.  anti maskers? one common sense things mentioned, it‚Äôs frankly smart improves everyone‚Äôs quality life. Goes way too. Columbus second largest city population midwest, metro gets outclassed Detroit, Twin Cities, Milwaukee, even way smaller cities like Cleveland St. Louis. looking city population might think Columbus huge city third largest metro state.

Yeah, counties great others lousy. mother got doses Moderna Hancock County. drove another county said people getting shots outside Hancock too. Hancock County Health Department, eastern Tennessee would totally effed. life, thought Hancock backwoods, least sophisticated county state Tennessee, COVID proven good folks Sneedville real deal lowest COVID rate state highest vaccination rate per capita. over, Hancock definitely vaccinated people live county done already.

No, could done already wore masks. People parties last summer cause us still situation March 2021. plan start *flatten* curve, happens curve flatten out? extends longer. frustrating see people trying snarky social media saying stuff like ""we're NEVER gonna get pandemic selfish people"" ""your parties keeping us lockdown longer""

It's somehow still happening right too, vaccines literally going out. disagree states ending mask mandate, think early, I've also seen general attitude ""we're close ending states gonna ruin everyone"" ""now we'll wait even longer"" etc. that's works.  "" allow exports AZ plants""

What even mean, vaccines bought paid actively used immediately? orders AZ plants countries demanding vaccines UK production plants?

The UK virtually vaccine manufacturing capability 12 months ago. paid facilities created domestic production, first 100m doses start exporting. talk ""non-existing vaccines"" dont get it. Nothing stops anyone exporting vaccines.

Even EU since backed claims, hopefully learn stfu future. read CNN article said exactly headline lol. Part Pfizer vaccine produced UK, exported

The knowledge produce Oxford vaccine (at cost) exported, people went India help set example

I post link result post deleted Gaza  Tbh shots arms good thing, I'm less concerned ""tourism"" states fumble bad drive people go states. I'm Illinois, people Indiana example would rather come mass vaccination site there's nothing decent near them. federal government really needs make sure sites available everywhere want make sure tourism happen. they‚Äôre inept. tell using vaccine tracker see percentage doses used (GA instance 65%) Part Pfizer vaccine produced UK, exported

The knowledge produce Oxford vaccine (at cost) exported, people went India help set example

I post link result post deleted Probably less months! could looking vaccination late April. what's going happen everybody wants 50 vaccinated? open since disease even close dangerous young people? Depends much mean normal. 

The extreme side - never talk mention covid outside past tense? need wait kids able get vaccine wont early next year. ""end"" health professional point view next summer. 

The ""social"" end? happen summer.  adults want vaccine get one (by May latest that), everything go back normal.

The ""personal"" end? Thats get vaccine. 

The thing thats air schooling looks like next fall. Specifically - masks? doubt see hybrid model, could see top parents still keeping kids remote really small numbers. think school normal kids kids again, never underestimate power school age parent-Karens. clarify anyone wondering UK two dose regimen Pfizer AZ administering second dose 12 weeks first. Sure, change anything.

**Except 4 million extra people getting shot, might actually save lives.**

Which might realize pulled head ass. Go visit hospital see many people old people fallen bed... 


Doubling naivety makes look stupid. anyone else gotten second COVID dose found sleeping way much? got COVID vaccine last Tuesday typically sleep 5-7 hours night, I've slept 12 hours three last seven nights I'm little worried. freedoms? Freedom movement association? mention fact millions people around world still essentially house arrest, perhaps indefinitely? No, believe boss though 9.6 percent. Turns wrong. data given incorrect well. Hospitalizations certainly decreased 90 percent. deaths. like wishful thinking much next person, claiming we're done covid delusion. people keep ignoring this, liky see another surge. Large chains infected even less populated areas, everywhere. Name place gone back normal give evidence proves wrong. think am. talking efficacy preventing disease. Obviously.

Seeing never used terms efficacy discussing, would obvious never claimed alluded less.efficscious preventing severe disease. 

Well, no, discuss efficacy preventing severe disease all. calling ""complete"" joke all. Without knowledge different efficacy rates different categories, people could assume 72% applies prevention death well. like proof people make mistake, would inconsequential find someone making assumption efficacy rate symptomatic cases applies prevention severe illness death. 

So, yeah, glossing stuff even get discussion regarding ENSEMBLE II. I'm DED! ü§£ it‚Äôs already late one needs crappy Astrazeneca anymore. enough German biontech. need now. Davis students even go spring break? Tahoe? got vaccine tampa, FL didn‚Äôt ask ID insurance. hospital I‚Äôm already patient, maybe that‚Äôs why. can‚Äôt hurt call ask documentation needed. imply would shot guy, actions actually reasonable light? 

Say what?

It‚Äôs bold strategy Cotton, let‚Äôs see pays off. Bill Gates? BMI 40+ qualify 15th California. It‚Äôs one qualifying health issues. Yeah, besides mask mandates private businesses, South Carolina pretty darn normal. Bars restaurants packed essentially maskless months. Nobody even mentioning social distancing anymore. I‚Äôd expect private businesses start dropping mandates Memorial Day so. I‚Äôm expecting summer 99-100% normal (it‚Äôs already 85% normal moment, I‚Äôd say). WTF? course do. long vaccines must first sent UK people UK done vaccination it‚Äôs ban. matter kind semantics UK tries use there.
Pathetic.  stated medical experts opinion, it‚Äôs literally paragraph. What‚Äôs wrong stating opinion matter? actually read wrote would see medical experts say. really sure isn‚Äôt getting coverage. excellent news UK variant scare going time US. crickets. Steady decline nation wide cases. 

18.3% 1st dose absolutely fucking massive. Consider picking pace, much room 4th peak. Now, turns Pfizer Moderna effective South African variant (no real proof far), we're fucked regardless... Fortunately, reports awful, say 10 fold less effective, say 10 percent. 10 percent nothing worry about, we're nuts think 85% extremely effective. 

A couple weeks restrictions, another couple weeks... another variant, another couple weeks. going work.  Meanwhile MD still 65+ WTF? course do. long vaccines must first sent UK people UK done vaccination it‚Äôs ban. matter kind semantics UK tries use there. 

Pathetic. moment, yes. UK received first 100 million doses Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine produced within borders, country start exporting/donating Covax. including overweight, smokers, people heart conditions (without specifying conditions quality), lax. essential worker categories also extremely broad. states, opened anyone conditions essential workers, ANYBODY twist pretzel enough qualify. Combine messaging eligible go get vaccine, we're checking sure qualify extremely lax criteria system overwhelmed everybody trying sign up. 

And yes CRITERIA plural. go Destin last winter. usually person wearing mask anywhere. ones pulled asses sterile thrown out. lebron wishy washy wants. lives LA healthy (checks google) 36 year old decide another couple months. presumably want deal side effects season/playoffs gives till june make decision. order get vaccine completed olympics he'd get first dose june 17 (assuming arrive tokyo week ahead) 

(checks google again)

well damn, finals end july 22 makes finals he's going olympics anyway guess, either way earliest first dose that's either july 23 (4 months now) august Blue anon strikes again. soon. 

I would rather age. 50 older 35 older sometime April. May open everyone soon, opinion. Bro vaccine works well SA variant. crowning achievement life would like brag instead? We'll fine summer. Worst case, fine always readjust plan, IMO seems highly unlikely.  oooo. Good idea. love laminating stuff. Others problem -- use this: 100% able find one willing drive little bit check couple times day. too. Libertarians certainly support local government regulating everything. know value constitution ok giving dozen people ability another go slavery.  him, *wasn't* able say, muted. He's said plenty now.

And CDC Director pretty much saying ""our numbers garbage administration allow us tell truth"" maybe pay fucking attention change. well immune system able see four friends weekend. tested negative getting together WFH cautious. skied, stayed house otherwise.

Was nice realistically make plans summer. see often, saw even less COVID, literally planned something every month starting May. social activist cares pubic policy issues knows says important influences people. also months talk family, consult doctors, scientists, public health officials, activists, inform come thinks best thing public. point everyone knows ""I'll talking family deciding too"" means a) he's hesitant taking vaccine himself, b) really intend words encourage people look get vaccinated either. end day NBA player doctor I'm going harp much getting wrong, clearly irresponsible decision. Totally agree. feel like I've 99.9th percentile Covid caution really sure would good eating restaurant wearing mask places (without knowing every single person vaccinated too). risk resistant variants, trumpies, developing countries reservoirs due able vaccinate enough people, feel it'll take lot get hump 100th percentiles even 99.9ths. Hmmm good point. Idk though I'm sharing everything forgetting borders.I know Utopia man dream. could also make point country take necessary precautions punished it. 
Also long Hungary bring back democracy cry want getting help eu maybe fix problems first. Aaaaaaaayoooooooo! Cool, Let's ignore data says nearly 70% Americans - AGAIN, par countries - buy crap form first place. Let's ignore Russia outpaces SA US hardcore anti vaxxers. Let's ignore bulk vaccine hesitants - like developed world - concerned side effects, ineffectiveness simply complacent disease. Let's ignore claim country average enthusiasm vaccine somehow bulwark anti vaccine sentiment raging jingoist priapism.

I mean, facts matter Brexit voted on, hell matter here? [here  random. competitive bias ones spread faster, means attacking host effectively. longer term bias keeping host infectious long possible. 

Since dead hosts stop infectious, eventually selects non-lethal. catch ""eventually"" don‚Äôt think true unfortunately. Western Pharma pulling Europe decade favour USA it‚Äôs likely AZ Russia/china‚Äôs vaccines used long run developing nations. Yeah, opposite anything, truth complicated. I'm getting vaccine hoping trump idiots cause many variants. I'll returning normal life vaccine got full effectiveness next month. care CDC fauci says knowingly lied masks. email said due ‚Äúthe ongoing public health crisis.‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt surprised either tour promoter and/or venue postponed idea restrictions would five months. live PA, one conservative states far restrictions go. Right 15% capacity indoor events. 

But think you‚Äôre right way too. argument usually turns international travel, ignoring Florida sees international tourists New York. 

Florida escaped earliest surge weather. It‚Äôs gorgeous late winter/early spring. People don‚Äôt stay inside. That‚Äôs first surge happened summer, it‚Äôs actually fucking miserable outside.  Racists San Francisco? don‚Äôt say... change today. Honestly single thing changed. major cities (Austin, Houston, Dallas) 90+% comply stores, indoors. small towns dip like 30-50% compliance stores. think week next see drop off. Maybe 10-30% fewer people complying. imagine smalls towns weeks start look pre pandemic. know couple people Texas main issue restrictions, virus. soon mask mandates lift they'll never wear mask again. I'm sure depends social circle though. people might seem like everyone takes seriously others might seem like nobody gives shit. depends hang with, like-minded people tend attract eachother. also confidence ability turn boosters.

Confidence thing depending something completely unknown. keep repeatedly getting wrong. state CV today *will not* state CV 6 months. plenty unknowns several positive pieces news, every expert I've read listened says absolutely TIME fuck around find out.

Again, link posted would explain chose Further, think zero COVID goal.

Of course, that's goal, attainable anytime soon. may never attainable likelihood, CV19 around long time. fucked let spread far much. There's putting genie back bottle viruses. either kill off.

The goal get infections level vaccines able essentially stop community spread. We're extremely lucky live time actually vaccinate mRNA virus. That's huge probably save millions lives.

But CDC director said interview places, keep rate spread (the R0 number) *will* mutate. viruses do. Every additional case exists means roll dice see new mutation happen.

Over time, viruses *tend* become contagious less (directly) deadly behoove virus kill host replicate. problem there's negative killing host *after* fact, lots places virus hides potentially resurface later.

This ""99% people survive!"" thing absolute stupidity know anything viruses. Google Post-polio syndrome unaware. extreme example, CV19 mutates become even infectious, asymptomatic spread long-term lung organ damage large chunk otherwise healthy population?

THIS experts telling people patient little longer. goal get things control NOWHERE near now. nothing else, need give already overworked healthcare professionals first responders break.
