COVID harmless disease, also allowed kill people global elite (hint: know who's) conspiring cover miraculous cure, hydroxychloroquine.

BLM protests dangerous gatherings need stopped, restricting gatherings infringes freedoms.

The CDC, scientists, doctors, authorities lying us, CDC says schools open, trust authority.

The Jews simultaneously genetically inferior, secretly pull strings major geopolitical decisions.

Do notice trend? Florida seemed fine. Got mumps two years ago, despite vaccinated twice kid. severe case, mild either (inflamed testicles weird experience). diagnosed post-viral fatigue month still feel quite healthy normal.

For three months after, low energy able focus hour becoming exhausted could lie maybe watch tv. Mind you, one hour focus includes socializing, playing games, ""fun"" things. 

&amp;#x200B;

The strange thing was, one day woke one hour work, prepared go lie down, realize mind clear brain fog etc gone; one day next! yeah, virus strange thing take toll body, much beyond ""actual"" illness. completely changed mind think viruses I've careful ever since. virus that's around long time, know lots about!! Doctors nurses risking lives fight pandemic people still going bars beaches.  not? say so? credentials make claim? 

Pick favorite, 169 bring reading glasses ""Yes, significantly worse Asian countries similar populations population densities."" 

""But man feel like people enjoy dunking Japan""

You posted two sentences post.

India similar population less developed. India terribly mean Japan done well. rationalizing hinders pandemic response. Agree completely. President mad man. It‚Äôs really terrifying.... Feels like nightmare. Holy shit. voice reason. Good show. seem people loudly calling schools open ones least respect education... Superintendent says context.... Fails show context. 

Time break the, ""let's see ends 2-3 weeks."" Pooled sampling useful case numbers low. fraction percent cases positive really reduce numbers tests. massive outbreaks testing hitting higher 5% positive pretty useless pools pretty high chance getting positive everyone pool needing individual tests. number new coronavirus cases Utah stayed 400 Tuesday, percentage tested patients receive positive results remains high ‚Äî means low testing numbers could masking spread virus, according infectious disease specialist.
 
Yes, easy keep new cases low test.  Clinical trials monoclonal antibodies, potential prevent / treat Covid 19 (increased immunity several months) progress probably come vaccinations (Fauchi assume) also serve indicator effectiveness vaccines Maybe testing/external events, hey, NC lately. peak far 19.29 cases per 100,000 (7 day average) 7/18, today got 16.45 cases per 100,000 (7 day average).

Wake, Mecklenburg, Durham, Orange County numbers quite bit, write message, numbers lot % wise overall state number, yeah, dumb shits might winning. time.  February: ""Things ugly couple weeks""

March: Record breaking cases daily

April: ""Things ugly couple weeks""

June: Record breaking cases daily Could worse. could New York grandparents nursing homes Governor forcing Covid-positive patients into! me, seem bad one country half cases 40% deaths.  must good job handling it. Another one.  What's guys?

I mean, even Jehovah's Witnesses staying home... Thats redundant. Trump already fine job really doubt you‚Äôre interested good-faith discussion all, anyone else interested...

First, Fauci others emphasized sit-down interviews it‚Äôs important put school aged kids single group, kids 10 much, much safer general population, although kids 10 fatality rates orders magnitude higher number. 

Fatality children aside, real risk comes kids age spreading virus, as, although we‚Äôre still learning new things every day, studies pretty consistently shown viral load contributes greatly individual‚Äôs severity symptoms ability spread virus, recent study South Korea suggests older children spread virus much adults do. Dr Fauci say need get cases 10,000 nation fall? get sick 'cause ain't good chrstian It‚Äôs exposure. longer exposure, likely virus transmitted. Teachers spending 7+ hours students every day. don‚Äôt know grocery customers shop 5 days week stay store 7 hours time. Retail stores factories provide masks put plexiglass, etc. Teachers employees provide protection, like supply pencils, paper, paper towels, etc every school year. 
The long-term health effects Covid discovered alarming. Damage multiple organs devastating year behind academically. child learns multiply age ten instead age nine, that‚Äôs big deal. child brings home Covid loses parent, psychological trauma overwhelming. 
My school district provided breakfast lunch students schools closed spring. Kids don‚Äôt lose feeding program instruction online. test ofc Florida gonna ‚Äúhave cases‚Äù Wrong. Testing backlogged. results last week. Boom. roasted. people thinking??? Who's say hit goose way died fowl play? god want us listen doctors invented medical schools.  Nah gonna happen.

I mean people pretty willing go back normal without vaccine. Thanks link:) look see. I'm sorry, utterly absurd. begs question rushing get vaccines (plural) door we're going limit crowds, socially distance, wear masks, etc. next several years anyway article states?

If I've said once, I've said thousand times: Humanity wrestled far, far worse diseases epidemics one, disrupted daily life anywhere even close long. vaccines pharmaceutical treatments thing. COVID managed way manage influenza, vaccines non-intrusive non-disruptive public health measures. Yes, still continue disruptive measures COVID vaccines treatments rolled out, order months, years. 

Being public health expert absolve making moronic declarations. distributed right people, obviously awesome widespread vaccination good goal vaccinate everyone vulnerable healthcare workers teachers etc American, find Troubles Wikipedia. Nobody taught us anything history class past Vietnam War American history world history typically past rather recent. Trending down, down, down. think safely say seeing downward trend now. deny nothing halfbaked conspiracy theory.

Lol nice r/wallstreetbets parody. Well done. ages ago though. Tech advanced since than. video shared cloud definitely grainy VHS crap unless potato phone.

If budget it, even hire professional videographer. I've seen results actually quite impressive. I'm sentimental guy I'm probably going give crap, imagine bride female members family digging years later go weepy it.

But goes hell afterwards cos outbreak, expect anyone would wanting watch afterwards... now, months, people found something else use. time meet demand next year, may much demand huge surplus hand. demand now, least five months meet it. many quotes Sci-Fi authors like Asimov Heinlein fit current situation actually somewhat unsettling bad bay area (though could better) grandma lives Westminster I'm scared her. visiting family Lynchburg last week honestly surprised amount people wearing masks compared back home(Williamsburg, VA).  think race.

Nah, I‚Äôm pretty sure people planning doctor perfectly fine online schooling‚Äîit‚Äôs easier cheat way. Cruise ships like mega covid parties.

Someday, pandemic end go Disney world cruise ships traveling Europe. right now, world sick. never understand comments. Things could much better winter/next spring want social distancing part life forever? Maybe joking. idea could train thought man seriously   Teenagers ones hospitals though maybe small amount nothing crazy able approach problem perspective ""smart people versus dumb people"" think already missed point. louder people back

#RED FLAG ""You can't that.""  I'm doctor, sounds like hypoxia. Covid 19 attacks damages lungs makes hard profusion happen. Without proper profusion, enough oxygen get bloodstream therefore brain get enough oxygen. results scary.  Wow let‚Äôs make regional prejudice. Racism okay long it‚Äôs white conservatives. live small town North Carolina, wear masks. anti-maskers every state. New York epicenter pandemic entire world. Currently California half million infected. isn‚Äôt rural south. Though Florida definitely isn‚Äôt helping, neither Texas. let‚Äôs generalize damage COVID 19 push agenda.  cops murder people get year paid leave teachers can't get paid leave die virus? Ok America That's what's guys great handle good leadership is, America live completely fucked pretty sure turned political statement wear mask instead science. Especially older population believed real first 2 months. Perhaps recommendations? God's will. biggie. idiots know didn‚Äôt make week first one. They‚Äôve vacationed Arizona twice since big party weekend. It‚Äôs amazing watch. honestly believe nothing wrong. get enough attention saying ""Florida bad."" Hospitalizations declining couple weeks. pretty, far over, Florida past peak cases peak week next deaths. grow empty toilet paper tubes watered Everclear. Paper towels soap/cleaner work too.  Especially cruise ships. 

I know boomers like months flames comes cruises, need total imbecile get cruise right now. 

Even get CV may locked month. ‚ÄúLeft spit face‚Äù ? type wording going guess ain't boomers found there. Oh agree. said 2 years. certain point people really won‚Äôt able afford food.  Also NY got 4 hours. Granted er. This. different doctors claiming hospitals brink overwhelmed weeks never happen.

Nothing going come kids back school. area received good deal feedback mask use schools. Wearing mask personal choice practical way enforce mandate wear them. continue strongly encourage students staff wear masks.‚Äù

Ridiculous. high school would police shit dress code. ""Put hands make sure shorts past fingertips"". ""No tank tops!"". suddenly can't force people wear masks?

Edit: Like make sense. Wearing tank top personal choice. affect anyone else (hurrrr distract boys learning) that's problem. wearing mask affect people. Dying home fuckjng corona Everyone kids agrees one thing: don‚Äôt listen. Doesn‚Äôt matter is. Thank you!

Anti science ~ pro cavemen Well thanks valuable opinion. jobs allow wear mask? live cannot think single job allow masks. Everyone local restaurants around wears masks. 

And missing key aspect. economy going crash burn regardless. Even open everything say go on, many people willing take risks. Employment still suffer restaurants, venues, hotels, etc... forced lay staff align current business. Many close. 

The truth need act now, well ago, now. Saving economy works controlling spread. experts said beginning. Take hit now, take take massive hit later extended period time. 

People dying COVID able afford food. Opening everything small bandaid massive gaping wound. I've thinking flooding joke lot lately. I'd kinda like make pandemic version post ""God save me-- even though flout stay home orders, refuse wear mask, social distance little possible"" relatives. 

I know damn well God gave information need stay safe, God gave resources could stay home chose, God certainly gave enough sewing skills make masks. God I'd pretty pissed people 21st century insisting catching plague. Stooooooopid fucks absolutely agree need vaccine. point slightly less effective vaccine would still make huge difference, even prevent infections, would likely make remaining infections less severe- similar flu vaccine non-included strains. part ""Kaepernick/lewis etc need sit shut up! sentiment.

You know, people think ""the ""good ones know place""

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* must desperate he's suddenly trying something party politicized much would anyone care judging people? Even so, would anyone care feel judged?

Maybe take break reddit. infected latent tuberculosis trip abroad. totally experienced weird brain fog years after. infection never even took lungs. dormant. think response immune system created hell body.

It's hard explain sometimes like map brain would disappear know streets behind streets neighborhood grew in. Sometimes would start writing sentence know finish would forget mid sentence writing. might things little bit time time much intrusive. would write things order would hear them. sometimes would try say one word another word would come mouth. People thought funny terrifying idea jacked brain fun one consider.

 scared permanent. Thank goodness years seemed get brain back. took lot bravery even apply grad school insecurity mental faculties. 

 learned valuable lesson though. mess around pandemics. Even survive might lasting effects suck. Try avoid costs. Go away 250... image look weeks cases skyrocket region.

This really sad irresponsible. kids? wear masks parents next reminding them. minute see friends, people haven‚Äôt seen months, goes window. takes one kid classroom touching toys, tables, friend, locker, door. Kids vectors, may get sick adults bring home infect parents. managed better minimized community spread, would better off. many people think fuck everyone else. Yes maybe we'll adopt going forward died down. Probably would nice. Less stress. ever seen 40-something stressed overworked deskjockey male heart attack, rocket science. Yeah... I'm getting either.

Why people unemployed wear mask? probably destroys virus too. I'm extremely dubious 30 day claim. good article NYT. say cytokine-storm happening people ""too healthy"". state ""It even young people children underlying conditions"" define meant ""no underlying conditions"" goes say ""People diabetes, obesity hypertension higher baseline inflammation, it‚Äôs also possible, said, may explain particularly vulnerable becoming seriously ill."" well, highest day around 15k....everything else since July 12k lower Right CDC:

Quality could explain pre-existing opinion. family would send siblings camps, save PTO help summer coverages, modify work schedule slightly reduce coverage hours needed, grandparent come town week time, send siblings family SAHM, soon turned 10, oldest would watch two younger siblings 6ish hours parent home. 

A lot sustainable long term, managed 8-12 weeks summer. ? definitely without things quite while. Yeah, hope article gets attention it‚Äôs due! son getting married, maybe celebrating later. may miss son's wedding makes sad, agreement risky right now. Btw, we've visit, immediate family's still risky. Already missed helping move house. sit days jail instead. always wondered would pay sit. never really got along many scummy private hospitals city. Even civil hospital scummy. Functional ventilators work, read article bud, information right there. 1/10 people ventilators survived. it‚Äôs last ditch effort. what‚Äôs this? liberal doesn‚Äôt believe humanitarianism? My, well that‚Äôs first. states much better blue ones, bad states Florida Texas(both actually pretty mixed.) go look Idaho Montana. Two states controlled Republicans lowest numbers.

The democratic governed states NY, NJ California claimed 36.5% total deaths country. I‚Äôm going keep arguing fact, clear point.

Cons don‚Äôt understand economics , that‚Äôs funny. oppose socialism county it‚Äôs always way, libs aren‚Äôt gonna change it. 

So again, we‚Äôre admitting Fauci doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs talking actually blood hand. guy, last 35 years working it, failed produce working vaccine HIV. put blind trust him. probably morbid brave family assume people watch video wedding catch virus. Might true, article focuses immunity individuals developed prior contact viruses Covid-19  really think realistic cancel sports events, concerts, large parties 2-3 years. Randian spotted found Walmart last week. Felt like winning lottery. necessary love it. like become aroused it. Wow coincidence. Philippines also recent news government health insurance sector dealing fraud one Philippines clearly fraud n corruption n theft within government itself.

For wanting bit source, = P5x

Horrific part many health workers running less $200-300 month salary less highly unequipped patients covered well P15 Billion stolen plus issues. Imho casino close dc. many people. scanning temperature? entrance. Everyone wear mask. aisles still narrow people get pretty close. hours 6-7 hours there, saw possibly one worker clean briskly ONE machine (although didn‚Äôt see actually clean one machine). really didn‚Äôt make effort clean machines. also heard women‚Äôs bathrooms terrible. people pass closely (knowing shouldn‚Äôt). absolutely go back casino, awful. Gamble money also health (life). really thought would make effort dont cant pay ??  gas chambers go ? White House managing covid data, sure sites like Worldometer accurate US? every time go Target sort disinfecting wipe Pretty much yeh trump, trump suckers citizens government officials including governors, anti-maskers, karens help spread virus america sounds better.  I‚Äôve seen one recently small size $8.50. Stared like üëÅüëÑüëÅ think Australia is. might testing. 

NZ virtually eradicated it. might mean testing much well.  know trust numbers portion tests counted.

Isn't texas also turning away patients still? stopped.  That's thing, many people dismiss death toll ""it is"" ""(so bullshit comparison) kills many people year covid kills....""
But neglect fact there's gonna potential long term side effects thing numbers far greater.


Seriously, people avoid catching virus, fucking avoid it!!!! Hopefully many people hospital system outlook you. end sick time, hospitals may run beds... shocking, think New Zealand isolated economy? get comments friends time irritate sh*t me. Like might take years us go back normal, we‚Äôre gonna go back normal sooner later. Unlikely. 7 months since Wuhan hit. heard substantial percentage cases ""rolling in.""

These types viruses unlikely work way. likely triggering state hyperinflammation blood vessels increases tendency clot small percentage vulnerable young people.

Imo, idea need lockdown non-fatal sequelae disease bit overblown sounds like illness anxiety disorder real failire breakdown risks longterm outcomes contextual frames.

I'm doctor btw.  Boomer shit. encourage go safely want to. I, personally, tried disliked normal felt. mind masks anything. mindset less want make outings quick I'm enjoying taking time. 

 also backyard pool go swimming relaxed summer part. I'll eventually head beach local summer starts here. avoiding mostly many state people come here. 

My husband cousins go drinking outdoor bars marinas every chance get. think nuts good them? guess. worry could possible spread others get sick. 


Anyways, people judge matter decision make. one weigh risks. Hope helps bit. understand confusing around times. safe much love. first wave never ended. simply leveled bit.

It's called ""epidemic/pandemic"" anymore spread levels off. mean absolutely zero cases, means control now. many countries really manage get control, new cases weeks. asking that? players could opted wanted to. didn't, despite tantrums. Whenever, wherever

We're meant together God forbid corporate America countless overpaid politicians get less money. *must* protect wallets filthy rich! Cain died low speed motorcycle crash wearing helmet helmet law state, would agree you. didn't. engaged risky behavior led death probably others line. never let hospital risk lives medical professionals there. Maybe people get fed enough, selfish assholes like get enjoy freedom home, dying. no, money fame. It'll someone else's grandpa gets discharged without chance. say ""the sky green,"" that's opinion. That's false.

If say ""closing wrong,"" that's opinion. That's false. course money fucking reason always company releases positive news stock market hours would experience exact result. zero evidence insider trading pretty much clue stock market works. god help smh mean yeah, much celebrate days. Places like China Spain virus multiple months yet real studies/data shown people get reinfected, think say chances getting reinfected low non existing. Funny change ""one highest mortality rates world"" comparison realize picked wrong state compare with.

States similar size Sweden (which 10.2 mil people 569 deaths / mil) +/- 2 mil population:

Illiois 12.8m - 611 deaths /mil

Pennsylvania 12.7m - 572 deaths /mil

Ohio 11.5m - 306 deaths /mil

Michigan 9.8m - 648 deaths /mil

Georgia 9.6m - 369 deaths /mil

North Carolina 9.5m - 194 deaths /mil

New Jersey 8.8m - 1793 deaths /mil

Virginia 8.0m - 263 deaths /mil

From 8 states similar size picked one least deaths compare correction, half higher death count country ""one highest mortality rates world"". every US state listed separate entry, rather people average country's mortality, would 13 states listed Sweden ladder. hope sister. One tooth infection chronic fatigued unbearable life her. Hopefully people get isn‚Äôt lazy Trump removed stickers, part, wanted packed house. ironic thing people *had* spread more, turnout might looked embarrassing. ‚ÄúIn 5th grade, told south would civil war, slaves lazy except running away.‚Äù

I think brain exploded.

Thousands Texans getting rapid-result COVID tests. state isn‚Äôt counting  Good luck. still boomers think devil lives technology. might never recover. might die later time damage caused virus even partially recovered.  Yeah, sure. debt all... wish could hear Americans one day finally acknowledge republicans intentionally mishandle pandemic, choosing slow death strategy win election. democrats watching sideline ignoring dead bodies cheering republican's mistakes. wish finally see democracy freedom speech nothing American ""dreams"". votes count. American ppl chose Trump establishment absolutely fucked 4 years finally mentally broke poor guy. wiretapping candidacy, phony Muller investigation stole mid term election, comedy level ""peach"". Trump fears life facing Julian Assange treatment lost. called freedom speech....where The_Donald? unpopular speech needs protection! Americans understand meaning freedom speech. read article, issue title, appears people‚Äôs feeds. La Times usually less sensational, titularly. Okay COVID like common cold, would expect vaccine work? cell immunity observed SARS survivors **years** infection.  would it? point thing think matters many people knew someone, personally, died. 2-3 years social distancing?! o.O

But supposed celebrate Halloween?! can't go long without Halloween goodness! Tuition technically covers cost class, usually person online class, he's suing based tuition alone I'm sure much ground has. Now, kicked dorms, refund room board, give refund campus related fees (prorated since semester roughly ~50% over) see case. Unfortunately schools would get sued either way, stay open students/families sue putting danger. win situation university. see winning tuition alone. Disclaimer I'm lawyer though, someone works within higher education. Yes, speculation vaccines risky mention morally dubious. doubt data vaccine accurate any, Donald Trump actually paid high profile visit Novavax. Novavax hadn‚Äôt profitable years, hadn‚Äôt ever developed vaccine got approved understand. source article also highly dubious. Whatever do, give email!! push pump dump schemes, never rid inbox. whole country strike disaster liars keep acting like nothing happening. wrong. party busy thing. virus magically spread mass gatherings long they're woke? fruit lasts way longer wash soon get home - including wiping plastic berries come in. took major car wreck and/or DUI get MANY PEOPLE know quit drinking driving.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Okay I‚Äôll bite. I‚Äôm bit skeptical. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs impossible virus seems myriad effects seemingly interacts nervous system couldn‚Äôt make someone experience type fatigue.

But...this conducted survey. nurses. Many work night shift. global pandemic. many nurses working shifts? survey question regarding fatigue worded? experience patients, ask fatigue, almost say yes. Everyone tired. Fatigue tough measure it‚Äôs subjective, frankly many people don‚Äôt sleep well baseline. 

So I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt plausible. saying amongst sea bad, headline bit alarmist. think preachers care faith bottom line, living fantasy land. RemindMe! 4 months.

Those cities never see second wave. someone severe chronic fatigue syndrome started post viral fatigue years ago hope means finally see focus curing conditions! watch Fox News? otherwise consume conservative media? Fatality rates sorted age according British data: (Click IFR tab, Age) oh absolutely were, like also stated article. used got refused put one asked know wipes work way, right? France. Truth told, can't really blame them. We'll likely around for... indefinitely.

Yes, stupid wear one. intend live mask rest life either. stop sports all. Dancing. Social meetings. BBQ. Etc. yes, sometimes understand people fed (outside, enclosed space). understand others want wear 100% time.

I hope vaccine come soon. Might solve lot issues. Ive already lost 4 family members TN virus. going go home dip waited see persisted. probably won‚Äôt able safely go home while. Still making profit would better headline. sub filled people want sense hopelessness. Covid problem solvable. vaccines lessen hospital overloads time goes on/treatments improve. virus gonna remain unchecked. countries struggling contain virus. Australia entered second lockdown met tons controversy. Germany lockdown protests. UK openly said lock again. Spain seeing second wave places get hit first time around. 6 months everyone gonna realize Sweden place handled COVID right come blue collar/military side. CBR (Chemical/Biological/raeiological) response training pretty thorough. Later career aviation safety inspector, learned whole lit general shelf respirators related equipment.

The amount ignorance astounding. Thinking valved masks fine. Thinking one person needs it. exposure actually works (no holding face seconds pass people helping), etc. never shutdown 15 days moron. Thia could like episode Futurama South Park. Either completely top satire comedy South Park stupid talking head Futurama. Flu season kills 36,000 people year, multiple strains flu.

ItS LiKe dA FLu! /s bet? you, medical researcher front lines figuring virus? Give break. layman goddamn clue. Hope best, plan absolute worst.

Even affects year two, worth it? Absolutely not. idea, daughter staying home. really thought would've reversed now. Maybe hopeful am. Idk. yeah district full open virtual learning option. hope able attend later year. interested right now. white house charge executive branch. CDC part executive branch. checks white house's power one actually pulling levers either dependent white house politically want take responsibility. church take care own. money plenty spare. really need money good work sick, talk ever holds purse strings Catholic church instead pan handling time.  Well one, teach metric system...

And secondly, wear masks. Cellphone data shows people stayed home since numbers shot up, social distance graphs based cellphone mobility. we‚Äôre really badly don‚Äôt like headline doesn‚Äôt make disinformation. article, read it, makes attempt draw inaccurate comparisons. thought start Sweden like Netherlands testing hospitals, changing May testing expanded include staff public symptoms. 

Sweden acknowledged nursing homes deaths high never made clear cases counted outside hospital setting. Fire works best. That‚Äôs ye olde days Black Death. little cases reinfection people getting released early flair  God help us all. 

will ever go away? suddenly leave mutates (wishfully) deadly. like 24 hour cold.

the economy going pretty screwed differentiate COVID-19 samples samples respiratory viruses though? sounds like they‚Äôre using healthy samples negatives. smell covid actual virus sniff up? virus damage many people without killing them

I repeat basically anywhere everywhere - whenever there's something like ""teachable moment"", something like remind people of. Death *not* negative outcome disease.

Although say ""remind"", would imply knew one point - thing get many people seem - *still* - completely unaware this.

Honestly, watch TV - cut cord years ago - message getting there? repeated every day? Yes, people, odds good *die* disease - that's low bar, gives false comfort. 

You. Do. Not. Want. This. Disease. daily US numbers? Wow almost like free healthcare relaxed immigration policies horrible combination.

Thinking people ""believe science"" ""deny science"" really primitive thought. never lockdown social distancing policies.
I hate idea ‚Äúsweden nothing look well worked‚Äù
People socially distanced, mass gatherings banned, people cannot visit elderly relatives, people working home, schools universities shut early.
They reduced spread communal attitude common sense. They‚Äôve compassionate one another.
They haven‚Äôt reached magical herd immunity, they‚Äôve done still social distancing method reduces spread. 
The difference kept excess death still functioning healthcare system. Great example, also examples ones I've seen commonly used, trying downplay covid comparing cold car crash death. 

At point best thing people take precautions, genuinely lose nothing it. liberties stripped wear mask??? something looks promising guarantee 100% success rate (not vaccine 100% efficiency rate). skipping lot protocols process vaccines rushing thus lot information efficiency still big blur. I'm friend, ok teacher, go look lazy bum really want know. deaths category? Please enlighten me. ""If healthy, need wearing them""

&amp;#x200B;

This another problem here. many people fail understand person feels healthy mean virus reason dangerous people highly infectious still seem healthy. Apparently areas Australia currently going second wave people infected, showing zero symptoms slipped testing process began infecting dozens people without realizing it. weren‚Äôt associated fine. led people selfishly ignoring mandate big style. quarantine inspired shell cash upgrade USR Sportster 14.4kbps modem. good enough make quality connections Yale? may be. concrete evidence yet, way early know this. many possibilities. Patients develop hundreds antibodies, one cause ADE. maybe neutrilizing antibodies stronger ADE causing antibodies stop disease happens. not. happens subset patients.

What happens neutrilizing antibody levels fall insufficient antibody levels lead ADE? observed diseases, protective antibodies causing ADE levels low.

 easily write 20 scenarios top head. thousands things learn Covid-19, without virus mutating phenotypically different subtype. Unless find miracle vaccine thing going go years. Trump: case numbers high test much! 

Person: Ok, death rate relative population instead. worse.

Trump: can't that! Elementary school kickbacks compare kickbacks military contractors...sorry.-- politicians. happened months ago. 

People traveling like normal summer. 

It's not. Article says end, brain badly damaged virus, family told would never wake again. brain damage caused lack oxigen. thing stop spread besides shutdown giving everyone full biosafety suits, scorched earth. Supply delivery staff, staff, maintenance workers, ...the list endless. Freedom killed football.   Anyone Arizona here? people actually wearing masks taking seriously?  complaints really resonate me. 

If spend much time parents, discover hobby complaining. school. kid's friends. cost everything. Etc. unsurprising complaining lot right now.

I agree complaints lack understanding school's plans valid complaint. pandemic sucks everyone. reserving sympathy single parents, essential workers.  extinction! extinction! I'm Italy, precisely Modena, Emilia-Romagna: people Rimini, city near sea, everything following rules: wearing masks, going crowded discos respecting social distancing. everything see internet true, unfortunately also Italy there's still people understand behave period like want work get free things. dumbass that?  Ty this! don‚Äôt want people getting sick. There‚Äôs lot loved ones danger dying this. Wouldn‚Äôt forgive put someone. won‚Äôt take name big wedding, therefore still means something make marriage complete. 

I always wanted originally get married Halloween, since it‚Äôs Saturday year didn‚Äôt want take kid‚Äôs parents away could best Halloween them. made November 7th. get get married legally Halloween!

Who knows kids even get Halloween? I‚Äôm making fun nephews giving pi√±ata things could enjoy. want best day ever!!! classroom. Can't make masks mandatory classroom? direct authority there?  assume parent. official vehicle uniform standing near parents. feel like coming school season going HUGE turning point fight COVID-19. I'm hoping best, things go one would expect...it's going good :(  Arizona get free test results come back 2-10 days depending goes checked. pay $300 expedite test you. Remember, nothing reach people money. us government trying kill evicted anywhere get results. stop there. Separate planet infected. Name Earf Too. best part sent survey us parents. results came back 48% us wanted hybrid. majority. already decided results came wanted full open. Lot us upset guess matter. obviously option virtual, even ask us point? sure. Oh damn. That‚Äôs rough holiday. Mine friends birthday. ended last 3 days alone (I insisted went instead sitting dark lol) Herd immunity reached NYC Agitate system helps working class. No, obviously won‚Äôt work though. shame us experimenting entire generation children. Every week new information comes regarding long term serious effects virus could so-called minor cases. wish Florida would get clue. Teachers go back next Wednesday county. people employed businesses would laid would even slower economic recovery people find new jobs ORRRRR... always suspected student... kids really smarter staff. ;P Virtual learning threat administrators public school systems.  much resistance embracing new method teaching eventually impact school systems run staffed funded. really think would waited 2 weeks give guy chance interview found someone else suited needs first? Eh Albertans reddit aren‚Äôt ones pieces shit. You‚Äôll probably get people agreeing province jam packed brick-brained assholes making things worse everyone. kind mask it? goggles kind eye protection? 

It's sort luck draw airplane whether somebody infectious seated near you. people could fly protection fine got lucky. place odds getting infected.

Generally best window known exposure get tested eight days exposure.

I'm sorry loss grandma. Hope family ok. American no, canada united politically letting guys asked Angela Rasmussen apparently even don‚Äôt vaccine don‚Äôt need forever. argument over. know many people went Ivy League schools. Some, yeah they‚Äôre rich AF. aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù level wealth still worry resumes. Boring. Lazy. Poor effort. Fucking yaaaaaaawn also creates false sense security things getting better they're not. offices gearing phase people back buildings, schools opening soon. United States Russia /s wouldn‚Äôt routinely even covid? It‚Äôs gross think people‚Äôs hygiene habits might sitting gross persons seat hasn‚Äôt cleaned. One reason never fly commercial avoided. General aviation all! part look forward lines haha RT-lamp maybe Protests...but ones disagree with. Pushed further. surgery prove opening schools dangerous kids. Dude no. Brazil lump states. going say New Zealand? Canada? Even Spain Italy got shit together relatively fast. 

The states like watching match get dropped onto bale hay launched dry corn field leads forest. Everyone wants shit Cuomo options let die street. Hospitals refused take them, family take them, federal aid came way late make difference. retrospect maybe sending die street would right move it‚Äôs easy say looking back it‚Äôs easy say weren‚Äôt one begging ambulance take resident, refuse drive away. Yeah happened anti maskers got armed started protest, right also stupidest movement ever seen. Wearing masks gives protection virus privacy, facial tech cant even track mask. course not. 

Schools *might* able reopen strong safety protocols areas extremely low community transmission. 

This opinion. That‚Äôs terrifying part eating out! things people don‚Äôt think till wonky experience. Climate change food go hand hand it‚Äôs dream house massive green house plan. Oh no, guess let‚Äôs close schools give free money.

Besides dollar crashes uneducated billy make good door gunner end resort military force maintain ability gather resources keep people sitting home comfortable. Shouldn‚Äôt problem, already oxygen masks plane anyone starts lose lung function. Georgian, Caucus mountain kind, confirm schools getting hit bad.

A High school 15 minutes away already close within first week starting three cases Covid. remember told might make sense need compliance, agreement management training. still kind make shudder. one? Really? muh rights, muh guns way thinking here. totally absurd.  City Schools, Blount County Schools Oak Ridge Schools started last week extra safety precautions, districts already reported positive COVID-19 cases.  district individual plans, three districts using staggered City Schools students began returning school July 30.  next day, student Coulter Grove Intermediate School tested positive virus. Monday, district said first grade class two weeks virtual learning staff member tested positive COVID-19.  
  Blount County, individual Carpenters Elementary School tested positive virus, according screenshot email school's principal. Two different people sent email Knox News.   
  July 28, Oak Ridge Schools announced staff member Jefferson Middle School tested positive COVID-19. Oak Ridge Schools began welcoming students back school next day, middle school students started two days case announced, originally planned.  Bruce Borchers told families weekend staff member Oak Ridge High School tested positive virus. school cleaned students came back Monday.   City Schools, first area reopen, reported additional four positive COVID-19 cases July 31, according parent received voicemail Middle School reported individual tested positive previous week, two days new school year.  
  state previously said plans provide public data coronavirus cases deaths schools. said communication would left individual school districts. Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Bill Lee said state working plan publicly share COVID-19 data. got mine next day. negative. think depends live. 2020: WOUNDED! wear shoes. Might help bit. facebook warriors taking proof go party Fauci Gates lying get chance microchip us.

*Tweeted Iphone registered SS#, DOB security question mothers maiden name home address* kid sits lobby colors I‚Äôm working... 
Find manager work :) Tennessee one worst states infection rates right now? really important question one don‚Äôt know much about. It‚Äôs clear sequelae (downstream effects infection) caused damage tissues actually infected, it‚Äôs consequence inflammation aberrant host responses persist infection cleared. exciting area research one really need know about.

\-ALR  work?

If goal quickly increase infections many fold, yes would definitely work Exactly. want put together slideshow faces people lose, state state play everywhere. dont resources. They're desensitizing people stats like human beings. thoughts potentially waning immunity determined decreasing Ab titers. real concern fear mongering? evidence memory lymphocyte function remains long term?

What effect might potential vaccine efficacy? That‚Äôs point. point inevitably spread kids, inevitably spread teachers parents. explain kid they‚Äôre teacher died went school? one blamed schools dumbass many kids already infected passing around. schools even social distancing wearing masks. magic elves... see what's going Spain, according world meter numbers using include positive antibody tests. creeping since early July virtually deaths still. sure government including antibodies. option still risks. know people want hear honestly think might need declare year loss. least fall semester. assume learning disrupted contemplate idea everyone repeat grade. Yeah like said, open till number infected reduced.

In US guess safe places, sure say Florida. done like setting threshold cases school's area, much dorona, keep closed.

ATM climbing here, sucks. use write notes with? big hiccup can't figure student write 10+ lines mathematics using existing hardware.it can't done using existing mouse keyboard. would need kind tablet pen something right?  UBI WHEN? GIVE 2K MONTH MAKE SURE FUCKING CHINESE KIDS KEEP MAKING SHOES! important news know top ranked schools offered online MBAs this, right? might inferior new. absolutely positively way world work. Schools need closed now, remote learning vaccine widely available. Anyone thinks says otherwise fool. brothers test took 11 days. friends test took 1 day. city. idea difference. thing think difference insurance doctors offices. entirely impossible get fast tests. AFC clinics Alabama rapid tests get results little 15 minutes. took test right closing, got finished next day, could see that. jesus, people, closed due threat hurricane WTF happened Ron Paul? Yes is. slow influencer parties would great news. beliefs. got tested July 20th im still waiting results lol Kids fine, nobody arguing point.

The point conveniently ignoring kids go home interact families. kids also interact employees school. risk increased dramatically people, what? kids go school perfectly possible learn home. Makes sense. mean, good new problem. taking two weeks get results people waiting test self isolate usually late anyway. right. Online classes require significantly paperwork production experience; much takes away time reading studying material. supply teacher?

Do Canadians call substitutes, ""supply teachers?"" Theatres starting open week two well. let's hope goes okay along bars music events. whole point **keep** wearing them, trust kids/teenagers keeping whole school time, renders useless happen.

Masks extremely reduce spread **solely keep wearing them**, we've seen case lot scenarios (that people keep straight refuse even put on). report US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) outbreak summer camp Georgia suggests children ‚Äì even asymptomatic cases ‚Äì may play important role community transmission Covid-19.

The CDC several months behind everyone else is. Again. lead people thinking safe, lead re-opening again, cause cases skyrocket.

We're going keep stupid dance every single time threshold counts ""safer"" ""lower cases"" going dangerous. Get yourself. 

Saferia got four years prison planning embezzling US system. 

A danish state employee successfully embezzled 18.633.000 dollars danish government fundings, got **six half years** prison danish system. 

Like, literally, get yourself.

Tell this: someone drives car, pays hospital bill, person responsible? Tell religion bullshit, usually works. begins Paid* paid much tuition, yes. (Loads scholarships) telling people turn around say ""hey mr Harvard professor, teach kid alone one one, pay $300 hour so. still less half dumb ass school cough diploma useful getting first job. like high school GPA... fucking matter more. Georgia resident: governor incompetent majority citizens conservative idiots. yet followers believe he's got control. means got school.  think also depends whether class intended virtual not. US isn‚Äôt even remotely shut point.  many would sue getting Coronavirus campus classes? used lockdown skeptics argue throw door open, that's exactly wrong conclusion. herd immunity threshold likely lower pure exponential growth, nobody knows much. cost us 160K dead get 7.5% according CDC's current IFR estimate. Let's generous excess deaths call around 10%. takeaway still plenty headroom kill alot people handling things incorrectly going forward. COURSE! üò°

What expecting? ü§î

Only idiots repeat thing hopping different outcome. 
Unless change things importantly follow CDC recommendations follow model set first world countries could manage kids school like South Korea, keep exact result. ü§¨ close whole school, classroom. bet kid exposed kids halls playground. fund military education. need military. completely defund nation left govern. cut costs though strategic spending trimming wasteful programs. ATX replying Ontario..  still buildings pay bills

They call make - take loan hope survive (what everyone else do) pay money back assumption corona-virus going last longer semester year sell land/buildings/resources get rid unneeded staff longer use reduce overhead. school forced run camera church services school credit. got complaints nearly every week needed pan entire audience several times service, ‚Äúoffering‚Äù zoom parents kids disruptive. entirely could name shame. 

I got kicked month started zooming head shoulders whoever speaking nowhere else, lol. Managed piss quite people worth it.  I""ve wondering thing. know since kid might asymptomatic problems might get pushed side parents think ahead. That's cool. lot places that. able spend lot money retraining teachers investing online learning programs... unfortunately lot parents need work feel can't online learning. Afaik can't get unemployment school person option, keep income send kids. 

And like sister, many schools getting angry threatening phone calls losing funding choose online learning. offer person learning students still get fed, speech therapy, stuff like that. ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù novelty stories. We‚Äôve got weeks it‚Äôs common it‚Äôs longer newsworthy. hope last test passes. wish Trump would go away. Almost anyone yanked street could handled pandemic better. got results back day testing middle last week. state bordering us 20 minutes away taking 8-10 days get results. surprise literally one... dunning Krueger like? send 300 prisoners Mississippi let deal virus like 150 VT prisoners have. Concentrate effort Burlington, city international travelers, hope mountains, lakes, open country seal rural pop. spells success. still 56 dead 700,000 pop. certainly equaled states--and even surpassed per capita basis. brought couple times possibility exposure coronaviruses (coronavirii?) might help protect Covid 19 people hopeful need high percentage herd immunity help stop it. see conclusion article, one? skimmed it. ELI5 maybe? Agreed total population entire country 5.8¬†million. 

In US prisoners legal labor slaves. private prisons incentivize make products pay almost nothing. month working might able afford snickers bar.

Our legal system absolutely f*cked one really cares ""it's concern wont happen me"" mentality. know could get fast. /r/coronavirus believes must true. Could corona attending first day school.

Would send kids school daycare then? According CDC flu season dangerous students Covid 19. schools / reopening. 

The downside public schools horribly managed places many going screw safety measures. take responsibility; is; go away eventually. true statements. Trump re-election
tour shouting slogans huge rallies throwing rolls paper towels adoring supporters. Well said. meals, feel like could give SNAP benefits directly kids receiving free reduced cost meals. system already place, works well, deployed quickly. So, date. (murricans) managed disproportionately endanger health care professionals, piss educated population, we're sending potential replacements live knife fight. 

But!! time emboldened high school drop outs, given equal time people education make anti covid propaganda arguments, protected known racist groups demonstrate sicking army peaceful protestors color.

My wife hold advanced degrees extremely valued skills research science software development respectfully, looking, intent, countries residence. 

Just like company competes employees country compete citizens means skills. point ignorant masses realize existence heavily subsidised generous people reaching point simply worth here. 

When scorn doctor's, researchers, engineers, politicians. left deficit skill experience, realize that, far late. 

This rant, obviously, stopped charitable contributions volunteer work many people need work.. spit right face without realizing it. Half voting public wanted trump unhappy life, half voted Hilary contain large group people looking strong intent finding better place live.  attend 1 day school, get tested, get results back already? wouldn‚Äôt get tested goes back school? many questions No, fear mongering response one anecdotal account daft. numbers data, go od. Childrens death rate .000003%. plan child ever get sick again? That's realistic, neither cowards choice locking indefinitely.

Fyi... School started yesterday Gwinnett. child get sick going school. flu deadlier children, yet close school flu season.

The holier thou lockdown crowd cowards choice, scared actually make hard decisions. Thank God power sort. LMAO

Good luck, America [USA]I talking brother deaths due covid-19 stated cant trust number thrown out. reasoning several cases counted nothing covid-19, person dying motorcycle crash death certificate said covid-19(he produce source this).

Is true? deaths verified coronavirus? confirm work tech exactly this. swab hands testing takes 4 hours. perfect world prob done 2 definitely within hour. America point big corporations want wheel keep spinning they‚Äôre saying fuck it, get get it. may die that‚Äôs takes keep pockets lined. usually depends school determines tuition fees. know, university state general area, covered different fees. tuition university may couple hundred per credit hour, there's also thousands fees covers libraries, student support services, campus health care (including gym) etc. course, private universities beast. see argument made tuition paid class took, matter method delivery, fees campus services separate refunded. thought process realistically grand scheme things many people dying virus compared entire population. can‚Äôt shut whole world life must go on. People need work make money, kids need get education. True, would lived released diagnosis? noble work.

Enjoy participation trophy. Oh, Canada. wish home native land. They‚Äôll PORE data, Mr. Science. Wonder positive rate. Since testing ah fucked open ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù. ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù can‚Äôt stop shutting down. So, open, get keep funding support everyone, shut soon one case found. business opening public schools pandemic control communities. say parent rising first grader hates Zoom passion lost joy learning. 

Please wear mask. Get friends wear masks. Let‚Äôs make things safe everyone schools also get us place businesses require in-person contact open safely again. Stupid question. supply teacher substitute teacher? I'm U.S. anyone care explain Sweden situation places locked despite lax response? basically reporting around 10 deaths day new cases gone. masks public transit everything open. Probably math class... Yeah that's VA logic. "" I'm VA medical professional I'm immune"" lol Ok, student example discussing suing operational costs tuition? Holy shit frustrates me. There's real plan happens parents knowingly send kids school COVID. People send kids school sick time (which, extent, get). gross enough flu seaon, could serious reprocussions. Whats saying? One death tragedy 1 million statistic. mostly North vs South thing. endemic now, think one virus endemic humans eradicated, effort took decades (smallpox). virus may us forever point, even vaccine. one time professor told buy book, book subject written first-hand experience topic hand expert in. Plus $22. Yes! numbers insanely low point. Tens thousands die driving roads every year. logic nobody drive ever again. Living life involves risk, risks control, risks can‚Äôt control, risks mitigate. People die things do.

‚ÄúLife worth living take risks order live.‚Äù Nah  Heh.  True fact, US government gives away trillions dollars ends billionaires bank accounts whether filters people first not. Trickle economics.  far legality goes ADA allows services denied due disability presence results ‚Äúdirect threat‚Äù health safety others. court would likely rule wearing mask confined environment like airplane direct threat passengers. don‚Äôt show symptoms might able get court agree something like get negative test result right flight prove wearing mask isn‚Äôt direct threat best bet condition requires wear mask feel need travel drive. millionaires!? true victims pandemic. /s donald trumps fault one cheapest $1 billion taxpayer funded R&amp;D get us? Seems high me. professor taught HUGE university, honestly say students take in-class lecture seriously. They're phones, gaming, name it. actually thrive in-class. sit bide time. Without question. There's great solution masks, distancing lockdowns best compromise. still help send collections. 

Fucks credit any, you‚Äôre poor credit er essentially free. is. last one, yes situation definitely affected relationship friends church. lmao, DIVERSITY REASON COVID RESPONSE FAILURE. read article. Also note vaccine efficacy varies greatly equate response get contracting virus. Influenza immunity vaccination fades greatly almost immediately,but certainly 150 days reduction significant. simply don‚Äôt data virus scientist going say people immune forever specific duration. say immune unknown period time. don‚Äôt get extrapolate viruses immunity lasts least certain duration means virus follow suit. Science doesn‚Äôt work like that. forgot woman. Wonder now? think pushed election year Trump thinks schools businesses opening make look good he'll win... things close again, outbreaks happen, etc. August. think betting could fake everything okay three months, win, let burn. think plan thought through. common symptom, common enough kill hundreds thousands year worldwide (and several million severe cases), 10s thousands US, pneumonia asthmatic complications - ""difficulty breathing"" - fact specifically mentioned direct result flu link posted.

To say difficulty breathing/pneumonia symptom flu absurdly wrong. Flu-caused pneumonia one top 10 causes death US. MLB could make bubble wanted to, multi-billion dollar org. simply lack leadership. Masking prevent second wave. guess would whoever said looking mountains evidence masks work. online business I've mostly hold take care 5 year old, time demanding effectively work home. planning stepping kindergarten started, cases started picking figured we'd seeing schools cancelled.

And I'm fine school remote only. sanity left kiddo misses friends. lives stake, dont know long term chronic issues, any, covid may cause. We'll make work. need sell business may, small sacrifice new opportunities future.

I really hope something comes stimulus soon though. Many people able afford life homeschooling instead working. country ready reopens pubs Irish, might time admit ‚Äúproblem‚Äù? March, Florida rolled back social distancing restrictions, ***Karen Friends¬†Beads*** reopened Melbourne, Mendy White posted [a note door saying required inside store. 

The irony store name lost anyone. mean, attendee positive, didn‚Äôt get going school. however spread students keeping child home tested.  travel lot work. 95% time fly Southwest.. let bring lysol chlorox wipes flight. bring wipes alcohol spray. wipe everything best touch face. I've watched crew come clean seats short stop. thorough hurry. point lack effort. leaving middle seats open people still sit behind breathing direction. Several people still use overhead fans circulate germs air. employees still really nice I'm sure frustrated are. world teachers underpaid? Again, ignored everything else accuse idolatry. arguments ad hominem nothing else.

You're Nazi theres difference totalitarian governments Communism fascism, like Du Bois observed traveling Europe. started war invading Poland, communists already invaded many countries Nazis. worse nazi. Italy's capitalism failed. countries public works owned China generate enough tax revenue run them.

And say system would better. case reason shit opening way soon big businesses US government takes bribes left right desperate start bringing money again. damned people harm.

It's combination unfettered capitalism bribery/cronyism government. Trump interest stopping it, actively encourages / enables it. want's people killing wage slave masters soon possible means makes money people distracted getting sick busy working. CDC run Trump/Pence appointees.    Thats covid 19. data 2017 don‚Äôt go church don‚Äôt believe ‚ÄúGod‚Äù (Taps temple) Every transport company regardless coronavirus pandemic. Almost homogeneous county. want remind everyone Trump lost popular vote 3 million people. Appreciate leaving room majority us. What? world PCR test take longer 24 hours?

And fast test advertised virtually antibody antigen based tests PCR.

My point there's reason lab would take longer 24 hours give results unless huge backlog. forgot rest sentence, told people wear masks fear hospitals emergency personal able get any...ie toilet paper. 

It's true, muppet. Femicides rampant there.... parents Peruvian immigrants familiar culture there. Also, health care system although socialized, great. People constantly joke waiting hospital beds true. grandmother example wait whopping two years received knee surgery. uncle coma right actually due COVID ex-Colonel military police force, connections received better care hanging on..... also helps daughter, cousin doctor. think he's seeing reaction Trump want happen many years left viable political power. There's fine line sort dumb obtuse goof trying skim little top treasonous piece dictatorial racist shit. think wants make clear here.  politicians using COVID response political tool instead right thing.  lol wtf not? bubble always best idea making rest season work. However, 1 player sneaks gets disease, likely spread rapidly bubble, hopefully everyone remain smart. wants save lives. taking care 3yo full time job, know something that. lot work. personally, pandemic way would send kid daycare staying home. Okay... sure you‚Äôre trying prove one. Yeah causes blood clots may solely respiratory illness, already knew doesn‚Äôt change anything. curiosity, constitutes symptoms according office's policy pays test? happens cost testing factor?

Is standard held students teachers? know teachers cost school absent demand subs got large draw subs absent sick days, etc... got high. Ah hybrid think that. That's option state well amount cases county rises certain point. schools opening up.... COVID deadly children. depends are. whole thing hadn‚Äôt bungled start might better answers... ‚ÄúPeople break law little regard human life continue break law little regard human life: 11‚Äù He‚Äôs sort boss who‚Äôs underlings can‚Äôt directly contradict ‚Äúgreat ideas‚Äù instead frame everything ‚Äúwhile that‚Äôs really great idea, think wouldn‚Äôt good ...‚Äù. much sleeping? sure did. gonna like YMCA summer camp 4 days later 250 kids  vaccine 50% effective better none all. doesn‚Äôt prevent infected, reduce severity illness allow recover quickly. ‚Äúhe stated student found criticizing school social media could face disciplinary consequences.‚Äù

Seriously f:ck people. Wait minute. telling pausing testing cause pandemic go away? called ""childhood diseases"" kid: Measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox whooping cough. me, mumps worst. got complications developed viral meningitis. I'll never forget weird delirious state extremely high fever - fear. little kid, personally knew kids who'd become deaf due mumps-related meningitis.

Also, spinal tap excruciatingly painful.

The MMR vaccine introduced country one year I'd last three. Oh my. I‚Äôve never embarrassed mess country. poor guy family.
We really don‚Äôt deserve wouldn‚Äôt blame quit long time ago. know two hardest hit countries (Spain Italy) outbreak centered one soccer match Atalanta Valencia. manage things like travel, concessions,masks usage toilet facilities safely easy. impression Christianity old testament treated like zaney stories. new testament bread butter. show country case though.. Trump Land^TM eat shit doctors told cures covid. Lol we're officially back dark ages, science man bad.. NBA players far safer bubble home. Almost us would safer NBA bubble Honestly, see better social distancing hygiene gym (UK) shop. Everyone wipes equipment using it, limit many people allowed in. even removed piece equipment cannot cleaned, ropes, closed changing rooms. Dude, reading? compare Swedish city LOWER population density Oslo, still show multiple times HIGHER death rates. smaller cities going miraculously reverse difference proportionality. Youre flat wrong. Yes, early-hit Western countries rough time. That's happened; sure want hear. dad, waited 2 weeks test results come back even though time 2 tests come back, tested positive tried take time work waiting test already people situation kinda needs make money, asked felt fine come work did. He's around people generally work least probably caught rona job first place. second test came back positive (first negative) entire house finally went quarantine. Mlb: ""we're gonna 'bubble' casinos strip clubs!"" Jesus Christ libtards. Kids can‚Äôt get disease. already said it.

Wait, what‚Äôs that? kid got school? It‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs fault then.

/s thought process?

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly straightforward thing yet they‚Äôre messing up. Don‚Äôt gather, don‚Äôt open, wear masks, stay away people, number drops.  Yikes thought Epic Games _Fortnite_ Unreal Engine fame. Patient confidentiality rules make harder film US one. sincerely think people ""in charge"", whatever position in, gaslighting say "" never thought repercussions"" opening schools.  call BS. towing lines bosses political leaders. That's decisions, like reopen schools, not, need come top-down, political leadership - people downstream worry losing jobs making controversial decisions may err side caution.  pretending know. always say it‚Äôs easier ask forgiveness permission...unfortunately time that. need real leaders schools, good ones already quit :/ Got it. Hurricanes cure covid-19.

Now Trump needs use sharpie draw path next one meanders across 50 sates we're done. say want. Sooner later going undeniable everyone shit real. Sadly that's going mean 1000s upon 1000s dead. vaccine 100% effective given everyone. What's point? prevents hospitalization universe good enough. Like said: Shifting goalposts. Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs way 50%. would state law constitutional federal law would unconstitutional? Federal laws fundamentally unconstitutional, state laws fundamentally constitutional. Went viral say? referring higher grades like high school middle school Downvotes you‚Äôre muppet obviously before. takes 2 days become viable. word like got attended class? opinion? Kid, take hike. Withdrawal fact like saying sex good; want money back. kid's view like this: teacher horrid. would class taught teacher, would learned better experience. Again, kid, there's door; see y'a. anyone think through?

I ask time people two jobs without reliable second parent day care children. keep everything closed forever one ever gets sick anything ever again. What's American English Quelle Surprise? half-assed single year remote learning school sudden going make everyone uneducated. Schools US bad anyways, one year big difference. would people go hospitals can't afford it? kind unsure saying government says safe go back teachers believe also, wish go back, that's them. assume fancy answering multiple questions really know answer them. admire people sacrificed lives aid others. Without sacrifice society today. seem really confused. another article COVID-19 briefing includes 1,265¬†confirmed novel coronavirus cases Madison County¬†as August 5¬†at 10¬†a.m., 30 yesterday's count. 406¬†active cases currently.  ages recent cases ranged three¬†to 92 years old.

Many people lost health insurance...and prescriptions cost money...

If people cur back spending near zero create layoffs...

And, biggest kicker jackholes taking millions crack PPP program

So, fuckit...let people couple months knowing least keep lights people usually associated one 2 political parties. wondering: school would decide close positive test results students, open all?

This answer, think policy perspective helpful one state goes first test waters.  ""The answer questions money."" old vaccines prevent huge numbers children getting sick dying. TF wrong people? man vital information &amp; country's understanding virus, well keeping truth Trump continuously pretends COVID19 sniffles. He's national treasure, monsters. Stop worshipping billionaires.

They give bit wealth away still money possibly spend thousand lifetimes.

Maybe stop worshipping ""generosities"" start questioning system allows accumulations 30m people nation enough food last week. dunno. Ask scientist significant work is, think every one receive Nobel prize.

If tested parents, I'd confident.  He‚Äôs like one famous actor actually works hard helping others opposed writing check sometimes showing hospital Publicity photo op. people ""COVID19 challenges"" involving licking toilets shit. mostly rural Texas county. Local officials decided governor's mandates legally enforceable, safety measures strongly recommended strictly voluntary here.  Last time heard fell dinosaur. Yet are... simply happen. schools opening -- closing within days. Fantasizing in-person schooling waste critical time -- time planning on-line instruction. Statistically speaking using sampling going representative IFR. Why? broad estimates sampling gives better picture true proportion. testing level draw conclusion sample proportion close true population proportion. think research uses sampling estimated ratios. 

I studied one top statisticians country. 

Also entertains IFC analysis specifically says: ‚ÄúIFR is, point time, particularly slippery test analysis used scientific processes. someone came high level analysis work I‚Äôd conduct experiment requires gathering actual data see 95% CI draw conclusion.

Edit: also see many comments say next step conduct testing verify real IFR is. See comments literally talk testing/sampling effective. Question New Yorkers.

What‚Äôs like there? people social distancing back going restaurants riding subways?

How economy there? that's four things! feel looking Dr Ferguson‚Äôs models... possible deny SCIENCE? Education must online VACCINE !! Social Media Influencers prove shit. impossible problem deal with. know many parents kids can't go school going lose jobs homeless. Sucks around theres good solution without someone giving something. areas closed schools see limited flu outbreaks? schools closed, people social distancing, wearing masks may see much flu areas. Hy shit I've Corinth. fact higher surprising. can't imagine anyone wearing mask taking shit seriously. YES! exactly. 5 hour blocks time trapped one spot soul draining! getting every hour so, something different, allows mind break. productive home last positive laid job loved due Covid! don‚Äôt sacrifice children plan get set online learning schools open. May get evicted tho unemployment benefits ending, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs big deal pandemic,  Yep! Healthy adults *not* risk covid. Remember, you‚Äôve gotta listen science, panic sensationalized headlines. teachers/parents/grandparents morbidity, elderly, otherwise high risk category quarantined protected. children people attending class online, *not* school. Damn. Ouch one hurt right here. huge meme know, one quotes uses ""The U.S., accounts less 5% world population, leads countries global coronavirus infections deaths. nation represents 22% global coronavirus deaths 25% infections Wednesday, according Johns Hopkins University data."" could see someone would say that. 

The U.S handling poorly, that's fact. number hugely skewed many many reasons. example, large portions planet's population reside countries testing well/often/on large scale reside country clearly lying actual amount cases have/had. China large example (Covid death rate like least 1% every country I've seen, yet ""official"" reports show much lower rate, barely infected individuals.) 

Doesn't mean U.S handling shittly, means numbers bad handling skewed fairly significantly. Would great true  opening anything good idea many unknowns besides extremely contagious. make COvid Task force head?
Let Trump golf 2-3 weeks? anyways paying it. Dr Ferguson models absolutely correct... need lockdown hard fast (Australia, Spain China EXAMPLES) Rofl well least got guinea pigs. Wow americans really fucking braindead Something wrong. one NYC hoods wearing masks socially distancing. least hiding covers works- many news stories seen people getting attacked monsters hiding covers?   little less Queens, still overwhelming majority people.

In immortal words Elle Woods, ""What, like hard?""  know follow. Drink disinfectant stick uv lights ass guy. Well heard NY setting barrier around checking anyone goes through, coming state high cases, must quarantine 2 weeks. lockdown again, highly doubt it'll go like first time. No, rich winning, everything going plan them. u survive AZ AC? I'm Florida whenever hurricane knocks power out. feel like I'm dying. Take shot every ""cHiNa bAdDdD"" comment submitted post 3%? talking Montana now? could support making ""soft"" requirement similar example registering selective service. best analogy but... Close enough. think people want vaccine proven safe effective. need ""require"" things people willingly.  die people continue enjoying churches, bars strip clubs freely?? Don‚Äôt understand exponential virus ?? I'm HAPPY district (MD, USA) smart enough foresee inevitable opening schools least Jan 31st believe. know end Jan anyway. asses situation make another decision. 

I relieved would refuse send kids school, turn could send jail, kids taken CPS (child protective services) placed foster care oldest son who's almost 14 special needs, that's truly ideal! knows else care children's health!! least option sending kid school continue distance learning. 

I personally think schools open period! government's literal fucking job take care US!! take care every person country!! Shit happens we're called Greatest Country earth (at least ignorant population America) yet Gov't continually screwed us over.  Please petition government start immigration program American refugees. insignificant number us would like jump ship. happy undergo 14 day quarantine arrive. (Longer even!) Upvoted good way explain it. Although believe there‚Äôs potential secondary spread outlier contact, entirely agree statement then. 

Shitty thing parents families kids returning day one HONESTLY believe that. really think knows. care. kindergarten teacher, want say thank this! lot also environmental 0 deaths 0 cases?! posted last week seem find Omg! big city intelligent leaders! 

They right idea. categorically false. Multiple studies done demonstrating efficacy masks, even simple surgical cloth masks, preventing spread viruses. showed masks effective protecting others wearer, increased protection wearer well. research clear far find, exactly zero studies ever shown masks increase risk getting virus (or virus). show opposite. course, mountains empirical data supporting well last months. It‚Äôs politically convenient blame president rampant spread virus US, reality coordinated campaign flagrant conscious lying every public health official. 160,000 dead end sight

""point indisputable proof please""

seriously? There's reason move accounting science-based organization (CDC) political one (HHS). Unless trying politicize hide something.. also move accounting firm maybe supported election. matters virus politicized, therefore even decisions regarding lockdowns, masks, coming back work politicized. I‚Äôm stating organization doing.  Yeah! That‚Äôs it‚Äôs done! Omg! big city intelligent leaders! 

They right idea. wish downvoted top-level comment thread would help see stupid compare disease terrorist attack, I'm holding breath. Maybe get put bumper sticker. would hardly label NYCs leadership competent. know mean . land blind one-eyed man king . Ahhh, gotcha. restaurants open indoor dining az. gyms reopening. Oh guess COVID isn‚Äôt serious then. Even worse thousands college students whose parents can't afford shell half take debt nearly wealth. someone explain upvoted? Person gets coronavirus?


The IFR children flu higher COVID-19. 166 children US died flu last year. think figure children 14 dying COVID-19 YTD 42 something.


Obviously avoided would better, can't see front page news. There's also argument potential educational loss (particularly lower income students engaged parents, technology tutors) outweighs COVID risk children.

Given IFR 1000s times higher elderly, far relevant story would 'pensioner tests positive coronavirus...' country great whatsoever. mindless propaganda. fairly obvious amount deaths would regardless president. Even putting smallest amount thought tell that. I've seen people say lied working. Apparently, learn new information virus contradicted originally knew it, that's lying. God kind stories break heart. horrible thing obituary actually effect ignorant fucking dumbasses there. covid death could literally doorstep (as parent, grandparent etc) they'd still come insane mental gymnastics blame ridiculous conspiracy theory. honestly shame virus refined irony sensor Did... say that? considered children could spread teacher, parents, grandparents? wait, that‚Äôs stupid ‚Äúteenager‚Äù talk again... bought daughter 39.99 drawing tablet Amazon I'm amazed well works.
Its like little flat pad plugs USB draw stylus pen. Beyond need gather inside due cold, what‚Äôs fucked folks still massive holiday traveling, exacerbate spread even more. Doubtful states close borders holiday travel powerful. Places cold see folks traveling south (spread spread spread). retail stores open (it‚Äôs Christmas!), projecting false sense normalcy exacerbate spread. Etc etc etc

I hope make winter actually. wildfires West Northwest (or massive blackouts order preemptively stop them), which, I‚Äôm afraid, exacerbate spread also. True, seen handled pandemic, make think we'll handle vaccines better? Florida numbers dropped, btw. Two counties accounting significant portion cases. cases also happened path hurricane. Dade county reporting thousands new cases every day. reported hundred past days. It‚Äôll even week so, that‚Äôs dip Florida happened. exactly kids school online year. don‚Äôt know single person it, I‚Äôm trying let first. BIGGEST WINNINGEST numbers! AMERICA 1 believe government honest?  70-80k cases day 1000-2000 deaths, averaging 50k cases 1200 deaths.  That‚Äôs exponential growth works.  nothing, numbers don‚Äôt go down. new thing reporting administration instead CDC Ok thanks, friend. understanding well. think facts alone enough reason ditch rushed reopening schools. like sick experiment I'm really hard time psychologically. cruel, like slap face keep hearing children dying too, top developing entirely new disease processes real idea treat. need societal change over.

have read article? never cities time people inside aren‚Äôt. Schools reopening full capacity people partying. It‚Äôll catch also think teachers themselves. live Indiana, favors either. live new york I'm working again. can't help think inevitable I'm going get covid. dont work can't lay bills so.... mean, it‚Äôs America problem, whole world post-modern.
In Canada we‚Äôve little trouble planning ahead taking actions set us better future covid... lower quality tests (I want say catch like 70% positives something) believe get back results day. catches significant viral loads, lesser infection may get false negative. thought used rapid testing - think every couple days instead weekly - colleges schools catch potential superspreaders quickly. someone wait week results, that‚Äôs whole week may infecting others. Sometimes accuracy goal, sometimes speed efficiency goal. Depends context think Canada pretty ball reporting. way capacity testing, people Canada afraid go hospital need to. ""Which important end superfluous unemployment benefits encouraging man animals value lives lives fellow cattle making money!""

- many politicians right who? OSHA give shit, neither state regulatory bodies. Thank kindly! you‚Äôre raising selfish society learn society indeed selfish *pikachuface* high risk environment like plane, absolutely need eye protection well mask. I‚Äôd go far say, wear N95, Safety Googles FaceShield. American, also thought went back early September leaving early June

I guess lot changed past 5 years Pensions? Pretty sure concerned affording actually live able keep good head. Teachers already paid shit wages want show let family starve lose home? They're better saving lives Florida, better cooking books. can't speak Yale, switch online required lot work traditional classroom professor. sure hell deserve refund, opinion. exception professor read slides Zoom. case, worked ass make online version course engaging enlightening required least 4 times time accomplish that. 

Moreover, like transcript going note online course credit hours worth less. may misunderstand don‚Äôt think conflicting said; agree. think really two issues:

1. can‚Äôt justify current tuition costs online only. Costs way high you‚Äôre getting campus experience accommodations 

2. Forcing everyone online period increase popularity value there. cheaper option increase demand, expensive extra frills option decline demand. 

The means colleges won‚Äôt able justify continue ridiculous tuition costs. also lead shrinking industry lot people make living higher education forced look new profession. this, long list reasons, I'll never fly Southwest again.

Are airlines actually care customers anymore? would need n95 everyone stop aerosol transmission high density indoor areas, like schools. schools allow take courses year two avoid deregistration. know Yale's specific policy. fuck going announce that?? told Trumper stepdad Herman's cancer came back something fierce. Herman knew die, big deal take care himself. Evidently cancer really killed him. 

I personally believe this. know got story, would wager heard small red woodland creature. I'm academically ignorant this, bunch info came think spread surfaces really quite low, close 0%? Also, flying worried easily wipe seat? I'm one 'if scared stay home!' kind guys, saying really think article much value. government handling rather poorly. most, could direct drink plenty water, stay hydrated. also breathing techniques could done, likelihood nothing make difference. 

If get pulse oximeter shows O2 saturation &lt; 90-93% need get hospital ASAP. possible delay might beds available time passed, soon gets serious (or symptoms become better 10 days) might worth getting checked.

Good luck. Sadly, true. Lol They've deluded thinking germ theory disease apply children. Err hate guy. Misleading topic. article clearly states risks running money late September new rescue deal approved, ‚Äúis also seeking protection chapter 15 US bankruptcy code.‚Äù filed bankruptcy protection. I've buying Everclear/ClearSprings liquor store substitute isopropyl. 95% pure alcohol price here. Would say fuck lets get parents sick can't work ...who cares parents die? cares kill grandparents. Except would put federal government - currently led Trump gang - sole charge said national strategy.

Have Americans learned nothing? :( school usually start til end August. birthday almost always first days School stay home play day. GF lives near small beach go there, there's many people there. think outside activities okay long stay hell away people. We're like 20+ feet people least, go stores use masks hand sanitizer like crazy. possible semi-normal life long safe cautious it. ""It is""

In words, bad. Saint Patrick's day?

Late article. people want hear though. want attack ""rich kid schools"". friend go Princeton free (her parents HS teachers). point out, elite schools operate need blind admissions basis make sure anyone accepted afford it. Antibacterial anti viral- look anything surfactants it, destroys outer lipid envelope virus. Cant wait China bootleg start selling foochi. Well that's worrisome slightly optimistic time. Odds I'd probably recover (should contract thing get fatigue)... potentially long road. im gonna say 6.5 million september 1st comes little know virus present. understand cavalier attitude many Americans carry relatively low death rate. Sure, might kill even close understanding long term damage doing. certainly fates worse death, especially we're sending kids back school. setting life chronic pain? Chronic breathing issues? one knows.  


The Covid situation US confirmed deeply held fear mine: Americans severe empathy problem. issue root many things. James Baldwin spoke ""moral monsters"". hired though probably turned lights. still staff members working university still hearing cooling. small university losing dorm revenue lower tuition won‚Äôt offset slightly lower utility bill. end faculty staff make largest portion universities cost. 

The last thing save money lay-off employees. I‚Äôm saying schools large endowments need that. I‚Äôm talking tuition dependent schools. It‚Äôs scary time right now. ""If get corona, get corona"" paraphrase Bill Barr‚Äôs sleazy yet accurate note, depends who‚Äôs writing history. 

(Also, one group anti-education around, doesn‚Äôt matter happened history isn‚Äôt actually, know, *taught*.) never able get gig worker unemployment .. fucked months ... I‚Äôm bad way actually asked friends money .. never done life ...

They‚Äôre working meanwhile industry dead Labor Day always marker first day school state. required law. legislature changed law recently (but COVID-19).

My district scheduled start Labor Day first time year. Since then, start date pushed back well Labor Day - virtual.

Starting school early person brain dead stupid. Must water Mass transit always filthy. Around half country lacks common sense, probably even different decision makers H1N1. certainly play factor non involved federal presence. Nah he's young. He's talk moment cos he's young hot, covid-19 response pretty well handled, AFAIK. Southwest still keeps middle seats empty. felt fine traveling Southwest spacing....some airports tougher stay distanced though... tropical island frozen wasteland would outcome handling tiny trickle tourists... fear shortage. 

Unless hard evidence asymptomatic people spread it, make health decisions based that, unless supply shortage tell people hope adapt lifestyle forever, yes problem. That‚Äôs one listens versus Fauci who‚Äôs well trusted positive doesn‚Äôt promise. first week shut-in

It seems attack people 55. people 70

more kids dying now. understand thing mutating different strains virus. flu every year changes strain patterns. CoVid19 B, C etc? going classified? 

will likely gone June (most people freaking could last till june).  August now.  new spike. hell damn thing?? sports sports marketing. equipment repair replacement. Etc. Etc. Etc. goes on. Everyone currently holidays outside big urban areas. two weeks new school year starts return congestion public transport people holiday leave. give two weeks that, start September, judge stable sustainable pattern. Yeah country dropped ball contact tracing. launched app days ago trace automatically via Bluetooth, requires infected app, too, self-indenting app diagnosed covid. teachers walk classroom reopened public school officially become part problem get zero sympathy bites ass worried pensions preventing suffering deaths others including students families.  also sends wrong message children terms respecting trusting science come solutions problems pandemics essentially going create new generation anti-intellectuals. reported there, one recent article L.A. Times friend mine contact tracing laughed articles knows they're missing outright reporting work place outbreaks. Somehow, cases country originating teen parties, went headlines. True contact tracing would show lot lines transmission, that's impossible U.S., guess, LA Times article reported, employers cooperating employees scared lose job. fucking maniacs. Imagine pay University. 
Message brought Nordic gang whole thread turned awesome whole thread turned awesome defiance. ""just flu""/low death rate mentality. 

Couple information going around false positives, tests actually even swabbed sent prove point came back positive. want possible disruption lives/the business. We've instructed avoid getting tested possible asked, working home last weeks prior said tests. We've several supposed quarantining is. students go campus? regular reminder took us 30 years go invention measles vaccine near elimination Whether test school starts matter...it's still going disaster. Even everyone tests negative beforehand, happens someone catches outside school setting brings in? lot parents going keep kids home exhibit mild symptoms kids always sick. It'll easy justify ""oh, probably cold."" imagine lot kids' parents risk averted type, I'm sure many taking proper precautions day day life. know lot Broadway designers ... podcast days ... super sad This. like trash care ego kids. Like pregnant lady reddit recently bragging careful whole time worrying parents take seriously all. says she'll let move in, justifies anyone asks why. Like wtf? Must nice able say ‚Äúthey‚Äù referring U.S. Go thread - literally asked ""in opinion"". used exact words. asked clarification fit something previously said. 

Good lord - everybody wants read everything like attacks arguments. read every comment worst possible interpretation. Yeah agree this. I‚Äôm totally okay definitely contingent people intentionally trying misinform people two ways. One saying everything fine anything want right virus fake.

Also, please explain opinion think Trumps failing‚Äôs regarding virus are? Aside giving people money, $600/wk top state benefits already pretty generous. also position masks, multiple heath organizations put wrong idea heads start. zoom instead? contrary.

Eating healthy (mostly plant-based, low sugar) diet boosts immune system. measures stop someone getting virus (and experts predict even masks etc stop us getting eventually, may never vaccine) - *but lower severity sickness many people, reduce hospitalizations save lives*.

Moreover, telling people stay home leading increased sendentarism, worse diets, increased fatness therefore greater risk severe suffering people eventually almost inevitably exposed virus.

Moreover, add basic message masks distancing, ""And please, staying home, also try eat healthy, exercise, sleep well supplement vitamin 1000 IU/day order stay healthy"" - downside! downloaded it, virus...

They showed spike 7-Day running average cases, deaths stayed down.

**i.e.**

for dumbass Thank perspective. gonna say Covid positive people people 'self quarantined' due 'self reporting' exposure Coronavirus. always gonna certain percentage people use system benefit. system says 'self report' ""exposure"" Coronavirus stay home still get paid will. Maybe someone check 'self reporters' make sure quarantining everyone households required 14 days. families leave houses time lose pay entire quarantine time(and starts caught). Probably would lot less 'self reporting' cases exposure. It‚Äôs inhuman people wrote elderly. Look effort they‚Äôre putting mark social distancing spots, thoughtless idiots ignore them.

Florida announced last week shutting testing sites due storm, acknowledged cases down. anyone brain figure numbers are. things start kicking it‚Äôll go back up, stay roughly same. 

So no, go history books one worst cover ups aren‚Äôt covering anything up. 200 pretty average country. wedding also doesn‚Äôt cost much there, still really expensive though especially relation average income.  someone faith people even realize disrespectful comments us? I'm California worse every southern state.

Except that's simply true go cases/deaths percentage population. would choose 500k dead vs staying indoors proper shutdown ""You can't that."" feels tome like majority people see care. small minority still seems think big deal probably fine long run. Saved mocked. Oh man! virus seems taking seriously enough. We‚Äôve tried dumb alive. pandemic natural disaster kill kills.

Masks, lockdowns, social distancing, etc might security theater???

Maybe people suspect soon??

Gotta put possibility.  lot hope winter looks like next two months going shit low child mortality rate still means children dying Covid. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs sad? Overall things cautiously optimistic. nice return normal get back work. biggest difference lack foreign tourists. tourism industry held *adequately* Kiwis holidaying domestically instead.

Local Covid-19 news often short statement whenever New Zealand citizen returning overseas tested positive 14-day stay hotel used managed isolation facility. becomes big news someone attempts escape one hotels.

Canada says ‚Äúhold ~~beer~~ Labatt watch this‚Äù opens bars.

ftfy Arizona testing less less last weeks. 15-20k, they're half that. biggest reason cases testing down. evidence stability even reduction. ER presentations reduced.

I'm kidding say could lead 50% country catching virus 2021. seldom kid die COVID ever medication?

Because, cute wedding fantasy may be, spending upwards $20,000 one party extremely questionable decision, matter much fun party is. RIP!

Look, I'm saying exactly this: 

It's worth time figure things like this, make SAFE option work best can. worth time arguing figure jam many kids schools possible, trying sell people safe. That's reopening plans are: like reading propaganda. cute drawings kids masks smiling, nowhere single one mentioned obvious, substantial health risks kids, teachers general community kids buildings. hospitals full. could learn hierarchy proof studies. It‚Äôs sad people get believe it‚Äôs real. doctor two patients. One overdosing heroin kinda stupid. help one them.. help? Flattening curve Damn, could never date someone careless preventable deaths permanent disfigurement others. sounds like fundamental difference morality belief science me. Especially since know talking even matter, shows even really value thoughts. Yep. Never right since swine flu. Neuropathy, tiredness depression. *flips rotates map around* Plus worry depression anxiety make things worse. heart valve repaired last year, ""brain fog"" lasted month....I asked doc talked said ""you depressed...very common heart surgery"". couple sessions cognitive therapy 80% brain fog gone. rest rest went away another weeks. 
People spent last months reading every possible problem convinced brain-damaged invalids even get mild case....it would surprise large number people suffering effects depressed, magnifying symptoms. get america please? every post browse find people saying ""iNmuNItY mAy lAsT twO mOntHS"" think way. country 4 million people around 50ish daily cases April enacted strict measures people obeyed worked. Everyone wearing masks time, streets empty reduced daily cases 0 Juna. measures popular party charge elections huge landslide.


But people stopped giving fuck. Late June/early July 100+ cases still around 25-50 people tired care anymore. Workers stores wearing masks irregularly quarter customers do.



I think best expect masks terrible argument. qualifies question OP huh? Bet don‚Äôt even sound argument behind questioning him. think okay ignore red lights too? drive drunk? going upset someone care gets killed someone ran red light cuz ""I ain't gonna listen gobment tell do""?  think I've enough ""winning"" one year Don‚Äôt post nonsense like here, don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre going die? every post browse find people saying ""iNmuNItY mAy lAsT twO mOntS"" need forgive student loans ASAP. talking SPED, totally different discussion, needs handled differently. 

And nobody arguing rather classroom. ENTIRE WORLD inferior right now, again, parents say ""send kids back schools"", selfishly recklessly trying make lives ""normal"" again. active pandemic, things need adjusted. can't drop kids school say ""you figure out, care to. Oh yeah, make sure get sick"" hear ya. Good point. Juuup bit late lol [It's Herman Cain's party saying CVS told 6-10 days. ended going local urgent care clinic instead. Got results one day.

humanity also lifespan avg \~40, massive wars etc. humanity like past future look like that. see fallacy here? sound data long lasting immunity plenty anecdotes reinfection.

Not suggesting take claims seriously sub toxic anyone values mental health, nothing sensationalised negativity day every day confusing ""scientific value"" ""being conclusive"". Science process. first learn effect, bigger studies measure size certainty. parts valuable. Jesus i'm tired people regurgitating talking points. Dozens countries taken care citizens pandemic they're much better it. political, especially money print trillions give mismanaged corporations like Boeing. justifying preventable deaths. grateful family okay. know hard grasp, people work hard best have. boat. disabled bad immune system. get infections go bad quick easily 1 year. Every time ""friends' family ramble hoax , anti mask, flu,etc feel like saying fuck life. happened 4 years ago getting EBV/Mononucleosis/Glandular Fever. trouble driving work remembering kids birthdays slew brain fog stuff. Post viral fatigue joke... I'm still issues today it. know, maybe vaccine also prevents words scientific value close zero

You send CV Lancet, they'd glad someone intellect working editorial team. Axe kind response wish US done. Hell, Trump actually responded well pandemic, would probably secured re-election.

Instead screwed country somehow made masks political issue. Amazon occasionally isopropyl alcohol stock.

Bought 4 liters 99% ~$36. Expensive enough sanitizer long time. virus new trendy would share ""stay home"" likes shares. virus longer 'cool' they're showing true hypocritical colors. many things :) lmaoo exact reaction. Quick google says :

""Canned soup often lots sodium, cause high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, heart failure"" Hi work SWA. Yes, still are. lmaoo exact reaction. Quick google says :

""Canned soup often lots sodium, cause high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, heart failure"" like Gondor sending aid Minas Tirith bane humanity orc That's wrong mask Yeah, I'm lower rungs danger zone due age, I'm willing give upsocializing relaxed forever. Life risks, I'll manage them, going festival, dinner friends...that stuff life itself. remember cold used say people hey kissing goodbye would reply hey care come here.. Whitehouse strategy:

""Just deal it, nothing else matters except Nov2020."" Yeah, right. deaths per 100000 population, percentage. think general point still stands though. says second link posted ""During H1N1pandemic (April 15, 2009 October 2, 2010), 358 pediatric deaths reported CDC. far pandemic, deaths children less last five flu seasons, 64."" That‚Äôs big number, care net lost here. Maybe Disney didn‚Äôt pay $2 billion wages utilities shut parks. flew New York Milan, month ago. Medical work reasons.

Once rejoined family, spent two weeks quarantine that, symptoms, finally hug them. is. everything. seems severe lack brain matter lot people there.

Supply likely ramping fast possible. governments citizens decrease demand. Boo. Fucking. Hoo! 
I loath anything Disney. shity company. Subsidies relatively short lockdown. Stimulus works. going post ask going fine people might put mask future zero-strike policy. :P sort statements fuel hate dismiss people's fundamental bodily rights . funny make smart. 

There countries world actually forced sterilizations citizens. better future. memory, statistics myalgic encephalitis / chronic fatigue show great recovery rate. people often recall triggering viral illness 10 years ago ongoing symptoms. think apt say depend take care yourself. Blind assumption someone else hour need extremely risky, even problem really want help physically can't (or would introduce problems/dangers nothing). mom 93, saying wants see regardless risk.

 Quality life social life actually means something health.  set March wedding insurance cover us incase things taken care then(though media reports look like medical success stories). First need leader national level. Going less eating like crap less, going less cocktails every meal sitting bar four hours day, going less buying blow. 

*yes people drink home yes, going anyway. they‚Äôve cut going part drinking 50 -60 percent. Maybe it‚Äôs schools closed. Agreed. Remember shit show H1N1 vaccine? ü§î  Southern states listening never will. wear darn masks people. political debate. showing selfish care lives minor convenience. Forced sterilization anyone Dumb enough go cruise right What? 2 new cases immediately AFL allowed attendance went 50K 10K case. South Australia sure abused land grab gentrification

/s caning thing?

i wondering hell ""can"" someone... 


it took whole lot longer care admit.  there's free vaccine every Walgreens, might decide fly again. philosophizing taking evening walk. would world let's say 10-20% population newfound heart/lung/brain problems? mmmm. sure statement here. antivax country ? shit. Well I'm sure comparing Nordic countries really works either. example, oil gas production Norway accounts 20% economy. I'm pretty sure Sweden oil gas production. straight away there's huge difference I'm sure many many more. guess we'll find couple months. Hopefully death sentence. brother's coworker's wife tested positive. coworker work home awaiting test results. brother told work normal health dept. contact contact need quarantine according them. coworker tests positive, bro quarantine. bit shocked definitely keeping distance. Georgian here. It‚Äôs terrifying. can‚Äôt even blame Georgia‚Äôs situation stupid point. reopen schools puts teachers high risk. lot teachers 50 health risks. happens schools get covid19 ?

Some redesign UK schools function needed first. e.g. instead moving children class room class room lesson. keep class room. removes increased risk infection everyone's walking crowded corridors. Victoria *rapidly* becoming complete shitshow terms virus... strange hitting hard has, capital cities Australia (touch wood) still reasonably well.

It's like Victorians ""dumber"" rest country - running wild looking good all. well established adults effected children. Two different rumors: 1) family tested waiting results 2) kid went school came home ‚Äúfelt sick‚Äù parents went test pediatrician. 

Believe want Georgia resident, none surprises anymore. Lol no, one adjudicated case. absolutely insane. I'm homeless fix shit quick sub focusing outliers young die virus freak out. realize 3500 people die drowning USA year ban pools Followed rolling quarantine shutdowns. better Traders know companies developing vaccines getting money Gov't. public knowledge. invest news comes hope going good news. predict final news cause novavax moderna skyrocket. Even though stock went up, go higher release news phase 3 completion ready distribute. stocks novel way vaccine news timeline, know going news future probably good news. person learning better class small anyways.

Time rethink classroom sizes imo. worked hospitality, confirm. Also leftover shampoo might used clean shower...if product used all. I‚Äôve heard lot people saying unemployment lockdown kill, think point. However, here‚Äôs side coin starting find out. really question? It‚Äôs bad school became babysitter designed economy everyone working much possible people raising children. shitty system exposed. internet tools properly school home, truth economy, health children families. want part it. issue government initially encouraged people take holidays ""safer"" destinations Europe based travel corridors... ended kicking countries safe list cases rose. want economy back normal blame people go ahead behave normally. possible transmit antibodies? apologies that‚Äôs stupid question. Busy. disheartened see co-workers apathetic dismissive virus. comes Covid, friends family like NPCs devs forgot update. dialogue options aren‚Äôt.  Paralyzation. Can't even answer simple question instead goes insult. Typical Time amputate legs knees down! stop wascally COVID! can't look numbers way! - Trump Yeah, that's thinking. every person kid came contact quarantine along every teacher too. see schools cyber within month two. one vaccine determined safe humans question doesn‚Äôt exactly make sense. late summer?? title misleading us? LIAR! schools arent paying quality, paying prestige.

You *are* paying quality though. understand idea Ivy's offer great courses great learning environments. do. That's say private state schools offer great things well. also do. there's weird fascination internet pretending Ivy League Schools great they're like local state college. That's simply true. They're great learning environments massive resources student success (support staff, libraries, aides, course designers...). Awesome. live 10 miles Sixes. Guess time close shutters lock doors. Texas, striking currently illegal public school employees. penalty breaking law, educators strike teaching certificates Teacher Retirement System (TRS) benefits permanently revoked. worsening economic crisis also fuel pandemic. People lose homes. wind risky shelters. Others move friends family, making tighter quarters virus's spread. people continue lose jobs, continue lose health insurance; many delay getting treatment.

Also - even without pandemic Senate act together gap enhanced unemployment pay - magnitude layoffs probably high enough downturn self-perpetuating. context worsening pandemic withdrawal federal aid, consumer spending going floorboards, lead yet layoffs. Lol totally unhinged. Statistically: MUCH  someone get enough good PPE :( school would decide close positive test results students, open all?

1. could students learn in-person 80% semester, better 0% semester.

2. whole school shuts down.

I proposal here; probably anyone now, one makes sense:

1. Every morning, saliva test every elementary school student (No need stuff something every kid's nose) teacher.
2. group swabs class, rush lab.
3. get results back school day ends.
4. **If** get positive result, send rapid-response team classroom school: students escorted gym outside separate classrooms something like that.
5. test student teacher expensive accurate test.
6. contact tracing positive tests, including free hotel stay anyone awaiting results housemates.
7. enough rapid-response teams deal every case step 4, shut schools.

This pretty rational sane safe way run schools. zero risk, zero risk situation more.

We *want* people acknowledging understanding risks. set system punishes people planning possible failure, get situation everything breaks things go wrong. germ theory *theory* /s even need negative test go back lol, ridiculous state they've kind left schools decide do. I've heard splitting student body 2 3 ways ever portion kids school time others distance learning. Rotations would happen weekly. 

It sounds noble idk, really delaying inevitable?

I wish politicians would take seriously instead use station. population would take seriously did. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* drive Walgreens week got mine back next day Phoenix, AZ ok though. we're going social distance kids ~~6 feet space...~~ (looks classroom size) ...3 feet space!

We this! many places requiring people nasal swabbing? actual test less reliable,or performed incorrectly? turning every school super-spreader hotspot.

The state government ""passing buck"" local county government.

If want understand conservative governors making idiotic decision schools, look media insisting screaming two months packed all-day all-night protests without consistent masking fine governors applying reasoning even younger people even less susceptible getting sick dramatically younger age range got sick last wave.

We may answer pretty soon! effective Ebola able push death rate 75-95% 10% instances bs. kids gong back soon say Depends ya get done? Idk.

Co worker got tested one place. Took 12 days.

Another co worker went different place, times got results 2 days. city, 2 different testing places. Iunno  Majority children minimal symptoms covid19. doubt reopening schools ""detectable"" effect till 2nd week teachers/parents start catching children. late stop 2nd peak.

UK schools policy kids change class rooms every lesson. Maximises risk covid19 spreading crowded corridors children using desks touched 6 classes earlier day. might specialist classes like chemistry. need subjects. UK schools because, ???  Wow, that's blue. I'm judging anyone, I'm feeling pretty judged (""you care""). know fat?

So let's stay away personal attacks focus real health issues. agree many people overweight reasons beyond control. That's issue here, read I've writing, see I'm focusing obesity factor all: even obese person become healthier (yes, without losing weight) exercising every day, eating vegetables, eating less sugar, taking vitamin supplements sleeping better. disagree last statement?

I personally care body image. Every human beautiful me. someone know much 5 practices help them, think deserve know, you? Based what? prospective study found neurological symptoms 55% patients actual changes MRI. Even 20% recovered COVID patients permanent effects negative economic effects huge. Ok Democrat cities states close proximity protestors mostly wearing masks? CHAZ developer people one another.

Both parties butchering this.

Dem cities beckoning people go eat February, go Chinese new year NY, let's turn blind eye Trump every case. Isn‚Äôt one strike? think terms triage. limited resources, want focus effective interventions. best way save lives stop people getting virus (because even healthy people die covid). fail containing get exponential growth, would catastrophic.

also, end, healthy diet/lifestyle personal choice affect others. impose additional risk hospitalisation death poor health lifestyle choices, large affect people. (important caveat - system overwhelmed hospitalisations, death rate everyone goes up. even world noone covid risk factors, virus spreading fast enough would still cause health system overwhelmed)  found interesting. I‚Äôm gonna wearing mask Disneyland anyway virus city there, covid covid. went earlier year pre-covid, perfectly healthy morning developed fever stomach ache later evening (still managed go space mountain though). Turns really bad case flu spread everyone line whoever sat ride me. feel super guilty now. will. Stress smoking. Confused, what‚Äôs point here? things related rather? Here's immediately comes mind. Ten planes going every day parent comment's way expressing absolute number people dying day -- currently 1300, ten planes 130 (with middle seats unoccupied, that's reasonable ballpark number). clear talking death rates, concede maybe clear you.

1. 10/3000 0.0033, chance die given day 10 3000+ planes going day. first thought 99%. right number 99.6%, unless round result, state 100%. 100% make sense, 99.6% still right. Minor point, first thing jumped out.
2. Southwest infinite number planes. fewer 800 Boeing 737's. number works first day. going state absolute number terms survival rate Southwest's fleet, percentages get worse every day. Soon, Southwest crippled chances surviving Southwest 737 dismal -- still losing 10 planes day dozen left.
3. Depending getting data, COVID death rate USA 0.2% 0.4%, survival rate 99.6% 99.8%. 99.6% #1 slightly higher percentage COVID. same, lower.

What abundantly clear, math error value judgment error, survival rate 99% every time anybody gets plane, would DRAMATIC decrease number people flying. would mean 2% people going business trip flying Disneyland back would never make home. people would fly conditions, many. Ah that's helpful! Thank you.  Oh, wow :( read it, seems like Berlin inspired US wrt compliance. hope consequences. Fomite transmission extremely rare virus? Ok like 1,000 people, 10,000 sheep 20 hobbits live it‚Äôs exactly real country compare 3..2..1.. Unleash psychological issue hypochondriac accusations. pretty accurate him. kind shit 'may' involved makes house cards look tame. 

Stalking young women, minority youth killed without door process, laundering money politicians demonetization heavily dog whistling wants disenfranchise Muslims parliament linking CAA NRC. convictions course, rabid BJP supporter starts attacking insulting Hand King could believe it* everyone started opening shit May June, soon finally started seeing progress.

All stick little more.

Instead whole country started opening are. Bang job, America.

Make it. let slide, assisting denial, textbook symptom. held accountable early life, maybe would accepted would show life. everyone let things slide, gave pass, let take time work, etc. consequences never severe, never took diagnosis seriously. 

 experiences, tough love approach. need kicked ass world times resist mental illness trick into: really need see doctor, medication, stigma attached you. ANYTHING stigma attached you.

 I'm side. side, little bit harsh. nice going motivate participate treatment. going need that, illness inside head, using mind her. mind knows sky blue, grass green, tell stop treatment wants to. 
  
 let people mental illness get away shit behavior, there's nothing mind argue disease. disease head day every day life. everyone's gone they're alone, still there. need something huge remind good idea listen mind. Losing job really good reminder. Spending 3 months psych ward, week two, that's motivation go therapy days really want to. participate, show up. participate something happened can't ever let happen again. people let go, that. took her. I've airplanes long coronavirus thing.

Seen many stories never clean anything. click country graph select box 7 day rolling average. click USA click state find 7 day rolling average. 

For example: here's section Florida.   prevent deaths. surprise cats also detect Covid. Unfortunately cats desire tell anyone. flew Delta last week Southwest today. big difference safe felt carrier. 

Delta planes middle seats blocked out, planes smelled like disinfectant boarding, FAs handed everyone wipes refreshments handed plastic bags included hand sanitizer. 

Southwest serving open cups water, strongly suggested leaving middle seats open let travelers wore mask around neck. Canada's app using open source tech Apple/Google use Bluetooth location tracking. church comparable things man, come sub good place news, I‚Äôm sick overly negative, borderline conspiracy nonsense here. Fucks same, celebrate good news once. Branson gets keep billions island. Fuck lot ya! i‚Äôm disgusted work music industry too! I'm video guy. shit suuucckks. 32 billion dollar industry shut first, last reopen. Hopefully gig worker unemployment comes back I'm fuuuucckkeedd lol. good source compares 7 day averages? I've started recording 7 day average every Sunday make decisions interacting others, would like compare info previous weeks. correct trust feds (obviously) BNO‚Äôs numbers come states‚Äô health departments. grant doubted also (again obviously) although ‚Äútechnical‚Äù issues (CA) hurricane (FL) legit reporting issues also. Ultimately though, numbers going ‚Äútrue‚Äù unless testing isn‚Äôt done, that‚Äôs whole worms. Frankly long TX still reporting massive numbers, shouldn‚Äôt worried ‚Äúmassive cover up‚Äù. Paper towels rubbing alcohol simple homemade wipe. course, rubbing alcohol hard find need 100ml bottle put in, work. think complex issue. Imagine scenarios.

1) Current situation, country shut down. bad. People seeing everyone shutting everywhere EXCEPT here. They're going follow suit. exports limited imports. Economy suffer regardless.

2) Everyone employs intermediate strategy closing crowded places (bars, clubs, concerts) requires masks indoors, otherwise leaves society open. Deaths up, astronomical. Economy great industries need bailed out. vast majority stays intact, including imports/exports. People far less freaked out.

Notice economies suffer nearly much 1918 1957 1968. mean 1968 deadly young people COVID, hosted Woodstock. causes people hide virus appears media coverage/consensus. government consensus was, ""this bad take precautions house parties we'll okay,"" economy would likely suffer much people hiding spending money. Dave 81, mostly likely heath issues. sad died. virus less forgiving risk population. can't lock 100% population homes 14 days lot deaths. people 14 days worth food time that's even considering families 4 me. Someone care people hospitals nursing homes. Farmers need work ensure food afterwards...etc.

If willing let untold numbers people die sure, lock people homes. course there's way enforce people staying homes without people patrolling streets dealing people refuse stay inside die. Oh happen March/April Seriously? said please link post find post history. Geez. actually read article says nuns social work (like visiting sick isolated people) one reason many become sick, need money PPE stuff continue work. 

They seem like nice ladies actual good type religious person (helping others, picketing abortion clinics) I‚Äôm sure commenters hate-on them. going ""im dr. *could* be....."" bit could also multiple different things. ever read article obesity before? Almost peer reviewed academic paper tell income race major factor. really need delete thread. It‚Äôs blatant misinformation. u/outlawed_panda said '/s' 2 times.
Tag reply anyone mention ""u/scountbot u/{targetperson}"" anywhere want count many times they've said '/s' ! people keep avoiding main question, omg. Read slowly bud. really shortage, didn‚Äôt tell us make own!? lord you‚Äôre going address stfu. 

That main question? figured important point lying like say. know tell make mask. Maybe know effective yet. trump gave Un validated opinions, two points said didn‚Äôt need, money overkill won‚Äôt next stimulus, guarantee that. 

The money overkill. Cons understand economics. give opinions. kept facts. it‚Äôs people north east traveling State state, idk tell you, they‚Äôre overwhelmingly democratic left leaning though. talk base that.

The reason said especially northeast physically easier go states they're smaller. drive entire length New England without leaving Texas. Sorry, complicated understand? Nothing Democrats. Republicans much worse. stupid ventilators didn‚Äôt even anything. Clearly idea ten percent success rate, even gave source ignorant try hard.

I think confused. gave Russia working ventilators Russia gave use ventilators caused fires. saying ventilators general help? even know say level pure stupidity. already levy fines like riding without ticket, nothing new regard. old people? ages affected. u/scountbot u/outlawed_panda He‚Äôs worse, he‚Äôs owner, see below. find vaccine work testing it, throw away everything instead research implement modifications? That's American mean, online learning homeschooling option? take risk necessary? Besides year school going screw kids permanently educationally wise? 

I dont facts data, i'm legitimately wondering. know homeschooling online classes always option, also potentially less efficient, can, rather consigning potential deaths cost pay.

I also guarantee family victims way consider worth sense word

Edit: looks like i'm side fence, agree schools far beyond something like home depot priority opening back up, case case depending bad location specifically is. 

This whole situation fucked, get saying, certain point turn stats sit well. 100%. diagnosed 17 years ago. ruled long list things given diagnosis. Advice given wait see time might get better. not. coming entitled jerk used people telling correct company. 

Please stop relating vaccine development software development, thing. I‚Äôve done time working restaurants high school college. would gross told things I‚Äôve witnessed. guarantee almost every cook restaurant wearing mask. wearing one, it‚Äôs chin. yet see cook visible dining area wearing mask cooking required state. would increase capability fighting &amp; beating disease, no? ‚Äúsome‚Äù negligible? wearing masks, &amp; keeping distant, course. prevent deaths, couldn‚Äôt also promote healthy lifestyle? Well there's also lot slavery, know US, Mississippi still getting that. agree things outside carry small risk. socializing important, especially living alone. didn‚Äôt three year old isn‚Äôt 100% wearing mask still touches everything about, would definitely bit adventurous outside. cruise ship?!?! certain luxuries people go without right replace something less risky. less 7 million people Tennessee. 1000 people party small, insignificant fraction state population. Yes. maybe they'll finally realize driving (a 2 ton death machine) haha weird adorable time Wishful thinking best. much individual except ready worst. Nah change turn Think places run Catholic Church like business franchises. lose money go go under; can‚Äôt petition bosses money whenever need it. 

Not saying it‚Äôs problematic system, nuns probably actually need money. multiple outbreaks bars Berlin, unfortunately 40 people one bars contact traced outbreak left false contact information :/ software, vaccine development. Software developed testing, vaccines not. ask badge/ID insecure. Normally take money spot. They'll give bill go next information pay there. *It's Always Sunny Philadelphia*

... yet, right well appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Yeah called ""asshole patients bosses syndrome."" Yes i'm happy bad unfortunately heading towards that. hope mask recommendation might flatten second wave levels 20-50 cases day. blame us? parents it, coworkers it, matter time till get it. might well get with. Hospitals currently capacity state, congressional representative stated goal be. beds get sick  Took 15 days get results possible exposure. Totally worthless point I‚Äôm okay this. Yes, disgusting people looking hope. recommendations stay safe flying? death family people, normally careful, want fly out. They're emotional hard convince come. 

What stay safe airline felt comfortable flying with? Holy shit don‚Äôt know anything Covid. Sure are. pros cons. That‚Äôs something middle best. new cases day one counted, people symptoms contact people symptoms get tested day one, results come time day 5 30 (as someone said, four weeks, results). 

That makes sense all, right? Let's say 1000 people symptoms infect 10 000 people day 2. show anytime day six 31?

Maybe none matters anymore anyway? I'm US European country know second hand experience tests least within 48 hours. 

Like I'm saying is, cases recorded day one much day minus 30???? could weeks old? counting people suspect infected every day. I'm confused. don‚Äôt think people think read headline headline clearly ‚Äú51 infected‚Äù. obvious extrapolate 700 staff going huge impact service delievery. Lungs limiting factor comes high level tennis. Cardio EVERYTHING. whole game revolves around optimizing cardio managing get second break whenever can. bounce ball serving, thinking, catching breath. is, said, busy. Lazy, bad bot Americans probably would happy **a** strategy People acting like sub-BEST EVER education year two going destroy every kid's chances success life forever.

Pro tip: since pretty much every kid's education going affected least little bit negatively (yes, even rich kids tutors) think it'll probably even rest educations/lives. 

It's like lose capacity learn new things soon graduate high school/college/grad school, etc. might get Covid brain fog definitely die!

And anyone tries shit special education kids kids disabilities special cases. know. one. would much rather lose academic progress go quarantine constantly, risk getting spreading Covid, fearful friends family teachers might get sick. 

Yes, sometimes comes development timing pretty important, especially young learning new skills like reading. end all. 

Hopefully keep progressing this. try damnedest keep regressing. regresses anyway, least he's still alive try catch later. never catches up, that's ok. 

I'd rather alive healthy slightly less reaching full academic potential die lasting health affects virus. want lasting mental health affects knowing responsible getting someone sick causing death. 

In opinion that's lot harder get top reading group class whatever. 

What right bright, happy, HEALTHY little kids love learn kind. conscientious others' safety well-being. gives shit end valedictorians educations set back year two pandemic? 

They're already mature lot adults I've seen recently. I'm going ruin punting powder keg blindly hoping explode literally everything surrounded sparks. I'm scientist working thing. I'd go back normal ffs. certain point recognize pros/cons. Living like forever cursed life, there's end sight would keep avoiding inevitable? supposed to. write !remindme (time here) asnwers comment saying he'll notify time passes experience college classes limited. degree supposed hospitality management. But.... third semester working 60 hours week managing restaurant, dropped out. college classes every bit joke high school classes were, though nothing advanced basic accounting involved degree.

Maybe next time stop pretending health expert. think remdesevir does? wut

Why people still keep bringing herd immunity like possible? Herd immunity strategy work Covid-19. clearly established months ago. Antibodies recovered patients fade several months; get magic lifetime immunity like diseases.  Antibodies produced B cells secreted blood. Y-shaped proteins bind antigen (in case spike protein one proteins N E surface virus). Neutralizing antibodies antibodies bind virus render non-infectious. SARS-CoV-2, usually receptor-binding domain spike protein (the part binds ACE2 allows virus get cell). cells come two basic flavors: CD4 (helper) CD8 (killer).

That's are. confirmed cases go down. becuase testings down. Oh good. fix economy, right? jobs now? America great yet? What's opinion current state research hydxroxycholorquine conjunction supplemental zinc azithromyacin? think media censorship doctors scientists speaking favor compassionate use drug, given track record safety, justified? it‚Äôs Georgia simply don‚Äôt give shit. People never learned anything Goodfellas shows. realize that, unfortunately that's going work unless want deal thousands dead children, losing parents. lost nearly 60% income denied unemployment exactly zero leadership country. We're living punishment now. keep saying too. know end, going kill people waste money trying reopening fail matter weeks? time needed clean plane properly, plane would need taxi'd away gate airport. disrupts air traffic turn profits airport. likely common airlines quick turnarounds. opinion air travel pandemics compatible.

God knows even caught it, allow kid suspect go school? Pure stupidity.  Death would negative impact.   good example terrible public schools are.   People can't decide things worse death. hard figure out. link KN95 masks. provide link N95 masks sale? I'd really, really appreciate it.

The N95s see sale Amazon crazy markups (e.g., $120/box). I'm perfectly happy questioning official data looks well keeping open mind reason data changed was. 

I'd even happier drops cases real deaths go weeks.

So yes implying data manipulation may explanation could considered conspiracy theory guess like administration given much reason trust I'll keep options open. Please tell us done differently? hospital beds staff capacity. supposed do? Give hospital beds elderly tell younger patients go fuck themselves? tough call alternative? Absolutely tragic That's sad heartbreaking parents Im praising Cuomo. said county curb stomping virus. We're upstate NY, local govt shutdown Cuomo gave order.

We population 740,000 people. currently around 40 hospitalizations 6 7 people ICU care. percent positive around 1% (running 7 day average). indoor dining bar restaurants almost 2 months now.

We took losses early on, we've responded well. believe we've lost 285 people total. last weeks, cases decreased.
But 30% social contacts, somewhat inevitable.
It interesting see hold level discipline. guys give way much power president. supposed god emperor controlling. fact people blaming trump blaming local governments telling. county/state acting best faith arent going local forums complaining voting out. Even school decisions supposed state governor, Washington. trump fuck national level limiting international flights/travel back January? Yep. fault states handled virus want reopen.  Citizens usa high risks less quality foods Europeans, big shame government treated nation like this. means nothing honestly. Nj ny missed hell alot cases florida. That's difference comes in. see number hospitilisations. Ny nj fewer confirmed cases farrrrr hospitilations meaning missed hundreds thousands cases assumption autoclave sterilization. understanding hydrogen peroxide vapor less damaging autoclaving. Perhaps merely saying can't wear twice wearing causing damage.   

Although less perfect reused mask better mask?  also less 100 new daily cases nationwide almost 3 months now, often less 50 new cases per day.

I know Denmark smaller country that's still like 10-20√ó less US per capita new cases. sizeable American schools south southwest doubt spreading day 1 going uncontainable spread end first week. Surprising one. could happened? Bless poor heart. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs covid viral thing, think it‚Äôs anti-intellectualism gone viral. It‚Äôs everywhere planet right now. doesn‚Äôt even seem anyone looking vaccine moment. VA, took 19 days get results 4th July. 

I highly recommend finding rapid test available. Labcorp also provides mail-in solution quick turnaround. Areas hit hardest (Florida Arizona) seen significant drops testing past week. 30-40% less tests percent positive. long term ramifications? Delta better enforcing masks spacing passengers. Agreed. fully expect October, April-like lock-down. way kids teens spread this. mean government never let good crisis go waste. You‚Äôd seriously naive think best interests heart.

We‚Äôre double whammied sides. Suppressed real threat virus real threat government. Tbf mask might unnecessary winter pull scarves up. 

Edit: guess applies people get cold witner Okay say childs parents sent possibly sick kid school. 

I dont know people voting me. Covabegone 2nd choice (joke) Unless test changed, one right. 

No one would ever voluntarily stab brain like that. still think limitations least guidance getting tested, getting tested case supposed assumption positive supposed quarantining results come in. speak State South Carolina, counting reported positives. 1,000 new cases reported today, means 1,000 reported positive tests. However could people got sick yesterday got rapid test, people sick 2 weeks ago getting results.  labs backlogged, others. Except one time turned powerhouse EA Sports NCAA Football 8 nattys 10 years. never said together... said connected. make decisions affect boss, programming tells otherwise. ever hear Union?

You know happens programming, gets repeated perpetuated.

That point view exactly problem continues proven incubate propagate idea right home would assume well.

EDIT: arguments sake even cant wrap mind around bigger picture, said subject pandemic prime example sub meta. connection way insinuates positivity... feel like anyone outside reddit absolutely idea? Like can't even leave apartment without feeling like i'm entering war zone since literally every person building refuses wear mask (despite huge dense). Adults can't even it, dorms disaster. like one huge sick joke. lot ""it's hot"" ""it's hard breathe with""  It‚Äôs sad you‚Äôre getting downvoted. Harvard allowing deferrals year reason. wonder ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù dangerously stupid. Idiots=selfish kind anyone.  Boosters considered, immune response robust enough, they'll forgo it. Oxford, example, actually planned single dose, realized booster helped response, opposite scenario.

That person still careful sometimes use vaccines placebo, like mmr, also cause fever. prevent people figuring got vaccine.

We coulve planning proper online curriculum months ago schools opening lot people going get sick schools going close online school going clusterfuck gotta put together last minute again. people blame teachers again. diserve shit. STRIKE Testing 30-40% past week. Arizona. Percent positive stayed fairly level span states. can't find cases look.  Instead back school clothes kids getting free corona. planes flying around US big. Yes that's ALWAYS part striking.

Why would think striking would anything difficult sacrifice fight what's right?

People literally killed police daring strike giving us weekend. thing.

People also killed striking 40 hour work week.

Same strikes end child labor. Test private hospital lab you‚Äôll get results within 48 hours generally. 

Test government/public/free test lots might wait weeks. Even good, swear fox news OAN crap would still believe fake. edit, viewers believe every bit garbage. Tucker carlson joke cult following believes everything says, says confidently. goes shapiro cult personalities. Like research stuff actually say read studies claim prove it, usually bs. sub people vent awful shit they've put year. That's it. Since march every single good news top-voted comment like one responded literally argument ""yes bad thing happens die?"" Perfect hahahaha Plunge collapse. Hilarious.  national testing center. one crazily backed up. places test locally, lines well shorter. feel like that‚Äôs fair assessment agree. I‚Äôd like point said professions (and critical ones) (for better worse) working throughout pandemic. Unless laid off, default non voluntary withdrawal workforce. would consider teaches critical one regardless.  less valuable members society? deaths matter? understand point. Lots people health conditions, important us.   earth get results back fast? I'm re-opening schools, feels strange make good points. people properly social distanced worn masks make actually safer might actually considered sending kids there. also love instead I've created small social group trusted inner circle people see online one select group, person.

And like socialize children risk safety entire family.

eta: getting children properly comply (some young 4) going happen. joke wishful thinking. They're children going perfect rainbow sunshine situation.

And guess leads to, maybe dragons stop hoarding money feel good pay living wages people actually afford take care families needs. 

If absolutely need grocery store workers we're fucked? maybe lucky people make $30.00/hour. obviously job unneeded indispensable job. need them, pay accordingly.  translation first paragraf is

Cringe airlines 10 year ban obtaining liqueur license would also good start. one wants consider also would help current administration communicated clear, science-based discoveries policies consistent timely manner. would go long way establish trust present crisis. 

Instead we're hearing ""china virus"", ""disinfectant, knocks minute, one minute, way something like that, injection"" (but wait said sarcastically!), recently ""it is"". leads one think, okay, still racist, still unscientific, he's either those, pandemic response bored shoulder shrug. friend day 18 waiting results live Nevada. sad NYC better job state. completely pulling number ass hypothetical. think unlikely elementary-level kids share crayons markers one pack 10 every 8 students even decent public schools going spread sickness lot faster normal. thought 5 pretty low generous, honestly.

I hope NYC closer herd immunity not. may be! quit doubling ""proof"" implying nothing legitimate difficult sacrifices New Yorkers made last 5 months. entire pandemic revealing broken systems are. It‚Äôs like episode Office Michael delegates office health insurance Dwight, chooses worst option, promises surprise make end day, despite fact doesn‚Äôt never anything planned, keeps pretending like moment he‚Äôs literally giving drum roll surprise knows fake.

Hours later, FEMA press secretary Lizzie Litzow said statement: ""At last minute able procure test kits private market without evoking [sic] DPA."" Exactly. We‚Äôve lost incalculable amount national pride. Covid exposed selfish, cruel, ignorant, entitled pricks huge portion population is. covid gone we'll see second part harvesting effect. Nursing homes like 6 month median life expectancy. people caught flu would also died I'm sure flu would listed cause death. bugs hospice facilities listing covid cause death people stage 4 cancer. opposite aids deaths counted. feel bad kid, time im thinking februrary every news station would like, ""ONE PERSON GOT BIG ASS CITY MILLION PEOPLE!!!!!! NEXT!!!!111!!1"" much hate say it, feel like norm november  answer magical thinking fine means can't imagine someone love due. hid behind preexisting condition mantra somehow think every one know vaccine, 1 5 Americans do. Pretty sure that‚Äôs happened. news story said sibling positive. probably tested asymptomatic sent school bus awaiting tests. Hmmm.

So saying different states using different types tests different results different response times?

Isnt complaining comment?

That problem could addressed months ago creating nationwide testing apparatus. Like every industrialized nation done.

I wonder could foreseen issue coming up.

At least best, we've world. Cool good. ""Can't virus test..."" everyone sub circa Feb / March 2020 Don‚Äôt harsh yourself. Conversion Celsius Fahrenheit pain ass everyone maybe except chemists immunity rate among public probably pretty high. Gotta love old, ""the terms service subject change"" loophole. left schools closing changing schedules within week opening positive cases.

You left report Ohio spread church family gatherings.

You left high number deaths US yesterday - 1300

That‚Äôs past couple hours.
Was political?

If want stories posted, nothing stopping posting them. wow? really? maybe area NYC I'm in. mostly downtown myself, greenwich village area. go see family. risk infecting effectively 0. sound rude 90% people died already certain conditions and/or 70-80 years old. really worth shutting everything basically impossible bet one wants us stay locked next 1-2 years. 3 months lockdown already much people handle could've seen bunch protests like etc. Life must go on, accept fact virus nowhere near deadly think won't... stay home meanwhile rest people continue lives outside Well, wouldn‚Äôt problem never learned read. he‚Äôs giant ass coronavirus experience definitely also commonly used situation everything could solve decide give shit. I‚Äôm Tuscany honestly say everybody‚Äôs following rules here, result, we‚Äôre ‚Äúgreen‚Äù region entire country right now. instance, yesterday small outdoor festival town everybody wearing masks, even outdoors. waiting food everybody social distancing line ups. don‚Äôt want people get idea Italians aren‚Äôt following rules least Tuscany are. despite criticism 401ks less progressive traditional pensions, kind thing I'll take 401k match day trusting they'll give money time. LOVE hearing people give non-answer answers.

Someone say ""We something Covid deaths.""

And people respond ""But car deaths heart disease deaths? paying attention Covid""

And proper response is, something also. 

The answer ""lots people dying preventable reasons"" ""but also lots people dying preventable reasons well."" complete non-answer amazing many people satisfied them. Um whole point advising people use face coverings infected limit spread virus. people understand yet?  Virtually one wears mask Sweden. seen three people one since started. kids bring home parents numbers spike again. 

Gee, wouldn‚Äôt nice consistent guidelines directives federal government stuff? I'm little late thread I'll give 2 cents.

My wife work full time. kindergartner 3rd grader. can't supervise remote learning day.

MA rates currently low, 300ish day across state. may another peak months. think safe now. state. town.

So kids subpar learning months year vaccine comes out? Restaurants. Bars. Daycares. open. schools? 

Should temp screen? Yes. 
Contact trace? Yes. 
Wear masks. Social distance. Deep cleaning? Yes

So safe, kids school.

If becomes unsafe, kids remote. pretending pandemic never happening first place. big leap there. appeal NYC dead shuttering countless restaurants, broadway closed, rockettes canceled, end sight. Show money! love black people! reason republican governor Kemp pressing return economic normalcy Trump somehow look better going election. need day care educational system get back work, yet way safe, especially Kemp mandating masks. us run extortionists. Fun fact: physical therapy plantar fasciitis exists. However unless explicitly ask doctor podiatrist send it, won't. endured three months useless treatments help podiatrist, asked PT referral get assessed somebody else. physical therapist walking normally hiking 3 weeks. go podiatrist plantar fasciitis ever again. No, take responsibility, is.  GRB looking pretty good right now, least would instant. ‚ÄúThis thing going away,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt go away like things go away.‚Äù

Thankfully like presidency term... mother complaining enough people viewing livestreamed masses, buildings need open in-person services order properly guilt shame people attending. not. actually read would know stances. I'm pretty sure antibody tests consistently showed 10x many people antibodies people confirmed cases, nations actually good testing programs. thought process: 

‚ÄúFuck liberals progressives fucking *science* la-dee-dah ‚Äòwe‚Äôre smart believe objective reality‚Äô bullshit. Doctors virologists don‚Äôt know shit. Daddy Trump said masks social distancing queers, we‚Äôre going open show virus won‚Äôt kill anyone rich enough matter.‚Äù Agreed exactly deserving death penalty. high outbreak places remote. SoCal district trying waiver, seem made progress.

Closing schools probably kill governor's career, admire sticking science.

County sheriffs enforce mask mandate, doubt county numbers go individual cities refusing believe pandemic real. Bars still open heard. really? dare close fucking schools save lifes! Actually Nazi Germany way better real slternative news outlets listening non German radio could get lot jail time. Crazy idea here. lodging schools isolated outside children kept couple weeks tested parents pick up. 

I mean, desperate times... Thanks  key going rapid identification outbreaks proper first-level contact containment/quarantine prevent spreading further.

The big difference Canada actually possible, whereas US, many people already infected COVID-19 possible way that's gonna work. Oxford lurker enters chat pay full fare emergency room. Maybe Mar-a- lago unofficial consulting guys(non vets) dont want answers company work started requiring employees wear masks reason decided meant ok take break even around employees.  Many can't quite comprehend virus give fuck clock not.  One many reasons I'm getting fuck away Walmart. Yes, thinking too. still much learn disease people affected much others. Haha. said ‚Äúthought process‚Äù seem understand talking about. person referencing Maine clearly talking antigen test. automated done site, tend pretty accurate positive results, massive downside produce false negative results.

What person Georgia talking molecular testing. highly accurate, requires swab sent lab, lab technician bunch things sample, look certain conditions. takes time, quite simply cannot magically create lab technicians. two year degree additional training certification. going bottleneck.

Regardless, general pretty stupid compare antigen testing times molecular testing times try blame disparity federal government. think mostly hope denial basically, along lack leadership. financial fear Americans basically getting help part stay home. Southerner checking in. happy y'all! Jealous yes, super happy. Take care  assault even worker get sick. knows. They're gonna try Wuhan government hide like everything's okay see happens? end well. shit, expect! Georgia prime example handle pandemic. Imagine said 1 person. Crucified. districts can't make schools safe faculty staff, surprised teachers strike.

You can't ask teachers get sick want work make schools safe everyone. They'll make shingles vaccine then? What's point opening schools close within first month? nearest hospital 10 icu beds. That‚Äôs released psa March saying help many deaths looks like everyone fuckn forgot Nah ignoring enough really need plan methods actively defend them. example, drunk drivers 'vision' someone who'se spent entire life people following behind cleaning mess. here. Clinical trial drug logistics. job anywhere long good internet connection. executive team pretty much adamant working home antiquated beliefs office, trust working.

It took mandate governor ""allow"" us work home.

Guess what, productivity up, errors still office, costs since nobody office use bathroom electricity. Probably not, I've already graduated career. funny. voluntarily work. zero days whole thing. work quit. don‚Äôt see children ones paying price. means we'll see less cases numbers deaths! everyone upset!? /s go back things precedented? r/unpopularopinion nutshell Dude. know? America best everything. contact tracing already late.

No real, think it... Agreed. believe two negatives make positive. believe would cured. answer question? Yes. law stop spread diseases dors situation X. raise everyone else‚Äôs rate. yes go bankrupt. know therapists provides therapy video conferences. showed parents new exercises activities. usually monthly meetings parents showing showing progress notes. Parents supposed activities home help children master maintain skills. Omg spoil saying.

Your comment made seem like accept consequences decision fly, in, stupid so, expect? (Not sure thats meant it, thats read me. Yay text tone voice, right?)

When unfortunately situation simple - sometimes people required work, feed kids. risk take willingly, one may able change without risking families.

I think trying say situation quite simple black white, hope provides clarity see. times totally shocking me. suppose result USA's obsession getting test numbers up. results coming 7 days test would surely totally pointless??

By point would gone infection process either died died, stayed home, getting test result pointless infected anyone, stay home, test result pointless already infectious? Shut shit down, dammit youre gonna shit ton orphans running around...... positive test result 24 hour incubation period? Kinda fast show symptoms it?  people blind what‚Äôs happening world. Literally 99% survival rate almost half cases asymptomatic. one give shit swine flu, corona end humanity ??? ‚ÄúMy subject really complicated‚Äù said virtually every specialist every academic subject is. think nuclear physicists, heart surgeons, psychiatrists don‚Äôt say thing?

This people specialty maintain exclusiveness club. case Ron Swanson proven otherwise It‚Äôs like America walked bathroom skirt tucked undies - everything exposed certainly isn‚Äôt pretty. massive community spread yet. Doesn‚Äôt take couple days incubate??? nose swab kid straight bus lmao Uhwhaaaaaat?! Thanks proving nobody takes sub seriously. everybody class district leaders' houses. safe open schools precautions, I'm sure would apply houses right? all, school building people go learn stuff. Move students &amp; teachers another building, still technically school ""I said people, 'Slow testing please,' "" followed ""I kid, let tell you, let make clear,""

Thats negligence, thats first degree. 

At point Americans stop making excuses goverment, admit explicitly stated reality US goverment intentionally commiting crimes humanity people I'm teacher upstate NY zero confidence district's administration. point they're stalling planning seem counting Cuomo shut schools even open. open? They'll hide offices behind plastic shields tell us believe us eventually shut down. wow *what suprise* -.- Wait this? Ontario start labour day. ‚ÄúhE‚ÄôlL gEt It‚Äù I've thought more, since mentioned read her, I'd know first big outburst, think important mention didn't. go read her. care. know probably embarrassed lost lot privacy feels super invaded right now, what's gone life really business. may said let slide, mean everyone world right know everything her.

really fun middle pandemic. everyone wearing mask, especially outdoors. I'd say see Astoria like half people wearing proper mask (not chinguard nose out)outdoors. Indoors better, still everyone. 

I think reopening got rolled back anywhere NY yet. remember things getting modified coming effect, indoor dining removed NYC phase four. God fucking damn it. Wonder happens? Maybe virus lighter air tends rise like smoke?  Source? think depends labs that‚Äôs running test, big labs (Quest/LabCorp) might backed up.

It‚Äôs also pretty clear sans specific guidance, people aggregate capable needs done prevent spread restrictions put place. people would behave responsibly wouldn‚Äôt need them. don‚Äôt need government hold hand, I‚Äôm quite well off, others going need support solution isn‚Äôt push back work unsafe environments. another reason dogs best creatures Earth.  guy 3 kids didn‚Äôt think *in-person* interview? think someone else‚Äôs job keep family safe?

Why blame someone else stupid reckless was? Easier guess. probably went private lab. New York offers public sites 2 day turnaround is, though...

last employer told shitty call center job, kidding. ""Living fear"" seems like code ""not faith God"" used religious context imo. Gee, could thunk? Turns dangerous consume outside home, consumer economy fucking melts down! impression people pushing schools open understood lot students teachers gonna get covid gonna die decided acceptable. makes think, really thought could operate get cases?? I‚Äôm truly shock level disillusion removal reality. going brains, ok? I‚Äôm concerned  agree, that's first starting out. bet things change next 30 years. Especially first job undergrad fucken Google 250K+ lol fucken JP Morgan / Goldmansachs. kid already passing tests! great news üôåüèºüôåüèº monster üò≠ happened May shutdowns implemented many states, there's second spike cases shutdowns happened lot places.

Not really. early hotspots--New York, New Jersey, Washington , California--had spike May. rest country combination shutdowns closely packed. country opened rest states spike hotspots cooled down. think case counts going magically start decline without implementing real policies. 

Why not? would make sense relatively small number ""super-spreaders,"" people events. people interact lot people acquire immunity, people abandon trains cars, going see numbers drop. words... believe case count numbers anymore.

You allow possibility disease limits?  way using screens cameras teach manner made classroom disease transmission impossible. Sadly, technology knowledge yet exists. Really really shit ostrich head ground planning gone this. people charge child's education safety completely incompetent long time. Literally sick husband tested 21st get (positive!) result 29th. call get it. claimed they6had trying contact him, but...they hadn't. Dumb...as instructional designer tell you. possible learning objectives outcomes regardless whether instruction online, person, synchronous, asynchronous. courses inferior. things come college like socializing, partying, community colleges taking hit. would think would nearly impossible student win lawsuit stating course inferior modality taught...they sued compensation losing things mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: mention overwhelming evidence online education serves public unprecedented time history. fit narrative American education system produces adults stupid enough create mess, would want send child said system *even liable get infected*? say something them? great news. However, terrified change schools reopen month. 6 months quarantine may wiped within 2 weeks. I'm wondering testing availability too.

Are numbers tests performed going less people seeking test? last 14 days, 290 new cases coronary heart disease reported Norway, 196 cases last week, 37 municipalities.

That automatic translator really struggles name disease.. Thats kind point, going happen bother thought process. Im Canadian, everyones following rules part even ""your sheep trying prevent communal contagion infecting others"". people god damn dumb, thats point. Theres many even matter seems contagious is. One person infect dozens. Well according president 45 want less tests because... know less tests less cases.... ughh 


I fully expect take less testing victory. pretty great found worked well (and safely) together. 29 children (under age 14) already died Covid19 USA, per [CDC ""Effort"" keyword. point decision open close made understanding kids get it, adult teachers, bus drivers, janitors, cafeteria workers would exposed. easily anticipated. opening , getting 1 positive result, closing stupid. Either open deal it, keep closed. got us paid wife possibly came contact someone definitively Corona. like responsible adult, scheduled day get tested, let work know happened, said would quarantine test results.

My place employments reply? ""Well. damage already done. Come anyways."" understand: level stupidity surrounding pandemic astounding. it‚Äôs hard tell sarcasm actual opinions anymore. Trump loses likely sabotage plan deployment vaccine fuck Biden.

I put past *him*, think anyone else government would stand watch happen, especially already know work with, even care about, Trump anymore. baby everyone designated ""BabyToHold"" per state/city? committee working right important issue!
/s  going lot dead parents, too. forget year in? course death sentence. Sure, could said preventative medicine across board. Vaccine pushed hard research money pushed hard profit. issue really isn‚Äôt Covid fur kids. It‚Äôs follows. MIS-C. three kids smaller town never ‚Äúhad‚Äù Covid, family members did. Kid got sick later. Covid Antibodies, infection point, symptoms. Now, antibodies causing immune response serious enough put three hospital, one bring air evac‚Äôd bigger hospital ICU. organs shutting down.

All three better now, families unprepared this. Yes, think would good it. Unfortunately consumers vote dollars

Which wet wipes need legislated existence, hold breath one. hospitalization data reporting changed.

Testing statistics managed states since beginning still are. see lost you. know completely failed convince change whatsoever. dumbass cares ego truth they're trying say change anybody's mind. sides could grow hell stop arguing like children people going bankrupt hungry, would great. it‚Äôs foolish shut everything tiniest chances bad thing could happen. Hole don‚Äôt push hyper fear delusions rest population ""open"" ""close"" binary bullshit. Ask educational researcher. 

There MANY alternatives, require time money. argument there. Leadership failed across board. Cue teacher's protests another year online classes.. Honestly think many Americans attitude we‚Äôve spoiled long. We‚Äôve ‚Äúissues,‚Äù haven‚Äôt anything *seriously* affect lifestyle long time. We‚Äôve seen countless wars viruses rip countries and, sympathetic toward them, doesn‚Äôt affect us much it‚Äôs happening *to* us. We‚Äôve blinded whole ‚Äúthat never happen me‚Äù attitude started believe nothing life-changing ever happen us. deadly virus home we‚Äôre simply acting like it‚Äôs big deal. Unfortunately it‚Äôs going take millions deaths America realize that, hey, maybe *do* issue. Yep, societal problem. schools opening tell angry parents tried. angry parents self-awareness, would pushing social safety net, flexibility work home, enough pay parents don‚Äôt work full time, etc. instead yelling teachers keep schools open pandemic, state country‚Äôs populace. districts return school August despicable care children's personal time fun summer, clearly, safety.

Wednesday Labor day gang rise up. Well yeah, personal stamps 98 dpi black-and-white fax quality certainly proof authenticity... Everything said, 100% hes contflating coronavirus actual fucking terrible diseases beat. like calling ice detention camp concentration camp. purposely denying tragedy fit ur agenda. Makes hard china starts running actual concentration camps. ruined word. Fucking liberals. That's bc politics. Places reopening schools political basis - damn well know kids staff get sick  Yup, normally dont like redditor elitist attitude tends exude posters here, say Corona precautions think pretty well ahead curve still. sure exact age group is.. 6-12 believe.. show carry disease. Apparently US South like start early August end year May? 

I thought something weather apparently gives two equal-length semesters natural break Christmas instead January? value service understated. Hope everything goes well! Anyone surprised? Anyone all..? heard pretty easy kill virus surfaces. label Chlorox wipes referring viruses bacteria. 

This link says 70% alcohol solution kill CV 30 seconds. might depend component wiping solution is. need high tech TTI system control spread.

A 80s-tech system compliant population seems sufficient, well.

If Japanese I'd less concerned faxes low testing numbers. I'm political scientist, think technical term ""rubes"" points valid, tuition raises go hand hand overhead cost raises (increased salary demand higher ed professionals recent years, perpetually increasing costs keep technological demands offer resources students, list goes on).

However, point student paying resources available necessarily used everyone (I think campus career centers good example this, plenty students seldom-if-ever make use this) instead went first place, field-specific education? agree points, especially tuition keeps primary resources running library. that‚Äôs case however, tiered academic hours many schools, pay classes take exponential level? Many schools charge much per credit 18-21 credit range 12-18 range, latter probably 50-60% student spend majority high Ed careers. Wouldn‚Äôt make sense overhead baseline front load cost burden?

Not disagreement, definitely conversation point often discussed. yet death rate higher US's 10x higher neighbors'. see disproves lockdowns work. made decision quit job. heart issues best health pretty sure get covid19 survive.  love working retail spent nearly 25 years worth risking life for.  staying home next 4-5 months.  broke least dead. Really? Mine upstate NY took 4 days, included weekend. imagine Trump pay attention long. Hey Donald - turn write opinion. Lol US never going like Australia though. NE US would still hit hard like happened time Europe's peak. NYC hit virus nearly entire non east Asian world total denial still. happened Italy, Spain, UK happened. Yeah it‚Äôs better nothing Scientific consensus case bunch horseshit used manipulate us. friends healthcare say they‚Äôve people come requesting tests going trip friends next week want make sure they‚Äôre good go. *::insert picture Jackie Chan scratching head::* think necessarily wrong word. I'm sympathetic ""situational irony"" reading Alanis Morrissette valid one. kind ignorant attitude going literally kill people already. Like Jesus Christ, pause goddamn second research see statement like ""if home, working"" truth whatsoever beyond ""it feels true."" pointed administrations 10% positive rate random testing region, we'd thousand positive cases showing day 1, like suddenly understand fucking English going goddamned way. Oop. That's life since 14 conditions. sucks. currently employed, work, even so, risking spread could put others worse financial situation. Case discovery, new cases Hell no. happening. Wonder what's going happen reinfection possible... antibodies last long, herd immunity can't long lasting trying ride out. Vaccines way get kids back school. Cuomo still trying handle NY help states. Meanwhile DeSantis ""hey, sucks. ya do?"" surprise? 

A said expects vaccines 50 percent effective. gonna long time vaccine achieve herd immunity. Likely decade more. 

This marathon sprint. downvoted? Every single person know always trying get gold medal ""parent oppression."" talk anything regarding children without complaining. reserving sympathy single parents, essential workers.

Me too. promise loudest ones rich Karens even work with. really understand thats rude. I'm talking rural states world. Politicians control AT&amp;T thinks population worth running fast internet lines to... There's market would invest that? policy issue economics one. right poor hospitals can't handle it, I'm curious would propose alternative? dont school? whole generation kids buttfuckall year? fully understand expect schools shut down. want look like ""chose"" shut preemptively. 

They're perfectly fine letting people's kids, parents, teachers, staff die...so long gives cover GOP base ""forced"" it. think officially call Swede now. :) hype affect election. 7 billion people planet even covid 99.999999% 6 feet away me. That's science. OK Cartman.

You answer question though. wish details long nurses experiencing evidently long-term symptoms.

Also, read articles long-term health implications Covid-19, want smack people dismiss virus minor problem ""oh-so low mortality rate.""  Yes, observational studies always step one. data gathered get approved structured, purposeful trials. 

Source: sit university's IRB board approving human subject research. minecraft course, stop testing mild cases, case fatality rate spike able keep claiming low death rate. live Atlanta proper (i.e. city metro area burbs) got results back less 48 hours test. shocked honestly, maybe Georgia fucking aspect COVID response up? 

Though assuredly Governor fucking every aspect it. one healthy kid one kid severe health conditions. go separate schools. healthy kid gets sick, kid survive. r/TotallyRelevant cut Medicaid middle pandemic force nursing homes take positive people lead lot deaths? Yep, too. Even though little county adding 100-200 cases day, we're pretending everything fine send kids back school 2 weeks. Trump dumb man‚Äôs idea smart man, poor man‚Äôs idea rich man, weak man‚Äôs idea strong man. true, place really bubble. get trapped thinking carries real world, definitely :/ let guess, kid family fine? Sad, huh?

My favorite far woman saw *wearing* mask pushed around cart two children (also wearing masks), mask pushed chin busily chatting (I think) partner middle crowded grocery store.

What's point wearing gonna around chin mouth constantly open chatting whoever phone?

It comically absurd. get *why* pulled down, so.. bizarre image time. I‚Äôm sure child getting quality education fear virus hanging heads time. Hey, anybody notice coronavirus positive tests fallen 60% Florida last two weeks? hospitalizations 20% peak?

No?

No worries, media get right that. use fax machines documents need stamped personal stamp ensure authenticity. used correspond Japanese companies time fax reliable. acceptable pretend receive fax email easy deny receiving. promising news rest country jump bandwagon. Rooting folks American family  ran Due containment COVID-19 epidemic Wuhan, China, numbers patients COVID-19 decreased late March 2020. new cases reported Wuhan 7 consecutive days March 24 (data National Health Commission People‚Äôs Republic China).15¬†The last patient enrolled study March 27, 2020, next 3 days, able recruit patients recruitment targets. discussion expert committee Institute Blood Transfusion, study terminated sponsor (Chinese Academy Medical Sciences) leading primary investigator April 1, 2020, total 103 patients enrolled. interim preliminary data review prior making decision.  Let help you.

I went Yale. lot classes taught TAs, lot tenured professors care research publishing teaching. 

The thing going prestigious hard-to-get-into university know student feel obliged make shortcomings teachers TAs. sure stellar educators, lot educators leaning prestige factor. prestige factor pumped phenomenal teacher. Teachers really get hired schools best TEACHING. teachers given tenure based primarily that, either. Teaching is, frankly, secondary concern many faculty schools.

The degree representative ability get get thru anyway, representative personal network drive.

Students make difference busting humps way got in. school miles live city Canton / Holly Springs. employees neighborhood restaurants bars wearing masks job. patrons social distancing. sheer arrogance.  used often pre rona thing might sneak bridge bakeries restaurants. I‚Äôm sucker knafeh baklava lmao literally said HEADLINE insinuating kid got going school first day. comprehension issues? honestly dont care kids go back school. Everything theyre telling us bullshit one knows anything concrete virus. first masks didnt work theyre mandatory. LOL get two hour number from? Especially since planes open doors let fresh air result letting anti-intellectualism fester. Well looks like read dam thing. Looks like enough time waste internet reading reddit. Oh must genius rich ass billionaire. 

Maybe learn internet research paper. Looks like know thing life. got.

Look wasted time. Higher ace2 expression actually beneficial covid19. start cascade high blood pressure oxidative stress leading clots inflammation. Well, testing centers tents, wind, get could seen coming? know. Could been....EVERYONE? Oh did? provide quotation? wish politicians would take seriously instead use station.

This one allowed stay position two terms 4 years, that. care position is. literally thing ""career politician"" because, like career, sometimes X get ahead. representative yet represent one office long enough people vote based name alone. want to, body probably shitty don‚Äôt wanna risk it. guess accosted worse literally people murder street whatever. sit ins pretty confrontational too, ignorant know that. I'm embarrassed ashamed country. target daughters directly?  already locked world.  Please stop.

You're right. get want make feel like chances, don't. always outliers? Sure ton, recruiting college also people generally going rise top? middling shitty state school candidate.

I'm VP one largest tech companies world. wasnt trying absolve blame, point people blaming things control upset local governments. shit...any woman could tell viruses spread like crazy schools. Takes months fucking research figure bleeding obvious article says parent's believe died Covid, director Kim Tedford confirmed child dead. article say child either covid died it, parents believed covid, also confirmed dead. Enjoy free endless supply Corona, special time-limited offer! that's right there. parents hate children, lot like admit acknowledge. 

/Classroom teacher can‚Äôt agree more. It‚Äôs pointless even argue people. It‚Äôs going happen, reason doubt science here. would purposely educationally plan hardest, pain-in-the-assyist way everyone 3x fretting work? fuck teachers? Unclear... Could someone show power demolish anything? read whole thing can‚Äôt find provision. unable pay however, credit tanks it, going able find place live, buy car, get approved insurance future (which especially bad since states require auto insurance drive), etc. Either way, uninsured medical payments absolutely crippling people, especially given fact many people financial crisis right now. talking Europe whole yh Zurich London probably expensive looking EU members Dublin may well expensive city Yeah...after state New York royally fucked up. southern states combined even many deaths NY alone... That‚Äôs true undergrad, law school bud said another thread I'll say here. think politicians ones taking vaccines first. need televised needs doctors/scientists tv communicating safe politicians relaying scientists/doctors told them. valid historical reasons minorities fear used guinea pigs government needs work correct that. government needs rebuild trust destroyed. Good ~~News~~ Propaganda   ....wait two weeks U.S. domestic travel bans. place low cases get influx travel places like Florida. Nowhere truly safe. think they‚Äôd miraculously make even couple weeks?

Yes. sarcastic either. people literally stupid enough think repeatedly. quite literally seem incapable foresight critical thought even clear cut patterns. 

These people believe completely wholly proven sciences kinds. would one different? wife one point worked hospital lab got acquired Quest turned absolute shitshow compared hospital ran accurately: shut new scary, re-opened got bored, stayed open alternative deemed expensive. Damn thread trainwreck people confusing undergrad law school Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* discharging admitted, even fully heal yet. look excess death home death indicator possible asymptomatic difficult tell along whatever ailments had. article lite details. must run test point known positive. I'm guessing like people said. Maybe matter making comfortable, giving fluids letting get rest much possible. whole thing tragic upsetting. said. immediately dies sleep (I hope) doctor noticed something else going on. Except don‚Äôt herd immunity yet... Comes free endless supply Corona, special time-limited offer!  They've slowed testing cases. gotten virus control. early days, testing way US (meaning significantly counted cases). News stories Italy recent weeks highlighted extremely low number patients left hospital COVID:

 

Can US say thing? states actively reporting hospitals capacity. US compared EU:

 

You spin things however want, testing reason cases. Sick people getting tested percent positive tests shows enough tests many states. failed compared developing nations citizens deny problem, like you, part reason situation. But, August...? Yes!!! absolutely great news!!!!
I concerned Urumqi, relieved  article saying tested positive, saying parent's say tested positive, big difference. also says 'Kim Tedford confirmed death', say confirmed Covid death, saying little girl confirmed dead.  governor kick rocks. doesn‚Äôt say children‚Äôs safety. gay kid right wing evangelical preaching family decided better spend hope good college education private Christian high school. learned early take shit. could force go make easy them. 

That church hated much. senior year staged walkout took 90% youth group took principal church school school board forced compromise another issue. don‚Äôt like religious bullies, that‚Äôs shaming bullshit. great news.

New York State one highest death rates world - 0.17% population already killed virus.

Serology studies estimate lower bound 0.3% worst case, virus already killed half people kill.

So hardly surprising deaths - virus running people kill. New York committed fighting virus. county I'm in, even planning telling parents student teacher tested positive. There's also option online school instead person. Queens here, went Macy‚Äôs saw 4 elderlies wearing masks properly.  This. life. fact, honestly would mind sharing list employers well, would want hire anyone like that. Literal biological terrorists. Like bird box people made others look whatever turns crazy. Money. got exposed first day already confirmed next day positive? Right... probably first day super shitty someone battling eating disorder. I‚Äôve said million times point still stands. goes work every single day beyond Someone didn‚Äôt read article You‚Äôre making shit up, go ahead post anything saying upvoted... can‚Äôt it‚Äôs BS.

I joined sub January predictions pretty damn accurate, even initial IFR predictions February right money (0.5-1%) Sweden essentially immunity magically disappeared horrific bloodbath. posts r/conservative; reddit's version Facebook. rain, that's liquid chemtrail used mind control illuminati is. majority hospitals empty, plannedemic....i mean pandemic hospitals overflowing still far truth Eh, quieter without 15,000 children, right?  feel man, masks fine, really can't much longer wrong. arrived day departure results, world allowed board? Greedy companies putting others risk. People stupid. one washes hands. Even handed around unshelled nuts. I‚Äôm sure one guy reached hand. Unfortunately people likely say, ""But many deaths ACTUALLY caused covid hospital trying get extra money?"" matter bad thing gets, people seem find way close eyes devastation caused. I‚Äôm glad county staying online january schools policy kids change class rooms every lesson.

That U.S. schools work ""Middle School"" later years teaching becomes specialized around subjects (11/12 year olds up). convenience efficacy teachers single classroom plan/organize/execute lessons in.

However, that's obviously ideal circumstances. *had* re-open schools, obviously makes sense students stay one cohort, one classroom, day, teachers rotate necessary various course subjects. would also make tracing easier since minimizes opportunities untraceable exposure (someone coughing middle hallway).

But mainly we're seeing America districts determined open in-person learning also ones least likely seriously anything half-assed efforts. No, poor. Get grouping correct. health insurance cover medical care, understand there's financial trouble medical care comes shooting victim. Interesting. TIL also called supply teachers hahaha Philippines, still Duterte, pretty scary politically, too. opening universities. daughter slated go end August. Could learned South Korea, chose ignorant instead. good going. Schools like ""we'll wash hands really good ü•∫"" get hit lmao. problem Sweden bunch densely populated cities. Keep going list compare corresponding number rankings. point obvious every reply. Silent spread explanation worse country imposing lockdown. That's best come with? Sure, referring argument people seem making herd immunity means cases. level immunity reduces spread, it‚Äôs pretty obvious NY can‚Äôt pretend like it‚Äôs pre covid days expect see massive increase cases. Evidence? job. People ignoring him. begins... summer camp masks, slept one room. school masks keeping apart. people thought case counts high Memorial Day July 4th, wait tens millions students bring directly homes next weeks/months. Even people wear masks socially distance public letting guard around children inside home. hopefully helpful note: 1-8 week range refers variation lag across *all* jurisdictions. I‚Äôm sure data lag NYC deaths reporting, City pretty strong surveillance system usually turns data quickly (even provisional). up-to-date data cases deaths NYC Health Department website: Worried dentist... :/ Yup. I've actually heard nuts shouting conspiracy theory. 

People lost critical thinking abilities, assuming ever begin with. kids safe home.

It's gonna good ""I told ya so"" people's kids get sick, part experiment. Good taking kids out. go school virtual safe. surely can't take seriously matter time I'll go ""I told so"" half entire subreddit shrugged lockdowns measures new normal rest lives Yes, definitely would depend they've charged before. speak experience colleges, colleges come contact via work. Virginia released state version. 

It's sad can't federal level, would useful back May.  Georgia: hold beer history preserved, pun. Sorry Grandma. one first hit, least information, one highest numbers visitors, highest population density country, lot working them. Maybe could done better, still great achievement. begins forget students rely school food. Schools get little money federal government Congress take away president. People see it‚Äôs massively marked price can‚Äôt adequately weigh value cost life I‚Äôm viewing don‚Äôt. convenient time school... told buy cause dont work. reality save healthcare workers supposedly. Power nothing this. naive, bullshit conspiracy theory. Fauci: I've Never Seen Incompetence Like shit that‚Äôs problem. problem spread everyone around him. didn‚Äôt say didn‚Äôt care. Slightly operative word. really support body hope fight virus back without killing thr process. some, might painfully obvious point nothing done body determine whether survive not. We're still far tried true ""treatment"", everything still clinical trials needing data. Everyone needs accept fact we‚Äôre going exceptional situation, don‚Äôt pandemics every year, hell don‚Äôt even get every decade. Everyone trying hard pretend we‚Äôre going daily lives trying get back normal, we‚Äôre normal, closing ONE MILLION people gone, one million families grief, that‚Äôs lot. takes sacrifice months, it. 

Everyone says school college must, plenty proof one succeed without them. world nowadays focused following line we‚Äôre supposed it‚Äôs done centuries, believe pandemic mix things up, show people don‚Äôt need follow people always done, everyone need lead life ancestor did, go pre school, high school, get degree, find job, work 9/5 24/7, retire, die. There‚Äôs life that. hope everyone finds happiness looking for, also hope everyone stay positive optimistic. Find groove rock world. rushed thanks sharing point time cases outcomes, new cases exponential spread delayed death, new cases always outpace outcomes kid already it. cant test positive hours exposed. get exposed, ask wait days get tested. School tricky situation I'm sure stand. complex issue seems like fear porn me. Decisions made logic days. Sounds like cheeky little quip, really highlights it. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm glad parents Presbyterian; it‚Äôs one chillest faiths. even believe nice form predestination everyone goes heaven, there‚Äôs bullshit trying ‚Äúsave soul‚Äù since I‚Äôm exactly believer. Well said. It‚Äôs NYC. inevitable considering dense city is. Fun afford it. can't... leave little kids unattended home anybody nearby.

Also, schools provide breakfast lunch many students. complex issue. Also Korean, agreed points. weird seeing Americans obsessing freedom rights. Like yeah countries those, also bring get whatever want like baby wow three days! guess now! incumbent majority party federal level took pandemic seriously, really would convince supporters take seriously well. think huge issue people like President refuses acknowledge COVID-19 serious problem, constantly spews misinformation (as scientist researching shit, drives wall, despite views matters). allows supporters regurgitate misinformation continue dismiss pandemic. ""If care much, wipes clean damn seat!""

The American spirit. like it. worse that, sadist. Herman Cain? Trump-loving uncle loves rage Fauci (and Gates Brix). ask why, sputters various conspiracy theories gets even angrier. Seriously, big part population programmed hate. Seriously. Think staying home hard mental health? Wait till figure actual health sold price babysitter. realizing reason grandma dead it'll wonders self worth. Gonna fine. One parents teacher basically message they‚Äôve given ‚Äúwe know we‚Äôre gunna shut first 2 weeks, facing much pressure idiot parents reopen need wait positive cases us able point to‚Äù. 

It doesn‚Äôt make lot sense, (at least local district) reopening go online tell parents ‚Äúwe tried‚Äù. Anyone else see pic Georgia high school Hall room yesterday? saying problem white people. Yep. bubble popped day one. Kurt Angle KNOWS can't beat he's even gonna try. [Here check Live free die! keep pointing folks Week Virology (TWiV). great source information. I'm Astoria, almost blew everyone. sorry little tyke, know sacrifice noble cause antibodies aren‚Äôt required immune, response fight active infection, preventative.

‚ÄúWe much better, much better without locking down, think strange binary approach, either lock let fly, there‚Äôs place middle open economy still avoid kind surges we‚Äôre seeing,‚Äù Fauci said.¬†

Sounds like hasn‚Äôt looked US‚Äô mobility curve. opening linear remember death rate slows learn treat virus.

Flu vaccine developers work tirelessly adapt flu's many strains considering predicting dominant ones year pretty amazing even reach percent do. covid vaccine efficacy researchers would explaining do.... Kid went school. [sometimes even far less bare 100 million infections probably. That's many. Good man. make next quarter good possible, cares happens that

We president literally can't think beyond today's news cycle. dunno NYC march supposed stay summer came back SF. SF well whole time. Bc acted swiftly listen science. Yea slightly wavering nothing like parts. expected. 

Also testing free anyone results 24-72 hours. Urgent care get results 20 minutes

The rest cali, stay away. Ok. Seems reasonable. Ok... Reading latest article unbelievably stupid ignorant people. pull ""shocked Pikachu face"" response one ""facepalm"" responses.

We gonna die. schools teachers refuse return caused open online fall.

Teachers union. Use rally fight person schools. Oh forgot protest whatever want. definitely seen multiple threads people wearing real masks though Decimeters decimated, horror... 

Honestly patronizing way. pandemic happens reach elder age, expect 20 something strangers give shit either. supposed read comment take seriously man. highlights similar conversation today: *It doesn‚Äôt kill kids!

Perhaps begin 50% ultimately new vaccines bring us closer 80 percent. would man moon tier human achievement. help keeping mass school shootings need let anyone die. Vietnam 97 MILLION people single one died due Covid. took least eighth United States 7 months even admit virus real. truly live era misinformation. recollection RI originally intended strict NY looking back news I'm seeing it. looks substantially similar:

_Starting immediately, person coming Rhode Island mode transportation visiting another state non-work-related purpose must self-quarantine 14 Nearly 99% is. One morning, child, went kitchen told mom, ""Mommy bad dream last night house fire."" turned pale admit, ""It dream. Last night *they* came threw molotov cocktails home. That's big burned spot lawn outside bedroom window."" 

I specific ""they"" were. Suffice say I'm surprised (although saddened) Fauci facing.  sad true. I'm trying defend MLB. think setting baseball bubble wise investment collective resources pandemic, yes could feasibly done would involve essentially building city scratch. would ton money I'm sure owners would figure pass cost onto taxpayers. 

The smartest thing season, much love baseball. would furious whole thing there's multi-billion dollar investment getting temporary baseball city running. Good thing Yale meets 100% demonstrated need! students paying sticker price whose parents actually wealthy! Sweden horrible example do. don‚Äôt get many mental gymnastics try claim well. ""More easily schools thought...""

Serious question: ever proven children cannot catch transmit virus children adults? yet see study showing exactly scientific reasoning support idea... idea throwing defenses children (who can't critically think things life-threatening danger)... back schools they'll kids (take masks, disobey authority figures, etc). idea come from? 

Also another serious question: calling covid-19 something totally different children young adults? believe severe (or ""hyper"") inflammation myriad symptoms quoted ""affecting children"" experienced across spectrum different age groups, albeit higher proportion elderly folks dying. Calling symptoms experienced children ""hyper inflammation"" rather calling covid-19 makes absolutely zero fucking sense me. can't add word hyper prefix something pretend hyper failed account it... Useless nomenclature it?

It seems start, even United States number one, already fully developed idea children somehow exempt disgusting horror disease. chose accept even best case scenario's lasting economic trauma, lasting disruption educational services, lasting erosion consumer confidence? 

We need done fucking pretending. Yesterday. Maybe numbers don‚Äôt lie, think countries whose numbers probably lie trump probably going extensive secret service detail former president history. one hope extended adult children, pay security arrangements enabling father past 4 years. taxpayer mind paying protect barron - fault republicans keep sick father office;  say zero deaths? clearly narrative trying push though, byeee. kids unprotected sex. There's planning young on. Throwing money problem work magnitude open gyms! Especially upstate!!   null hypothesis lasts. coronavirus we‚Äôve seen lasted viruses do. exception rule. 

No, portion society decided that, helped along media, power pushed increased power. keep ziplock paper towels soaked cleaner. Voila, wipes adjusted population, useless metric Open eyes there‚Äôs evidence sheesh Let die. That‚Äôs way country change better. virus blessing disguise No, poor work company offices Philippines employees literally *lived* offices month could isolate continue working. Food brought in, met family members outdoor cafeteria, etc.

.... also generally better attitudes time American coworkers did.  kind Lynch. live Louisiana direct network pretty well - people acting responsibly, although length pandemic really starting wear us.

But hey keep wrong side itll probably work day. like incredibly infectious deadly disease magically go away. like donny told you. Even though essentially never told truth Yea talking transmission severity disease First: really impressive promising!

Second: headline highly misleading. going comment ""100% success rate"" unhelpful without discussing false positive rate, saw even introduced line sweat samples, dogs detect positive one line negative ones 100% accuracy.

So given batch samples know *exactly one sample* positive, dogs find positive sample. dogs actually far difficult: sniff single sample decide whether positive, again. researchers even seem *looked* false positives negatives scenario, would ridiculous expect either rate zero headline tries suggest. Yeah it‚Äôs going disappear simultaneously schools open up...or not.

Let alone died it. people can't see something tend take less seriously   keep mind treatments gotten better. timing two flipped, deaths would been.

Goes show problem frontloading deaths like sweden did, also demonstrates trickyness flat comparing numbers, since death rate disease gone Often comparison Influenza. like point 99% people got vaccinated every year, people would die flu. push harder universal strain influenza vaccines, probably never influenza flu season let alone pandemic, ever again. 

I feel like covid like driving. can't help get hit drunk driver. However, wear seatbelt, buy car airbags, drive recklessly, roads slippery. Yeah, die die, take plenty precautions. maybe push cliff instead family Covid deniers really truly denial something like happening. accept pandemic‚Äôs reality think would frighten extent might ever recover. seriously. number tragedies lives point coping mechanism deny angry. normal lives control ability meaningfully discipline adjust pandemic seems basically there.

People bad touching face, adjusting mask, touching objects, touching inside mask removal, washing hands donning doffing mask. makes cringe. reminds Cool Chuck Patriot. one always kills me...just makes rational sense whatsoever. guys know, mask mandates place ages germany. immidiate fine thats new Lolll time machine would make beneficial?  people don‚Äôt food. disgraceful. least city majority protestors wore masks, outdoors. Tulsa rally indoors masks. Nobody large indoor event right let alone president. idea impossible suggestion is? would need army. let ask this: happens someone tells police fuck off? happens someone want comply get fine walks away? think police grab risk injury someone party? police let person go people willing cooperate get punished? Ah see man/woman culture well. suspect would much higher good ole white boy. remember vividly, reputation fellow New Yorkers, really hope keeps word. Hell, school district near person graduations last month. One student, attending, admitted sick. Tested positive virus got everyone else quarantined. 

And happened multiple schools - someone attended sick. 

This trend school district going see. Parents taking sick kids tested sending school Ill. 
I mean, happens normal school year - parents can‚Äôt take time away work use school glorified babysitter. 
I lost track many times nieces sick attended person school - since schools closed - 0. haven‚Äôt sick once. Dick nose. Sweden higher mortality rate USA üòú mean, intend wear mask cold flu season regardless covid. flu sucks. know county Florida school meals continue summer. will, could now. Pity governor blindly follows guy big white house DC. Needed reminded today. call feeling little overheated. fever bleh. work ER around covid day. feeling little bad it‚Äôs important remember post. Wear N95, offers dual protetions. Also always disinfect hands whenever touching face. soon disembark, get rid mask nearest bin, disinfect ur hands again, switch cotton mask.
I also take shower soon arrive sure wash away lingering virus me. good plan, I'd leave there, period There‚Äôs evidence people infected also study a. peer reviewed b. major publication. Yeah think cases gone some, started really week two ago, deaths week two behind that. NY showed, slow decline mountain. really want bring Mississippi‚Äôs history treatment people? Compare excess deaths US lockdown started lifted. Lifted way worse. Well it‚Äôs bad enough close bunch testing sites. wish people also understood it‚Äôs low rung worker. managers ones understaffing everywhere. one actually everything prescribed people given. It‚Äôs sad joke American capitalism. always want rock hard place cut corners won‚Äôt fault. 100% part super shifty. American and...United? Vow revelation maybe, maybe you‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs way three drinks week makes alcoholic. Like Jesus give head shake outbreak work need get tested. CVS says take 6-10 days results. Can't find better options area whcih sucks Funny, country tried introduce student fees argument ""The student becomes customer demand appropriate services."" buy parties trunks cars. Everyone gets hit since trade global governments seem act basic way towards virus. differences thinking necessity restrictions, corpses start undeniably pile up, action eventually taken. Companies people also seem take steps too, way governments escape impact matter choose. economy first -strategy seems theoretical plan, practically impossible actually follow. deflect effects bit, can't avoid getting hit. sheriff‚Äôs deputy there

this bothers most. LEO's following orders disagree. 

Violate constitutional rights? fault.
Wear mask? UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Except local government officials think kids immune social distancing economically sustainable long periods time. Economies collapse would probably end civilization. article say offer sanitizing wipes anyone asks. ask one take care yourself? I'm sure migrants prefer wellfare getting bombed shot home countries closer 2.5-3 times week actually :( Explain, theory stupid?

  
 *looks USA* Recently? graduated 50 years ago got good education. know someone graduated 30 years ago got good education. lately, ""reforms"", teaching test? Critical thinking fallen pretty much table. also depend school district part country. would people go back city right now? Cases could go back time. found Windex disinfecting spray. smells like cat vomit. use dealing raw meat. Otherwise we're using soapy/wet washcloth. I'm convinced follow-up research show vanishingly small number cases respiratory virus spread airline belt buckles. Yes, read study. vaccine reduce disease severity, though, presumably would apply across spectrum disease sequelae.

Also, FYI, influenza also cause viral myocarditis.  electrostatic process kills BACTERIA 

But I‚Äôll say this: wiping surfaces easy part protecting yourself.   live? oh ffs, really eating anybody's bottom line? data. That's I'm saying. see lot people turning higher paying jobs make less money. Let's hope god plan right, little angel needs reach home Well yes, suppose say lifetimes. overall. worst yet come. bother think all. That's difference others, post opions original topic others spend time posting opions opions. could solve problems within year deported every racist redneck though ""Better"" subjective. live pluralistic society one person's better usually expense another (though rich guy, could care less unless affects rest us). ask equivalent itemized bill tuition otherwise really arguing ""it's expensive""?

No wonder many people getting sick. idiots like think know better. Grow fuck up. Wear goggles sealing eye-mask too. Care elaborate? ""junk science""? opinion Yeah, lol! I‚Äôm still waiting 2k people die every day too!  Nothing see hear move along! seems much main stream publicity suspected long term effects. Maybe people heard that, it'd taken seriously. Time finite resource can't buy more, money world. Always pay fine. seems like going devastating thing ever happen humanity

So far! systematic racism? Oh geez. That's scary. Good luck mate, lady NZ, albeit one probably never know dealing with. Well, I'm kind glad canceled trip today next week. still sucks. planning trip since January. Bubonic Plague, Spanish Flu, AIDS ... let's pessimistic.

Lol ""I want happen, fear that's take"" phrase I've say many times far comes pandemic Vampires relax: never get covid breathe also remember large number NFL player end bankrupt. truly isnt much different someone going work grocery store school.

I‚Äôm back things healthy me, you‚Äôre right working home makes much convenient before. Ahh would taken virus seriously.... would mandated masks probably organized national testing strategy... 160k dead now... removed rider, driver I‚Äôm guessing think like you. ‚ÄúThis nightmare hasn‚Äôt even hit final form‚Äù. think certain people still trying evade wearing mask, months lockdowns, political banter, hospitals run, deaths, bodies stored refrigerated trailers. freeze evictions run out? Well, leave imagine, without foresight. Well, understand : question ""are vaccine safe?"", seems, answer obviously no. 

 

Overall, vaccine good thing necessary, benefit much much higher low risk. Howether, 100% safe, crossing road 100% safe. would answered question, howether pro vaccine. Thus, I'm sure say result France antivaxx. comparison, took little launch 2 wars.

Federal government still hindering efforts!!! Haha luciily I‚Äôm own, ball busting facetime. large beard trimmers! Maybe one day I‚Äôll get good them... Ain‚Äôt nobody got time dat!

*taps ventilators* *cough cough cough*

*cough cough cough*  I‚Äôm absolutely still wiping groceries (and everything else comes outside) disinfectant spray. It‚Äôs well know viral germs survive cold environments longer, plastic days hot temperatures, much longer cold temperatures, pop fridge freezer without wiping it, you‚Äôre guaranteeing eventually you‚Äôll bring covid fridge could accidentally expose virus. 

It‚Äôs worth peace mind me, don‚Äôt anxious every time I‚Äôm grabbing something fridge forget wash hands eating it. months distancing gonna scar kids life time. People far worse things anyways one bats eye. freedumbs. though? Living like sucks. ""This predominately Hispanic region cruelly vulnerable COVID-19. prevalence **diabetes** roughly **three times national average**, households among lowest incomes America, adding difficulty thwarting virus.""

This shows differences addressing public health new segment population likely addressed soon. Consider??? think actually time consider. Now's time action. open schools, take rocket scientist fucking comprehend that. ""You're one cursed knowledge"" Pretty much Ontario masks indoors, seen less 1 500 people wearing masks. kind ironic thing say getting tube letting someone else (and maintenance crew) shoot 35,000 feet sky. may screwed still alive healthy.  Stopping spread virus going require full compliance mask use large gatherings public schools.  government going help us need protect means everything limit spread virus even costs us jobs pensions whatever thing somehow important dying. I'm sure probably experience symptoms much worse extent me, they're already describing exactly brain works anxious/depressed person smokes much weed. going one crying get sick kill grandma Good luck. I've self-imposed lockdown since March. time leave house pick groceries every two weeks. live States I'm surrounded idiots care trying mitigate virus. hard living isolation, good luck hope community gets cases. heard FOMO past 8 years...this people stupid. know. :) You‚Äôre right though, bit specific early comment clear. used anecdote strong hypoglycemic episode talked hyperglycemia original comment mentioned. flipped it! Thanks adding clarity. crazy thing virus rampant Texas contact tracing impossible, literally everywhere community. assume EVERYONE infected. 

If wearing mask public, get eventually. read someone defending day saying ""it's popular expression US"". course is, use refer 140k dead, humanity put question People getting tested much week variety reasons (storms, etc). reality number higher low-ball portrayed. I‚Äôve years stopped catching colds/getting sinus infections started. what's explanation 50% reduction number tests performed, even though positivity rates continue quite high? must travel airplane, clean yourself. trust $10/hr cleaner tech best job you. That's assuming timeline significantly longer believed. know anything long term yet. thing full global pandemic status months. Much ahead.

Yeah really felt like one best aggressive responses early stopped decided reopen. Lots kids go hungry without school meals too. Btw realize article Canada spite fellow American‚Äôs aspirations, Canada part America (yet). browns games aren‚Äôt really relevant posting. yeah...this pandemic exposed many loop holes society Even did, going test every day? quarantine anyone came contact someone tested positive? article says 50 people protesting, nothing like massive protests Berlin. Also, based pictures look like druggies alcoholics, probably Feijenoord fans too. Sad expected. Police beat everliving piss them. That's scary.  said wouldn‚Äôt wait 2 weeks? get vaccine 2 weeks up. I‚Äôm going ans you‚Äôre gonna cry something. Lets take notch. Let's say Hillary 150,000 dead Americans watch. would beyond impeachment. would point Crucifixion. No, they‚Äôll start knocking heads demonizing teachers unions again. politicians pushing reopening BS don‚Äôt care teachers students, want schools open working parents don‚Äôt excuse go back jobs.

Really asking covering noses compliance. yes..that's exactly people lose? win both? dont proposition, can't things used social distancing safely.

Sorry hear :( Weather huge deciding factor many schools. hear bantied around. might Ok couple months, beyond places least northern US nasty winter. Wind, snow, raid, sleet, sub zero temperatures.

They think remote education conducive learning. Try wind blowing freezing temperatures. There's reason buildings enclosed heating A/C systems.

For think good idea, think office job then. Put everything outdoors see well goes. That's exactly true. ""works"" everywhere. collect proximity data, store people users spent suffitient time around happens.

So totally download right still benifit, long province going come online coming days.

Atlantic Canada, prairies, BC soon. straggler Quebec. TBD them. don‚Äôt know else tell points listed. can‚Äôt see cheap, accurate, easily scalable, non-invasive, quick testing method good thing I‚Äôm sure why. 

Sure could scammers trick idiots thinking dog could detect Covid could testing methods easily. 

To benefits clearly outweigh negatives. ""They'll get it."" they'll post pictures online gain sympathy unknown strangers. That's true. Sometimes wonder posts like fake. People can't crazy, right? time school start again. Great way keep us locked respect. pizza, tell em' add fresh garlic plus shrimp crab meat step off. Good enough good -- compromise based simpering dishonesty.  think, Germany report. anyone else find weird dog smell this? look good me, I'm mathematician.

Maybe could explain? ""Sorry kid, pass sniff test. go."" Yes that's I'm doing. many people fly work, seek specialized medical care, see family end life, care elderly parents, get new job laid off. I'm sure think many reasons people sometimes travel would often plane. ‚ÄúWhu would leave? We‚Äôve got Walmart, McDonald‚Äôs lake right here.‚Äù We're what, five six months worldwide pandemic people still asking basic questions like ""Should go one worst places possible virus spread roommate positive?"" 

It's like people five six months worldwide epidemic people putting metal cutlery electrical sockets, still asking ""If use knife instead fork stick socket, fine?"" ""Me? Racist? could possibly make think that?""

*I'm literally crying know tears from...* fear losing ""access"", many American journalists allowed become glorified stenographers. like term 'anti-intellectualism"" 

Intellectualism specific connotations necessarily relevant could actually make defeating issue harder. 

It intellectualism follow medical advice courteous either.

I honestly think lack proper education. Especially understand education country directly tied live live going largely impact quality education. Hopefully understand major issue. soon, someone close catch them... then.. athletic healthy. Sometimes opposite true - high-performance athletes sometimes cause bodies lot damage. Healthy means: daily CV exercise (boosts immune system). Supplementing vitamin (boosts immune system, deficiency rectified weeks supplementing). Eating healthy (mostly plant-based, low sugar) diet (boosts immune system). measures stop someone getting virus (and experts predict even masks etc stop us getting eventually, may never vaccine) - lower severity sickness many people, reduce hospitalizations save lives. (And another person pointed out, long term reduce mortality diseases too!) Looks like lot muricans killed china good. else handle death though? 2.8 million people die year US. can't mourn them, reduce death reduce individual suffering turn tools like statistics. Using right tool job make non-compassionate. 

Lives/capita awful way too. running trade offs lives lost different scenarios. save lives easily? yes, it. save lives, cost lives? got decision make. case Florida, think makes sense delay school let cases continue fall. places things control low case numbers, children's education extremely important worth risk. 100x ""essential"" Home Depot open. Hell, sheer amount educational inequality gaps open schools closed are, imo, worth ""some"" deaths. We're talking royally screwing entire generation low income kids. That's big deal. vaccine isnt worth gone hundred them, longer fun Natural selection finest even logic, incomprehensible pseudo navel-gazing novel therefore immune system could even cause cytokine storm healthy

There little evidence COVID-19 patients experience cytokine storms. quick glance IFR populations age 65, without existing comorbidities, shows even happen would *incredibly rare*.

Being young healthy associated *significantly reduced* mortality rate COVID-19. Like, less one hundreth one percent.

So quit fear mongering misinformation.  think understand charity is.  something life 100% perfect.  selfless caring helping others even comes expense whether time money comfort. attitude definition selfishness self absorption. I'm sorry, live ... _Lynch_burg? Okay fuck southwest. I‚Äôm sure big tough freedum loving bikers totally observe social distancing rules wear masks.

Its interesting note lack literacy mostly due large Hispanic non-Eglish-speaking population, i.e. lack education communication rather stupidity. chain strong weakest link. people stupid ignorant issues education system place live failed them. unhelpful turn issue intellect. Turns dating sites become much popular. Can't say much personal contact ... that's catch-22. (BTW...read Catch-22. Heller book.) Funny, parents died, people taking care end.

The idea humans take care essence modern [mention organization would get post banned].  Ha ha , follow joke Catholic priests pedophiles? Yeah that. He's mine. Blue matter who. Winnie Pooh temporary, live that. China killed itself. Give 2 weeks, we'll roll back people saying ""we could never seen coming"" Well sister law is.  Good you, Portugal!

Edit: Let's hope tourists increase amount cases. would shame hard work get's undone inconsiderate ass. mortality Portugal increased ??

 

Excess mortality real index, rest accurate Yes, traveling nurses make shitload, should. went church guy BSN traveled 90% work. made enough support entire family homeschooled kids it. That's concern one doctor told me. that's message must given way suggested - careful imply healthy means need wear mask.

Masks work, young people wearing will, point, fail use properly. inevitable. Someone lift mask scratch lip. Lower mask let nose free. Rip mask someone else's face prank. Trade masks. Students nearly zero enduring discipline. nurses. Neither teachers, also inevitably fuck point.

The school environment one suited kind pandemic control. Any. classrooms specifically designed certain number students, zero room distance students large class sizes. Social distancing cannot followed schools. crammed, disease ridden environment best times. 

This infectious disease outbreak living memory. virus care can't stay home watch kids. virus care kids ""need"" physical classroom. people send kids school, get infected. infect others. exponential outbreak politicans enough spine tell parents *deal* it, like summer. like spring.

Rednecks proud working-class people traditional American roots unique culture. Hicks uneducated country idiots try force hick nonsense everyone else. Hospitalization data goes HHS. know suspicious too, HHS anything number cases deaths. Outstanding idea. get news views society memes. least FB Fox News know creating content.

They cut telecommunication. coworker Wuhan. said family similar experience us Canada locked down. lot family time, fear, odd shortages niche things bizarrely empty streets. still went groceries. asked relative 2 provinces aside locked travelling Wuhan, hermitting fear without much impact.

If blacked communication worry might incinerating town burn infection.

""The spread covid-19 South shows extent anti-intellectualism.""

There go, fixed. prolonged, toxic reaction ""This can't happening......"" not? shows virus deadly helps immunity.

My whole point 1 case 1 death (100% death rate) better 5 million cases 160k deaths (\~3% death rate). lower death rate given number cases great that's worded include California lots mitigation techniques par Florida.

As see graphs provided, California high quite awhile Florida &amp; Texas newly high (and higher deaths per day right California ever per capita absolute). point specifically focused defining ""sky-rocketing"" deaths state chose two drastic recent spikes going happen. Could single count, could back counting, could day two. like 340 deaths per day thing rest year.

True, spikes happen, think state certain 340 deaths per day **won't** thing rest federalism great. Let states/counties handle things way think best.

History one mine. interests might not. People complimentary like that.

I dont find history particularly helpful many cases. often(almost always) arguments futile absurd.

History like bible. People tend take want ignore anything inconvenient.

Bringing history areas particularly relevant ends diluting topic hand, giving much gish gallop about.

Often people say ""you need get education"" actually mean ""you agree me. ask ""ok, jump hoop disagree?"" goalposts move.

Consider talking racism bringing history inevitably brings Dinesh D'Souza.

Congratulations instead one focused topic substance, accidentally kicked 500 irrelevant arguments.

If discussing closure polling places disproportionately impacts certain groups, really want invite drawn well rehearsed argument ""who real racists"" are?

If going discuss abortion, really need argue Margaret Sanger?

When talking social safety net really need argue LBJ?

I dont need go though decades history, poll taxes, jim crowe make argument easier vote, period. Inviting people squabble shit irrelevant allows people endlessly defect.

I see pattern happening again. dismays me.

Its easy say result bad history/not enough history. easy.

Masks get jail free card, make huge, lifesaving difference. reason continue using extended period time. 100% efficacy mean they're useful long term.

Also social distancing wealthy greatly due government providing succificient aid funneling bail money big businesses. nations able lockdown real temporarily protect without wealth everyone could actually shelter place.

I'm curious someone like thinks responsible. Go ahead man It‚Äôs unfortunate people need President tell listening scientists doctors right thing do. 


They need president tell listen scientists doctors. However, really need president keeps planting seeds doubt. still millions people think hoax president said back February March. mentality president get half country wear masks. reason schools reopening little mitigation parents demanding kids wear masks. I'm day 10 waiting results NYC well Lol! ""The popular virus"" üòÜ *could* smart way it.

We *should* group-test school kids frequently surveillance testing; bump front queue get results school day over; isolation procedures positive test.

A headline like this, regime, would sign things working properly: finding isolating outbreaks.

I know that's what's going here. report move on. It‚Äôs time stop giving morons attention. much testing doing? friends got tested, location, different times day. went middle day got results next day. friend went latest got 2 days. friend went first opened got 4 days later. knows. decided quit job find ways support expose morons.  many cases covid19 live less less people wearing masks everyone going back normal lives feeling going getting hit really hard soon likely schools reopen here. oh kidding, ill check thanks tests 100% reliable, know whether dogs 100% accurate?

If China India reacted quickly time around, might well way 50 million dead.

Does look like ""canceled testing altogether""?

You know numerous tools track data, look like ""canceled testing altogether""?

Florida shut state-run testing centers areas path Hurricane Isaias, rightly so. cancel testing altogether. They've reported 400,000+ people tested 7/30-8/3. 30 billion would cover free tuition many many decades come. undergrad class size 6000. need president us use common sense. That's sad blood politicians hands gucci degree metro Atlanta, Cherokee county like 200,000 people it. slammed virus back log. insane. months alter century learn? idea stupid sounds? best solution refund tuition semester let graduate can't put Yale resume. different kinds tests. faster others. proximity testing lab plays part well. *could* be, provide positive example scientists thought. CIA Supervisor: Jesus Fucking Christ. learn, Palmer?

Palmer: know sir.

CIA Supervisor: fucking know either. guess learned again. I'm fucked know did.

Palmer: Yes sir, hard say. Canadian, shitting people seems like widely accepted way life US. [It's pretty straightforward, Hi! feel extremely strongly yell you. Nothing personal, idiot.

My Grandmother several friends died middle worst NY immediate family, even cousins went, let alone friends funerals. even wakes, tiny private services burial site. We're talking like 6 people max. 

It's pandemic, there's vaccine, cure, family want risk lives traveling fucking pressurized disease tubes? I've never heard something selfish, stupidly naive.

Stay asses home fucking deal like did. Stop idea unnecessary travel worth risk, isn't. 

Text, call, talk, mourn home. They're dead, care. care, understand LIFE important DEATH.

I get wanting closure (believe really do), face reality make BEST choice loved one's health, fucking stay fuck home avoid risk.

Get face circumstances stop trying negotiate around it. estimates showed .01% death rate among 18, people like cool! percentage still 15,000 people. love idea. Seriously. much better instruction community college university transferred to. There‚Äôs always chance get great terrible instructor anywhere, theres school that. students took classes uni seemed much worse prepared upper level courses result prerequisites good. Luckily smart folks could figure things out, baffled amount people said, ‚Äúoh yeah used x software class, never taught 1-2 credit primer take quarter before, expected learn that‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand class well‚Äù kind stuff. goes beyond class sizes stuff, whether school/department actually seeks educate students help develop skills. good bad instructors both, make world difference, one system seemed set success clearly Reminds state secretly secure supplies Korea fearing feds would come moment seize  call last point false negative. genetic material present test correctly show negative result. Even present sputum.

And first case false negative would caused bad sampling practises test itself. know something? 

Anyhow, absolutely know cases dropping? question. Less likely symptomatic likely, likely, high viral load despite this. friend mine told girl talking tested positive Corona. got test results showed corona positive. went bars later night. reported loss taste minor symptoms.

Location: WI world thank Georgia canary coalmine. Problem 30% false negative rate. worked fine Denmark reopen schools (with many restrictions place.)

But also waited corona go reopened them.

I surprised went fine, did. isn‚Äôt reason. Despite anti-maskers vocal, fact matter is, USA relatively high mask usage rates compared countries without pre-existing culture mask-wearing, throughout crisis.

You compare countries countries way better far lower mask usage. people certainly aren‚Äôt helping, aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthe reason‚Äù things control US. Yeah, know. November, despite happened year, going important month 2020. Sure fucker  said ""what It""

Not push back quite bit interview. shit dumpster fire. Trumps team thinks good idea interviews?

His base might like it, rest world sees laughs. pay. Las Vegas free tests people get take 3-4 days come in. $120 tests, hand, come back ~12 hours. Businesses wealthier people pay get faster results issues solutions perm death people continually seem losing sight of. work public safety sector. ‚Äúcompany response‚Äù get-go ‚ÄúYou chose profession involves around people control environments also control over‚Äù

While conceptually get that, think happening teachers becoming aware exposed well. 

Functionally spend time situation officers paramedics do. Yep. Viruses change genes expressed bind manipulate cells. could carrier bunch things one day start manifest. Underrated question here... title makes seem like kid contracted covid, got tested found positive within 1 day. microlearning microschools? OH NO. COULD POSSIBLY SEEN COMING. WARNING. GOODNESS. 

^^^^^/s That's fair.

We also like pretend *can't* affect us reasons...like AIDS 80s.

Then get shocked find diseases give half liquid shit religious political beliefs. invented idea children immune can‚Äôt spread, therefore teachers can‚Äôt get somehow is! Wiping performative safety anyways. really doesn‚Äôt prevent infection significant ways. policy stop getting sick flight reliably cancel flights. aren‚Äôt going suppose it‚Äôs better don‚Äôt pretend flights safe couple Clorox wipes  That's bet. K-12 schools make September reverse course. Colleges universities might make bit longer, since students physically class less taking ""wear fucking mask"" seriously. Hi 

There's preliminary links established correlating blood type covid susceptibility, severity. think genetic polymorphisms like fut2 (secretor status) interferon polymorphisms like INFL4 could factor covid disease severity concept ""superspreaders"" 


I'm total layman pet theory back started looking crazy virus: mentioned really seen generic variability spreadability talked ( quite possibly stupid ?)


Also another question, became fascinated compound called pyrvinium, cheap , FDA approved, OTC , list essential meds known safety profile. (again total layman) eyes seems like could possibly beneficial wrt host response, others - wrote brief rationale shown vitro inhibit covid replication (very well) there's focus context SC2 clinical trial, study, anything. Yet things like HCQ paraded months, news, papers even though mechanism action, efficacy dubious, even today still used places.

 I'm curious researchers choose compounds focus on. existing 'unrelated' compounds like stand chance getting explored ? Depends hospital maybe? I‚Äôm NY got tested covid came back negative within 1 hour end closing state-run testing. counties directly path Select state-supported testing sites impacted Hurricane Isaias closed July 30 reopen August Testing sites Charlotte, Escambia, Hillsborough, Lake, Lee, Leon, Manatee, Okaloosa, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk Sarasota remain automatically assume it‚Äôs going disaster? Everything always immediately doom gloom people sub. fuck, could bought lambo pictured tungsten ‚Äòrod god‚Äô piercing bojo‚Äôs dome vaporizing 21 Downing surrounding neighborhood. schools opening 7 end month glossing gravity decision either way. made clear personally think schools open, arrogant assume easy decision make.

As days ago Indiana seeing \~1% positive rate Covid tests. seems huge regards schools, school 500 kids could expect 5 sick students. Indiana also \~2% rate child abuse (source below), twice high national average. school superintendent, mayor, governor decide 10 abuse victims forced stay home risk 5 students coming school without symptoms spreading virus.

I would vote keeping kids home, I'm victim child abuse never deal anything traumatizing that. lose-lose decision whoever make call. Yes virus contagous easy extrapolate even 1 sick student tens dozens sick parents faculty, ignore fact child abuse also lead violence school shootings years later. seem logical keep schools closed? Sure, obvious decision make weight heavily regardless pick? knew r/StarTrek universal translator would end mask? school August? Lol posting beyond... oooOOOOoooo dude, China, amirite!? Ah, see 2020 trying do! making finally feel motivated shit , feel happier BAM, it'll hit corona, allows recover, fucking ruins life following years. second now. Aaany second now... Unfortunately even city Canada think schools going get it. 1 case new case city yesterday asymptomatic carriers still walking around.

For sure teacher going catch it. what? Bring supply teacher? Quarantine whole class? whole cohort?

This whole thing fucked correct topic. transferred UW Madison MIT (majoring Comp Sci) retake classes. first livid MIT accept UW credits, taking classes, understand reason. class (in title course description) covers material different depth. 

In one, understand algorithm use / not. other, also understand algorithm works modify requirement changes little bit. words, also learned write similar algorithm conditions changed. getting fish vs learning fish type thing.

Sure MIT OCW (their course material available freely online) class part that. learn studying OCW site diligently. imagine class resume, employer know right away: guy knows write algorithm. Versus PROVE employer ""I've taken OCW studied skill."" saying employer believe it, makes interview process smoother. USA never good. No. could've. US needed centralized response Coronavirus. Instead, President advocated that. made states, hospitals, testing facilities, etc. fend compete supplies. Trump took seriously focused response it, impact would've minimized. could've isolated first cases. Instead, able spread across country. right quickly losing sympathy teachers mess.  working interests. saw earlier looked like Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine best Well, though? think I'll hold carry me?

 I'm asking question? What's wrong that? misunderstand, teachers going strike, they're going simply leave profession. There's threatening, they're going give up.

The sad thing is, Republicans win either way. school goes on, bunch teachers get sick die. teachers leave, makes public education worse, demonize even push private religious schools/charter schools. long damages public education, win them. virus care. They‚Äôve never given single shit teachers No, weren't.

This whole back school thing make sense me. way early, especially open full capacity. Germany, started late April. grade grade, beginning higher grades (because better understanding hygene routine school). 50/50 teamsplitting schedule. 50% class present one week 50% tasks home, next week vice versa. Classes tought courses still done fully online avoid mixing groups. summer holidays started. we'll see rules school starts again, state end month.

And kids went back school cases much much lower US. think MSNBC biased, feel bad ya son, got 99 problems educating dumb ass validate confirm unbiased journalism ain't one WOULD THOUGHT sacrificed societal hangers-on keep economy going. Brilliant. Fisting alert. resturaunts well takeout others aren't. get it. supposed know whether cases continue trend down? 
 
No, case numbers accurately reflect actual number people infected due fact many cases asymptomatic. know something? good see moving along, know want conclude trials? mean ""as badly before""? Portugal great, comparatively.  go search papers like downvoting, find:

1- Getting shingles chickenpox vaccine possible rare. also hard know vaccine actually cause. Even vaccine cause 100% time, would still rare.

2- There's enough data know everything topic due vaccine available 1995 time takes develop shingles.

3- vaccinated kid get shingles, likely get young adult thirties/forties instead 60s/70s way better terms symptoms risk dying.

Not me. kids. exorbitant tuition costs universities. bloated administrative staff over-hiring. 

This one main reasons hoping Yang would get primaries. idea force universities cut administrative staff back. requirement proposed keep ratio admins student 1-30 want federal aid. 1-50 70s, college education cheap.

Of course, Americans probably want see children die (while others want fuck first).

1. We've reached side curve FL, TX, AZ, probably CA;
2. T-cell memory real means significant portion population fight severe covid;
3. Hospitalized covid patients treated convalescent plasma may death rates reduced 50%;
4. NYC experiencing nearly zero new cases deaths.

These pieces news widely reported. Instead, /r/Coronavirus, hear vast death right around corner, per usual. hear schools must remain closed. hear Sun Belt blew it. hear lockdowns must reimposed.

This bullshit, pure simple. data-driven. narrative driven, bad policy, absolutely political. that's many parts US, esp outside metro areas. unpardonable, whole testing fiasco. ""Smittskyddslagen"" quoting? Easy Monday morning QB thing worries 2-3 members family die. 1 death family bad. 2-3 enormous repercussions.

Near Chicago I'm going say something that's probably going shock you: nurses essential personnel also parents. Millions kids certain age can't ""stay fuck home"" entire nursing shift. hard understand? everyone access unlimited, free, perfectly-sanitized daycare imagining. certainly can't, position privilege cushy, well-paid office job calling shots, something personally need worry about. people.

I'm even saying kids back school, sit fuck down, I'm trying get sub acknowledge middle road ""librulll hoax"" ""StAy fUcK hOmE"" people hurt ignoring existence are, guessed it, poor kids. always always be. Believe HEALS ACT coming somethin like 30billion toward defense. excuse. strike! üò± watch children parents work? Oh wait...

Good luck üòÇ Honestly, thing come schools aren‚Äôt making decision open best interests children. outward appearances they‚Äôre forced open order obtain maintain funding. Tax revenues down, state federal funds directly tied student headcounts physical buildings.

Granted family fortunate we‚Äôre financially stable, careers allow us four children home full-time. Still, I‚Äôd love house hours day. Regardless, zooming analyzing school district‚Äôs stated decision making process, manner they‚Äôre proposing reopening, seems obvious they‚Äôre opening order continue jobs educators administrators, think it‚Äôs safe immediately necessary kids. Fuck Georgia. suck article states 15 patients came ventilators quickly. 15 patients received treatment emergency use authorization. agree, pushing especially seems saving lives people likely make could known would happen??? I‚Äôm sure meant reply me? so, don‚Äôt understand. guy taking temp something else.no mask really standing arm length away lot old vets fucking insane non American, happens loose health care? die backyard get corona then? imagine he's never deal problems himself. Things ""go away."" Efforts people make go away.

Imagine life much privilege narcissism think problems resolve themselves. please explain allocation people field? I‚Äôve taken online classes way better in-person classes. think largely depends professor structure class. Child tested Thursday school started. Parents sent child anyway without knowing results. LAWSUIT! Sue parents? I‚Äôm US. someone live symptoms, tested whole household isolates 14 days, unless test results come back negative. 

School kids mix outside bubble outside school, test positive school within past week, class isolate 14 days. Outside school guidelines mix - it‚Äôs completely back normal. 

The disease isn‚Äôt prevalent US, although it‚Äôs still much here. think we‚Äôve come realisation cannot close everything ever, guarantee vaccine long yet, things start point. 

The risk really teachers family members home. Younger children especially particularly vulnerable Covid-19. real. know subs still live home. like go work accept job (because teaching jobs impossible get Ontario) stay home risk bringing older parents.

Its tough decision everyone. Every test I've seen ga test results 24 hours less. test hospice candidates come home hospital go LTC I'm confused - pitchforks what? missed what's bad  GA grad student here. I‚Äôve told prof work university basically wants (has to) collect charges dorms, meal plans, parking passes, etc. otherwise won‚Äôt make enough sustain. already massive budget cuts university system GA, students learn home, it‚Äôs even bigger hit financially. I‚Äôve heard people couple departments expect us back school face face outbreak occurs, everything moves online.

Edit: extra word Upvote aren‚Äôt surprised..  Interesting, considering source mentioned nothing loss taste smell, medical website. Fauci said hasn‚Äôt seen virus wide range symptoms ""I've never seen anything closely resemble virus spectrum do,"" said, referring wide range symptoms vary individual infected.‚Äù

Can tell he‚Äôs wrong too? You‚Äôre probably lot smarter thinking lot critically Governor Georgia. total waste.

Defund military fund education. definitely hit miss. serious trouble getting focus home, kids home, impossible get much done. end staying like 2 get things done go bed. Cities full ‚Äúleftists‚Äù though, it‚Äôs ok. /s first one third one make sense sound reasonable, second one depends belief system, last one step cliff reality. people meet person, outside, wear masks, socially distance. upcoming anniversary 9/11, Covid-19 taken American lives attacks day, every subsequent Islamic terror attack Americans since then, every American soldier killed action Iraq &amp; Afghanistan combined...several times over. cost roughly much. 6 months.

And yet millions Americans actively fighting side Covid-19 proudly defending voting continue lobby destruction country. literally option. gunna pack kids together, going get CV, they‚Äôre going take home. 

People treating COVID like affect finite number people it‚Äôs almost maxed out. thanks. covers it. I‚Äôm parent maybe I‚Äôm base here, thing worse kid home time work able see weeks time global crisis. 

Conceptually idea makes sense reality don‚Äôt think anyone would go county did. ""distanced learning"". Taught teacher, live  substitute person interaction business world.

Hm, think successful innovators right something little bit different... admins everything power take pay cuts. cut services teacher salary can. Schools supposed face crisis years ago declining enrollment, naturally admins pushed international student enrollment even meant declining academic standards. leadership failed every step crisis

Yep. suffered economic consequences without constraining crisis. worst worlds. economy shitter peopel dying en masse. thinking this, like anything else US, generationally fuzzed up. 

I remember Mark Zuckerberg got caught fingers cookie jar way, ""back day"" decided drop 200 million (100 million directly another 100+million matching donations) school district Newark, NJ. Mayor Corey Booker, Governor Chris Christie Mr. Zuckerberg variety characters, somehow managed spend millions ineffectually.

With 50 million cocking teachers review process, 20-30 million going consultants , admission [ineffectual might EASY point party, basically people hand fuzzing up. 

This shows fairly clearly , microcosm *problems* America's school system they've become interest points powerful politicians, lobbyists others flying rubric ""administrative costs"", pushing point view. couple days ago new testing method returns results 90 minutes made fear mongering hub.

160,000 people dead US. Majority Redditors kids think kids able learn parents able work harmony. went site Provo Towne Center multiple sites throughout valley used. wonder parents kids living low number case areas realize front line vaccination programs? 

If vaccination safely available, vaccinations start areas undergoing outbreaks focus front line medical personnel, elderly immune compromised. areas rolled places like NJ order focus. Normal kids parents back line. year today, NJ parents vaccinated, I'd shocked.

OK causing death many Canada-wide poorly thought-out underfunded back-to-school plan? adds contingencies. kids clearly learn legally required curriculum year. special needs kids get legally required services. change laws say, ""OK y'all really achieve attendance test numbers."" *something*. can't put millions kids front screen year. Continuous development education obviously important every kid every age. 

But happens next year? can't tell everyone repeat grade. There's whole rabbit hole problems would cause. districts states would way. 

Some family members thought clever enrolled kids private school, private schools said opening normally. parents thought, ""If spend enough money, I'll daycare need work."" Unsurprisingly, private schools recently admitted can't either. one wants make call, simple risk liability. There's solution here. story------

As soon read paragraph, thought parents pump kids hydration meds, go school. saying case here, getting symptoms quickly seems bit off. went Walmart breathed everyone building. Without mask freedums. kids likely infected someone risk dying coronavirus. Lol one ever said kids danger, issue kids becoming *a* danger older teachers family members. 

Do people even hear talk?  Question: school supposed start September? funny switched raw death count deaths per capita, deaths per case.

And deaths per case relatively better deaths per capita. man, shit eventually going catch become even devastating.

When consider deaths per cases counting Deaths - completed state Total Cases - either become Cured Dead. perverse incentive actually infect people.

Because higher denominator means % obviously going go down. death per case going climb bad worse metric. He'll spin something else.

A major criticism US worldview WAY short-term oriented. make next quarter good possible, cares happens that. putting stock deaths per case hella short-term. Nice, that's really impressive! fucking go  point they‚Äôve kinda asked it. wish death anyone but...

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  plenty EU countries higher death rate per million. Well shit sherlock. I'm hoping maybe MLB opening day least half full stadiums Perhaps individual cages would budget friendly? Even simple chain wall trick One kid spreads kids stupid  CDC recommends 14 day quarantine? sure? percentage New Yorkers figure contracted virus? convicted 2018 sentence began Oct 2019, timing worse anything like happen. started hearing something going China Nov 2019. Let‚Äôs completely honest, matter many sources throw you, you‚Äôre actually going read them. sure. Deaths mostly plateaued starting day feds changed reporting handling agency. know several states started fudging numbers look better (looking Florida). There's good reason believe far worse recent numbers shown since they've become less reliable time goes Skee-lo approves misspelled freedumb maybe rich people actually bankroll politicians stabilize economy hand tax breaks. Universal masking would best, effective way stop spread disease.

Besides spread aerosols, possible virus also meaning stay air without droplets. virus may linger elevators, public bathrooms, offices, etc. 

During cold weather, people spend time inside buildings. Even social distancing, may exposed virus someone else room got there.

Masks reduce spread aerosols breathing, talking, coughing, etc. masks reduce spread flushing toilet. Flushing toilet releases aerosols. Wear mask public bathroom protect yourself, avoid public bathrooms much can. Maybe that‚Äôs us arguing masks (and schools reopening) ‚Äî aren‚Äôt following money üò£ suburban Stockholm pretty common.. visit stores like Willys Veddesta see 1 10 wearing mask. much nuanced national blanket statement seem indicating.

Your link reinforces point. course there‚Äôs nuance, Fauci definitely favor children going back school. one may ‚Äúwinning,‚Äù countries handling *much* better. US shit job.  guess infection rate remains low, schools take appropriate precautions (smaller classes, limiting interaction b/w students, masks, etc), able enforce quarantines coming state, I'm cautiously optimistic pull through.

It comes us NYers remaining diligent despite low infection rates.

I'm worried complacency setting folks letting guard down.

Like asthma really want catch covid-19. people respiratory conditions, real like yours, imagined, ones need wearing mask most... even uncomfortable. Oh my. mean second grader, probably picked nose, butt, ate it, rub handrail? Kids carry covid!!!! would thought :O 

How think going work I'm thinking quitting job riding rest year home wife kids. vaccine ready wife plans go back work I'll take care kids. going happen eventually, pandemic accelerated plan Dude it‚Äôs worse negligence. It‚Äôs depraved indifference. Drama Queen Good know. Well yea, don‚Äôt know people... stepdad's interested well employees family members? mean, foolproof protect viruses bacteria (as nothing 100% unless live vacuum), prevention/protection better none.

Also, uncomfortable outweigh discomfort perhaps fear work place get ill proper prevention place? Yikes.

This! absolutely insane. Yes last decade current situation continues. Huh weird trump said it‚Äôs ok :*( Deliberately. Schools teach critical thinking, philosophy, law order/rights, entrepreneurialism UK.

It's maths English science good monkey people   Stories people died refused help every hospital uncommon anymore, individual stories appearently enough yet get significant ground. Honestly feel like attempt lose funding. 

The way see maybe goes like this: little trump threatens cut funding schools open. schools still ultimately want protect kids taking seriously. 

trump say anything close back case infection found out. fact, think CDC said schools use precaution. could wrong.

So open up, get funding, close soon 1 student tests positive. I'm interested see start plowing money online products learning. 

This speculation part. would do. think remote learning would worse reopening schools still requiring social distancing?

First: large classrooms kids teachers could six feet them?

Second: child teenager room children teenagers gotten close them?

Third: ‚Äúsafe‚Äù everything closed (it‚Äôs actually safe), opening everything causing big spikes cases everyplace it. 

We‚Äôre ready yet. virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre sick staying home. Yeah, die eventually.  Thank god I'm American long contact tracing area tell Person infected Person B wich infected person C etc. children main driver outbreak, isolated spread disease uncontrollably. possible low case count. Something order less 25 per 100,000 newly found infected per day. soon go higher numbers risk untracable spread becoming way high think. layman parrotting scientist say.

I know numbers even available US right now. Small steps great progress $2.

Am right?

/s Tis article 2 months old take everything grain salt. independent provincial affairs? given anonymous code number checks phone nearby codes. one codes infected, get alert may need tested. 

What province that? didnt 3 months prepare Nearly 15,000 coronavirus patients listed 'presumed recovered' past week.

What mean? Wow that‚Äôs tragic. hope least little joy life got covid. guidance recommended throughout entire healthcare system US public maskless. reasoning was, didn‚Äôt enough modern masks country, didn‚Äôt want trust even consider old-school cloth technology, didn‚Äôt believe American public was/could educated enough use correctly enough make difference, even would detrimental publics lack ability trained use them. God fucking dramatic. care schools virtual, fear mongering ""everyone going get Covid die"" shit getting super old. truly advocating stopping making schools virtual, fine, can't keep ""shut everything down"" shit. advocating anything remotely like swapping one potential cause death another. student student didnt contact rest school? Bathrooms? Bussing? Lunch? Breaks sort? Time hallway? Etc etc. 

I don‚Äôt see approach quarantine directly around (her classmates teacher) let everything proceed normal. That‚Äôs legit slowly creeps schools Fauci straight admitted told people wear masks free PPE healthcare professionals. made much difference, sold instead saying ""hey, keep masks hand leave bulk healthcare workers"" said (and quote) ""There reason anyone right United States, regard coronavirus, wear mask.""

Also: [STOP BUYING ""updating based new evidence"" bullshit. Masks recommended preventing spread types illness since 1800s. strain Coronavirus, known related common cold. spreads droplets created coughing sneezing, prevented by... wait it... masks. new. ""new evidence"" fucking contagious virus is, spreads. I'm sure, we'll find winter. Nothing said true need stop spreading misinformation think part problem lies public health communication. get test, isolate get confirmed result. ""first day"" positives seem people test pipeline, following given directions. lockdownskeptic circle jerking. running ""joke"" mock people care public health measures complaining walking bodies get gym enjoy inflicting excruciating pain themselves. Hilarious.... know. wierd coping mechanism. beautiful, likes use phrase fucking reason comments someone suggests could good cutoff line discriminating ages. sort everyone height, taller people going older shorter people, average. laws requiring wear clothes cover naughty bits unconstitutional? 

Because masks seem lot practical. one going literally die seeing no-no parts. Lots biotech pharma companies. 

This even controversial. sorts experts march/april saying this. 

You still arguing one people can't admit incorrect back down. difference all. none nordic countries significant number people wear masks. - keep moving goalposts.

The actual question context conversation country whole produce greatest testing capacity possible. ""federal testing apparatus"" makes sense. UK - lab equipment hospital Manchester, largely lab equipment hospital London, lab equipment national laboratories.

In United States laboratory equipment Quest diagnostics, often different laboratory equipment University California system, different laboratory equipment New York State laboratories. fragmentation requires different testing procedures, different testing kits. 

I think going pretty transparent. overly political. talk ""lack leadership,"" ""time spent musing purchasing Greenland,"" (something happened August 2019 Covid 19 thing) really mean like Trump. I'm sure think leadership Fauci, Birx, career administrators CDC, excellent - Trumps. fine - going overly political better least fact back beliefs, - importantly - probably basing belief fact.

Overall United States done pretty good job testing capacity. perfect? No. testing per capita rate higher almost every country world, across population 330 million people, daunting task. government pretty quickly solved supply chain issues testing kits back spring, capacity growing since. countries higher testing capacity - well one city state - UK owns administers hospitals labs country, going easier time due to

This /r/politics, rule overly political posts subreddit. Cabbage pretty plentiful, need hoard zoomed pastor current speaker pulpit. wanted see audience. refused. two months kids gonna dead parents severe psychological issues blaming knowing probably gave parents virus killed them. takes time get results back labs typically affiliated hospital instead typically given state's health department. go hospital full lab, find turnaround time much better testing in-house. reason believe might covid positive need quick turnaround better go hospital public testing site. mess shows anything, shows dealing climate change similar idiotic manner. government run cartels, political parties pals vying lobbyists give money. know IRS already knows much taxes owe every year? still file tax companies like turbotax whatever lobby government pay keep us taxes, pay us. Yes, democrats less corrupt overall, think still quite abysmal. really need revolution point, revolutions scary, far, looks like grandchildren die see climate change really take effect. masks important, recommendations falling cracks like eating healthy, exercise, taking vitamin D.... Basically anything could strengthen immune system. sufferes Butmuhfreedumb medical condition? knew lack leadership would cause disharmony That‚Äôs garbage. home route given circumstance, able pick left it‚Äôs safe again.  second grader already Sounds pretty unpleasant.

That's really big deal long easily detect really infectious people. 

It's like seeing bright star sky vs dim one...only bright light infectious, need million dollar telescope able see sun. 

The PCR machines sensitive measured logarithmic scale (CT # number doublings). see Timmy go school, need know he's shedding virus, lingering RNA pieces. They‚Äôre idiots following con-man. 

Notice con-men usually prey idiots, reasonable people see them? con-man presidency, we‚Äôre seeing whose idiot nation-wide scale. Would happen say that, uh, flu bro? Hulu? test confirm virus 10 minutes. herd explained doesn‚Äôt differentiate virus though it‚Äôs usually test that‚Äôs followed test see virus active not. It‚Äôs like unicorn! immediate care facility offered limited testing. wait car 45 minutes exam, 30 minutes results. get from. i'm sure manifest. Thats.. good news. way spin good news. beginning^of ^^the ^^^end Good you. guess rest parents work keep roof kids head don‚Äôt really care them. write book. County recommends, require, children wear masks school whenever social distancing possible, according school district's reopening plan. district would require students wear masks statewide mandate place. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp fought mayors' attempts mandate mask use.

Kids make decision themselves. need tell put masks even watch them. joke. Giving PPE supplies requested, Cuomo bitched nothing ever enough. Low behold 40,000 ventilators 140,000 beds severely miscalculated wasn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôre either child, willfully ignorant. Hypocrite. No. gone interview know it. could rescheduled done plenty things stupid. Thank god state isn‚Äôt opening schools. least limit spread explodes south. several friends pulled kids district homeschooling. Fuck sending kid guinea pig. No, suicidal. Probably optimistically trying return normalcy ignoring may *be* new normal.

I unsure parts country, live, many, many families living poverty line, parents work daycare available (they've full months due new restrictions). sending children back school really option feel have.

The schools area also offered distance learning anyone now, people preexisting health concerns. parents complained enough available every student adjusted. unsure good/reliable distance learning be. spring, mess kids attend all. think ""excel"" means? feel lucky state 24-36 hour turn-around test results. Unfortunately, become harder asymptomatic individual's get tested...  need positive percent &lt;5% good place. 27% 18% good news. extent better weak. 

Like, 1,000 Americans dying every day. 2,977 died 9/11 terrorist attacks. Yes, technically, current deaths day less 9/11 terrorist attacks, that‚Äôs better daily COVID-19 deaths U.S. greater 9/11. point is: fact irrelevant, current situation still bad. places less process it‚Äôs quicker. imagine NY testing Georgia causing delays. pessimistic would 80% US's current fatality rate 3.3%. That'd 8.4 million dead Americans. 

But that's bit much considering testing failed hard there's way we're catching many Good example adult stupidity. Test results take 5-7 days return. Pupil didn‚Äôt walk get tested parent sent child school results pending. 

Gatorfan Know home healthcare company knowingly sent infected worker home visits. action taken internally. Friend worked found someone keep quiet top. they're afraid losing jobs come state laws actually side company's decision disclose. 

How many cases think like this? Everyone know caught covid, got work. office opening next week. essential worker working since March. feel unsafe af want risk job hunting economy. 8th highest number dead world per 1M population Sweden. 

The economic impact Sweden half rest Europe would personally preferred stricter response including use masks save thousands Swedes. Since unified testing program country, even state level, time needed results varies greatly. live NYC tested three times now. 

The first time May already past biggest surge established bunch pop testing centers. results took three days. 

The second time mid-June used testing center, however time results took 8 days.

The third time mid-July went clinic take care preliminary work visit via video call visit quick easy. time got results day half. antibodies implied every single time whine incessantly terrible virtual learning missing months school going ruin lives children.  things post motives suspicious. government doesn‚Äôt care want people excuse go back work get unemployment. Add hours work plus lunch breaks plus commute time every year say typical office job... I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs going total hours away kids 3 months NBA players live bubble. 

These guys going go long break next season spend every minute kids choose to. known beforehand fucking around virus unknown consequences risky.

wHo cOuLd kNoWn insightful lol know this, seems blatantly obvious Connected terms pandemic? Sure, even rich people afford stay public schools, get private treatment etc. Young people worry less dying disease. Retired people need risk anything. Connected yea, closely directly. 

Otherwise, all. People circles groups best make sure stay closed, especially power.

You arent *together* boss company, them, making far less do. died today they'd replace grieve second. care resource nothing more. Expand people know we're together nonsense feel good avoids facing actual issues like wealth disparity instance.

We together. this, there's you, that's all. hyrbid model seems stupid me. know local school district rotating kids teachers 4 days week. 

So, going get shitty education covid outbreaks. YEA! yeah neither want deny services elderly? That's cruel too. fuck ton duck tape. Let's arts crafts, y'all. $500 billion CARES act large businesses could gone people. can't believe president care one bit us going back work kids going back school care long stay president state's listen doctor's asking equipment help hospital thinks beg Shortly Trump took office, action taken reports data numerous organizations, mostly concerning climate environment. Information NOAA, NASA, National Weather Service, EPA several agencies routed White House ""review"", websites underwent ""streamlining"" thousands articles reports altered removed.

Information runs counter Trump GOPs narrative concerning pandemic, climate change, crises censored. Holy shit bad Yeah, dad's visiting nurse came cold-like symptoms. wear mask even though travelled internationally &amp; working immunocompromised patients. Made mad. least turned Covid positive, cold could still killed dad battling leukemia &amp; immune system. 

I'm sorry neighbor. pandemic taken lot good people. link proves point. clear age gradient data page. say ""bullshit""? even know read data? link shows 80% deaths point people age 65.

And link provided show influenza worse children: clear CDC data. link provided demonstrate T-Cell immunity prior coronavirus exposure prevalent. small children get coronaviruses far adults. Reading comprehension. LOL. really takes 3 days. Getting test harder waiting test. drove almost two hours away get day test I‚Äôd exposed I‚Äôd say one act spoke volumes integrity... intelligence.  Yes! I‚Äôm at, many people vocally saying administration pushes ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see goes‚Äù take pick always read people saying 'it is' basically saying 'fuck it' One problems last month lack reagents. Every lab runs test city ran low ran mid July supplier low/out there's much demand. like trying cook omelette without eggs. Can't run test without ingredients. version Hunger Games boring much tragic. Lol, argument anyone criticizing lockdown always ‚Äúyou care yourself‚Äù. consider others compromised immune systems, it‚Äôs reason wear mask. think people whatever makes feel safe, medical issues show surface. Another lockdown answer though. risk live someone risk, staying inside makes feel safe. critical lockdowns sympathetic towards risk people. processed 30,000 tests. useless look results exactly? journalist shit job. actuallty reporting put test performed. Reporting story leave crucial, basic facts imagination reader.

So either intentionally misleading, author bad. district (which starting virtual may go back person point) already said keep normal 10 absence policy year since agreed makes sense pandemic. Hopefully districts same! Yea madness schools begin, I'll keeping far far far away anyone 25. üíî agree. Terrible irony. Things could turned better economically done things properly first place. procedure April required covid test could proceed. test took 45 minutes return result. done in-house George Washington University Hospital. April. four months later testing organizations still take *days* get results? sub saying months economy would harder hit harsh lockdown countries makes sense, I‚Äôm sure either way, know lots covid products initially used taken medical use. I've thought this. There's really good answer, teachers really provide child care, like glorified babysitter. Maybe steady home parent already decided go cyber option could take kids. good answer. OK, ""celebrities"" trustworthy car dealers.
But I'd really like get official data this.
Unfortunately, countries utterly incompetent tracing data collection. Tbh might screen idiots covid symptoms still decided leave house I'm sheep! listen anyone feed lie world go back normal!

You're living fear! me! let go back living like - without forced care others!

/s essential workers bullshit. work designated essential worker start pandemic, told getting raise year. even come tropical storm passing yesterday. Naturally management got paid day came late. Let's honest, say ""essential"" really mean disposable. Trump winning presidency great mistery future civilization try unriddle. K wait, get longer... couple hospitals around part get reagent allotment month, we're sending every single covid reference labs. Quest, labcorp, mayo, etc buried again. alone sent 600 samples yesterday. sent hundred got in. able process single blood sample, shits hitting fan again, least shitty side Massachusetts. Okay, may correct. Someone shared article JAMA sub month ago conclusion prevalence impact population know article since can't reproduce assume misread it.

The original SARS virus caused infertility, suspected variation SARS virus well. recent article find conclusions hypothesis. 

I still believe highly likely cause male infertility. 

Sincerely, concerned human. Newport, Naragansat, ect.

Block Island also RI.

RI ton coastline little coastal towns. popular destination New England among people want beach vacation know crowded Cape Cod Maine get. get ton visitors area, though I've go RI work weeks ago, shocking amount southern plates, large showing Texas plates, something we've never really seen lot region.

And, unfortunately, going RI work anymore one clusters among RI staff shut operations there. smack middle tourist area; unfortunately surprised. dunno 10 days, flight days take test airport, web site tells results max 2-3 days Seems similar rest Scandinavian countries, really noticeably better countries heavily rely tourism. 

Shows virus main force causing economic downturn, shutdowns. I'd suggest looking demographics raw number, seeing argunent specifically certain demographic. places like South Korea, swap-based test shows results fast 10 minutes. However, reliability questionable many recommends taking multiple tests. think way every previous flu season? ""safe"" mean physical. weigh kids mental health we'll physical dangers, kids low thankfully. cut dry I'm kind tired hearing here. Kids fallen behind school due hard cutover remote learning, many districts drastically different plans every parent deal decisions unnatural difficult make. not, let's keep everyone home til vaccine available, many negatives come plan well. I'm saying let er rip schools black white decision anyone. really improvement, things same. 

It making things worse way, thousands infected know infected likely self-isolate. figures/estimates much world spends vaccine research signs spending increase?  US best testing. cases high. Winning think that's worth looking something like though understanding assumptions. Granted, government willing sacrifice people, that's probably go-to. stories heartbreaking. absolute nightmare several family members die timeframe. Interesting. I'm Utah County heard issues...maybe part Salt Lake county dropping counties gone up. Everyone please updoot visibility still closed testing sites storms. Sadly exact kind behavior would expect culture values individual rights freedoms else. first attitude runs counter collective fight pandemic. Oh boy title. really depends type test backed labs are. test take hour results depends live essentially. Herd immunity might work strain. 

Herd immunity works virus, exceptions. JFC, understand nothing virology. start hiring teachers willing adapt experiment virtual learning going last pandemic have.  people interested maintaining status quo actually trying find new ways reach students. either:

Eradicate seal off: New Zealand, Iceland, Taiwan

Slow spread: Everybody else.


90% world lives North Hemisphere. temperate regions. virus spread much easier months severity illness also increase.

Places like Sweden, NYC, etc built lot immunity populations.

That keep check.

Places like Norway didn't. took gamble. 

The virus going start picking steam next 2-3 months. going vaccine time frame. possible Europe gets approved one October take 2-4 months get sizable distribution. best case scenario.

So go back lockdown pray works out? 

For people mocked Sweden starting see main argument did. made mistakes they've built large immunity. Europe what? 

Masks far less effective people think. Hence even places high masks usage seeing increases (California, Japan, Spain, etc).

Masks slow spread down. 

Places watch:
Germany, China, Bay Area California, Czechia, SK, Japan.

Australia's ""success"" already failed. People want hear SK's suppression going fail soon too.

 Summer ending. places going face increase spread really way contain without going hard lockdown 6 months feasible.

Edit: conclude Sweden made mistakes kept saying nations embrace strategy. going right. Nations can't ""shut down"" next Spring. Test-trace-isolate works infection low. Winter weather make fantasy even places like South Korea robust system place extremely high compliance. going save you. get tests 15 minutes, nephew one last week (none us famous rich). problem bunch false negatives, positives accurate. 

The problem testing time line, school Monday positive Tuesday says likely positive going back school, especially showing symptoms. CT testing getting results back 48 hours normal tests, also rapid tester use folks show symptoms takes 20 min much limited availability that. Thank service

If spend much time Reddit may appear Covid USA thing Trump source evils.

Almost every country problems USA stupid shit USA govnt public/private institutions are. Mexico people burned hospitals, thrown stones doctors good majority thinks COVID excuse doctors steal juice knee (this real belief).

I think everyone take like hour research COVID responses countries. might open eyes political/partisan issue. easier find countries govnts made right decisions count didn't. think districts Canada require staff students stay home symptomatic, afaik nothing gets shut anywhere point. would silly; going shut sniffles, even open. America fucked ""Lockdown Generation"" ??? know one year considered generation.

I feel bad graduating high school college, come on. like bad job recessions recent past (ahem, 2008/2009, ahem).

At least kids/teens/college students communicate easily whole host online video chat apps. gonna rough little bit longer things recover. problem district providing additional sick leave. must quarantine 14 day‚Äôs 10 14 allotted sick days have. doesn‚Äôt include school you‚Äôre 72 hour free symptoms including runny nose sore throat. going forcing lot staff make choice: Either stay home get paid come work sick potentially spread covid. Let‚Äôs forget every school there‚Äôs least one ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù person (in school it‚Äôs dumbass NURSE) won‚Äôt take precautions seriously.

Shit complete cluster Right? Less testing means less cases! US wrong strategy along. wonder highest cases per capita, highest testing per capita well! didn‚Äôt insist testing much, wouldn‚Äôt mess! /s Stupid politicians stupid followers.

Americans want daycare, care cost lives. Wtf talking about? Bolsonaro 4 times! NuRsInG hOmEs



Yeah fucked instead giving peddling false treatments rebounded look new york  I'm saying ""50% accuracy"" would mean wrong half time, making results meaningless. think actually meant identifies coronavirus 50% people it. lots false negatives still identifies many people. I‚Äôd rather keep ducks I‚Äôm powerless. way keep row NOBODY COULD SEEN COMING

Board insistent fighting teachers ok that. Yeah stupid. someone small children potentially going back school fucking news story. Oh no! I‚Äôve always wanted visit Jollibee‚Äôs Va Beach, never have. missed chance? know, test less, fewer positives! AMIRITE? GAH, idiot. Sometimes feel claustrophobic mask uncomfortable. keep mask passes. Sad hear teens south keep getting infected Murderers, them. arrests start? Put smug hipsters prison! same, slowly getting better? believe virus extent weakened ability kill, i.e. severity health adversities may come alongside getting corona? Also, would say point could also like common cold it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really affect us point we‚Äôd quarantine?

Thanks advance! wrong assume everyone wears mask schools? wearing mask feel sick go public

I totally agree something states long time now, *highly* doubt american going wear mask ever people vaccinated return sort semblance normality. Everyone thinks mask thing weird I'll never understand big deal. hold back 2 years affect lives lmao Callous disregard human life. It‚Äôs necessary factor prove psychopathy. It‚Äôs linchpin conservative policies. surprise. True. can't fathom disregard safety. mean main problem Americans living paycheck paycheck, daycare EXPENSIVE. friends pay like 400$ week daycare.. That's rent. lot parents put terrible situations choose sending kid school job. children arent going die. 

Your 30 year old teachers arent gonna die. 

1100 people age 35 died ""COVID"". know reporting skewed too. 

This CDCs info. 

Teachers students going die. 60 year old teacher option retire find somewhere teach online. 

The kids need go back school. fine. especially since grade school aged kids exempt wearing masks public. go daily walk see kid less 3' high path, go WAY way avoid them. 

They're bad enough spread stomach viruses, strep, flu...I know, I've raised couple kids know like watch various diseases travel around family couple times...but comes CV19, thank you. Ah yes, Nazis fine people party. many patients work going state vacation planning next weeks, absolutely infuriating. I'm trying insensitive fair play working 60 hours week. can't say laziness everyone's job different requirements. people ability this. respect that's great everyone will. [But already know kids spread COVID, really know 
The child spread tested positive, see MUCH. Yep, it‚Äôs feedback loop human misery. Like think neg hubbie positive, pikachu face Anyone else find funny 4 months told kids get spread school starts sudden kids positive Yeah stretch think. I'm trying sound like medical expert... things seem like false hope least Ontario, families option opt in-person learning choose distance learning children.

Let's hope Canadians paying attention Americans closely learning exactly do. title soooooo miss leading. takes like weak even test positive anything. 

This title infers little child goes school first day sick. 

It say parents sent sick kid school others possibly get sick. AKA: state governor interested pandering administration party. CDC states KN95 masks kept medical providers critical PPE. everyone starts buying them, even less go around doctors. Since they're reused, continue buying supply. Please consider using cloth mask social distancing instead. Yeah, you‚Äôll handing kids drive thru way ski slopes. That‚Äôs incredibly reckless say. 
Shitty funding leads shitty schools. relationship population density.

Let's go September college football kickoff. mess. time Tennessee bans home recording studio buisness. Honestly, wouldn‚Äôt surprised schools winging it. friend works NYC public school teacher, there‚Äôs basically plan understanding it. school left fend itself. instead planning school year, she‚Äôs planning basic PPE. morning, NYC public school system large one left isn‚Äôt full-remote start school year. always kills w/the school discussion mindset ""they're young.

I buy that. group highest risk serious problems. teachers adults school greater risk. Similarly parents adults interact home greater risk.

To risk kids functioning means quickly easily spread Coronavirus. And, people get kids, beyond personal suffering, also impact medical resources.

Dismisses articles ive sent becuase sources bull shit sending articles breitbart similar sources. fighting freedumbs!

The Abs half life 2.5 months, unusual viral Abs. However, far immune system Abs. memory cells, cells, etc., based know, likelihood life long immunity. course need decades data prove that, based know similar coronaviruses, good go.

Of course, virus mutate eventually mutant strain may evade immune system's defenses, past exposure current virus likely result cross reactivity, make infection mutated virus less severe.

If get infected, get sick, get hospitalized, die, good thing, bad thing. young people get infected little symptoms, better better vulnerable herd immunity. course hope that. think states parents reckless irresponsible. I'm actually scared flights, guy. Chill tf out. Well considering *can't* test positive (according scientists doctors) day exposed, I'm willing bet got someplace else. However, help students possible risk. 

Lord kids going educated this. future scary think of. sounds like daily life lol. I‚Äôm stupid though. Eh going matter. Statistically someone spread like wildfire weekly test would catch it.

That's even potentially throwing away lives prospect money, that'd throwing away lives *literally nothing.* even legal? Demanding someone payes fine spot? someone dresses police officer goes around demanding 150 euro fines everyone without mask? say this? see evidence ""otherwise healthy"" people significant risk? evidence actually contrary. vast majority serious cases deaths among people reason compromised immune system - including vitamin deficiency. fact, seen evidence whatsoever anyone died COVID-19 was: (1) eating healthy diet, (2) supplementing vitamin D, (3) exercising daily, (4) getting adequate sleep, (5) smoking, (6) obese. Whenever read ""otherwise healthy"" that's quoting family member based journalist actually verifying he/she 6 things. People actively go guidelines personally prevent virus spreading generally called ""Covid Idiots"", least Twitter. care China's number think entitled better condition whatever Chinese in. Chinese better, must fake enforce approving administering vaccine, honestly even I'm going start believing conspiracy theories. difference between, ""we're social distancing could result massive death hundreds thousands completely overwhelm healthcare system,"" ""we're social distancing people could still die.""

You can't run society on, ""don't anything someone might die.""

However, think way slogan meant interpreted ""Make America Greatest Again"", implying America undergoing considerable backslide. suppose that's Biden adopt - keep MAGA, tweak slogan stands ever slightly.

Besides, apparently ""Make America Great Again"" trademarked political use, Biden use anyway. think ""MAGA"" still fair game, available assigning new slogan. would unofficial anyway already slogan - uninspired ""Our Best Days Still Lie Ahead.""

Barron stay home Stop panic peddling! Douche bag, beyond fucking moronic Republicans what‚Äôs wrong world. Probably fishing. statement actually mean?

The death rate (as proportion infection) going down. Ie people recorded COVID fewer reported dead.

This doesn‚Äôt make disease less deadly. It‚Äôs artifact entirely expected statistics, two main reasons:

1) we‚Äôve got better managing people hospitalised. learned tricks, drugs effect, etc, meaning hospitalised there‚Äôs greater chance get alive. means enough stop lots people dying, less back March.

2) we‚Äôre testing people, milder symptoms. Back March, large proportion positive tests reported people turning hospital major symptoms. weren‚Äôt really large scale testing yet. - tests reported ‚Äúreally sick‚Äù people, lot died. That‚Äôs high death rate proportion reported cases. *Now* (correctly), test much mildly. much sniffle, it‚Äôs possible get test. you‚Äôre positive - well, might get much worse that, probably won‚Äôt die. proportion people get worse get hospitalised, smaller proportion die. overall, many many positive tests, relatively fewer deaths beginning pandemic.

That doesn‚Äôt mean deaths ‚Äúreliable‚Äù statistic. ‚Äúunreliable.‚Äù Like statistic, open interpretation. Look Trump idiotic interview Axios night, waving around piece paper claimed US deaths ‚Äúthe lowest.‚Äù Sure, choose ‚Äúas proportion cases‚Äù statistic, point pandemic reasons outlined above, you‚Äôre going get good-looking outcome compared countries. it‚Äôs pretty irrelevant statistic ‚Äúhow country going‚Äù country different testing levels US.

Ultimately saddest thing beginning USA wealthiest, smartest country world. USA actually quite detailed sensible plans deal pandemic like this. something previous administrations considered many times, drawn detailed plans for, rehearsed prepared deal with.

All thrown window Trump administration, sudden (as interview night) ‚Äúnobody could seen coming.‚Äù Well, people actually *did* see coming, it‚Äôs job surround people care planning sort thing see coming. That‚Äôs pretty huge failure leadership, rest world, pretty astonishing see USA completely drop ball this. simply would expect wealthy country like US comprehensively screw up. it. thought US first world country? Striking may patriotic thing teachers do. send message lives students lives fodder inaccurate inflated right-wing talking points. hope never find many people die, world, every day. havent spoken doc it.

For example, Umatilla county oregon hit right now. 234/100k cases. reality, since Umatilla 77 k people, 180 cases. 180 people getting sick realm one two groups breaking quarantine. groups Portland, impact rate would zero. since Umatilla, make county seem like high rate (which do), says little Umatilla's policies. Umatilla could strict enforcement, would still possible one two groups get away breaking law. point smaller counties rule breakers, chance, play larger role affecting per capita rates.

Of course, vast majority rural counties oregon normal case rates, look counties aggregate, case rates better match city (although rural counties also advantaged cities due inbuilt social distancing).

Wtf think? mean New York absolutely rocked. South? California? Arizona? kind junk garbage this? Proactive still people calling death. gross stupid mask up. true, agree.

I hope new reality better one. see (I think German) study damage heart? 75% people recovered showed damage included people hospitalized. Preventing hospitalization might enough. absolutely care, they're scared shitless. truly care it, react poorly whenever false reality questioned. 

Denialism toxic coping mechanism. see every tragedy, notably holocaust. usually people whose views least somewhat line whoever lose truth, like ultraconservative nationalists holocaust. also see Neo-Confederate Lost Causers, CCP apologist tankies, modern Turkish response Armenian Genocide. 

This pandemic different. Venn diagram lose truth deny basically circle. way handle disregard fact create solipsistic reality. ‚Äúobsessed online games.‚Äù ‚Äúconvinced viewpoint right one.‚Äù ‚Äúfiercely ignorant.‚Äù

Do get it? Like Kermit Frog meme. Psssst. us side actually care science. Centers Distributing Coffee lost respect thing. Even Fauci, seems everyone‚Äôs favorite, whus actually sounding alarm. one alarmed be. 

I idea species, little care one another. see world way this, see really end day. survived SARS 1 MERS kind literally did. Israel nearly doubled teaching staff reopen schools ""safe"" conditions less kids per classroom enforcing distancing, etc. Etc. still complete disaster constant rolling shutdowns schools cases quickly spread student populations general population causing spike cases.

In US.... We're reopening extra resources, extra teachers, extra precautions general 'wear mask' guidance somehow expect disaster. No, is? Absolutely fuck you. know you‚Äôre anti-social redditor dipshit doesn‚Äôt normally talk people leave house even shit going down, rest us social lives important shit get makes stay 6+ feet apart next 3 years impossible. thought (America's) death rate improving slightly we've improved treatment methods since early spring. WITHOUT MASKS.

That going bad!! added need person re-test end 10-day isolation, ""most people confirmed COVID-19 continue positive test results several weeks.""  County's guidance completely line assessments virus Centers Disease Control. [survey available found people ""mild moderate"" COVID-19 symptoms infectious longer 10 days. However, serious ""severe critical"" symptoms found contagious ""20 days symptom onset.""

I'm sure Educator this, though. Probably ly got downvotes? know found cases deaths per/cases number would drop? interview said that's matters, want increase testing make percentage smaller? seen nothing support this. provide evidence? New York Times interactive map, county level, see risk infected people arriving school 500 within first week. couple counties state West Virginia would 0 (if even 500 student school counties). OTOH, worst counties 5. **many** counties South, odds 10 infected first week. said, open?

Here's link.  66% recovered COVID patients permanent long term disability imagine fucked US economy going be?

Many, many places. going awful, care burden cost simply providing lifesaving care enormous.

But good thing opened bars two weeks guess. Childcare centers remained open using small, ""podded"" (no mix) groups reason.

This won‚Äôt work upper grades. local high school already kids mixing precautions house parties around town time. kids different ‚Äúpods‚Äù together parties essentially shut school. You‚Äôre going stop parties administrator lock kids school campus hours. ‚Äú allowed participate things like large events gatherings, eating inside, going malls etc. vaccinated pose big risk.‚Äù

So think sort system place shopping malls, eateries sports stadiums tell non vaccinated people take hike? That‚Äôs pipe dream. Funny mention Monster, Monster Zero Ultra white cans (zero carbs, zero sugar) go-to pick-me-up drink years quarantine, they're much lighter syrupy like energy drinks know packed B12. nothing close B12 ZipFizz. 

Similar feeling, think I've fully switched ZipFizz ensures drink ample water too. they're $1 per tube amazon, much cheaper lasts longer top water bottle time gets half full. FAKE use cepheid rapid TAT 1:15 practice, checked July‚Äôs stats.

If think test 45 minute run time going go collection results within hour, you‚Äôre probably great fit career lab administration. would fair teachers. Schools put educators risk death order teachers earn enough survive. 

Who take risk cleaning children raging pandemic? parents one else. surprise nobody tbh POTUS tells test, one gets sick. one dies. wonder places really touched yet. Somewhere like San Francisco done good job avoiding huge outbreak maybe due later. maybe flattened curve well keep steady level numbers vaccine comes along. Something like 70% polio cases asymptomatic, better COVID-19 lol # 1! :/  Open school recieve state funds outbreak close ez money :) make China pay. spread china-aids across globe. Many forced governor/legislature open. restrict it, knowing they'll shut go virtual couple days in, like wanted...

So, many instances kabuki dance leadership requiring. Simpsons? Jfc.

I just...  hated flying knew breathing everyone else‚Äôs fart breath. certainly won‚Äôt getting plane choice ever again. guess go motions appease lawmakers, constituency, POTUS. That's test taking 24 hours though. That's logistical problems.

Running PCR still take 24 hours.


And Earth would even try explain 7 day delays oh courier took hour?


The point still stands, time run PCR causes delays, things.

Hence simply introducing faster PCR test change even less lab next state over. Honestly one great things pandemic immunology terms widespread things. difficulty teaching everyone basically starting zero, there's least familiarity words like antibody cell makes explaining much easier.

I try best spread knowledge forum others times arise man hard keeping deluge misinformation pseudoscience also spread around right now. come terms fact expert (which still feels weird personal level) expert responsibility help educate try stop spread dangerous information. saying herd immunity requires 70% infected? Scientifically illiterate. Hmm. definitely doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô, become less less effective spreading. Every person Covid person cannot spread it, least while. Seeing Italy, France, Sweden (who next nothing lower deaths) NYC etc went similar curves suspect herd resistance (not immunity) got high enough point R0 struggles get 1 even ineffective social distancing practiced. 

Countries like Korea, Vietnam Japan used different techniques beat (for now) Covid. NY, Italy, France, Sweden etc late ineffective didn‚Äôt ‚Äòbeat‚Äô Covid huge segment population immunity make much easier do. bad takes 800-1200 deaths per 1m people add tool. best could realistically bring 5/6 students max room make sit far away humanly possible much cough send home immediately really worth point Nipah cause personality changes.

Far common scary stuff. They're also weak underfunded. 8th 193 pretty close 1 haters Fuck republicans gambling lives children stop looking headlines keeping news triggering PTSD.

The virus deadly children. taken straight CDC website.

Stop listening media research. Taken straight CDC guys wanna cite gospel refuse data lol ok. Top kek fuck help, anyone could assumed beginning would least marginally beneficial... Doctors literally wear masks surgery prevent what... operating room halitosis. CDC several funding cuts 2017, too.

Seriously worse Sweden like nothing. Yes! open classes fantastic. mean expect. schools eventually kids test positive get covid control. I'm happy highschool already said atleast first 9 weeks school online. Though sucks miss friends, I'd rather safe :) mean, go google median salaries Ivy Top 25 school shitty state school. That's life works.

There always outliers, I'm one, completely disingenuous think people name shitty directional state school opportunity ivy grads.

How confrontational comment? bad EU Canada accepting American refugees. wasn‚Äôt fact live parents would prefer wear mask, wouldn‚Äôt even that. I‚Äôm healthy nineteen year old comorbidities personally, I‚Äôd rather catch start building immunity (if don‚Äôt already) live fear something would likely effect me. I‚Äôd absolutely hang kids it, trust studies science Wait two weeks results guess. Considering extent covid endemic within USA moment, wiping couple hundred arm rests several times day really going diddly squat big picture. sub good news? look sub good news flair comments really negative lot time Whatever need tell yourself. stories getting old, everyone realize kids going school going work moment unless want successfully inoculate actual virus take chances... either or. think wealth important factor case. Many people country prefer wealth dead grand parents.

Note: aware unchecked covid outbreak lot damage dead grand parents. Unfortunately many isn‚Äôt aware(including Trump). knew science ""ideology"" Hmmm, maybe asymomatic person gave her, maybe parents unintentional carriers? Fauci: masks mostly help people around

Let's keep away politics, folks.


Rules sub, disagreeing you. great input kid got tested morning results 15 minutes. several ‚Äúrapid testing‚Äù centers area. wait passenger flights remotely piloted Yeah, increased death rate lagging testing spike 4-6 weeks. starting see July 4th impact. Herman Cain perfect example this. Probably got June 20th, tested positive couple days later. hospital battling 4 weeks. 

People don‚Äôt die immediately testing positive cases. hospitalized fight weeks.

I don‚Äôt think death rate going time soon, unfortunately. blame CDC one. 

Where evidence corona spread surfaces? Yet CDC basically wrote months ago couple weeks work getting everyone page far expectations technology use go remote would incredible teacher. rumors possible shutdown Friday county announced schools would closed ""for 2 weeks, lol"" evening March. never saw students online. Even 4 days person split cohert (so two days kid) would lead much better remote learning experience students. also county 5 daily cases per 100k good 20 times worse areas atm. different perspective y'all. That‚Äôs cruel hell. Clearly experience COVID didn‚Äôt teach shit. Lol you‚Äôre ready parent. Covid stay almost 100%.it spread way much. Even perfect vaccine, many use afford 8 billions shots easily made distributed either. war (total extinction) long lost.
Still live may get back almost normal, depends effectiveness vaccine. said NYC, NYS. NYC .19% population killed covid. soon before? Covid often remains dormant 14 days. read full story, sure true is, heard non-mask wearing students, intentionally pulled masks students. anyone confirm this? Sanitizing hands works even better Crazy agency that's funding cut year year since 2017 seem resources. Scared see reopening schools turn out. kinda weird none prominent voices certain side life praising NBA showing us keep sports going it? Hmmmm. Hahaha - think seconds clicked. Steinway wishes Miami.

But yeah, basically altered walking routes minimize time party avenues. walk 28th Av instead 30th stick side streets whenever possible. Steinway hard unless go specific location (FedEx store), case try go early morning possible. freedoms!/s

I hate economy important people helping run. 

I happy least area people wearing masks hand sanitizer available stores wipe carts etc. I've able work home. knows long people continue though? Cases dropping thanks 1) many people give damn modified behavior reduce spread 2) many people infected we‚Äôve reached something like herd immunity.

With way people behave, R0 1.2 so. level need 15-20% infected drop R 1.

Tada, alone explains timing roughly magnitude peaks AZ, FL, TX, states, country whole.

It‚Äôs states responded well. It‚Äôs they‚Äôve responded poorly. I'm former Christian, practicing one, literally exact point two criminals crucified alongside Jesus? One repents Jesus says join kingdom god?

That particularly Catholic notion, essentially point even mentioning two guys. Honestly freedom right now? Citizens US completely botched virus response. citizen New Zealand??

Kiwis go school, go rugby games, country welcome tourists.

US cusp another lock 200k+ dead, can‚Äôt travel, go school, others go school get shut again... 

Equating wearing mask ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù infantile childish mindset we‚Äôre losing ACTUAL freedoms right now... probably flu season. aerosol transmitted way, precautions help. Flu season died immediately locked down, Australia getting yet (well, couple weeks ago, reporting). seems safe. haven‚Äôt heard outbreaks traced beaches example yet. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised well it‚Äôs gone level play pretty good too. get playoffs without slip I‚Äôd impressed. shouldnt need said people......but Thats Coronavirus ravaged NYC beginning killing 30k+, yet they‚Äôre fucking applauded? Extrapolating numbers (32,500 deaths 8.4M population) nationwide (350M people) would amount 1.37 MILLION deaths.

STOP APPLAUDING NEW YORK CITY NHL bubble well, Baseball players want bubble, NFL supposedly many players personnel bubble (I heard people saying they'd need 200 people per team). Keep responses mind voting next school board directors school district leaders, area those. agree ideologically 

What's ideology? specific. questions context deflecting wish push teachers back covid furnace, willing make sacrifice. Washington, get test results next day Terrible comparison. One deliberate, reckless prove infected first place.  Morse, 6, died testing positive COVID-19, according parents.  Jackson-Madison County Health Department Director Kim Tedford confirmed death press briefing Wednesday morning. 

Are saying thinks tested positive? County Health Department Director lying also? Stop, scaring :( combined set p1/p2 subjects quite large now.
So looks like high success rates younger people 20-55.
But course primary target. needs decent success old, diabetics etc. Yeah accurate they. relative works hospital lab. send tests bigger University hospital get results now. went 8 hour turnaround time 48 hour minimum basically overnight. school charging online actually. It‚Äôs ~$200 online

It ~$150 person 0.4% mortality. cases worse cold. still treating mortality rate 70% range? dangerous enough warrant response. not. know health officials understand almost they're politicians too. parents Gigi Morse, 6, said died COVID-19, would make first childhood death Madison County related coronavirus County Health Department Director Kim Tedford confirmed death press briefing Wednesday morning.

Direct quote article. ü§ûü§û Obviously. Arm cattle prods! Come now, Christian willfully spread deadly pathogen. God vaccine working, folks.

Regardless that, family deserve threatened. Seems like downvotes think it‚Äôs OK behavior exist. point stupid poorly made top vaccine endgame hell is?

Maybe try reading said unclear stage effective vaccine be. said key questions remain degree duration immunity vaccine provide, dosage needed whether prevent people getting infected altogether simply prevent severe illness requiring warned even vaccine tested deemed safe effective, challenges distributing widely need likely enough vaccines population,"" said Tam. ""So there'll prioritization we're looking that."" Oh look again! Still full complete dog shit see. hey time quoted text! Holy shit moving world sport.

So, let's read came from, time, let's give full context instead spreading false narrative like right wing terrorist.

That quote states (Emphasis mine)

Returning school important healthy development well-being children, must pursue re-opening way safe students, teachers staff. Science drive decision-making safely reopening schools. **Public health agencies must make recommendations based evidence, politics. leave health experts tell us time best open school buildings, listen educators administrators shape it.**

‚ÄúLocal school leaders, public health experts, educators parents must center decisions reopen schools, taking account spread COVID-19 communities capacities school districts adapt safety protocols make in-person learning safe feasible. **For instance, schools areas high levels COVID-19 community spread compelled reopen judgment local experts.¬†¬†A one-size-fits-all approach appropriate return school decisions.**

Now please, stop full shit. That's do.

Either feel would seen insensitive ridiculous point can't make fun it. agree things need fixed, make difficult vote. important state reasons vote, reasons make extra effort vote, believe need start looking issues/framing discussing them. vote get fixed, things continue get even worse. next time wanna taken care pandemic, top tier basketball player. Got it.  Exactly. 

The conversation needs be: Here's really need open safely. it! can't open safely.

The conversation actually: need convince people safe open, make many low cost measures make sound like safer. ""But gave hand sanitizer cheap cloth mask!"" Weird, thing people said could happen happening? thought either got better died! That's everyone said! side effects! Tramp said so! keep shape, work emotional bullshit got going on, past trauma, etc time ready go - ready legit, mature, well adjusted relationship. No, none true. one antibody tests great degree, test positive antibodies likely infectious more. sub 1 tests PCR mildly less sensitive 3-4 hr PCR tests. Hes fucking trying. Dosent help many dont listen first place It‚Äôs beautiful infection. one day, like that, disappear. obviously seen DeSantis' press conferences.   Imagine US President responsible rabid hateful fanatical devotees threatening life one administration's top advisors. man proudly served several administrations.

Bizzaro Trump Land getting weirder weirder... Allowing people wear masks deem feasible proven recipe disaster.

They specified classrooms, hallways, buses. guess infeasible force people wear cafeteria? people know even planning eating school. changed intend make?

Unspecified. guess regular maintenance? MLB can't really work bubble due roster size well space required it, AZ FL locations adequate facilities 1: they're hotspots, 2: players rejected bubble either area partly due extreme heat time year would make playing impossible/unethical.

The NBA keep entire bubble secure one campus, logistically impossible MLB, even chose ignore 2 issues, still farce bubble hotel, transit, field require strict monitoring... every team. either every hotel worker, bus driver, etc. join bubbles extra 50+ people per team lockdown 3/4 months well really ""bubble"" begin with.

Baseball easiest sport socially distance I'm optimistic season finishing seeing inter-team transmission yet Marlins already cleared play. hear shrug  showing 161,223 right think means dosent agree science Fwiw always said ""supply teacher"" school. Please keep kids home. KIDS. Fuck school repercussions. Worse. President Comacho actually employed people smarter cared citizens. them, won‚Äôt change mind it‚Äôs child dying. public figure pandemic hit. would imagined infectious disease expert would need security family warned people infectious disease? I'm sorry deal this. I'm Canada schools reopening September. I'm going sound totally clueless right schools open right anyway? 2 month summer break norm North America? LOL hell mom dad too, right?   .. understand constraints Alberta. first gates testing, handled early days exceptionally well.

At point feel like government Alberta stopped caring, stopped adjusting system handle evolving scenario.

There marked moment time health minister took backseat Kenny, economics started play bigger role safety.

.. guess that's ass backward Republican province gets votes.

Our provincial government cut education funding previous year, sent two masks teacher, think job done.

Fucking assclowns.

I've got really good ideas signs upcoming teachers strike. ""KENNY MURDER COUNT"" pictures names people died decisions. Thank you, sub. definitely helps talk people.  ball pits get removed due germs? Everytime kids return school sick hell first months. Kids super spreaders even govt says different. Italy even single child death? remember looking data handful deaths even 40. (America) seem outlier many younger deaths having. :( Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 2020 nutshell constitution piece paper, get arent paying quality, paying prestige

Yale would admit true also prove made clear true prospective students. I'm guessing willing that. hope schools understood planned distance learning well. 

My hopes may high Normal people die COVID. enough kids get it, chances normal kids going die COVID. we‚Äôre letting kids packed schools, especially middle high schools studies show likely adults spread it, many kids going get it‚Äôs matter probability normal kids going die it. Even kids don‚Äôt die, that‚Äôs hell lot adults clearly risk now. adults get it, spreads outside school scenario well, furthering pandemic whole.

On matter taxes... realize taxes already partially go funding online public schools existed covid, right? taxes would paying make hybrid system likely, but, even wasn‚Äôt, takes money pay teachers, adapt curriculum, get equipment kids need it, etc. 

Funny call disgusting reasoning forcing kids situation dangerous could potentially dangerous don‚Äôt want waste tax dollars. Hope one close dies you‚Äôre greedy fuck Fear? think so.

Fear get 1000 Covid deaths/day orange-tinted, dementia-ridden, adderall-snorting leader moment country needs united fight raging pandemic, drives social division sole purpose getting re-elected.

That, friend, start feel fear. Agreed. infection rates closer 1.4% US population, exponential good enough fit, that's going start unrealistic 2-3 doublings (5-10%)\* NY opening schools? Sad thing is, daughter's school already kinda happen. week schools closed, 2nd grade teacher got mildly sick, teacher's sister (also teacher, although different school) hospitalized ICU month confirmed covid. neither old unhealthy! course parents sending virtual love support back then. seem matter nearly 80% district teachers uncomfortable person. ""all politics"" crap like that. 

I know parents would suddenly demand know school child got sick died. Gotta get post-natal abortion numbers up! May 'Rona you!

And also you! Pro tip: Alcohol tastes house, actually tastes better it't watered down. here‚Äôs story. Figured I‚Äôd let known. work FedEx, specifically world hub Memphis, contracted virus co-worker coming work symptoms didn‚Äôt tell anyone. bad headache lost taste smell weekend. July 4th, 5th, 6th. Called manager Monday said symptoms. told come found night co worker exposed tested positive Saturday. assumption couldn‚Äôt take test Saturday get results back day? Anyways, I‚Äôm sure exposed bunch people unintentionally weekend. entire in-law side family quarantine me. started headache, lost taste smell, fatigue body aches settled bad. fatigue like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced. I‚Äôm avid gym goer always thought I‚Äôve exceptional endurance strength. something different though. two weeks battled this. FedEx used rest vacation sick days had.. allowed go back taste smell hasn‚Äôt returned almost month later I‚Äôve recovered. Idk situation.. haven‚Äôt gotten paid two weeks. I‚Äôm afraid loss taste smell might permanent. Idk options gov. Aid could qualify for. Also.. post COVID don‚Äôt feel same. feel substantially weaker. Like body lower tolerance anything requiring prolonged use muscles. thing FedEx screens thousands employees upon entering fever. never ran fever entire time sick. make pretty decent money compared contract virus idk could possibly do. feel like I‚Äôd need find another job one work literally going get killed. Yeah, typically kids would school now. However, governor worried safety millions children pushed return date two weeks encouraged everyone take time attend church pray safe school year. really? Last saw 158k, close hate rounding numbers involves human lives. guess flu strains. Here, target known. Ideologically? !

How even know ‚Äúideology‚Äù is?
I‚Äôve never seen guy quoted saying anything REMOTELY ideological. company makes 45 minute tests enough machines make plastic cartridges. Since April would switched 2 day turnaround time test shortage. isnt true. locality, parents overwhelmingly favor reopening schools get free daycare meals. School still decided remain shutdown remote classes only. Good suggestion. reinforces goal really protect children's mental health development. goal get back daily day care parents thay can't work home go back work make enough money feed kids without school lunch.... Christian leaders need read bible. says people disease need stay away camps. often surprised little Christian leaders seem know actually bible. specific explicit ‚ÄúCommand sons Israel send away camp every leper everyone discharge everyone unclean dead person. shall send away male female; shall send outside camp defile camp dwell midst.‚Äù sons Israel sent outside camp; Lord spoken Moses, thus sons Israel did."" Numbers 5:2-4 might able test 250 samples working hour, probably able work hour straight.

For handlers, depends. they're training dogs - years. they're getting already trained dogs supporting could much much faster. 


There several breeds work, every dog breed takes. negative day before? Oh, well settles that. man far right saying wants kill vaccine suddenly right. Got love fucktard logic. Yeah I'm sure would given priority, true. I'm thinking Italy, doctors stripes become covid ICU staff even calling docs retirement. mean long HCWs willing relocate hard hit areas probably happen. schools reopening around country... Brilliant. Wont 4 weeks cases take natural course. absolutely disgusting. hope get better. love Sinise, awesome actor, awesome person ratio experts infected people quickly approaching 1:1. I‚Äôm currently NYC I‚Äôm preparing spike school starts. public schools starting many universities well students coming country world. first weeks school already hotbed disease sickness even outside pandemic we‚Äôre definitely going backslide bit end month. anyone really surprised happened Hospitals overrun. else gonna put them? blame nursing homes failing job properly isolate people, leaders trying keep people alive. one ""COUMO BAD FACTS MATTER"" people? compilations studies estimating true number cases? Skimming article titles Google seems suggest reported cases always small fraction actual cases, something unique BC. I'm Toronto tentatively favour opening schools younger kids especially. social educational benefits kids parents high worth risk right cases like 10 day entire city. bull don‚Äôt believe Plague rats, u/mrmudzi... uhhh... nearly 200,000 people died half year bro. real reason tell people keep hitting head things. First off, normal kids die COVID. can't point single case. 

And lastly, I'm forcing anyone put kids situation feel dangerous. Im saying public schools need open, parents need figure want educate kids 3 damn good options. Public school, private school, homeschool. Shutting public schools option. CDC estimates infections 10x higher cases. Also: hoax. 

And gonna go away soon.

With leadership like that, country would screwed. care they're saying Cuomo, he's much keep state crumbling. happened whole nurseey home deal anyways? reaaallly entire fault something directly oversee that? see darndest. created LLC hold stocks, disperse donations happen. far‚Ä¶

Total Dispersed:	$ 171,437,418.00
Total Remaining:	$ 2,466,105,308.95 Tell magnitudes don‚Äôt get counted irrelevant non issue. Stfu pro social distancing words, get back work, slaves.

This madness, end well. feel like I'm gaslighted entire country. feel like I'm going lose *all* friends social distance stay home. barely coverage coronavirus situation country. government done anything since March, held parades, people went bars football matches, even careless recent flu epidemics (we basically pulled Sweden, waaaaay worse). 

The situation positive officials say is. last months every time leave house see ambulance every ten minutes. know people work medical field confirm official numbers ridiculously low. even doctors always wearing masks. extremely stressful.

I recently got tested know it. feel like even leave house contribute spread able look mirror more. 

But stay home I'm alone, cant chat friends more, they're hanging outside real life. I'm alone home I'm alone leave. see anyone wearing masks more, even cashiers, wear chin. go large grocery store one mask. feel like I'm actually Twilight zone episode, like I'm completely lose start yelling streets ""People, doing, know there's pandemic going on?!"". 

It's like hang stupid people. I'm familiar activist groups town, environmental activists, LGBTQ+ activists, mental health speakers, health care workers. going lives usual. I'm constantly seeing Instagram stories large camping trips, bar videos, people care free mask free. literally know single person right takes pandemic seriously. Okay, that's exactly true. know doctors front lines know serious. least them. nearly them, enough. went get tested, half people clinic wearing masks (I'm talking doctors). Even nurse took blood sample wearing one entering room blood sample taken. 

People treat like child, like know anything fact insane. Sometimes think maybe am. continue path self quarantining social distancing I'm going end alone. trust anyone that. continue mindset can't trust anyone anymore. 

Now know 'the sunken place' feels like.

Sorry rant, needed vent, even text form strangers, even one reads it. back movies video games. taking rushed vacinee notice Antibodies fade, tests moderately useful. Using IFR current CDC estimate 0.65%, NY State 30% infected. Using previous CDC estimate 0.26%, NY State 66%. Either percent would large slowing effect transmission, 66% nearly complete stoppage 30% dropping R0 half. 

I‚Äôm sure masks ‚Äòshutdowns‚Äô (which never really happened) helped, main reason things slowed NY wood feeding fire running out. One need look Sweden, next nothing, also almost deaths week so. (I‚Äôm advocating Swedish model, seems disease peters Swedish levels social distancing) I've following r/coronavirusga week, incredible.

The school district justified photo basically saying need 15 minutes exposure catch covid, crowded hallways fine. school dealing outbreak football team. Elsewhere, one school district 260 employees quarantined exposure. Someone sent kid school waitiing test results. got test results back 2nd day class entire classroom quarantined. Parents posting stories children masks ripped bullies teachers forcing remove them.

This first week first area attempt reopening. like metro Atlanta virus well control point take lot risks. They're housing patients convention center hospital capacity strained. They're chicken leaders hiding behind ""power"". WIMPS. loose hankies fine. realize everyone going die, right? acting like we're fighting bubonic plague, disease 2% mortality rate. Lol what? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take responsibility all‚Äù Antibodies fade immunity read, something cells Whatever decision, good luck thank you! anybody shocked? think wife mentioned hospital quoted day, case influx tests. often returned faster. antibody test even much quicker swab test.  Well, stop testing sick people, numbers go down. Duh. /s Denial reality last resort conservative america. run plays always end plugging ears yelling ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù. even. like 30-50%[based last 15 particularly bad; CDC estimated 10% effectiveness. 

Still, vaccine easy get even 30% effective, that's still lot lives misery spared. get shot every year. Remote schooling workable. know good internet access, considerations made. many stay home, should. kids get sick, might lose semester whole school year, even die. makes carriers, bringing home families. schools able finish Spring semester remotely, different Fall semester? idiots fight this, longer takes. EU nations didn‚Äôt to, people smart enough it. UK best position Europe.

Norway low case numbers, able shut situation gets control, Sweden fuckton cases already circulation, Sweden hit harder winter Norway, difference Norway Sweden Norway choice, Sweden not. Sorry, wrong. prove long immunity lasts. don‚Äôt get state lasts longer ‚Äúbecause‚Äù. truth don‚Äôt know. Society already decided best course action prevent spread virus might well get board that‚Äôs plan. Northern California, teacher friend wife‚Äôs told us district‚Äôs plan teacher death literally ‚Äúwe plant tree name bench honor.‚Äù response deal trauma students? ‚ÄúWe move quickly possible it‚Äôs traumatic.‚Äù It‚Äôs sad fast went ‚Äúteachers heros! don‚Äôt know everyday‚Äù beginning pandemic ‚Äúget back work, trash!‚Äù

Also, district, someone district office got it. Prior, asked going safety protocols, sent CDC guidelines (I believe was). Welp. Part guidelines sent said everyone exposed positive person get tested, quarantine 14 days. response close one day. *One* day cleaning. Getting tested optional. district can‚Äôt even follow guidelines, they‚Äôre going fucked. We‚Äôre thankful since lucky enough put state‚Äôs watch list it‚Äôll back online learning. churches part HATED science.  

Thankfully, always got trouble folks. 

Stay safe. think don‚Äôt want people eating bleach. tell surfaces vector, might start bleaching putting disinfectant food unsafe ways.

Because we‚Äôre idiots.  religious people read Genesis story metaphorical account includes Big Bang evolution. person proposed Big Bang theory, Georges Lema√Ætre, Catholic priest. Catholic Church, world‚Äôs largest Christian denomination, doesn‚Äôt insist literal reading Genesis, neither number Protestant denominations. Lots Jews don‚Äôt read literal account.

But doesn‚Äôt make terribly interesting news story. It‚Äôs kind like ‚Äúman doesn‚Äôt bite dog‚Äù story. priests, ministers, rabbis might talk evolution sermons, don‚Äôt spend much time talking evolution deniers do. People believe religion evolution compatible aren‚Äôt going protest evolution taught schools- would they?

The creationists constructed identity believing evolution important part. It‚Äôs central religious people‚Äôs beliefs identities. It‚Äôs Experts predicting NYC center pandemic growth decades. Population density, international/national travel city level poverty there. serious factors taken account pandemic. Even include probable deaths, NYC 23k deaths population 8.4 million within city. even add 0.3%.

And 22 million people NYC metro area, many sought care city, driving rate zero deaths many consecutive days radius appropriate restrictions loosen? what's benchmark? alive ultimately serious underlying medical condition. Good info. ready straight call bullshit. fucking way 5k cases day REALLY?! THEY... DON'T... KNOW?! claim academic type, can't figure out?! live area ""smart"" people. So, let guess -- could one following?! Protests, riots, reopening happening time, mainly younger people?! maybe people infected symptoms, known asymptomatic, cause 40% infections. forget people refuse wear masks. Like State Washington, Mask Order Governor, see anybody wearing go walking around neighborhood around city. ones see wear old people going grocery store early morning. Take pick ""smart"" people, happening country. Don‚Äôt go shopping Texas. Plenty people LOVE bring whole family shopping half wearing masks half caring Haven‚Äôt heard? bro. yeah rest nation totally burning /s Well annoyed named that, America centric since got big. beginning plenty news countries developments, there's still important articles.. man, Americans give 2 shits either 5 times news article European teacher dying covid either üòÖ 

Wish bit better balanced. wrong reddit American centric general. Bury head sand more, ya 22% infected, 29% needed herd immunity, NYC almost side thing, public policy. Stfu goalposts. ü§´ understanding cannot federal law would state state law similar seatbelts. States make law legally cannot done federally. idea forcing schools open closed. also prerogative state. NY Cuomo made clear throughout US government make choices them. regard government also cant reverse mask mandates made Twitter fingers gonna heated Never saw coming deadlines unpaid leave already past many districts. districts waited leave deadline reveal plans. districts US still don‚Äôt final plan, least haven‚Äôt released final plan. watch YouTube PR videos School Board meetings hope knowing management planning.

I ready start making demands June, local union prefers exhaust negotiation options, first. We‚Äôre supposed report work week, one answer whether that‚Äôs remote person, guess knowing whether actually staff schools isn‚Äôt important people charge. Death threats hillbillies incoming aka conservatives non US citizen looking interview, can‚Äôt even put words cringe worthy was, honestly felt like watching 2 10 year olds debating best toy car collection.
Props interviewer could kept composure like did, would feel ass laughing  think people 40 underlying medical condition two. I'm even 40 couple.

Age 40 also protected group legally allowed discriminate against. 

So people disabilities, though know many disabilities type make one vulnerable virus.

These laws created protect vulnerable encourage equality. point able agree vulnerable minority make anyone less deserving consideration treated like human.

Pretty sure virus fatal &lt;insert people would feel lot comfortable calling every single denier incredible bigot, are. famous local gin distillery, bottle describes hand sanitizer full botanicals. thing find bottle tells rebranded gin hand sanitizer get around taxes ""hydrogen peroxide"" tiny letters ingredients.

Everything smell feel seems like gin. viscous all. open per national guideline get federal funds district. 

if close day #2, still get funds.  politics stupid often not. Thing Spanish Flu actually deadly fun Brazilians health care workers left. Awesome! hard hell y‚Äôall fought good fight, won. dont know NY greatest example fight pandemic. NYS responsible 30,000 150,000 deaths country. man celebrated. right either societal collapse just, depressing always wonder people sit write death threat send someone. bizarre. Herd immunity thing doesn‚Äôt require 100%. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è place got MBA accredited on-line option. think it‚Äôs pretty common master least, idea undergrad Show tell. way get done.  right this.

The many governments fucked big time lying usefulness masks. affected credibility. 

They encouraged people use homemade masks.

On hand, people fuckin stupid wear masks, especially governments came clean. True! agree, that's weird. many kinds test many municipalities, hard know available they're using. Airports use 2-hour tests, they're available there, anyway. takes asymptomatic kid doctor? seems like peaked half north done. HMU ur ever right Trying kid middle pandemic economic climate collapse horizon..... sound rational???? 

Man oh man....really beyond screwed. guess people don‚Äôt see writing wall.... Here's latest case/death chart Houston (Harris strange movements stats, presumably reporting issues.

Compare New York Agreed 100%. another article quite 5% world's population, yet represent 20-25% world's infections ... mean, worst. worst?"" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked Fauci interview. 

This one election issue everyone - media individual voters alike - demands accounting for. Every news outlet individual screaming acceptable.  look New York now

Arguably worst place earth COVID cases last 6 months? Cohen kind idiot, I've noticed, Cooper appears threading needle safety revolt state legislature. Wolf PA governor Wisconsin tried save lives, despite best efforts state legislature get everyone exposed time. This, much. 8 year old asthma apparently life isn‚Äôt value according people. reading comments local news site (always mistake) child died, amount comments blowing disturbing. Someone even said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs nature taking care itself‚Äù something along lines. understand anyone disgusting heartless. Underlying medical issues mean someone isn‚Äôt worthy living.  first one third one make sense sound reasonable

Not context. ""live fear"" cars, go carelessly walking traffic either. Taking sensible precautions living fear. fact, less stupid health less need worry it. ""trusting God"" argument. shoot foot willingly walk cliff trust God going save you. ""Don't idiot"" still applies.

People need human interaction though, we're fortunate enough ability social interaction remotely point human history. People video chat anyone including therapist need it. desire socializing terms justify endangering health/lives others. I‚Äôm catholic reminds bit Jews damning Jesus death cross.

‚ÄúFather, Forgive Them, Know Do‚Äù That‚Äôs meant. Also meant number deaths cases going Wow, measly percentage points less contraction Eurozone average, took needless deaths thousand people! Well, plan .....commit piracy states try profiteer bunk treatments. Oh meant plan mitigating virus .... yeah plan that. corrupt certainly smart think holds candle guys terms dumb. state got wrecked hurricane knew right play federal assistance even meant photo ops President Obama. risking lives help others.  deserve way pay getting.  Could increase domestic violence Stop posting then, lunatics! electors electoral college vote interests people America vote interests? embarrassment. respect. Sweden üá∏üá™ quit forced sterilizations already 2013.

I also bit sceptical people go cruises surely sterilized! 

But maybe better authorities ban cruises altogheter vaccine available. 
I mean, can't people wait six months start crusing again? Shut you‚Ä¶ Go look statistics CDC.gov. kills non-whites disproportionately. no, wrong republicans. Republicans saying masks don‚Äôt work, businesses need open, schools need open. haven‚Äôt figured agenda point, fucking moron.Do call foolish calling observations five-year-old could see open eyes paid attention I‚Äôll give benefit doubt you‚Äôre uninformed reality. Sorry hear that, hope things getting better still happiness teachers old MILFs completely understand saying. another side to,this coin well. Ok, schools closed for,the duration. ? one parents gets unemployed ? single parent household work ? end? work nurses would waste Florida. Part complete breakfast forgot massive deficits education well. problem part left dealing much Coronavirus.  ""I want deny medical care someone agree actions."" us Belgians keep going wear facemasks everywhere? actual long term side effects swine flu? would love know would explain things life. got 2009, things never same. No, know virus roll regardless agendas. aren‚Äôt stopping either way.

That mask isn‚Äôt sealed. virus smaller particulate masks rated for. nothing virus.

You people like family exposed corona less 10 times single cough fever. person near ever shown issues nearly 70 year old mom emphysema COPD. tested positive corona. fever, flu like symptoms never even coughed once. Made fine. people aren‚Äôt dying corona, they‚Äôre dying corona. Atleast personal experience. I‚Äôve told seen tv. 

My children staying mother came fever. picked person already Rona. issues whatsoever. either genetically dominant virus immune beings, or.... 

Who knows. also work 50 people exposed many times me, issues.

I think I‚Äôll keep agenda. may everyone, I‚Äôm living rock rest life spraying cereal Lysol. couple common thoughts thread.

1. Arrest/fine people attend

2. Deny medical care attend.

And ideas getting upvoted. Also disinfect seat. trust someone else keep safe. Agreed. took break days several rude people. realise got people sick past. likely never gave much thought past spread flu viruses about. That's life. caused illness before, like us all. 

Don't go barbers go. matter. matter posting online trying inflate ego make hero getting haircut. Nobody cares. Nobody outside echo chamber is. imagine wedding tied several connected covid deaths? Every wedding anniversary also memorial. smart get rid hygiene time like this. ‚ÄúFuriously googles Clorox stock price‚Äù Perfect number open schools, apparently Well, makes sense:

They started precoutionary measure, new research points contact surfaces route infection.

Question interest: reported infection happened √≠n airplane? not, seems wearing mask, combination ventilation system safe enough. Well I‚Äôm dual citizen there‚Äôs that. (Father Belgian). root Belgium US. idiot..have lost anyone disease? Well haven‚Äôt lucky. teachers older risk family members risk..in person school dead better get used it. Never heard before. Perhaps left open container? better open er up! funny cuz think arrest? Stockholm hospitals used rapid tests, would make 10% Stockholm‚Äôs total number tests week 31. doubt 2-3x halved deliveries, could wrong. find ""current estimates""? what? crime go party. I'm pretty sure that, like woman Bunnings incident, actually want government legal system suits them.

So yes, believe they're entitled flout rules government imposes yet still access government funded healthcare. 1000 Sources that? Interested reading seems clear spreading longer realised, reports found waste water dating back parts last year (November 2019), scans patients Italy France. Good news! live America! former always going abundant! decades huh?  someone dresses police officer goes around demanding 150 euro fines everyone without mask?

Free market forces work.

But jokes aside, police officers identifiable per ID impersonating one crime. Yeah sure, know labs. update mouth guards face masks too. 
(I wish way teach Google translate translation improvements. problem ""k√∂n"" too, supposed queue sometimes translates sex gender. Ha ha). ""jesus"" imaginary, expiration date not, unfortunately. This! bro priest spouts nonsense. obvious worried money!  10% death rate? Where? Planes get washed every 3 months particularly brazen. must misunderstanding it. Russia bad, see 80s 90s action movies? wish could great person like you, really love wear mask display perceived morality instead actually carrying moral action. Thank also taking time write comment shows great are. 

How act every flu season before? I'm starting worry like every person world, carried day like normal. would think amazing people like more. wear mask visor every previous flu season? lock away refuse see family entirety winter/spring? Please let know, obviously answers want bad person whilst true heros like roam around saving world. Money goes politicians pockets rich assholes get want. world works unfortunately. Teachers wanna chill home üòÇ don‚Äôt like teaching, find another job lulz Health safety theatre, pretend everything could claim ""bad things happened nobody expected responsible for."" Dick Branson thing. Uh... train hundreds thousands dogs, that, train thousands trainers. see problem? fuck gonna hundreds thousands dogs? Who's gonna take care them? Feed them, walk them, etc? Working dogs need trained handlers, hundreds thousands dogs means hundreds thousands people take care dogs.

Or... make test kits, rather relying something sounds like dreamed 300 years ago. Take award sign times, cared affected  signal incorrect much time. Many times people want get sick cautious. Even 20 years ago wore N95 P100 masks every time got plane. idea passengers thought sick, wasn't. thought wrong. completely ridiculous. defeats purpose two groups overlap. teaching person group home group time?  Beat Coronavirus one weird trick American's hate! I'll honest I've never really liked ohio... all. France Brazil, don‚Äôt know one worse Wow, Chinese propaganda really something sub. open.

Even tests 99.9% accurate, critical, necessary-to-sustain-life healthcare systems/organizations/businesses would far good daily testing early-warning detection. like many testing kits going bad idle labs going shut lack work.

20-40K tests *every single day* theme park good use limited testing resources (especially since taking days weeks get back rapid tests less accurate); theme park open pandemic also good idea/good use resources. happen ago? math work ? Sounds like someone tickling stats CNN. iNmuNItY mAy lAsT twO mOntHS

I reading shit since day 1. people want think way, nothing them. Cmon hurts Sorry I‚Äôve become really bad trying get rise people. don‚Äôt know why, think world gone nutz helpless.  quick. Juuuul CNN yesterday, analysis U.N., one billion students school. 50 students COVID case. Imagine economy depend kids warehoused guise ""education"". I'm worried certain permanent damage widespread. literally illegal ignore scientific evidence like could self-organize, brainstorm improve system much do. Even importantly, old cases need better data. Call recovered ask happened. No. error margin exactly every day. 2nd test new indicator, can't use confirm earlier test, except quarantaine. Good! Could quickly test e.g. airplane load people get board? least fined significantly. Yeah know. Somebody reported today though. Sorry mate. Right? We‚Äôre twice two months ago, people pleased? Clorox wipes standard kid‚Äôs supply list years. wonder can‚Äôt keep schools reopening amidst pandemic. Changed North Carolina already sooo many cute designs Japan SK.
Back pandemic started friend sent Sanrio one japan. Soooo cute right misspoke, fact nobody cell antibodies starting point immune system truly matter, thing seems random genetic factors determine fast rapid develope antibodies. really crapshoot, yes immune-compromised disadvantage comes outcomes there's really difference normal person health nut. adaptability starting point like something Cell memory like Flu. see one would like stay home forever. Thank you. 
Just stay safe, whole lot you. remote learning concern contracting season flu kills children several times covid-19. measures clearly aimed protecting parents, children. that? someone want play rules, person get goodies society. someone plays fast loose people's lives tend get golden tickets prison--not free reign shopping sprees.

The result policy suggested would they'd spread COVID19 store people would need clean rooms get home. ""its... uh... type bacteria, everyone said that"" Maybe use New Jersey making comparisons want ""Sweden fared worst""-narrative, given New Jersey like 15800 deaths (with 8.8 million people) compared 5700 Sweden. I‚Äôm going wear masks foreseeable future. work security long public transport journeys work. I‚Äôm exposed sorts. 
I tonsillitis debilitated 3 days symptoms weeks after. Would rather either way. wanted ask. paranoid?

My dad, who's 50+ diabetic high BP decided get haircut

Issue that, I've seen many barbers touching outside masks stuff here

Don't know specific shop want, change gloves glove box everytime start cut someone's hair , make customers wear plastic instead fabric gowns

Is enough risk? family also refuses buy thermometers oximeters there's way know o2 levels go low temps go high  saw someone saying coronavirus bad 500K people die heart diseases every year. coronavirus could've prevented Trump actually done anything people listened Seems country based. issue Canada. many fucking vacation days people feel like can't stay put year? Jesus Christ ridiculous. Regarding think US already surpassed Sweden terms deaths per US excess death 190k(from march 15 july 18).
Adjusted covid deaths per capita would 579 deaths/mil. US reports 75% excess deaths covid covid deaths per capita currently 564 deaths/mil. Sweden records 101% excess deaths covid source: [Tracking Real Coronavirus Death Toll United news today source: [35% excess deaths pandemic caused article: *According Prof. Woolf: ‚ÄúThere several potential reasons under-count. may reflect under-reporting; takes data come in. cases might involve patients COVID-19 died related complications, heart disease, complications may listed cause death rather COVID-19.‚Äù* Yup mean decades since [Yazoo land numbers.

\- Majority humanity. :( think bit overstating costs here.

1/ definitely milions dollars health care expenses Norway. Maybe US healthcare bill, sure.

2/ healthcare workers well aware keep safe necessary PPE Norway

3/ Norway's healthcare system \*\*not\*\* overloaded never close overloaded pandemic.

All would sound left-leaning, right-leaning countries seen work practice:

- Send recently graduated doctors mandatory ‚ÄúHelp Treat America‚Äù Project whereby rural town receives top-notch clinician free 1-year; return, doctor receives pay sponsored high federal subsidy. Many rural towns need doctors due pay gap city vs rural, untenable unless legislation made stop inequality; unfortunately, market unable this, hurting Americans, end.

- Ensure fiber optic internet available rural communities; large downside rural home-based businesses unreasonable online world (reliable internet alone bigger turn rural business life isolation, shipping, infrastructure challenges; internet, growth)

- Freedom Dividend $1000 month every Americans; lack opportunity, create opportunity. Rural Americans poor they‚Äôre stupid, cash poor they‚Äôre uneducated, fault exchange providing families community collapses around them. peoples crafty, brilliant, resourceful, publicly-educated, connected America‚Äôs fiber being.

- Create American Exchange Program, send high school seniors around country go live one year rural areas; exchange, rural high schooler go suburban urban high school.

I many, many ideas stop haha Isn‚Äôt e rest world excluding Brazil, India USA pretty much this? embarrassment makes anyone think schools close virus spreading schools? aren‚Äôt closing anything else virus spreading. I‚Äôm asking genuine question here. think schools close? We'll see happens. I'm expert.  right they're calling 71 year old Dad contract work factories. wears mask now. people arguing unessential businesses like Disney World understand- masks social distancing mitigating risks, eliminating them. Influencer culture really needs die. Absolute waste space people Nursing already induces fatigue depression long hours night shifts.

Also, again, Norway supposed safe. Hindsight 20/20 back June reopened seem likely happen.  today's 55% exhibiting brain damage.

Bulldoze? even remotely based reason? many people need suffer die people revolt? conclusion article based subjective accounts, polling data. suspect India's large income inequality, slum areas poor hygiene, large households extended families, low education levels high levels corruption average Indian never chance. 15 coming state government school districts?

My state bottom far cases (around 1400), yet district giving students option fully remote. I'm sure working supply internet it, though. bigger quantity idiots. Yeah, exactly estimated 1000 per week limit, unlikely 2-3x more. Well, Norway seems publish numbers 25th August Denmark published yet, go ahead. can't help laugh. European here. antivax?

Those Kiwis keep making America look foolish examples common sense leadership.

Keep mind 78% patients mild symptoms, including asymptomatic, showed heart damage. Today new article released 55% mild patients brain damage.

I even risk mild patient. risk. Den yet released figures IIRC. know week old live New Zealand back 100% normal (barring international travel), pretty significant lockdown period couple months ago. benefit tiny island nation far anyone else you‚Äôre looking real 100% normal it! need masks social distancing anymore, though culture shifted bit people still somewhat social distancing public. 

Just keep people around safe, it‚Äôs really asking much you. Almost every western country invested hundreds billions spring get numbers down. must let mentally challenged people waste investment. ‚ÄùFew percentage points‚Äù putting mildly.

Oh no! maybe it‚Äôll make big pharm ton money nothing. It‚Äôs still surprise! author look things Swedens economy. 

It's basically saying like 80% region industry home office ""that region affected"".

People died smaller sectors affected virus got hit well. think Volvo gets parts cars example, oh right countries shutdown... countried early year probably underreported 30% 50%.

Because deaths counted COVID-19, example older people dying nursing homes.

In many countries, year-to-year comparisons number dead shows people died official Covid-19 dead count. still took hit. Sweden one highest mortality rates world. It‚Äôs death toll seems low Sweden 10,000,000 people, less New Jersey fucking nightmare end? lot death. It‚Äôs good thing hundreds thousands children families. cruel thing say. They‚Äôre human beings text subjects children say matter protect lives. much lockdowns all. Worthwhile read. Maybe Trump return NY since Cuomo asked nicely? Great work.. work season 4 `The Almighty Johnsons`. Well guess lot countries schools still summer brake makes perfect sense. check going protest without mask? would hate see guy checks gas leak home. I... You... Um...

I person responding to, strong feeling conversation... compare Spain, Italy EU whole instead Scandinavian countries like Norway Denmark? Day late dollar short point. America, thought maybe police hand around school events account school shootings something. that‚Äôs nutritionist, real doctor mask wearing seem problem with, social distancing another 2-3 years vaccine found that's rubbing people wrong way. think Abe cabinet wanted Olympics happen badly, try tried ignore virus. want turn around admit wrong. probably want lose tourist dollars Olympics postponed year Well curious existing data rapid tests may already market. example know ones used US White House rather inaccurate. Dutch cities Amsterdam Rotterdam Thursday ordered wearing face masks busy places including capital's famed red light district order limit spread coronavirus.

The move comes despite Dutch public health authorities saying Wednesday still enough evidence effectiveness masks warrant nationwide order.

The Netherlands one last holdouts along Nordic nations widespread use masks, many European nations imposed tougher rules wearing face coverings. work said overseas? 

It good PR say America helping countries. Chinese sending sorts PPEs stuff overseas. show something well. Whether useful Brazilians relevant. So... choosing dumb dumb otherwise intelligent co-worker refuses use anything common sense regarding covid-19. common sense says old people get virus, that's he'll believe, ignoring facts suggest otherwise. need get granular here? reality anti-intellectualism exists South, COVID COVID. Note pointing group anti-intellectual necessarily strictly saying dumb, stupid (though personal opinion, it‚Äôs pretty dumb actively anti-intellectual.)

TLDR, You‚Äôre defending group people label many willingly accept. Died home. Looks nervously CAQ. I'm gonna go limb say maybe egregious? seems like groups far enough apart one another, general air turbulence volume help, we've seen massive gatherings beaches FL Europe, also protests outdoors perhaps even less social distancing, though I've seen, mask compliance.

It would concerning small circles contained people mixing different households, sitting close together extended periods time without masks. possible lower number would enough long distancing masking place. 60%+ would required drop precautions, one afford right now. original claim OP (who originally replied to) ""the south fucking stupid"" incorrect.

That's facts. Obviously everyone, majority. Several people saying ""old news"", ""we already discovered mutation back May, dominant strain since then"" (basically saying ""this pandemic""). Let explain claims misleading.

First off, study article referencing released July 17th

Second: Yes, discovered strain back May. saw hardened spike protein potentially infectious assumed dominant strain spreading throughout world. However, science work like that. Studies done prove claims. studies would also take months 6,000 mutations Sars-Cov-2 across half dozen different variants. order map spread, incredibly complex computer simulations needed created, assumptions created results matching actual outbreak worldwide. [July study released. shown first second figures study, G strain responsible major outbreaks seen Italy, France, Spain, UK. early March spread New York. month March New York went 0-59,000 cases hospitals overwhelmed. outbreak spread northeastern states like New Jersey, Michigan, etc. also major outbreak Mardi Gras New Orleans hurt South.

By end March G variant made 90% cases Northeast, 70% cases South, 50% cases West Midwest. Today makes 70% total cases worldwide. Make mistake it, variant New York hit hard early on, states, refused lockdown, never saw rush patients. huge implications means rural communities immediate danger strain spreads them.

The actual infectiousness took months study too. ones showing much infectious really started coming last 2 weeks. strain, ""old news"". current news big deal.

""Opening schools best thing kids. also best thing working families,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Friday.""

Dont get cold feet now. current White House famous following science profit. I'm sure friends family fine. still said downsides are, that's worse death, letting children back schools early without plan place. I'm sure well versed science behind unlike rest us.

You can't. People flying damn country lol. sensible country world would full national lockdown weeks ago. new Zealand watching everyone US completely ignore travel around like normal absurd lol. Ya'll locked home legit weeks 13 deaths Sweden like 430 deaths US. terrible well. also add already looking axe football together probably speed process Well, make sense.  also want Yale resume pull get it.

Hot take: lose many students state schools money. compare Sweden US. strategy might best, least wasnt circlejerk shitfest US facing currently.

I know school implemented social distancing, masks mandates follow CDC's guidelines. sure whether school report done recommendations. line Karl Fristin saying countries need compared. NJ districts least working hard create socially distant environment.

My kids' school alternating day schedule school split two groups.

Group goes Monday, B goes Tuesday, goes Wednesday, etc.

It cuts classroom size half makes easier keep distance. dogs 100% success rate. Others not. Actually, 1000% don‚Äôt want things go back exactly way before. would travesty waste people paid lives for: societal change.

After bubonic plague 13th century, serf system largely swept away. Instead essentially slaves, farm workers able negotiate far better terms favor lords. 

Why? two-thirds fewer serfs. landlords owned land serfs farmed *needed* them, nobody ate.

Every plague silver linings. strongly suspect someone getting money scheming. Or, wants destroy public education order establish feudal system. jealous? Go nursing school. Every respiratory pandemic modern era large spike winter. Coronaviruses seasonal influenza viruses.

There absolutely reason think would different. is!    eye roll I'd interested know poor kid family members tested. agree child reason tested, wait results going school? Widely available rapid testing would helpful! hate republicans. know. message sent time. Sorry. [It‚Äôs exactly Reddit wouldn‚Äôt let post yahoo version. article pretty much says ‚Äúbusiness usual‚Äù students returning school. paywalled Lol yeah right. grocer paid $2/hr hazard pay ended June 1 still provide sick pay leave. use vacation days get sick.

Is based anything guess? Genuinely curious. know much fatigue recovering it. Well it‚Äôs kid it‚Äôs uterus. don‚Äôt care natural stillbirths. really care fetus.

I think real dips...it's reporting logistics. words...not every case death reported immmediately happens. looking daily data, may make sense rollup data weekly periodicity remove false variation/noise data. What‚Äôs difference touching shirt touching face, touching mask touching face? Lol can't ever anything person agian huh. Awesome.

I‚Äôm stay home mom. parents jobs going make work?? say cancel semester hold kids back half year. even full year. Call wash. people get test results quickly? 

My friend New York wait 10 days test available. Ah makes sense - yeah let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs not! fucking forgot drive lol. Come heard least one doctor saying may possible lethal form mostly burned leaving less dangerous strains roam freely.

That one explanation. Another 4-5 months later lots people experiment figure treat stock drugs equipment. That's probably main reason California, Florida Texas seeing nearly many deaths New York New Jersey did. don‚Äôt know flirt online? Pretty sure do. bet recovering function within year two.

Nah, keep indefinitely, it‚Äôs hard stay away people one thing really bugs me. sort understand (I think...) set massive distrust issue.

Unfortunately, take time figure answers. can't learn last mistakes better Well yes science made using actual stats... thats standard response science statistics understand fucking stupid much US population gotten.

If want lock house wear mask forever you‚Äôre free so. rest us moving ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù. amazes people little common sense. Generally pandemics like unreported deaths 3-5 times actual deaths.

Much safer (politically) reopen schools, recite ‚Äúwe following CDC‚Äôs guidelines,‚Äù close weeks later following outbreak ask ‚Äúwho could predicted this?‚Äù Imagine looks like business' parents work at. long employers even rentals start screening people school aged kids; they'll risk around, even precautions taken. may legal, really matter much; something would hard prove. huh? support people guns? I'm english use one 

if everyone street one might reconsider however go. Schools current pandemic offer commodity order compete charter schools, private schools socially distance, online schools. assuring students stay district, schools assuring funding stays district. Even schools inevitably close, convinced parents keep kids district proverbial teat time being. It‚Äôs rather deceptive. 

I feel schools would done better create robust online learning communities compete established online schools say ""it is"" lot. yes, basically same. problem results times takes two weeks get Stock Market completely unbound GDP (as news past week shown) reality (you observe phenomenon lunar cycles, look closely). Numbers go Important Numbers Go Up. Numbers going means everything good nobody panic. Sometimes Numbers go little bit, wait know they'll back going again, higher ever before. Personally, think Numbers still going last human finally dies, subreddit religious discussion. keep saying things like ""well NY still highest death toll!"" nothing months warning half many deaths something proud of. husband teacher, father elementary student.. quite concerning :( realize death rate 0.5% majority 60 yrs older right? Complete shutdown economy never get rid coronavirus. Even China pandemic longest draconian shutdown, still outbreaks opened up. 

Keep schools closed, parents can‚Äôt go back work. Hope guys understand implications collapsed tax base. Masks home? going happen. We‚Äôve seen photos kids aren‚Äôt wearing masks school. 

Anyway, teachers staff? happens cycles them? need list all, call servant-martyrs, much concise encompasses groups. funny thing kids pretended wash hands went motions washing hands without actually washing hands. Failure... country absolute failure depends. criminal negligence, statute directly point. Also negligence usually civil thing. way, intro negligence incoming.

One legal duty care. Second breach significant enough, breach. airlines example, properly warns everyone multiple stages changes, enforces rules, kicks people break them, fill airplane 1/2 capacity, properly spaces everyone out, everyone mandated wear face mask, flight attendants wearing gloves, filters/fan getting extra maintenance put extra high, possibly more, airlines say, warned you, saw rules fairly enforced, made changes reduce risk. probably enough get legally hook. say, legal duty prevent infections (impossible really), minimize risk took risk, upheld end bargain made changes. due dilligence. airlines going careful. hopefully informative.

As State federal governments.. Soveriegn immunity. Jesus fucking christ...this fucking hate kids. really amazes many people don‚Äôt understand stupid good portion population is. Case point: 63 million people voted Trump. awesome! I'm ex-NYC resident lives Rochester. Here's concern though-- fuck reopening schools September affect progress?

I'm teacher. students ages 3 6. husband trying get pregnant. reopening person classes many co-workers.

My biggest question take risk??? Cases still prevalent many areas.

I million points could made I'd like hear opinions people subreddit matter. actually written Florida constitution. Public employees right strike.

http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A1S06  understand heavily implied. Considering prevalence virus states, I'd agree. priority address first. 

But countries, re-opened schools May-June saw decreasing trend cases (and reached low enough threshold cases per 100,000 inhab.) see major flare due school re-opening particular. I'm fighting like hell. audacity say COVID valid reason get housing. absolutely ridiculous. I'M IT! able take everything online. [The Yale 30 billion dollars. idea Yale needs charge less 6000 undergrad students money pay janitor pretty ridiculous. think asking people voluntarily make families homeless, basis future homelessness may dangerous, unreasonable standard truckloads testing. Locked hard long. Friend mine motorbike tour Northern Italy. far reports adherence hygiene measures high. Everything I've read says likely least 70% needed herd immunity. That's pretty significant. lot cases, hard believe 3/4 population contracted virus. \*sigh\* 


I live Florida. School starts 2 weeks.  


The county offering high quality virtual option well person school.  


According authorities, 80% parents choosing person school.  


I give six weeks, max.  


My kids safe home. Stop denying science treating Covid death sentence healthy people 60. Depends district, part, person instruction ""options"" students virtual get fever, positive test results, parents want work home. It‚Äôs August 5th. school opening year early? Probably reddit echo chamber appears understanding much robust people read invested enough comment posts taking correct precautions. paying much go Yale parents probably pretty well off. Ivy League schools give need based assistance ass. Show us going away looks like. Resign take underlings you. This.

It's sad people died. Especially families people.

But anyone actually looked anticipated life expectancy places? good.

Additionally, others pointed out, patients caught nursing home first place. Deaths lagging indicator. case counts. keep going cycle:

Losing pension huge veteran teachers suffered bullshit 15-20 years already... losing teaching certificate big deal too. hope strike would effective creating chaos system teachers would able negotiate back, it‚Äôs huge risk state little safety net begin with. Exactly. Like say ""it is"" influence regular person little. best radically accept whatever happening ""it is"" otherwise I'll go insane. 

If lots influence national response president say ""it is""-that's best. respond, go media complaints.

What old people always calling ""media"" (aka local newspaper) complaints? going good.

For instance, seen mention news study controlled gender. already know women less likely catch disease, least part they're better following pandemic best practice like wearing mask. Height strongly correlated gender, tall people catch disease more. honestly understand takes long I've reading, 2 months ago riding ambulance way ER asked okay tested covid, said yes course. Maybe like halfway (5 minutes later) call hospital giving vitals crap overheard say covid test negative hospital. Maybe they're different tests... knows Seems like reasonable solution kill landlords first link say need take zinc act ace inhibitor, even part ones efficacy.

Actually, worse nothing. nothing, also actively fought masks. first point - bats chance hell would public health authority allow happen. 

To second point - non-expert understanding first point looking plausible. may grouping related coronavirus provide T-cell cross-reactivity already wide spread population. forgot numbers like HCoV-HKU1 handful them. means meaningful percentage population may much lower risk infection.

Are ignorant stupid?  let dogs out...again? Probably series events lead hitting ground. Kinda like heath complications mentioned getting covid. 

He listed Top 3 conditions people die from, combined 3.....but nah covid right? 14... That's nonsense stance. Unless ready broad travel ban, travel bans nothing. lot worst effected countries snap bans travel china. got europe US. 

The nature disease actions month late takes long get enough people sick justify level action. countries shut travel unless know sure bad. time italy demonstrated bad month late. majority cases came people visiting US returning home.

As responses go, Canada average countries like south korea beating comprehensively due good automated contact tracing good quarantine measures.

The mask thing based lack data worries mask supply. situation new virus, data recommendation change weighted cost. new cases Dalian... second wave hitting multiple countries, looks like effective method contain virus good nuke place testing.

Edit: /s (just case someone trips over) low zero. correct number cases Florida dig? drove past local farmers market 100+ people one wearing one. Shortly drove past park lake story.  think 'Stay fit America' movement would good good near vaccine-less year 6 months

It would invariably prevent COVID deaths, importantly would reduce mortality heart disease, cancer, stroke, save country billions dollars.

A lockdown pandemic *great* time governments encourage citizens eat healthier exercise. That's good idea! Thankfully happen much us, step kids' mom rolls eyes covid masks, awful part. authority Denmark handles infection tracing, Swedish Board Patient Safety, investigating causes behind local outbreaks.

One could make lot funny jokes one I'll settle suspect there's something iffy translation here, read original. Maybe authority Denmark though.. stay house. order groceries online pick outside store. wont get it. dont visit friends family. thats it. difficult exactly right plus add highest rate smoking. essentially impossible prove someone caught virus.

US try sometime. Kayleigh, better facts counter negative facts? It‚Äôs funny think figure got it, contact points. magical thinking. Couldn‚Äôt plane, like fly, must somewhere else! there's also false notion two (often extreme) sides every issue. ‚ÄúWhatchu readin‚Äô for?‚Äù We, collectively country, decided children matter anymore Newtown anything. :(  *known* cases. Since testing dogs, alive dead, almost meaningless. one would notice country lost 100,000 dogs. EMTALA law, illegal hospital bed deny acceptance patient need higher level care one available.

Shuts people real quick. fact can't comprehend something others scary. wearers much spreading anyone else case showing signs. Same. pretty bad least wearing mask listen get sick.

It feels obvious one going happen. need stop using word recovery implies actual physical state exist many survivors. Even testing, take longer week get results back. It‚Äôs flu bro. Shut country didnt care dead kids sandy hook doubt anything really problem? touch mouth face. Sanitize &amp; wash hands flight. irony statement people northern states coming vacationing (you know ones already bad numbers first place) 

And people think south inbred white people annoying too. Us black people exist too. know used ignoring us whatever shithole state come yes live too

I could care less bunch entitled foreigners think America esp reason get half assed free shit government they‚Äôve pillaged countries long America thing too. 

/n military brat that‚Äôs unfortunate experience living overseas years shit overrated. European cities smell racist.

Schools across US. Schools Native American Reservations schools rural areas within old buildings poor ventilation hardly windows vastly different schools suburbs inner city. popular bill 21? It‚Äôs certainly social conservative legislation.

Social fiscally meaning pro-social programs spending. would agree Quebec financially less conservative rest Canada. real question many uninstall it. believe Trump scientist all? sound like uneducated one smh bet true. Tbh. seems like probable theme..also, (F) believes earth flat kind half-baked theologies many self-declared Christians apparently indoctrinated without understanding makes depressed.

Those verses pointing saved absolutely work like kind ""good-bad barter system"" start paperclip end trading house. point good *if good thinking exchange good behavior salvation past wrongs* (aka something good cancel something bad). 

But mean good works pointless; fact 2:14-19 
What good it, dear brothers sisters, say faith don‚Äôt show actions? kind faith save anyone? Suppose see brother sister food clothing, say, ‚ÄúGood-bye good day; stay warm eat well‚Äù‚Äîbut don‚Äôt give person food clothing. good do?  see, faith isn‚Äôt enough. Unless produces good deeds, dead useless.  someone may argue, ‚ÄúSome people faith; others good deeds.‚Äù say, ‚ÄúHow show faith don‚Äôt good deeds? show faith good deeds.‚Äù  say faith, believe one God. Good you! Even demons believe this, tremble terror. foolish! Can‚Äôt see faith without good deeds useless?

Simply faith God thing makes *worthy* saved (not works lest man boast...), claiming believe still evil/bad things demonstrates belief **has actually saved you**. warning pretty harsh: faith empty good makes one similar morality outright demons.

And elsewhere, Jesus 7:17, 20 
A good tree produces good fruit, bad tree produces bad fruit. ... Yes, identify tree fruit, identify people actions.

Further, Jesus specifically called people make effort good God given Parable Talents/Three Servants (Matthew 25:14-30). seems safe conclude God immensely displeased anyone paid nothing lip service.

While I'm here, also think many apparently also forgot verses see clear basis adopting mask wearing social distancing, make others feel safe 12:18

Let look interests, also interests others. Montana? love state. Montana always nice peaceful. hate it, literally everyone hates masks loves idea killing everyone region. Thank god live pretty much middle woods. I've made clear family I'm going near seeing long time cause careless dangerous could ever imagined agreed. we'd really look county county possible  also take word pilot fully licensed. Odd argument. 2020 wild ride, everyone else got woke. ended 2019 racist all, another virus wet market China y'know. like much, researched CCP, started feeling sorry everyday Chinese person turned hate anger coronavirus CCP. months pass Americans increasingly awful things day day, rednecks coughing others faces, religious people gathering Mega churches still months later end sight. dunno USA could get back good books. vote Democrat bring strict masks always worn laws another maybe month lockdown that's enforced police. Maybe America redeem itself. guys dun fucked 2020.... yank tourists loudly coming country also helping public opinion....

But stupid government letting flights cuz American tourists spend money.... sigh... 
So greed welfare nationals...

Which sucks cuz nearly got rid covid month ago back 30 - 50 new cases day... that's get tested possibly more. rubbish article. substitute ""Chinese troll"" Russian, Japanese, Indian, even American troll, article still make sense. 

As far anyone tell, Chinese secrete video tapes Trump Biden. nothing threaten either candidate with. I‚Äôve heard couple similar stories three old coworkers contracted working Covid unit late March/early April. thought normal fatigue coming back high stress environment sick. two seriously considering giving nursing terrified make medication mistake already come close so. third one already taken leave absence couldn‚Äôt remember get home one night. Quack ü¶Ü ""Numbers spelt letters. Like ""A million"". thought smart. could somehow spell letters numbers would great. think someday."" kids siblings different classes, tracing interactions happened Monday, kids take bus school, etc. number potentially exposed kids way higher one class. Maybe, numbers Q2 yet. hear coming later August. really though, says article he‚Äôs gonna stay open keep paying fines. City pull licenses forcibly shut down. increase healthy birth outcomes,

There hospital seen comprehensive studies say anomaly. Aww caring! Jesus, knew bought January everyone laughing simply know that. assumption. fact new virus simply data long term effects yet. comparable virus Sars-CoV-1 *does* cause long-term mental issues chronic fatigue syndrome post-recovery. What's point running phase 1 2 Canada CanSino already completed China published result Lancet?

Sounds like waste time me. Okay? Sitting 30bil anything them, community, future students. greed. literally never spend much money, interest generated it.

That saying. huh, til. always thought American kids went back September feel bad still justify knowingly willingly exposing people virus.  required get mess going hurt cause issues last option left wasted much time far many windows opportunity passed us get virus control.  combination covid19 flu season going make whole thing significantly worse sinking feeling mortality rate skyrocket result. Probably Alberta ;) 10k less last week time? always fake news ER room. Also Canadian - agree completely. economy actually trending upwards businesses finding creative solutions reopen keep workers employed, following social social distancing, wfh, mask policies, government providing payments unemployed everyone comply public health directives. USA would look northward follow example, rather pushing economy cliff callous disregard health safety. Tremendoussss don‚Äôt think Florida reporting statistics honestly. It‚Äôs politics. Literally wash hands eat, animals. That‚Äôs way easier trying disinfect literally every surface earth, effective look total number tests performed, clearly significant dip. got called communist supporting rules. 

If wearing mask pandemic communist, I‚Äôm Joseph fucking Stalin. I'd say risk way around. happens online learning reduced cost normalized everyone it? Given shoddy quality Chinese masks Chinese COVID tests

Did Canada *really* want inject shoddy quality Chinese vaccines? Never let crisis go waste. Also study group size 25. Far small make conclusion from. mentioned know exactly what's op trying do, see discussions point antimasque even though clear men higher case rate countries argued women home irrelevant. whichever logical fallacy sets argument face impossible prove Light up, light up! says much like weapon cancel women's basketball season, we'll news story worth discussing understand Yale works. already link details. median net cost someone whose parents make $65,000 per year $3,000. $65,000 $100,000 $6,000.

They amongst affordable colleges country people whose parents make $200,000 per year. Ivies are.

Their entire operating principle make sure continue best students attend, regardless ability pay. students, best, make lot money graduate donate huge amount. got endowment first place. gotten tests done enough time get results school started.  Every one cases preventable spread done that. makes sense. sharp drop happened someone misreported 8 hospitalizations vaccine injection. false news corrected CEO call hour later. lockdown supporters? still wants lockdown? lockdown get faster manageable numbers. Sweden many deaths struggling long DESPITE measures? germany visit Europapark, Heidepark etc. sweden's amusement parks CLOSED. gatherings 50 people either! great strategy... I'm sorry, way relevant correction statement comparison Madrid Stockholm? 2 weeks, still get sick immune system built response yet, still fucking problem whether like not.

If one build response, also going fucking problem nobody else get sick. appear perfectly healthy still immune system work right, fyi, never know get sick. context people hospital sick enough hospitalized covid19 bad? Everyone taken doctor's education, knew infected would develop encephalitis. 

That possible dispute. Although would impossible predict many % infected would eventually happen to, everyone knew would happen. 

The sociopathy industrial lords beyond disgusting.

Keep concentration low. 

As long virus concentration (also called titer titre) keeps rising, people unable combat virus reach brains. husband caught staph infection Delta plane back 2014. Planes fucking grossssss. They'll give fuck teachers/support staff walk out. It‚Äôs question American. It‚Äôs ~right~ type America. 

The way folks left die fucking disgusting. Sounds like good foreword handbook symptom got ass started exercising every day. went away week that. Turns out, sheltering place actually bad health Yep, did. downvoted bunch people day actually defended administration. Like, people still nothing, feds still nothing things magically change? Like lol, many people can't face reality. plan? still seem sitting no? 25 people ~250 attendees (about 150 campers 100 staff, article). That's infection rate 10%, *is* bit high.

I strongly suspect somebody *already* infected arrived, spread there.

The good news course kids resilient nearly immune affects virus...they'll recover fine. Many schools get May go back August. mean Fauci clearly said things unpopular right thing say though. works robust testing tracing place. isolating currently infected nothing can't prevent spread again. lockdown like hitting brakes - slow cases it‚Äôs going make virus die unless bring contact absurdly low level - one country planet able reach. 

You something actively fight spread like rapid testing, contact tracing really isolating actual sick people. places seen smaller post-lockdown outbreaks didn‚Äôt essentially wasted lockdown efforts. lack testing, wouldn‚Äôt surprised real number higher. Costs schools went steady %3-%5 every year even recession gone down. standard easy identify economic bubble. Similar markets right now, outright overvalued obvious reasons going waiting cause evonomic crash. school prices already WAY inflated. paid climbing wall can't use it, refund seems appropriate. look back life, realize gotten cushy government job could nothing, give raises, unfireable.  Plus govy jobs great bennies. Florida, I'm assuming. Post-viral fatigue often mixed depression, two extremely different (with biological evidence back now).

Post-viral fatigue used called ‚Äúyuppie flu‚Äù long time, it‚Äôs real disease (probably autoimmune) starting get serious research put past years minority long term become less reason, especially vaccine released.

Normally, govs read sentiment, if, go.  right gov here, passed welfare aid prior left gov, completely ideology. So... rewarded. left though, former wife lied get press. Here‚Äôs idea, perhaps start getting healthier track US? lot talk ‚Äòsocial mixing‚Äô masks antibodies little talk unhealthy major focus change going forward. hope health wellness overall lifestyle change become important topics handle going forward. There‚Äôs lot unpack people unhealthy, better time address it, no? trying spitshine turd. People read, think point largely irrelevant. Maybe kid already test queue allowed school stupid people interpret ""I'm waiting test results"" ""I can't possibly virus"" severe SARS cases recovered lung function within 2 years: case fatigue, knows. common illnesses known cause lasting fatigue, like mononucleosis, usually recover within 1-2 years. still horrible thing go need smart rehabilitation protocol though Eating ass counts mask. full covering nose mouth. Wtf think gonna happen.
There's vaccine yet, think hope Covid nice guy sudden stops infecting? Right, that's many people news agencies begging people stop going bars partying wear mask. 

Just wait nation starts shit us response ""sorry, can't draw army, 2/3 combat eligible people can't even remember they're right now.""

Unpatriotic ass-hats care compromising 'merica!' fucking entire country. 

Don't worry, second largest militaries (and already manned militaries) world countries like China, Russia. I'm sure leaving ethics enforcement world two next 50 years big deal.


Y'all fucked nation fucking PBR fried pickles. Lots worst case comments solutions. vast majority kids follow they‚Äôre asked especially parents help prepare them. know wife teaches school. occasional issue? Sure doesn‚Äôt mean stops class - issue managed within policy. 

You‚Äôre accounting efforts cleaning, reducing class size create distancing. countries children back school they‚Äôre finding ways manage process. 

Your comments actually create questions teachers. can‚Äôt adapt help manage mitigation, really qualified teaching kids prepare ever changing competitive world? report employer safety violation? Potentially, died psychiatric disease due lockdown, true.

I mean, overall lockdown necessary save huge amount life, false think lockdown side effect...  Yep that‚Äôs fine me, suppress sure. I‚Äôm really saying soon vaccine distributed taken (2 weeks incubation time etc) life go back normal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done absolute minimum done too.‚Äù -Southwest Airlines article May. German date format. agree, quickly turn around flights, handful people could sick wiping nose mouth armrest you. Touch surfaces can't avoid, rub eye, next thing know, blam.

Sanitizing surfaces part equation, especially germ box like airplane. mother instance often worked 50-60 hour weeks

Hours poor measurement output.  Used guy team get programming tried compensate working 70 hours/week.   still produced less output team member 40 went home.  actually produced negative work usually someone would spend time trying fix broken code kinda worked sometimes, really standard want software charge people money for.  eventually fired poor performance.  

Now I'm saying mother bad job, I'm saying touting large number hours poor metric.  Work smarter there‚Äôs one many teachers

The ratios management heavy. yeah dumb. calling people nazi share idolatry elon. fanboy. 

here stupid shit elon never wrong. always people wrong. Part online courses inferior person. college took types classes quality education much worse course online. quite. congrats trying.

It's actually called triage. limited medical resources. situation made worse, dangerous, therefore deadlier people CHOOSE ignore medical advice.

Doctors advise wear mask.

If ignore best medical scientific advice, deserve benefit medical care.

Especially get sick even right things. Many innocent people get sick fucktards choose ignore medical advice BTW. (at least Ontario, vast majority people live)

It's plurality, 39% Canadians live Ontario Yes, plan shut down, get virus cases control, track trace new cases. Americans selfish impatient though decided could reopen early. Either need shut get things control, accept functioning society, means kids go school. want things go back normal, can't put blinders situation ways work google suggest new translation? thought would used next time around enough people suggest change, changed all. let escape Alberta want know? JetBlue Alaska also filling planes! JetBlue clean. Covid-19 spread air. would like airlines wipe surfaces flights germs general, example giving covid-19. Also, peewee football practice going great way spread virius, without mask. concerned gathering lack masks. Wow, there's flies you. People dumb mean, sanitation kills anyway? can't kill virus soap disinfectant. Oh real lol Qom two Antibodies seem help patients already serious condition. backs randomized controlled trial Netherlands, ""**Most COVID-19 patients already high neutralizing antibody titers hospital admission.** Screening antibodies prioritizing convalescent plasma risk groups recent symptom onset key identify patients may benefit convalescent plasma."" recent paper randomized controlled trial, used match studies instead, find benefit reducing mortality. I'm skeptical type study, possible captured benefits missed RCT's.

I think say sure without large, well designed randomized controlled study, timing tricky. Given early patients would recovered anyways. Given late hospitalized patients would antibodies. Early identification benefit key, made much progress department. know sucks ethically care patients, want see real change, hospital workers need start talking striking. average age death 79. Average life expectancy US around 76. Let's keep shutting everything down. Totally worth it.

Also another commenter posted, federal protections extend cover paid leave types quarantine, aware of. still PITA go though, I'm sure employers love it. coward like you.

LMAO Risk serious illness virus age group isn‚Äôt high certainly manageable.

Tough shit much older vulnerable teachers, office staff, building maintenance bus drivers huh? school district, union absolutely tried work district plan fall district far refused.

Teachers unreasonable. highly educated want what‚Äôs best children. trying get jobs, want safe. kind thing Alana Morisette would define ironic happened USA?

The current generation leaders known prosperity.

Lack national sacrifice led epidemic selfishness. Decisions seem irrelevant prosperity seems inevitable. people *they* want.

I fear 20s may force us national sacrifice events -- direct consequence selfishness. Parents send kids school apparently sick don‚Äôt want deal them. course parents send kids school waiting test result back. hell kiddo get 1 day testing turnaround?! sneeze made tons various sized particles/droplets. larger ones make 26ft gravity smaller ones float extended periods time. thermal plumes body heat enough waft air force gravity. consider particles generated sneeze, cough, talk breath 6 ft make sense. No. Yep. That‚Äôs probably it‚Äôs getting harder harder think rationally. I‚Äôm lot trouble staying unemotional myself. predicting 5 major storms year. Sure survive next 4 years, trump re-elected comes 4 years anyone‚Äôs guess. imagining end 2020 re-elected trump absolutely horrifying. That‚Äòs toddler, hasn‚Äòt developed object permanence yet, would phrase Ontario, could get back next day. little closer 48 hours.

There tests done field result returned within couple hours. Pretty sure athletes bubbles use. No. Yes. liberal country like Sweden would never see virus spread death rate like ours.*

*Sweden‚Äôs death rate higher ours. would also need test results faster 2 weeks date testing. I'm first person say masks ridiculous. I'm also germaphobe, wash hands day fully believe think there's chance exposed virus quarantine. People following protocol comes exposure quarantine. this? 

Here Vancouver (arguably one progressive city Canada) would say hit miss. typically take two buses morning one bus mask wearing definitely norm, mask wearing definitely norm.There definitely increase far universal. 

R/Calgary also picture yesterday guy driving around sign made painters tape claim masks murder. Read comments postmedia newspaper there. 

There lawyer Toronto filling Charter challenges mask orders. Never mind section 1 Charter states rights Charter subject reasonable limits. 

Plus forget house party Brampton. break Kelowna caused group people Calgary Vancouver person knew infected went bars house parties spread disease.

Even social distancing breaking down. BC we've asked keep social contacts 60 percent normal. 75 percent. observational also? coming angle, randomized double-blind.

I think working, let's get hospitals everywhere! need everything war horrible virus.  Apparently mods thought That's right mentality right there. Idk exact situation America regards supporting allowing kids kept school fuck em, health needs come first. 

The govt financially supporting u ur employment/ financial situation suffer I'm guessing that's happening.....

The decision open schools still baffles though, priorities people power pretty ovbious life health. stay safe okay, family. We've made compromises year, what's more. Right. I'm tough spot I'm rural Virginia really pretty safe. we're still taking lot precautions family NYC Massachusetts know danger here. wife's family respects decisions tell think we're going overboard. stuff almost self defeating. Add misinformation injected uphill battle convince rural people there's problem, experience totally different. Actually really expect United States treat seriously kids back school numbers explode even know don‚Äôt understand attitude. 
 1. ‚ÄòOnly kids adults thirty going die; what?‚Äô implies they‚Äôre acceptable losses, aren‚Äôt can‚Äôt prevented. 
2.	 implies teachers staff schools thirty expend.  3. implies people kids come contact expendable, don‚Äôt matter?

Just...what??!  always baffled Japan, one technologically advanced countries world, still depended fax machines many things well 21st century. Capitalism. Abbott test shown wrong almost half time?

Try asking 1st world country, it. Though fair, anti-science dementia patient running countries would normally agree there, but, grandma without mask. wore one, always do. Average turn around less 48 hours Atlanta proper walk testing provided department health. issue taking pictures beach.. take angle looks like everyone top everyone, really look there's well 6 feet group.

Our Central Coast California town packed. failure government. 

The government power require businesses shut down. power pay everyone monthly income go work pandemic. power put rent mortgages hold. power LOT things.

The fact parents choose ""keep job send kid school"" epic failure part government (federal local) lead. whole argument politically driven. It‚Äôs scientific

Exactly! WH made clear school reopenings politically driven:

""The science stand way this"" - Kayleigh McEnany people already know risk, schools reopen. first people don‚Äôt understand, course shut down, there‚Äôs 0 excuse continue shut down, accept fact many people ok risk coward like you. Wtf? I'm medical school lot shit online second semester first done class. started online learning around end April exams delayed. several students asking full refund like 2 months online. Sometimes gotta deal shit. effective immuneboosters COVID-19 cordiceps, astragalus ginseng? Thank you. Nope, that's entirely false simply means area reached limitation many people tested per day. reality virus waits one spread exponentially. drop inaccurate report severe side effects. 

What mean ‚Äútheir financials absolutely fraudulent‚Äù? think safe plan something school invest in. Like much smaller class sizes ample room distancing well ventilated classrooms. probably double size schools, hire twice many staff, completely revamp climate control systems. really feasible long term sustainable either. Yeah, I'm terrified go back work end month honestly... why? Pandering admin helped approval ratings. What's point this. helping economy. helping approval ratings. killing people pander Trump? r/TotallyTrivial Herd immunity may reached NYC. know hard fragile ego accept may anything wearing masks, Cuomo, anything else. 

Virus burned through, virus burned out. 

  doesnt matter, worst Canada culture, is. I'm going placing anything breath Alberta vaccine. Yay oil, yay mma we‚Äôd done right first time, would‚Äôve lasted months. nooo, people couldn‚Äôt handle staying home one season. it‚Äôs gonna two years bullshit. SOUNDS LIKE WHOLE LOTTA TAKIN FREEDUMBS AWAY However, indications may cross-protective immunity people previously infected SARS classic common cold betacoronaviruses 

Does mean common cold virus could used make humans resistant COVID-19? Would infecting people purpose large scale common cold virus, hopefully triggers common cold like symptoms, way achieve herd immunity COVID-19? so, would great news, right? rip georgia commented post 2 hours old. takes time post move ""new"" ""hot"", majority people see it. biggest sub world, know expecting.

The comfort arrived March 30th. Almost two weeks New York completely shut spread already slowing bending. Social programs paid taxes free money. dont think problem lies made china, lies company produces facemasks.

Isn‚Äôt also incubation period virus? I‚Äôm sure people may react pretty immediately, remember said would likely carry days exhibiting symptoms. 

Seems odd people becoming sick shortly infected. 

Makes wonder kid already contracted virus prior school starting virus mutating infected attending school. Different tests. health department‚Äôs Covid tests take week get back. doc-in-the-box clinic close day turnaround time. Another one close 2-3 day turnaround. using quick turnaround tests available. spread lot people week. would guarantee least half people quarantining get results. People suck.  don't. boy Florida wait 7days multiple countries reopened schools reopen see increase infection Europe (you easily find sources Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, think even Netherlands published something recently). increase infection came schools went holidays people started traveling around going summer parties ignoring distancing rules. get reference probably stop trying act smart right save embarrassment road expect stable schedule rely on. School mandated, expect kids attending daily, except rare times sick year. Again, normal times, grandparents, friends family help pitch in. can't expect people ""pandemic plans"" back pocket. think schools hotels either lmfao!

I hope travel next summer though :( antibody testing? work hospital providing tests. received updated results today.

Percent positive far testing available Got mine 24 hours HI. Where's data showing reached? Here's mine:

I'm rooting Probably please parents want school open. ‚ÄúWe tried‚Äù sounds better ‚Äúno.‚Äù hoping yesterday (fatality count 567 vs 597 last Monday, though big asterisk lot large counties California report) week would start fatality decline. 

Unfortunately today's fatality count 1362 increase last Tuesday's count 1330, time major counties reporting. dramatic increase though maybe still first week decline least first week approaching plateau.

I admit big concern cleaning bong. investing tiktok now? Except attending rallies unprotected global pandemic akin drunk driving. US numbers definitely understated. administration filtering it, trying slow growth testing.

Also, 150k official coronavirus deaths 190k excess deaths baseline. mean could say US whole? Hot Take: COVID proven need end experiment known America. 

How much longer California Alabama coexist? virus done illustrate badly sane Americans need break away madness. Yep, move people walk nurse Starbucks coffee whole flight. Saw pilot deadheading SW well passenger. take sip minute 2 flight. cause us great shame. feel sorry mother. first time I‚Äôve seen idiot equate highly transmissible virus autonomy driving car. Driving cars don‚Äôt leave unassociated neighbor long term lung damage, susceptibility pneumonia generally increased long term risk death/medical conditions. don‚Äôt drive car go hospital survive facing massive medical debt. Doggo save world Well can't say there's line tell us We‚Äôll see long keeps for.

I contemplating moving US, wishing extra money. 

But last two years, desire basically evaporated.

My fellow software buddy there, plan I‚Äôd also had. highly paid 6 figure job, live cheaply, pull ripcord come back Canada savings plan kids (or get sick).

Nowadays slack channel rest us making half-jokes fear life, he‚Äôs reporting what‚Äôs going there, mishandling virus, riots, looting (he saving money living Oakland instead Bay Area proper).

I ignore lot ignorance, even aggressive proud ignorance. would want bail back Canada kids though, don‚Äôt want raise around that. 

But it‚Äôs actually going risk health life, that‚Äôs different question. already spend enough money ensure health well (dental, safer modern sports car, gyms, good food).

Plus company declared remote-first, don‚Äôt really need much money anymore, still quite well Canadian dollars. There‚Äôs real nice houses 2-3 hours interior province.

Then friend‚Äôs US company recently announced he‚Äôs actually also allowed work whatever country wants. Maybe he‚Äôll come home neighbour, house that‚Äôs 33% bigger. 

Or apply US companies go remote-first, remote-first US company poached smartest guy team. Maybe start introduction first. Louisiana here: STEM graduates leave state. 

They've trying 30 years retain them, truth chase one two things: either leave better money, different politics.

A small number stay oilfield, that's fool's game. one wants raise kids know shit education political situation is. think based around religious culture rather location since see issues Mormons Utah. Belief religion negates science people. Gotta wait \~20,000 years that. assumes China published real number - know not... advantage. less lethal less take active measures reduce spread. Yeah mayor New York really shown much intellectual dumb southerners! practice social distancing, whole family wears masks, bring wipes everywhere go.

Just wondering total number cases bit misleading overall threat exposure? aren‚Äôt 5 million active cases. cases gone away due recovery/death. Would mean people deploy best practices become safe time goes on? Remember weeks ago held big, extra special 5:30pm press conference said ‚ÄúOhioans, won‚Äôt get another chance this...that‚Äôs I‚Äôm announcing new restrictions.‚Äù Kansas, group teachers decided go teachers' retreat...11 showed up. Six positive can't start school year...So, yah...Watching trainwrecks unfold. large part America, places cost live they're worth it. way moving somewhere cheaper work COMPLETE introvert. shit, news?

ü§¨ Even number true they‚Äôre hearts lungs fucked life  Burn South. wish nukes around Civil War. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre trying argue Michigan worst *infection rate* number find. literally metric whatsoever Michigan third worst even United States, much less planet mistaking modern editorialists (any show features name host) journalists never stopped factual reporting.

We've gone print visual medium people still learning hosts Tom Brokaw Ed Murrow. That‚Äôs... relevant argument become dominant. Everywhere starting March except Iceland. graphs fascinating, almost italy's cases February. New York's cases. changed sometime January February became dominant March. 

Not new. dont understand anyone- parents especially- think okay send kids back school person.

My friend's spouse metabolic syndrome rapidly turning diabetes due poor diet exercise. complete denial it. careful things objectively smaller chances risk. can't honestly think health problems they've already inflicted, much less face hard work changing prevent further.

It seems risk gets scary enough people respond paradoxically shutting completely down. That's happening COVID. admit risk real much them, pretend overblown hoax. tell affect kids. tell safety measures enough. Anything avoid facing reality face choice sending child danger, endangering entire community, facing loss income quality life inherent keeping kids home full time. us move big cities. still get shafted conservative state government. reasoning people drunk drive regularly think problem everything fine far. Exactly. 32,422 dead half million cases New York, dumb rednecks clearly reason it‚Äôs spreading much! Let Darwinism it‚Äôs thing. sympathy idiots. held us back long enough Was? currently is? Major cities states south mostly mask mandates fines, bars closed down, etc. don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre getting stuff. state big city south bars open, making people wear masks? genuinely asking, links something. read? That‚Äôs part metropolitan area New York City. says right next man. Talk dense. Jesus Technically guy gave us brain use tricking us eating fruit tree knowledge good evil...

But point still stands brain using. imagine brain cancer could transmitted people... would still think it‚Äôs good idea send kids school? Don‚Äôt forget average NFL career 2-3 years median salary around $850k, half make less that. good chunk players could 5% lifetime earnings. Yes. They. Are.

Just people exist conveniently ignore core tenets either, mean exclusive.

Christianity based faith. beginning ask believe FANTASTICAL fucking shit zero evidence. Science exact opposite. Science tome knowledge process process *evidence testing again.*

How two exclusive? absolutely fucking are.

Religion poison. Conservatives cancer. would much better without either. treated religion like treated anti-vaxxers flat-earthers would much better off. treating religious people like media treats conservatives people bitched post. Treating like might point. Like insane. Like come starting point insane beliefs reasonable. aren't. made religion right started preaching rightly think nutcase. someone else preaching 300 years ago sudden I'm crazy I'm religious.

It's coincidence conservatives also fervently religious. two go hand hand. require turn fucking brain go faith, rejecting evidence. groups disproportionately higher likelihoods mask ""skeptics.""

Fuck religion fuck conservatives fuck anyone makes excuses either. Yeah think ever apologized, unsurprisingly. used watch Oprah mom every day always either professional grifters pseudoscience trash exploiting people kind freak accident tragedy. I'm glad really thing anymore. We‚Äôve finally reached misinformation age think it‚Äôs telling rate premature births gone way done (touched upon article, NY Times full article weeks ago). 

You don‚Äôt stay home premature baby, especially premature. go hospital, covid not. births declined. 

This article says behavioral changes like rest probably contributed this. note, women still also facing insecurities everyone else country (loss income, home, etc. ). yet still fewer premature births. 

So actually happened, reason heart attacks (for example) could also declined reason. Despite abnormal higher stress overall, despite uncertainty times, people resting far greater impact health. (In term rest, including things like sleep, relaxed eating, time cook healthier foods, fewer situations like commuting, time work etc. ) ""Despite overall dissatisfaction state country, separate Gallup poll found Republicans, 91%, approve job President Donald Trump office.""

Seriously? ask? family? Rise? Anti-intellectualism pretty well established south long long time. Well shit man.. everyone believe fucking tv tells u... work hospital electrician wear face diaper.. never will.  Yet people wear one car self.. irritating.

Tell more. Like yeast flu bad Covid.

Yeah, this; good thing hold breath. aware people done covid-19? decided month's ago. Covid tell free people live. country live in?? Pshh

/s I'm Christian anymore either. One main reasons left anti-science bullshit spouted. grew loving science able learn understand things way are. Going church always asking never got answers. old enough realized answers bullshit! Ah, Okay. San Antonio here. People vacation locations nothing it? silly WP call Banana Republicans nothing. got 100 people know. Wasn‚Äôt bad flu us. Mainly felt fatigued Wtf on. Southerner here. confirm. people idiots. absolutaly right, kind people kind selfish asses used never take responsability anything, going mental reminded otherwie, point trying insult family victim people like them. reminds people saw unironically defend drunk driving big subreddit asking one asshole, shoes fit way right. weak argument reopening schools. almost 160,000 coronavirus deaths US, 23 age 25. Last flu season 50,000 deaths US, 200 deaths age 25. you‚Äôre gonna argue keeping schools closed, way support, cannot use shallow arguments like this. higher prices, boot!  Maybe it‚Äôs woman charge? Governor Meemaw might best, doesn‚Äôt heels dug far good ole boys charge states. Advice how? Please. looked bit, saw costs 23k, sure would able move still student loan debt. respectful discussion?!

Allowing someone blame others South‚Äôs general refusal what‚Äôs public‚Äôs best interest? 

Eat shit, cunt Sounds like take enough precautions send Mars begin terraforming process.  reality pandemic intensifying, need prepared get hit again. 

It‚Äôs better cleared eyed prepared get complacent. know people don‚Äôt like guy always brings up. religiosity country fucked us god damned much. De Tocqueville even said downfall Republic would American‚Äôs faith. believed much divine providence within notion manifest destiny belief didn‚Äôt matter did, God would make sure everything alright. 

And brought way thinking birth, indoctrinated even speak, teaches youngest age evidence doesn‚Äôt mean anywhere near much faith. surprised people taught faith conquer all, aren‚Äôt listening science reason? 

That‚Äôs say can‚Äôt faith believe science simultaneously. vast majority people capable managing both. aren‚Äôt taught able all. Americans wearing masks. needed things could get store Target went store opened, maybe 30 total it. Mask required. 

I saw 4 people noses mask.

Most masks buy 2 layer, polyester/cotton blend. Last checked needed 3 layers tightly woven cotton.

We pandemic reservoir long vaccine comes out. suppose also think doctorate alchemy worthwhile intellectual endeavor? Liberal north here. take feels wildly myopic unhelpful. So, answer? I‚Äôm pro safety. But, completely ruining every small business, destroying global economy, significant dangers way...you STILL don‚Äôt lose virus. 
There panacea, that‚Äôs reality cares fun? They're adults know pandemic going fun important right now.

 Wow good thier little fun get virus, fuck anyone else gets ""fun"" night. Grow up. always love reading things like this. Cause always shows full shit ""america best country world"" idiots think Florida state gets 100 percent budget commerce. state income tax. 

There option shut state. really look it‚Äôs three county problem. Miamidade palm beach forget one. 

It would outrageous state wide rules state goes Miami (dense, urban) counties farmland. 

The state needs commerce survive. death rate really low people don‚Äôt want locked down. 

Let people make common sense decisions want. 

And way, coming person considered high risk. I‚Äôm pretty confident I‚Äôm fucked get it. 

So 17 year old son went party two people next day didn‚Äôt feel well. locked ass room didn‚Äôt let 18 days except go get tested. (He it). 

I‚Äôm non believer. I‚Äôm seriously afraid getting it. think Florida making best situation can. Thank post.

Meanwhile, ""experts"" Holland -- know, well-known right-wing stronghold - decide masks [worthless even NY hospital head Mitchell Katz minimalist response virus outraged NY health commissioner Oxiris Barbot [just quit department went unheeded (though carefree expertise making NY unprepared virus' onslaught).

Yeah, get it. voted Trump. Unless starred John Waters movie band Athens, they're bad people. They're inbred, toothless, Confederacy-loving....is it? Oh yeah, ""squeal like pig"".

There slight downward trend last 3 4 days, trend increase weeks. week ago worst spike since May 9th. 

Every Monday people get excited less reporting Sundays, giving false impression downward trend. There‚Äôs telling president‚Äôs changes reporting skewing real totals, either - especially swing states. Agreed.

Yes, that's less terrible drugs (including alcohol), playing virus... like fun driving monster truck farmer's market crowded beach. want start saying field work claim opinions viable, I'm putting thoughts see others think. 

For theory make sense start assumption discover indeed reinfected virus based recent studies question.

My theory reason seeing varying levels illness recent studies proven sewage tests dating way back 2019 virus us longer initially thought. knowing people saying well pandemic start sooner? Perhaps happening assuming reinfection possible depending number times infected dictates ill based infection slowly damaging body. Say ppl first infection generally asymptomatic mildly ill, clears confusion ppl get sick don't. reach third even possibly four time infected people ending hospital serious complications due prior damage last boughts fighting off. 

Again expert way claiming facts theory true would fill lot blanks including different countries seeing varying degrees illness death. Places like Italy others Europe perhaps tourists hot spots already population go first second infections ppl third fourth hence seeing hospitalization death.

Thank taking time read this, put thoughts hopes people knowledge viruses could explain theory even possible.

Idk else say this... But:

They fuckin better plan keeping open. necessarily. remember discouraged mask use beginning else would still recommended cloth masks bandanas. telling people risk wearing mask outweigh benefits. People know properly doff them. Touching front mask touching eyes would infect them. beginning campaign citizens wear masks. recognize message sent national PPE shortage. first impressions go long way.

All best, hope get time foe too. Pretty much, comfort thing viable treatments. cohorts grades? ‚ÄúWill‚Äù? Looks like we‚Äôre well already surprise. happens let virus run vulnerable people city first couple months pandemic. NYC coronavirus curve exactly steep curve United States trying avoid.  That‚Äôs happened. previously test, went school waiting results. actually think partial virtual high school great permanent idea too. High school kids old enough stay home alone, way get later get sleep need. still class days, students could choose lessons physically attend based need. virtual history classes enough you, sit 3 hours math need extra help? think students might learn better way. Models show community-wide social distancing widespread adoption facial cloth coverings far better strategies curtailing disease spread 

No one willing this. certain states mandates illegal.

 cases among adults children Texas childcare facilities, seen 894 COVID-19 cases among staff members 441 among children 883 child care facilities across state, potential misinterpreted, Dr. Raszka said. **He studied details outbreak.**

Super credible Doctor Scientist draw conclusion absolutely ZERO information. article trash. It‚Äôs wild it‚Äôs seeming plausible lockdown going work people vehemently literally died due ignorance. dark timeline. like distance learning anyway, gives kids days weeks seeing teachers, meeting class, etc. want kids go school, send them. Figure online learning homeschool. taxes pay public school, need operate. Plain simple. 

Also, quit dramatic ""the slaughter"" kids. That's disgusting. Normal kids die COVID. think great idea, personally. good, anonymous way find someone stood next store 5 days ago covid now. One death tragedy. million statistic. 

This mentality lot people right now. 

Don't like Stalin. Yeah, agree. decision made open (for whatever reasons), would silly shut whole thing anyone symptoms.

Of course, symptoms stay home pending testing, shutting class every runny nose/fever would silly. Dang. isolated group islands hoping could keep virus out. wonder islands world still covid free. Which--as teacher taught high-needs schools large orphan populations--is fucking *wonderful* child's development. Anyone thought schools would safe go lick wall Chucky Chesse. think they'd like happen disregarding consequences actions.    I've scouring people similar issues, sorry late response, i've issue - started symptoms July 3rd fever broke week half super fatigued fairly regular cough. caught working Amazon delivery really want come back. feel terrible, month missing work, hand feel like absolute crap think 10 hour days Arizona heat right :( It‚Äôs simple. think it‚Äôs liburuhl hokes. People selfish, wow. miraculous. live flatlining low levels, odds positive test county family student really really low. also plan limiting spread, shutdown quarantine anyone tests positive. That's happens stop testing ü§¶üèª doesn‚Äôt. shows tested less people due hurricane. Percent positive remains flat means even people don‚Äôt know due reduced testing hurricane. good news! Americans fat. Could coincidence know uses open source code German Irish app base? 

Also: USAmerican, heck done state level federal level? Break wheel 1-50 70s, college education cheap.

This profoundly misrepresents things. College cheap simply fewer administrative staff, mainly 70s colleges received substantially state funding now, thus tuition could much lower. 

Moreover, overhead institutions substantially higher 70s, increased administrative staffing. one, universities huge costs associated technological infrastructure comparatively non-existent 70s. also simply academic programs keep fields developed last 40 years, expanded student interests expectations. Many colleges also simply services 70s - think health mental health services, one. Finally, colleges hub research, research comes tons administrative staff (who, worth, mostly funded external research grants tuition). Altogether, lots reasons increase administrative staff, simply ""bloat"". It‚Äôs sad people even need this. billionaire mega-millionaire wealth share exploded since mid 1900s. Yea, great guys get day test results pack teachers kids schools adequate testing. what? Florida's deaths per day (7 day average) 184 per day, 44 per day 30 days ago, thats increase 4 times. compassionate altruistic american - rarity days!  would mana cost? every kid country infected

Although ones may infect unknown number adults, meaning death count caused opening schools much higher under-18 deaths. People work folks like various reasons. Milo threw fascists, think red hats really care gays? maybe spread aerosol transmission sits cloud six feet high. It‚Äôs fine everyone 20 virus completely asymptomatic can‚Äôt spread  happen people take chance go hospital something kill order avoid bill? Okay, real reason trying prevent hoarding like happened sanitizing supplies paper goods people opportunists can't trusted take advantage crisis. I'm seeing reason refuse wear them. reasonable person able understand that. That‚Äôs called sucking, USA. weird; consider super smart person, average intelligence. really ""get"" technology anything, get decent jobs people tend think might smarter am. Yet seems there's constant feeling like could better job leaders local, state federal levels, regards managing crisis. I've encountered situation talking many times. yesterday first Zoom meeting daughter's new 2nd grade teacher. one, one parents met Zoom (the rest went class). Secondly, teacher said ""We apprehensive in-person meetings started, things different we're comfortable."" turned head sideways confusion like puppy; would people feel comfortable now, there's *more* cases, *more* deaths *more* spread?? f'in disconnect?? kidding. Kids die covid, know? /s upside hardier parents. downside going bunch orphans. here! last week, exceeded expected deaths 4,500, upper bound statistical significance 3,500, 60% death certificates received average within 10 days death.

Edit - 60% deaths counted passed expected deaths 40,245 people. Unreal

This also 18th consecutive week exceeded upper bound statistical significance excess deaths. keep records, puts 2020 11 weeks excess deaths 2017 2018 combined.

Anyone tries gaslight claims ""this normal number deaths"" ""these people dying covid"" ""they would die anyway"" full  helps better safe sorry. Let‚Äôs take second congratulate brilliant teens America. Let‚Äôs get round applause going even go daily case count? Arent extremely lagged entirely accurate? flu deadlier children, yet close school flu season.
 
I imagine overall death rate population, entire order magnitude higher flu. 

Kids carry disease spread it, even die often parents. Sweden closed schools grade 10-12, universities, night clubs, theaters, cinemas, concert venues sporting events, etc, assessment correct. point parents got tested sent school results came back in. scary hell. wife trying decide two houses bought current one. daughter would kindergarten school chosen other. feel way. much pressure re-open parents go back work. right answer many people still looking one. think consistently teaching virtually first part year better results especially classes quarantine kid test teacher tests positive. Preliminary studies show adolescents teens transmit virus much adults. Adolescents teens come contact way students elementary. Thank you, lazyFer, voting AutoModerator.

The two together could substantial part society. nobody refused get vaccinated (group 2 goes away), people gain immunity vaccine (group 1) would much less likely suffer and/or die since infection rate would low. anti intellectual lol still round 10,000 / 100.

Just listen statement politician critical schools take look voting education.

They view schools critical. view parents able work critical, pulled reasons people past told order continue vote yes, spouting it. two week backlogs large parts country. many places FL, positive test rate around 20%, means many, many cases missed. stopped testing, words, failed test people tested. New York though? ton conservative areas New York. Especially upstate. think he'll lose, called election 2016. genuinely think repeat. keeps tripping dick. MENSA meeting, expect. It‚Äôd ordering two shots tequila tall shot glasses lighting fire. drink otherwise known 9/11 really ordered assholes stupid people. Personally, think teachers faced feature, bug. There's already massive teacher shortage U.S., large number older teachers, people could retire wanted to. shove door need.

There's also known problem people graduate bunch student loan debt, can't afford live place low cost living pay low. apply teachers, apply well. 70 year old teacher rural small town retires, 25 year old going come fill slot can't afford make $40k year student loan debt. 

This another chance gut public schools. places unable find teachers hire quality education go drastically. Brazil, India &amp; US autocratic populist science-doubting leaders cater anti-intellectual elements within populations.  Countries shut-down promptly, traced R0, provided prompt tests, wore masks better.  country‚Äôs size doesn‚Äôt matter, belief &amp; policy matters.

Gee, go figure. many sick? many dead? Wish could hear chinese citizens china criticize government. can't make fat person skinny overnight, everyone could put mask tomorrow cut transmission orders magnitude. Why, lose effectiveness?

At certain level discourse, layperson can‚Äôt assess quality veracity given specialized claim. *have* defer experts.

That's pretty much airlines (and grocery stores, restaurants bars, everyplace else) require us. don‚Äôt fuckin say...........? pcr machine actually extremely simple.

I'm sorry anytime Trump says anything delaying election absolutely 100% needs covered media untrue things says needs responded corrected. """"I doubting it.

If people dying Covid, else could ? Zombies attacking ? People like ridiculous. intalectualism.

So words, South people stupid. Protest gud, haircut bad  Thanks dad conservative provinces

Thank you! agree more. Conservatives anti-intellectual though, whitewashed history schools too. that's interesting Spain, Italy, france, Portugal, England, Sweden, full dumbfucks? Workers used gain business productivity increased basically like $5 rest us like claim people making. Or... One day he'll decide disagrees dad still remain family.

This exactly kind sentiment that's problem days. Everyone's fucking holier-than-thou tolerate anyone disagrees anything. May Brainwashed dumbasses thinking smart :) person infected, body's immune system starts generating anti-bodies fight disease.

A lot people skeptics/anti mask died virus without able publicly change tune. Sad shit. There's like 50 people photo, 100 clearly see faces 15-20 people true ... children also die getting car accidents every year, getting flu, heart attacks struck lightening. stats kids get abducted like 40% father, 30% mum, 20% relatives, 8% people know something like 2% strangers. firstly incredibly small percentage children ever get abducted, almost always someone know. amount kids abducted random stranger tiny percentage already small percentage. worried lightening hitting 'around 50 children year abducted killed strangers.

Testing nothing give information. efficacy strategy depends crucially actions carried basis information available: case China, use testing locate outbreaks district level, shut districts case found contact tracing precise (rather batch) testing, treat isolate positive cases fever clinics hospitals (maybe fever clinics large Wuhan outbreak). 

It conceptually complex strategy requires great deal co√∂peration citizenry well rapid co√∂rdinated government response order execute. Probably places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, Vietnam could also try strategy heavy-handed approach necessary since countries much smaller. COVID ripped way rural China could millions deaths resources world get back control. *helps* protect you, completely prevent(from article) save Covid-19. Stop fucking twat.

Are protestors wearing masks? seem accurate all.

Wiping armrests seat belts would huge additional burden basic list, even laxity between-flight cleaning. even try that. got first day school. There's incubation period ya know found school. took test last Tuesday, still results. also work school. private schools straight telling parents not, circumstance, close 24 hours. I‚Äôm speechless. fear shortage, again? income sports. vary lot, could huge. huge income, probably big cost either. needed read today. I'm fly across country Southwest. paranoid enough already. That's biggest one right there. mostly entirely correct. I‚Äôve heard multiple professors Ivy Leagues mention much better teaching schools get cover complex topics class spend less time simple things. compared notes friends mine attended non Ivy+ schools also say classes sometimes simpler. hard zoom want teach kids. What‚Äôs odd Yale extensive online course collection extensive experience running online courses. 
I wonder went wrong :/ Yes, thing happened 1918. People take seriously first 3rd wave locked houses second grader tested attending school? Yeah, ""4 times"" probably still underestimating much time goes online version (I lot video editing additional learning activities assessments). Holy shit guys, thing knew going happen month ago happened. Stop fucking presses. people biggest losers you‚Äôll ever meet There‚Äôs excuse wear now. agree this. I‚Äôm talking vaccine available. even that, whatever I‚Äôm gonna judge wearing mask it. It‚Äôs distancing that‚Äôs problematic. Exactly, it‚Äôs fucking August. winter gonna ridiculous People idea costs went UP. don‚Äôt know half recent library grad, peek mailing lists. 

We needed expand subscriptions journals e-books students. LOT money. needed platforms infrastructure host classes meetings, *fast*. Also take-home technology faculty staff including hardware software.

We also poured money research covid kinds things. Like..one university, us, determined library books needed sit four days. Cool. Cool cool. one that. üò¨ need know curb side. you‚Äôre going scan books students, might need scanners software too. 

There kinds weird, special costs facilities services.

For back-to-school, there‚Äôs PPE 50,000 students faculty, increased cleaning staff supplies, enough free tests everyone twice week 12 on-campus testing facilities. 

Online teaching takes far work teachers in-class. kind bs way class works out, online falls apart faster. Professors administrators working 60-80 hours week deliver instruction. emergency, time really change course‚Äîbecause online course requires completely different model. summer, universities paid train teachers develop online courses. also need teachers smaller class sizes online. 

üò¨ students think college experience education. think facilities educational resources services. Wife ICU nurse, we're flying September, plan N95 masks without removing direct flight minimize terminal exposure (planes probably safer terminals). makes want beat head wall. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, run temps door don‚Äôt let sick people.‚Äù Um...when science EVER show people fever spread virus?!

Ignore nations, best response could possibly do. bathroom breaks water food occasionally every days make sure pass out. That's true, I'd probably keep updating new research, findings, personal insights, etc. Cletus continue watch biased journalism arrogant pricks continue trash different opinion lifestyle. think got one side? People need get mindset zero options here.  Allowing government us continue.  point people need draw line sand say enough.  Nothing going change happens. According people replying one always evil profiteering demon mindless automaton culpability reasoning power.

It's sad see little people think employees enough access fast enough testing keep schools open someone shows symptoms.

We far many school buildings ancient dilapidated HVAC systems.

We medical grade masks mask training available schools.

Some schools even full time nurse staff.

We far many cases right assume spread like wildfire schools, mainly due inaction, disbelief, apathy.

But many people going try vilify teachers schools close. systemic failures leading this, years making. summer work this. mess. person disingenuously expresses concern issue intention undermining derailing genuine discussion. time average American able realize bad guy situations effectively. many painting teachers lazy, cowardly, indifferent toward working parents.

Teachers anything - educate children constant assault job right, resourced, underpaid, we're asking middle pandemic, without precautions taken safety equipment distributed. light fact job could done online good degree effectiveness (even person instruction) risk staff students surrounding community.

Here NYC, we're planning reopening schools transmission rate low moment. Guess - everything shut down. plan kids go back 1-2 days week best - flooding public transportation, increasing community spread homes schools, benefit 20-40% instruction person. That's going solve anything - working parents still need children supervised. Kids getting fraction in-person schooling. hard work done knock virus undone. worst - complication split person online water online learning options.

It's time teachers unions strike put end bad science experiment. reminds something else thats going right now..... Google word ""endowment"". mean think means. can't spend want anyway. know answer, one brought up, responding you. Many exercise without losing weight you‚Äôd look STILL judge them.

Good see people rewarding idiocy. syringe? heard effective viruses inside body. needs fall people keeping masks on

As masks good filtering particles. reduce spread, sure, eliminate it. AC systems blow air around building, may well worry separating kids different classrooms - still get airborne particles. 

That said, turning AC opening windows valid strategy avoiding contamination different rooms building, bad many newer buildings windows open... start August 19th Utah. Wish luck friends. H1N1 pandemic 2009 noted far higher fatality rate amongst kids particular. bad Covid19 overall, less deaths despite way less precautionary measures, amongst kids particular worse believe many schools closed around world. way judging accuracy really sketchy studies. one user debunks studies everytime they're released? 500something username. whole point 1 case 1 death (100% death rate) better 5 million cases 160k deaths (~3% death rate). lower death rate given number cases great that's worded comment.

What. The. Fuck. reasonable place talking viruses. suicides due economic social problems lock downs acceptable?

So TB deaths, skyrocketing due medicine pipelines slowing see graphs provided, California high quite awhile Florida &amp; Texas newly high (and higher deaths per day right California ever per capita absolute). point specifically focused defining ""sky-rocketing"" deaths state chose two drastic recent spikes.

Your source shows cases similar True, spikes happen, think state certain 340 deaths per day thing rest year.

I think statistically likely would agree collection nations e.g. EU, we're not; can't constitutionally (and morally) close state borders limit travel Americans moving states. Americans.

Explain NY quarantine thing travelers. Wearing mask alone doesn‚Äôt work well enough. also socially distant, loved one immune compromised. can‚Äôt see all. spoiled rich it‚Äôs obvious.

They believe they‚Äôve told news media seeing live one reddest states U.S. doesn‚Äôt make easier.

My wife discussed events it‚Äôs means income time being. makes good money allows bartend write.

I hope gives everyone perspective ridiculous thinking among population. wrong anything say, think greatly exaggerated influence ""anti mask"" troops heading. vocal minority situation, opinion.

It's hard quantifiably down, since overlap heavy religious zones impoverished areas basically one one. look worst areas quadrants US, hardest hit, even much less religious states, counties poverty working multiple jobs much common. average education levels much lower.

Honestly, really think need better working class opposed derisive towards them. NYC southern states us. south different NYC NYC different Italy china. can't say ""why learn.""

There‚Äôs reason teen pregnancies higher states. seems like reasonable point me. Correct want know *every* case, largest counties. frame things however want, long *you* one consoling people whose family members died name capitalism.

I never implied TX mandate. Remember either governor senator said seniors willing lay lives grandchildren? *Do you?* finding lots TX seniors signing that?

It's shitstorm, agree. opinion you, personally, TX bad state. opinion TX pride TX fosters made worse.

If rate going down, great. every avoidable death still human interests, friends, family feel loss. Anti-maskers: baddies? Thats good want stay hell away Got it. non southern state: population density. southern state: fucking stupidity

Solid logic read article. soon vaccine available mass distribution masks distancing go economy isn‚Äôt sustainable. really insulated wealth shows, people like shooting guns air celebrate. many places illegal, someone could die. Even aiming anyone, populated enough area there's chance bullet could come hurt kill someone. may even come near anyone. puts people danger.

In Florida could get one year jail, firing gun property, fun. aiming at, trying hurt anyone. could accidently hurt someone 


Because 36,000 Americans killed guns year. 3% accident. 37% murders.


160,000 Americans died Covid-19 4-1/2 months. 32,000 age 65.


It could lower people refuse take simple common sense precautions. put everyone risk. Usually morticians give pretty makeover Yeah I‚Äôm surprised Maryland mentioned. US Naval Academy. Johns Hopkins. Maryland‚Äôs public school system highly ranked country. lot job opportunities connected government. Howard County lowest homeless population country it‚Äôs public library system consistently ranked #1 country. Montgomery County Annapolis/Severna Park/and suburban towns outside Baltimore STACKED. mention, Potomac. Hello!!! Maryland doesn‚Äôt belong list. Maybe Eastern Shore part next Harper‚Äôs Ferry lol People saying good job managed collapse health system pulled back cases state wide. It‚Äôs success story compared states.

There reasons send people hospitals solution criminal. Qu√©bec weird type progressivism hostile people Qu√©bec. experience living abroad progressive world means wanting government social safety net, also welcoming immigrants diversity ways unthinkable back home. It‚Äôs considered hella racist advocate official language, among things. Charte des valeurs also really didn‚Äôt go well one recent history. Ripped stitches mouth laughing this, thanks They‚Äôre single digit numbers we‚Äôve schools shut down. vast majority schools yet reopen.

These variations faulty argument led country taking disease first place. also know many kids preexisting conditions? know least third Americans preexisting conditions well? Go pop twitter comments, want max stupidity. So, first city founded named 1780s, local ferryman John Lynch. 80 years civil war. lynching throughout history never exclusively racial connotation. definition mob execution without trial, unfortunately common practice, especially crime considered heinous. race related lynchings primarily remember today, that‚Äôs reason people grown associate word race last 20ish years. 

The term actually originate Lynchburg VA‚Äôs namesakes cousin Charles. judge took liking hanging british royalists revolutionary war. literally every city south associated confederacy. Atlanta, Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Savannah. somehow much hate towards geographic location 150 years fact maybe need take look mirror. want explanation California. several things play here. Southern California, LA largest number cases due population density. Southern California counties Kern, San Bernadino, Orange counties, anti-intellectualism anti-science going on. due high infection rates among Hispanic population Northern Southern CA.

Here Bay Area, effectively flattened curve 4th July counties like SF San Mateo started opening early. 

For part, Governor Newsom one first governors shelter-in-place. tried slowly open back up, cases started rising again, shut much everyone's dismay. pro life party give fuck kids. know 2020's get even fucked backlog testing 7 days hurricane dip won‚Äôt next week. cases announced today last week.  announce deliberately misinterpreted comments it‚Äôs lot faster. get point fuck want us feel Alabama almost elects pedophile y‚Äôall can‚Äôt seem figure masks work. 

Obviously know south full wonderful intelligent people. I‚Äôve lucky enough know them. However, southern states dragging rest union every god damn way can‚Äôt expect us Yankees cool it. think incivil suggest one take medical advice porn star. pointed career sex work illustrate claims vaccines hold water, attempted tie instance overall larger trend America assign undue authority celebrities. apologize seemed denigrating sex work. America country without empathy. intellectual empathy. America ugly toxic culture ""me first fuck everyone else"". joke kill large number them. believe quat CDC list approved cleaners. Worth ordering. different conversation saying affordability roadblock. absolutely need kind day care solution. need people shuffling class class packed rooms day address need. probably reallocate money opening facilities people spaced much congestion people move space space. Education way behind priority right now. Social distancing also required ‚Äúwearing mask‚Äù. example convention centers cannot work, sports can‚Äôt work, concerts can‚Äôt work, factories can‚Äôt work, etc. means people unemployed. Anyone saying ‚Äúlol wear fucking mask social distance‚Äù privileged white. It‚Äôs literally possible people. Well paid telecoms billions 20 years ago ensure broadband access around country; I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve held end there‚Äôs ample .... no, wait, that‚Äôs right, took money, didn‚Äôt complete work, government done fuck it. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhard‚Äù breathe

Then must wearing wrong ir wearing mask large gaps allowing air fly formally educated read believe random stuff internet?  hope solution. Would wonderful, easy, low tech low cost workaround testing. confirm. One ignorant, small-minded people know prides many countries experiences had. Yet, somehow, lacks sense compassion moral compass. I‚Äôm aware, still it‚Äôs unfortunate picture lol come live Canada? Jesus, boner? Great!

I‚Äôm really curious look populations countries are, combined equal US population, total number deaths existing Florida dangerous. Toilet gator'll get ya! People eating less means fewer high-fat high-sodium meals people. Welcome Georgia live people still tell Trump said February.

1. people die flu.
2. virus hoax make trump loose elections.
3. OSHA says masks bad you.
4. virus hoax created media real.
5. trust God save me.

This said recent last week. One true people died flu still dying. People die parts world make Trump loose election stupid get. OSHA FAQ site due hoax passed around states OSHA recommends wearing masks. Virusbis hoax people dying world. Last least ever read Bible ""God help those, help ""
Parents surprised sending kids school like kind stupid. can‚Äôt true. would think would grab towel beside toilet bathroom going grabbing pillow case. Indian Removal Act signed law 1830. really like 200+ years persecution followed 190 years oppression &amp; neglect, poverty diseases direct consequence centuries egregious mistreatment. cousin spent 100K parents redid backyard reception...divorced four years later. ridiculous. 

Pre-pandemic, always said get married would Elvis Vegas, wearing obnoxious costumes, stream live - $1,500 tops including travel hotel. 

I‚Äôd rather money life comes wedding. 

During pandemic? I‚Äôd happy life together healthy family friends...don‚Äôt need wedding that.  try England method - change conditions definitions 5 phases push ahead regardless. much government hates us. one remember lessons learned Sandy Hook?  Yeah, popular expression means ""Theres nothing you/I it, waste time caring?""

That person moron acting like thats defense. already tried lockdown, work because, lot poor people live daily wages. lockdown place people source income food. Sure government various NGOs try provide them, much due sheer number people. virus really bad lockdown working class, may die virus, many surely die hunger. Also social distancing privilege people big cities India. vaccine even doesn‚Äôt give full immunity protects worst symptoms that‚Äôs point. Like flu shot. anti vaxxers don‚Äôt care get sick die that‚Äôs fault. I‚Äôd wear mask around risk people elderly can‚Äôt shut society everyone else forever. limited availability added risk needed medical care starts add indirect deaths caused pandemic.

This Fauci recently expressed great urgency reducing daily case count significantly fall [flu season].

Then we'll trying figure flu zombies vs covid zombies, dangerous zombies. human condition, one course exempt yourself, right? Haha, irony. think feel? might stricter lockdown measures coming way. I'd least hope country's sake.

Here Australia got record number daily cases deaths today, believe 725 cases 15 deaths memory included 1 person 30s. cant even go work another 6 weeks minimum. curfew, cannot leave house 8pm 5am unless carry permit absolute essential work, literally 4 reasons leave house, absolute essential work, essential supplies medical emergencies only. Masks mandatory they've upped fines caught complying rules. Like serious fines.

The vast majority people complying want sooner rather later. Isaias hit East Coast explain declining numbers states like California Arizona. Seems like following storm closely? 
 
Even then, would really impact one, maybe two days testing East Coast. explain overall downward trend last 7 days. check health dept website see better testing place think cvs one worst every kid infected gets write up, there'll many many unreported. instance source spread. Crammed together classroom, kid long one infected. They'll pass staff, parents, siblings, relatives, etc. One get sick. killing people. Unlike school shooting, fatalities immediately known possibly even obviously connected. case forcing kids class pandemic, responsible surely pulled trigger. Medical workers feel full brunt it. There's theory due interaction/care close vicinity people sick COVID experiencing higher viral load, even PPE place. droplets hang around crate ""cloud droplets"" around patient builds time unless amazing ventilation.


I know medical workers depressed since lost sense taste/smell small comforts eating favourite meal lost them. There's fear ""inadequate"" ""100%"" notice brain fog lead harming patients/coworkers.  4-8 years training rendered useless, hazard. Jonathan! Oh thank god get year's reprieve national embarrassments Unless I'm mistaken someone magical disease-manipulation powers lost them, never control. control humanity environment rapidly unravelling fiction. feds bravely stealing medical supplies dump warehouse let rot. sounds like regular troll me, troll functions handling differently example. 

As Pascal wrote (paraphrasing): ""One counter-example renders entire premise false."" 

Again, go read math book. premise faulty, I'm going keep wasting time trying explain basic statistics. lockdown would cause deaths overall even psychiatric problems. always scored well classes course material front time day, retained much person classes remember anything online classes. 16 hours reasonable turn around, test results shouldn‚Äôt questioned basis. read samples degrade time, samples sit week 10 days, false negatives become likely, test, short turn around time shouldn‚Äôt issue. Oof. depend test type, well. hospital house testing, takes 45 minutes run test, average 2 hour turn around due higher volumes. Every admission gets test, period. Gotta know go Covid unit not. patients admit. Many patients getting admitted surgery get send test, takes couple days. get house testing without potential admission, algorithm decides gets house send testing. Yup. truly looking 2 3 years this, honestly infect now. I‚Äôll roll dice think lot people feel way 3 universities I‚Äôve attended, online classes actually expensive traditional classes. I‚Äôve never attended Yale, though, don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs them. makes wonder class action even work, Yale charge online courses. Nah I‚Äôve read profile you‚Äôre also weirdo. get upvote  United States isn‚Äôt even trying contain it, much go herd immunity sets in? private schools distant learning/ online option? x1000. hospital proper lab able get results quickly. go small provider likely may waiting week send out. states, like Tennessee, illegal teachers strike. Fake_disability69 enters chat strawman alert. Practically?

Safe say literally control. like compromise, let‚Äôs get ball rolling. solved problem. Really though appreciate middle ground wish people would find compromise. would work. Thanks reply making *my donors*' money

FTFY. doubt many politicians directly padding pockets, wealthy benefactors? Definitely. sounds untrue. There's literally point performing test 50% accuracy. Yes you‚Äôre denial. Eventually vaccine drug therapies come out. things go back normal less. Deal it. N95s hard find do, I'm definitely treating single-use thing Never really grocery stores either.... going save kids physical abuse poverty getting families sick potentially causing one parents die directly affecting whether home also affecting able go college? people ever listen yourselves?  choice literally life death.  hard decision anyone bigger problems virus. Lol heart turns die.. going Now? US, sadly control months. ever control. üò¢ wtf? trying continue tweet what? think different types tests - city rapid-test location get swabbed, wait like half hour get results leave. *Muh_Freedom_Karen enters chat* lot tuition also goes toward campus activities facilities paying professors. part reimbursed. course that's hard calculate first place school endowment Yale has. even clear charge students anything. Imagine thinking smart completely missing forest trees. tested yesterday got results today(Ohio) that‚Äôs don‚Äôt expect people wear masks social distance around Endowments often spent certain way, accordance donor‚Äôs wishes. Once, worked small special collection absolutely knew donor wanted gift .5mil collection (which would astronomically ever seen), based personal discussions him, died, manager estate gave math department. Another irritating case special collections might receive extravagant donations allotted ‚Äúbut something cool,‚Äù need *no* money preserve collection need new facilities funding. 
 
Legally, can‚Äôt break contracts. Maybe find ways that, given circumstances, it‚Äôs like university bank account. happening. Unfortunately country full people blinded confirmation bias actually research half shit believe.

**Hospitals** reporting data HHS now, instead CDC. want question veracity *hospitalization* data, ICU data, anything like ... sure, that's probably reasonable.

**Testing** **mortality** data always come directly state health departments. still comes directly state health departments. never came CDC. getting data worldometers.info covidtracking.com Johns Hopkins, pulled directly individual state health department. objective truth takes literally 45 seconds verify sites list data sources. know someone kid class. think ever control. slow tests still take less 24 hours accurate PCR tests. fast sub hour tests usually antibody tests less accurate due cross reactivity etc.

There's technical reason test taking longer 24 hours return results. happens labs capacity. never said places similar urbanization rates levels infection. handle situation differently, see different infection rates. point making actually. Depends internet mean yeah. can‚Äôt manage follow local rules pandemic, don‚Äôt deserve go somewhere else spread COVID/ignorance. got mumps kid vaccinated it. permanent hearing damage it. Sorry hear go too. depends lab appropriate analyzers send test off. run results in-house going quick. wife tests hospital day, two days super busy. provider send test long week. Hazmat suit time? Depends NYC. I've received results 3 days. obvious counterpoint this, know full extent comes children school vast majority time. also fact could long term damage. add risk people work schools, bus drivers, cross guards, etc. know fact die much higher rate. add people children interact outside schools die much higher rate.

So may many child deaths swine flu (not big may), far reaching consequences. debate school opening kids die. seeing long term damage children many adults die this. C'mon, fuck off. 2-3 weeks vaccination I'll ditch all. Can't live 20s social distancing think problem worried first vaccines give full immunity everyone, many still get sick, much less typical, still spread it, could asymptomatic know. Yes child dying awful terrible, suggest trend. going statistical anomalies country 330 million people. Pulling stories saying norm 1,000% fear porn. Get high horse stop trying scare people. There's nothing like zeal recent convert. like we're actually maximizing suffering. People disgusting airplanes

People disgusting *EVERYWHERE* like half country room temperature IQ Ignorance. Blissful ignorance Confederates haven‚Äôt existed 150+ years. guess wouldn‚Äôt expect someone like understand that. Anyway, you‚Äôre terrible job separating perceived enemy exactly accuse Wow. agree...but removed mods? Well without government support, kids go school, parents can't go work, means poverty homelessness some.

Kid going able schoolwork zoom parents can't pay internet bill keep roof heads (and think libraries still closed).

The ability keep school closed directly dependent government choosing support route low middle-class parents. know. care bigotry suits agenda. old leadership dies, replaced ""new leadership"" that's corporate lobbyists executives lining pockets politicians. It‚Äôs infuriating. People like suck. gross reckless. mean, wears high-heel boots basically athletic shorts? nothing. Skepticism science expertise long permeated Bible Belt.

That returning work. want do? Go strike? Actually, many part union indeed so. recourse. BTW, striking teachers get paid. That's works US. See going back work? either that, can't pay rent/mortgage.

So yes, buck indeed stops Secretary Education. making decision endangers public hides behind safety mansion.

This certain govt posts never held career politicians rich folks never suffer blue collar job lifetime. one appointed Secretary Education unless first hand experience teacher public school. What‚Äôs sad it? child mortality rate COVID pretty low. people unironically think this, even staying here? Seems like lot people talking doomed America great countries are, nobody seems talking plan leave country soon borders reopen. obviously trying correct here, since say ‚Äúhypo‚Äù one point, hyperglycemia means high sugar. I‚Äôm T1 diabetic, assume mother is. So, maybe hyperglycemia prevalent people home little top insulin dosages, people maybe eating bit less crazy-high-carb meals? guesses. know sugars stabilized bit period despite stress.

Edit: post refers hyperglycemia, hypo. True. everybody stroking egos ridiculing people embracing ignorance, please keep mind people power often ignorant. positions power authority often keep scrutiny judgement. entire history country beyond, people top passionate motivation keep many people ignorant uneducated possible. want things change, go vote. better yet, protest. mean close testing sites labs hurricane, testing sites labs produce less positive test results? 


I think florida found way stop spread COVID - hurricanes. Stop trying convince idiots. take care loved ones. Avoid stupids much possible god don‚Äôt let harm loved ones yourself, take extra precautions dumb. Meaning we'll keep prices high maximize profits certainly hope good job predicting strain year.

Who would downvote that? don‚Äôt hope good job? Nut sack. want get coronavirus?

Obviously not, fundamentally different risks. fact material differences circumstances means cannot compare risks them, *there literally thing risk assessment.* 

Any inconvenient analogy false equivalence tilt head squint eyes enough. whole scandal that? Look, issues Spanish Flu happened. I‚Äôm saying blaming ‚Äúanti-intellectualism‚Äù south pretty disingenuous. anything blame it‚Äôs high degree personal autonomy contradictory claims CDC outset thing. Masks don‚Äôt help, oh wait, do. Protests fine, concerts festivals aren‚Äôt. Close barbers restaurants. know three small businesses didn‚Äôt survive shutdown, that‚Äôs anecdotal still somewhat relevant.

Contrary reddit belief, cannot completely shut US economy without deaths. Hospitals need operate, food needs delivered, gas needs made, electricity must generated, transit needs operate. million little things happen everyday don‚Äôt live total darkness. virus spread.

Most people knew ok temporary shutdown. Flatten curve, makes sense, there‚Äôs subset Americans think shutdown eradication, patently absurd.

We taking precautions, avoiding socialization, right things, people justify actions regardless much inconvenience someone else. That‚Äôs way world.

Everyone grad parties make proms. Nobody cares anymore. Sweden currently seeing slowdown around 300 cases per day. country 10M 80,000 confirmed cases. country seems reached least level herd immunity actually lower case rate America. 

Another thing consider America much, much bigger Sweden. virus run course population centers like Florida Texas. already ran course New York New Jersey. cases level current hotspots, move new hotspots. end result same. gonna run course lot places there's even chance vaccine. people live areas, what's even point lockdowns social distancing? prolonging inevitable. attitude many people choose flaunt regulations rather comply. Personally, use one week grocery shopping cart. I've read things disgustingly dirty definite germ vectors girlfriend Bay Area never seen Confederate flag publicly displayed life. really blissful little bubble.

Gut instinct serves actually use brain little too.  Looks like devil went Georgia, got beat guy playing better, thought ""Why play fair?"" proceeded beat crap guy. anywhere (without eliminating covid like New Zealand) opened bars WITHOUT issues?

He safer plane please avoid flying possible.

The HVAC systems planes excellent transmitting micro droplets we're dealing with.

The air plane contaminated 2 hours last infected passenger departs.

Also sick mean contract COVID. Testing delayed weeks now.  Delayed testing fairly useless strategies containing disease. experience higher viral load. It‚Äôs reason going supermarket sitting outside lower risk- you‚Äôre exposed virus less time it‚Äôs less concentrated air you‚Äôre breathing. 

Anything indoors/enclosed higher risk. cloth surgical masks help reduce load aren‚Äôt made intense filters. I'd say Thank kids stubborn states putting lives line reasonable states help decide send children back. 

They shall henceforth know ""Canary kids"" indeed thought article going Ron DeSantis getting high bath salts sticking dick crocodile. parents going. gone NC already, might concerned. Lets talk bulletproof vests.

Kevlar vests protect bullets.
Adding ballistic plates vests protects slightly bigger bullets.

Either way, still know got shot, still getting badly bruised even broken ribs. surely better dead.

N95's protect pretty much everything oils vapors. mean stop 100% every virus particle, stop huge vast majority them, hopefully get make sick give enough dose make sick.

Surgical masks cloth masks stop basically big droplets. also stop raw virus particles. Since spread droplets contain craploads virus particles (single droplet often enough make sick), huge help. Raw aerosolized virus particles super common though except certain situations. anyone shared airspace large qty aerosolized virus NEEEEDS N95 better, grocery store fairly safe everyone wears surgical mask cloth mask.

Different cloth masks different materials test better worse, single layer cloth masks tight fitting around nose great. ones better filtering course generally harder breath sadly, thus less popular. think Russian claims regarding COVID-19 vaccines? trustworthy Gamaleya National Research Center Epidemiology Microbiology someone field ? Well, means testing removed, less tests done. That's simple cause effect definitely extremely rare flight....keeping mask touching face. second government tried lock everybody home day country would end. Taking route would result death destruction everybody. think realistic timeline handling this? mean is, potentially getting vaccine finally feeling like sort control banned interstate travel grounded airplanes, disease could best thing since God supposedly flooded earth. could usher new era enlightenment virus washes away sinners morons.

FTFY live AZ know speed test results depends go. people work needed tested waiting 10 days results others waited 2 days Hey friend.

You replied comment poster.

I good one here.... Awesome question schools windows, even open. practically. Actually. doctor messing took several hours swab inside nose. Practically? Now? instant result blood tests live. number tests performed dramatically reduced Florida. something need guess at. say like personalizing education bad thing. accessible people. son graduated Clemson caught bug roommate. Asymptomatic mine RM ""4 day hangover"". 

The early 20's gonna distance period dormitories perfect spreaders. dangerous fifty year old cross paths. effective treatment yet COVID-19? Test reliability low several days later. exposed tested 24 hrs later likely get false negative. Interesting deaths noted ORANGE. 

A coincidence? think not. way control virus without rapid testing, available everyone. lack testing capability like flying airplane dark, storm, without instruments. Let's keep alive educated. saw dumb alive works interview Axios night.  Southwest announced longer thisüôÅ. said added routes, turnaround time anymore flights clean much.

They wipe trays. 

That's flights cleanings (well, clean bathrooms). 

They even disinfect seatbelts flights. trays. clean thoroughly per day (each night?).

It papers. Southwest workers union happy significantly reduced cleaning protocols.

Also, selling middle tickets thing ends Oct 31 Southwest.

Versus Delta, still fully committed intense cleaning &amp; sanitizing protocol every single flight, Delta keeping middle seats open January (but knows? could extended). Hopelessly depressed daily basis. you? trouble filing? Takes day (or two -- depending look it) become infectious 5 - 14 days show visible signs. see happening. 1.5 year old daughter got rapid test. Took 15 minutes results. wearing seat belt endanger others? Maybe passengers car, need help seeing driving without seatbelt alone endangers others. Except Governors would blocked every turn. Actually didn‚Äôt mostly, people used gauze mesh large keep virus - article says - public health authorities recommended ‚Äúgauze‚Äù instead fine-gauge medial gauze effective. , now, imprecise instructions deadly. staying sober
working home
waiting either get vaccine get sick ever able return leave homes without wear masks 6 feet apart? NY mine month ago took 5 days. Recently started pool testing getting pool result 2 days, individual result 5 days pool tests positive. I'm upstate though, think varies specific county. Hyper rare cases show symptoms within 2-3 days there's still incubation period.

I'd keep eye town next 3 weeks. Shits get real. sure. play web contact tracing school environment, quickly realize large gatherings banned. one kid-who probably asymptomatic-could seed results dozens hospitalizations month. 

I'm confident number schools happen long try pie sky hybrid bullcrap. much normalcy, socialization routine. It'll especially hard parents pick shifts part-time job kids house turn around two days later arrange two weeks babysitting.

Countries lower curve full shutdown, mandated masks silenced anti-science dissent halls power. opposite, we'll reap vaccine comes.  want say thank you‚Äôre world right now. 1st sorry loss.

I flown since outbreak, get thinking.
As others said good mask, sanitize hands touch face.
Something would also do. Wear eye protection go even one step further, purchase inexpensive light weight jump suit.
After flight, either place plastic bag possible reuse dispose it.

Edit eat/drink nothing board thought kids couldnt get it, mom?? what? Something smells here, bunch publications coming time. real number fact higher. Many people carry virus without symptoms, especially young people. district getting tested end August school won‚Äôt resume person even hybrid early sept earliest good tests it‚Äôs taking anywhere 2-13 days results also anytime test could contract it.
It‚Äôs nonsense. Truly. I've observed similar cleaning work I've done hotels...

They'll strip linens washed... Towels, sheets, etc. throw tile bathroom.

The bathroom gets cleaned last ""waste"" pair disposable gloves. 

Then they'll rub whole pile around clean way.

So they're using pillowcases specifically this, linens pile. Obama didn‚Äôt even COVID tests Anything possible. wife got back 24 hours. wisconsin think part people think coronavirus hoax many people get tested. It‚Äôs true. Even ten years ago someone said stage IV lung cancer knew death sentence. anymore. I'm general area occurred. plenty people tested wait 5-8 days generally. likely test done past week went school anyways. go talking like r/Canada, sure Albertans stamping feet Eastern Canada probably ban two.

Not wrong. absolutely wrong. Alberta ass-backwards compared literally rest Canada. certainly seems understand subtley.

Well expert, think reason cases ""dropping off"". actually think Corona disappearing? Lol, nothing that's done? future mutations (e.g. spike protein) mean certain vaccines may become ineffective awhile new ones must created? Deployment logistics going main issue especially people trying profit it.   far know one Trump administration even mentioned get vaccine everyone feeling going rely whether Trump wins election not.  Trump loses likely sabotage plan deployment vaccine fuck Biden. I'm surprised one else noticing timeline.

It's trying play fear Covid currently spreading *through* schools, particular case Covid simply brought *into* school. wait bit longer see bringing it, whether he/she started spread his/her classmates. opinion, timeline Oxford Moderna vaccines looking? realistic next spring general population could start receiving vaccines? whole testing SARS-COV-2 national fiasco (overall). Shame. go Ivy League school name resume. go rub shoulders oligarchs, plutocrats, future presidents. friends money power fund business idea, give tax breaks, introduce people get product shelf walmart.

This referred social capital, rich people spend majority time cultivating.

Yes, light measures discipline must-have, even Sweden some. Completely without work vaccine widely available. Weekend...

Hurricane...

I'll see out... ME/CFE. Seriously? That's insane. That's like 10-35% entire population ""There practical way enforce mask mandate"" school?!?! mean years since school, seem remember LOT rules do, can't do, time I'm supposed certain things, etc, school.

I also remember rules enforced, seemed able handle that.

Hell, wrong graphic shirt school used make wear inside out, otherwise send home change. regulate cartoon character student's shirt, can't regulate students wearing mask?

I think balance struck. People gather homes alcohol. really think ""work"" macro sense, broken myriad contributing factors, one biggest contributors range chronic/fatal conditions.

This isn‚Äôt first definitely last virus us. good health needed future virus gone.
My point I‚Äôm bit tired people blaming others virus effects people. According positive rate 18.4% commentary Positive test relatively high percentage (18.4%) COVID tests positive, indicates testing Florida limited cases may go undetected. levels, hard know fast COVID actually spreading, risk surprised second wave disease.

also savage lol fear optimistic. I'm worried they're going keep open regardless many children, parents, teachers, administrators, janitors die.

I think care. see state going ""stupid stupid does"" model raising children properly difficult undersupported society Pretty much highly virulent disease think symptoms. symptom described commonly find diseases flu plague ebola. hangover commonly cause symptoms.

What's unusual disease, lifetime, combination virulence infectiousness. Really extreme mix two 100 years. Another issue, many tests there. example SF Giants get results back minutes, may take couple hours que players, management media accessorials tested day. damn thing exists, can't get acts gear standardize shit? failed Federal leadership, every region themselves, different everywhere say take week. Minutes vs Weeks, sloppy. Blame CDC this. put ""guidelines"" supposed ""help"" contain spread virus anything except that. 

""According updated CDC guidance, required excluded work exhibiting symptoms, want take care monitor health."" 

This job sent finding multiple cases Coronavirus workers. Anyone close contact said workers told self monitor symptoms. 

Even worse, said worker told doctor self isolate 14 days. updated CDC guidelines. told managers could come back work 3 days symptoms went away 10 days passed since then. 7 days self isolation end. even waiting negative result point throwing cation wind. following see child makes healthy recovery not? suspect everything fine, would great follow this. Much gained exposure form herd immunity. important remember exposed mean die, must keep everything perspective.

But beyond virus, children's mental status important too. Pediatricians recognize issue recommended going back school.

So hope point posting concern child merely make political statement. find follow-up child's condition.

like dude mentioned, really \*cant\* wear one, traveling, health already poor condition.

Furthermore, no, illegal. make rules airline, want reason, isnt discriminatory. like make choice wether people wear shoes home not. 


edit: lazy fix spelling lol Check post history too, dude right wing nut job. Seems anyone ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù pandemic without facts youre gonna wear gaiter, would pad inside generally pretty thin thought process is: trump says schools must open Georgia governor boot licker. wear mask wrapped around head, literally. take serious ever will. FOOL. Get internet let adults discuss. win mean one ever gets sick dies sure can't win never ever. single year, single day since began.

On hand, proper understanding life death stop letting social media people something gain making everyone scared chance. Come on, lot space ""never safe"" what's happening country right now. 

We know gung ho reopening restaurants something, dont pretend like two options. first Japanese girl tested negative second PCR test, tested negative antibodies. 100+ contacts Taiwan also tested negative antibodies current infection. also symptoms. positive test result likely false positive. 

The Belgian guy IgG antibodies (long-term). 441 contacts tested negative PCR antibodies. PCR test picked dead virus residues. catch infection Taiwan, pass anybody. also turns loss sense smell taste MARCH (while Belgium) Thai worker's 189 contacts Taiwan tested negative PCR antibodies.

So virus going around Taiwan, easy find. think problem ultimately schools businesses administrations paying buildings. saying opening good idea see groups want pay spaces unused. It‚Äôs dumb thing think lot administrators. get point you‚Äôre making even agree you. However, point, SOMEONE going end holding bag. student(s) aiming them, that‚Äôs completely understandable well. exactly Ive saying, teachers students start dying American people whole able deal faces plastered news. Sure anti mask assholes probably give fuck, small minority, us still give shit others. went home Friday cough, took following Friday get results. 

The test results three days, first nurse quick order test, local nurse schedule Tuesday following. time actually took plus 3 days results, week. Wearing mask mentally scares you? sound like weakling. agree that. 

After googling around shortly found 2016, 2.3 million people incarcerated United States, rate 698 people per 100,000. Total US incarceration peaked 2008. 2008 US around 24.7% world's 9.8 million prisoners. 

24.7% world's prisoners seems bit... 2016, total number persons U.S. adult correctional systems (prison, jail, probation, parole) approximately¬†6.6 million. 

What?? total population entire country 5.8¬†million. end 2016, approximately 1 38 persons United States correctional supervision.

*Sigh* ...perhaps get better welfare systems something. Everyone going get virus. matter time. lock down, stay home, avoid people completely, destroy economy still eventually get virus. Everyone world getting next couple years. thing get healthy boost immune system. kid nearly lost life 7 years old pneumonia.

I did, didnt I? shutting everything looks 1-2 years time wrong. 

Why? died pneumonia 7, one would bat eye call shutdown schools they're unsafe due pneumonia/flu.

Yes, generally speaking Pandemics threaten kill 1 million people globally treated seriously single dead 7 year old. It‚Äôs also important note many forms pneumonia aren‚Äôt contagious, people actually get aspirating food (like grandparents) bit different contagious pandemic well, pneumonia created equal. almost died child burned hot coffee don‚Äôt think need lockdown country Starbucks, existence Starbucks prove Covid shouldn‚Äôt taken seriously. 
They‚Äôre different things. going apply standard disease 0.4% death rate, better others area.

We‚Äôve 4.85 million confirmed cases US according today‚Äôs numbers 159,000 deaths. 
That means 3.3% confirmed cases lead death, 0.4%. 

Regardless, using death rate isolated statistic minimize impact pandemic intellectually dishonest everyone knows this. people contracted Covid death rate low would one thing, *millions people* catching Covid it‚Äôs much contagious Flu Pneumonia. argument akin saying ‚ÄúWell death rate deep sea diving worse driving cars!‚Äù ignoring fact lot people drive cars go deep sea diving. Using numbers context tell part story fits narrative hypocritical bullshit buddy. Don‚Äôt guy. Everyone going get virus. matter time. lock down, stay home, avoid people completely, destroy economy still eventually get virus. Everyone world getting next couple years. thing get healthy boost immune system. wish easy. people inflexible death without wanting change.

-Frustrated therapist works south. Yup. Get 1% it‚Äôs good. breaking news, water wet. I'm Sweden got lack teachers, educated people getting teachers. 1 teacher gets sick, we'll teacher class long time. insanity. Took 8 months school get new teacher missed whole class read year after. Wonder Corona. think Americans don‚Äôt care happens kids inside schools‚Äîjust look US hems haws comes protecting kids domestic terrorist school shooters anywhere state Im saying fucking corona virus fake. God talking leftists fucking hard. Youre purposely obtuse constantly fucking dumb.  people say ""they counting car accident deaths""

In mind really believe like 200k car accidents year others, telling want hear?

It really hard discern folks sometimes I‚Äôm research Emory University right get tested whenever want results 30 minutes. get results allowed drive off. Deaths going rise levels seen months ago. 

The rise cases real, there's transmission, testing capacity also much higher was, around 50-60% new cases asymptomatic, detected contact tracing mass testing done regular basis hospitals high risk environments. Durng peak estimated 10% infections detected, percentage much higher now.

There also better treatments available back March-April also better protocols protect care homes (spread care homes deaths caused really tragic back then) old people always calling ""media"" (aka local newspaper) complaints? going good.

I'm commenting article media people spoke things called ""jobs."" way pay things called ""bills."" afford stay home children semester with.

I guess struggled read sentence right one replied to. realize necessary people common cold/flu, right? can't mentally scar 365/366 days. stopped getting them. much difference couple years shots. effective pain lidocaine steroid cocktail, temporary. got medical residency, feet lot. sit work, feel like handle pain. system place pay people stay home, DESIGN. simply get people back work. 

Welcome..... machine! Everyone going get virus. matter time. lock down, stay home, avoid people completely, destroy economy still eventually get virus. Everyone world getting next couple years. thing get healthy boost immune system. know, that‚Äôs kind like discussion work small nature center...someone admin said department (education) doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù offer daily ‚Äúhomeschool‚Äù 50 kids time, even paying us for? said afraid getting sick jobs, maybe need think that. reaction ask take inevitably get it.

To add: see it‚Äôs hard make decision beforehand, wanna bad thing happen point say ‚ÄúSee? told you!‚Äù National disaster possibly numbering millions set right now.

This going get ugly deadly. parents summer camp, decided open. 
We test everyone almost 3 times follow extremely strict codes conduct, restricting could come quarantine summer. still scares despite following every protocol imaginable. It‚Äôs really taught lot hard contain disease.

What schools aren‚Äôt even close massive scale people, don‚Äôt see anything open yet. We‚Äôre making worse places sell faster tests. saw YouTuber say needed get results quickly paid test same-day results. I‚Äôm keeping safe I‚Äôm 100% fucks give. Everyone else go hell. can‚Äôt fix them, save them, keep safe. person look me. don‚Äôt even like lol Trump quite good communicating stupid people. problem communicates bad things.  remote instruction first semester. That‚Äôs concern personally. point majority teacher force would find jobs far quicker sectors schools would replace competent staff. don‚Äôt it‚Äôs super rare get teenagers I‚Äôm trolling faggo, earned rainbow medal(lol). Congrats private.

You seem want schools opened? know somehow issue politicized ‚Äúconservative‚Äù idea? flew Southwest. care claimed chemical kills virus, still took every single precaution.

1. arrived airport later usual. Whereas I'd usually get 2 hours beforehand, arrived 1-1.5 hours boarding limit time airport
2. wore mask, well face shield. face shield warm, got used little plane.
3. paid extra Earlybird one first plane choose seat felt comfortable in. get earlybird, paid upgrade boarding.
4. Upon getting plane, wiped seat, arm rests, window area, buttons top, tray table, etc.
5. sanitized hands.
6. I'd sanitize hands often, time touch mask face (itch go away, moving mask quickly take sip water NEEDED, wiping mouth (dry lips big thing wearing while)
7. plane started land, wiped electronics out, stowed rihgt away landing
8. Upon getting home/to airbnb, wiped luggage, sneakers, stripped clothes, put luggage outside sun possible, grabbed shower.

Edit: also turned food drink. brought bottle water plane. coming dry location (Denver) took one sip water plane pure necessity. 

I'll report back 2 weeks caught anything. suggesting going another country *only* spending time inside resort high profile tourist attractions doesn‚Äôt allow people engage local culture? TX AZ brought refrigerated trucks, yes morgues overflowing. Texas? article didn‚Äôt open iPad reason. middle class still live parents? real someone agree view points make stupid.

It disagreeing stupid.  I'm surprised covered much here. People also seem forget Bolansaro made statement implied Brazilians form immunity well due race. 

‚ÄúThe Brazilian needs studied. doesn‚Äôt catch anything. see guy jumping sewage, diving in, right? Nothing happens him. think lot people already infected Brazil, weeks months ago, already antibodies help proliferate,‚Äù Bolsonaro said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful that‚Äôs really reality.‚Äù - March getting bottom stop pandemic, much dishonesty right advance political angendas disgusting. ""racist health care"" narrative racist. everyone imagining white doctor giving poor care black patient? many Asian Indian middle eastern doctors treating covid patients? well? Ask that. personally find attacking health care workers risking lives pandemic racist horrible.(not you, general mean) WaPo doesn‚Äôt realize isn‚Äôt regional, it‚Äôs political. Eastern Washington state looks different south. keeping cancer patients away hospitals COVID present crucial. see blast Beirut? Hmmm, another way say ‚Äúhow tell stupid people save themselves‚Äù. may death curve start falling fast Trump seem worried.

Trump could claim victory went backdoor Sweden. spread covid-19 ~~in South~~ shows risks anti-intellectualism

I‚Äôm NYC metro ‚Äòtri-state‚Äô area live metro ATL. also trying run marathons 50 states (pre-COVID) find pretty random pockets country.

Even Fauci hope it. many situations hand washing isn‚Äôt available though, serves large purpose compared disinfectant wipes better spray bottle paper towels. r/unexpectedstartrek could big heat, humidity put something water too!   Unbelievable. cruises leave? I'm going say since thinking it. make masks permanent requirement society? mean, even pandemic ""over"" (let's face it, it'll NEVER over). It'll make us much healthier going forward. pass form law something? good job Asia keeping things control. Can't doing? SeaDream Yacht Club late Tuesday said passengers crew one two ships, 112-passenger SeaDream I, placed quarantine board vessel passenger previous voyage tested positive COVID-19. Quit believing every doom headline see. Think projections back March predicted 2.2M dead. based .9% fatality rate 81% threshold herd immunity. look places like Stockholm, London, Milan, New York City actually got hit extremely hard. New York City saw 23,000 deaths (including probable) city 8.3M. one highest death rates world, still way lower original predictions. Sweden seen massive decline deaths recently *no* lockdowns mandates. extrapolate 6000 deaths country 10M, that's less 200,000 deaths country 330M.

Treatment gotten better, many population centers already hit extremely hard basically zero risk second wave, latch onto every prediction doom gloom see internet. bad mental health. max deaths, we'll quite lucky considering many cases lot southern states (and still are) producing. initial criticism completely wrong statement ‚Äúthe south plan‚Äù regarding schools reopening. think agree that, even though plans may flawed, statement unequivocally incorrect.

You continue moving goalposts initial comment want. plans going better others. know county went school in, well county currently live in, requiring masks students. 

I personally wouldn‚Äôt let child anywhere near school make decision, luckily seems though almost every county tell giving parents option virtual classes. Ranch land technically. use analogy ‚Äúsociety still functions normally despite risk car accidents, highly transmissible virus too‚Äù. can‚Äôt see possible perspective stupid unequivocal current situation, can‚Äôt help you. I'd say logic pretty easy one.

If follow simple rules prevent disease establishment, would trust follow others like washing dishes properly discarding food that's date, cleaning prep surfaces prevent cross contamination? passed someone publix saying ""I'm gona wear mask look like terrorist"" almost confronted him, then, wearing mask... live Georgia. Sorry live Georgia  doubt anyone vaccinating end actual pandemic first go around going concerns People still getting cruise ships? Yes. labeled deviant person two choices. Either reject label conform accept label become bigger deviant. faith.
Good luck trying come excuses.
Hopefully, won't.  I'll take no. Insinuation quite weasel word. mentioned north dipshits kept acting like protests caused governors‚Äô faults. I‚Äôve lived south relatives there.

There's also little reason remote workers paid less company competent management. employee bring company less value they're working home. Facebook planning transitioning 50% workforce remote work next decade. think software engineers managers settling lifetime lower salaries.  that‚Äôs Trump meant Florida cases going Covid already killed less year.

HAHAHAHAHAHA ah MeriCa... paying FULL price tuition cutting like 50-70% staff... Leaving teachers teach online admins reaps rest money. Hell Colleges might even start selling parts campuses.

The reason online colleges cheap cuz none overhead. Yet want everything. salary quadruple. ""Then pension/retirement greatly increase due years"" 

Oh MeriCa. 

Ya know people record online classes spread online.

BRILLIANT fact feed dorm instead stay home taking money borrowing cost parents go + tuition. 

Then worthless degree... Owe several hundred grand debt. even job due pandemic. Online degree say worth nothing say. Oh.

Let's also forget even really *are* side curve states, that's still several weeks we'll wait safely open anything up--and states start fuck time, going naught unless state borders start closed. thing they've past 3+ years, they're talentless hacks pander certain people. even feel I'm childless. hardly take care days whenever watch buddies kid like I'm functioning adult.

Keeping house clean much safer easier jobs. see anything 24/7 get exhausting shit. worse things. wait Thanksgiving Christmas, finally get see extended family long.... poorly researched written news story. doesn‚Äôt state child tested. doesn‚Äôt say whether students tested tests even required attend school.  There‚Äôs implication child infected attending first day school.  There‚Äôs also implication kind fast turnaround test results, seems impossible (in USA, outside White House). think would enjoy Sol Weintraub‚Äôs story *Hyperion*. second-grade student Georgia tested positive coronavirus attending first day school, leading district ask 20 students teacher self-quarantine two weeks. even vaccine first SARS virus yet; seeing anything SARS-COV-2 time soon. That's extremely unlikely happen via way school board vote, guess members school board town Mississippi shit probably like? live Georgia time I‚Äôve tested, usually get results end day. called ‚Äúrapid testing‚Äù, also surprised returned results quickly. could area though. think still places take longer return results depending go mankind deserve get man's best friend? ended hospital ward full people age 20-30.

Nice work company decent cash reserve. one point, 11% I'm sure numbers making news now. I'd say testing going people choosing tested way were. mean, UT. lot people pissed mask mandates, religious rights, social distancing, blah, blah, blah. Costco first mandated masks here, would thought asking people give first born. lot deniers Plandemic believers, Trumpsters, etc. governor literally say press conference Bill Gates behind pandemic following science versus fear. bizarre, oh Utah. know multiple people tested positive, received results within day two. Negative tests generally slower come prioritize positives. I‚Äôm scared going ruin life. sticks around don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll able things want do, like become teacher, get married, children own. It‚Äôs kind terrifying right now.  low death rate spreads rapidly. still equates high number deaths (we 160,000 5 months) virus quickly spread kill. 

A virus high death rate spreads less effectively would probably killed less people.

Your take extremely selfish. Name single motive anyone would shutting worlds economy. TA worked super hard bring quality online education students little notice, panicked professors, minimum wage pay, hurts. understand. \*goes cry corner\* true. can't imagine voted.

It's entirely possible learns virus change mind. transparent learning new things updating advice. know that. there's sense pointing people going throw hands argue everything made propaganda, that's CDC website, FOX says... Speech therapists available outside school setting. wraps water! means likely exposed school started. generally takes longer overnight symptoms, let alone positive test result. Since keep ignoring every point I'm making, already pointed significance taste smell loss major difference degree suffices strong predictor Covid vs others. 

""Again what's unusual Covid sheer increases virulence frequency symptoms, existence. much likely die difficulty breathing Covid, degree loss taste/smell occurs extraordinarily high degree cases generally stronger effect, making strong predictor, symptom wise.""

It still exists - suggestion flu causes sinusitis there's serious complications quite extraordinary. Sinusitis inflammation caused infection, symptoms also ones infection.

All nuance useful people ignoring everything actually said, course.

You still spectacularly silent spectacular claim difficulty breathing. desperately worrying findings indicating even never symptoms lasting organ damage ‚Äî permanent serious, don‚Äôt yet know üò∑ district said plan close 48hrs disinfect student teacher tests positive.

People act like kind talk overreaction, we're fully emphasizing much fucked up. Well source posted comment. Also, literally second paragraph CNN article says ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre immune.‚Äù Immunity COVID seems like might complicated. can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre herd immunity shown. It‚Äôs even known immunity lasts long enough true herd immunity really possible.  swine flu around George bush Jr taking seriously national threat. there's still leadership denial far greater contagious virus. legal take away retirement they've earned? WTF. hotspots like Texas Arizona closing testing sites extremely early due excessive heat (100+ Texas 110+ Arizona).

The first time way early pandemic begun breathing problems along chest pain forced go doctor. given test got results believe within week. (I it, sinus infection later found lung problem minor) blood test. 

The second time, unfortunately, remember much due seizure time. dealing medication heavily messed blah blah blah, went unresponsive seizure vomiting myself/aspirating. reason also tested virus. pretty sure also blood test got back right away show negative. 

The third time recently, last month. scheduled surgery (I get ovaries removed new rules stated take test surgery) day two test nasal swab test done. (For record, bad people make be. teared eye felt uncomfortable pain.) got results within 48 hours tested negative again. 

My sister received test believe little week ago also surgery (she get neurofibromas removed) also received nasal test. got results within 24 hours. 

Some clinics send samples labs that's takes long some. hospitals/clinics labs. That's told nurse surgery. downvoted person telling truth? Biden says veto M4A legislation even crosses desk fucked enough blamed failure. failure others mitigate doesnt absolve cancer society. hell need for? dumb cult members tell Facebook Twitter truth. *it even make landfall* results took 3 business days, 5 overall including weekend. within last 3 weeks People keep trying engage COVID magical thinking. ""It'll go away"" big one, ""Once numbers start go down, safe again."" Hell, even see comes testing. many people act like negative COVID test free pass forever, really means one particular point time. guy converts lawsuits people living rock understand online classes always worked. Almost always pay tuition receive credits.

If cut price argument course inferior cut credits well. great outcome? pay amount either take twice long finish degree forced take twice many classes. work Georgia different school district. way contact tracing works ‚ÄúWho within 6 feet infected person 15 minutes?‚Äù Everyone else safe! üôÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è agree with.

I actually lasting effect well. lying developed acid reflux (silent reflux, accurately), means esophagus muscles pretty worn long time careful eating much acid food, wait hours eating sleeping, things never worry before. better now, I'm still mindful it! Cases going already hit peak places let run course. Lockdown measures hurting people virus could Virus like 2% transmission rate via contaminated surfaces, droplets airborne. Wearing n95/p100 plane would cover 98% way without going overboard (you'd need goggles/two sets gloves next 2%). American populace literally won‚Äôt stand that. real problem us layman understanding differences two different types tests.

I mean - yeah - clearly / understand difference molecular testing antigen testing. might well complaining $100 steak fancy steakhouse come fast Big Mac.

As ""national testing apparatus,"" schtick - also largely stance taking ignorance. Throwing existing, fragmented, workable system labs United States has, federal government run testing system, would absolute fucking nightmare nearly testing capacity currently have.

I'm saying nobody things better - nobody fucking said - saying idea stupid. Wont listen put masks theyll listen send kids petri dish land. Blows mind.

""You're making put cloth face muh rights!""

""Okay little Jimmy probably going get sick might friends die. okay everyone dies. Maybe even months. I'd love keep home governor says gotta learn ok bye bye sweetie remember look ways cross street!"" one denying kids education. Kids still learn online. ideal? no, course not, still learn provided kid puts little bit effort it. Shut fuck bullshit strawman.

Furthermore, denying teachers, staff, parents, rest community right health life sending kids back.

Let's simple thought experiment. Suppose owned plot land uphill small stream fed town's drinking well. used land, right, raise pigs well dump poisonous substances. every time rained pig shit, human shit outhouse located land, cobalt, arsenic whatnot washed stream village used drink.

Now people end fine drinking water get sick due bacteria poison coming property, others die. know pig shit chemicals washing stream, know shit chemicals making people sick others die. given choice whether want keep using land chemical dump/pig farm? people town given choice whether wish drink water? want drink water wish drink water go without water. Disagree 5 day statistic relevant, weekend occurred midday peak last week counted. seven day statistic still increasing Thank you. able eliminate good.

If develop symptoms afterward, wait 3 days post symptom onset best test accuracy, want get tested anyways, day 8 post exposure probably best bet, aware false negative rates high pre-symptomatic tests. Timeline:  Yeah people acting like ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt catch school‚Äù meaningful statement.

He brought virus school building likely made contact many previously never exposed. virus spread exponentially, means single anecdotal story might big impact community school in. Yup, point we'll lockdown winter. tested got results day. seems private labs faster department health ones. Darwin never loses. Thank you. Interesting responses below. think many outside NY assumed already case, reason, stayed away. real thing, opposed imagined, what's needed. (too many vacationers sneaking in)  tally yet swedes still coping covid complications? I'd imagine high considering semi shutdown.  school made first semester completely online second semester they‚Äôll give choice whether go school continue learning online give ""stabilizing treatment"" like CPR naloxone, instance. beyond follow-up care like imaging studies discharge, example, could denied.

And hook figure pay stabilizing treatment. percentage New Yorkers estimation contracted virus? There‚Äôs really point visiting NYC pandemic over. You‚Äôre right that. Absolutely. Robotics Sportster 

Now That‚Äôs name heard long time... That's mildly disturbing live here.

Our governor finally issued statewide mask mandate (as opposed 13 27 counties), honestly.. little, late people follow anyway.

Yesterday, held press conference suspend reopening 7-12 grade schools, select counties high caseloads, opposed entire state. Meanwhile, K - 6 starts various forms reopening Thursday.

I foresee numbers rising within next two weeks exponential amount, sadly.

2020: year solidified hermit residence status. Darwin‚Äôs kid's high school used laptop touch surface stylus, 2017. math OneNote. trouble republicans bitched unemployment benefits stimulus encouraged people work.

But rephrase that.... encouraged people *stay home*.

Which fuck first place.

Their whole goal get everyone back work even work essential exactly *shouldn't* doing. Oh absolutely. hard keep class engaged person, remote even worse. super hard feel involved looking screens. get it. takes lot personal side things. teaching material, I'm worried students burning remote learning losing interest. chandler (Suburb Phoenix) go go grocery stores it‚Äôs like 95% now. comparison stores back Memorial Day weekend like 15% max. People made fun Gerald ford literally moron. president belongs short bus supposed take seriously? üôÑ Yes, based conversation parents children another 2nd grade class Sixes, exactly happened. knowingly send sick child school. Yup you‚Äôre missing something.

Iceland did. go hot spots people cleared clump together. Limited contact contact tracing pieces here. Eventually people clear hotspots limited. Hint: US even close part yet. got mine two days Walgreens.  keep hearing thing ""people underlying conditions exempt"" people share household people? get kid's getting it, period. amount care needs would impossible take care him. seems They're jist like ""well, weak die off, guess"". appropriate response knowledge technology today. state go ER L&amp;D emergent problem you‚Äôll rapid tested. perhaps, kid came home school shortness breath, goes ER, finds he‚Äôs positive within 2 hours later day. would caught virus prior day school, potentially spread throughout day there. guy dumbest person set foot inside White House, far.  Trump save holy magical healing powers! mean. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going naturally happen plan/endgame/or exit strategy. Covid19 much higher death rate made people spew blood something then, yeah, since doesn‚Äôt people kind return normal. need strong messaging leadership don‚Äôt that. quoted part article said White House going use Act get tests made. understand continuing say can't done.

They looking swabs sample collection equipment, longer limiting supply. agree easier come act generally used get manufacturers, make things, make something specific. factories make products would repurposed.

Other factories would need paid fortune (the orders still require get paid) amount construction certification required, say nothing knowledgeable staff, etc, would extreme. take long time. Probably north year.

You'll note backed using DPA. Probably manufacturers explained, ""this something know it'll cost fortune also slow happen"". Lol! hate accurate is. pointed student likely get school. high probability infected someone school though. (I know that's better).

It go show even without negligent intentionally ""going school sick""; Covid school. negligence malice needed. He‚Äôs said number times, correct - passage time, we, and/or virus go away. Like... absolutely everything else exist. Glad he‚Äôs vague :/ Republicans, mean Republicans criminals, supporting regime literally enemy humanity. Vote entire party nonexistence. worst Democrat still complicit criminality trump regime. Republicans must voted utterly prevented establishing policy; 3 half years taken resected country damaged ways foreign enemy could hope do. economy shattered, pandemic government ignored grotesque debt run make already rich richer, word international affairs worthless, laws meaningless power, police given free reign brutalize citizens. called leaders openly pursue racist theocratic goals, reject proven science conflicts profit bible. Always vote, never Republicans. Hold nose need be, must stopped. one 1933 envisioned 1940, benefit history. History, Republicans attempt rewrite alternate facts, bunker inspections, Bowling Green Massacre federal troops turned citizens. test Ohio, results came back 10 days later Good luck yours. hope learn hard way might best idea. forget read article speaking on, COVID may lasting effects children brains. Next time see kids acting 'strange' dazed fog problems home work, think back conversation. *may* covid know. Best luck!! don't, lot people use religion feel superior make feels bad they're ""godly"". sickening. May suggest r/fundiesnark braindead. think kids live school? People thinking ahead absolute buffoon. Kids live parents grandparents; yeah I'm sure everything fine. Yeah that's point. parents could seen symptoms prior blew pumped meds, get school.
It's common practice parents work whatever. school gets kid phone goes mute. gloves colossal waste time. realistically carry box gloves carry bag purse chance cross contaminate extremely likely. 

example, gloves present passport boarding pass tsa agent. tsa agent gloves likely wearing means basically contaminating hundreds different people onto passport pass. grab glove place purse/bag. toss gloves. shit already purse rubbing everything else. Many didn‚Äôt get positions willing take responsibility uncomfortable stuff agreed, commute burn real. wondering thing. went school? lets say today exposed virus would test positive tomorrow? problems bigger that, parents good enough education enough subjects. i.e. passed subjects 10 years ago used updated knowledge since. said sounds like doctor brushed regular viral infection like caught cold. firmly camp better safe sorry, article actually leaves questions opens door perception fear mongering. article lists large group people gotten virus interacting groups, relay severity cases. may couple hundred people, one hospitalized, died experienced severe symptoms, makes look like flu.

I want truth told, stories like make seem contagious severe. parents powerless.

They power send kids school.

Whether strength wisdom completely different question. think lean strength wisdom, causes make mistakes. wife teach brother, sister mom work hospitals. It‚Äôs terrible idea schools back session. live within 2 miles school. believe, based neighborhood FB posts (for that's worth) child fever Monday tested positive Monday night early Tuesday morning. first sign symptom child had. apparently send child school pending test.

University Phoenix may technically better Yale since nailed online learning processes years ago.

But think underlying issue whether university saw decline actual costs pass along discount. costs go went online learning equipment service costs I'm sure there's legal reason award damages. 

Perception value entirely subjective something really sue over.

Sounds like something parents children worried about. cost burden taking responsibility entirely unrealistic, flat irresponsible. education system radically crowed underfunded is. room ESL programs require much lower teacher student densities, take away available budget remained school system, little real benefit. developed countries Europe programs schools help children speak language. 

Source? British lived many EU nations; NONE non-native speaking programs public schools. programs parents expense, private tutors, private teachers teach local language, private English speaking schools, free program burdened public expense children. well basic right children. 

No isn't. Immigration never basic right. child basic right catered expensive public school access different langue. Public schools available them, everyone else, public's responsibility fund anything beyond public school access. unable use public schools, matter due disability, inability learn English/German/Spanish/Italian. probably important Facebook posts need read refute claims. Cmon, research, cite sources lol rapid test. Results within hours. worked restaurant 10 years that, completely avoiding restaurants since pandemic started. parents working home cannot work children house also expecting somehow assist online learning. happen thankfully live place case count low enough kids are, now, attending daycare. Also since 5, chances transmitting (according recent research) statistically lower slightly older children. Also type job pick choose work throughout day, vs available. 

But company employs people must available certain hours day answer phones clients call questions. people do? types jobs - available talk clients call- tend lower paying jobs anyway. supposed kids home ignore work? can't pay someone babysit?

Listen, I'm schools opening can't turn blind eye parents really struggling concept children home. children young enough need supervision, supervision either going cost parent money (by hiring help) going cost productivity possibly job.  need understand callously act like parents care spreading virus. literally rock hard place. 
This new CARES act extension address somehow.

Preemptively mention I'm huge proponent higher education, however, there's gonna need serious discussion federal financial aid work. government, therefore tax dollars, paying full price tuition schools? Many students also get partial financial aid, many still foot bill government also paying lump sums schools limiting campus flow. 
 
Similar near future, COVID 19 pre-existing conditions within high education scholarships, alone ramifications.. mean really think there's gonna second wave like first wave? moment cases rise everyone goes lockdown neve full wave God's side can't wrong! every new case school kids infecting 2-5 others home situations. Unfortunately dumb people get put positions power time.

Yeah. Real star system weve got right now, chief. dont remember anyone suggesting throwing stuff out, youre right litterally nothing federal government could done improve it. Nothing helping coordinate, establish PPE pipeline, allow international help could ever come US president. federal government simply can't handle it! Instead, time better spent musing purchasing Greenland.

I see two reasons why. first people probably likely give contributions person. second churches worried might lose members give members reason look churches holding in-person services.


I know church seen 30% drop contributions since went online. think in-person rest mainly people lost jobs they're worried future holding back contributions. could least stop adding fuel fire making public health matter political.  could stop undermining people working end pandemic.  could stop profiteering fucking body bags vaccines.  could acknowledge loss suffering many people since virus entered country stop treating victims sort annoyance pawn suits narrative.  lot things could literal garbage.

Whether side effects worse covid infections debate. answer ‚Äúwhy take risk?‚Äù isn‚Äôt obvious. *kelvin Raised church- pastor‚Äôs daughter. believe God, must believe God created science, fact ‚Äòhis‚Äô language. Convince otherwise.

So many religious people simply morons physically cannot think critically. Trump drove home point Covid-19 denier instance comparing U.S. death rate, comparison deaths/cases instead deaths/population.    
The translation Trumps message is, since going away, government going much it. That's policy start. notified mid-Jan, Trump nothing mid-March, carried ""wartime"" president, fell flat face intravenous disinfectant suggestion, hid 2 months, engaged denialism. facetious suggestion. hand, smaller, senior level classes far better directly interact professors person.

However, Americans didn‚Äôt are. live school district. took non-binding surgery weigh reopening decision response overwhelmingly reopening person. kids optional digital (from home) learning.

There two separate problems- parents can't afford childcare, can't teach home bc work, internet access (3,000 kids county reportedly) computers distance learning- county longer lending laptops like March shutdown. people family watch kids, especially added onus leading lessons.

And parents could teach home, could pay childcare babysitters (who btw advertising services helping kids digital learning) selfish impatient lazy.

My children day 3 digital learning teachers thrown panic accommodate kids parents decided send kids back school 2 days digital learning much them. district policy told teachers privacy. Apparently impossible difficult parents find live? truly understand it. fall winter hits, it‚Äôs almost certain everyone get symptoms similar Covid.

You send kids, don‚Äôt to.

Denying children right education isn‚Äôt answer. people pushing openings like ""yeah, there's gonna outbreak, we'll push forward."" short-sightedness amazing.

Like know outbreak, plans shut anything. plan keep sending kids school, despite kids testing positive, point, literally every adult test positive. You, child, teacher dying COVID would million times worse. think take care kid passes worst thing ever, damn feel bad kid. quality part count? get upset much lower value money?

I can't believe people actually defending this. gives shit. ain't going away (until day election), suck up. forget ""the internets"". 10 second google search people think smarter 400 years medical experience. Someone please find face palm Fair question, really sure, though military installation. can‚Äôt look US whole, look individual areas get good picture going on. You‚Äôre right, virus isn‚Äôt, response is. It‚Äôs facts. cause you‚Äôre okay govt holding little shaky hand doesn‚Äôt mean others need it. Rambo expendable tight ship like Mississippi? Good. colleges cancel team sports coming year. Lives dollars, people! 9 year olds work inhale cigar smoke.

There little actual data infrequent cigar smoking. 

I enjoy good cigar, yes, I've enjoyed frequently. I'm worried booze killing cigars. people complied widely enforced, maybe. Ok, know kind wanted see would happen Trump became president even morbid curiosity think joke gone long enough.  SysAdmin medium sized enterprise. definitely depends demand location, though. lab area set run something like 6-7000 tests per day, enough capacity given population. cases kept creeping sudden got inundated something like 31,000 tests 2 days killed turn around time.

Meanwhile, public health lab kept strict guidelines submit (mostly outbreaks long term care facilities) ensure quick turn around time.

I guess point chunk people going mass testing sites get sent high throughput labs prone high turn around times demand spikes. ultimately depends sample gets sent capacity lab looks like America, too, go away like things go away... companies US believe would qualified capable rapidly building high volume advanced diagnostic systems?

Complex thermal regulation, complex control systems, complex optics, complex fluid mechanics, etc, etc.

You order factory anything, come back ""we know experts already busy working someone else already buying from"", expect resolution be? everyone wearing mask testing widely available, combined fact cases extremely low, really think something worry about. there's outbreak there's really reason think go back phase.

Someone go Yale. /s GA killing ... Well, here's thing: many people get infected. many interactions take place infectious people susceptible people. people interact lots people course daily lives become immune, transference slows significantly. kids religion tells contraceptives sex education bad they‚Äôre planet procreate. They‚Äôve got check box it‚Äôs big fat meh rest. NYC messing around wonder challenging would identify outbreaks involving minors though. Schools follow certain confidentially guidelines. kid gets sick, school can't announce student body. happens Kid small encounter his/her acquaintance, Kid B? Maybe kid lent kid B contaminated pencil small chat bit close. Kid B different homeroom Kid B clue Kid diagnosed? now, Kid B unknowingly spreading virus around school. people act like government going storm doors reality one gives shit them. ""core user base"" sub also predicting millions deaths US alone May, mass food shortages, end civilization know it.

It's really relevant either way. legal stop cars reason? 4th amendment? yep, thats unfortunate reality likely happening :/

stay safe! gets worse. back forth George School Counselor. get 10 emergency sick days, plus whatever accrued sick days have. wife baby last year none. run sick days go unemployment. clear pay COBRA insurance. ordered self quarantine near sick kids even means go unpaid. everyone self quarantine ability remote learning kids. School Counselors can't. go unpaid. 2 quarantines getting paid large swaths year possibly lose medical insurance.

This school board telling teachers go fuck themselves. Ill bet get gofundme's teachers use sick pay quarantines get sick 2 months , dont get paid, cant afford COBRA. Ill bet right wing schools threaten fire staff making GOFUNDME cause embarassing. Complaining something even report bit much. I'll remove one because, again, incivility. COULD SEEN COMING?!? want stay home dad even kids home. predict schools reopened, outbreaks, closed again.

So even bother opening them? stupid. Perhaps, lot folk happy him, even though voted in. However, see campaign/election another years since elected last year. 

He sure got really shitty year start term, though. Yikes. seems lot people assuming elementary, middle, high school kids independent live alone. go home care givers. mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, uncle, aunt. kid likely survive? everyone else? bomb waiting go off. burning ember blown onto nice dry tree. 


This tragic sad. Canada, landlord believe covid I'm move keeps wanting show apartment. also refuses wear mask so, despite fact immunocompromised family member.

So retaliation arrived next set potential renters, went outside took biggest, harshest bong hits possibly could. also made sure bong water maximize irritation throat/lungs.

When came back clearing throat, coughing red, watery eyes. Immediately began panic, covering mouth nose shirt left apartment walking backwards.

He then, 10 ft away, shouted saying ""should've warned cold"" said ""I thought believe corona?"" got angry stormed off.

So lot believe, simultaneously believe happen them. Yesterday, told boss (also stepdad) come office anymore I‚Äôve created uncomfortable workplace refusing accept people wearing masks office.. RTU disinfectant? Trump might possibly one worst world leaders ever exist. now, he's responsible death tens thousands people show sign caring anyone struggling pandemic, almost seems gleeful people suffering thinks either deserve else even view people I'm sure one scarier. Amen.  dude doxxed constituents? Lmao also granted good deeds sin life simply confess sins right death. God fucking dammit that's quoting works. *actually* said was,  believe .I believe virus exists strong flue kill old people ones whit respiratory problems.""  going end conversation now. express well written communication worth time trying figure ""was meaning"" say. Good luck life!  Considering that, knowledge, *fully* supported Ontario far, seems pretty good! Hopefully continues increasing, provinces hop board soon!

\*Note choose install provinces, get benefit adopting early! (ie record exposures meantime). testing children returning school. Sounds like right. makes mad sad time. church wonders losing members can't attract new ones. action match sermon. Jesus would put fucking mask tell people pray home hears everywhere. take second realize 6 months, 6 damn months, one administration recognized aged teachers recommendations today.. mean, I'm disagreeing front line experience witnessed. I'm disagreeing assertion behaviours primary causative factor outcome we're seeing. 

Surely behaviours somewhat causative idea larger effect 42% population immune (probably understated level exposure) highly contagious virus probably exactly due bias front line experience. can't help see behaviours link outcomes despite fact can't see actually real cause outcome. Keep telling that. course shift data handled perfectly coincides trend. moving 7 day average deaths started decrease yesterday. Meanwhile, top experts indicated states flaring seeing widespread transmission. virus isn‚Äôt ruining anyone‚Äôs lives. is. People adapt government needs facilitate that. Going back option vaccine. That‚Äôs facts. 23% according antibody studies. 
2 months ago believe. He's fucking going away! Right stat admins college students 1:21 across country, used 1:50 70s. specific college could understaffed, state school went sure wasn't. tuition would creep every year like clockwork.

The smart thing blindly accept cost college, ask government foot bill. smart thing make cheaper. 

Pell grants example kept inflation, can't keep cost colleges. 80s ""purchasing"" power could get poor kids college, drop bucket. Got reel bloat cut fat. 

If want read it, I'm pretty much parroting everything Yang talked run. get they'll feel worse friends get sick die or, God forbid, bring home reason parent grandparent dies. many places [some Reminds old joke two boats helicopter. 15 cases 0 time. sure gets decide 'safely' needed to... zoom parents kids got kicked month started zooming head shoulders whoever speaking...

Why get kicked told do? students classes pandemic getting ripped general. 

Why paying full tuition prices services cannot use/have? Usually pay tuition costs classes. get Library. Gym. parking lot. labs. etc. None use. So.. pay full price? Crazyland Lmao. ironic. give end month majority schools opened outbreaks close Tough decisions gonna made pandemic. Deal it. accept concerns. view important lives we'll lose reopen schools. Mississippi's burning up. Live across street school. Nearly Everyone block covid weeks back. suprise outbreak getting worse. county probably blow cases next weeks... Ya know, God sent trained medical experts help protect plague, right? agree there‚Äôs way especially 38,000 plus students returning campus. would know you‚Äôre going stop college kids college kids. appreciate trying tough I‚Äôm sure PAC-12 Big 10 groups come players support hopefully happen conference. Oh ya, going end badly. wanted point parent knowingly sent kid school sick. I'm sure happen though. love everyone acts smug boasts much smarter 'those stupid redneck anti-vaxxers' come anti-vaxxers instant someone like makes vaccine save millions doesn‚Äòt inspire trust level

Anyone thinks China making biological weapon targets white people distributing vaccine deserve breed. anything else, countless Chinese people getting vaccine case, make educated decision whether take vaccine based happens first. saw link submitted removed flair indicating broke rule #5 subreddit ""rule 5: keep information quality high"".

I'd love know article makes high quality information. Especially given [Michael Osterholm references article position surfaces significant concern regard COVID-19 transmission. Maybe it‚Äôs face, feel like gaiters subconsciously held keeping neck head certain way. prefer tie-back mask using clip connect two ear loops back head (also keeps nice tight), gaiters might work better me. correlation religion risky behavior really ironic Yeah, it‚Äôs messed up. lobby state legislators longer sentencing guidelines increases ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù base. private sector great things, there‚Äôs certain industries causes perverse incentives. Core user base sub advocating mask usage sometime January. least hospitals US tried sound alarm likely airborne, must treated airborne, first diamond princess evacuees. generally means hazmat suits airtight single occupancy hospital rooms suspected case.

And outdoor restaurants table set often way 6 ft people. May center one table center next, people much closer. tables sidewalks distancing pedestrians people sitting tables ether. yet active province. said that? thinks kids work? saw pictures stacked coffins, mass graves dug, etc, youd instantly think NYC point, thats happened.....and mist know something cases bad.... lasting effects Doo mer brains, whether contact virus. cut middleman stimulus (us), money go directly offshore accounts. see 50,000 cases reported day I‚Äôm like damn that‚Äôs low surprised already what's USA doing? Turning hospitals sources income? MSG? buy bleach dilute properly put reusable spray bottles. try use clean white rags wipe paper towels convenient. Can‚Äôt wait Georgia numbers show up... got call today northern Colorado it‚Äôs virtual instead 3 half days campus virtual Eh I'm still pissed.

Ny warnings delayed acting. I'm PA. shit job testing isolating nursing homes.

It's intentional hostile head sand actions see Conservative Govenors. still incompetence cost lives. knew enough better did.

Some positives. Pa done great shutdowns taking actions county county based data. 31 jobs going San Diego County, ""essential."" mean bother shutting US 15 Covid cases .... oops. [You can't Dogs get virus seen mild symptoms cases dying infecting human. rest us, shows messed USA country. anti-intellectualism, corrupt politics, abuse power, racism, lack social infrastructure healthcare complete unwillingness Americans anything it. basically rich 3rd world country one living in. Thanks understanding, wanted point out. I'm glad got could. I'm certain places dangerous bars, crowded get. behavior really bad. think decent people staying home, many bad ones. wish could get out, probably feet first. Well educate me, understanding reporting went White House, sounds like I‚Äôm correct assumption. 

It great news, that's less 10 comments lol. Good news allowed here. someone went school Paulding Co 90s, tell exactly expected countless deep south school systems. 

In 5th grade, told south would civil war, slaves lazy except running away.

in time spent maybe three hours (over course entire grade school tenure) talking evolution. bible study every morning, prayer morning announcements tho. 

Out three hours, Im sure good hour spent babbling religious disclaimers isnt true teach anyway. California reporting numbers coming state us social lives. Sorry mom. buddy took seriously early on, especially since he‚Äôs risk, didn‚Äôt attend parties friends did. friend clearly brainwashed thought smarter eveyone else. hope dumb friends see lesson. really hope never come across real life. sound like asshole work can‚Äôt handle keep moving goalposts try ‚Äúwin‚Äù

That's man.

You seem think reach 0 deaths time realistic goal. trying explain CA FL show restrictions masks necessarily factor cases spikes seem ignore dunk people make feel good.

You able look death spikes happening compare regions handling see masks stuff really predictor. Lots data showing fast downturn considering. fact, looks like protests best predictor. Everything place best could possibly come risk based demographics. statistician able remove priors understand apparently can't.

You're argument basically hundreds deaths day constant occurence. Let's face it, people believe God obviously wont take coronavirus seriously.

They low key believe person basically like Santa instead presents xmas crucified son damned everyone doesnt blindly praise hell.
Or version tan god, well people pilot planes buildings Gods approval.... moving on.

In logical, science based world (Fuck would lovely) we'd wearing masks, would socially distanced correctly start aware severity PANDEMIC none would happened. alas, MERICA god infested shithole pity brave atheists stranded slab land surrounded God fearing, Trump voting, mask wearing rednecks.

Also post overdramatic af, cuz fuck reddit could get coughed next week die anyway fuck ya'll. Start wearing masks PLEASE.  things don‚Äôt necessarily happen stepping foot plane, especially going ‚Äútouristy‚Äù destinations. Americans romanticized view traveling doesn‚Äôt inherently make someone open cultured. things come within frankly need away mindset traveling makes people better traveling means people closed minded‚Äî it‚Äôs question wealth privilege whether someone go foreign country not. Leaving virus unchecked far dangerous.  point extreme measures need taken.  Covid19 flu going good combination going absolutely fucked.  need get people way comply put house arrest put jail.  wasted 6 months people.  badly Trump handled pandemic rest country done much better.

Literally entire world closed borders us.  wake call everyone. Never ceases amaze negative sub is. People also want simple answers instead complex uncontrollable realities. one wants hear ""We know struggle, could different reasons, none control."" would defense production act done prevent deaths?

Hospitals never hit capacity extent patient transferred hospitals, emergency hospitals set hardly used, never ran ventilators either. Yep. Teenage attitude Imagine locked home, even food survive cut open freed master. film professor used call us ""postmodern babies"" exist reality everything made points matter.  I'll interested see end cultural shift many instinctively wear masks cold flu like many Asian countries over. true virus ripping populations way here. Response combination distancing, testing tracing adequate enforced quarantine protocols, masks. basically masks point. Like, masks pretty much tool disposal. still living even wear mask certain situations. Seriously sound like 15 year old kid can‚Äôt stand put shirt on. amount insider trading going vaccine stocks right staggering. Despite actual effectiveness, financials absolutely fraudulent. want vaccine much anyone, holy shit.

There vaccine approved general public use without solid data &amp; stringent FDA approval. 

Honestly dgaf vaccine insider trading right now. even little.

It much looks like going open schools. seems (yes know even one many) children get bad symptoms, let alone die, covid. BUT, rate contagion go roof.

I'm NY got test results within 24 hours term fake news first used describe Eastern European kids creating fake news sites claiming oldest paper town state, never existed made up. boasted publishing completely fictional stuff clicks ad revenue, saying really worked conservatives, that's started focusing efforts.

When reported, rather look inwards learn it, conservatives took weaponized attack ego, tried wield 'weapon' themselves, calling anything like want discussed 'fake news'. Similar learned word 'biased'.

The way misuse little awareness reality sad &amp; ironic demonstration worked first place. shit inferior. instructors change everything fly couple weeks notice entitled twit. best circumstances. 6 weeks schooling probably lead herd immunity mass graves.

Opening schools children spread bring home families- I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre expecting this, it‚Äôs going good. 1000? fuck?

Thank God authorities stepped in. Stepping house like pandemic would really excel anxiety. Either way though kinda proves schools open. exposed many kids day went school I've two tests, first false negative, called 4 hours test say negative quarantined anyway.

Second test wait 12 hours take test maybe 30 minutes get results pay 200 bucks test. really wild country bet. everybody wants go fucking yacht party 1000 people. us want share family dinner board game night close friends. 

If content Zoom birthday parties leaving house next 3 years, bully you. Stop trying normalize bullshit shame anyone even desire return life before. think COVID-19 vaccines released general public? End year?

Are booster shots required? frequently? 

Given short test trial periods, safe vaccine longer periods time? multiple dosages, boosters required?

Would recommend elderly high-risk groups get first rounds vaccinations? wait? first day internet storm barely hit Florida. number students attend Yale whose parents income meet criteria? likely fraction student population. would never, ever close border Washington.

We've pretty lucky virus relatively tame.

We might want think changes make that, another virus emerges, transmit easily.

Not talking masks per se, maybe stop handshakes, contactless payments like.

Specialists warning dangers virus long time question time another one surfaces. might less ""lucky"" next time. red herring.

So, something isn‚Äôt alive, invade living organism like us, attach cell, invade cell, make copies itself...when mechanisms that? 

Actually, already know answer. can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible. Viruses made cells cleanse cleanse themselves, poisoned bacteria, tissues. 100% outside invisible attacker. They‚Äôve never proven cause disease, never proven replicate themselves, especially outside body.

There yet enough nurses staff city school buildings, ventilation systems aging buildings urgent need upgrades. may even enough teachers available offer in-person instruction.
 
Some teachers threatening stage sickout, union indicated might sue reopening. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, contradicted mayor every major issue related schools pandemic, spent last several days loudly noting Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs plan yet complete.
 
And parents city‚Äôs 1.1 million public school students, exhausted nearly four excruciating months remote learning, desperate answers still unsure send children back classrooms.
 
Los Angeles, Miami, Washington, D.C., scores smaller suburban rural districts recent weeks reversed course reopening opted start school year remote-only, meaning tens millions American children learning home months come. Chicago, second-largest district, also likely delay reopening plan.
 
But buoyed low infection rate, New York City still planning reopen buildings Sept. 10 hybrid model, children report school one three days week ‚Äî masks social distancing required ‚Äî learn online rest time.
 
Even city succeeds opening schools, little certainty able keep open semester. One Indiana school opened last week reported positive case first day classes. Health experts predict almost certain happen point New York‚Äôs 1,800 schools next month. two cases different classrooms school could force closing two weeks.
 
The question whether New York pull reopening profound consequences city‚Äôs long path recovery ‚Äî potentially rest country approaches school reopening.
 
If New York reopens safely, could provide template districts virus contained strict safety measures place. fails, could send deeply discouraging message school officials elsewhere.
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never,‚Äù said Emily Oster, economist Brown University written extensively reopening. city‚Äôs virus incidence rate among lowest country, widely predicted numbers tick later fall, noted. ‚ÄúEither September, one opening there‚Äôs vaccine,‚Äù added.
 
The question reopening presented mayor governor one weightiest conundrums careers.
 
The city‚Äôs former position global epicenter virus made many parents teachers extremely wary school reopening. particularly true Black Latino New Yorkers saw communities ravaged virus.
 
Mr. de Blasio laid series safety measures last days attempt assuage fears boost chances reopening really happens ‚Äî try quiet mounting criticism teachers‚Äô union Mr. Cuomo.
 
The city also home vast numbers vulnerable children rely school food, therapy sometimes even safety dangerous home conditions. Remote learning failure many city‚Äôs children, particularly disastrous 200,000 students disabilities 114,000 homeless.
 
Balancing risks rewards reopening hugely challenging own. mayor governor‚Äôs mutual dislike ‚Äî Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs determination undermine mayor ‚Äî compounded problem.
 
The two men trumpeted city‚Äôs plummeting case numbers point pride. searing criticism faced waiting long close schools mid-March, virus already spreading rapidly, put high alert reopening.
 
Mr. de Blasio said last week believed New York challenge, calling reopening ‚Äúbig, tough job, one city ready for.‚Äù
 
He acknowledged many parents teachers fearful returning classrooms, said would reopen schools ‚Äî would close ‚Äî city‚Äôs test positivity rate ticks 3 percent.
 
‚ÄúThis way proving things right way,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said. Mr. Cuomo set threshold 5 percent.
 
The city‚Äôs average test positivity rate currently around 1 percent, though lags test results compromised recent data. Average test positivity rates parts Florida, enormous opposition school reopening, reached high 20 percent last month.
 
Mr. Cuomo expected announce later week school districts across state tentatively plan reopen low virus caseload. necessarily mean New York City schools open ‚Äî State Education Department still need sign off, mayor said make final call later summer.
 
Though governor frequently asserted final say whether schools open close pandemic, recently sought distance authority, saying expected parents teachers make clear whether want return school.
 
Though unlikely Mr. Cuomo veto city‚Äôs reopening numbers stay low, rancorous history two men schools prompted confusion among parents.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward fight Cuomo de Blasio,‚Äù said Peter Kruty, father two children city public schools. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going constructive. hope one going pull rank last minute.‚Äù
 
Even state education officials sign New York City‚Äôs final plan, yet submitted, Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs administration still faces glaring obstacles path reopening.
 
Perhaps chief among growing dissent teachers‚Äô union, helped craft city‚Äôs plan active participant high-level discussions reopening, recently backed away plan teachers‚Äô fears mounted.
 
President Trump‚Äôs push reopen alarmed educators gave unions Democratic cities, including New York, politically powerful cudgel oppose opening school doors.
 
Though one national teachers‚Äô union authorized health safety strikes, illegal teachers strike New York City. call members last month, Michael Mulgrew, president local United Federation Teachers, said, ‚ÄúI preparing whatever need think schools safe city disagrees us.‚Äù
 
On Monday, city teachers marched Lower Manhattan protest reopening plans, using hashtag #WeWontDieforDOE, reference Department Education.
 
Even educators say willing go back classrooms said concerned highly charged climate New York reopening damaged bonds teachers parents.

See that's point.  opinion.  data says that. certainly present evidence don't. choose believe evidence incorrect evidence correct. ""We need to.."" certainly subjective term.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide someone put context? else kills one person every 15 seconds? kid already test queue allowed school stupid people interpret ""I'm waiting test results"" ""I can't possibly virus""

That's EXACTLy happened area. tourists decided party waiting results. went 0 cases 143 couple weeks. even job, civic duty chose (a minority) people elected do. mom anti-vax I'm learning (correct) science behind vaccines adult. recent thing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine going especially dangerous quickly produced. tell still long way still required follow proper safety precautions. information this? information safety final vaccine assured?

In similar vein, also brought adverse effects trial participants already experiencing (I'm entirely sure realizes trial participants that's trial for.) provide information whether responses normal vaccine trials they're something concerned about? kind measures taken minimize side effects ensure final product safe public?

I would appreciate papers, journals, articles explaining said papers would recommend. excellent reading comprehension lot scientific literacy sifting research difficult unless I'm pointed right direction. Sorry vague asking lot, anything helps.

I think mom far gone nothing going convince her, still want confidence good science behind responses. nothing else, might least accept I've done digging I'm completely brainwashed. Yes called brainwashed. curious Canada got facemasks test kits from? Made Canada? know Germany abandoned produce facemasks buys tons facemasks China. California also signed new $300m contract buy facemasks Chinese company BYD. doctors stand behind ""KiDs GeT sIcK"" clearly spread children take back parents cycle continues. must sacrifice good almighty dow!

*vaporwave intensifies* I‚Äôve recently starting going leisure again, everything kinda amazing. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life extended private bubbles. New Yorker life figured would possible get point. someone works throughout downstate NY, mask compliance awful since Mid-June. I've impressed percentage mask wearers young ""progressive"" areas (IE:Williamsburg) predominantly Asian areas (Flushing). Long Island Westchester joke, poorer areas NYC joke. Yes, people generally put one store requires them, outside that, bad awhile now.

IMO, combination significant immunity extensive testing, keeping transmission rates down. Social distancing explain rates stayed low NY. Teacher needs learning. 20 thousand people (official record severe under-counting) dead possible *you* lockdown 3 months?

I think everybody knows fucked bureaucratic orgs CDC are. used IFR 0.5% NYC poor handling pandemic. even use IFR 0.65% (as favorite org claimed) 30 thousand people dead, 4.5 million people already infected. never used IFR 0.2% calculations although believe real number normal situations hospitals overwhelmed close one. biggest lie governement convinced masses of, middle class. convinced people middle class engineering prices luxury items *fall dramatically*. cannot *poor* afford phone, car, trip movies, pack smokes. 

Every first world country things priced way higher, luxuries.

[Look would education, housing, wages, healthcare, etc. stay high rise inflation luxury items fall years stay affordable?

To keep masses quiet, keep masses happy.

If one two paychecks away paying rent $0 savings, *not* middle class, yet millions called middle class Americans position. :( clusterf*ck ending ""in US""?

I'm almost inclined believe wrong country named. Saying ""She tried committing crimes"" response **dying** saying punished. saying deserved die committed crime. victim blaming psychotic. Value life. schools government-run monopolies first 12-13 years education, massive amounts below-market-price government funds distorting economics it, might actually market education. customers, choices, resulting constant increase quality decrease cost time see every free market. opposite see every centrally-planned economy. evidence suggests precisely opposite, idk you‚Äôre internet spread lies. getting 29% needed herd immunity? I‚Äôve noticed lot well. Like uncle diabetes lived super healthy life far age 70. aunt recovered breast cancer former smoker, hiked Grand Canyon last year 62. dad high blood pressure asthma, still fine 67. 

I would expect three live another 15-20 years despite ‚Äúunderlying conditions‚Äù, made far without dying. It‚Äôs beyond infuriating died COVID, would ‚Äúyep multiple underlying conditions, surprising‚Äù it‚Äôs somehow acceptable die years have. 

I used fan Joe Rogan want rant reported ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù 12 year old died actually diabetes, therefore unhealthy doesn‚Äôt mean COVID scary. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt comprehend half population underlying conditions yet aren‚Äôt dropping dead flu nearly rate.. hard shutting schools nationwide whole year? everyone finish grade school/graduate one year later life expected. Big deal. least they‚Äôll alive. Winter coming? 18 million cases world wide confirmed cases reinfection really think immunity??? Ok water wet? Need take cruise confirm guess. /s Hopefully schools shut then. [It's already whic country talking anyone know long quarantine? 14 days? normal schools start early August US? that's soon! sound risky, it. 4 hours dont seem enough part ‚Äúlamest generation?‚Äù Sure looks like it... anyone took shit covid flushed lid would far worse breathing too. amazing discovery, discovered stop reporting cases, number cases reported decrease. like words really express tragic situation is. states supposed help world advance better world. many % states become homeless things continue way? many without food right now... 

*wipes away tear* could misleading though. countries adept others data collection disease detection. 

On one hand, may countries lack human capital (hell, drain brainpower countries) resources necessary accurately track virus. countries misrepresent numbers. 

Even worst day, United States still pretty good data statistical collection, Reddit conspiracies aside. part back normal Trump plan make things back worse begins. People need clean spaces. room depending others protect contagion. really listened supreme leader slowed testing. Tah-dah! Problem solved! State local government ability make decisions - it‚Äôs foundational component government. Pointing fingers fact rose colored glasses nothing. done April, Dems would barked Trump abusing power. whats latest research, wearing regular mask protect wearer least little, i'm work environment we're required wear mask i'm one wearing chin

so protected least 5% useless wear there's probably karaoke! ""Let bodies hit floor"", ""You give fever"", ""touch me, I'm sick"" I've [keeping track](http://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) psychos since March. never stop doomsaying, matter happens. Seriously. fine (sort of) rescuing cruise people March. I'm like, definitely stay cruise absolutely go on. saying Agent Orange use Twitter? saying Twitter spread fake news affect 2016 election all?

Or implying matter got elected, outcome would've same?

Or maybe belong school thought claims 155,000 Americans playing dead conspiracy? Please, tell. TLDR; many Americans don‚Äôt give shit anyone themselves. 

And 1% case fatality rate complete speculation. current rate USA 3.3% based numbers have. Obviously that‚Äôs accurate testing, nothing yet suggests it‚Äôs low 1%. ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù see around freedom drag whole shit long possible federal government playing politics instead actually leading. significant portion population letting get away it. Wait till you‚Äôve identity stolen Make Ailment Great Again! Unless somehow f-ton asymptomatics showing antibodies immune cells, fucked winter. Schools try stay open. People continue holiday parties visits travel, god forbid scrap year's worth parties cancel Christmas. 

At first thought virus would behave like influenza similar symptoms. hoped would take break summer like influenza usually does. didn't.


The four common Coronaviruses peak January. know behave like coronaviruses. Seems like might. I'm wrong would awesome. Sweden actually nothing Yes. seems like outdoor situation really make difference. ton protests weeks end infection rate didn‚Äôt climb again. feel bad though small business restaurants close doors real weather chills agree extent, someone lived countries recently. really tough times virus exacerbates Nuns aren‚Äôt charge church can‚Äôt themselves. That's cost freedom, baby.

/s would agree commentor below. live New York City, population density alone accounts much initial infection spread, mention JFK international, one busiest world, slow/nonexistent government response time, reducing infection rates simple matter population inaccurate, doesnt take account myriad socioeconomic factors play addition infection rates. fair, North America continent. Finally something related us bro. kinda wanna try Canada. CDC said months ago surfaces aren‚Äôt large method spread. Reinvest resources air filtration dont disagree could done assist schools exactly suggest getting students desks? doesn‚Äôt seem good answer come with. two kids started week stomach churning. 

Honestly, best fastest thing think work fast hard vaccine possible that. Well NY incredibly populated had/has large amount testing happening.

Where live 1-3 days lot hospitals medical staff run tests (per capita) fewer people getting tested Maybe spark change never ending tuition inflation problem.

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Classes school start 2 weeks, I'm teaching. person.

You think schools gonna eat costs smaller class sizes, larger classrooms, free masks, extra cleaning, etc? Fuck no. Expect BIG tuition hikes next years. 

As online-only discounts... campus costs money whether used not. 

There great solutions. Throw pile. knew really anything malicious, unfortunate probably situation Trump's bullshit. think mental health impacts COVID quarantine relevant pandemic anything else. say someone disagrees author reading article.

Also, friendly heads seem keep giving 3 particular subreddits: removed posts still visible Google (how got here) RES. Removing doesn‚Äôt anything. pillow head? guy charged, given many buisnesses churches got money funds, seems bit silly go guys.  district south 60% person school. I've got N95 masks personal use, I've rotating them. go infrequently enough I'm worried virus still living masks, concern fit becomes less effective time seems like could still issue. r/NoShitSherlock School starts beginning August USA? definition metric knowing anyone learning schools. perfect, actual measurement instead feelings. amazing many people happy forget key aspect science (testing!) fit narratives. Well. guess already killed nursing home residents.  Good you. Way curb death rate. I'm sure someone profiting clear hospitals really benefitting pandemic. work one we've cancel elective procedures, even surgeons working like couple weeks, they're selling office furniture extra building space find. terrible  Less stupid people = good COVID-19 news. south fucked. We‚Äôre done yet. news fact managed get numbers far down. compare aftermath another day. Half people country turned shit hope die One worst takes ever Fair enough. think cautious masks distancing things like that, reasonable say let us want try first see happens. don‚Äôt understand seems one followed blueprint. went hell turned around. first US epicenter, I‚Äôm awe 90% states didn‚Äôt copy playbook. I'm sorry that. Industrial lords seem decided pay people little possible, without actually asking agree. started Early May around 1-5 every day out. 

Because transportation 24 hours needed time get every train, including many homeless, clean subways.

There 400 way, don‚Äôt magically, logistically make happen overnight. actually announced NY going early arrangements made free alternative transportation healthcare workers arranged. given free taxi rides work needed. 

Now shutdown happened trains still cleaned every 72 hours imagine city never sleeps crowded subways every hour. 

I‚Äôd love hear solution would been. demand tests down, still operating huge backlog.

They closed state testing tropical storm 6th, makes zero sense, especially tropical storm barely grazed us. know several people gone vacations past month - mostly Florida - fb posts help know avoid. üòï Funny, death threats involved helping Ebola HIV/AIDS soon somone mildly inconvenienced pandemic, death threats come.

Honestly, white male, I'm gonna chalk 99% threats coming ignorant white people always acted way inconvenienced. hate we've become... ""trying get pregnant""

And complaining others? LOL Hilarious see see part problem. long get want though huh? sound familiar? begins.... mess didn‚Äôt lot options. Basically hospitals becoming overwhelmed literally room patients. Cuomo decided send nursing home residents back nursing homes since equipment care givers available there. nursing homes agreed take patients (and many, most, homes already positive covid cases). lead lot elderly deaths. Still, I‚Äôm sure else could done. basically mess easy solution. freezer trucks dead bodies patients put hallways rooms available. two more, chilled freezer. don‚Äôt.  New York great spot right now, excuse death? example, extrapolate deaths per million New York State rest US, 5.5 million Americans would died. 

Now obviously NY extremely densely populated state, rate death simply inexcusable. Exactly. school essential business, open?  like, ""we probably wear masks case"" met ""SOURCE? SOURCE? WHERE'S SCIENCE???"" ""Det allra b√§sta √§r att tv√§tta h√§nderna med tv√•l och vatten. Har man inte tillg√•ng till det kan man anv√§nda use google translate article believe me. Sweden's leading epidemiologist. trust foreigner. Herd immunity covid known yet, sure hell lot 3% Newyorker here. fuck keep idiots out? Seriously need stop allowing people fucked states. Sweden *officially* take strong measures, people generally give half shit largely took measures themselves. really reasonable way approach reopening (or remaining open) face ongoing viral pandemic. Unfortunately, American reopeners overlapped significantly whole anti-mask/-science crowd, surprise things go smoothly here. Masks need mandated people wear anyway, virus care laws rights, take pick. West cost checking in. *thumbs flight. compare Democrat governors sending infected nursing homes? herd immunity finally kicking lol mean, 7-day test backlog, change much. means even farther behind. problem majority live jobs are, small portion United States. puts disadvantage electoral college. think article supports point. post response? Perhaps language behave ‚Äúin comparison countries, Sweden much less others far shutdowns, economic restrictions, school closures, business closures mask mandates‚Äù. 

Or - Next nothing (in comparison places like NY people didn‚Äôt leave apartment 3 months schools closed 6 months). agree this. face covering better face covering. asked public use type mask onset. literally never seen anybody outraged terminating ectopic pregnancy. reeks strawman.

Even staunch anti-abortionists say allowed woman's life danger. That's basic self-defence principle - i.e. ok kill someone order save life. better dead.

People lived isolated, small groups throughout Human history. 160k dead Exactly this. put time, money effort developing half assed reopening plans know schools close again. would used resources develop remote learning plan. school telling prepare remote learning. That‚Äôs it. Still. guidelines besides prepare remote learning. 

One many issues highly criticized public media lack system take attendance remote learning. population work lack infrastructure system attendance individually calling conversation student. incredible amount work top everything else. still haven‚Äôt developed system take attendance? hard would develop app this? instead reopening plans change every day completely unhelpful far keeping students teachers safe. according plans shutting back two students positive, obviously happen. It‚Äôs incredible. like believe everyone best really right way go this?  Yeah - love argument: ""we ten cases, need keep schools closed"" essentially saying ""we 10 cases, lets reopen schools quickly get 10000 cases shut again."" People learn anymore... 4.85 million confirmed cases US according today‚Äôs numbers 159,000 deaths. means 3.3% confirmed cases lead death, 0.4%.

If actually look closed cases, i.e. outcome, see 2,663,573 closed cases 2,500,741 survived 160,832 people died.

That's 6.4% death rate.

I hear people constantly saying 0.1%-1% death rate, never know arrived figure. We're losing many can't cope reality change lifestyle months. politicians leading charge. Rich people can't sacrifice profit simple small window time. They'd rather us become even divided dying I'm process.

I'm teacher supposed start PD next week. We're closed wanted staff come Monday. emailed Principal pointed city nearing 3%. want people building Mon. means least 6 people COVID, many taking home them. Hours later told online. Trump needs held accountable life.  160k dead nearly 6 million infected even fall yet.  People need stop defending stupid shit like this.  sort ignorance got us mess first place.  Trump committed numerous crimes humanity pandemic response.  100% responsible state country stands today.  words, actions, beliefs responsible living hell now.  hive mind mentality accountability. parents sent sick kid school...

No shock there. time. point is, done.

It's irrelevant figure conditions safely opening things are. good reason skip classes worries. I'm tired people unironically acting like matter. say ""but young, fine""! No, that's works.  Yes, time money want spend. Don‚Äôt worry memorize 115 random product names, easy peasy. That‚Äôs clearly best use time today here's hint, nobody gives shit believe. Trump literally said would magically vanish one day like miracle. lot voters certain demographic believe way think Reznor meant. understand intent, reasonable responsible given challenges faced education system.

If kids can't speak English, need go private schools, can't afford private schools. can't afford immigrate. Exactly everyother western nation. conservative thread here's quote,

 ""It's rational expect Americans follow safety guidelines like asian countries *did much better*. culture obedience authority apart American society.""

 response? "" That's good point brought well.""

 Motherfucking what??! hurt brain reading sum us pretty well. mean society losing social media influencers survive fine. matters greatly. Symptomatic people spread far virus asymptomatic people. government would handle that. problem. administration's approach: *We've tried NOTHING we're ideas* actually really simple put context insane human being. truth is, sane staff parents want open schools Georgia, mostly democratic counties, lot diehard republican ones follow governor cannot get head ass. 
Either educational department national level school board state level, gung-ho reopening sace face followers. opinion covid-19 always been, cannot harm anyone, exist, numbers dropping, skyrocketing, bad, democrats liberals get you, pray away, etc. get gist. Also, public officials reopening even sending children school. 
Oh staff reopening choice. either follow reopening plan get fired. since Georgia at-will employment state. get fired job.
So essentially, staff planning person, inevitably virtual classes, situations student X staff gets infected covid-19.
This entire crisis actually portrays dumb average American sad. case bonus daughter. teacher 1-6 subjects bar sometimes studying teacher. PE crafts (sl√∂jd?) teachers in. company 70% teams working remote way long whole pandemic started, really best thing employee morale. Parents get around kids, others live desire. boss surfer lives Hawaii time, stay ski towns winter time, example. industry really carved working remote, i'm glad companies seeing benefit requiring employees give 3 hours life day commuting. Trump going need new chart. Throw away deaths/case chart using come bullshit work! country epilepsy listed comorbity well, haven‚Äôt looked why. would expected daily chart there‚Äôs least one person reported epilepsy. simple explanation higher reasoning abilities decision makers. Probably due case load. Testing people without infrastructure takes time Eliminating public health theatre good news. We‚Äôve known months surfaces low risk transmission... maybe put efforts towards air filtration /r/lostredditors recall reading anywhere lower levels viral replication sinuses indicative infectiousness.

See link case made Michael Mina. convinced Week Virology folks, experts pretty sticklers good science. Damn, wanna give cheaper/free healthcare. Bruvs hella insensitive n shit. ü•± Thanks. Hate like adding lot small businesses closing local families displaced. Leaving tons real estate open time people money, jobs, nowhere live. goin get worse winter rolls around. fucked. CoronaVirus likes ü•± Ding ding ding!!!!  wonder Birx happy testing now? ""Your honor, object! devastating case."" Sorry, 280K 270K wrote. know since live Varmland.

That would mean Varmland go 56 cases fortnight 14 one day good.

Local news reports 14 new cases today self-tests one bad condition needed medical care. also reported mostly people West coast (Vastkusten) newly infected.

&amp;#x200B;

The next days interesting. stops Yale students remaining enrolled, refusing take classes pay tuition in-person instruction reinstated? I'd do. would pay Yale tuition sit room Zoom call? believe studies South Korea .. Germany? evaluated younger children gets infected less childer spread virus adults less. ones studies got infected traced infection parents. look sources interested, think posted reddit least month, possibly two months ago.

Also one school teachers got sick one died. rampant, would expect teachers affected healthcare workers example. Better parenting would help things. Look, stop spamming us PREPRINT.

I'm New Yorker. read science writing living. Obviously, high previous infection rates lowered amount vulnerable New Yorkers. say ""herd immunity"" idiotic. also high mask compliance, easy free testing tracing, limited indoor activities. 

Its simple answer, look stupid saying is. God. I'm sorry. Trump elected friends talking fears Trump. friend said fearful countries would bad opinion us. said don‚Äôt care countries think us all. worried Trump getting Americans killed. idea premonition would come true. fff rely kids spread get it. Good luck that. :/ virus currently occupying white house needs go away.  Good analogy Charge Blight Brigade I'm sure intent trying hide test results different doctors. HIPAA laws still apply, would shared doctors coordinating treatment. hmm yes simply kill family mean, mentally scarred pandemic. see people wearing masks then, flu common cold. necessary every day never be. Look 1918 photos people wearing them. Shit, even one pics woman wearing sign ""Wear mask, go jail.""
Little know last forever that, right? surprised-pikachu-not-really.jpg wish. sadly that's case. Many Americans undereducated, educated anti-science/anti-intellectual believe deep leftist state conspiracy theory (JQ anyone? /S). third option grifting saying things paid shocker Desantis still waiting apology. Significant revenue comes dorms food service. understand students angry, mean, university do? can‚Äôt put everything hold slash budgets much. years now, unis already running online-only sections busiest courses, alongside face-to-face sections mean, they‚Äôve already worked parity credits, grades &amp; tuition already done lot comparisons learning effectiveness. example uni always runs 5 sections anatomy &amp; physiology semester, 4 face-to-face one fully online. They‚Äôve done years. Tuition same, grades comparable, exam averages comparable. online section reportedly hell lot work teach though (and also students don‚Äôt actually prefer format, to). 

Online learning isn‚Äôt new. Consensus research seems works fine students, fine students trouble organizing motivating stick daily schedule. Another major research finding online sections need kept small (low student:teacher ratio) enable sufficient one-on-one communication. 

The main problem really subset students doesn‚Äôt well online. Also classes don‚Äôt port well online all, like labs studio classes. Right example, med schools &amp; nursing schools still requiring applicants taken FTF labs, unis forced offer FTF labs reason alone. Ah, good ol days don‚Äôt want work anymore job ended cause lazy find enjoyable way earn money.

We can't prostitutes like you. Sorry, mean come way, saying probally made person risk sever case, made even tragic. Give break, they're bad numbers. can‚Äôt anything without offending people. People offended want kids go school offended homeschool instead. Stop getting mad parents. taken beating need help less B.S. SK, I'm proud them. also national election April one hardest months, got fine. problematic people there, masks already widely accepted since get annual/biannual dust flying China + air pollution cities.

They also weird culture ""freedom death"" mentality harming response virus US. sad US looks like people necessary means respond people willing risk others' lives selfishness.

And remember, economy shutdown got December. SK got shit DAY 1. US waited 4 months closing travels Europe, that's probably main place virus got travels tri-state area. Still 24-48 hour turnaround tests, contact tracing, even masks. US fucked. Well, we've talked 100 times, protecting you, protecting others. could person gets sick infects unlucky grandmother whose vaccine take. Think others, yourself. Screams 6'4"". Interesting, since cases Texas started drop day data started going White House news filled Teachers conserns them. Custodians? one of. open schools, close night. mop, clean, wipe, sweep, ever takes get schools going. I've never heard anyone mention Custodians maintenance staff. scared that's going on. much, we're paid, staffed. Covid serious. need together other!!!!!? people part always masked around here, good.

Absolutely true perspective. WeLl IsNt PoSiTiVe YeT.... Pretty much. entire city pretty much runs food industry have. lot local spots simply getting enough business. Nobody money nobody wants re-open restaraunts. 

So lot start closing good. Leaving tons real estate sale. wealthy able afford it. Evictions rise. Leaving real estate bought. People outta work, outta money, outta time. Winter catalyze all. ember. blaze. freaking inferno there. using variants six months. yet still here, stronger ever. sure President* Bigly. magically go away. One day. parent..fuck it‚Äôs ideal. I‚Äôm sorry; job quit this. It‚Äôs good, ok. child special needs literally worst thing ever. Yes probably. I've seen media there's one outbreak significant size schools since reopened. 22 people tested positive outbreak elementary school. That's much considering elementary schools country open, show schools outbreaks.

It's hard get idea much risk school openings pose compared relaxing measures.  buy shit they‚Äôre fed corporate political interests value capitalism human lives disagreeing. even scientific conversation badly US handling coronavirus response. ""success"" stories educational side mostly countries took seriously let public health officials offer guidance government funding safety welfare citizens.

I friend whose school sent home letter list supplies kids needed bring class, including 2 containers Chlorox wipes. So, usual, underfunded schools lean parents, add mad dash PPE sanitation supplies. btw, Chlorox announced yesterday shortages continue 2021. Buy American, says F.D.A... Thanks sharing perspective. I've chance truly q stay home parent every day 10 days row wife q cruise mom friends.

I loved it. loved instant gratification task, done house looked nicer.

I loved spend time kids, planning silly adventures us like q treasure hunt house. 

And loved able get done home help get caught laundry, dishes, vaccuming, etc. wife got nice break well deserved.

But, 1 week. know that's like long haul. I'm also patient, fault maybe, get frustrated million questions, spills, fighting, etc. see time shine help kids learn work things. Ita always roses time good.

To contrast, work lot. desk job sometimes take 3+ years project delivered. Ots corporate stuffy. room ""be human"", emotionless cog machine.

Everyone different I'd truly live home kids take care day day instead corporate pressure, politics, 60hr work weeks, work done there's much show it...ots wholesome anyway like able home take care house.  *yawn* Idk. less year missing ""common core"" education, snack time, cafeteria pizza sets kid lifetime failure, says parents kids importance school.

And yes, get kids need socialize (yet let spend life ipad playing minecraft kids...) ways address dont involve shoving incubator.

And yes, get kids need school eat, let's pay parents slave wages, deliver school lunches homes meantime. Instead shoving incubator. takes absurd. someone else lives New York City, also hard no. Correct. Science peeking mind God. Trump everything power kneecap attempts various states sort effective pandemic response.  Ukraine immediately started citizens trading life saving medical equipment funds testing exchange praise public demonstrations obedience towards him.

Yep. op hypocrite already suffering pandemic. need burn crisp! (Who kidding, go it!) covid-19 folks covid-1 Huh? Lighting jokes turn sometimes.

Staying home going much effective controlling virus measures mentioned. obese pandemic started, going take many months even year rigorous weight management get healthy. definitely want exposing mean time. Even obese, still risk complications virus.  trending advice social media days ""don't give shit anyone thinks"" ""do whatever want, live once"".

There truth apply everything life. issue repeated many times many different ""gurus"" creating extreme culture reckless selfishness.

Utah kinda awkward place right it‚Äôs difficult tell right now.

Testing dropped, cases dropping, positivity remains 10%, hospitalizations plateauing, deaths increasing slightly. kinda happened bad time July holiday month Utah, data switch HHS, mask mandates end June populous county 50% population. it‚Äôs difficult tell factor specifically affecting numbers right now.

I agree delay testing. Family member took 10 days result arrive, already recovered time got positive back. 

I want formula using, reason hide it. would literally better mass quit instead striking. Sure state may hire back, pension (even years old) worth risk needing find new employment. actually private schooling. Private schools including universities attract large amount foreigners, send kids large sums US schools. hundred billion dollar industry. open schools autumn seasons, private schools universities charge foreign domestic students semester, even move teaching online courses.

That children, parents well teachers put risk, collateral damage.

Pretty unbelievable, huh? one could've ever saw coming. /s states entered pact reduce testing times. one-third Afghanistan‚Äôs population, roughly 10 million people, likely infected coronavirus recovered, health ministry NOWFlorida Wednesday surpassed 500,000 virus cases, joining California two states record high parents teachers opposed hybrid model, Chicago schools reopen online school students Chicago, nation‚Äôs third-largest district, begin academic year remotely September, leaving New York City major school system country try offer in-person classes schools start Lori Lightfoot Chicago Dr. Janice Jackson, chief executive Chicago Public Schools, made announcement Wednesday morning, Chicago Teachers Union midst tentative preparations strike school guided science, period,‚Äù Ms. Lightfoot said. ‚ÄúWhen announced potential hybrid model weeks ago, different place arc pandemic.‚Äù added, ‚ÄúThis easy decision school district originally planned open using hybrid model, students divided pods 15 children attending in-person classes two days many parents teachers opposed plan, arguing would spread coronavirus schools neighborhoods.

Japan cases control.

Yeah 41% seems immovable base. terrifying considering like 330 million people. 330(0.41)= 135.3 million people either dumb, racist, assholes, buy bullshit fox news (state media running administration propaganda talking points) peddling want keep risk low, keeping schools closed enough. need let parents stay home provide safe, affordable childcare, least elementary age. Otherwise, kids going form childcare, often less regulated, still moving around significant educational harm top. doubting schools close enter another wave, another wave coming? put quack hip

That‚Äôs called mom. needs therapies can‚Äôt provide home. Simple that. deserves every chance successful instead alive. think they'll shut October teachers die kids get really sick. gone wind Finland talk sports close full capacity starting October. 

But cases already gone last couple days eased things much like Japan actually happen. fine - except hundreds people die every day! caught cold, thankfully Covid. could wear hazmat suits?  .....

Duh check Lymes. Next come dead second graders, highschool kids, teachers, coaches, lunch staff, admins.... NBA MLB NHL desperate get playoffs. That's sports get big bulk tv revenue. Without post season little bit disaster leagues financially. Sorry wrong. People writing wills. wrote became parent. go work exposing sick patients every day. Sorry. right wrong. pay people jobs scared. Kids don‚Äôt need go school. else? Masks **not** substitute social distancing. individual high-risk group responsibility stay safe. Even afraid dying yourself, still responsibility add incredibly difficult situation health care system in. Keep curve down!

But good news! stay complete isolation! meet people, outside keep distance. share food/utilities/etc. symptoms, stay home! never ever believe mask kind substitute keeping distance, absolutely isn't. going continually move goal posts.

First student tests positive.

Then 1% school tests positive.

Then teacher tests positive.

Then 5% school tests positive.

Then anyone gets hospitalized.

Then one dies.

Then say ""It is"" continue sending kids school kids bring Rona home unknowingly kill parents grandparents. think going happen?
Idiots! they're opportunists addicted wealth. easiest situation Trump could've handed. literally required know fuck Coronavirus new he's damn virologist. 

All listen fucking experts, keep opinions himself, reallocated fraction military spending help keep people small businesses afloat. That's it. Listen experts take necessary precautions. Likely would've even gotten re-elected tbh. 

But no. tripled military spending, sent secret police fire civilians, paid rich friends, held dumbass ""do want, fuckers"" rally Tulsa, told entire health industry suck n get work, told unemployed send children school die get back work ""it is"". need dragged streets crimes humanity fuckin treason. Nope, incomplete, says article: ""These lists inclusive""

The page linked also notes sinusitis complication (which cause loss taste smell) hammers pretty heavily home flu causing pneumonia difficulty breathing.

Don't mistake personally picking information existing.

Again what's unusual Covid sheer increases virulence frequency symptoms, existence. much likely die difficulty breathing Covid, degree loss taste/smell occurs extraordinarily high degree cases generally stronger effect, making strong predictor, symptom wise. scientific consensus it‚Äôs return school (depending numbers cases). don‚Äôt agree. crime convicted of? ignore news together. Nazi Germany great propaganda machine one Trump even better since paid China Russia.  
These kind people get 100% news Fox Facebook. long barrel gasoline doesn‚Äôt oxygen won‚Äôt explode. That‚Äôs schools take it. 

We 1 teacher 1 student tested positive past week. school saying 24hrs last symptoms they‚Äôre free come back. sick people telling I‚Äôm 30s covid won‚Äôt kill me.

These people clue like deal chronic health issues. deal celiac rheumatoid arthritis I'm 34. I've flare ups bad became severely depressed too. life ongoing battle manage conditions. certainly need want added debilitating health issues.
Pisses people take good health granted blow serious. Here's thing kid 99.97% even feeling it. However true cause family members get maybe.

However read somewhere folks get mild case covid asymptomatic necessary carriers virus.

Basically much still unknown covid come real solution. USA odd this. Asian nations shit thier pants go full martial law 70-100 cases per day somewhere.

USA States like, ‚Äúthis fine‚Äù. immune system already compromised decades defunded education. people touch stove. expecting WHOLE day? Let's start couple waking hours time Florida resident, confirm daily case counts looking like schools reopened? That's definitely something consider. wonder would work institutions like Yale admittance competitive? academically promising current students may be, imagine university would rather admit students would otherwise slightly beaten peers reserve limited space students promising return year.  study terminated early? Thoughts this? families *have* work keep roof kid‚Äôs heads? It‚Äôs horseshit one way bullshit other. fucking GOP refuses help, mean...*what do?* Ah, sorry. mixed up.

Take upvote brainfart.... Shit, real disability catch dead airplane without least two layers masking. that's asthma.  mean yeah pretending understand could happen. wrong. Thank you! I'm betting child prior starting school develop symptoms would suggest needing test soon. I'm shocked.  schools planning reopen well, guess start preparing wave 2 Canada, things starting look somewhat good. Sigh. problem stupid people run country, can't ignore them. Damn questions insanely date Even schools, kid comes home school, they‚Äôre around parents, touching everything. Next thing know parents got virus go work spread workplace. mean come on, lmao, see coming? Kids kids touchy feely, know kid. Back March, virus small America, schools shut immediately, virus worse, suddenly think they‚Äôre prepared? Florida Man strikes thing could look determine going happen! Oh woe me! voted prison reform guy state's primary lost landslide. country deeply disturbed. tested positive second day, likely caught interaction school started, school Oh that's messed eh? know subs still live older parents income stable. Knowing Rona school horrible.

I recently worked school 1 kid got tuberculosis, crazy...but time also deal bomb threats stuff kids sometimes fades background. tone pragmatic normally support that. However, doesn‚Äôt hold true considering generations Americans following model family life hundreds years. Saying conditions aren‚Äôt ‚Äúideal‚Äù putting lightly opinion. phrase ‚Äúit takes village‚Äù worldly sense across societies regions planet, see form adoption mentality. Like said comment, parenting hard damn well better planning working hard keep together. said, acknowledge dirtbag citizens act irresponsibly family choices burden system even already ‚Äî minority (in US), matter vocal group may be. ask dude thing.

It matter. cases decreasing number new cases today lowest we've since June. We've 1,000 new cases day dipping 1,000 consistently big deal. would listened experts let take point press briefings messaging.  pointlessly attacked harassed governors would likely worked regardless difference opinion political matters.  Basically would done presidents elected do: lead. FYI happens give government much power name ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù. well ""healthy"" dose ""they fog glasses"". kids' school open (our Governor said ""kids catch they'll stay home they'll fine"") get positive case point they'll shut 3 days cleaning. anticipate school open like week cycle open day two, closed 3, ad nauseum test kid get results day?   knew gonna happen. states opened waaayy fast, many complying safety guidelines, cases control. hope country watches learns, follow footsteps.

That said, great time childfree. Holy shit. cAnCer KiLLs peOpLe, dIffEREnt! Let's assume prove antibodies. stop wearing mask social distancing? still 6 7 weeks mess things even that. think trying appease parents, unfortunately. never opened, they'd told could opened made parents' lives harder opening. opening closing, get like ""We tried. work. Sorry.""

And really, small number human beings die this, totally okay. /s Hopefully go away too..and quick Gotcha, whats title trying say here? kid got school attending first day (unlikely exposure rate test show positive results quickly). that, kid exposed others infected test results somehow showed positive 1 day exposure. sure would able figure visitors coming everywhere. could track Orange County surrounding counties suppose localized tracking, going since mid May. hospitalization data accurate, start see decline deaths week so. karen fucking speech haha. Absolutely nailed it.  think better go get it. Unequivocally yes... Holyshit dogs cool see big potential negative this: 

people get vaccine act they're immune, matter many times tell ""it's 50% effective"". means people party, wear masks, shake hands, cough hands shake hands, etc. vaccine effective them, they'll putting others far risk got vaccine. 

Not that, others going out, partying, etc. -- even gotten vaccinated yet -- enormous social pressure same. people able resist pressure. even spreading virus.

So question is, 50% effectiveness compensate people spreading virus otherwise would have? sure hope so.

(If test antibodies days vaccination, issue would less serious I'd imagine rolling vaccine fast possible many people possible take vast number resources followup antibody testing priority). credit, none responsibility     ""We must surely hang together"" basically Smh smh smh! must protect grandma! say zero Likewise! made plenty use one campus, it‚Äôs unfortunate truth good number students never step foot respective career offices. No, we're actually third world country facade wealth.

In 21st Century, first world countries universal healthcare, secure retirements elderly, free high-quality university educations, plans zero-carbon future, workers living wages, civil rights, guaranteed paid vacation sick leave workers, excellent infrastructure, egregious wealth disparity, legalized drugs free abuse counseling, support arts, non-profit news media option, lots more. middle ground one seems able clearly see actually happening. People see inside tiny little bubble think since okay everyone must okay. something directly effects life suddenly empathy demand everyone else same.

What people also fail realize every 1 million vaccines made 500,000 get vaccinated Breaking Bad everyone chemist. course first world countries Europe others like US able afford vaccines networks distribute hopefully save thousands lives. whole continents able afford vaccine let alone help sick properly. South America Africa destroyed ever see vaccine. Mexico right next US guess people start flee supplies run low?

There bigger picture definitely seeing it. user name like u/AlexaBlissBooty I'm sure never truly hungry scared life doubt ounce true empathy. hope survivors new perspective life world maybe get back right path. around April 1st CDC first updated guidance wear much like EU, suspect people US much likely listen guidance state health departments. Hence many New Yorkers Californians like wearing masks early Floridians not. watched state's daily COVID press conferences religiously March April May never watched single federal one. Gotta stay top man made social constructs big dogs say children academically, ya know. nobody ever heard move goal post account snag system. Ok, Republicans....

And ""unknown length time"" mention pretty important, since seems like might months.

And *definitely* still spread it, regardless immunity levels, what's usually lower risk.

I think people looking excuses relax guard get sloppy, cherry-pick things make feel ""safer"". think people nuance realize 30% accuracy rapid test real negative?

I don't.

People would think silver bullet abandon practices. Even WFH stayed % (it won't), everyone casual masking, distancing, etc could damage keeping 30% asymptomatic spreaders home. confirm. left job them. wiped seat buttons overhead. way company handled everything fucking joke.   surprising. everyone could died already. clothes! Yeah, university work dumped million half trying get campus COVID testing going, got away cheaply software department owned IP lab testing software, could get grunt work done $0. Normally project size scale would half mil software alone. Texas kids also going online, say 60% picked person learning. surprised see low, may school district level.

Considering white house took control metrics CDC all. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Herd Immunity achieved : 1-(1/r0)

Per COVID r0 1.4 2.5 normal conditions (before social measures put place). means herd immunity would occur 28.8% 60% infected normal conditions. loving normal conditions, number less.

Where getting false information tells different? bet major US media outlets unsourced articles claim unnamed ""expert sources"" say 70-90% telling Herd Immunity terrible idea. people xrying schools close extremely selfish care future generations students... may psychopaths idiot would've handled pandemic better. idiotic NARCISSISTIC president can't even put together proper sentences appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  time nobody earth recommending that, like uniquely behind.

Calling south 'anti intellectual' arrogant fact actually busy opening new factories rocket launches space whilst rest country keeps busy petty political agendas 24/7. Or, hear out, pay people stay home time time 1 month case numbers go high. Shit, could eradicated covid March country paid people 2k month, gave free Military delivered MRE's. cost would far less now. nah, Americans can't even think long game. soon shit started opening people acted like got released 20 year stint prison gotta party! brother lives southern bama. idiots, literally annoy shut wear mask They're seriously trying paint ""the south"" anti-intellectual anti-science. point huge swath US pretend like rest fine. Absolute trash tabloid garbage.

I can't believe used consider stuff like news.

Like obviously anti-science problem. anti-intellectual problem. can't pinpoint one area US. even one country. 

And here's really irks it. Part problem people get perspectives media sources way challenge instead paint together pre-packaged narratives them. Articles like exactly kind shit helps foster anti-intellectualism. intellectually dishonest. PhD using scattered history anti-intellectualism anti-science specific places make sweeping generalization ""the south.""

I care whose side politically. care facts reason, articles like come disingenuous place. I'm saying discussing analyzing history; that's completely reasonable. portrayal it. way perspective couched reinforcing idea ""republicans=dumb religion stuff."" That's dogwhistle.

And clear, I'm republican care ""fair balanced"" every political perspective. I'm saying, try intellectually honest whole point article people anti-intellectual. shit appear vacuum space-time. attitudes come somewhere. seems clear part anti-intellectual mindsets come desire associate attitudes people wield intellect tool looking disparaging others. like people walking around wanting ""dumb.""

I've using much ethanol sometimes feel drunk inhaling fumes soaking skin. mean like young people bar hopping, house parties traveling states? latinos hugged kissed funeral grandma died covid? rich people paid 1000 ticket charity outside concert distance wear masks? Luckily think internet helps people realise parents usually bright...  hard basic sanitation measures probably done anyway without covid?  proper enforcement mask usage public health illegal unconstitutional maybe problem existing laws changed. Instead want protect sacred little Constitution Trump wiping ass 4 years done fuck protect us even cost hundreds thousands lives.

We enough statistics data point justify harsher measures enforce mask use especially since literally best defense outside vaccine virus mitigation strategies know approximately many may die get infected unless people start wearing masks.  moral imperative country start treating blatant disregard life punish accordingly: murder.  think founding fathers wanted us use words allow rampant death suffering burn US.  Constitution laws meant change times one times.  amount freedom constitutional rights justifies letting 155k people die 4 million get infected. kind test that? antibody test honest goodness viral test? happens people don‚Äôt pay attention medical professionals warning us months. spread NY mean? Yes, get Reddit. south dumb Democrats smart... It‚Äôs even herd immunity vaccine. know what's Lynchburg, VA?

Liberty University. Home one largest universities world led Jerry Falwell Jr. correct, miss quoted statement.  No, get sociologist. get sociopath instead.  teachers essential not? 

It‚Äôs worst environment unless let be. Classrooms cleaned, social distancing followed, masks worn. 

Everyone else society adapting. 

On reddit nearly everyone professes efficacy wearing masks. Sounds like you‚Äôre saying masks don‚Äôt work, least schools. Guess what... Gosh feel like fool mocking Bush mispronounced ‚Äònuclear‚Äô. half US lacks actual empathy. going take 2 3 years 500k, 1 million people die. Soon denying serious numbers everyone know someone hospitalized, ventilated, died Covid. directly know someone 1 person removed. Like friends family member something. Home schooling curriculum actually inferior attending physical school. government needs subsidize computer/internet families need them. would far less paying cost COVID bills staff shortage. look viruses learn lot crazy are.

I KNOW, EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR THATS SAID MONTHS???

I mean, March said could see 200k deaths. we're getting there. almost like train doctors scientists kinda know talking listen them? got sick March. dealing brain fog amongst things.

I'm looking you, Neal Stephenson. I‚Äôm concerned dogs may get covid. don‚Äôt deserve it. Sweden failed protect elderly like everyone else. Why? healthcare workers infect nursing homes. one really anticipated - totally unguarded. Sweden banned visitors nursing homes, visitors likely infected - healthcare workers - allowed inside. He‚Äôs one closed country China called racist bigot it, it‚Äôs mentioned China town, that‚Äôs sad conclusion.

When people suggesting fly COVID-19 epicenter ""unpopular opinion"" something's True. Certain leaders politicized masks definitely help. things changed since people still refusing wear masks, even places they're mandatory. would nice 2 governments.

Then, 24 hours news cycle came by. needed whoever spoke truth whoever spoke most. Business called content crazy people never short content. actual fact checked, science based sources slow interact enough air around clock. Crazies stole scene every time. 

The reason today good news business uh what's wrong that? Mask, face shield, gloves, aaaaa, camera, tv. totally agree. sorts articles educate public possibly , empathy, likely wear masks careful. fucking way 4 big positives this. Three doggos. depends dose. Many people would likely mild infection never show symptoms, never test positive, never develop antibodies, never spread virus. technically ""immune"" technically get infected, functionally immune. important implications dose exposure. overwhelming exposure dose could lead detectable infection anyway. likely extremely crowded environments like prisons seem capable much higher infection rates anywhere else, also show high rates asymptomatic cases.

‚ÄúAnd us rubbing elbows little close folks,‚Äù Dunleavy said. ‚ÄúBut said, think best, best way deal conversations individuals, entities, businesses.‚Äù

The governor‚Äôs office said local communities decide best mitigate spread COVID-19 areas. trying get poverty. want move life. can‚Äôt deal living like longer. don‚Äôt feel good myself. true rich fleeing NYC crime wave impact tourism, left buy expensive designer items? dogs basically acing 7 answer multiple choice tests. study France gets false positives/negatives. 60% ABV good sanitising things, work 99.9% purity IPA ,or 99% ethanol(1%methanol) obviously ethanol denat. edit use stronger vodka, word.

You pass law. becomes legal. rocket science. someone wants pretend precious right wear piece cloth face inherent Constitution, file suit federal court. ask. What's covid scare? kind deep south thing? Guys. Germany. many people believe virus real. following Trump think gonna save us. JFK STILL ALIVE. get it. fucking fault! Must like Eazy E party Boyz n tha Hood  wilderness place right now. took camping trip take every year social distance even better home. Well, South strange place, states still lower death rates New York (which really stat matters). state South close worse New York New Jersey Louisiana. New York also showing risk anti-intellectualism?

I understand everyone loves pile South ignoring what's going rest country... agree there's lot Doomsday Sayers sub, and, true 100% effective test, that's pretty much impossible, kind unrelated vaccine. need high immunity rate herd immunity, 100%. However, lot business practices right pretty shady. hear bunch friends young kids. struggle. Alabama bad reputation think also decent concentration educated folks universities. Curse Lono true return form him. even Steadman illustrating lot it. Next campaign trail, great read, read all, even Vonnegut said ‚Äúthe tin horn politics‚Äù books Confused point here. NY‚Äôers fault novel virus nobody knew cared spread throughout America? Ignorant people like paralyzing attempts dealing pandemic rest world able handle effectively us.  blame wanting us bring virus back countries. I'd love watch parent's wedding video. destroyed got divorced.   post title misleading. Officials said many times case count due problems data, specifically system. said happened corrected it, figure issue is. intentional. said, even someol state report ...it's like every state every country LOL. even news point 100%. son high risk, we‚Äôre safe day one. It‚Äôs disheartening maddening see people move one one. Things getting WAY worse here, yet people keep lightening up. safer next zero cases. It‚Äôs strange. 

Even friends say can‚Äôt believe people stupid, eating out, etc. go post pictures hanging friends, literally next touching. partner‚Äôs cousin EMT person, she‚Äôs constantly posting pictures large groups people. Reassuring know health care providers come contact taking seriously üôÑ Yeah, happened late June. haven‚Äôt gone terribly much, noticed people gotten lot better since then! tested yet, work flow lab making burn super quick. me... everyone lab. get work ask, ""Who called today""? Imagine increasing someones work load 250-500% expecting accomplish thing. workload ER always guessing game. Busy ER = busy lab. Add covid busy lab dealing ER samples, outpatient doctors offices used getting day results... (phone calls every office town... this... that...why now...). Oh please collect 300 extra covid samples factored number employees. time catch work. time look clock. ""give 500% capable of."" Every night leaving work wonder stress worth it! going make health issues road? tell blood pressure starts rise jsut walking doors hospital used enjoy working! Yeah, much love shitting southerners, ‚Äì¬†here blue-as-fuck Chicago folks basically stopped wearing masks. Stupidity sadly bipartisan. country stays path surprised see mass exodus US borders open again. 15... I'd rather depend group professionals hundreds questionable parents. Many would anti intellectual, mask refusing people Reddit complaining here. Iraq War unite American people even start.  Yeah weird remember hearing child deaths either. Uhhh united states america. Dude idk well known fact public school teachers severly underpaid work do. Life death. Fear underestimated...plus gues people hope wind huge bill, something give it'll get wiped somehow. really feel people states. system absolutely sucks ironically greatest facilities doctors there. shame accessable Evaluate effectiveness distribute them. effective enough keep trying. Sounds attainable me.

Though obviously really mandate since people (like yourself) ignoring there's little repercussions (aside potentially spreading virus fucking someone else). ‚ÄúIt is...‚Äù

- asshole said I'm genuinely curious: anywhere still asking stay inside? area switched ""stay home"" ""stay apart"" months ago. encouraged go outside long keep distance, wear mask need indoors. Thank you! never thought I‚Äôd put position. is, guess. That's unfortunate

Suppose chose good time fly then. Definitely planning long time. That‚Äôs thinking too. Deaths max near 500. Keeping home might problematic thousands parents send sort daycare centres instead.  find DISAPPOINTING(actually understatement) seeing news headlines headlines idiots wearing masks/social distancing got virus speaking **deep regrets** **plea others** still disobeying it.

Some, yes, lot all!

There vastly this, period.

Maybe mainstream media blame, sure, certainly aspect needs covered more! thought process cant live like forever

Correct cant (at least realistically ppls standards) change. almost steep expect people set ways able process kind situation  Instead surgeon general tweeting caps stop buying masks SaId MaSkS DoNt WoRk goalposts dictated many dying. way many right now. Stop worrying future, nothing get better number people getting sick dying today.

You can't blame moving goalposts literally failed meet goals far containing virus. 10 days NY? recent got mine 3 [In case anybody looking entire Public Health forum put Harvard dr. Fauci dr. Gupta question led answer first question around 2:50 video; ""how family?"" question I'm glad honest it.

Honestly, panel looks like quality academic discussion situation find breath fresh air given amount political reporting subject. hour long first questions incredibly High Caliber.

Highly recommend watching video! kids? get wrong, single mom spent many days home alone that, 6. 6 young left home long periods time. Kids able handle even tiny emergency age. Uh oh. said dirty herdy wordy. RIP Karma score can't get idiots like this. I've trying 20+ years. me, basic evidence science makes perfect sense. them, though, actually care evidence care whether find one tiny glimpse one tiny shred sentence fits made narrative latch like limpet. dumbest kids *ever* knew met anywhere life. simply aged physically got social media therefore think they're equivalent subject matter experts dedicate lives science. that's probably going go single biggest blunder coronavirus fight. 2nd 3rd probably prsident closing borders governors putting sick patients nursing homes.  US really fucked one up. People literally refuse listen medical professionals like Fauci it‚Äôs costing lives. Listen doctors get sick potentially die. It‚Äôs really simple. 

Btw, I‚Äôm responding Fauci hate. I‚Äôm tired reading yalls tired debunked talking points Medical Director confirming it? going serious mental gymnastics. It‚Äôs many ppl think death count wrong :/ frustrating Trump responsible good chunk shit. 

He's literally started cult following fucking malaria drug. fuck timeline this? 50% nice step 8n right direction, think people rush get point, therefore make things like schools dine-in restaurants safe enough open. hope much, much higher 50% effective  even ground arent we? New York nurses.. stay florida.. dont want risking idiots here. Thanks facts! Um...I think confused many people New York State, compared percentage infected, percentage deaths... Finding seasonable Republican 2020 like finding someone actual makes money pyramid scheme. numbers lie, Trump sure hell tries. Bro gotta spectrum detect sarcasm comment. America way bigger number icu beds facilities one. nYC got overloaded points managed keep control saw. think it'd take much states :( still punishing low income workers. Providing money unemployed major issue going again. also wont help 32% employers cant fill open Um, yeah, I'm going get pitchfork 32 bucks. would GLADLY pay ten times pandemic rearview mirror. I'd reluctantly pay 100 times that! constitution specifically limits federal government powers granted constitution. 

The states restriction, constitution passed, great deal specifically designed make states primary governing body issues, great care taken try limit federal government, feared might reach become vector tyranny. 

So yes, much case constitution give federal government power pass X law, unconstitutional federal government - might perfectly legal state government so. Might want check math.

160000 deaths / 320000000 US population = 0.05% population.

That's 1 every 2000 people, gone. One worst rates world, getting worse day day, due nobody taking seriously.

What makes US different similar western democracies, faring much better? Lack leadership? urban/rural cultural/political divide?  Maybe world. U.S. ability track cases much effectively India Brazil. 

Because ineffective tracking South Africa India Brazil much higher chance much worst America. That‚Äôs 4 lift time. Crazy. Hospitals direct suppliers medical equipment. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre sending someone local drug store every time they‚Äôre short PPE. good medical grade masks gone early March anyway.

Nevertheless, imperative Dr. Fauci tell truth American people importance mask usage, chose do. yes, he‚Äôs patron saint everyone wants opinion.

Despite that, hope Fauci stays around duration pandemic need trust tell us things safe again. makes muppet I‚Äôm Kermit fucking Frog!! Ready use. Student tested positive first day... presumably Monday? Tuesday class room deep cleaned? 

I‚Äôm sorry call bill shit. way anyone got test results one day. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something. 

It‚Äôs three weeks still don‚Äôt test results US. Pointless testing. started seeing reports children thought immune less likely catch flabbergasted. Humans humans matter short. We‚Äôre talking -one- student here?? mean look violence coming past 5 months surprise. riots/looting/covid parties. kids getting heads blown left right chicago. aldermen homes offices burned destroyed.

at point every elected official medical authority figure like Fauci needs security 24/7. people get bored looting, burning buildings, defunding police taking statues going need personal security 24/7. article quoting someone saying something different article saying thing. kid got virus week ago school later tests positive? Groundbreaking. can't wait til election covid miraculously bad thought. Also, funny NEA pushing back teachers providing online teaching even. Gotta love it..so ask yourself, exactly ""stay home say lives tiktok"" gang really wants here? Exactly, schools know people still pay x amount name. Ivy institution long list people gladly take spot student want pay full amount zoom classes. Americans really stupid   
Source: America could happened? vaccine actually arrives, goalposts shift again, everyone sub continue usual BS virtue signalling they're ""doing part."" 

At point, looks like one happy virus completely eliminated face earth, reasonable people would understand impossible. trust me, I'm complete agreement you. long continue go on? going completely destroy foundations country built upon virus .4% mortality? draw line? 

Of course everyone counters ""If LiKE NeW ZeAlAND EuROPe CoulD DonE 1 MONTH!!"" completely false. Cases starting rise many European countries despite efforts. NZ, suppose think completely isolate economy years years okay? tied global economy everyone else, face MAJOR crisis soon enough. 

But anyways, / rant. use trying convince doom gloom people sub. honestly believe want continue society nothing shell former self. know charge federal response? opt hybrid. kids, least one every school district. totally random kids end rotation hybrid classes, chances pretty good matter do, I'm going least one child school every single day open. one mine gets it, spread kids. infected, matter rotate them, entire class, spreads classes (since banning common areas) siblings kids classes, back around whole school infected, almost fast everyone day, every day. people even point creation story different big bang + evolution. Starts darkness, light (big bang). fourth day constellations coming existence. fifth day brings water animals land animals brought 6th day. accept day metaphor easily fits reality world except weird parts (plants trees coming sun.)

As atheist confuses much bible gets twisted agenda, story already closely matching reality used explain God involved big bang evolution. I‚Äôm also concerned adequate expedient testing available everybody building. friend lives Brooklyn waited 16 days results. recognize testing centers labs facing huge burdens right now, school districts expected proactive get ahead virus there‚Äôs potential 16-day lag test result? decision Indiana school go virtual week student tested positive ‚Äî hear Michael Scott saying, ‚ÄúSnip snap snip snap snip snap!‚Äù Seems like short-sighted decision that‚Äôs going bring disruption people‚Äôs lives. Evidently not. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thought process? supposed thought process?? üò¨ I‚Äôm California. death 44% nursing homes. didn‚Äôt start thinking serious month ago. Nursing homes big vulnerability. add....our health department stated believe school start virtually, could send loads responses local residents urging school still go face face. guess depends are? see people Stockholm wearing masks compared April. significant numbers majority wears - April, felt like almost one wears every time go now, always see number people wearing it. even virus saying Quebec fair New Zealand island. Yeah. mean makes sense areas reasonably control, even exist US anymore, rampant community going last long without case. war crimes trial wrongful death class action treason.  Sorry, meant he. I've got 19 month old, wife made decision stay home mom could try keep exposed. someone explain events spread many people fast?

A church big hall usually close distance.. would someone wish ill dude relaying information guidance help stem deadly disease. He‚Äôs ruin business church life. He‚Äôs stating facts steps needed protect community. article LAUSD, second biggest school district United States, 70% Hispanic 80% received free reduced lunch. district, city, county state major liberal majorities. conservative seen miles. lmfao  children minimal symptoms covid19.

I'm sure that's real comforting parent's who's children died it. Like [9 year old prior medical issues. Incoming Fauci hate reason Yeah especially people like literally labelling murderers going school lol. chances happening still low. realise vast majority people, even elderly, dont die right?

You're basically suggesting putting kids prison case. hysterical nonsense. really need thoughtful this. Looking data CDC, February 1 July 25, 27,000 Americans died ages 5 24. Among 27,000, 200 died due Coronavirus. every death tragedy, administration bungled entire thing get-go, really need observe disease harmful school aged children also need thinking damage consequence keeping children schools. real cost deserves honest attention. True definitely soon.. way everything‚Äôs going hell much ‚Äúpro life‚Äù ‚Äúpro family‚Äù crowd.  Trump said...   Contact tracing much USA done volunteers. Ickkkkkk Hell ya ! socialist nations already invented vaccine gave FREE residents! Bernie 2020..24?!! Wtf people idiots Water wet. Scientists told you.  feel like another instance world Black people live every day US shown white people terms relate to. long 100% effective, pretty sure spread vulnerable groups would biblical afterwards. 
Nothing proud of, generations come. Come back September 2022 everything perfect. $700 covers materials, labor. need qualified medical professionals administer test, need laboratory expensive equipment analyze samples specially-trained people run lab; owners companies need make profit transaction too... virtual teacher, it‚Äôs easy us either. zero socialization person learning either. also tablets day paper used. Sorry ways suck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è dont think understand US constitution works. exact thing saw seatbelts. respectful. everyone OK social distancing you! Glory Forever.  Wow see coming I‚Äôll pirate it, it‚Äôs would want. definitely faked data start, partially due wanting admit bad outbreak also lack testing. Otherwise it‚Äôs dumb distraction badly US handled situation. Well certainly United ""chuckle"" States undoing, thats sure. even kill children ruin damm lives making suffer indirectly gave parents disease. Like get feeling next 10-20 years see biting back hard kids suffered point return. give quack man No, Dbacks dome, 112 Dodgers played Sunday. outdoor season Arizona unethical. waste time money anyway. think skipped grammar high school hell run sentence. shoot messenger? jobs done 100% virtual like school right now, nah? Death numbers per capita terrible even close top. MAGA Biden's campaign slogan - ejecting Trump perhaps important step making happen. administration wrong every turn. Person. Woman. Man. Camera. Tv. use excuse abolish teacher unions. funny post directly underneath one claiming YMCA sending kids death trap. Wish somewhere hide inbetween Bible says followers church Sunday

Hebrews 10:24-25 often used justify requiring Christians assemble [A]nd let us consider one another provoke unto love good works; forsaking assembling together, practice is, exhorting one another; much more, see day drawing near (Heb. 10:24-25).   Really wish Canadian version great job spreading virus fast got herd immunity anyone else US. Feel better gotten credit? trump said.... That‚Äôs bullshit know it.

Let guess, next line ‚Äúthey preexisting conditions,‚Äù like makes deaths less tragedy. COVID went Georgia
He lookin' body count
He bind
'Cause way behind
And wanted deaths mount
When came across Governor
Saying stuffs hoax
And COVID jumped hickory stump
And said, ""you‚Äôre kinda folks‚Äù
""I guess know it
But think masks useless too
And care take dare
I'll make deal you‚Äù
‚ÄúYou sign executive order
To make mask mandates go away
I'll make freedom
Lovin voters 
Shout: hail Kemp! Hurray! Sure, I'm writing response claims 70% infection NYC provided herd immunity. seen evidence that.

EDIT: one source, estimate 25% infection Yeah. dumb ones keep saying ""if like leave"" I'm like ""I can't let dumb ass"". swear people getting dumber. US case death numbers also demolish country earth. Hanging test strips...........can't trust numbers coming Oh, agree well, I'm talking 1on1 engagement kids. 


Like good ship many ports, trusty anchor must. think literally federal law unconstitutional? Problem is, years propaganda taught Americans anyone prison irredeemable. That's many states take away voting rights. ya go everybody, greatest country world remain humble teach others want try understand, believe someone masters profession. one able learn everything universe thankful specialists every field. ones admire ones willing share knowledge patient enough respond questions realize world may heard first response also maybe something difficult understand needs explained different ways different people. 3 ... 2 ... 1 ""We're saddened, sorry""

NOT GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE Don‚Äôt Dbacks play outside summer though? didn‚Äôt think field kind roof mother small backyard wedding (Ohio) Saturday, 25 guests original 80 so. wife attending ceremony, wife officiant marrying them. wife also currently eight weeks pregnant. 

When broached topic insisting that, least ceremony, attendance save groom wear masks, acted though tossing wrench entire operation. took actual argument phone finally convinced put health safety unborn grandchild perfect picturesque wedding... exhausting realize every day many people selfish comes virus. Agreed, really threw told doctor. Granted, Oklahoma lot people don‚Äôt care. 

My workplace requires negative test begin work, well return work symptoms shown. Yes. 92% concerned now. Sorry must already jesus.savior.ex Stockholm, parts Stockholm, might level immunity. whole Sweden. Again, effective, policies like mentioned would need implemented national level, state-by-state basis. federal government absolutely could afford expand healthcare, food rent assistance. Employers would hook family medical leave, now, well childcare. again, many employers could handle it. They've figured rest first world, able figure well. Good article! Though also means masks necessary socially distancing isn‚Äôt possible, kind depends full aircraft is. Even so, I‚Äôll remove comment, since circulation issue apparently doesn‚Äôt apply airliners like buildings without HEPA filters. article never said student got disease school since pretty obvious. realize catch cases testing, right? CDC estimates detect 10% actual cases. I‚Äôm sure point, years road I‚Äôll fine, foreseeable future. 


A world Covid bad means don‚Äôt fly According Epilepsy Foundation, Epilepsy affect immune system increase risk complications Covid19. Autism looked increased risk Cytokine Storms, neuroinflammation something already increased Cytokines? 

Just side note contracted Covid19, would likely (likely things happen) still alive. want know tracing likely caught it? child CPR risk well. :( long keeps R0 one get little imported cases, beat virus. Dont need zero spread. presume state don‚Äôt know county i'm pushing back notion ""it's Ivy League school, teaching *must* another level"". agree feature major research universities.

My dad want go Yale. wanted go Amherst (this went need-blind full scholarship non-rich applicants cost educational quality). thought crazy looking back kind see why. really? never heard difference story. local triathelete hometown intubed nearly died ER. wife two daughters also got sick quarantined home knowing would live would ever see again. he's recovered, family faces bankruptcy $80,000 medical bills long term care gets threats street wearing mask. Fuck everything that's done country. Well sure 0% chance giving anyone else. know Reddit general rules, think pretty safe wear mask seeing family. probably grocery stores, least show, really needed point.  
We going really wish wristband something recovered took vaccine. issue small businesses cant fill open positions. big corporations hurt mom pop stores. 32% employers cant fill open positions. parents seeing ‚Äî many say desperately need ‚Äî assistance child care, full school day, supervised activities school real-time academic supervision. would needed **return fully work**

Elizabeth Warren wrote excellent book ways two income family system often trap, where, like red queen, must run fast stay place. RIP us y‚Äôall Well, poos families can't afford 35 x 4 bucks, even lives depend it.

Also, miss ""agreed upon"" part? get water wine DLC? could use right callous attitude towards someone painfully died committed non-violent crime. Mine, too. much start with. find wearisome stupid, hefty dash selfishness thrown in. Can't find place put them...someplace like cruise ship would nice.  Take captains crew let operate whole ship since intelligent they've managed outwit world's doctors scientists, whatever happens them, happens.  know many would shed tear since people responsible prolonging pandemic. callers need hunted put prison. You‚Äôre ridiculous now. You‚Äôre making appeal emotion argument makes logical sense. Reductionist arguments like get nowhere. Unfortunately even city Canada think schools going get it.

Do think got one side? anything sinners left deal shit storm. Considering virus spread people show symptoms, asymomatic kid spreading virus school week two, starts show symptoms? assume whole school exposed infected? Hell, look happened Summer Camp Georgia, bar East Lansing Michigan. mean, pandemic might abate, ""Trump bullshit"" ""anti-science"" stuff blow over?

They'll harm endanger kid whatever next way is. seem like money ever option schools first place Yeah, right, order magnitude. Yup. pro-Union, option point. I'd reply further, except post incomprehensible. trouble finding work, perhaps improve written English skills. uneducated Gen Z is, put together coherent sentence, even speak English first language. cHiLdReN iMmUnE!!!

I idea idea ever got hold people. Truly bizarre.  crazy gets downvoted. Well Reddit tho.... Omg scientist changed opinion based available evidence, BURN HIM, BURN WITCH!! honestly wonder thought process is.

There one. plans get healthy? weird? Papers read press releases line interview persons. case SvD , SVT, dozen papers far likely bought content 3rd party news service. literally lack capacity feel others. broken brand humans ruled amygdalas. 

Dumb, fucking animals. Society needs rethink gets children. teachers want go back lol. making seem like shit scared lives fancy teaching environment. guidelines met education system believes safe enough go back now, you? 

what say teacher says safe go back provided certain guidelines met? tell stay home try teach remotely now. 

Well I'm trained teacher expertise completely pointless field know nothing about. 

on point shop keepers essential workers risking lives serving customers? teachers considered essential? ""Deadly virus kills people, wear masks""
Isn't complicated. That's it. someone get common sense empathy.
You've nothing trying avoid personal responsibility people whole time. 100% bet one them. don‚Äôt get y‚Äôall downvoting this. It‚Äôs probably truth. wouldn‚Äôt tested positive -after school let‚Äôs say- day one unless already it. I‚Äôm pretty sure didn‚Äôt go covid free testably positive end day. Get real. true things know Exactly, people know /will/ wear masks go already tired wearing them. Let alone trying get kids schools around person learning... I've seen several completely different articles pediatricians saying anticipate many fatalities MIS-C learned quickly identify treat it. far long term issues damage, hell knows... America nutshell:  pay costs kind loose term though.

An unsecured loan doesn‚Äôt mean much people credit. thought new law required hospitals publish rates everything?

 Also, bullshit virus continue spread people go hospital deadly ill. article say died Covid, say's parents thought Covid died. information cause death I've seen article. we've learned anything last four months leaders care lives, care what's going happen November. I'm sitting outside cardiologist's office SC right now. heard discuss co-worker plan send kids back school. Passed woman oxygen lobby.

SC fucked. Sweden closed schools grade 10-12

Right said close primary schools. topic article young children.

Corrected misleading statement ""they close anything"" Part children teachers need establish working relationship, students need learn teachers expect. 

My principal told us yesterday ‚Äòthe first 2 weeks, make long, everyone knows go 100% online‚Äô. it‚Äôs making students successful possible massive train wreck. Sounds like positive went school Wrong. argument could lead massive deaths. need see research viruses immunity fades? Well fucking time. never supported NEA teacher. spoken several former colleagues told thing ""we keep asking NEA step action"". he‚Äôs far contagious he‚Äôs symptomatic

No, that's statistics work, like said. 

He's far *likely* less contagious, also possible he's contagious positive cases, even symptomatic ones. Failed state means state longer monopoly force rule law broken down. Even countries like Russia failed states. Afghanistan example failed state, government control country. bad thing, least presently implemented, making people make stupid choices. Good. seems like NYC moving towards getting big handle this. Hope trends continue! one work. wanted catch ‚Äúget with‚Äù never wore mask work exposed us got it. sounds like job Jared. Top level thinking. Rational consideration options. Yup; call Jared. Jared's experience Coronavirus past 5 months, piece cake. told, soon. plan along no? think huge part appease parents community members think it‚Äôs overblown hoax. could admit that, tell people shut fuck up, could spend resources planning robust remote teaching experience. 

I don‚Äôt see another explanation. seen show Hannibal? Anytime Graham going scene serial killer says ‚Äòthis design.‚Äô think often days - massive death count lack data/info truly design. Selfish trash. know nothing Christ. I'm going prove point PhD Immunology saying really complicated... But

One thing immunology relatively new discipline compared biological disciplines (not going compare physics since know anything I'm sure hard) also immunology immune system since unique interactions every system body. Plus different responses different pathogens, autoimmunity, etc etc.

But really makes harder much still know. Trying separate interconnected webs interactions hundreds different cell types behave differently every infection every person.

It's truly incredible study love job, boy feel stupid lot don‚Äôt herd immunity don‚Äôt even know yet whether herd immunity achieved. It‚Äôs entirely dependent long individual immunity lasts don‚Äôt know yet. Nooooo shiiiiiit!!!!!! is, think. section presentation testing requirements long, IDK. Dude since corona I've stay home step dad. hard. daughter knows importance phrase, ""don't tell mother"". Nothing weird, went swiming secret fishing hole (behind parents' house) mom laughed us jumping got hoagies forgot bait, pizza lunch instead amazing wife made went covert ops throw lunches dumpster 2 blocks away, build new patio surprise anniversary gift. 

Kids easy deal teach. tell care don't. kid knows (i care). I'm going something, help not, dilligaf. Motivation key here. Think like reading Nancy Drew? No, brag read 4 hours talk finishes 3 days later. laugh getting 13 gallons gas going 169miles say would laugh able math. 10 mins later tells horrible joke keep day job get better truck.

Bottom line kids easy deal care, don't, swear. need quarentine secondary contacts one day, that's enough time someone get become infectious. probably disinfect areas student also seem common vector transmission. Haha!

Nah, dawg, infected 8 hour flight 10 minute boarding screening got them.

**TL;DR: FLY** scarier part incredibly low number percent people say would even take vaccine. protect people legitimately can‚Äôt take don‚Äôt respond it? vaccine isn‚Äôt going save us country stops outright denying science. wedding start New Zealand‚Äôs largest covid19 cluster, ended couple deaths including Grooms Father. gun head saying couldn‚Äôt skip year? school starts again..... students get taught next 2 weeks? teachers teach classes?

Online? Ok. come back new quarantine days happens then. Online?

Maybe plan online either going online teaching teaching id teachers students go quarantine every fortnight. That‚Äôs strong enough argument, all. friend New York wait 10 days test available.

Just keep mind virus thing affect us things consider too. 

so think pediatricians think kids go back school? 

Did see That‚Äôs great viz it‚Äôs good see slight decrease. certainly doesn‚Äôt account steeper decline overall case counts drop greater drop percent positive tests, still good. trying completely shift blame &amp; responsibility whole time. Lemme guess. also immature 20s?

People like think they're brave Patriots^^tm refusing comply restrictions. They're not. They're selfish idiots exposing people virus creating danger community. Huh. Who‚Äôd thunk? public schools area went 100% remote learning (Atlanta area). result, several families decided enroll children private school (that costs thousands dollars) kids go in-person learning. ridiculous almost 100% guaranteed shut cases start rising parents get sick, remote learning well, thousands dollars. | governor says SCHOOLS MUST OPEN KIDS MUST ATTEND that‚Äôs we‚Äôre doing


Because Trump said withhold Federal relieve funds schools open. Thays lot needed money States. SARS-1 shown last 17years we‚Äôve seen it.

[Disclaimer Look current data. base 50% immunoresponse would spread quickly does. ny I‚Äôm day 8 waiting results. h&amp;h rep said lab test sent backed nationwide. That's incorrect. people I'm speaking still fight wear mask, want schools open, want bars open, respect science data. entirely fault state. I'm gunna stop calling people dumb bullshit say ""unproductive"". every person America enough cause us behind terms management recovery idk think pretty put control us deal with. feds wont. Unless live Latin America Mexico even testing anymore resources, medical staff supplies.


In Mexico 1/5th medical staff tested positive dont protective gear.

90% people die Mexico didnt even get treatment ventilator.

Why americans coming here? Idk. slaughterhouse.

F world. Im impressed lack leadership overall. us betrayed governments still doubling bullshit keep pockets full.

Stay strong everyone effective way group workers show supposed ""leaders"" holds real power....unionized not.

We people hold power. Band together small number dictators say....and voila.....their entire illusion control falls apart.

The secret stop going along nonsense benefit us.
Too many CEOs pretending gov leaders interests mind ours. one gives duck ~~powerless~~ fowless.

FTFY Yes, point kids bringing school outside constantly they‚Äôll keep shutting school quarantine. Yah, I've never necessarily schools opening going shut every positive case what's point? Cause way shit load positive cases I'm teacher dealing bullshit argument since March:

""If police, nurses, firefighters supermarket workers it, you""

The first 3 definition essential, say want current state police, need able call someone need help. extensive medical safety training, part jobs keep people safe extremely dangerous conditions. 

Supermarket employees, there's good one. dumbass supermarket, get thrown out, get food supplies. inherent desire cooperate situation, chosen go there, need items there. risk taken supermarket employees deserves hazard pay, sure, drop bucket compared school, doubt supermarket employee would disagree that. 

Since March, going multiple times week supermarket, think seen possibly 5 children high school age TOTAL there. think is? Oh, right. fucking safe, kids much harder control situation recognize danger avoid it. programmed touch everything, explore, etc., feel sick, they're going act differently. Even get high school age kids, bend rules know damn important helps impress girl, elevate social status. ""If friends, start sharing vape, important share them!""... ever met 17 year old? 

Anyways, yeah, bullshit. we'll see soon enough, schools open long, long places hold force agenda? Every one arrested, charged, fined criminal record carry life. it‚Äôs intentional incompetence? would think grades 6-12 virtual learning K-5 utilize empty middle high schools help physical distancing? would need help transportation middle high school teachers help teach younger ones. wife went Yale, went CofC. got biology degrees. ""quality"" education *leagues* ahead mine regards. met many friends Yale tons people schools...still leagues ahead.

The thing prestigious schools smarter, start much ahead coming college. subject state school covers A, B, C, D...Yale covering C, D, E, F, G, H ABC already known entering course. Oh, 100+ students class (my wife course *twelve* students!) actually get individual attention want/need it.

The connections shit really good bonus top. again, thanks response! Stay safe keep good work! Good luck!! police whether people visit households whether park elsewhere? mean maybe chained people stakes ground? Oh no. someome could guess inccreadibly infectious disease would spread quickly crowded school full kids arnt able social distance sanitize regularly. 

No doubt entire class end week entire grade (probably even whole school cause thats likely contagious kid went). knew wernt ready open schools could planned accordingly kids stuck online classes another couple months thats time parents stuck home unable go work time poor little buisnesses go without workers pressure give stimulus unemployment money :( proper shut government cared people profits maybe itd safe schools open parents work children going die bring home parents :) ok countries gonna keep opening anyway worth 3-5% poor people cant afford quit jobs rely schools childcare die cause otherwise well make billionaire money sad plane capacity 300-450 people. Officials predict [6% US population It‚Äôs almost guaranteed there‚Äôs infected person plane. Except maybe didnt test positive day incubation period. federal politician anti-vaccine trump Looks like damage control specialist already Huh, interesting. bizarre, like would easy. Instead base essentially militarized us, actively taking country (lmao people claimed years patriots, obviously lie). least O+ blood? Sorry, admit I'm US probably see things differently. hear probably right ‚òπÔ∏è  Seriously. weeks ago boss several Covid-19 symptoms got bad ended ER. tested came back negative. still feels terrible.  


Last checked thousands people getting severe colds/pneumonia every year July/August... 100% certain covid-19. conspiracy theorists love talk false positives, completely ignore fact even false negatives. Thank bringing mask training. medical professional trained properly donn doff PPE use standard precautions limit spread disease. see people hanging masks rear view mirrors touching adults don‚Äôt understand properly use masks. way bunch kids properly. Suddenly pitchforks $1200 per unit. remember. 1st grade around 2006 everyone besides one girl got vaccine (her mom anti vaccine) around half class got chicken pox despite vaccine, teacher got shingles. What‚Äôs worse means shouldn‚Äôt get test. I‚Äôm sure plenty folks want get test, plenty honest people, get test quarantine, positive supposed tell everyone came contact with, supposed stay home work.

Means lots folks, best solution don‚Äôt get tested. Can‚Äôt lie don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs dumb hard empathize people shitty situations one going help them. Im going disagree schools Georgia reopened mass case counts within first week opening. Kansas? Seems like odd pick unless missed surge Strike anyway. option risk awful death. deaths. Correction: sacrificing education narrow minded views teach. It‚Äôs horrible. maine opening schools right tourists left, I‚Äôm afraid numbers won‚Äôt last.

I‚Äôm free. one seen infection like *We* that, intelligent group people things. like watching sport saying *we won*. involved. Almost everyone planet far level expertise yes, think need magical fucking powers force everyone required fucking stupid themselves. Also, disease *dies out*? future? absolute statement. mean say *should* die out? parents going vacation next week flying total four planes two layers round trip. visiting elderly family members. mother terrified virus stopping trip works public service job. suggested get tested hand. response ""I FEEL like it."" 

The thought able go trip trumps reality could make lot people sick, including relatives loves much must see. Neither parent teacher job trivial person effectively both. unreasonable concerned asked both, even it‚Äôs necessary given pandemic.  goes every time someone dies. Good news room people won‚Äôt sent home die. that's always job parent. trying understand kids learning least e-mail teachers questions. respond, go media complaints.

Good point, analysis change consider 161,000 650,000 LAUSD students English language learners whose parents may limited grasp figure learning part first, get past pandemic we're among worst planet, worry increasing social interaction undoing bit harm that's unavoidable here.

Also good point. teacher interaction limited, might better served getting work reading, writing math rather talking feelings. Eewww! would use pillow cases wipe toilets bathroom floors! Sleeping car traveling staying camp grounds sound better better! Well that's easy, they'll turn coverage preexisting condition. fixed. kid goes school already contracted it. good thing?? Well, US opening schools areas highest community spread first. areas low community spread opening slower, remote teaching. Hilarious people accusing others sheep bleet talking points shepards give them. one who's parents would let stay home themselves?  used spend weekend days adults fairly often. . Like remember weekends mothers work hours see Friday till Sunday.. 8 hours home 6+ seems semi normal. instant let guard back. smooth brains understand parents going vacation next week flying total four planes two layers round trip. visiting elderly family members. mother terrified virus stopping trip works public service job. suggested get tested hand. response ""I FEEL like it."" 

The thought able go trip trumps reality could make lot people sick, including relatives loves much must see. probably means right? takes 3-4 days tests detect virus. tests prioritized go front line (along with, suppose, professional athlete tests). Maybe you. Welcome second stage grieving, Anger.

Here already accepted outcome. nothing else funny.  willing accept government going kill us maintain profits. way.

Only way getting revolution. Bingo. think pandemic attributed climate change predicted scientists? student get tested symptoms without? 

If test symptoms showing up, hell parents still let children go school? Thank response hard work! think speak everyone say best luck! Never saw coming! Backlog cleaned yesterday.

He wife posting ton online spread awareness covid undoubtedly going cause rise one's talking it. Well, something failing economy eventually.

My idea go ahead close schools, contain children Pod-like containers cheap mass-produce. Pods safety locks, filtered air holes ventilation, children fed intravenously. 

This way parents get back work force children could stay entertained access Fortnite multi-player Jake Paul videos. Two girls know teachers, they're worried going back classroom teach... they're still going friends brunch shit so..

I honestly get it. Opening schools bad idea. know parents get back work unable work home but... going spread much rapidly now. eventually change stance going restaurant flying airplane too. know, science dictates.. We're still setting new case records reduced testing feel. know way many people kids shouldn't. think toddler/newborn early stage life me. get crabby impatient get atleast 8 hours night rest. baby would break me. However, considered adopting older child ever get desire children around. many already quit. bridge scorched. Administrators scramble find new teachers, they've able fill spots far I've seen. 

Striking better first option. IMHO, attempt appease stubborn (and loud) community demand schools open. school district saying, ""Okay then, let's see long lasts,"" ten minutes later say, ""See, morons? work."" Suck dicks rat sad fact is, force schools reopen, know effect weeks, far late. That's feel see Ireland ready open pubs 46 cases per day 

But people US ready open Obviously, get first day school - Georgia students surely get - schools like video saw yesterday packed school hallways. C'mon folks - distance learning vaccine. 'deflected' questions bother acknowledge. ask again:

**Question** experiences home health care workers caring older adults patients chronic illnesses coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic?

**Findings** qualitative study 33 home health care workers employed 24 unique home care agencies across New York City, participants reported heightened risk contracting transmitting COVID-19. Despite providing integral care vulnerable patients, home health care workers felt inadequately supported generally invisible.

**Meaning** COVID-19 pandemic, home health care workers experienced challenges increased vulnerability workforce.

Abstract                

**Importance** Home health care workers care community-dwelling adults play important role supporting patients confirmed suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain home. workers mostly middle-aged women racial/ethnic minorities typically earn low wages. Despite integral patient care, workers often neglected medical community society large; thus, developing health care system capable addressing COVID-19 crisis future pandemics requires better understanding experiences home health care workers.

**Objective** understand experiences home health care workers caring patients New York City COVID-19 pandemic.

**Design, Setting, Participants** March April 2020, qualitative study 1-to-1 semistructured interviews 33 home health care workers New York City conducted partnership 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, benefit fund 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, largest health care union US. Purposeful sampling used identify recruit home health care workers.

**Main Outcomes Measures** Audio-recorded interviews professionally transcribed analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes subthemes identified.

**Results** total, 33 home health care workers employed 24 unique home care agencies across 5 boroughs New York City participated. Participants mean (SD) age 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) women, 21 (64%) Black participants, 6 (18%) Hispanic participants. Five major themes emerged: home health care workers (1) front lines COVID-19 pandemic felt invisible; (2) reported heightened risk virus transmission; (3) received varying amounts information, supplies, training home care agencies; (4) relied nonagency alternatives support, including information supplies; (5) forced make difficult trade-offs work personal lives.

**Conclusions Relevance** qualitative analysis, home health care workers reported providing frontline essential care, often personal risk, COVID-19 pandemic. experienced challenges exacerbated inequities face marginalized workforce. Interventions policies better support frontline health care professionals urgently needed. People keep telling news. believe lot read topic. time err side caution eDgY fucking cumstains want Russia bad. either online open all. care says say ""Society must go on"" 

**People DYING.**

I saw posts Facebook saying Fauci investing millions COVID vaccine company get richer. People bought this. believe many theories like this. 

This probably explains people think ill him.

I feel sad Fauci people trying defeat COVID together. frightened coming months. violent right going him. crazy conspiracy types. 

You're argument also bad faith. Stuttgart. also flew Frankfurt days ago, 20% plane people using mask chin mouth guards, forgetting nose. People understanding 2nd wave kick off. would try get tested ASAP patient's end irrelevant, 48 hour turnaround time test. bad Prince Andrew‚Äôs interview Sixes Elementary Canton, GA, know two others tested positive. One Lakeside High School Evans, GA, another Harlem High School Harlem, GA, near live attended Lakeside 15 years ago! school system using alternating groups make less crowded. Group attends school Mondays Wednesdays Group B attends school Tuesdays Thursdays. Yet, two kids two different schools tested positive asymptomatic, meaning symptoms. Still, think delayed first day school help prevent exposure even gone virtual, say blame Trump said schools open would cut funding. think school system go virtual first half first semester school year. know Dr. Fauci, despite Trump trying discredit refuses lie public truth effects virus, virus never fully go away lay dormant somewhere someone picks again. need aware come around future.

I think gov helping universities. might call shithole Authorities saying South Korea get D614 mutation. predicting second run throughout Asia. Every time there‚Äôs leader responding positively huge catastrophe whether it‚Äôs CDC, emergency response, etc. they‚Äôre immediately seen either instigators people taking advantage it.

It‚Äôs brain dead consistent style thought. look Bill Gates. remotely plausible idea someone creating solution problem may wanted problem first place. matter little evidence exists people run sounds good heads.

People don‚Äôt want think actually analyze issues. Poor kids. kids can‚Äôt learn online. fool blind allegiance would average, right? know guy ER 2am? job unlike GOP endgame saving lives! selfish? Thank goodness made that. kid, like 60 years ago, parents' worst fear us kids getting whooping cough mumps. Thankfully none us did. knew people believe two worst diseases listed, because, like said, bad complications it, even death. went high school girl deaf related outcome mumps-related meningitis.  Remember shocked see happening Italy....then New York....now multiple states nation. horror everywhere many either numb befuddling state denial. Terrible. Welcome HIT do. Ya, fair point. trying select advanced economies populations equal larger Sweden. Missed several countries criteria: Portugal, Greece, Belgium, Taiwan, Austrialia, Poland. IMF PPP per capita GDP helped figure advanced economy. [This adds them.

Just naive bias wanting compare third world countries poor medical care limited ability collect reliable data, well small advance countries might skewed results based single cluster outbreaks. ideology? mean science? dumb idiot according you, locking people camps.  Every day wake read news comments. Every day continue flabbergasted 5+ months people STILL understand concept asymptomatic presymptomatic spread creates potential exponential growth that‚Äôs bad thing. complex managing life I‚Äôm genuinely curious people US function daily basis cannot comprehend really basic concepts like this. insanity, USA convulsing. Lol...but president said it‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing down‚Äù interview Axios. Ugh, wish he‚Äôd show leadership. July 21st Florida testing 60-70k/day

Today tested 30k. numbers coming down, ones we'd like. viruses take time get people expect, esp never severe one. viral sore throat took 2 months get rid of. happens. Hope feel better real soon. def apply UE time get better. we're number 1!

No, matter what. ask, we're number 1 okay BIIIG üí© Corona Karen lmao Closing border Wuhan entered lockdown built two hospitals ten days would‚Äôve saved 100k lives. don‚Äôt care hindsight. Let hear concrete plan going forward agree objective.  break happens varies different schools? Great. Show evidence. people partial re-opening possible lot safeguards. Korea schools partially open (my sons go school one day week) handful school kids gotten sick control.

In US reopening utter insanity due number cases course. looks like got downvote guy truck   Wow. case already havent gotten example, theres lots people country total pieces shit! poor man getting death threats. people realized cruise ship pandemic good idea? like going mall, paid LOT money get enclosed space many people. Next time, PayPal $ please? Well can‚Äôt start dosing large groups people drugs think might work. Observational studies show enough incidental data argue funding controlled experiment, well prove limited risks.  Vietnam: 95 million, 8 deaths. Thank goodness Donald Trump! June/July. And, luckily, position online learning. Others lucky. live Anchorage schools decided open all. I'm confused would. Seems like bullshit me, drink live Oregon, that's problem Oregonians. nothing thing though... even talking about??

wearing masks alone could save tens thousands lives! focused state vs. federal? real argument people autonomy. healthy people want give freaking private company leeway track via phones. setting huge alarm bells head. get it. Redditors constantly complaining wealth inequality government want directly contribute giving power already huge corporation. cruise? pandemic?? Seriously??? chartered Anti-Mensa Society Knuckle-Dragging Mouth-Breathers? Ok, sure, student also willing forfeit credits earned (likely higher average since exam invigilation obviously ~~had different format~~ went window)? 

If guy opportunist case thrown out. POTUS said yesterday. ""We basically say immune.""  average annual flu shot 40%-60% effective? COVID-19 Vaccine proves 50% effective would well within norm expectation. saying yes, stupid. Opening schools means people die droves reason classes disrupted within weeks. Typical narcissists Nyc hit first country almost testing. spread freely time nyc significant amount testing nyc shut weeks later noticed wide spread it
Was . Majority states luxury test appropriately see stood terms spread 

Herd immunity around 70-80 percent thats far nyc has. reason went nyc implemented policies lower lowered created contact tracing team. seeing bad nyc majority states ignored it. should‚Äôve learned nyc.


Nyc far perfect see certain groups young kids gathering public transport inside store everyone mask like months. 


[Here‚Äôs info nyc contact tracing   started quarantine breaches overseas arrivals, virus virtually dead Australia security guards started sleeping quarantine people going back families driving Uber well. thousands? lol (1) deaths, cases, difference would make?

(2) NYC free testing residents, get spam reminding available every single day. There's stoppage testing.

Do make stuff up, what? Lol, muh social life! üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Social life secondary want, primary need live trumps that. Adapt socialize distance digitally. Bet wish option Spanish flu weren‚Äôt pussies like many whiners days. would ashamed people like learned nothing suffering 100 years ago. 

Get fuck selfish douche bag. Shame saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù reasonable logical position. ‚Äúimportant stuff do‚Äù talking can‚Äôt done responsibly? IL response vigilant. happy actually right now, although can't say afford living long without job since leaders think I'm lazy want work. right - end May economy...  **I getting hoax calls since Quarantine started absolutely terrifying!**

I live National Capital Region ever since locked COVID, extremely upsetting hoax calls coming voicemail. 

**The first one** robocall claiming power cut non-payment next thirty minutes call power company right 800-xxx-xxxx.

Of course freaked I'd paid bill working home absolutely awful. called number voicemail. fake company trying sell auto insurance. screamed every curse word knew hung up. Called power company emphatically stated, ""During COVID, disconnecting anyone.""

**The second one:** Week two later, get call saying served arrest warrant. stop, cops know call ahead they're coming bust ass. listened rest voicemail. says I'm investigated money laundering. laughed fucking hard deleted it. Looked number. junk removal service area.

I want let others know going on. People know we're home know we're edge COVID precarious situation families may facing. stopped can't imagine legal, happening die heart failure spot, fucking disgusting businesses seeing fit this. ""Give liberty, give death!"" Everyone invite local elected official covid funerals. love taste coffee, learned years ago can't drink energy boost beverage caffeine nothing well. 

I double triple shot espresso dinner out, like fancy restaurants instead dessert, still go sleep without issue.

Neither there, glad also seeing benefits B12 boost. That'd problem northern states due winter... Even option viable everywhere. Republicans basically find talking point works try dominate conversation it. talking point favors talking point they're willing talk about, force every conversation pretend thing matters.

If talking pandemic all, starts getting political, bet Republicans going bring nursing homes. asshole represents large minority voters living large area United States President. Every think Trump wants higher body count? US wealthiest. Given New York‚Äôs nursing home order killed people Cuomo blamed nursing homes said shouldn‚Äôt listened order... Estimated 25% New Yorkers already hats keep good work, cynical side says kind like getting ass kicked shit talking assailant many months later. Yeah, county borders county students set start next week. Mine going. virtual schooling foreseeable future. Hell yes PK friend!! 

It‚Äôs strange- encouraged study sciences college (got degree chemistry), topics science relate Christianity simply limits.

Keep marching! Good ya!  Yes, struggle wrap brain around this. female mid-30s. biological drive family strong resource investment (time, money, energy) really priority? ask honestly. Would anyone buy new Range Rover make $40k year? think many would. child different? Quality life utmost priority everyone, would even consider adding child mix, proper resources place. want provide thriving environment, surviving one. seems irresponsible otherwise. missing? LOVE movie know people downvote definitely due HERD IMMUNITY.

Currently IFR (infection fatality rate) guessed 0.2% 1% (very unlikely). median IFR around 0.3% (Ioannidis et al) . CDC first announced 0.25% IFR changed 0.65% I'm sure number close 0.2% so. 

If consider IFR 0.5% (due hospitals overwhelmed NYC otherwise number lower) number people dead due Covid, 20000 least 4 million people already exposed Covid-19. consider 30000 people dead (which way probable) 6 million people NYC already infected. 50% 80% NYC immune virus.

If throw people virus kill them, soon virus one kill anymore. GOOD NEWS. mom big fan ‚Äúpeople die, happens. wish didn‚Äôt did‚Äù something Obama h1n1 bit weird theory dangerous March, spiking, everyone holds breath wonders why.

(Yeah, know: literally.) irrational say past 2020 we're going living kind life tbh Come see three months, remember post would difficult science chemistry classes lab necessary, still might best option. Passing time kids would viral nightmare. HE‚ÄôS FAT! Americans freaking selfish. even reach herd immunity antibodies last months? choice make, virus gives shit think  3 days symptoms show going get accurate result. said symptoms started Tuesday Friday would optimal time. 

Please try relax take care yourself. Self-isolate symptoms become severe call doctor/go hospital. Remember symptoms becoming severe unlikely happen, take care try keep spirits high! best. Said wicked, old, greedy order maintain extravagance. Yep, scientists speculating herd immunty much lower 60-70% originally estimated. ""The U.S., accounts less 5% world population, leads countries global coronavirus infections deaths. nation represents 22% global coronavirus deaths 25% infections Wednesday, according Johns Hopkins University data.""

Does anyone know numbers similarly proportion 1918 sunk new lows? I'm trying gauge screwed are, historical precedent, outdone ourselves. tried claim 5% city infected. called bullshit. Here's latest case/death chart New York nice result - done great job!

And interesting compare curves stats prefer wealth deaths thousands. rest us given choice get thick it, stupid see damage they're causing wear mask public socially distance people

What proposed would allow things listed, more. risks simply worth destroying civilization. people die COVID, flu, common colds, HIV, etc. work toward cure, treatments, vaccines, distancing quickly go away. quickly. asking much people days need school mental social health

Thank goodness there's nothing stressful sent home  might get sick cause teacher need school parents work

Sorry boss. Can't come today. Whole family quarantine. 

or

Misty, watch kids week. I'll watch next week, I'll get fired go today.  No, nothing wrong me. cold, school let class back quarantine over. Yes, did... much... (scratches head)... New York. ‚ÄúThe Corinth School District done fantastic job planning, wonderful,‚Äù Dobbs said Tuesday. ‚ÄúI think could real model looking things safely also understand trace students wonderful opportunity us work learn future exposures without doubt, we‚Äôre gonna have, every day every school opens gonna child, teenager coronavirus walking door. based law averages, we‚Äôre gonna see that.‚Äù

Sounds wonderful /s Heat rises Herd immunity coming well 70% researchers tested blood samples 2018 pandemic existed found Cov-19 antibodies. significant percentage population already immune mostly immune. Unfortunately, South Koreans advantages us, even adjusting Karens refusing wear masks ‚Äúma rIgHts!‚Äù

People countries like Korea, Singapore Taiwan, already likely wear masks, trust government‚Äôs instructions regards public health and, seems least, care neighbor. 

For SK particular posit living constant state war neighbors, also makes likely respond better national crisis. Taiwan well, although China doesn‚Äôt let nuke chain every 6 months keep everyone tapping. 

I don‚Äôt know seem take public health seriously there, experience visits. Maybe it‚Äôs living close quarters actually caring people part culture?

So agree US response crap, comparing US SK instance like comparing 100m race performance Usain Bolt. He‚Äôd already put work practice. like eat Cheetos. didn‚Äôt need run race know going come ahead comparison unfair. Pro-life party again! asthma, bad kid. mother scared got whooping cough, managed get complications. remember myself, first birthday.

What antivaxxers others downplay risks ""common childhood diseases"" understand small percentage large number still large number. individual kid, risk becoming deaf mumps blind measles (or dying either them) small. still lot dead disabled kids.

(The cognitive failure applies certain people regard COVID-19 mortality.) Even really high (it isn't, statewide even citywide), that's still third way herd immunity, somewhere 65-85%.

Also: antibodies last forever. six months means many, maybe early immunities withered away. Yes, need report know this, school, CS department study basically closed room full machines since facility staffs claim avoid humidity wear machines. sit whole morning every time walk room feel air, temperature different, tell bad ventilation + little space + crowded folks + virus = chance us. cannot true. India Brazil far worse. Look positivity rates testing constraints compared US. must far unconfirmed cases. Hope week nice car worth ruining life! üòõ They're politicians playing points. know before? mortality hospitalization rates much lower previously thought? MLB almost 11 billion dollars revenue 2019. could absolutely it, owners want spend kind money. isn‚Äôt close contact doctor immediately. Depending she‚Äôs overweight-obese-morbidly obese range could great risk higher scale one risk increases exponentially. Add diabetes needs monitored closely slightest change needs looked into. Think one stadiums retractable roofs. ...because everyone going die immediately, dead already. :/ Ok ok, who‚Äôs running page?..... use called binomial random variable equation. becomes real clear county sufficient case rate. nearly certain within month least one case. undoubtedly undiagnosed cases hundreds districts day one. I'm saying they're right, suspected 20-30% could *potentially* enough herd immunity something like that? Nah. putting Covid patients nursing homes works, Cuomo really screwed there. deaths means ran vulnerable people infect. economically viable  Alcohol solve problem pushes problem next day letting grow even bigger. WTF! guy trying save life! That‚Äôs part it, it‚Äôs also part expensive healthcare system. Italy 2,5% antibodies weeks ago, Bergamo City close 60% height epidemic there.
Not would much safer there, plenty visitors still get now, without much community transmission. Also, immunity start break now. I'm focused state instead federal federal government nothing all. That's understanding. Please correct I'm wrong. 

The tracker / 100% completely anonymous peer-to-peer interaction. 

I'd rather two biggest tech companies world responsible 50 independent apps developed lowest-bid contractors overseen committees political agendas. NY mass protests social distancing questionable mask usage (i.e. loose hankies) since end May endless complaint parties etc, yet we're almost deaths 550 hospitalizations state 19M people. keep spreading infinitely many people certain point, NY example controls endowment?

Are arguing Yale can't spend Yale's endowment run Yale emergency? think endowment exactly? Canadian feel oh sorry innocent Americans trying right things end get shit again. bought Lumin one. bit pricier (at time March anyway, since seems like alot new products aimed COVID UV sanitizing). $200 USD right looks it

One bigger points Ozone said doesnt use etc. sometimes faint funky smell something first comes like 10 15 seconds , place bought (a sleep clinic) said human cells (skin cells, hair specific something put wet) thats ""burnt"" smell them

We well gotten money it, used hundreds times sanitize everything it. great things like phones since disinfectant like lysol cause things prematurely decay, things recommended get wet like leather wallets, masks etc example lives mattering? Cause seen one yet. ""15 adult patients taken alcohol-based hand sanitizer admitted hospital. *All history swallowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer products.*""

And four died.

Not trying prickly here, article writer probably consider people would read still need specifically spelled out. bad, lives Pretty sure Israeli schools opened experienced major spread immediately. happened months ago.

Sweden #8 deaths per capita. 141‚Öî% fact paying quality. Educational quality dropping long time. want quality education, go small school.

For decades Ivy leagues (and universities) hollowing actual education relegating lowly work teaching onto overworked underpaid sessional instructors.

The experiment running post-secondary education like business led us path students less less interested learning university less less interested teaching.

Amenities, lifestyle, prestige things students focus selecting school. business respond consumers order remain solvent, universities long time focusing amenities, lifestyle, prestige. Well helps NBA NHL pretty much already there.

Mlb stop right opening day entire season get point, NFL. Realistically, problems MLB currently facing mirrored winter NBA NHL try start new season, since organizations players owners come entire season bubble believe Nice chin guard, Fauci stay healthy think symptoms? 100.3-100.9 temp ranges today. super constipated yesterday took laxatives anymore.

Someone comfort me? guess praying covid away really work. cold/flu season gonna look like year Covid-19 thrown mix? want person learning happen thing nowhere near wraps? God cover us times uncertainty. threaten politicians ‚Äúcontrolled zones‚Äù, hurt minorities trying protect businesses yes 100% hurt anything push narrative get trump office. keep thinking Smith quote: ""Ya know, somehow 'I told so' quite say it"" Sadly things don‚Äôt happen America Remind Me! 1 month cited evidence herd immunity. followed accepting true infection rate higher initial source suggests. 25% second citation closer 40% 70%, perhaps accurate 70% would provide herd immunity, believe have.

But honest, seems looking argument. Enjoy rest day.  can't hit constantly shifting goalpost

Science moves goalposts new info learned. Trust smarter devoted lives specialize specific area science since way realize dumb realize stupid are. stopped reading intermittent lockdowns thing June group testing? healthy happy child educator better dead one. Teach best virtually catch next year. Federal government make internet access available all. School use laptops also provided. Students always catch up. Kids take year senior year college years rewarding. keep learning entire life. Donald Trump Secretary Education DeVos basing everything economy. fix year, virus handled. virus needs put box working together, listening scientist stop spreading hate. One life lost many, especially child. thread farther calling southerners dumb anti-intellectuals. Never change northerners lmao That's seats fill, federal dollars get.

**They're literally using kids giving resource, giving parents neigh option. fucking beyond cruel.**  physically mentally fuel hate. time stop making excuses stupid people reckless actions.

These idiots cruise generate millions dollars health care expenses, potentially infect health care workers others, needlessly add burden already overloaded healthcare system. 

Take notice... stupid reckless, world hate you. skip school: Rub bacon hands. That's good imagination have. ""Asian cultures dicks others""....all China fakes cheats billions products ever year. Cheating literally accepted encouraged part culture. deceit selfishness. 

They sell dangerous, poisonous harmful products millions. knows many people they've maimed killed.

But yeah, dicks that. Really caring compassionate. That's wet markets, cause dicks that. empathy really beyond words. man obese asymptomatic? Lucky. That's done. I'm guessing child team. Probably true.

If remember correctly France also counts better, Im sure Majority ME/CFS patients triggered infection, post-viral syndrome becomes lifelong.
Sars triggered long term symptoms improvements most. Hate brake anti vaxx movement alive well amongst parties. 1,300 lives needlessly lost. Inexcusable. Well old people. Jk I‚Äôm Canada. shutdown worked. No. No, no, no. Hospitals need added stress supervise people want there. Especially responsibilities already right now. want community service, clean highways... dig graves. flying delta. book seat next flying solo. Even so, flights completely ""full"" actually much common think. go onto weibo right look news Urumqi outbreak see people shit talking autonomous region government every second reply. complaint Xinjiang government employing smarter fine grained district level lockdown seen Beijing Dalian, rather blanket strategy Urumqi cities far Urumqi without single case.

The criticism even catchy slogan ""lazy governance"", employing dumb simple strategy name pandemic prevention without understanding nuance strategy used elsewhere therefore causing disruption economic damage necessary. 45 people wedding. left country 2 weeks later traveled world 4 years. Worked obviously. world. Married 23 years next year. add anecdote list. early 20ies got viral infection high fever severe fatigue (like, can't lift arm lying bed). Got hospitalized, checked flu, negative. None assays came back anything either. Spent week hospital fever fatigue subsided. 

The odd thing could randomly wake night bathed sweat feeling like burning up, sporadic nights would wake shivering form cold even though bedroom nice 20C. went almost year, slowly becoming less less problem, got cold like infection seemed go back normal.

So, yeah, viral infections screw things various ways. study shows much higher incidence stillbirth covid prior. appear positive note reduction premature births. 

On probability, covid causing significant effect these, other, severe health issues whether individually infected not. existence significantly changed aspects healthcare ways people difficult time either physically psychologically. fucking late people like nurses would gotten virus control months ago.  everything life money selfish needs wants.  lot work nurses thankless underappreciated certainly getting paid enough even pandemic little idiotic claim money. EVEN YOUTUBE ADS WTF Okay, happens walk out? 

You solved problem, added moving parts Doctor. Diffusion word looking leads perfusion organs. got panic attack?

Just tell to....

Fagettabautit!! disorganized. Americans it, big! Please stop conflating me/cfe post-viral syndrome. 
Post Viral Syndrome become long term CFE, whilst post viral syndrome go away weeks months, CFE lifelong incurable. simply long enough know which.
It seems studies taking place right scans shows inflammatory responses lasting longer time- brain (causing fatigue), heart (myocarditis) lungs. 
It seems large portion symptomatic cases Covid causes long term inflammation. don‚Äôt know many people facing lifetime illness, conflate pvs cfe say will. Coming system can‚Äôt stop firearm entering school premises. Yet sure stop virus spreading rest country can‚Äôt? wrong. See below. Dying daddy Trump.

Where see proactive? I've social distancing since march, work home, wear mask, dont see people risk group meet friends outside 6 feet apart. Novavax fun company - they've able mfg crap drugs matter end day they're effective. point is, child school positive, therefore spreading virus. 'bout taking country similar size, matter state? Like PA: 12 mio inhabitants 572/mio deaths? Sweden ranging position 13 US. Go compare US EU, US states diverse response European (or EU) countries Tea Party killed republican party. run idiots. Eh - believe both? Kodak Moderna two examples - insider trading occurring public data making obvious. 

The person responded noted 'despite actual effectiveness'.

Coronavirus, shittiness, pulled back tons veils people used hide major issues throughout US society. Including excess mortality? US 50000 gap excess deaths reported Covid-19 fatalities July 18th. Including excess death way around? That‚Äôs anecdotal best. Yet known months children spread virus.  zero excuse happening now. mean like factory refuses shut outbreak quite literally take down? bit like impounding crushing car? 

Otherwise yeah, what? close leave like month stray virus surfaces died 3 weeks go back in. Covid isn‚Äôt magical - needs host survive anything days. Another good indicator look previous years data illnesses. Flu death rates vs now, pneumonia deaths well. 


If check data see insane spike compared past data, it‚Äôs good indicator deaths misreported. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve seen Florida data probably got woman running dash board fired - refused fudge data. It‚Äôs important recognize that, although wearing mask important, lack thereof far reason COVID spreading. Covid spreading due rapid, inappropriate easing social distancing restrictions. Mask wearing originally recommended CDC (or downplayed) known people would view suitable substitute social distancing. It‚Äôs meant additional step one take prevent spread.

Social distancing minimize time spent indoors persons related to. must indoors keep brief. Stay far away others can. minimum stay 6 feet apart. Wear mask enhance protection offered distancing.

NY succeeds NYC. north shall rise again! people south stupid. it‚Äôs type thinking (and it‚Äôs way forever; covid Trump anything else) made diligently try lose southern accent teach kids speak one well. doesn‚Äôt matter don‚Äôt do, rest country always always think Southern = stupid. üëÄI epilepsy can‚Äôt drive. I‚Äôve NYC places get public transportation unfortunately. Thats rich, recommendation CDC known publically stricter initially, watered direction White House. 

""On Thursday (July 23), Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), pressure White House, released guidelines reopening schools U.S. Apparently, guidelines focus many benefits in-person learning little risks involved,¬†The Washington Post reported. ""Opening schools best thing kids. also best thing working families,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Friday.""

Dont get cold feet now. current White House famous following science profit. I'm sure friends family fine. still said incredible downsides letting children back schools early without plan. I'm sure well versed science behind unlike rest us. Like said, good one. new york got shit together using taught middle school biology viruses spread.

New York ran people infect. quickly happening South too. telltale sign incompetence strikingly higher death toll per capita North. like GOP pays climate deniers. Even isnt completely true. plenty rural people grew went college pursue white collar careers now. live city hundred thousand stupid fucks put mask Jesus rises back demand you‚Äôre one actually think read you‚Äôd realize damage already done time anybody knew restrict travel. returned school yesterday bad expect. required masks, thankfully, can't always enforce every student. One administrators walked group sophomores 3 different times yell stay 6 feet away keep masks on. Every time left, huddled right back took em off. multiple classmates 'anti mask.' many freshmen I've seen high fiving dapping other. Even seniors taking masks getting close every time teachers walk away. school's best enforce everything, including optional virtual learning choice, working. Look forward ‚ÄúCOVID fee‚Äù tuition bill. That's interesting.

We seeing hospital single data point. Herd immunity without vaccine reasonable plan Public education, ""educated."" Lets bring kids back common core dead. think they‚Äôre actually proud it. Awesome people still paint regions country broad strokes ""stupid"" ""ignorant"". Meanwhile, supposedly enlightened portions country, people protesting reason COVID reared ugly head again. Laughable. Stupid people everywhere, region dependent. Internet smugness can't stopped something trivial human being's death. Politicians refrain making medical statements covid. Leave doctors scientists, professional reputation worry about. Hongkongers choose so, blaming choosing so? wrong make sure Hong Kong enough mask supply? Hong Kong really excess masks fewer people mind donating excess ones Wuhan, case time. Yes luckily government suggested instead forced so, care much supply necessities Hongkongers, unless blamed hard. months?

I understand this.

The virus potentially sit idle showing symptoms 14 days caught. (Although show symptoms 5-9 days)

A true hard shutdown 14 days would much stop spread. stop overall, nothing outside vaccine that. 

But months? 2 weeks zero movement would help bring US decent, workable numbers. IFR infected individuals America's decline last four years shows risks anti-intellectualism joking, right? (unlike Obama) born another country? person foolish fool fool follows him.  Technically! That‚Äôs evangelicalism. True evangelicalism means missionary absolutely intent establish church. preach move on. fault. created biggest anti-science group world, idiots following lead. Sure are. festers thrives southern culture. point trying make? New York got first spread literally every state. New Jersey basically New York, simultaneously. mean...

Rockland guys blue. Above?

We‚Äôre honestly fucked winter people don‚Äôt smarten West Virginia feels like forgot exist. Again. I'm sure followed news past 2 weeks, Trump's admin stripped CDC get data states getting data instead. controlling data becomes public becomes public. There's alot massaging done, many counties disclose resources disclose data. well problem sort started calling ""Megamind"" read books lunch break. 

Oh god, failed actually understand children's film. mean like that?

Sorry confirmation bias makes pick anything ignore science.

Also want believe it, peer reviewed yet thats call, though know choose expected. going crazy, get paid else going locked up. people testing positive, asymptomatic, mass deaths? Im trolling im legitimately curious. Im northern California everything pretty much normal besides bars closed restaurants mostly seat outdoors. people sick dying empty hospitals. Hey sorry - saw reply.


That‚Äôs awesome! Losing 25 pounds super impressive. Good job. hope keep going (if haven‚Äôt hit goal yet) hope you‚Äôre proud much progress you‚Äôve already made. That‚Äôs really really cool. Thanks updating me.


I‚Äôve actually slacking lot lately diet exercise...lost lot weight muscle put previously kind discouraged start again. reading reply knowing accomplished accomplished actually really motivating me. thank encouragement haha. Good luck everything! Why, saying anti-intellectualism isnt bigger issue south?

First important confuse intelligence anti-intellectualism thing. Anti-intellectualism disposition towards knowledge experts.

Take issue school text books. South force fundamentalist (full bullshit) textbooks children much greater numbers North? culture anti-intellectualism one explanation. alternative explanation? G variant suspected dominant strain infectious since May. re-affirming notion. basically taken selective pressure strains since others dying out. 'new' news..... church knows religious dogma thrive among ignorant anti intellectual population country. reason church cultivates ignorance anti intellectualism order maintain grow congregations thus income potential. end dollar. Apparently rise grave, right reopen schools.

:-( Every town crackpots would ping pong maybe part news letter. chat rooms, forums web pages. social media self streaming video services.

It use take effort folks link up. even laziest feed diet nonsense smug self satisfaction knowing ""the truth"" stunningly low amount work.

With added benefit self doubt obliterated see many people agreeing them.

It‚Äôs even gut, it‚Äôs propaganda.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúgut‚Äù way religious beliefs work, get indoctrinated it. Pretty sure dude meant environment many southern citizens born isn‚Äôt one education big priority. defending people south think that‚Äôs dude talking think presentations heard actual incidence flu Australia down. areas saw drop viral infections result social distancing. think effect probably dropping states less 10 active cases. live social distancing partially adhered almost one wearing mask. don‚Äôt get herd immunity 20%, no.

70%, 60% optimistic. That‚Äôs vaccine. say fake news. IDK. even pay attention school, let alone learn. College... same. Damned do

The future dark matter look now. big part it. get accident NYC? practically carry nearest hospital. get accident rural Wyoming? maybe someone come across bears do.

I'm saying education system seems little....lacking..... places. 


These people laugh wearing mask.  get laughed North. people would wearing too. Aah, nothing quite like geographical bigotry.

Face it, numbers coming down. Trend line.

Sweden---going down.

Norway---going up. CA, friend died home (in 30s) family even get autopsy let alone Covid test. even offered pay one would it. worked grocery store lot contact public. 

I'm guessing lot states reporting people dying home. happened NY. Fuck 'em.

I give shits environment US colleges created last 40 years. hope scum sucking administrators lose jobs, too. Norway's criteria ""with fewer 20 confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants last two weeks (assessed country level) average less 5% positive samples last two weeks."" case Sweden also per regional level. V√§rmland 280K people population (per wikipedia) last 14 days total 40 confirmed cases. Today quite jump, previous days really low. still fits criteria, assessment happens every two weeks. long outlier trend break, okay :S Way pedantic. ok. feel like Georgia places used guinea pigs. see bad it'll get. crossing fingers might go away. thoughts prayers policies put action. Maybe it'll go OK schools reopen make easier people go back work. Maybe ton kids grandparents die. God. Bible Belt ladies gentlemen! Literally impossible caught school. wouldn‚Äôt tested positive got there. Evidence still suggests transmission children far lower adults. Lots time Pain Killers could tell sure. seemed game stupid fucking question, attend college person? try go online... almost positive college person seating n95 dust mask use rigged valve also gets covered another filter 

Is anyway test effectiveness n95 period time? is. point day one already 1 confirmed case infected person school. Meaning happening schools. cry day.

Sweden won. Germany took gamble. gamble lost. ""You can't that"" flu season comes around, we‚Äôre gonna sorting common colds flu COVID. AKA, people going get sloppy COVID cases go unattended. 

This dumb. We‚Äôre going need shut (but actually time) it‚Äôs going get really tough. 

Would‚Äôve great leader unite us around taking precautions *not* dying but, ‚Äúit is.‚Äù makes way sense imagining. one I'm talking (as I'm sure know, following along) involved someone jabbing big qtip couple inches nostril twirling around *deep inside brain* slow count six. Lol every single person tries convey point gets ‚Äúhurr durr u want free money r lazy‚Äù

3) always transfer. 

Why dropping starting again? Also, one forcing hypothetical student attend $50,000/year institution. Plenty schools available less half cost. I'm element, can't run twice?  applies here. responsibility parents, public schools. 

Because America (was) trying set better example help kids languages succeed. responsible parents. time school reopen spread again. I'm Calgary requested test twice last month. far able get one. pharmacies testing though.  like apples? less test, less cases according Donald Trump I'm allowed say, actually. 

Cant much right though, I'm bed ridden right covid fighting urge go hospital. testing coronavirus dropping even infections remain high death toll rises 1,000 day, worrisome trend officials attribute largely Americans getting discouraged wait hours get test days weeks find results.

The lack testing resources borders criminal negligence part federal government. seen boss since March slowed us yet. Obviously virus that, still scary multiple kids may maybe wrong don‚Äôt don‚Äôt go find original story thought Rhode Island situation wanted actually deny entry state, coming today. checkpoints New York setting make sure visitors aware adhere quarantine policy, still travel out. personnel? takes ridiculous. definition eminent domain. envy guys.... fly, stuck tightest coach seats probably fine. I've theory/hope this, well. 

I guess know sure another 1-2 months go by, seems possible New York (and another hot spots) may second wave fall, least near extent did. 

I *all* discount immense benefit masks, social distancing, moron, etc, much seem there's something else play beyond areas hell come side. He's put out...what, one statement wearing mask asking others wear one? 

and thousand taking hydroxychloroquinine instead Results may vary, test get results back like 30 min. functioned similar pregnancy test lines. used blood instead urine. control line, line covid, line antibodies. Yes that's true love read somehow never find quiet peace it, days alone sound nice. since highest fine ever gotten 75‚Ç¨ ticket guess never position decide do. unscientific blabla, without sources. bothered read scientific literature would found country 10% seroprevalence.

Sorry waste time talking willingly ill-informed people, indulge wishful thinking along national lines.

Btw (weighed pop) ca. 30,000 less dead Sweden. willing close gap anytime soon. Different tests different income brackets. I‚Äôd like know symptoms child displaying, any. I‚Äôm assuming gotten tested school started due timing test results. if, say, majority young kids asymptomatic don‚Äôt spread easily, maybe elementary schools still go in-person family acknowledging child could test positive need stay away vulnerable people. teachers feel uncomfortable going, ones assist distance learning. Idk - I‚Äôm saying method right way. think it‚Äôs interesting daycares open whole time, outbreaks occurred there. ""But everybody comes contact President get tested beforehand, he's fine. that?""

--Morons, probably Joe rogans podcast Elon musk 2020(which could completely inaccurate/wrong):

Elon said lot hospitals reporting normal deaths corona deaths government compensates hospitals corona deaths nicely.

Eg: someone goes hospital critical condition due heart attack dies later without insurance. 

The hospital either gets little nothing, says corona death recieves $20,000-$50,000. 

This combined many less people going hospital they're lockdown worried they'll catch corona hospital leaves room hospitals cut corners. 

This could complete bullshit know seem plausible. Thanks!

We bought UVC CPAP cleaning machine sterilize masks (and things like phones etc) March, curious someone knows opinion something like 

The machine cycle 5 minutes Sweden 1400 cases week(twice population), Norway 290 (2 weeks). 1400 290.

When/if Norway passes Sweden post would make sense, now. I'm sorry many parents fined even threatened jail time kids missing school, even things like going 3 day vacation informed school willing homework etc. Every state enforces differently state strict. 

Your enthusiasm encouraging. chance vote election happening year???? even know state superintendent is? Lmao buddy got tested movie production Tuesday results 30 minutes. get virus control reopening every single fucking thing country like literally every country months ago? US one countries reopening schools despite still significant number outbreaks infections many areas.  need 3 month lockdown (a real one) follow wearing masks social distancing.  done would ended months ago 160k people would still alive economy would recovering.  country dumpster fire right now. ""friend"" complete dipshit. live Texas European, POV might different. used pay tons taxes get service back, Europe never needed, idea money goes sure taxpayers. 


I 100% sure opening schools going disaster keep kids online (my school district fighting absolute scum governor have) homeschooling then. already 2 million homeschooled kids US before, nobody cared isolation abused actual academic level, majority homeschooling south among religious nuts, leave alone. 

My obligation keep kids alive healthy, provide education guidance, cherry top provide extra resources. acquaintance mine symptoms kept equating sort stomach flu, plus cough (I mean, gimme break). kept telling get tested Covid quarantine herself. Stubborn is, kept going work going life usual. finally came senses, got tested and, lo behold, came back positive, everybody telling her. God knows many people infected. hardly made effort wearing mask social distance. Imagine many people like there.  Unfortunately, huge cost implications won‚Äôt happen. happens 150E you? time, old people need home health care workers still need home health care. absolutely saying people go work sick awaiting results really way controlling since people take seriously enough beginning. It‚Äôs you! It‚Äôs government. Don‚Äôt think kids yours. Children belong government government wants schools going whether like not. You‚Äôre welcome try stop great government. know stronger. I'm rich enough things ""go away"" hard?

Because month May forced parents back in-person work. Exactly taking wild guess virus burn fact-based?  Can‚Äôt speak everyone, Ontario tests become available around 1-3 days later, depending current testing backlog (usually 1 days worth tests, 3). beginning pandemic, would waiting 10-15 days result. days long gone. 



New York hit much harder Ontario, guess might explain takes long? again, NY getting results faster want contain new cases.  Fine. Lead way. would gone long way temper angst leadership AAP, Trump like-minded politicians publicly escorted children back school embrace curb day's end. know Barron Trump many children elite wealthy ""remote learning"", seem counter they're telling us ours. clear state law history this. question.

But single federal policy, there's individual constitutional rights problem state's rights issue.

I doubt ordered wear mask public spaces. Indeed, (and are) ordered wear clothes public spaces, generally speaking. different. difference generally states issue orders there's lot feds do. true. remember one case years back, judge meltdown prison treated random inmate. states much information private prisons actually reach one case really highlighted degeneracy it, perfectly. 

I managed find like trying turn hospitals source income. things expenses matter done twist someone's income, change expenses. Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuueeeeeeeeeee know proof anything, right? stop spamming now, NYC reached herd immunity. Thats like saying country learned earthquakes putting apartments 4 stories instead 10 still reinforce structures all. Like yeah, earthquake hits less people die, anyone dying know prevent minimal disruption? that's need get everyone Union strike stay committed it. name poem Tennyson. Gonna say Hoss. want know right people hurt *worse*. know? angry it. satisfied eating shit sandwich, long hear liberals bitching it. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs virtually harmless children!‚Äù

Yeah, sure. Let‚Äôs see *that* plays out. 

COVID orphans next. we‚Äôll *really* deep shit terms economy. 'We're also reporting mass child sacrifice, cannibalism, ritualistic satanic worship localized within NYC area'

'You've actually *seen* people killing eating children NYC?'

'No Tom, we're reporting it' depends state county‚Äôs availability go tests give results quickly. county better prepared resources/capabilities handle mass testing efforts filter them, turnaround quicker. county able handle I‚Äôve heard people getting results back day next day. I‚Äôve noticed lag test results get done Friday, Saturday, Sunday it‚Äôs delayed tests stack weekend. got test Saturday didn‚Äôt get results back Tuesday. area HMO testing fast. Within 2 days. 

10+ day results almost pointless. positive you‚Äôve infected dozens waiting Jesus tryna teach dumbasses something. Hello Angela thank taking time answer questions hope success research Covid-19.

I tested positive Covid-19 early July. mildly sick 3 days recovered quickly 7 days total. never experienced respiratory issues, fever, loss taste/smell, fatigue.

My question soon think could contract virus again, all? feel like lucky able get back exercising living normal life less two weeks, wondering severity sickness anything immunity response antibodies long last? worried symptoms reappearing later time, concerns reacting? Sounds Rand Paul. always ask questions unprompted answer yourself? Let guess. churches community ICU beds? dad got tested months back somebody work tested positive. got negative result back 2 days. depends area type test. really quick, slow. Maryland.  exploit sacrifice working class even before! /$ rent relief eviction anything? Secondly schools reopen, pandemic gets worse. lock again, people lose jobs get.evicted anyways, that's assuming get sick chd case medical debt probably crippling effects. Either way economic outcomes hurt one keep pandemic wraps less people die. no, good reason.  hear right wing crowd, massive floating hospital brought never used one answer. R (at least somewhat) lower (at least short term) immunity. reason New York well. Upstate WNY also well hit lot less hard. 

It's also weather keeping people outdoors, government restrictions gatherings, people voluntarily cautious avoiding crowds social distancing wearing masks saw terrible death toll nearby know happen area. Trump supporting mom dad told kids can't catch covid-19. fake news! 

They said fiance 5 month old grand daughter arms. consistently go without masks (we unfortunately got quarantined looked new apartment).  sucks feel like need cut move next week they've done nothing spout anti-science pro Trump bullshit endangering daughter, grand daughter, daily basis. first mistake even giving people option spread virus really is.  virus around almost year people learned fucking thing. surprise one Long. Term.  guide/advice much ‚Äògoing back society‚Äô allowed someone recovered virus? mild case June haven‚Äôt left house since. Would safe visit family without restrictions, 6ft+masks+outside guidance apply even young, healthy ‚Äòsurvivor‚Äô? Essentially, people recovered, still need behave yet infected? comment really reads like someone little idea they‚Äôre actually talking about, thinks sound really smart also Remdesivir live Atlanta.

There drive testing centers throughout city. move locations day day.

How quickly get answer depends lab using.

Some use lab takes 7 10 days results.

Others use lab takes 2 days.

You see lab site uses online.

I went tested last week 2 day turnaround site, get results two days (day half). Why? someone said so? Strike anyways demand change asinine rules make things like possible.

That's whole point striking first place, nothing without workers. That's labor unions got started, people treated unfairly got fed it. people risked everything change. Yet another comment edit respond. seems like lot. whole lot bad faith argument you.

The second half edit filled jargon Im even sure know talking about. while, spread notion children risk Corona. still see people say this, recent article explaining false children effective spreading virus. Myth mostly pushed children test positive tend experience exasperating symptoms, possibly due immune system producing strong response adults. Contact lawyer? Change whatever travel clothes &amp; shoes wearing enter house. leave contaminated stuff garage &amp; wash hot water later. Outside wear scarf hair &amp; take too. cover hair spritz rubbing alcohol (I wear hair less exposed). spray shoes too. 

When come home feel like I'm movie 12 Monkeys lol decontaminating go inside. take care risk mother &amp; sister I'll can. üòÇ National security issue. vaccine becomes available, take fucking recipe, give makers one time finders fee force everyone take vaccine. could allow children children adults could figure shit ourselves. Children worn torn countries responsibilities thrust them, sad terrible are.

It responsibility adults third world country allow young live lives healthy unhindered idiocies.

Pay parents fairly given fair opportunity safe put danger try win dick measuring contest. Welcome Wave 1: Part 3 I've seen lot concerns safety vaccines risk new technologies pushed trials quickly without knowing potential long term side effects. vaccine candidates look promising pick one based phase 1 safety results, would be? Exactly this. ""false starts"" end causing harm disruption. Kids go back school, jobs bring remote workers back office parent employees worry childcare. ""normalcy"" resumes restaurants, bars, movie theaters, sports, etc. kids start getting infected, worst case asymptomatics get parents sick, turn spread colleagues service workers. Hospitals overrun. Everyone scrambles schools shut down. time, overlaps flu season, holidays inevitably spreading events.

And realize mental health pandemic too. Utah, fucking moron governor decided least 15 people single school test positive order close school down.... going stop spread virus students, teachers. G614 strain understand correctly likely spread. read suggestions less lethal. good evidence back less lethal assertion?

No. G614 shown effects transmissibility pathogenicity animal model. still studied.

\-ALR Lock up. years. Attempted murder.

How dare people. Taking calculated risks health. Let‚Äôs let government risk calculations. great job taking care whole money printing thing. crap UConn football, lot easier choice them, they've pretty bad now. went 2-10 last year mostly blowout losses beat 1-11 team school lower division play. also draw much attendance sell whole lot football merchandise either. They're basketball school.

Now I'm sure due conference &amp; TV deals make money hurt financially, real one set things ""power 5"" conference school entire conference cancels/suspends season. number false positives, false negatives new 'scientific' facts Corona week one thing sure - clue. proving hard people think know everything. That's reddit lol. Yet comment saying thing +40. Meaning Among patients severe life-threatening COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy added standard treatment significantly improve time clinical improvement within 28 days, although trial terminated early may underpowered detect clinically important difference. almost read article either, thought pushing HCQ again. drug seems legit, put mass use? oh know. one thing handled well Yes, still called epidemic/pandemic. US currently near zero control spread virus. different places different things.  places even decided yet going do.  plan negotiated unions. That's probably work DOE. thoughts Russian plan start mass vaccinating population soon October? healthy me? seems gotten skin.

And wrong side history, making losing arguments subreddit, showing lack empathy, generally railing unfairness people thinking wrong stuff.

Just admit it, something want restricted doing, making mad can't it, care dies. want want want anybody hold accountable either. can't, fact, small private gatherings allowed varying sizes different states. everyone partakes understand risks inherent. [This back probably applies ever much prevalent virus Good catch. find 10 $80. exhale valve, slightly safer puts others No, lot less testing due hurricane. Percent positive still same. Europe managed keep rates Covid-19 well USA?

They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúreopen‚Äù quickly data-driven, gradual, cautious way simultaneously building robust test trace capacity building trust public health officials general public. done none above.

\-ALR Always has, always will. Fauci keeps saying schools open. caveats course, people stop listening hear ""schools open"". need someone who's actually good communicating stupid people charge pandemic response. using public schools free daycare meant still remotely valid reason nearly instantly infect thousands upon thousands people daily basis already.  going see death tolls like country experienced date unprepared are.  Forcing schools reopen soon flu season starts going kick virus overdrive going get whole hell lot worse.  People need bite bullet deal consequences keeping families safe matter option death infection dozens ways lives could ruined start taking guidance given seriously. literally life vs. death.  easy choice make.  Living hard still brainer. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs cash price... flu shots cost $40 without insurance pharmacies. isn‚Äôt completely outrageous. Virus spreading community.

Kids bring virus school.

Surprised Picachu Face thought bunch poor / minority kids would get sick die, also spreading poor / minority families. 

What seeing school boards ignorance, willfully participating genocide.  Statistics show significant correlation increased coronavirus cases BLM protests. I've seen interesting videos people live river use weighted balls chains. Would work also? is, job crisis, help anyone, it‚Äôs hard put blame individual. daft punk well idea kind immunity even conferred. could reinfect people every year like flu. talking millions americans dead, holocaust, totally avoidable. modern countries counting cases hundreds post 50k day they. wore. masks. and. actually. quarantined. really seem talk confidently things even time study yet.

Your posts ""remove elderly equation deadly"" disgusting. want hundreds thousands die completely avoidable deaths rest modern world moves on. post history reads like eugenicist. make good points, part picture. Outside expensive private universities - whose costliness part cache - tuition general continued rise alongside reduction state funding colleges universities. Virtually every state university, big marquee schools smaller regional colleges, seen proportion support get state budgets reduced eliminated last couple decades (but mostly post 2008-recession). So, schools little choice must turn recoup basic operating costs: tuition. 

Believe not, every university I've associated *hates* fact, much happier support state budget feel like bilking students. that, recognize relying tuition huge proportion costs unstable insecure. course concern pre-COVID, pandemic certainly highlights instability: short-to-medium term dips attendance devastate school budgets.

And lets forget money going schools (from tuition, case) going flashy buildings endowments. dollars going pay wages hundreds thousands staff, fancy pants tenured faculty, make small proportion workforce otherwise composed tons blue collar jobs, untenured faculty trying teach research that's love do, graduate students barely scraping measly stipends, etc. Point is, whole workforce often sizable chunk local community supported universities utterly screwed state governments must rely unstable funding sources - decisions 18 year olds. Anyway, reminder complain exorbitant tuition costs want ""stick it"" universities costs, often times people impacted everyday people trying work pay bills. excuse students forced debt pay high tuition - ultimate problem schools state governments, who've systematic defunding higher education decades. easy. We're living one income moment. like going strike guarantees anything. that, lot teachers even board mandatory masks. doubtful would join strike, without unified teachers union would absolutely replace teachers go strike. lot people south wearing mask equates weak. wife, presumed positive, 

This part people need get thick fucking skulls. I'm middle school teacher Utah Governor decided students teachers somebody HOUSEHOLD test positive still allowed come school long symptoms..... FUCKING KIDDING!?!? first paragraph state total per pupil $12,612/ year. That‚Äôs far lower private schools.


We know schools underfunded mismanaged facilities, staffed administration, etc. test results coming back fast? Good hear, wish states would figure shit out. Yes, *won‚Äôt*. doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt. many ways make better federal level. Go away racist family member get back next day Ohio Rip every kid asthma rumours going around Oxford Vaccine might already ready september. think possible all? seems virologist experts talking 2021 earliest scenario ready vaccine. think Oxford claimed september themselves, phase 3 trials usually last LOT longer time that? Good point, analysis change consider 161,000 650,000 LAUSD students English language learners whose parents may limited grasp English?

No, responsibility public schools provide non-english instruction.

For example lived Italy, public schools taught Italian. lived Germany, German. Either kids could learn effectively languages responsibility send children private English speaking school. applies here. responsibility parents, public schools. One biggest issues see substitute teachers willing go teacher gets sick. sub qualified step situation. fuck I'm subbing $120 per day medical coverage. 

This robust federal response would massively helpful. Funding sent states school districts give medical coverage substitutes, splitting large classes smaller ones, etc. 

But noooope. realize kids arent staying home social distancing right? breaking social distancing rules much adults. going friends houses. Amputate walkers Okay arguing. genuinely believe cases going nothing‚Äôs really getting better US. popped state state case map John Hopkins website seems like majority states green seeing less new cases per day? I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs Rest peace little angel want schools open working parents don‚Äôt excuse go back jobs.

This 100% I've saying (and getting weird looks response).  Government wants people back work lower unemployment rate say ""we're winning!"" get stocks climbing back up, can't kids home. 

Besides that, lot people want around kids. I'd debt dollar every time heard parent say get house kids driving crazy.

Quarantine showed us we've built entire economy around home (sports, work, recreation, entertainment). Exactly. every musician postponing tour late fall/next year 2-3 years? That's thought. make decisions affect boss, programming tells otherwise. ever hear Union?

This called strawman derail. heck get anti union, recognizing patterns means that?!

Also make union boss doesnt give shit you, agrees said.

You sidestepping point completely acting like Im pushing something didnt even talk editing previously nonsensical comment actual point view exactly problem 

In literally way continues proven incubate propagate idea right home would assume well.

You made ridiculous strawman anti union something trying make argument Im propagating strawman.

What random arguments sake even cant wrap mind around bigger picture, said subject pandemic prime example sub meta.

I dont think even know sentence means. Yes, course. Plus various states reporting issues case counts now. pregnant twins cousin went vacation florida beach, despite fact already complications twins, risk prematurely giving birth. Absolute insanity, repeatedly posts facebook asking prayers unborn children growth complications, puts pregnancy harms way intentionally? Thankfully get sick. agree this, might lower tuition - make bank selling overpriced housing food. Um... no. good start. Kinda like voting every single Republican. good start.  former elementary school high school news last two days. Jeez. directly White House... mean, go route, company person interviews? offer option accommodate candidates? making clear candidates requesting zoom interview hurt chances offer? person stupid, again, desperate job job crisis, hard hold them. 

Still stupid honest though. pretend trickle-down economics works abortion restrictions really saving babies controlling women, pretend plague not. reason get test really anywhere home. sucked atmosphere hurricane tested coronavirus count Covid19-related death? anyone might know, would reusable used UVC instead methods like autoclave? like magic stick-and-go-back-to-restaurants-and concerts, doubt we'd get anything magic like that.

Hello Chicago! Someone call Uncle Junior, think makings varsity athlete. Many industries adapting social distancing. I‚Äôm sure industries you‚Äôre thinking here. 

For example, work factory work lines build product. spaced work stations, isn‚Äôt possible, added plastic sheeting stations. 

Lunch breaks staggered prevent many people space. even offered allow people change shift times bit spread little more. 

Restaurants near might bit wait time - they‚Äôre making take orders. 

Stores limit number people one time. Marks outside social distancing there‚Äôs line. Require masks etc. 

Basically, social distancing end world. It‚Äôs adapting current climate world around us. 

Industries fully able adapt. wear mask 10 hours work honestly don‚Äôt even notice more. found mask comfortable me. feel safe everyone else also wearing masks. what's point wanting vaccine? guessing.

Canadian here: understanding, many municipalities require masks public spaces (at least Ontario, vast majority people live). Beyond that, offices live changed policies allow distancing (WFH option, flexible meeting arrangements). honestly big deal all. pretty much shifted is. want gatherings need follow guidelines responsible. perfect, nothing is. 

 Everyone pops mask go store. really issue, seem ""incredibly massive"" either. economy still working distancing policy work save lives. Businesses open, technology communication friends. weird unusual. Back basics really-support local farmers shops, respect neighbours listen professionals. actually quite well would phase case continue things settle.

Want proof model work US? Look south, forced shutdown bars gave local govt authority mandate masks, many did.

It bad. county NY indoor dining bars restaurants, still curb stomping virus. done differently states? mask hell up, governor put strict regulations place regarding bars enforces harsh penalties guidelines broken. seems response US needs.

Me, I‚Äôd love erected barricade around property supplied food/water/bedding/basic med supplies caught recovered died wouldn‚Äôt able spread anyone else.

Triaging medical care necessary demand outstrips supply. Pandemics high demand situation medical care.

Maybe Georgia think Indiana school close first day. yes general sentiment saying true. Yes, intuition 100% correct. 

For test like nasal swab/qPCR, miss ~30% true positives test once. test daily, odds true positives testing negative N days (0.30)^n . So, 30% first day, 9% two days, 3% three days, etc. Here, test becomes reliable repeated trials.

COVID tests mostly assessed ‚Äúgood‚Äù based sensitivity (how viral particles detectable). Sensitivity important (especially detecting non-infectious patients). need assessed speed, price, ease use, people get tested, get results daily. Sounds like allergies colleges trying force campus. tuition costs insane begin with, can‚Äôt justify online only. Maybe spark change never ending tuition inflation problem.

I'm convinced enclosed spaces without air movement exchange need avoid. virus evolved bats caves airborne transmission makes sense. Heh, America bad.. .... kids wearing masks school could stopped large percentage that. Let fucking try it.  People fed bullshit likely tolerate much it.  work elected officials work us high time reminded role country is. that? 14-21 day nationwide quarantine? 

I‚Äôd good either things. Mask distance mandates don‚Äôt work. Unenforceable practical sense. NHL, too. No. study New York covid deaths said numbers least 50% higher reported, possibly 100% higher.

So reported figure 150k looking 225-300k deaths least.

And given southern states actively fiddling figures, could worse still. Let guess sample size n = 100. read article. enforcement I'm referring like something witnessed day supermarket/plaza area. police appeared maybe lunch standing awning. person person person person person walking without masks stood shopping cart watched officers say nothing them.  little city one Class C Misdemeanor thing wear mask. sound upset

So sorry loss. Remember fauci scolded saying could see 100 200k deaths? wont bad. we're 150k. Todays numbers preview, real numbers published late august. value job homeless. Florida gone days 15,000 5,000? Florida lying numbers, guarantee it. Put handbook hope future administration doesn‚Äôt dismantle pandemic response team exists specifically prevent pandemic quite devastating. reality made cynical fact real motivation behind response 9/11 reaction offense capitalism rather human life. Aren‚Äôt infections surfaces almost zero? Correct I‚Äôm wrong  Omg, 'science'!? statistics!? Well, hot dam, guess win. Plus U.S. population 'so fucking stupid?' really making use 'Gen X arguing guide'. Well done. Dark thought, able easily quarantine indefinitely, including stable job. afford huge schooling nanny kids home school issue either.

I extreme privilege world describe allow gain more. kids going leap peers can't home educate, probably ones going school well.

It's pretty fucked. year I'll able afford house. Exactly. believe understands important social interaction peers children wants back school long safety precautions taken. Well yeah like 75% opponents already canceled games scheduled them. believe US figure annualized, whereas Swedish figure quarter. Using equation 

r(ann) = (1+r(quar))^(4)-1

we would get Swedish annualized rate would -30.2%, American quarterly rate would -9.49% (based reported -32.9% annualized rate).  Emergency use always going happen phase 3 trials completely finished- following participants 2 years cases. need know immunity starts waning.

What looking efficiency. actually timeline done depends critical number- many people get sick. take number sick compare vaccinated group placebo group. That's phase clear emergency use.

Moderna scheduled major assessment 3 months vaccination starts phase 3 regardless. date October 27. even sooner, phase 3 got delayed logistical issues. Pfizer likely similar plans. Oxford already phase 3 trials elsewhere starting US arm, likely data sooner. timelines beginning changed. Anti-abortion activists get angry woman aborting fetus would killed continued (ectopic pregnancy) don‚Äôt yell woman stillbirth (also unavoidable termination pregnancy). Neither choice, pretend one is. people seriously think less people going get infected 50k cases day? magically spread further? Expect rise regardless ""testing"" shows. Use common sense. going school anyway? summer vacation? Southwest employees.....r/tellthetruth National average wait seven days currently. (More two days makes contact tracing useless) It‚Äôs even flu season. People still compare flu swine flu whatever. Wait till fall winter . good job this. Must nice. Imagine Obama said something like 150,000 dead Americans.... I‚Äôm vaccinated two weeks don‚Äôt give fuck getting that‚Äôs problem. university utilities make 5% expenditures, custodial staff roughly 2% that. Cutting saves $4,000,000; $800 savings student. Weird institutions getting pass yesterday arguing sending kids school idiocy politicians advocating guilty attempted murder. well received. expected, take long obvious result play out. Ahh good job America, let‚Äôs make sure get next 24 hours rest world really knows much fucking joke example study SARS, severe virus, hospitalised cases recovered lung function 2 years: interstitial damage functional decline caused SARS mostly recovered, greater extent recovery within 2 years rehabilitation"" everyone options here.  People choose make pandemic worse.  People choose expose kids virus. People choose expose teachers virus.  People choose infecting coworkers.

Again 155k dead 5 million infections soon 6.  stop matter cost inconvenience. parasites? Yes supposed watered spraying it. evaporate 24-48 hours. Sadly, good portion America believes American always wipe everything clorox every flight spill boiling water everything room get hotel. actually does. track nearly closely COVID year. honestly think first coronavirus body count, you? ""extremely rare"" yes, main mode transmission. Thanks! get now. Also one worst affected first wave. contact tracing efforts providing free testing costs money. 7 deaths 38,000 confirmed cases children

0.018% Damn, went ukraine norway got tested second day ukraine, option quarantine 7 days get test negative. 

Well mine positive contacted everyone near contact last weeks doctor chief doctor communal area contacted start tracing.

 Pretty sure got house warming party 20 people, could shop know. 

Scary though, symptoms mild, hadnt test get quarantine would never thought covid 19, took another test today sure, yeah hopefully stays mild üôè

Atleast recover dont quarantine get back home üòÖ

And wondering flied ukraine now, well girlfriend seen hoping good time it. Done best travel avoid infecting others mask hand sanitizer etc.

In isolation course, hope dont infect girlfriend chances big that. School endowments private donations. Usually, dividends/returns used pay scholarship (so received scholarship someone's name it) families businesses set up.

So larger grows internal scholarships offer. Unfortunately, even vaccine arrives, likely suppress completely eradicate virus... Wear masks, keep hand sanitizer you, maybe dissolving soap sheets, baggie pack clorox wipes. That's flying. Yep, that's wrote work long period time you‚Äôre delusional I‚Äôd think will. year two. they‚Äôd go broke. Food workers, really anyone go outside see people daily job think would cut spread lot. Well consider nearly 2 months zero local transmissions. suggests possibility mutation always people coming testing positive. Also consider HK handful hospitals admit Covid patients. precarious position. Fair enough. good day ! affects year two, worth it? Absolutely not.

Where say that? It‚Äôs law; we‚Äôre mandated wear inside province think stores get fines customer inside &amp; wearing mask, stores really clear strict rules Sadly, trumpers disagree love liberal tears

R e p r e Small things going change. hand washing, maybe wearing mask feel sick go public, things like that. there's absolutely way social distancing large group gatherings like sporting events going last forever. ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù. I'm lucky enough live part Germany less affected, still makes angry see people wearing masks correctly, all.

Last week went next city train saw early twenties girl unashamedly wearing mask able eat shitty McDonald's, put mask saw controler heading way, covering mouth. took damn thing off, God fucking forbid wear anything would make feel even little bit inconvinienced. 

I hope first strike huge fines implemented everywhere, transgressors get determined video well. problem vaccines inherently political. work well public trust physical characteristics. means people high-profile appointments generally feel need bite tongue skepticism may arise fear spreading skepticism.

The problem experts charge track record telling like is, fear expressing doubt result wrong behavior. One authority even said recommending masks finally ‚Äúwe knew would help long time didn‚Äôt want tell didn‚Äôt want using substitute social distancing‚Äù 

We need educated, manipulated. culture among public health political leaders tends towards telling people info believe result behavior believe best bet, holding back info feel result wrong behavior. don‚Äôt trust public make informed decisions, turn means skeptics, need, turn don‚Äôt trust authorities. It‚Äôs shame. countries authorities aren‚Äôt afraid tell is. flu kill 160k 4 1/2 months superintendent seems okay this. 

The world upside down. throwing things comparable... way, still exist. wear socks?

Will wear jackets cold?

Will wear toques?

Will wear gloves? 

You get used it. big deal one seems care complain here. 

Getting Covid onerous, wearing mask prevent sure hell not. Experts say kind sanitizing essentially worthless. It‚Äôs theater. There‚Äôs minimal risk fomite transmission. kid, consensus ""hey kid chickenpox - go get chickenpox get with"".

Now adults, many us painful sometimes debilitating shingles outbreaks. know one person blinded one eye broke along optic nerve. Many us getting vaccinated it.

People never learn. indeed scary, still soich beknown long-term effects. Post-vieal fatigue common viruses. yet clear permanent condition clears tims. agree thrown around lightly, extreme case... warranted here. headlines like Swedes rapidly losing trust Covid-19 strategy, poll finds... Yeah definitely happen. think case majority elderly dying! /s

I think Trump doesn‚Äôt care knows reason economy staying afloat the‚ÄùDeath Tax‚Äù. It‚Äôs thing contributing 2 TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT American people. Retired elderly people money nothing time spend money taking long government get hands cash. in, tourists Alberta? tourists visiting Alberta?

And they‚Äôre wearing masks inside? outside? No, everything thought virus wrong, reality worse. 70% heart damage, vaccines going offer lasting protection. expensive fly, put concert open new restaurant. living good ever get, get worse money runs out. never see orchestra live, eat restaurant, go festival beach, visit museum go date without massive medical assurances.

Yes, old days, would recovered letting burn population, shooting total elimination normal life restart, obvious virus permanent. Teachers government never go back normal unless complete elimination, never happen. know exactly details, get test proof traveling almost missed flight delay. ü•Ç wonder fast they're recovering. US ranks worst developed countries world. Stop comparing bad worst. need take measures get thing control functioning society. want behave like developing countries response virus, need accept society going function like developed country can't deliver quality education every child. can‚Äôt liquidate endowment like lump sum cash though. top schools like this. They‚Äôre necessarily greedy. wealthier graduates donate more. wild many levels administration completely abdicate responsibility use require masks, sole reason level recommends require them. No, public health officials living lala land need reminded live reality Dropping off, indeed Welcome new normal, guess.

US track hit 5 million cases week. 13 days ago hit 4 million. 

Almost seems like question is, hit 6 million September? Selfish idiot? think helps screening people airport/train station too. Ah! Thanks. make difference? IDK state level politicians encouraged colleges universities ""run like business"" cutting away state dollars go higher education. Places like UVA, example, gotten nearly 10 billion dollars, refer state-supported institution. while, real fear higher education states cutting away higher ed (at least four years) almost entirely. 

When Mark Warner governor Virginia, asked every higher ed institution give proposals 3, 5, 7 percent cut (although may 5, 7, 10). UVA sent letter telling governor voluntarily cut 5. proceeded tell send along proposals 3, 5, 7 percent cut, think cut another 5 percent. many 9/11's Americans committed people pandemic far?  going charge extra risk... expect number best indicator dangerous Covid schools really is. Insurance companies casinos best assessing risk. Plus testing taking long, symptom overlap, person ultimately tests negative COVID might infection antibiotics would help; waiting 5-14 days (or more) treat might judged worse unnecessary antibiotics, plus, like said, risk secondary infections.

A lot people also phone visits, doctor might less likely take cultures. HMO completely different workflows, locations, scheduling general labs COVID-specific testing. working hard avoid people come unnecessary tests, etc. discouraging in-person appointments unless absolutely necessary. Reddit win quick information! known months children spread covid19.  hardly breaking news.  demanding schools reopen safe gets people back work.  Data nothing whatsoever this. 38,000 confirmed cases children 7 deaths, take awfully long time die. here. opened bars indoor dining. Yeah quickly remembered reaction SARS started hearing covid (‚ÄúSARS-like virus‚Äù back then). kid SARS hit, even though weren‚Äôt many cases Canada, everyone - even kids - respecting health measures put place. quick tests heard US lousy 50% accuracy, terrible, specially since false negative ones false positive much less dangerous. flaw thinking. I'm simply person enjoys good discussion possibilities. Unfortunately instead intelligent debate tend get people write negative comments use OPINION match opions echo chambers. People inquisitive minds look possible theories personal attack opinion another interesting thought consider. post told I'm right post actually want ppl knowledge explain can't help alleviate fears worse case scenario. flew June. already didn‚Äôt trust every single time someone cleaning seats tray tables. wipes also 3oz bottle hand sanitizer liquid form trick made feel better. Honestly‚Äîwe wiping least tray tables seat belt buckles way Covid, cause EW. Lol That's need get everyone page short, hard lock like China did. 
Put infected suspected people quarantine 2 months later virus gone business continue economy recover.

It's way avoid long term economic damage (not mention millions dead) seems almost country willing bite bullet... Don‚Äôt fly. systemic racism methodology. ""Only elderly already sick people die rona"" - everyone know direct sunlight like 10 minutes kills virus, put N95 sun ten minute wear again, no?

And talk 'direct sunlight' means can't e.g. put car hit sunlight there's glass between? wondering: school would decide close positive test results students, open all? think they‚Äôd miraculously make even couple weeks? I‚Äôm sarcastic, honestly wonder thought process is. didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd last couple days, open? 

On hand, stay open whatever percentage kids stays home, like would flu, people going blame outbreaks community. can‚Äôt win. one win. We‚Äôre losing. really care now. Surface contact transmission myth proof. airborne transmission, thats like see something about. ""two teenagers, along five minors ranging 9 17 years old""

It's equally misleading say ""children"" talking 17 year olds

And context, article also says ""More 38,000 minors Florida infected coronavirus"", means 7 deaths rate 0.018% Take. Care. Of. Yourself. 

Stop expecting others take care you. Delta handing purell wipes board, snack/water bags hand gel hand sanitizer inside. mods ban guy already, he's clearly trolling every post sub, adding nothing valuable discuss southwest, believe don‚Äôt enforce masks didn‚Äôt enforce masks. agree. get fine. Don‚Äôt angry. one purpose Agree! It‚Äôs strange read people protesting masks USA it‚Äôs politicized issue Toronto. We‚Äôre Stage 3 reopening. Masks way safely get point economy open without spiking infections. Imagine effect socially disconnecting children years learning socially connect.

This whole lockdown much destructive virus. asked introducing cheaper, paper-based tests, government‚Äôs ‚Äútesting czar,‚Äù Adm. Brett Giroir, warned accuracy could fall low 20% ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think would service American public something wrong seven 10 times,‚Äù Giroir said last week. ‚ÄúI think could catastrophic.‚Äù

NOOOOO misses whole point paper-based tests! They're *randomly* inaccurate, they're inaccurate detecting *lower* virus thresholds molecular tests. *But lower levels, infectious*. They're totally accurate detecting higher levels. whole point quickly identify people infectious, slowly identify days later. [RAPID TESTING Brown gal here. I'm floored backlash brown people zero attachment international events face vs non-maskers may play part someone falling ill, accrued medical expenses, even loss life. Twitter users need start trying convince approval ratings popularity would waaaaaaaay higher return Celebrity Apprentice instead staying office. No, really well known soap washes viruses hand. Doesnt inactivate them. Republicans Imagine living world free thinkers ‚Äúwe‚Äù mean ‚Äúthe entire global population 6+ billion people‚Äù, ‚Äúdone right‚Äù mean ‚Äúlimit nearly 100% social interactions nearly 100% compliance‚Äù, ‚Äúlasted months‚Äù mean ‚Äúreduced spread virus months re-emerged untracked unknown reservoir, putting us right back position‚Äù, completely agree. Maybe testing less people symptoms/are exposed. that‚Äôs good thing. No. What's amazing people hear 150,000 people died, many deaths could prevented, say ""it is"". Yea, really simple That's expensive. recycle Australia. would cheaper govt pay everyone get vaccinated long run never admit that. went walk testing centre, took thirty minutes. results four hours later.

I live Canada though. Considering actions (or lack thereof) caused 160,000+ dead Americans, matter you.

And yes, treated like hoax people dead. Same. It‚Äôs frustrating knowing people church even taking precautions, definitely attend person. ‚ÄúTrust God‚Äù answer. 15,000 people dead... assuming every single person 18 gets covid, though? is? size fire? one state still hay bale whereas another halfway across field? think mean Greed. true. still discuss guns white guy shoots someone. closer get 2 million dead (assuming 1% death rate), faster get back normal!

Except dead people, course give maybe week... less. Lmfao soooo wanted open get positive take two weeks off? Nobody's going pretty soon. inevitable exposure degree across board worry us.

We know !-) people need job support family, need send kids school work, high risk teachers staff. 

they don‚Äôt choice, really get that?  1-2 weeks. could early July 11th, could late July 18th. also assumes got sick 4th (Saturday) 5th (Sunday, still partying) 6th (Monday, many people still had/took off). could even late July 20th showing symptoms.

The point is, people see July 4th, full-blown outbreak week later, say ""See, reason even quarantine!"" You‚Äôre right Cuomo. apologies Hi u/usefulcovidiot meaningless nothing exaggeration hysterics part media. clickbait. post headlines draw readers think hospitals must capacity that's reality. 

The truth still plenty capacity NONE predictions ""overwhelmed"" come true. Show instance someone heart attack needed ICU died get access one full COVID patients. still happened despite people predicting exact thing weeks, months now. meant maskless touche Lmao right Haha yes upvote. Even opened back don‚Äôt want part society anymore.

If Trump wins November, consider America over. thought first 4 years bad 2nd half going absolutely insane. Agree, things slowly improving, still ways go. people seem want worst case doomsday scenario, want virus go away hopefully, vaccines work. close schools 1000 cases open 4.5 million cases? despite lobbyists reps *do* fear voted out. spending, even irrational spending, comes consent.

I really think that's case. Congress notoriously bad approval rating extremely high incumbency yield. words, people hate Congress people vote prevented voting.

Upsets rare seems like parties actively gatekeep type politicians get elected lose fairly high degree. happens primaries really designed minimize turnout certain types voters.

Politicians afraid voters. They're afraid donors. mask policy evolution great example. McConnell give flying fuck masks donors started losing money due uncontrolled spread. matter many people pushed support masks, refused businesses cared. he's pushing immunity legislation protect protect donors. worrying Governor's Murphy Cuomo Lamont might need take look prevent something like happening states. **Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks six feet apart providing adequate ventilation, say, likely crucial vaccine available.**

Or trust actual medical experts say virus transmitted surfaces, shut fuck spreading misinformation?

I'm glad brought 9/11 correct analogy. Right 9/11 also induced hysteria told bearded muslim terrorist hiding beds closets. That's shoved patriot act iraq war throats.  There's good chance virus might spread via AC.

If per room OK. look trends shown charts. new york new jersey hubs international travel. course cases going spike *without federal intervention*. especially true given population densities areas coronavirus introduced. learned virus, states like new york new jersey moved enact policies would reduce spread (i.e., number cases). that's reflected data.

as virus spreads rural areas, local state governments enforce policies protect people... look like that's happening based current trends. Yeah people like killing us holding us back. Also ones making America hit hard. game Lifeboat I'd put out.

Trump seriously said interviewer, ""You can't that"" reference citing Per Capita statistics.

I sarcastic comment said ""You can't that."" personally anything per capita statistics. stats think appropriateness depends specifically trying compare measure. seems appropriate context me.

I intended use Trumps words sarcastically also felt interviewer using per capita statistics appropriately attempting demonstrate relative level ridiculousness Presidents words here.

I apologize lack clarity mean detract original comment. fact checked comment responded accuracy seems like something seriously worth keeping mind consider various parts United States impacted COVID 19.

Thank requesting clarification. think raise good point attempt make light situation may legitimizing de-legitimizing information thread focused providing information people time difficult find good information.

Thanks maintaining accountability. try better future. Actually, virus continuing General Sherman's good work.

Let‚Äôs excoriate people outside trying manage terrible situation socially interacting 

Just people feel validated home bound isolated lifestyles doesn‚Äôt mean everyone live way America: country idiots, idiots, idiots. pandemic end virus eradicated. bad population fares during, dependent actions political leaders, end. mostly based vaccine development. So, asking many die, restrictions lifted, travel refund etc. Sure say political, simply asking think pandemic could end, really like asking someone storm think rain might stop. verified case covid almost definitely means transmission days prior, longer.

I said, ""Sure, problem - for? already working home.""

She replied, ""now parks open again, I'm taking family Disney."" (which included 70 year old mother).

disgusting. people sub believe done proper shutdown back March true ""quarantining"" period would lasted 1 month six weeks tops virus would reduced enough allow specialized methods control like fully adopted masking, travel bans, detailed contract tracing, light limitations unessential businesses, effectively allowing us reopen 90%.

Most people sub think 1 month 99% lockdown cost economy general public WAY less money year+ half assed lockdowns. Problem America probably always short sighted. Business look fiscal quarters instead 5 years now. People say repeated record daily infection counts bad deaths going [yet].

They say yet, even mean incapable extrapolating dataset. cases today means reported deaths 3-4 weeks.

Sorry tell agree there, big points. take lumps, shut real time, compliance get shorter less hurts.

But reason can't real shutdown people get bored, that's fucking pathetic. Population density, number international travelers. NY NJ 2 densest metropolitans entire country.

FTFY smart people would making lot money become...rich? New York too. Upstate NY conservative. think pretty sad handle data professionally yet can't understand noisy data affects data, data reflects higher numbers. Interesting thought strongly suspect average stress levels much higher among pandemic. Record unemployment, anxieties virus itself, etc. ‚Äú Amy Scott always said wanted teach high school day died. coronavirus appeared‚Äù

She died coronavirus appeared? Population density. think you‚Äôre posting speculation fact matter serious Covid people made aware you‚Äôre talking hole. ask metric they're going of. thing would label California ""worse"" number cases, that's population difference.

Going current CDC numbers:

Cases per 100,000

CA: 1,302

FL: 2,284

Deaths per 100,000

CA: 24

FL: 34 south.... literally everywhere except maybe vermont. That‚Äôs problem though. plenty countries masks aren‚Äôt required streets yet USA it‚Äôs talk yet even guys wearing masks America bad COVID. That‚Äôs people think masks don‚Äôt work aren‚Äôt problem. Social distance people going work even though aren‚Äôt feeling great. 

I personally think masks don‚Äôt help outdoor places people wear masks places like theaters crowded/badly ventilated places. 

So yeah that‚Äôs think can‚Äôt force masks people public. Ofcourse every country handles things different nothing said right answer always. France, Italy, Spain New Zealand went strict lock downs. NZ early never suffered many deaths. France, Italy Spain late, still contained outbreak last weeks, due carelessness countries reopening tourism aggressively. US quite alone rich world present, countries like Mexico, Brazil, Peru, India company, also failing make much progress controlling outbreaks. quebecer always found funny Alberta Quebec pretty conservative, hate eachother much see argument could done conservative party would work both.

And thats there's Conservatives english, Bloc french.

But really conservatism Alberta quebec thing. Canada weird mix heavily conservatives areas (mostly rural) heavily liberal areas (mostly big cities).

Living south shore Montreal really see that. Basically every town see mostly goes Montreal work liberal, go, people go big city work becomes conservative. IMO people take obvious humor face value bigger problems humor. one thing parrot something amused another take serious. context clearly serious.

Let idiots fry amongst themselves. president puts ""Just wait, I'll right eventually"" Exactly. That‚Äôs perfect analogy. almost sound like hope happens. (as well Alberta Quebec, deeply conservative provinces)

Ummm what? Quebec socially conservative comes culture language, progressive literally every metric. know, think people less ignorant resentful expertise education they've ever been.

Vienna (APA) - Already beginning July Viennese vaccinologists virologists MedUni Vienna reported apparently half infected SARS-CoV-2 developed protective immune response. laboratory test developed second study group MedUni Vienna showed protective rate 60 percent. Furthermore, antibodies could even ""promote"" Covid-19 pathogens.

In addition, team scientists also discovered previously unknown fact: certain immune complexes consisting RBD antibodies patients increased binding rate ACE2. would previously unknown mechanism enables virus dock easily body cells.

It‚Äôs almost like people realizing phrase ‚Äúgood enough government work‚Äù compliment praise work done, met high standards government. 

Then Reagan GOP came through.

Now good enough government work said snicker, indicating something done half-assed. 

Make government fucking huge again, tax living shit 7 figure gains.  Yeah, friend get paid, average person die kill anyone else. great loss, like industry collapse. two separate statistics COVID-19 deaths (there bit information listed post links recent updated data : 

One - one reported daily since start March FHM (Public Health Authority) based methodology reporting deaths flu epidemics - provides faster reporting may ommit patients confirmed test include others sick died unrelated causes. criteria included tested positive COVID-19 within 30 days death. Since wide community spread found start March since mid-March end-May patients severe symptoms hospital care staff prioritized testing. also includes patients nursing homes, necessarily patients hospitals. reports deaths reported upward administration chain way national authority addition, authority makes cross-check death register positive-tests register week (usually results higher number deaths Wednesday perform check Tuesday afternoon).

The second statistic - one reported Board Health Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) one based actual death certificates doctors. one takes longer compile since law requirement get death certificate within 3 weeks death, simple death notice FHM cross-checks supposed reported within working days (but contains information causes death). death certificates include people tested COVID, also include people diagnosed COVID-19 doctors tested, however numbers also exclude people positive time death deaths different causes unrelated disease complications. 

On figure see two numbers compared per day death: ; Socialstyrelsen numbers started reported updated weekly end April. found people missed FHM statistics, since start May actually FHM over-reports compared Socialstyrelsen. statistic Socialstyrelsen one officially included official deaths statistics end year (since one based full death certificates information) add 90% people count COVID-19 deaths also found FHM reports. numbers currently ""5527 COVID-19 deaths occurred 1/3 18/7"" Socialstyrelsen report 5696 deaths reported period FHM recent update yesterday.

In addition, lot newspapers also look excess deaths (based causes compared previous years baseline) period see overestimations deaths - currently Statistics Sweden estimates 5054 deaths period 1/3 18/7 excess mortality compared 2015-2019. unlike countries (NL, UK, Spain, US many others) excess deaths show might under-reporting, Sweden three independent deaths statistics seem agreeing other. people didn‚Äôt give up. never gave shit begin with.

The people saw people continued post Facebook since beginning asking repeatedly bars/restaurants/gyms/etc reopen. [insert kid related function] resume.

They never tried. never cared. virus started spreading since December last year. 

It seriously affected people since March countries shut down. we‚Äôre 5 months widespread COVID 

We much longer 5 months go. ends people caught vaccinated. won‚Äôt happen year, likely longer.

We‚Äôre probably 1/3rd way earliest still fizz, even nobody buys it. Reality objective, subjective. going like ostrich bury head (in societal-isolation hole).

There also less-good futures. vaccine requires frequent doses means need much production capacity make work, drags grey period. also mean people non-compliant dosing schedule ordinary human error, makes less effective population whole.

By May 20, U.S. states begun lifting stay-at-home orders restrictions put place curb spread novel coronavirus. day-to-day increase country's cases hovered around 20,000 couple weeks shooting back crossing 70,000 first time mid-July.

Many states seen rise infections recent weeks, -- including Arizona, California Florida -- reporting daily records.

However, new data suggests national surge cases could leveling off, according internal memo Federal Emergency Management Agency obtained ABC News Tuesday night. seven states territories upward trajectory new cases, 10 states plateau 39 states going down, according memo.

Nationwide, last week saw 9.2% decrease cases previous 7-day period. also 7% increase new deaths compared previous week, figure lower 20-30% week-over-week increase country seen late, according memo. Even though dip ocean make wet, rain also make wet.

Miami International Airport third U.S. terms international arrivals. I‚Äôm loop, Sat-Mon generally lower, plus FL (and states?) fully reported last days, esp respect tropical storm etc. kidding ya rascals north wall health officials say masks unnecessary? Even week one friends confidently explained it‚Äôs worse flu... Yeah sucks there's like 5 deaths 5 due Covid 155,000 that's like like 0.00003% chance? math may üò± statement stands, keep super secret upvotes. ""The spread Covid-19 South shows effect natural selection"" Yeah promote article disparaging entire swath population, that's civil. sub cancer. fun assholes. Hey friend! 

I run FOH broadway tours. would closed tour yesterday Atlanta starting next one September. Stay strong there, hope well...all things considered. headline misleading. Soap effective. Thank you. guy here, concerned mortality rates seen ventilator patients high 80%s. patients put course worst would likely 100% without them. 
 
 Also, small number machines, could (hypothetically) lose 20 trauma patients waited one COVID patient recover. know hospital system work for, speak, first full recovery result using machine, far experience goes read corporate emails help people get computers programs working.

America much west quickly devolving failed states Yeah Google easy find like driving truck

Auburn sucks  New Zealand following SCIENCE deadly VIRUS anymore... what‚Äôs difficult understand COVID deniers?? doubt it. People fake science throughout history. Scientific racism. Religion-based science. Lobotomies. UFO's. Health supplements. Pretty much conspiracy theory purports show truth authorities (including scientists) hiding.

What ultimately happens part human nature. people rigorous scientists and, agenda, whether actual goal entertainment, defer another authority tells things they'd prefer true stick it. Yeah San Clemente ain't hot either aware Disney World Government agency? leave home medical appointments. Cancer pandemic scary. kids able hear anything said, especially 8 hours instruction. Clock ticking insurance companies getting involved. require 10s 100s thousands dollars medical care Covid insurer see social media posts basically caught purpose, use cover you, we'll races states practicing restrictions social distancing?

EDIT: see rather downvote worldview challenged. :) Get spray pump bottle used gardening mix 1:10 Clorox solution. same. problem wearing mask could limit spread illnesses generally could save us ton money societal level.  Nah hotty toddy 300,000 car? I'd rather use money hold next couple years. reading comments, holy fuck billionaires done good job making americans hate other, rich fuckers running show Religion general middle finger science reasoning, shocker there. surprise many ppl replied mixing theology religion... seems like dumb twats side fence, again, shocker. many workers Portland come Washington side. theoretically closed bridges, work plenty companies get railroaded. OTCMKTS: RLFTF Various studies given different results. high school open US today. None students used masks social distanced. see works out. Probably well. Kids get sick, worry adults kids inevitably get sick.  dink stand for? Pretty poor way look data.

It clear South hit plateau clear why. case numbers finally got point people began self-impose lockdowns distancing. easing number cases, also round 2 nailing economy. aren‚Äôt plateauing over.

At time clear states early part curve south May (like Ohio). They‚Äôll follow trajectory people take seriously economy suffer again.

So nation get rolling outbreaks economic damage round round. Like knew beginning this, come far worse terrible approach.

We need national single plan standard find balance get this. Lots businesses survived first lockdown Spring. way harder second lockdown happening voluntarily aid. God knows happen comes around fall/winter. Yea there's reason need use spunbound polypropylene besides absorption. kinds disposable wipes hold solutions (make wipes, armour wipes, alcohol swabs, wet naps, gym wipes, tub-o-towels). power ramp up, they're sure long pandemic last want invest another production line demand dwindle winter. experiences it? I've trying find official source days there's almost nothing online :( Really reinforces idea American ""journalism"" straight propaganda. think journalists question even allowed push back aggressively like that, want paycheck. I'm Mississippi living Japan. comes clear education messaging. would say Japanese government anything right, start clear people wash hands wear masks. Every day, everywhere message news signs loud speakers since February. force anything clear smart thing wear mask wash hands.

On calls friends colleagues Mississippi (who super smart business leaders) almost afraid mention wearing mask good thing stigmatized. messaging media government US place (especially CDC saying wear masks begining) friends confused truth regarding Coronavirus deal it. 

I'm glad finally, finally making right decisions definitely seen mindset changed last weeks. America likelihood already surpassed 200K deaths. Many old people died home undiagnosed. article 5 years old relate covid19? something ""fucking moron"" thing sure link sources anymore, make shit up! last 4 years? Majority. mid thirties mindset minority evidenced cursory look online forum got hard Corona parents love you. So, file ‚ÄúNo Shit‚Äù or... 1918? everyone die flu? too... people really terrible making right choices public health. Theres reason need borderline totalitarian restrictions, people don‚Äôt know self enforce, sadly. Keeping ignorance alive! culture obedience authority apart American society.

That utter bullshit. Conservatives would *love* live within authoritarian society - long it‚Äôs authority protects doesn‚Äôt bind in-group (them) simultaneously binds protect out-group (everyone else). would like live safer world, take relief action done. would need stay home everyone US taking proper precarious seriously, like first world countries. would like open back up.  United States pay classroom supplies pocket? Ha, delusion got there.

Oh mean like mechanic's buying tools? HVAC workers buying tools? Like workers buying tools?

What bunch whiney babies, perpetually complaining things literally every salaried worker do. Yeah get coffee window without ever able enter establishment. bars around outdoor seating only.

Cool. Day cares open day care workers heroes. Teachers privileged whiners care anyone themselves. compete salons, restaurants, theaters PPE.

This yet another many reasons sheltering place default behavior things control. Ok? I. change opinion wrong.  like part tested assume worst self quarantine assumed? skipped that..why Well 98 percent chance dying. many. Like less 10% inmates private prisons. Reddit convinced number 1 thing needs fixed prison reform though.  Ludvigsson seem always downplay severity disease. 
I sure good idea keep schools open. knows long term effects even children get infected? love people like ""underlying medical condition? COUNT"". Like F you! son asthma deserves die? considered government makes choices schooling mandatory masks? many children adults seniors underlying medical conditions may shorten lifespan, catching covid mean death sentence. Wow, thats really tough :( But, sounds like things getting better thankfully still somewhat young. 

Parenting truly difficult thing especially trying balance needs, theirs, sometimes parents too.

Also similar you, faced verbal physical abuse kid teen years (e.g., mom held knife throat treated kill father leave). So, find super hard discipline a... traditional way? (I experience hard know normal there). 

That's also partly think find easy patient, go back badly treated want anything remotely like kids, probably fault. habit making time convincing everyone else important... hence think I'd love stay home dad gig. But, started therapy help find balance there.

Anyway, wish family best. step-daughter lucky parent important get breaks ""you time""...hope find essential moments strength manage craziness parent! also represent patients acute COVID-19 infection **those completely asymptomatic COVID-19**

so, citation still needed Woa woa woa. Thats respiratory issues thats straight cognitive function. long history panic attacks cognitive issues? Sorry inherent point replacing tenured faculty adjunct.  
 Even engineering salaries nothing compared administration. Full prof nearing retirement engineering making 159k, deans make much move there's many now. Combined basically tenure anymore. administration officials say original directive came governor feared hospital system would overwhelmed focused creating much hospital space possible.  welcomed one many hospital systems nursing homes surveyed AP‚Äôs count. Northwell Health said three medical centers overtaxed one point put ICU patients hallways. relieve pressure, company eventually sent 1,700 COVID-19 patients nursing homes.  say, hospitals stress,‚Äù spokesman Terence Lynam said.

NY State's Report: NY nursing homes admitted patients area hospitals already COVID-positive residents, broadly speaking patients area hospitals introducing virus nursing homes. Furthermore, report shows rise positive cases nursing homes correlates rise nursing home employees' infection rates.

The idea NY failed elderly due Cuomo's directive match broader regional national statistics nursing home York‚Äôs nursing home fatalities disproportionate rest nation (See, Background, Infra.), neighboring states‚Äîdespite populations much lower New York‚Äôs‚Äîillustrates per capita basis, New York one lowest fatality rates nursing homes neighboring states (Appendix C).

Another article backs homes assisted living facilities account 45% COVID-19 deaths nationwide, compared New York's 20%.

EDIT: Cuomo's directive makes complete sense looking back NY's rise new cases mid-March peak April (and considering dire early predictions NY hospitalizations). However, time modified directive May 10th, NY clearly hump. see people feel changed course couple weeks earlier. incubate present quick. student infected first day. I'm testing testing processing equipment process on.

But also believe people saying ""we this"" ones ""could"" it, go looking someone it, they'll find one.

Building something similar Abbot ARCHITECT involves bringing kinds technology. kind takes years set assembly lines for. complex opto-electronics, especially.  Pretty filled anxiety colleges returning, reason people are. need schools come back see friends again. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll they‚Äôre stuck home another year  can't speak specific cases facts - also familiar enough German healthcare system comment intelligently better worse US system.

But sort general answer ton cases, massive demand molecular testing, enough labs lab technicians. 

We 14,000 cases per million people, Germany 2,500 confirmed cases per million people. massively demand - since every confirmed case going create need test everyone came contact confirmed case.

The problem can't quantify (beyond case numbers) available data can't find discerns molecular antigen testing, obviously want talk molecular testing instance. Ad blocker blocking article me. private prison?

Edit: Got past ad block. woman held Coleman Federal Correctional Complex. Federal prison operated feds. private prison. clue reddit harping them. brought school. That's entire point. got it. I‚Äôm curious, long screening take? like actual testing results aren‚Äôt immediate? 

If so, admitting students advance? It‚Äôs lot easier try shut everything managed do. would‚Äôve lot cheaper. mean fear mongering? ‚Äú10 million people going die don‚Äôt lockdown!!‚Äù media saying justify shit. goalposts moved it‚Äôs established protocol.

I wish could go back statewide quarantine. I'm sure parishioner claim impacted people church parishioner history! [damn PS4 Youtube enough me. sure Netflix counts TV, though watch much anymore. didn't. already waiting test went school anyway. Wrong. According available data, taking Cessna snow storm get killed. therefore opinion pilot says ""don't worry, we'll fine."" factually incorrect. anyone respects man calling statement ""opinion"" foolish is. yet shooting victims need resort crowdfunding. Even coronavirus doesn‚Äôt make sense dare know well! Superintendents everywhere like, ‚ÄúIgnore! Ignore!

Minority not, virus bound one group problem forces without restrictions contact quarantine. Someone non-distanced classroom tests positive, everyone goes home 14 days. Childcare centers remained open using small, ""podded"" (no mix) groups reason. 

Normal school operations, gets community, never going end unless school closed long time. Alternative solution:
 
* Students grades 6 - 12 begin school year fully remote
* Students grades K - 5 begin school year fully school
* K - 5 students utilize vacant classrooms higher grade levels would occupied order reduce density
* Hire large number younger, healthier Teachers' Assistants - focus recently graduated unemployed
* teachers fall categories associated negative COVID-19 outcomes, assign one multiple TAs classroom teacher teaches remotely
* Evaluate specific regional circumstances monthly basis adapt accordingly Nope. That‚Äôs hurricane effect. Interesting. find adjustable piece back cinch face better. I'll keep mind looking. Parents prepare yourselves. may lose little ones. :( wondering much testing decrease reporters start calling claiming testing great.

Of great, meet demand? Nice Yes, people look fondly educators striking totally vote raise taxes pay money /s

To clear, think totally strike definitely underpaid. don‚Äôt think would get much done states voters control education budgets.  pretty much recurring theme, every problem have, like healthcare excessive police force, anything else. always get hyperbolic end world answers. good. Need make nationwide thing. Boo! 

Did get you? asked willing sacrifice get kids house, deflected.

 asked willing sacrifice get kids house, deflected. deflect? would marry anyone stupid right. thinking Bush's warnings pandemic pandemic lot like forest fire,"" Bush said time. ""If caught early might extinguished limited damage. allowed smolder, undetected, grow inferno spread quickly beyond ability control it."" virus obliterated worldwide, can't anything? would go even preventing something like happening inevitably anyways. virus free eliminated. many people many countries are. Even New Zealand surge again. Eliminating one place change thing costs much. ever man believe ever bullshit want to. kids well school, particularly middle school, great opportunity schools handle issues direct comment author article/headline. using exact type structure write headlines like ""Ten people test positive attending weekend pool party"" clearly meant imply got virus party. (the journalist) write shitty headlines articles like one leaves interpretation.

I 100% agree kid already infected. article made zero attempt actually reporting facts logistics matter. cities still way denser anything else there. comparing NY State FL saying Florida better fewer deaths per million. Let's pretend easy. What's deal Spain, Italy UK then? one answers tough questions make better? hand sanitizer local liquor store puts customers use upon entering store smells fantastic!!!
Just saying...  begins. fuck? hope take action November well...or filling mail ballot applications now. absolutely terrible idea put kids school right now. Good luck staff enforcing mask wearing distancing. send link story please? Remote learning kid last semester 2 hours zoom calls week second grader. That's trash. notion good enough younger kids garbage. not. Stop saying it. 

1. ways around that. High schoolers remote learn better kindergarten. empty high school shuffle kids there. Use cafaterias gyms art rooms.

2. Wear mask can't socially disnance themselves. See first post safe.

3. assumption based upon notion originally safe. never never been. Life risks. Per cdc 400 kids 10 2019 died flu. shut school that. metal detectors every entrance armed cops every room.

MA got shit control. open. Florida doesn't. open. gets control, close. It‚Äôs complete bullshit unless Elon gives source studies estimated 69% (nice)

Either way, would certainly keep open mind whatever level immunity NYC achieved major causative factor outcome we‚Äôre seeing, perhaps primary factor. Wait minute. thought literally never entered mind whole debate, fuck schools even opening first week August anyways? Pandemic pandemic makes absolutely sense. kid I‚Äôd want kill school first week August. glad school district switched pre-labor day graduated highschool. talked going year round two week breaks in-between 9week semesters. seem like anyone wants give 2 months summer  decimal? one infected person school eventually lead massive outbreak matter way slice it. Kids take home, infect parents. Parents take work infect coworkers. Coworkers take home, infect kids, kids go school infect classmates. means die whatever period time deemed acceptable recovered (usually 30 days).

I'm ""recovered"" still showing symptoms 4 months later. Parents hamper progress just..loving much. Don‚Äôt judge. It‚Äôs easy think can‚Äôt reality can; struggle hurts. oBjecTiviTy ""gOoD FaITh""

Ftfy. seems they'd rather chaotic shit show, par way everything else handled country right now.

i guess best way get behind motives grand catastrophe ""follow money"", even info easily accessible public. I'm pretty sure looked distribution commenting saw 68% sampling distribution contained within one standard deviation mean. However, we're concerned lower tail, normal distribution halve 32% outside 1sd range get 16%. sure meant 'conservative' comment. country realize internet access needs treated necessary utility revenue stream try save dying cable industry. far good. contrast NBA situation MLB , think NBA style bubble way go.  Unfortunately easier said done. facilities still employ healthcare workers general population. it‚Äôs population, death isn‚Äôt thing impact people. Lots younger people dealing reduced lung capacity still aren‚Äôt well months later. flu, frankly don‚Äôt know long term effects right now. ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù. Assuming NY going back pre covid days accurate. It‚Äôs going gradual, data driven approach see works doesn‚Äôt. fear mongering I‚Äôve seen media. Stonks get education google library. education system fundamentally flawed business. students forced cram vast amount useless information won‚Äôt remember quarter semester ends. Look general education courses. usually don‚Äôt anything student‚Äôs particular field. know benefits GEs, sheer amount forced upon students promote true learning, it‚Äôs colleges take money.

Edit: forced take GE class philosophy nothing major. professor made us buy book one actually ever read. Easy class. point? school take money, professor make money one interested enough actually buy book enjoyment. No? Wtf? context means didn‚Äôt CATCH first day school. went school already sick tested positive. Arguably thats worse since likely infected dozens others won‚Äôt know least week good saving economy workers die? Think much tax revenue already lost 150k+ dead already money generated economy working. getting worse.

Saw best comment described virus going destroy US

Coronavirus: ""Want ruin economy kill people?"" 

USA: ""...""

Coronavirus: ""OK. I'll take both."" 55 grand ... semester?  also criminal negligence allow happen first place (Airlines, Cities, States, Administration)? That's impossible, NBA would bubble. Goodness, I'm shocked! Possibly:

 Schools US normally end late May/ early June resume August Well, it's, know, there, and... yes, somehow, know how, it'll go away. farthestest far that's ever been. Ninjas hot Halloween costume! Coughing someone pandemic? worker gets sick, assault problem decisions pushed lower levels.

No federal response ""it's different different states."" federal government abstains taking responsibility so...

This argument gets pushed governors. want take blame either. counties, districts, even business individuals ""they decide what's best themselves.""

This lack leadership. Someone, somewhere needed say ""look, I'm going make decision know needs happen. going perfect, going pretty, I'm probably going take huge short-term political loss this, right thing do.""

Some governors done - Cuomo got absolutely *blasted* good decisions, especially decision send recovered-but-not-cured people back care homes. great decision, like given playbook Feds, Trump, CDC, really anyone.

It's every man right now. School administrators extra funds, extreme political financial pressure. Wtf INDIVIDUAL superintendent going do? shut down, going get lit fire constituents probably fired.  Seriously. boomer relative send chain meme August 5 Saturdays, 5 Sundays, 5 Mondays happens every 800+ years. told boomer happens every years told next time would happen (May 2021) next time would happen August (2026). basically said ""but image says every 800 years"" millennial trying explain 60 something year old adult people internet lie. conversation ended relative still believing refusing look next year's calendar.

This relative side political spectrum would expect saying would make post political. relative votes. People like reason COVID response horrible. Facts literally matter them. good point, studied different european country classes also group 25-30 kids even **all** classes together would mix kids potentially recess lunch time. Educational system vary much countries, even consider american one different schedule classes every kid. wait. we‚Äôre outraged use idioms. swear God catch man saying ‚ÄúOne hand better two bush‚Äù.. Eh, South Park kinda shitty comes sort thing. likely they'd episode making fun pro-mask side. Buy wheelchair doesn‚Äôt kill makes stronger /s Go back r/conspiracy. Impossible. America would invaded enemy Saudi Arabia somewhere true. sounds like friends family gatherings, perhaps except summer. 

Well, go far. things already technically allowed place due increased gathering limit sizes ""social bubbles"" implemented allowing people get together family friends. may case countries shit bed responding COVID-19 appropriately, like US, already largely acceptable parts world long people smart it. Even north border Canada. planes still 150-200 seats though.

So 6% population infected, half don‚Äôt even know it, you‚Äôre still almost guaranteed sick people plane. dont want need ""live life lockdown"". 3-5 weeks proper mitigation move lives using basic precautions control.

It's shitty we're still asking August March. ignoring problem yet another month plan. pushing epidemic road. September we'll wishing started today. October we'll wish September. on.

We know beat virus. point accept it. everyday wait makes harder. r/accidentalzen Depends are. I‚Äôm Rochester, hospital house testing. Results 4-6 hours. Brooklyn here, ~90% people see wear mask, walking street, enter stores. 

We got shit! 1% death rate optimistic, lower current 3.3% death rate. either liar fool quite get point. Yes, choice think agree much harder choice others. right. Currently nothing bad choices lot people. problem people, though, government. actually government (taxes) ... taking care people situations feasible citizens manage individually. maintain military same, exact purpose. pool together nation (taxes) pay military, would defend what? thing interstate roads education.

This literally point government. see you‚Äôre brain dead politicians.

A lot families afford keep kids home choice. doesn‚Äôt mean agree it, options. speaking F-35 program, cost gone past 1 trillion dollars yet. Projections completion maintenance accumulate beyond that, still plurality trillion. UBI. UBI. people without kids, mainly old people care kids education anymore since think doctors lawyers grow trees, (I kids keep school starts) need stfu ""school starting"" September's problem, schools live started September since 10 (I'm fucking 30). Schools started late Aug life, even college. state recently pushed school year mid aug. Schools starting MONTHS issue. Go ahead, open envelope keep pissing lot people university we‚Äôre reopening nobody wants to, lower end departments said don‚Äôt student workers half full time workers laid due lack funds student worker don‚Äôt know I‚Äôd pay rent apartment sign lease last November shithole.

The people describe suck hate people keep trying lump try say need open people don‚Äôt lose jobs.  WISH could stay home safe sadly isn‚Äôt ideal world need pay bills people too. already fire. like throwing ammonium nitrate it. knew spell understand thus edit.

The union analogy strawman argument example disproving original notion connected... notion mercy boss... yada yada yada... nothing programming.

And serological tests believed, around 20% NYC got COVID-19, 1.6 million. 23,000 deaths 1.6 million would work be... 1% fatality rate. Which, I'm mistaken, worse 0.9% fatality rate called doomsaying.

That's poster referring to. controversial theory. supporting reasons like certain large cities plateued dropped off. others like Bergamo Queens Neighborhood hit much higher numbers ease, calling question. 

There probably lot factors play, think herd immunity going black/white COVID. think realistically hit nationwide without vaccine anytime soon. Although exponential spread areas could interesting case study. Unmitigated spread basically happening states, might see drops owns near future. Hard say.  both?

A redneck piece shit left home 18 broken family. Even though know inaccurate, seriously missed ""much lower"" Saturday/Sunday false sense security numbers.  Trump‚Äôs mantra true! Less testing means fewer cases. Florida proved Trump‚Äôs point. Let‚Äôs stop testing altogether, across whole country, let‚Äôs attribute covid19 deaths pneumonia, like Florida doing, cases deaths. US become corona free. hope so. scary first seems smart even without pandemic going around. Unfortunately America doesn‚Äôt wear mask pandemic, way we‚Äôll wear one without. plan get vaccine. family get vaccine. can‚Äôt control others fully recognize many won‚Äôt get vaccine, possibly meaning Covid sticks around. 

My plan though, get vaccine, continue social distancing kicks in, start let kids us return degree normalcy. I‚Äôm thinking masks, saying sleepovers, eating inside restaurants. we‚Äôll watch idiots die covid refused vaccine.

I also monitor long term immunity decide point could risk again. Hopefully would years line.

My question: really think November? what, 350 million people country? Let‚Äôs assume third want first round vaccines. 117 million give take.

We may enough vaccinate everyone wants it. need two doses, could possibly vaccinate half want it. quickly make another 100 million doses? point being, sounds like want could get somewhat quickly. rolls November, could vaccinated Christmas? maybe late celebration January vaccine like minded friends? Thanks posting this. work radiology found pretty interesting. implied Texas mask mandate, month. also claimed Texas still experiencing record high days ""on regular"", even though case largest cities Texas new cases per day positive test rate stats downward trend since mask mandate. now, assuming take pandemic seriously, effected it, simply pointed misinformation.

Despite virtue signaling, I'm disagreeing coronavirus tragic, likely mishandled certain areas. Again, simply pointing misinformation. Yes, that's plan. paying attention? go look social distancing wealth gaps. Also it‚Äôs seeing family. work restaurant telling people wear masks insulting intelligence. can‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt get paid.

COVID-19 disproportionately affects low-income essential workers disproportionately black due slavery, Jim Crow, segregation. ""victims racism"" sounds accurate me. like 'haha, bullet go boom'. I'm going lie that; fucking fun shoot guns!

BUT! also believe need maintain sensible gun control laws. think shooting shit fun mean need anything stock pistols, shotguns, rifles. Plus, safety classes re-upped every year two instead five years. shit constantly drilled people's heads.

I mean, also like safely blowing shit desert, think allowed buy dynamite; ya know?

Thank coming TED Talk. ""May cause"", even know real issue expect people continue wear mask distance loved ones years, they're lazy middle pandemic.

*Insert shocked Pikachu face* Yes, can. It‚Äôs hard. Limit gatherings, wear masks, social distance. shut beaches  literally kill old people though. 90% US deaths people 55 older.

It also well known orders put covid patients nursing homes New York 4 States made lion's share 90%. Cuomo put resuscitate orders people heart beat, FDNY, ignored order. Cuomo's piece shit.

You‚Äôd surprised often planes cleaned now, I‚Äôm pilot I‚Äôm actually really surprised almost time airlines actually cleaning much say are.  Thing schools arent paying quality schools, pay prestige. get better education school 1/10 cost. People want degree prestige Yale logo it, gives edge resumes people think ivy league must genius, reality... well look Trump... !RemindMe 4 weeks way Americans use word ""American"" tells lot way see themselves. Basically ""American"" best way go things, hence ""un-American"" equals failing regard. issue contention whether perceived American way works, another culture may found better way deal something, whether lived perfection ""America"" represents. Yes, yes is.  

I feel sorry lack leadership bipartisan infighting country. stolen feds? so, quickly? pandemic starkly shown, 3 certainties life: death, taxes human stupidity. headline sub ""give two weeks""

And 2 weeks

""2 weeks""

How much evidence people need coronavirus finished Sweden Don‚Äôt go CityMD, go hospital house lab. Make mistake either - nurses going, already exhausted fighting, sometimes having, disease, die result.  This. 100%. 
I live Louisiana second wave. Many articles point New Orleans (the hot spot first wave) largely spared second time around. live city, likely know several people effected. hitting hard areas state like Lafayette, Lake Charles, Baton Rouge, Shreveport area. first wave rest state viewed ‚ÄúNew Orleans problem‚Äù. carried lives. New Orleans shut fuck down. Outside New Orleans, restrictions largely ignored even April May. state started loosening restrictions (that ignored begin with) things went back normal them. Outside city restaurants packed, nobody masks, parties, ect.. didn‚Äôt know single person effected convinced pandemic blown proportion. 

On flip side- New Orleans still ghost town (apart tourist STILL coming here!). People New Orleans mostly wearing masks. someone throwing boil, it‚Äôs outdoors, half amount people, everyone spaced apart. People also calling folks large gatherings. Masks distancing become second nature most. still- none happening outside New Orleans Looks like things getting better White House controls data. state? right? grew Canada experience. wonder reason shifting back month?  anything pandemic taught us is, entity sitting large sums cash suffering since still pay employees, expenses not. 

Just saying. one asthma THIS.

I breath without much trouble mask cannot way worse fucking expose self virus. Oh vaccine out? Yep that‚Äôs honest I‚Äôll wear mask I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôm healthy F too. bowl cut? Don‚Äôt fly? pay $800 hour class, teacher gets barely $25 per hour. really think schools expencive cos teachers get overpaid? Post-viral fatigue common influenza too, mention chickenpox, mumps ... cured doesn‚Äôt make feeling healthy. teachers focusing rather pensions. Well assume every kid cold too. That's big issue testing delays. capacity react quickly enough keep anything open. quarantine every person kid came contact results. Imagine looks like school. Ok something think positive silver lining this.



I lived small town every conceivable job outside McDonald's waffle house filled old people, clearly past retirement age. Like people borderline need go care facility, since everyone jobs knew other/ family/ friends, replaced.



Town practically ghost town cause young people families moving away better prospects. good point, immediate thought seeing this. Who‚Äôs asshoel parent took photo? They‚Äôre ones deciding baby‚Äôs memory fun prom important human life. Great lesson teach kids...

The worst parents include decide kids don‚Äôt need learn important life lessons kid reaches teens, don‚Äôt appreciate ‚Äúbig kids‚Äù also learn parents example, teach kids experiences (AKA prom, wedding, etc) big important impactful identity it‚Äôs worth putting mental/physical health risk, and/or wellbeing others.

These parents really, really fucked up. none wanted see sufficient social distancing place, standard maintained throughout evening? definition prom involves two people different households stand room couples different households, stand near hours... :/ willing fly. Don‚Äôt leave shit chance. always brought disinfecting wipes wipes everything planned touch seat mate would touch onto plane. seat mates always asked extra same. country chose money people. first thing used clean toilet seats surrounding areas used pillowslips.

Wait. What? 90% kids asymptomatic. kids fine they're seriously going quietly spread every parent teacher school district. selfishness rampant nothing party lines. Take time read comments covid related threads. Take note many people talk risk vs many talk risk endangers others. Many mask supporters, taking seriously, etc STILL make decisions based personal risk alone. don‚Äôt listen anyway. lol  8 hours? teacher fears retribution death including death around deserves whatever coming them.  I'm fucking bullshit. Yes people change stuff. People hygienic wash hands, stop going work sick, hopefully get sick leave mental health breaks. you‚Äôd surprised many people think never go public ever it‚Äôs mostly people social media, it‚Äôs problem. See problem people say goal posts keep moving:

First flatten curve.

Then wait vaccine.

Then even vaccine may still social distance wear masks. 

This nobody follows guidelines UK something called ‚ÄúOpen University‚Äù decades though lower class uni relies remote part-time learning. 
Now everyone else paying basically thing double cost.

I don‚Äôt understand US uni‚Äôs charge much anyway, lowering cost best separated reality, worst deliberately profiteering.
First year students put going uni actually worth price. seeing lot headlines next month. compare nurses suffer Covid. I'm nurse, fatigue days, part job. maybe part adult. 

I'm trying downplay seriousness pandemic. Post-viral fatigue definitely real thing, may serious Covid infections, study really helpful telling us common Covid unless pre-Covid baseline fatigue surveys affected, compare healthy control groups. Yeah. took specific posted demand/order shutdown essentially losing license, might case--or still going operate without one. sure still going despite specific order ignoring general order.

If to, chain door(s) shut, impose fines great completely economically unviable keep disobeying it, much hate say it, make arrests.

They treat like place decides run despite getting shut rats roaches serving putrid/spoiled food. Restaurants always highly regulated businesses. like he's never appease local board health meet specific standards (that might chosen own) keep operating. read things use call ppl stupid. Good day. April anyway... literally matter. Wife works nursing home. says second third shift workers barely wear masks PPE appropriately (they're supposed wear gowns, shields, gloves N95s). Plus, patient admitted facility unless two negative tests.


The result? 18/20 patients hallway positive Covid now. 4 already died.


I guess point pointless prevent visits workers complete idiots infect everyone anyway. Might well let old folks see families inevitably fight lives. Heard married couple got tested. awaiting results flewa across country see family. arrived received positive test wife negative. immediately flew back home wife, presumed positive, went stay extended family.


People idiots Tell damn red neck nobody nothing red Trump hat lose protecting listening science. people protecting protecting others. someone top 10 uni, paying connections brand name, learn stuff can't already learn google, YT, textbook. Per test, apperantly research done get answers. Seems like likely reasonable duration immunity cells antibodies fade, seems like many vaccines give decent immune response.

I would say vaccine things largely return normal. Concerts, sports, live large events allowed.

Will rid us covid? No. It‚Äôs contagious get rid of. 

But majority people safe administered vaccine? Likely. used work side online learning. actually work professor make engaging high quality online class. however record f2f lectures peace out. see saying. lot work would like paid accordingly. However, paid (in person teaching) got. paid book got DVD instead might seek partial refund. Even DVD book material. mention learning styles adapt online, really loosing paid for. balance. paid hard work put in, customer also entitled way, get paid for. Maybe moment universities say pay top much, make sure teachers get paid, customers happy. Honestly that's pretty good outcome Everyone realized .05% mortality rate better chance dying way practice covid. assume parents even informed possibility. Wake headline reads: ""Corporations Buy Back Stock Taxpayer Funded Bail-Outs"" actually commonly allowed practice many schools. absolutely 100% choice.  liking choice cause cease exist.  matter life death.  Teachers walking public schools reopen choosing death death personally effects despite knowing consequence risking lives students families.  makes better anti-maskers honestly lost lot respect teachers recently  hear ""me me"" little regard anyone else.

It clear getting virus control going happen take solace knowing people's selfishness pandemic ultimately going take out.  may sound cold getting harder harder sympathy people know better still make wrong choice potentially ruin life lives around them. Eh, they‚Äôll forced something. doubt politicians involved ever actually *care.* Even touches clothes, you‚Äôre going touch clothes later and/or touch stuff touching clothes. point possibly touching mouth eyes. Reddit care. people severe social anxiety would love nothing everyone live like them. never crossed minds people enjoy together things publicly normal setting. care wearing masks forever ridiculous insane. Everyone I‚Äôve seen trying downplay virus talks death count. don‚Äôt even care enough find lasting effects exist. Might depression isolation Yeah wore mask took plenty sanitizer wipes planes *before* pandemic OCD fear contamination so... going disagree, sadly Glorious Leader give damn anything anyone himself. must take care one take care you.

If take care take care themselves, people survive Trump Genocide. innocent victims much done it. Wut? Im Quebec got last week Half people posting thread concern trolls That's true state institutions, Yale private. Explain sitting fat stacks helps community. Can't tell serious not... hopeless. end least become manageable. need patience.

I'm also struggling school opening. choose teenagers physical health mental health. days feel trapped, want scream sky. seems impossible right now. hope eventually get semblance normal want people around healthy enjoy make awful time. fly N95 may take getting used haven‚Äôt worn one make sure it‚Äôs fitted properly. Southwest requires wear mask entirety flight. saw crews wiping seats tray tables layover flight attendants offered sanitizer wipes wipe well. felt safe flying. lived CT entire life, never voted red, like DeSantis. None relevant here. We're talking numbers. mean initially.  know it'll keep happening. could started least days visible cases school. Anyways, get they're open all.  We're opening school Sept Ontario, least 100 cases day average. people probably learned everything accord like do. I'm sure people go nice schools nice neighborhoods funding get decent education kids afford taught home need they're really I'm worried Yes - scenarios listed infections peak go down, well vaccines. 

When say over, mean significantly less infections seeing now. people supposed know got airplane? Right we‚Äôre anything confirm that. comparison: German, quite easy read.The graphs sho deaths per week selected countries.

Blue line: Average deaths per week (2016-2019) Look, 30's coved kill children, problem. /s That‚Äôs virus getting ready go back school believe it‚Äôs every 2 days. There‚Äôs never case kids school. 1 million years. It‚Äôs closed quite time nobody‚Äôs inside it. PoW!!!!  proved there‚Äôs transmission kids school.

I pass sending kids back school. find interesting lose job Wear masks? Sure, that‚Äôs hard. Social distance? Hell No. you‚Äôre missing point saying, giving 2+ years social lives vaccine out, ridiculous. Flu contagious, studies show 77% could simply asymptomatic, still transmitting disease course. hell union protecting teachers‚Äô actual lives? livelihoods, actual *lives*! He's guy charge. Saying phrase, me, like saying, ""I can't anything it."" job take charge make things happen. Specifically CEOs. job get funding company, ‚Äúsell‚Äù business successful. C‚Äôs exist make sure CEO doesn‚Äôt fuck everything short-sightedness

Talking large companies here. contact tracing shit. Many kids parents going work, offices large metro areas never closed. Corona showing parties alone infecting kids, know kid brought party got family member someone else.

The point is, kids returning school, none really relevant since nearly EVERYONE forced situations likely cause transmission outbreaks U.S. sucks contact tracing. Also, employers held accountable way, shape, form contributing spread let's keep blaming young people partying ways. smacks media spin meant detract fact adults kids lives mostly FAILED MISERABLY, especially state federal level.  Thank you! Um that‚Äôs true get fucked You‚Äôre ridiculous. Considering anti mask father law flew last week claims never said anything wearing mask, don‚Äôt think standards great. It‚Äôs flu bro. Goddamn shut up.


Over 150 thousand people dead y‚Äôall still saying dumb shit ""If one dies kid, dont pay child support anymore."" mean doctors know next nothing? middle aged Americans üòÇ mattered many people supported it. competent leader provides leadership, good leader motivates people follow even misgivings, offers incentives. incompetent administration provides strategy all.

If states chose exclude supply information, funds, personnel, masks, ventilators, federal government, choice. live dictatorship. STRATEGY, failure failure. Seattle? I‚Äôm Eastern WA everyone pretty much 100% masked up. take would recommend flying days? 130,000 schools US. Killing innocent people without even attempting due process üëéüèª

Arresting protesters violating first amendment right üëéüèª

Arresting charging people actively endangering others throwing parties pandemic üëçüèª Probably can‚Äôt get enough bookings. love says risk stats show US already slid anti-intellectualism üòÇ thing 'accidental murder'. Considering many children already died, US, it‚Äôs infected nowhere near even close 100% population, number pure fucking bullshit.


Stop spreading lies! part Canada

*sobs insurance premiums* I've heard unfortunate number times, thank able look beyond punctuation flaws accept ideas laid out. Good luck ! could change things turn South around? turnaround time exceptional!  Bet outcome would significantly different.

Why? Schools pretty much similar Western world. doubt Australian classrooms *that* much different American ones. 

What facing uncomfortable reality. Reopening schools uniformly bad idea. jurisdiction, might appropriate. others, reopening schools fine. 

But narrative popular press is, unfortunately, *all* school reopenings flawed. is, unfortunately, necessarily scientific. Wow... imagine kind drinks 19y/o would ordered Germany.   use bleach water, clean surfaces touch hands. Car handles, wheel. door knobs. think mean blood sample (antibody test past infection) nasal swab sample (PCR test active infection). Yes, US too, test 4-5 samples together, case positive test, retest individual samples. Common sense tell.......wait saying. *hops back time machine* seem hate people act like too. look like them, worship worship, believe politicians, disdain you. Whatever happened ""love thy neighbor"" ""e pluribus unum?"" care lots. U-S-A! U-S-A! We're last means we're first! voted today one motherfucker running polls wore mask.  ‚ÄúEven you‚Äôre car crash, put COVID bonus, know someone happened ‚Äù- coworker, recently. Yup. reaction 300 new cases per day nationwide... ya? could we've reached testing plateau massive backlog tests. would mean less tests resulting less cases, even virus spreading. Southwest flew 3,000+ flights per day pre-covid. 10 got blown sky every day still slightly higher survival percentage flying Southwest covid.

So surely people wouldn‚Äôt stop flying, would say, ‚Äú99% chance don‚Äôt die, people afraid stay home.‚Äù April devastating. peak 969 deaths 24 hours IIRC.   Id bet left nut Ok, California then?  first time learn viruses? live before? isnt really really good thing? means mortality rate 6-24x smaller Looks like drop yesterday's reported 300-ish cases (so far, though Tokyo's numbers tend 1 report day).

Do know changes testing capacity actual tests done Tokyo day? ‚ÄúWe've arranged global civilization crucial elements profoundly depend science technology. also arranged things almost one understands science technology. prescription disaster. might get away while, sooner later combustible mixture ignorance power going blow faces.‚Äù

Carl Sagan someone always wanted go US museums cool shit like im pretty sad Yeah playing football begin pandemic, since, know, physical contact sport. Also masks would come kids get tackled shit !remindme two weeks never give even inch freedom.

At first ""Just lockdown flatten curve, thats all!!""

Then ""Just social distancing little while, thats all!!""

Then ""Just wear facemasks vaccine, thats really all!""

Now ""Wear masks forever, fuckers!""

&amp;#x200B;

In apects, since saw several ""Obesity makes covid worse, lets order people get fit"", shitshow went ""You spend free time want"" across ""You dress want"" apparently ""You eat want!"" ok since kids kindergarten school got gunned training sounds ruff exception oxford right ? @ last part  Seriously though, charge terrorism thrown around lightly. Dang sucks experienced that. went kid Epcot ended favorite park food delicious af. Thats exactly Fernando Sim√≥n, Spanish government's main epidemiologist director CCAES (Centro de Control de Alertas Emergencias Sanitarias) told us. Back March people severe conditions tested. Spanish testing capacity average 45.000 daily PCR tests, capacity find, trace isolate infected people Texas. Abbott finally gave implemented decent rules things got bad. Omg horror üò±,......., listen pathetic world become suspicious wildlife lets get close enough transmit disease. like afford trip Galaxy‚Äôs Edge next several years anyway. 

:(  probably see trashy neighbors south saying ""nope dont want become that"" Forget luxury items; who‚Äôs going pay taxes? Just, wow...  sub gone shit. everyone rude belligerent?

If say careful, get downvoted responses like ‚Äúyou need live life‚Äù ‚Äústop overacting‚Äù

Its regime change yessir

given 9 month old dying COVID extremely, unbelievably rare, I'm pretty sure story sad indeed, heart goes family SARS1 scared Canadians cough arms instead hands. Canadians tend follow public health directives better americans. problem tests high false negative rate. Standard lab-collected PCR swabs already fairly high false negative rate, trained person swabs deep nasal passage. home kit stick q-tip nose. autoimmune disease brain fog fatigue chronic. would sell soul wake one day suddenly gone. trying downer, I'm extremely jealous haha. inspire idolize good, makes think fact good too.

One argument heard young people would party anyway, better somewhere leave contact information illegal partys contact tracing would impossible.

Edit: mention one canton/state already closed clubs found 40% recent infection happenend. might matter time cantons same. Weird way say overworked post: Dumb southern rednecks get covid

Many severe Covid-19 patients often hospitalized weeks rather days typically spent intensive-care patient. translates fewer available beds Covid-19 patients arrive hospitals reopen others need intensive care. Texas, Florida Arizona, hospitals reported rising numbers Covid-19 patients intensive care July, forcing turn away ambulances transfer patients hundreds miles.

One early study Covid-19 patients California Washington found half ICUs remained least 10 days. pandemic, median patient remained intensive care two three days, studies show.

Mr. Mazzara remained Mount Sinai Hospital 44 days. spent 23 days intensive care.

Patients lengthy intensive-care stays key driver ICU expansions Mount Sinai cases New York surged. hospital expanded 10 intensive-care units, seven, require doctors nurses, technology monitor patients protect staff, re-engineered ventilation prevent virus circulating, said Roopa Kohli-Seth, director Institute Critical Care Medicine hospital. Absolutely.  revolution, masks protection. impression California homogenous state mean guess that's opinion entitled add opinion answering ""I follow hockey"" dumb answer ""when think next captain marvel release?"" I've never good small talk. People wanted something blame Autism awfully hard parents whose children it. People can't cope fact experts can't isolate children it. Yep one kids, kind shame whole situation happened Even Hitler thought ""good thing"". Maybe people starting get careful cautious. Isnt dumb alive got us mess?

Do understand exponential actually understand anything this? yet another parrot making false claims?


If infection keeps spreading, people keep fighting simple things like wearing mask standing feet away people...... exactly going stop everyone becoming infected?

Id like hear massively spread incredibly infectious virus cannot effectively treat yet magically stop spread eventually....

Come now. Explain detail. virus maintain alarming spread stop rest people become infected?


Come now

I recommend instead making pretending 9/11 level death every days.

 160,000 deaths MN, soon leave metro area becomes whole different mindset. live south I‚Äôm going say now, rarely see person without mask. time goes by, Steve Aylett's books make sense. headline total clickbait productive. want reach people change minds, maybe don‚Äôt start insulting them. probably know 1000 people personally lol

it'd bunch people inviting people +1 +5ing people Wow, many emotions they‚Äôre conflicting numerous ways. hope girl feels loved care her. hope mom dad assume responsibility child‚Äôs pain. hope brother feels loved beyond question possible doubt. One day, hope grandchildren ‚Äúenough‚Äù them.  I'm also aware that, whole, Georgia way rural areas New York California. 

So brazen ignorance...NY CA shit ton rural areas. CA MUCH rural area GA. could say something obviously wrong? Jesus. People like me? countries like: u/ProdigyRed__ reason can‚Äôt enter country? It‚Äôs called rock hard place. Lots people don‚Äôt savings would rather gamble covid homeless. would help government citizens instead trying squeeze life us corporate profits. I‚Äôll bet direct correlation states education ranking per capita virus numbers. crazy bet. first all, california, covid currently spreading rapidly places places government blatantly ignored experts, mainly south, notably florida, texas, georgia, arizona...

covid spread rapidly NY *in beginning* first place hit, one knew going on, densest city country, connected outside world, resources deal virus. beginning. ny listened experts everything right flattened curve back june. since safest place US. why? new yorkers listened respected science necessary. look curves, NY low flat roughly 2 months. true pretty much northeast. oregon's curve low flat recently well.

i dunno say california. extremely big state plenty pockets idiots. well right now. true? though lack sensitivity better used rapid diagnosis _symptomatic_ patients virus likely present. Like hospitals.

Look, problem people lack education. problem people *proudly anti-education*. experience several southern states lived in, blatant contempt expertise.  tell him, god gave us scientists listen brain use it.

I said one family. response accuse ""intellectualism Satan"".

I talk family much days. Christian interested science also run many people believe room religion science, I've found quote work fairly well.

I¬†do feel obliged believe God endowed us sense, reason, intellect intended us forgo use. - Galileo Galilei interest, parameter estimation simple exponential function two parameters (output scale/offset time scale) Israel's infection rate first 50 days second wave, averaged seven days normalized daily tests - 96% explained, would particular hump beginning reporting problems, would even better.

Of course, fear government measures break pretty soon countries, potential clearly there. /r/medicine might leads red except cities... Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Ithaca. Even Ithaca Syracuse represented Republicans. Lots Confederate flags Trump stickers. Thankfully, NYC surrounding areas turn us solidly blue presidential Senate votes HoR lots red. Vomit wear masks. protects us bit real payoff keeping healthy. return gesture human decency? someone south, healthcare provider less, it‚Äôs willful ignorance. brilliant medical minds working among us. live NC &amp; knowledge &amp; drive within Research Triangle Park community astounding. there‚Äôs UNC, Duke...just us VA Johns Hopkins, UVA, Walter Reid...the list continues Vanderbilt, Emory, U Birmingham, UFL...etc etc etc. There‚Äôs excuse. knowledge fingertips, yet fuck are. nephew works genetic testing trials, started &amp; graduated UNC Chapel Hill, &amp; got tf LA. don‚Äôt blame him, come man. need get shit together guys. *sighs Carolina blue‚Äù DJT‚Äôs excuse?

I'm man one oversaw kids virtual learning spring even though wife Teacher impossible administer everything students watching young kids. also one year, along potentially helping 2 children, even though district virtual require Teachers person School, isolated rooms. might ask? Karen's like can't say Teachers really working. 

I put business hold could work help others, continue so.

I also cook 90% meals dishes. suppose going tell man now?

Can us favor, god forbid gets Covid-19, let us know many times accused ""manflu"" tested positive? Facts used prove anything that‚Äôs remotely true Fairy tales bible camp go together pretty well.  would say .01% shows troll terribly ignorant. 

Since seen post many threads here, I‚Äôll go troll. ""method‚ÄØantibac‚ÄØspray formulated kill 99.9%‚ÄØof household germs, including influenza flu virus,‚ÄØstaphylococcus aureus, rhinovirus,‚ÄØsalmonella enterica, hard, non-porous surface.""

Generalizing including formulated kill 99.9%‚ÄØof household germs, including influenza flu virus,‚ÄØstaphylococcus aureus, rhinovirus,‚ÄØsalmonella enterica, hard, non-porous surface."" I'm sure scene playing communities across country but, possible. Honestly blew away 500 people call one point, district like 2600 kids. wonder level engagement common, sure expect it. They‚Äôre solid asymptomatic testing pedantic, would ""in development"", developed. lead horse water. can't arrest Jesus. ""Anti intellectualism""? called stupid, call fucking stupid ffs. People really stretching truth far nowadays cant call dumbdumbs, dumbdumbs know type well. trolls wrong every step way, eventually come data getting past days wrong. Nothing would make happier thing declining enough fall, things closer normal. started surging wait weeks deaths begin showing count

Edited fix typo   That's problem though. endemic now, never going go away. animals carry humans won't, cross back human population immunity. vaccine need, kinda suck turning quickly. people south, include southern states like Fl,Tx,Nm,Az cal. Minimum wage jobs intended kids getting workforce (15-20 year old), 25-40 year old lazy ass layabouts. failed research 101. Neat TN. don‚Äôt go out, it‚Äôs worth getting upset captain ass hole won‚Äôt wear mask. spread covid New York show? CA taking seriously now. see soooo many people bars restaurants. Bumming around without masks. started proactively one felt like inconvenienced anymore.  Congratulations proving point? Man, could've written this. 

I live Virginia. mess.  Even wearing N95 masks guarantee zero chance wearer getting infected.

But agree wearing mask limits infectability particular virus? already [reports tested positive, worn masks one around got infected. make outbreaks happen schools much manageable cases easier identify, especially combine measures. 

Don't agree way better zero masks zero guideline recommendations followed. ensure outbreak happen, knockout large number students staffs.

Countries like Singapore South Korea, managed reopen schools suffer school huge outbreaks seen here, masks practise enforced.

We know vaccine available mass anytime soon, disease continue plague us then. mean need stay home, need continue adapt situation move on, wearing masks must part strategy. You‚Äôve flown twice haven‚Äôt gotten sick. Great. please don‚Äôt perpetuate kind thinking. 

I‚Äôve taken 5% risk 4 times hasn‚Äôt hit yet (not surprising), therefore everyone take 5% risk like (and approx 100 1000 people act like hit risk)! worked me! didn‚Äôt get sick! Well expected. is. Obviously it‚Äôs fast positive test got school. wonder many spread test positive coming days. taken job Chick-fil-A pay bills, say company good job things. Managers enforce glove-changing, sanitizing, handwashing 30 minute intervals least. Handing food location contactless possible.

I try sanitize much possible people, even though half seem care. can't speak Chick-fil-A's many ones Nashville, TN, seem take seriously. point think they‚Äôre making kids point view, it‚Äôs either parents risk me, it‚Äôll 3 weeks. Either way they‚Äôll risk, could fun friends (kids short sighted). brother's girlfriend nurse got back April. still cough breathing symptoms 4 months later. GOP actively trying demonize Mom's locked arms Portland. 

I doubt they'll even blink shitting teachers. case you‚Äôre wondering, CDC estimates roughly **34,200 people United States died flu 2018-2019 flu season.** **twice many Americans died COVID-19 complications‚Ä¶ April 2020 alone.** Consider looking distance tutor too! Endowments mostly restricted spent on. Unrestricted $$ likely going towards operating cost shortfalls already, saved case goes beyond single term (into next year). words, school big endowment, doesn‚Äôt mean lot walking around money. Wear n-95 eye protection (safety glasses), bring disinfectant wipes, don‚Äôt touch face, hand sanitizers often think intentionality misleading make readers think child contracted school.

Major news outlets horrible. No, really. kind behaviour (selfishness narcissism) predicted people early 90‚Äôs internet made available worldwide. pandemic really showing effects created global connection. Time strike better pay feel underpaid. Every year work 45K another year guarantee change. even kid-sized N95s? Fit critical. literally slew popular posts talking sub alone. No, enforcement, mandate expires 2 weeks, really posturing anyway. Please send help. kid must exposed long first day school. headline little dicey. actually make claim. could someone died robust immune system. saying seen proof that. Perhaps could share know. know person? ""I actively hurt people ignoring experts personally affected me."" online year. Can't wait bit? probably years, graduate all. got day. going much better anticipated. What‚Äôs ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù bunch disease vectors around seven days thing bullshit. waiting time line anything else. wife medical technologist major hospital area get tests back day (both swab test antibody test) bought analyzers used testing. Federal Government made sure every hospital US provided proper testing machines able get results back day two depending backlog. another way we've failed government. Also, like, it‚Äôs wicked difficult eradicate virus. It‚Äôs really surprising experts predicting COVID never go away... Polio Measles still exist I‚Äôm really worried either them. That's pneumonia / pneumonia related effects you. got pneumonia October, unusual heavy weariness lasted like 3 weeks after. test takes several hours. Less 24 hours cases...

The problem actual test taking long, testing labs many places capacity.


Can't run X numbers tests day slots machine full. idea probably agree sentiment given replying comment Based numbers alone, good chance someone changed baby‚Äôs diaper tray table.

I labour gave (but husband) test. isolate us stay, probably okay. Restructure school year round shorter breaks like college years vaccine catch younger kids. Kids high school able continue studies online fall behind. whole lot.. reason choosing wear mask, throwing massive parties, pandemic, frowned upon essentially. Bet parents start singing different tune see child clinging life. didn‚Äôt know binary choice support support. posted reply this. three nurses know experiencing symptoms like this, two considering giving nursing due terrified making medication mistake already come close so. third leave absence couldn‚Äôt remember get home one night kept taking wrong turns, went wrong way street, realized didn‚Äôt stop stop sign. anymore Ahh yes, trashing MSNBC reporting actual facts. fault, really.

Facts liberal bias, amirite, snowflake? Yep, mandate expires 2 weeks, really anything. :/ Trust CNN? Ehhhhhhh, No. old saying goes, 'denial river Egypt'. 
 
Just stubbornly want accept reality stop reality existing. tell saved money naming department saying *teachers* fault? fucking serious? 
 
my wife **get** **decide** teaching face-to-face - that's district board *ruled*. going back, guess could quit - option family, superior health insurance family. 
 
it's *teachers*, dumbass. parents administration. 
 
so enlighten me, u/xarnzul, selfish teacher terrified go back teach, so, job? would say deserve commendation brave amidst rampant stupidity. 
 
gtfo wall text bullshit. Probably partly they're tired partly ""I've gone long without catching it. Must real problem""  act like idiot immunity instant.

For fucks sake, read damn vaccines. Anitgenic testing takes less hour. Even quicker PCR tests take less 3 hours now. People really understand terrifying brain fog be. me, disease, taken benzodiazapenes prescribed nearly decade. got horribly depressed time hobbies interests focus long enough much anything. know work suffered well- reason lose job PTO I'd saved years then, boss supervisor understanding going through.

But full year brain fog finally began recede, entire time, terrified there'd permanent damage, I'd never fully regain cognition. Needless say, notion catching Covid going absolutely horrifying me. Yes, I'm Quebec too. app.

 mean Qu√©bec plan integrate app backend healthcare system anytime soon. reporting notification part app useful while. wife ER nurse got months ago still suffering this, tough deal coworkers also gotten virus suffering way, least others seem fine. think ia finished, authorities think finished anything current rise infection levels countries ""finished"" May shows nobody finished vaccine gained immunity. unpredictable secondary complications effects Covid are, nobody sane try get sick purpose. Truly inspiring quote come from? doesnt matter, matters Yale name resume hits partners desk guess news then, companies care dirty laundry aired public. flown Southwest American. Southwest flights seat passenger required face masks cover nose/mouth. American packed plane full plenty people noses masks flights. Take window seat less air circulation less people walking around. Also don‚Äôt use bathroom. Sanitize seat keep mask on. Don‚Äôt take all! ha ha, live teach :) Fell love soon taught first course. in-person learning clearly preferred, what‚Äôs going happen time find one kids COVID? going quarantine entire class, two weeks. Teachers too? kid rode bus, quarantined two weeks, bus driver. walked hallways, went bathroom? pandemic disruptive in-person learning wonder effective all. saying pandemic made much ""out about"" before? school reopening plans hinge children acting like children. don‚Äôt like chances. can‚Äôt get legislators act like adults goodness sake. Oh yeah definitely. Sorry unclear 10000000% think opening schools. Israel good case study even loan factions thought okay basically immediately huge uptick cases. 

I think we've already seen bunch instances across country schools reopening immediately outbreaks must missed memo. think primary vector, still vector it? one example, google tropical storm Isaias. Like, even know that, secluded bubble man? B6 B12? Uhhh wrong? friends mine want send kids school! (We live Georgia) get it‚Äôs hard home another two+ months scary. I‚Äôm keeping kids home long can. I‚Äôm afraid ask lemon party wife back pre-planning GA. ultra-careful class holding staff meetings rooms via Zoom. teachers literally getting within 20 feet other. Why? entire pre-planning dedicated understanding online platforms soon germ-factories come teacher tests positive, 100% sure entire system going shut go virtual.

The big problem kids able stay home parents work. teachers torn kids absolutely screwed nothing place help out. lot poorer kids minorities who's parents work dusk till dawn support system. Without something place kids going educated, period.

This Karen's want go yoga want kids interrupting downward dog. kids eat meals school, get clothes teachers, etc. Schools educate, literally keep children living breathing.

It's terrible fucking situation. It‚Äôs starting happen, recently got 1099 doctor selling cases could write CNBC.  ""People dying covid bad banks Wall Street"" No, really isn't, confusing issue along infection rates.  Easy way show absolutely wrong comparing Florida, Utah, Hawaii. nearly urbanization rate, yet Florida arguably worst case infection. tired proof, same. 

Oops. Perhaps study math writing. Wtf 10 days? labs live results 24 hours max. mean Trump let 1000+ daily deaths force anything try manipulate November election. 'Merica could possibly go wrong? Mass., NY, NJ 2-3 times mortality Sweden. Guess states control too. Low possibility, think of, kid went school positive, got school. Ah, makes lot sense me. Yes, would support students getting refund extent amenities expected (e.g., gym, library, computer lab) inaccessible. Thanks added insight. horrible. people talking psychological issues rampant.

For many kids, hard associating older family whose worldview faux. mean different /s wait actually start testing again. phases. least part state I'm in. I'm East TN total shitshow; obvious give shit people live, work visit here.

People identity politics. pandemic, make political. south stupid? like allowed speak going back work dangerous conditions. 

The great idea. aaaaaannnnnnnnd they're infected entire point massive amount dumb ppl, yet south gets singled out.

Because far worse region. Four southern governors convince citizens wear masks order save college football. That's desperate things gotten there. presumably south mean take personally. attack you. Well, Prohibition urban side choosing ban shit. done every year seasonal flu - schools close week flu cases get control.

Wow, news I'm mid-30s. actually went find articles see actually true surprising. different grew up. School ever closed multiple FEET snow ground allowed stay home sick vomiting (literally).

""BACK DAY"" tangent aside... close school couple weeks flu. articles saw said days clean school.

With COVID we're talking like 5 months far another 6+ coming. That's huge difference makes two situations really comparable. 

Don't get wrong - agree closing schools right thing do. 

But real-world consequences people deal with, like parents able work economic fallout. one thing expect parents take days kids flu season. another thing expect nearly full year. 

To requires lot external support government businesses, air right stuck congress political bickering. PDF actual memo hospitals/health depts. page 12 instructs state health depts continue reporting testing data CDC whereas hospital data (lots it) reported HHS.

Additionally there's nothing prevents hospitals reporting data state health departments anything preventing state health departments publicly sharing information addition reporting HHs.

Basically nothing changed regard testing data. fact, laboratories previously reporting HHS supposed reporting CDC well theory get even testing data were. Inner cities heavily affected covid, want send back school? resistant getting infected, less lovely develop serious disease. Children ten may less infectious, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt infect families - still likely infect least one family member, spread rest. knows sort consequences virus developing organs.

You said yourself. even know long term effects, even young children. sudden concern inner city schools? okay send back wealthier students? seem forget #1 rule sub: let facts get way virtue signaling blaming others. 

Remember novel virus woke (doesn't target anyone protests right cause) racist time (targets BAME white people). takes average one week get test results back....like use that? almost incubation period/asymptomatic period already.  confirm SE Michigan. small town covid kid go graduation last Sunday waiting test results. Later went 6 grad parties hung football team buddies. team sick everyone surprised. School keeps sending letters...‚Äùwe‚Äôre sorry inform student....‚Äù. kid hasn‚Äôt seen friends since March complains cause playing shopping, play lock home. love money. Greed deadly sin indeed.

Louisiana wonderful job containing outbreak minimizing new infections.
They far, much, much, better shape Texas now, major cities especially.
The Texas governor, hereafter styled ""Wheels"", using Trump party line argument increased testing meaning positives Texas testing much.

I‚Äôve also noticed security evening less wait lot less families coming time, less strollers diaper bags dig through. Holy fuck described family complete detail. man, people sound like total racists, like think black people necessarily ""anti intellectual"" smdh! Oh think number car accidents somehow relatable number people infected may died developed lung scarring, among medical issues? people ones got virus unwitting friend/family etc.

So can‚Äôt decide risk tolerance people, it‚Äôs ok employers? put people situation aren‚Äôt deciding themselves, spouse, children, friends, coworkers, anybody come contact day day basis. don‚Äôt think get car accident unknowingly transmit risk spouse 24 hours later.

2. little evidence people besides COVID *any* use firebreaks dead-end nodes. Attack rates closed oblivious populations much, much higher 20%. jail meat plants approach 100% 40% youth camp infected days.

3. strong (I feel conclusive) evidence SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmitted merely breathing talking, activities anyone anywhere.

There‚Äôs simple test tell whether person reasoning skills process argument adapt change opinion based external factors.

It‚Äôs pretty easy: ask ‚Äòunder conditions would mind changed this?‚Äô

For example, don‚Äôt believe God, God indeed come heavens start performing miracles, would accept God real change mind.

A person fails test, someone would line opinion would changed. Instead, faced strong evidence, would find alternative justifications deny what‚Äôs front them. 

For example, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs God. It‚Äôs kind technology. It‚Äôs camera trick‚Äô. Even God standing front person healing cancer, would prefer believe it‚Äôs kind dream drug. Anything changing hypothesis.

America‚Äôs problem many people fail test. many people trained skeptical media (looking Alex Jones, Fox opinion hosts, Rush Limbaugh etc) question everything doesn‚Äôt fit narrative/argument point unnecessary justifications denial favoured overwhelming scientific proof. 

When accept masks good thing pandemic? 
- scientist world agree are? Nope, president won‚Äôt wear one can‚Äôt necessary. 
- president says important? Nope, he‚Äôs pressured deep state? 
- it‚Äôs shown work countries? That‚Äôs fake news make Trump look bad. 

When believe Covid serious threat? 
 
- 10k people die? Nope, left alarmists sell papers. go away April.
- 100k people die? Nope, it‚Äôs worse flu. need look cases/capita. 
- 150k die? Nope, numbers skewed stop Trump winning re-election. need look cases/deaths.
- 200k die? Nope, that‚Äôs bit EU combined. 
- 300k die? Well, doesn‚Äôt matter - China it, couldn‚Äôt predicted prevented. is. need focus economy, doesn‚Äôt matter many die... cure can‚Äôt worse disease.

There line reality overtakes opinion.

The US really needs get ‚Äòopinion hosts‚Äô air creating system anti-intellectualism dresses critical thinking comes across ‚Äòhaving open mind‚Äô ‚Äòquestioning left wing status quo‚Äô - fact, it‚Äôs creating epidemic denialism facts science, even thousands people die day, even putting children back schools means exposing kids virus day.

Hell, Trump responded ALL, things could've lot better.  true wait everywhere 6-10 days matter many people getting tested felt pretty ripped hands-on horticulture program went all-online. curious many republican pelicans sent kids school there. telling people opening school 1 thing, actually following word different thing. certainly shaming parents, media liberal. Look headline. Widely available rapid testing would helpful!

I wish built testing infrastructure point employees places like schools could get weekly tests. would make huge difference controlling outbreak course worked Uh oh suggests pandemic end point good news allowed subreddit. think say spread school safe classes. fucking shut schools 70k cases there's 5 million they're like open bitches back up. Stupid. great uncle died early April got word last week cause death Covid. 

What blew mind mom found out, said ‚Äúyeah seems like everyone who‚Äôs died since March died Covid‚Äù implying kind conspiracy....the man lived nursing home Boston Covid ravaging places. It‚Äôs fucking conspiracy, it‚Äôs everything shitshow one taking proper precautions early months CDC giving conflicting information regarding mask wearing, etc. 

I feel like I‚Äôm living nightmare everyone life lost fucking mind. got news you, Notably terrible football positive tests sample material? happen? America. Many countries managing fine. understand that. didn‚Äôt add alternatives would help fight loneliness keep people safe brought ignored missed it. understand level, still baffles another. [And there's photo Literally ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù crowd also... best world, makes lowest. Better Obama. really. would slowed down, heavily doubt would able end either. Remember, leader counts, citizens brain-dead, hardly matters. nothing quintessentially American pretending crisis over/not real boring. don‚Äôt know. absolutely agree would done best handle it, might much better position, still would become political issue, anti-masker idiots screaming communism rights would still it.

I keep thinking can‚Äôt sink lower, we‚Äôve got January Biden take office (please God let happen). live Georgia wait ten days test. I'm Atlanta probably higher demand here; kid lives somewhere pretty rural strategy what's happening now. Outbreaks continually spread infected areas lax restrictions. takes one person. also need realize aren‚Äôt gambling lives. infectious- they‚Äôre gambling lives loved ones, neighbors, medical personnel treat inevitably get sick call help. reason media agaisnt this.

Do source this? Every thing I've ever seen regarding states opposite. within year, definitely, reinfections? One two anecdotal stories nurses count. Charge Light Brigade chance remove him, republicans said no.

It's trump point, entire republican party. would antibodies help? literally purpose strengthen even enable immune response specific infec would highly recommend flying.

If fly need N95 preferably, KN95. would definitely fly surgical again... to. fly cloth mask also putting others risk.

Wear eye protection. clear science glasses construction safety glasses fine.

Do touch face mask much possible. Frequently use hand sanitizer.

Sanitize seat area yourself.

Wear gloves boarding deplaning switch gloves arrive next area. going piss people mightily, BUT, maybe administrators, pols families asked teacher's opinions matter?  stopped state ran testing. Private labs, doctors could still perform tests. ""So said people, ‚ÄòSlow testing down, please.‚Äô"" -- Donald John Trump work. stay group meet new people. reduced testing closed public run drive sites... could still get tested facilities though. I'm sure adds backup testing, residents gone weather either. We‚Äôve test twice, negative thankfully. Went Thursday, results Monday, times. 

Seems depend location. never wait tests, drove done less 5 minutes total. Countries socialized medicine tend able mobilize better insisting higher overall quality care expense conveniences. win some, lose some. Overall, COVID deaths US manifestation reality people largely please (personal liberty), net positive. wanting get COVID free stay away people might it, too. Even MLB week employees ""kids get sick"" think know better Fauci whether vaccine realistic chance coming year? surprising. think understand ""irony"" means.

Of course I'm immune confirmation bias.

But case, I've actually done research support claim facts sources. say same, read headline maybe skim article run narrative made feel good?

**Fact**: HHS controls *hospital reporting data* 
**Sources**:

* 
* Testing, case reporting, mortality data never came CDC continues reported directly state health departments 
**Sources**:

* (""All data comes state territory public health authorities official statements state officials."") 
* links complete list sources country, state, territory freely available GitHub I'm sure point trying make negate fact severe health crisis car serious pneumonia flu. mortality rate *way* higher mortality rate flu. Hospitals across country nearing, at, capacity. Stories like serve reminder **people dying**.

Just health officials taking seriously mean entire population is. *know* people taking seriously interact public every single day living state one worst outbreaks. putting harm's way every single day go work people taking seriously. People selfish uninformed. Anti-maskers definitely taking seriously; were, angry asked help reduce spread disease. schools skewing fall students go home thanksgiving remember needed refrigerator really nasty summer flus every year! R.... Right guys?! America! We're smart better everyone else, that's come two options! Luckily one options give up! Go America! gets bad strategies are. local school ""cohorts"" limit exposure staff / teachers / admin work every day. much much simpler reason this: COVID stay surfaces like first feared. efforts taken scrub things actually anything useful give people false sense security.

Which means we'll never get it. People trying tell you, right Weird. original comment, seemed suggest rapid tests counted.

You made false assumption. There's reason ask /u/austrianbst_09's opinion, summarized article, used **in opinion** describe **the officials referring accuracy PCR.** 

So clearly, saying: ""**you (austrianbst_09) seemed suggest**"" mistake part. 

**The 'officials' seemed suggest.**

Your post come across attack, comes across understand what's going on, people try explain, double ""I asking austrianbst_09's opinion.""

We **know**. We're telling asking opinion austrianbst_09, ""seem suggest"" relevant. lol dont every headline thread exaggerated lie since march also many places tried lift restrictions impose partial lockdowns number new cases soared.

However agree hindsight, short, strict lockdown least Stockholm back start pandemic would likely saved lives.  right. got tested last week explained turnaround time depends many tests submitted say. said early morning test often yields day results. think people modeling behavior politicians test positive go around people. ok behave way lack common sense, mimicking behavior. 

That said, obviously stupidity problem top bottom. cousin 5 years shell herself. sad. good thing children go quarantine private homes, alone. is. support this.

Considering high population density, makes sense reason already built immunity. couple million protesting protests kill virus. ""Runaway alarmism"". Ha! Nice one. friend (I guess could say ex-friend) justify trip Palm Springs ""didn't want contribute mass hysteria"". 

It's excuse people want inconvenienced right thing. There's mass hysteria runaway alarmism. is, objective truth, 150,000 unnecessary deaths. 

People trivialize lack empathy, also unpatriotic.  Reduction commute hours equating sleep great me. assume end multiple factors factored in. 28 days lockdown people pretty good idea exposed continue lock not. That's assuming people within 28 days able get tested results come back within time, even without confirmation everyone locked person becomes sick assumption others house they'd risking health others go out. We're trying eliminate virus, get numbers low enough contract tracing work isolate specific areas rising cases Yep. schools crappy HVAC, windows windows don‚Äôt open.

I'm staring receipt right front me. Unfortunately say ""coronavirus"" anywhere it, cost 880 yen out-of-pocket, self-paying 30% insurance paying 70%, flu swab, basically.

The whole process took 1 hour:

Step 1) Call hospital tell think COVID would like test.

Step 2) Hospital tells them. tell call prefectural COVID hotline let determine whether ""have suspicion of"" covid. give phone number.

Step 3) Call prefectural COVID hotline. Tell details case. tell indeed ""have suspicion of"" covid, cleared get test. ask they're going tell hospital issue proof, say, no, job tell hospital word good enough.

Step 4) Call hospital again. Tell I'm guy 5 minutes ago asking covid test. Tell prefectural COVID hotline cleared getting test. Schedule appointment 30 minutes later. instruct enter hospital, instead give name number attending physician, instruct call near hospital.

Step 5) Show outside parking lot hospital. Wait precisely 3 minutes prior scheduled appointment. Call attending physician. Tell I'm foreign guy wearing sunglasses aloha shirt facemask (I chose attire intentionally would stand spotted easily physician).

Step 6) instructs little side-unit hospital sectioned rest hospital, open air outside allow air flow easily, special giant gate opens towards parking lot. physician informs watch heat fatigue stay shade goes open gate. wait outside gate 5~10 minutes go around open up. get nervous every time somebody walks me, happened 3-4 times.

Step 7) go inside, nurse pulls cheap outside-chair sit on, instruct fill questionnaire case. nice chat nurse doctor. note that, aside sudden onset complete lack taste smell day 3 particularly strange cold bizarre changing symptoms, feel otherwise fine, fever sore throat cough gone away, even felt good enough go jog, fact resting. Nurse asks various questions *very basic* contact tracing (such number family members, anyone know coronavirus, I've Tokyo recently), informs additional questioning topic test comes back positive.

Step 8) Fill disclosure agreement stating hospital share semi-anonymized data case various organizations. (I remember exact details point. 4. National government, local government, something academia, think 1 there.)

Step 9) Doctor sticks fucking swab way fuck nose, getting really way fuck there.

Step 10) Doctor tells I'll get phone call coronavirus phone people 1 day. (I forget exact bureaucracy was)

Step 11) Leave without paying entering hospital proper all.

The whole process took, including setting appointment waiting appointment, 1 hour.

I got test results 24 hours later, informed phone tested negative. went back hospital 3 weeks later routine dental exam, informed still paid ""that examination last month"" pay it, did.

Have nice day, asshole. looking graphs? one sent CA routinely spiking 100 deaths day since April, whereas FL TX ones even close recently.

Cases per day look almost exactly same. end anti-intellectualism?

Like, org group working this? Seems like much world could much better got rid this. good job comparison rest US.
The bar low normally considered bad job good agreeing. There's nothing says agree person tolerate even like. updated since May, but... Poor Canada get see Blue Jay's playing empty stadium Toronto.

All flu.


They must feeling silly now.


/s I‚Äôm aware, think they‚Äôre tragedies, unlike OP scoffed deaths seven youths. 345 million go herd immunity. Incorrect, California got first, likely passenger transferred NY. 

But please keep spreading propaganda. Hey, Playboy Bunny. Playmate Year, give proper credentials son. also eye candy *Singled Out*, game show Chris Hardwick hosted MTV mid-late '90s replaced Carmen Elektra. deal misreporting deaths- saying heart attack instead covid? remember reports early issues testing US propaganda. never thing. particular video welded shut side exits order account went out.

Almost everything read China media either state (White House) CIA propaganda. question first place? 2 weeks long enough, 59 percent high enough. 
Too many would ignore order even police state like US enough cops enforce order.  data doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs novel virus hasn‚Äôt studied enough answer first question. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs health lottery send kids back school. 
It‚Äôs hard say many kids pre-existing health conditions. underlying health conditions kids detected regular well checkups, know many kids don‚Äôt get regularly all. wait till vaccines come out.  Autism mainstream again.  Americans die reason. California fewer cases fewer deaths per capita national average.  dont understand viruses. probably understand term asymptotic either. Children getting even main problem here, spreading unnoticed real danger. Anti-intellectualism.... purposefully uncunning.... Lack whitted...

I love drunk... Perhaps little much... rest time I'd hope offer could possibly achieve... They're going get infected bring home. they'll infect parents critical cases. like isolate school going kids families. Sadly true, never be. point evangelicals figure they‚Äôve manipulated. Lowest rung pole loses again. say ""2018"" bottom video? Bro think quite read understood last comment. We've seeing high new cases three states CA, TX FL. hitting like 8-12k depending day. Today 5k. Yes still bad yes, still worse many months ago like ALREADY SAID, least trending last days. really thought gonna hit 20k FL. honestly still might, trending downwards new cases covid bug

and start closing first FL spots week ago, state mandate later week. New case counts drop 40% partner, especially large sample population positivity rate

If want ignore 40% claim nursing home patients still 32,000 deaths age 65.

Also would mean 33% Covod-19 deaths nursing home patients 65.


The whole kills old people bullshit. way look it. Even 100% 65, nursing home patients. family laws like this, siblings. dunno wife ended side political spectrum, lonely. like, dumbass dad gets it, dies, kid learns something it.

Which one it, bud? Can't both. Virginia never coal mining state, except portions became West Virginia counties bordering said state.

I've read times use smuggle lsd places travel. seems fitting. see shortly - model spot since early April calling peak deaths early August month. It‚Äôs track record good time tell. post worthwhile, I'm pretty sure sarcasm. That‚Äôs interesting idea behind ‚Äúcall Christ come die‚Äù rooted larger biblical precept dying SELF. in, becoming humble, letting go selfishness idolatry becoming like Christ.

Yikes spread Southern part US reflects anti intellectualism, explains higher case fatality ratios northern states? 

NJ, NY, CT case fatality ratio 4x-5x FL.

Northern states can‚Äôt figure keep patients alive? Yikes. Wow. Yes, agree that. heard wear mask long, stick face forever you‚Äôll never able eat again. 

Source: Facebook can‚Äôt wear mask ?  well, maybe az sick dying home. no, az getting better covid couple hours. need sorry please get wrong, absolutely agree called people talking planning might try get away with. think anyone needs legitimize perspective asking thoughts reasonable thing discuss. reasonable given reason think valid choice make. 
Example, kids always plan worst case - try stand high chair whatever. would crazy ask planning something like that. even put idea head? option, present one. Christianity teaches young age think critically read/are told believe it. actually think creates mindset leads systemic ignorance. 
But nothing back opinion :) would too. salute them, seen hell.  Sure, happens also anti-intellectualism. right it‚Äôs south I'm waiting day WW2 movie comes everyone watches agrees, ""Okay, guess that's it. We've finally covered every angle WW2 possibly covered. possible thing WW2 needs portrayed artistically ever again. We're done now. Let's pack up, time go home.""

I actually find WW2 stuff fascinating true perhaps overrepresented historical media. country seems reached least level herd immunity actually lower case rate America. 

80K/10M 0.8%. [Even optimistic (authored mathematicians, epidemiologists) suggest 43% lower bound herd immunity (compared 60% base case). 0.8% rounding error comparison. Sweden ""at least level herd immunity"" meaningful sense already ran course New York New Jersey...It's gonna run course lot places there's even chance vaccine. people live areas, what's even point lockdowns social distancing? prolonging inevitable.

[20% NYC COVID-19 that's lot, that's still ways herd immunity, virus hardly ""run course"" there.* point lockdowns social distancing avoid overwhelming hospitals buy time better treatments procedures minimize complications reduce number deaths long-term injuries. Every extra day precious.

\*Edit add: getting halfway (in *best case scenario*) entailed lot needless suffering death NYers, overcrowded hospitals, traumatized medical workers, mortuary service staff, families say goodbye loved ones. suggesting accept even worse version inevitability? Let's use nice, constructive words call people BS. Using insults get far anyone. dumb ones will. smarter ones stick much can. actual simpleton? Maybe don‚Äôt understand English. ‚ÄúVery relevant point infection‚Äù means significant number cases would come point infection. 

The whole point ignorance north much, more, south. It‚Äôs unfair bigoted constantly shit southern states wholly ignorant ‚Äòspreaders‚Äô, acting though northern states virtuous completely devoid blame. It‚Äôs disingenuous, disgusting designed nothing cause division. Going walmart Tennessee people cough ""as joke"" type captain assholes face living small town Tennessee. r/thathappened least desire go somewhere else. religious repub co worker never gone trip outside country view ""Why I?"" stuck-in-the-past ""bet coal mining industries lol"" shithole. 

Pretty sure thinking West Virignia.

Virginia pretty diverse state shitty rural areas also lot nicer cities. thought reddit sub info, shit people follow rules. Death rate much reliable statistic that's still completely ignorant assessment since considers kids transfer anyone else. back sub 5 minutes checking 2 weeks. Time take another break. thought one preacher guy winds god blow away months ago?  understand level, still baffles another.

Yes. Introverts much trouble understanding extroverts extroverts understanding introverts. 

Imagine party, know nobody, people every room, even bathroom, music loud, air filled cigarette smoke, random people keep asking personal questions try get talk yourself, can't leave, every time think party going over, somebody announces party continuing. manage nap hours couch get woken couple making out. keeps going on, days weeks months. 

Then somebody tells leave... get front everybody make speech. 

""Come on, hard, enjoy making speeches front crowd"" people keep telling you. ""Also, leave party, 1% chance die, 10% chance grandmother die. Even die, might become sick, although we're yet sure bad permanent damage might be."" 

And increasing numbers introverts either leaving party demanding DJ lower volume open windows let smoke out, much outrage party goers. 

Anyway, that's lockdown feels like extroverts. lot people losing freaking minds continued lack human contact, finding substitutes entirely unsatisfactory, contemplating risking death get human contact. got tested 2 weeks ago (Texas) . Took 4 days get results. worked bunch mad lads? possible whilst people tested antibodies virus, longer show antibodies, could still mean body learnt deal virus catch again? 

That‚Äôs worst sentence hope makes sense. state (SC, know reputation say this) free testing sites often crowded backlogged primary care physician good insurance get immediate appointment test results within 48 hours. 

Capitalism work! Seconded ""AmEriCa rUn LiKe BuSiNeSs."" Hear Karens screams Perfect Peggy. Oh, Mickey! also exclude really cannot wear mask medical reasons? legal? One could say stockpiling warehouse full ammonium nitrate...

ATT made harder municipalities install broadband regulate internet utility. yes feel somewhat justified blaming people support politicians enable them.

As whether think school. Honestly, yes. think really need start accepting fact year school, even happens somehow, going terribly effective. may declare loss, least grade school, everyone repeat they're behind year. unreasonable? like plane thats going crash. land water passengers chance dying? crash outlet mall Black Friday? really difficult unreasonable come conclusion. homelessness dangerous. Catching covid dangerous. Spreading dangerous. permanently disabled, dying, happen kids spouse, family member. much dangerous. feel like I'm repeating still getting it. choice make? No, course not. yet, to. terms least amount harm self society (that claim I'm making) choice clear. Also, may case many Americans, many others want schools open political statement. That's im talking Poverty key competent racism.

Racism locks minorities (both small ways big) better jobs, housing, schools. also makes constant struggle create generational wealth many white Americans take granted (note: generational wealth mean rich).

On white side, almost crazy lengths certain poor whites go try keep system place socially 'better' someone even detriment. They'd rather eat dirt long someone else eating worse dirt. I've seen people vote fight welfare aid would greatly improve situations black people get it. insane. child infect parents even child shows symptoms all. scary disease that's run amok. like Vietnam war, got expensive we're pretending over. Testing sparse February March NorthEast didn‚Äôt even test dead bodies obviously COVID. Antibodies showed every tested case 10 untested cases NYC

Florida probably 5:1 right now, might getting benefit better treatment hopefully better job protecting nursing homes. Hence lower CFR

IFR somewhere .5 .8 according latest studies, always use estimate cases never think happen does. feel lawsuits piling up. really think entire world conspired faked disease trick Americans? Case detection could dropping lots people see value seeking testing.

Especially recent news reports delays getting results, many people may feel upsides getting test diminished.

Asymptomatic infected parties historically sought many tests. goes unpleasant test procedure they're feeling well unless specific individualized concerns? many. üòÇ 1970s, latchkey kid age 6. also left home alone sisters summer break. mom told it‚Äôs law (maybe law then, too. But, like wrote, 70s). doesnt disprove anything said way. even highlighted thinking makes sense. Remember People circles groups (which includes unions) anti wealth disparity? No?

This getting ridiculous.

No? prove connected said. Please... explain ""group"" series connected humans... 

Even wealth disparity thrown mix although unrelated still illustrates concept connectivity. 
 Literally strawman here. doesnt even make sense.

That sir called cognitive dissonance part... keep repeating notion lack connectivity... telling repetition false notion repetition programming personally disseminate personal life. believe true spread notion... despite anecdotal evidence actually supplied way Union example.

Which leads to..
 going ""no you"" evidence contrary.

Please... evidence actually provide ""I told so."" 

You pretty good projection thing. 

My entire comments connectivity.... spelled over. fit agenda I'm troll LMAO. 

I said: connected

You said: (under thumb /cant change situation /income disparity/yadayada)

I said: yes are, union one example connection

You said : Wahhh calling anti union ( projection words mouth)

Even calling troll projection point. I‚Äôm Arizona, west Phx. It‚Äôs 60/40 city. many ‚Äúmy freedoms‚Äù ‚Äúopen gym‚Äù people don‚Äôt care wear mask. It‚Äôs üí© show. lot waves that. example feel little better/more positive now? July struggled everyday things. feel like whole thing turned life upside end sight. 

Anyway. also can't stand lately people say things along lines ""this on"" ""life never go back."" Like people think us working remotely good. never intended home also serve office. course there's global emergency yeah adaptable now. god forbid look forward time house interacting humans. feels like alternate reality. \*Rant over\*  ...Fuck. red blooded American going band together blame actual people caused pandemic issue, themselves. Hahha surprise narrative? really think horde people hoping bad news instead truth? Get em. Tuition already bullshit going school decade ago Second grader taking one team! begins. ‚Äúwe‚Äù specifically mean USA. next step would‚Äôve wide availability rapid tests (which currently exist, many infected people therefore enough rapid tests). Rapid tests used quick results, makes contact tracing possible. Contact tracing means small percentage people quarantine given time. Spread could slowed everyone wearing masks public.

The idea ‚Äúdoing right‚Äù means people get sick 1.) find quickly 2.) stay fuck home everyone else thing. 

I mean, everyone‚Äôs thing now, could thousand deaths relatively low infection rate instead 160,000 deaths strong chance meeting someone every single time go out. depends location. got test results 24 hours (tested afternoon, results inbox woke next day)

I hunch places academic medical centers and/or Research focused universities probably able ramp testing quicker.

A doc told places developed tests extent may AMCs helps.

Places know univeristy hospital another academic medical center testing much quicker turn around rates.

Mine done AMC, know people got testing done Indiana IU there's quick too.  ""Lord, give strength accept things could change grace blame others things can't."" it‚Äôs going get higher Trump sends everyone back school... recent this? flew Southwest past Sunday getting flight attendant told us turn call button would know rows wipe down. one last people two employees wiping rows marked 6800 tests positive rate 25%.  yes, closing restaurants, bars gyms certainly helped. Hey, good Nashville. We're hearing enough stories places things right.  Getting test Alberta 6+ days, lucky enough get one.

By way, also spread NY places millions fucking people states came NY Jan April. wife, BC education, says it‚Äôs like 3-4 days here. may changed.

Edit: sure downvotes least cops enforcing there, unlike places Cali People start this... bear shit woods? \*Shocker\* could panic single case child that's likely mild. mental health impacts missing school probably lower life expectancy erode fabric society long run.

Also noting month late winter them, case anyone still trying make sense possible seasonality virus. Coronaviruses tend peak northern hemisphere January. How... matter? spread it. I've personally hired someone told tested positive. switched phone interview pretty important position. honest. says main ingredient Ethyl alcohol drop plate burn blue dimly lit room hard see. burns yellow Ethyl alcohol. Note isopropyl alcohol also burns yellow can't tell that. low alcohol content may burn. Gaiters definitely convenient masks; Like surgical home made cloth masks reduce spreading disease prevent exposed it. So, they're best anybody socially distant also wearing mask.

Gaiter material tends single layer fold double layer; intrinsically, filter much, wearer still protected increased humidity within mask. Usually start August get May. Another evil person? America going nation wide cage match end year.  

My escape plan always Canada can‚Äôt even go anymore.   sucks feel like need cut off

You do. Yes. willingness make kids sick damn game astounding. I'm disgusted us (Americans) day.

I work school basically covid symptoms winter long bc constant school germs allergies whatever. 

When stay home? link sent me:

Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations flat. ICU beds COVID patients went 1%. (Overall ICU bed usage stayed 83%). Ventilators use COVID went 2%. Intubations Respiratory Distress stayed triple digits (65).

I can‚Äôt see shows hospitalizations ‚Äútanking‚Äù. And, it‚Äôs clear aren‚Äôt seeing information light, reply must, I‚Äôm done. Good day. kids go school long enough exposed worst worlds‚Äîimmediate shut means parents stuck home one enough child care. spreads 2-3 days kids together bring home. Schools country open regular schedule, 3 cases appear positive one school closes down. Send prayers. think already does. It‚Äôs sad. guarantee condition worsen mid-flight?

just add sick doctor every flight. problem solved. went 70k daily 49k repeated days 50s pretty obvious.

As schools open Trump finally tells supporters ""be patriot wear mask"" reduced testing take credit low #s August. dangerous would take Russian vaccine, stands today? understand teachers nationally strike. would. ""It is"" NYC here. i'm glad see tri-state well now. NYC, see tons people gathering outside bars restaurants social distancing, makes bit worried. young(er) people suppose. older people part always masked around here, good. Yes... is... lot schools really share teachers either. Especially year 1-6.

""Sure, let's throw sick w/ elderly"" blaming president?? swear, people frequent r/politics intelligence fucking 5 year olds. think they're sooooo smart thought lol

You're type person run around tell supporters called hoax 100% incorrect, morons look up, believe you, kill people, say ""See, ornge man killed people"" spread false info along. damn stupid, incomprehensible.

This attention get though proven mentally capable grasping simple logic axe grind. That's you, me. Best luck hold breath understand. I'd rather get trouble b/c people (not you) capable great discussion here. Look what‚Äôs already happening daycares. Someone tests positive, close down...at beginning. kids get sick, they‚Äôre told stay home longer fever, still come back couple days later. point fatigue sets one care sick infectious kids still going school. Oh please don‚Äôt even suggest it. would surprised sort second civil war uprisings comparable violence. cannot sustain type divide. need USR Courier HST/Dual Speed 16.8K. school screening everyone must get tested, negative results first? You‚Äôre forgetting key component:

Many people discouraged seems like world fucked matter what. wearing mask gas station nothing I‚Äôm one it. 

I‚Äôll preface saying I‚Äôm still taking precautions (even though travel work). fuck, I‚Äôm tired. don‚Äôt energy try convince people give fuck, believe real world exists, whatever. emotional well-being shot shit. body weak sitting around, barely sleep stress, yo-yo eating &lt;500 calories day. I‚Äôm angry scared moment wake well I‚Äôm asleep.

I wear mask don‚Äôt leave except food work. relationship friends strained sparse.

Hope prerequisite action... fuck... helps.

But what‚Äôs point everyone else seems intent fucking killing anyway? haven‚Äôt started yet school (private school Chicago Suburbs) graduating seniors families test positive know someone positive 2/3 principals family recently tested positive. bluntly stated know staff students test positive know can‚Äôt always keep social distancing. way shut state (Illinois) shuts us down. need job opportunity us choose leave absence passed. I‚Äôm praying stay healthy keep guidelines best can. went back university year. great 15 year run fine dining, refuse covid 19 punching bag, even 50$/hr usually made. Gonna finish bs year, apply med school fall. Thank god almost free University Canada. Somewhere between, depends kind test. get point brought immigrants barely highschool education turn way. Despite fact much family little obtuse brainwashed times. Like said still fault. can't really fix problem upstream either. regulated media? much choice without government support. Wearing masks around necks, well, customer always right. /s live Alabama, exactly say we're ""struggling"" virus. article seems like clickbait me. Hospitalizations else new. They're still nowhere near overwhelmed.

Life seems pretty normal numbers continuing decrease. We've statewide mask order weeks I'd imagine effects starting show. We've 1,000 new cases two days now.  pay rapid testing. Costs around $75 area governors walking tight rope far aggressively approach virus. Results lit mixed messaging lack unity approach many things including testing. implies virus overblown. 

More kids died nut allergies year COVID lunch time still thing. 

Im saying they're acceptable losses. I'm saying fear irrational. point even public-facing scientists admitting 70% herd immunity thresholds based oversimplification aren‚Äôt accurate.

This *not* mean lift restrictions yeet straight toward real threshold, would still result many deaths knows long-term illnesses. stop quoting it. Maybe testing slows down, mean virus going away.

""Cases continue decline!"" scream headlines, White House's reelection campaign. Stop trying make sense don‚Äôt care literally don‚Äôt care children die. should‚Äôve realized Sandy Hook. don‚Äôt care children die don‚Äôt care anyone dies Whew, dodged bullet They‚Äôre going shut anything going forward. mask mandates such. Schools opening except hot zone counties pushed back September. be. protect much difficult decisions coming everyone. totally disagreeing overall post, every worker economy die take precautions. basing argument false pretense.

And 150k tax revenue economic activity smaller drop bucket compared total losses US economy tax revenue that's brought quarantine overall mishandling situation. 

Again, taking stand done. pointing two counter arguments. kids get sick moment contract virus? mean, plausible kid virus prior going attending school?? even read article? many us okay that, sure. sad. let virus expected stop it. stopping spread speed. hit her, not! There's incubation period testing too. Kid infected school Plus fact health care workers signed job knowing would risk factors involved, entire industry designed try reduce factors much possible (hospital-grade masks, gloves, face shields, surgical gowns, sterilization processes, training, etc). Teachers never signed deal pandemic. get wide range quality/quantity PPE. real sterilization process (there's time budget it), training limited one-hour video using PPE.

Not mention that, health care workers see lot people throughout day, unlikely they're seeing hundreds thousands people average teacher (many willingly spite PPE/safety factors that's kids work). That‚Äôs local district did. started saying would give option remote in-person, everyone choose. couple weeks ago reversed course went 100% remote. Painful though may be, seems like way now. live Paulding County Georgia, picture kids crowded hallway masks going around originated from. K PreK virtual/homeschooling stupid place is. people rip masks soon make past greeter Walmart. school district sent email photo saying photo taken context. county facebook page discussion photo 99% comments believe masks/us use sheep/TRUMP 2020/if like keep kids home, rest us gonna live lives trapped fake virus. kids cant online learning without parent sitting them. parents available whole time class. non verbal kids kids special needs unable so. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre correct. It‚Äôs likely immunity pressure slowing rate transmission. TX FL AZ approaching 14-18% seroprevalence range (as result disastrous pandemic response). less potential vectors infection right now. better strategy reopen everything cross fingers many people croak appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* study consisted short survey

So, height-biased start? I'm guessing take another two years sort /s maybe hundred like masks. Ah, see now. Yep, matter much show one person getting sick could infect potentially kill tens even hundreds people, wanna hear it. Well, least pretty much everyone live taking pretty seriously too.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Honest question, actually important work must still travel? Could meetings done Zoom web programs? management sees subpar way business must meet person? BS life science lab experience, consider joining COVID surge team state‚Äôs public health lab.

Nights, weekends, etc need people jump perform tests. heard large groups politicizing mask wearing country?  lot people still believe kids spread die it. parents' rationale- ""I think benefits far outweigh risks"". words, making sure kids place socialize get supposedly better education person important preventing death. Psychopaths.... Chattanooga mayor issued mask mandate chief police hours later made statement enforce write tickets it. can't win state. then? Tear city build new one?

What people do? Leave?

You need level understanding patience individual person solve problems plague community plague country. I'm sure matters - every town, city, county, state country built racism slavery.

I'm sorry hate people around so. Hate solve ignorance. Perhaps better plan though. thinking moving year COVID hit, still unsure. Even northeast cops wearing masks. got harassed day CT, 1 6 cops mask on. I'm still can't quite believe returned mace brass knuckles let go.

I wish I'd thought comeback ""If one reported anything missing would even identify stolen property?"" demanded know want let check bag stolen shit, rather 5 minutes later. Come Canada Water wet. go work 1,057. forecast moved nearly exactly 1,000 ceiling around 1,060 per covid19-projections.com. Seems ceiling - pretty good forecast couple weeks ago.

Although I‚Äôm doubts we‚Äôll even hit average 2k per day. Hospitalizations started slowing many places weeks ago. may hopefully soon see death peak decline afterwards. yeah man move entire life somewhere else. easy high school sports make money school unless notable area. high school makes nothing sports actually costs school money still currently planning fall sports (although imagine time comes cancel postpone football) denial, valid argument.. nothing.

üëª You‚Äôre right. NYC handled perfect care voided comparison. Bro, ‚Äúleftists cities‚Äù already hot spots. they‚Äôre least listening scientists unlike anti-intellectual south. claim asylum Canada want. trying say New York reputation anti-intellectualism? Anti-intellectualism A. Cuomo‚Äôs response COVID19. COVID tent, Navy hospital ship. Yet sent COVID positive patients nursing homes. 

The state NY deaths entire country Italy. also deaths entire country India 1.3 billion population country. 

At point. call is.  No, three years social distancing wearing masks. vaccine eventually. thought south usa bad unbearably hot humid, want stay indoors ac circulated air. could one reason see swing cases late winter summer here. Canada, hate see may happen -10 days. Try backyard...? Lol... said north dense that‚Äôs way insinuates south somehow worse isn‚Äôt dense. Don‚Äôt act dumb don‚Äôt good argument. i've cutting hair 40 years...when younger, came realization cut hair, could use haircut money buy weed instead.

i've gotten pretty good it. even back.

and- i've found generally better wall-mounted mirror(well, anyway) medicine cabinet three-part mirror, two side panels doors open out, helps lot.  I‚Äôm noticing people complaining openly less, talk vaccine ending more.

Once vaccine people get vaccinated, shot hell behavior continues. 2-3 years, scientifically smart, dreaming, outside maybe countries Asia, people vaccinated, masks gone offensive, Black n Tan Guinness drinks.

Wanna piss full Irish bar? Order car bomb. bad idea. point, data, stories verified, everything year...anyone isn‚Äôt taking seriously malicious selfish shit stain. life often get deserve although I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs sad loved ones sad me, doesn‚Äôt bring joy, sports like tennis, golf, cross country low risk transmission within sport themselves.

Lol Nope, I‚Äôm free children go school mask free, cause get little tired wearing mask.... eh? Whatever Bro OK whatever. clearly agenda. likely leftist politics, that's good bro. u say next hotspot leftist city? 

I hope open eyes see clearly later on. hope nobody family gets Coronavirus ""anti-intellectual""  Wearing cloth mask least someone do. Compared everything someone do, volunteering, donating blood, giving money, literally least someone do. get people fall head heels love romantisized versions history become obsessed eras (Civil War WW2 stand out) ton money media attention focuses gives way much attention many interesting things entire history every part world.

Don't get wrong, eras interesting. much media focused every aspect WW2 especially seems like overkill. 

Very find interested history economics, political structures, culture technology. There's even ton aspects WW2 interesting outside battles technology, often something barely touched. many aspects history get WW2 Color 50th time. Anti-vax groups span political parties teaming anti-maskers times 6 weeks ease lock provided mask wearing social distancing (beyond 6 feet) plus awareness aerosol transfer confined spaces. start contact tracing suppression hot spots.

No, passes buck easily. risks large state high population, shit ton metropolitan areas, ranked first tourism, first stop crossing Pacific. shout testing sites....duh....they think stupid,the deaths still high nonsense. reckless, irresponsible things reckless irresponsible even ends ok. responsible things responsible even ends bad. interesting attribute ""good job"" NYC eventually achieved part city structure, obviously governor able step make important decisions needed turn things around. Would make sense. Absolutely fucking shot hell happens basically anywhere, theory makes sense Hey, Louisiana's mask mandate weeks now! bit like smartest kid dumbest class though. Poor JBE, he's really fighting dumb fucks state. tested July 21st NY still results (pro tip, avoid CVS tests possible). way bigger scandal rn. Gov‚Äôt should‚Äôve made PCR machines making ventilators. citation? everything power lessen blow.

You think so? think sending COVID patients back nursing homes part that? Cuomo put rug people called way absolve (in)actions states skyrocketing cases &amp; deaths

I say deaths significantly passed NY 

Because NY killed population susceptible. 

NY, NJ, CN 40% total deaths. deaths even throughout demographics. elderly people preexisting conditions high number cases low deaths good thing economic impact worse COVID many many people.  always loved quote. Good choice. reach 100k daily officially first. Sigh. hospitals become overwhelmed, COVID patients dying. anyone hospital ill reason. enough people supplies save everyone heart attack beds, think happen? blood clot, car accident etc. anyone love (hopefully not) get seriously injured hospital overloaded covid patients, might well fucked. 

It's COVID kills people. resource use going well.  Corporations spend 5 decades billions dollars turning citizens consumers, result. Everyone would go give go back normal way then. No....

It shows places using *heavy air conditioning*, result people confined spaces. would 2nd degree murder. 
1st intentionally trying kill specific person. 
2nd degree compasses acts demonstrate extreme indifference human life. Thank god school district isn‚Äôt stupid ‚ÄúMy alternate facts good fake news media inspired facts.‚Äù come Mississippi town definitely nerdy type (reading, video games, etc.) never experience, know many people did. might bad experience wouldn‚Äôt use blanket statement entire South.

-Carl Sagan- absolve anything, Republicans can't help lash lies know ground stand on. They'd literally rather die COVID admit wrong voting Trump. want point say that? nobody think closing schools detrimental virus itself? Kids get virus, statistically die it. recent child death 6 year old triple organ transplant compromised immune system. Normal kids need learn, bigger problem. Maybe look masks tie around head neck? find comfortable ear loop ones safer neck gaiter (better material several layers) can, course, put reasonable restrictions things. (Like mask mandates...

Yes, demand masks protests, ban them. KKK marches. complete waste, supposed replace hundreds aircraft across multiple countries. per aircraft cost still lower existing aircraft, problem one-size-fits-all approach led lot cost overruns delays. really hope so. heard district high school look yet. whole thing shit show elementary schools 

You want 15 kids class? means school need almost double teachers. get teachers, realize got place hold extra classes. Ok, gotta rent office space something. kids get sent new site? money involved. whole string problems solve one thing. Coping mechanism likely. deal something magnitude world literally shut hard lot people, easier believe big deal carry normal face reality whole world changed  dumb bureaucracy banana republic playing politics we're tribal can't get corners stop it.

Gravity works. Always. Covid-19 works always. like flatten curve won. stays flat keep made flat. go back eating 3000 calories day getting shape going get fat again.

But lot people power tell people power needed keep schools closed. teachers students put risk would get sick make clear via sacrifice schools needed closed. Wow. Someone read article commenting. agree you. previous system ideal either. hybrid potential improvement. Literally drawing directly source provided, says flu cause sinusitis difficulty breathing, source already directly responds silly obviously false claim suggesting CDC wrong listing specific symptom, response quoted verbatim: "" ""These lists inclusive"" I've heard this, surgeries/treatments delayed people opting seek medical assistance given current circumstances, awful. gonna something we'll feeling repercussions years come I'd say. dude, wtf wrong work. Nothing essential fly every week pandemic joke, really think people insisted shirking personal responsibilities limiting spread nearly big deal now. are.  2022 Well... Something like that, yes.

I mean there's enough cases contagion traced back specific setting. √Ånd there's enough flying.. infections airplanes happening, stretch least one traced back there. raising children properly difficult undersupported society

Parents getting fucked people society. Bound happen job needs limit amount people time. mind boggling can't put little bit effort, delegate effort. Amazing Like positive legacy. teach? Meh, it‚Äôs media person, thankfully charge decisions. kids get mild covid cases, they'll stop spreading least months longer (we know yet). keep grandma away grandkids couple weeks, feel safe months kids permanent developmental delays (actually, probably already least it'll less) Interesting, thanks insight providing source claim lol. glad cancelled trip summer. Insert shocked pikachu face meme* making noises Florida going go back testing people active symptoms. Probably great way drop numbers, lousy way control spread. get Yale law degree free? I‚Äôm lucky school district (in Oregon) closed 6 weeks hope good one well autofill34 ! think glossed one key benefits. Currently schools overcrowded underfunded. E-learning ability make high quality instruction available everyone. matter small town 20 people total crowded inner city 35 students per class. everyone get access classes taught great instructors almost topic. get bad cold even flu, spiral downwards quickly. I‚Äôm type 1 diabetic causes sugar levels rise start vomiting dehydration I‚Äôm icu days. can‚Äôt imagine covid me. saw? Lol. Well considering phase 3 data trials, saw nothing relevance. Flu season actually truly inflated. actual flu season deaths around 4,000-15,000. flu number based model. can't tie flu number actual death certificates names. COVID. we're winning we're winning much we're tired 

/s asshat politicians want open schools don‚Äôt plan there‚Äôs outbreak. They‚Äôre psychopaths. feel bad friend, schools shuoldn't open, are, need daily testing work. worked hair salon, parent drop-off child teeming lice thought job rid it. Bringing lice hair salon catastrophic, least one dies it. 

Opening schools right now? Holy fucking shit, negligence.  probably unpopular, unproductive year learning young children going much bigger impact children getting sick. thing going completely fuck development tens millions children.

The choices good think making kids go school lead best outcome one could expect pandemic. I'll dial local daycare definitely business right see rates child may exposed school supposed isolating would be...

I get saying. think situation involves little bit critical thinking ""just we've doing.""

The point highly likely happening frequently enough take large toll average persons ability maintain job take time occurrence. addition, concern continued transmission spreading virus going difficult normal find retain childcare typical way. totally wrong. Data clearly said students lower death rate seasonal flu, course kids would want go back school believe science. science denier believe conspiracy theory schools reopen, thankfully kids parents way smarter you. Also slavery society thing, right wrong determined majority belief, mass majority believes wrong wrong. Total opposite Canada. native communities shut borders right away put check points. Kept movement way down. really story federal government income support allowed many people country stay home perhaps. figure part teams fake accounts try messages first within different accounts amassed different demographics. ever one gets results want pushed president bullshit front nation already shopped around, takes even bullshit. He's wrong. covid-19 pandemic emergency.

I, personally, like online courses. Texas needs better teachers. ltaught two states better benefits Texas. think teachers work 60% professionals make? problem comes courses designed online. case (hospitality), courses clearly inferior physical counterpart, courses expressly designed online, even rather shit.

While often cover complex topics spend less time simple things, result better teaching, result better students.

You literally cannot go back classroom make like virus vaccine. Education going hover back forth half-assed in-person approach half-assed distance learning approach can‚Äôt make hard decision. It‚Äôs practically we‚Äôve treated virus itself. half-ass way seriously American way.  Boston public schools spend per student public school district Massachusetts. Agreed. normal kids get sick.

However, normal child home two week long illnesses multiple times school year. kids return, long next positive case shows they're back home again? guess every single death Europe directly leaders, huh? asinine think place like US would able prevent infections matter charge.

And think I'm voting rapist/pedophile November, got another thing coming, sport.

Sooner later become clear everyone herd immunity nearly reached NYC. 

!Remindme 1 month forgot, pretty low steadily descending. June 25th. know virus changing daily, using old articles MONTHS ago proves absolutely nothing. TIL Georgia = entire United States

And talking Trump, democratically elected. Reminds Spring 1944 55 German divisions France. 

What General Dwight D. Eisenhower say? ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù ok case counts start dropping (step 7)? makes sense implement sort shutdown mask order. happened May shutdowns implemented many states, there's second spike cases shutdowns happened lot places. think case counts going magically start decline without implementing real policies. words... believe case count numbers anymore. think two possible reasons this:

A) Hospitals report case counts directly whitehouse instead CDC (I wonder implemented policy?)

B) Testing capacity maxed Herd immunity works Define awhile. days? week? Completely wrong. That's pretty much pessimistic scenario possible. numbers trusted I'll tell they've hiding it. feds changed guidelines get tested since HHS took over. immediately shut federal test sites put stop free testing, made much difficult get test unless show physical symptoms. Another good example HHS took states like Utah 7,000 tests day getting around 700-800 new cases daily. run 2-4k tests day get 300-400 new cases day claim numbers going down. states like Florida, upwards 100k tests day getting 10k new cases daily. around 40k tests daily getting still almost 10k new cases day. testing number SIGNIFICANTLY dropped well guidelines even getting tested. Yet new cases drop much considering difference. means transmission clearly awareness down. wait, 3 - 5 days karens saying ""see, everyone fine"" 14 - 21 days everyone going ""The average age hospitalization dropping cases spreading schools reopened pikachu face"" can't go street without insta triggered 4 people 10 showing nose low IQ Trump DeVos adamant schools need open. wrong goals lockdown too. buy time prepare things needed contain virus like done West. bunch idiots sabotaged plan primary people pushing next predictable failure. mean got school? No, doesn‚Äôt

Does mean infected anyone else? Also no. tried looking wastewater tests, sounds pretty dubious. didn‚Äôt sequence virus, positive response one tests used today, would actually produce many false positives get it. Unfortunately, far I‚Äôm concerned, cost benefit analysis says it‚Äôs better safe. goes health economics. wouldn‚Äôt leaders weren‚Äôt short sighted economic issues. opened soon penny wise dollar foolish. we‚Äôre trying repeat mistakes. problem quarantine children get sick. Exactly.  many previously healthy kids infect day?  That's entire point. voted since 2004 politics, sides, become cults. fact think president impact live lives proof. Florida hasn‚Äôt skated by. 7500 people died half million people confirmed Covid positive, along 28,000 hospitalizations. there‚Äôs massive economic impact missing half year tourism won‚Äôt show state budget next year. worst disaster Florida ever faced. governor looks Florida thinks ‚ÄúI WANT THAT!‚Äù person voted office. Except contaminated, traveling, especially level requiring airplane. Ahh, can't disagree you. Headline sensationalism dumb works idea spreading information.  approach perspective someone believes, even dark far-flung corner brain, coronavirus hoax.

They always say explicitly. beliefs surface might nuanced. resist mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, reopen schools, keep restaurants bars open, fundamentally believe coronavirus. know narcissist's prayer?

Does school cure covid-19? 

It even cure stupidity ! think point going say ""Whoever experiencing symptoms, stay home"" go it. Case numbers explode, do, cannot see alternative.

Take South Korea example. started large scale testing within 2 weeks first case, government poured lot resources worked closely private entities establish large number isolation wards, screening/testing sites, etc. around country, aggressively contact traced basically outset. allowed prevent peak cases getting high, suppress quickly effectively.

The US hand outright denial severity virus touting unproven cures ignorance basic prevention methods highest levels even time thousands dead hundreds thousands infected. basically fuck way coordinated national response many testing, treatment, prevention measures left state even local governments (we know well that's going), states even individual hospitals left bid open market sometimes even federal government essential medical supplies, much US reopening despite wholly inadequate number tests carried out, total lack contact tracing, infection death numbers really suggest that's good idea (and obviously rocket point). Shit's fucked, would've largely preventable even mildly competent leadership.

But humor you:

Given 23,000 covid deaths NYC assuming low fatality rate 0.65%, total estimated number covid infections NYC would 3,500,000 total, 42% city's population. high enough herd immunity.

Feel free post cherrypicked antibody studies hardest-hit neighborhood city, though. Schools area opening week. Masks ""required wherever feasible"", constant cleaning, staggered eating times, updated air circulation systems. Hoping best, can't help pessimistic future.

Fuck people right? That's terrible. got tested minute clinic got result back two days. Maybe amounts tests sent time swamping local system?  hell matter people!? Thank god almost free University Canada.

Uhmmm 'almost free' University, heard before??? knew, reason taking hard route every junction, id usually say money starting feel almost sinister little action taken  teachers authority so. Admin override--and don't, takes one kid mommy complaining mask make admin backpedal. Literally president U.S. history would've handled better.

And even he's going full herd immunity route, clearly even close that. Using CDC's IFR 0.65%, 60% herd immunity, means 1.28 million Americans die first. 1.13 million Americans need die get guess, Trump says ""it is"" thought process this:

Trump shown Governors must kiss ass get shit on. (seriously - look states get covid aid funding per pop/case...) 

So, Trump says ""schools open"" resist. knowing damned well (or not, cases, probably) wont last. least ""fell line."" That's gonna OOF man city teachers went strike got community members fill in

I sure jumping opportunity now. Herd immunity estimated somewhere 60-80% population

This misleading information. threshold 60-80% estimation outbreaks *which vaccines*.

Some current models suggest COVID-19, every case immunity derived direct infection, threshold around 40%.

On top that, seroprevalence studies showing figures % population infected *severely underestimated*.

*And top that* growing evidence infection common cold may lead T-cell immunity COVID-19, **even seroprevelance studies may underestimate number people immunity**

So pretty dangerous take numbers wall extrapolate across entire population. work much better work setting, truth told. need get defining separation work home get work mentality. cool example recurring problem, wouldn‚Äôt include earlier Republicans modern republicans.

In Houston, daily new hospitalizations ~50% peak, 2-3 weeks changes above. back surge ICU capacity. Current COVID hospital census 65% peak. Things drastically improved here.

The TMC testing data (for tests run facilities 2-48 hour turnaround) reduced numbers tests performed reduced % positive. 

Also Houston, median time death date County report date 21 days. deaths getting reported today inline hospitalization trend. 

I say Texas California, also shut bars, populous states drive lot positive cases population alone. countries eliminated it. Asymptomatic carriers traced eventually people infect. Great come back!

personally, since read Kawasaki disease later severe complications realized know little virus wise let researchers spend time learning going back normal. wealthy colleges this. teachers still get paid every time need quarantine 2 weeks? I'm guessing no. wish able strike Georgia! We‚Äôll get fired do. Disavantage:

It‚Äôs like posting article necessary evil shaming Sweden. real purpose putting misinformation comments. 

I don‚Äôt mind balanced sometimes tough discussion. that. schools closed, parents can‚Äôt go back work.

Do parents work summer? I'm glad taking care yourself, I'm sorry forced make decision. imagine online skull bones zoom initiation rituals?! Well, guess we'll see happens.

I really want get back school teach classroom. miss teachers, online teaching trash.

There seem great way things days. hear lot sound bytes death certificates COVID wrongly credited cause death. lot sound bytes often combined claims hospitals getting money/more money COVID death report. 

To extent claims true? know actual impact alleged claims?  Texas private companies go rapid test. Buddy got one yesterday 15 minutes. anecdotal confirm priors. millions actice, confirmed cases statistically unlikely given school say 1000 students least one two infected students day one. One could imagine many class mates teachers infect first day. Within first week secondary cases start infect another generation. unreasonable expect average school second monday teaching dozens spreaders active. normal time schools open?

True, people unexpected things. Emperor Trump decrees schol must open. N95s KN95s back stock. even find That's viruses work. Even something pathogenic ebola people asymptomatic even covered blood victims bleeding out. places NYC quick turnarounds. Got tested earlier week got results next day. vaccine approved general public use without solid data &amp; stringent FDA approval. 

You believe Trump admin's FDA would approve something politically expedient? Well never know, recovering function 2 years necessarily mean recovering completely. still steals two years life. I'll try lay low there's vaccine, point getting sick help Agreed. beyond unfortunate. yep send planes directly middle atlantic universities around students come back week, I'm going cautious usual. can‚Äôt force quarantine people.

This bit understand... *public health crisis* - well-documented, easily provable... freedom nuts lose shit anyone *date* tell can't go.

In meantime, US suffering kleptocratic government administration financial overreach likes seen - people give fuck.

What happen people see what's right front goddamned faces? Depends State. NE I'm Wed/Thur Labor day Sept. south get May back August. think thinking ridic hot June/July mid august better. Many schools least NE dont' AC, that's July/Aug get mid/late June. still roasting June. school district put AC last year think temps rising year June. what's long term solution hypothetically there's vaccine? Unless tip top strategy learning home work. Also kids going school takes pressure parents finding child care kids. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø already answered question. said know. Maybe go full topiary - could manage holidays!  According sites [heres Australia neck neck US August 4th tests per capita. looked came fairly empty up-to-date positive test rates US Australia many tests actually performed Victoria exclusively date confirm this. testing even close per capita US is. 

This seems wrong dug up. Deaths actually increasing weeks. choose fully remote classmates (zoom/google meet), days week, fully remote asynchronous first quarter.

We went async one since kids good learning like get ahead classwork. think least disruptive option shit hits fan kids go back school. going take outbreak one teacher / student death entire district close again.

I see schools think safely. think prevent covid19 outbreaks can't even prevent lice running school. always thought American kids went back September

Many schools too. I'm school year always first week September - 1st week June. look President Philippines, proud we‚Äôll get first dibs chinese vaccines...smh nephew supposed start 1st grade beginning September, school district sounds like ours, except online option ""it count"" would repeat 1st grade physically go school. world tend work absolutes, you? answer somewhere sending back height pandemic never sending back. Come on. goal posts arent moving. There's one goalpost. Yeah - MIT isn‚Äôt Yale. Meaning, MIT, Caltech, UChicago - high ranking Ivy League provide connections anything like that. high-ranking HARD, produce incredibly smart well-educated graduates, think critically understand subject matter deeply.

Stanford, Harvard, Princeton grads hand - literally don‚Äôt get less Bs classes (grade inflation rampant - would hurt students chance grad school future success), classes undergrad moronic (superficial coverage subject matter far less covered per quarter/semester), socializing important. It‚Äôs getting in, learning. It‚Äôs idiotic.  forgot pedophile Wholeheartedly agree, think there's going least segment long while. folks go way rip people wearing mask befuddles me.

The distancing think always challenge that's harder get people buildings, family gatherings, eventually events occur again. Isn‚Äôt school supposed summer start September Canadian I‚Äôm lost. death isn‚Äôt risk.. even read title post? make flat packs well, require measurably less plastic. Unfortunately consumers vote dollars prefer canisters. hope one casualties realize. Insane. we‚Äôre ones thinking humanely! 

We simply sacrificed almighty economy. genuinely thought lived society values human life stock market. Realizing I‚Äôm wrong making rethink everything. nuts. Get help. Kansas, actually depends school district. state guidelines defined required contact hours, district picks days. district goes M-Th (almost) every Friday off, would started Aug 17 year schedules normal. !remindme 1 day Understaffed overworked ? Yes, form completely legal campaign donations post-political-office consulting lobbying jobs. may immoral unethical, illegal, it'll keep happening. USA says ""you Canadians see Americans stupid. humanity. Enjoy show."" got test results 1 day, instant test available $120 Yeah, lot deaths really need happen. apendix removed april, soon went Er tested covid, swab goes roof brain. Results came back 30 minutes, surprised results came back quick. I've never disappointed Country short lifetime. feel like door door salesman trying educate fellow friends need Trump out. rapid test 10% - 20% false negative rate. think traditional test pretty close range well Tbf kids probably sacrificed. teachers parents ultimately suffer most. Sweden Switzerland ffs. basically failed state.


What's SUPPOSED happen, Europe doing, federal government throwing BALES money individuals states *stay home*. federal govt ability many states don't. GA, instance, one worst nation, *in state constitution* A) income tax capped mere 6% B) run balanced budget (i.e. borrowing you, say massive sales tax income rely on). 
So *don't* system basically paying people stay home, go work. kids? monstrous bind sick nation putting ordinary parents through: send kids school earn enough make rent buy food, somehow find way keep kid physical class supervised enough so.

It's anyone half brain actually expects good outcome. know it'll cause massive death, based revelations Jared Kushner *had comprehensive plan address crisis shelved politically expedient blue-state people die*, that's entire point. That's one many reasons lot southern dictators nothing - why, mostly killing black brown people vote you? big Anti-Vaxxers (?) Movement America? Drinking Kool-Aid population see. Arizona's % positive dropped 27% peak 18% falling, Rt 0.89 means continue fall, person infects &lt;1 person.
Florida's % positive trended last days, personally I'd still call plateau much departure peak around ~19.5% positive yet. Rt also &lt;1, though, indicates see drop.
Texas come peak positives 18% around 14%, last couple days 12%, hopefully continues fall again.. Rt &lt;1 0.94. hopefully indicates continued fall.
Ohio indoor dining since 5/21 done pretty good job, hovering around 4-6% positive months. Nice curve flattening, pretty textbook told handle start. Spread infections longer, slower period overwhelm medical system, etc.
Georgia funky graph due weird one day glitch, recent peak mid-July 16.0% positive, current 7-day rolling average around 12.9%.
I personally hopeful means virus burns population fairly quickly, runs hosts, subsides own. seems despite taking real drastic state-wide measures (such shuttering non-essential businesses entirely) states hit hard (FL, AZ, TX media pointed disastrous states), curve came went own.
It wondering New York, really beat virus much already burned population tough time finding new hosts. Indoor dining open state awhile outside NYC hospitalizations keep dropping.
These states combined Sweden's curve coming going shows promise able return normal soon, given virus seems burn somewhat.
Additionally, US 5-day new case average seems declining well.
Let's hope we're way woods kid spread around others first day. Thank decent person ‚ù§ I'm New York right work I'm leaving tomorrow go back home SoCal. made choice drive rather risk flying stories like continue reinforce decision. Four days road better 5+ hours airports confined small metal tube infected people. I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre really thinking money. rate things going, US could lose 1-3% population next year so. economy recovers that?  

Edit: can‚Äôt find source mobile figure extrapolated current deaths/reported case ratio (4%). got super early chinese new year travels I'm still breath talk long. springing flight, spring N95 P100, practice wearing flight.

The number one risk airborne transmission. 

I think airlines adopted good ventilation practices, forget news article saw that. are, narrative! Good luck learning anything covid brain No, got sarcasm. know. November, despite happened year, going important month lives, possibly human history.

FTFY Georgia requiring masks? Urgent question: boyfriend might go hospital today increasingly severe COVID symptoms. don‚Äôt live together, dog. I‚Äôve heard also carry/transmit COVID. Since also two dogs don‚Äôt want get infected, clue dog go hospital. 

1) truth human-dog/dog-human transmission?

2) recommendations dog, mean time? Even risk low, dog doesn‚Äôt get along great two, taking care 3 large dogs would struggle me.

Any advice would much appreciated. young healthy. recover immune. see problem. day one everybody kid came contact supposed quarantine 2 weeks right? move smoothly schools across country. Easy peasy parents manage, I'm sure. 50,000 people die normally U.S. every week causes, using weird comparison model, 45 Boeing 737s worth people die every single day. freaking deaths? ""they'll get it"" They're denial. think virus real consequences opening up. virus affect many parts body, creating brain fog fatigue one recovered? parents. rest immediate family. teachers. family teachers.  don‚Äôt understand possible. takes 10-14
Days symptoms manifest would infected school first day show positive? already positive. absolutely think cases kids grow type headline isn‚Äôt helping. honest know said 7 days. trending since peak 7/12. always heard get tested presumed positive results say otherwise. getting tested likely exposed already symptoms reason think good go get little brain tickle fun. strange hear taking ten days. I‚Äôm Missouri. one done urgent care return work reopening. 15 minute turn around negative results covid test antibodies test. Well paying 'life experience' surrounding carefully curated students simulate diversity then, yeah probably getting money's worth.  


If paying education, online equal format pass fucking tests need study yourself. People give knowledge, teach yourself, colleges provide competent resources that. Nah view elite untouchable Unless proven vaccine, US bailing random biotech companies? Seems like money could better spent getting people testing masks. here, take 30 kids watch next 10 months friend sat job interview boss. Candidate called several hours interview tell tested positive. Based tests available area means tested well interview. means either contacted contact tracer, symptoms, still went person interview without disclosing that, buddy w/3 young kids qaurantine. Guess get job? able, layman summary antibody vs cell immunity latest understanding around long-term Covid-19 immunity cross-reactivity would superb. obvious flaw plan teachers could get group spread group come different day. went 10 trip Panama volunteer type stuff. stayed area lower socioeconomic status families hosted us homes. remember one girls host family said sick. assumed cold. 

There ill man plane behind way home. figure one two places contracted it. Like covid, air particles breathe. 

(I'm U.S. citizen. Honestly, never given TB much thought time. really realize risk.) 

By way, Panama gorgeous country people kind wonderful. spite troubles after, still think fondly trip. Testing even need slow. could even increasing enough. 

The rate cases growing exponentially. Testing similarly needs grow exponentially (at similar doubling rate) keep up. Another alternative:
He already test queue. Many people take greenlight go public till results out.  go cruises. think is. Making broad statement like end civilization biggest d00mer possible. never see way though so. Good day. They'll pull supplemental staff sub (aides, lunchroom workers, hell probably even tech support) they'll push two classrooms together one teacher make outside something. staff would onboard strike right (money tight family members getting laid off) staff willing strike. Personally, teacher can't afford strike right now. primary breadwinner household. agree part. certainly countable number people getting tested even though suspect they've contact tested positive. There's person work tested 6 times brags it. Right, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know better love trump won‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù 

but instead ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure entire thing president senators support say it‚Äôs blown liberals freaking like always do‚Äù love US pretends pandemic hit time highs cases deaths back 2 months ago levels America trying purge gene pool  Amazing. Sure sure. I'm sure local community college's law program terrific. bet campus similarly afford Nobel Prize winners wandering around, too.

I even go there, let's pretend ""prestige"" open doors use earn ""prestige"". reason are. one really knows sure.

I'm surprised everyone's OK killing grandma find out. feel scariest thing it. leads many people false sense security. could part 1% dies. isn‚Äôt likely, it‚Äôs possible. mention many lasting side effects virus. would venture say majority think ideally kinds school good thing. much nuanced national blanket statement seem indicating.

Here Fauci p, words, discussing Ambition necessarily mean intelligence. work way political machine ambition much useful trait, certain party intelligence clearly way disqualification. cases positive makes relatable base easy thing play into. RIP...

Fuck covid deniers. Fuck hell. feels bad cause vital therapy that‚Äôs time sensitive able happen; realizing unable deliver vital thing child; literally speech..then fuck right off. god damn tragedy 4 year old can‚Äôt meet therapists talk. ""Junk science"" older ""fake news,"" coined relation research global warming climate denialists. days seems lot people use term, still take seriously. like living nightmare. Stuck stupid know change gears. wish could college starting two weeks :/ seen many people screaming Facebook news comments virus can't affect children. talking point going get people killed. sucks told you‚Äôre depressed biggest issue excitement zest life, physically mentally cannot things bring pleasure. Oh God! could anyone known would happen!?11! think less years definitely less decade asked social distance wear masks ect. Adding jumping 14 days decades *huge* leap. Even extra months taken far. 

You answer question possible long term affects sterility? Would quick push kids back school then? Literally work, people come office mask chin/below nose.  risk every time leave house, regardless going take kid school whatever reason is.  zip code neighborhood 11368. Type NYT map see less 5% population infected.

The 68% refers percentage people felt sick went get tested clinic neighborhood, 68% total population neighborhood.

EDIT: I'd also like point neighborhood one hit hardest.  Don‚Äôt even open correct answer. God shitshow is. shame many wear masks mandated. wonder compliance would national mandate. Sweden 23 people per square km 570 deaths per million. 
Finland 16 people per square km 60 deaths per million. 
Norway 14 people per sq km 47 deaths per million. 

The variance way proportional difference population density. Yea fucking retarded? say things like public protest? surly nobody besides ur Reddit gang takes seriously. don‚Äôt lot things society still support better want debate someone send kids die flu season. Good day. That's difference cost credit hours, comparison showed differed food housing. see list $3876 tuition/fees cost online, [on-campus cost $6380. I'm going assume since tuition fees grouped, savings comes things like lab fees, technology fees, student activities fees. 1. I'm taking seriously, too. friends family died, I'd like keep way. We're wearing masks avoiding going indoors anywhere possible. five people house, reason we've buildings outside house necessary doctor appointments. Otherwise we've outside house go outdoor places away large crowds. lived NYC somehow proven herd immunity existed, would great, could start relax restrictions I've placed family. One preprint study enough convince me, absolutely worth sharing story harm it. 
2. I'm suggesting proves anything. said NYC may close herd immunity. academic able notice words chosen others determine someone saying.

I think sacrifices NYC made last five months made sense started locking down, really know anything disease. last couple months learned definitively deadly previously believed, considerably infectious. new information might hypothesize outbreak MAY much farther along certain NYC neighborhoods extent lockdowns happened late make difference. fact people suffered lockdowns reason re-evaluate whether good choice. barred questioning people sacrificed. Maybe sacrificed vain. Maybe still are! know, know. We're without conclusive data right now. I'm bringing alternative narrative prevailing one here. I'm doubling anything concept able question conventional wisdom evolving pursuit truth. CPS tried mass kidnapping circumstances they'd probably succumb Rona making much headway, given contagious kids are. Seems like self-limiting problem. United States YOLO wish best luck. She'll need it. Nobody money nobody wants re-open restaraunts.

Well, that's entirely accurate. SOMEONE money we've creating past decades... mean 10,000 deaths per day... would imagine, they're pressured opening schools 95% custodial, especially younger kids. Keeping every kid home basically freeze economy. kindergardener came home, total 30 minutes actual class (and half small talk), including classes like art gym. Wtf day then, could teach entire day 30 minutes??? son tested week ago got results 24 hours specified. disagreeing "" End day, kids paying ‚ÄúYale‚Äù resume, in-person vs remote doesn‚Äôt really matter."" quote. He‚Äôs wrong: 

Source: finance professor specified. disagreeing "" End day, kids paying ‚ÄúYale‚Äù resume, in-person vs remote doesn‚Äôt really matter."" quote. Yeah. many ""just let everybody work home, nobody needs go office"" sentiment people seem completely unaware everybody works office. (Probably type people woman annoyed told put mask coffeeshop ""there's nobody else here"" - people, service employees count.) tree liberty must watered blood minority service workers. Ok **Children suffer hyperinflammation covid-19: ""deaths extremely rare""**

&amp;#x200B;

**Children infected covid-19 risk potentially life-threatening hyperinflammation. Sweden, 50 otherwise healthy children fallen ill condition several received intensive care.**

**- dangerous disease, deaths extremely rare, says pediatrician Jonas F Ludvigsson.**

In spring, international reports came children tested positive covid-19 later fell ill - cases died - serious multi-inflammatory condition. Initially, condition compared childhood disease Kawasaki, affects 50 children Sweden year.

&amp;#x200B;

\- see something new, even though several similarities Kawasaki's disease, says Jonas F Ludvigsson, pediatrician √ñrebro professor epidemiology Karolinska Institutet.

&amp;#x200B;

The new disease, named multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), mainly affects children couple years old have, among things, greater impact heart, Jonas F Ludvigsson explains.

&amp;#x200B;

\- way, MIS probably worse. seen children strong heart effects, much Kawasaki.

&amp;#x200B;

\- dangerous disease insofar many children become seriously ill require treatment. still case deaths extremely rare.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ten ICU-cases**

In mid-May, Swedish Pediatric Rheumatology Association became aware four suspected MIS cases. Today, figure around 50 cases. ten children received intensive care another three received treatment artificial lung outside body. exceptions, children otherwise healthy.

The condition life-threatening, according Lotta Nordenh√§ll chief physician Sachsska Children's Adolescent Hospital Stockholm chairman Swedish Pediatric Rheumatology Association, child died result disease Sweden.

&amp;#x200B;

\- chosen treat aggressively managed turn cases around. says Lotta Nordenh√§ll.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strong connection covid-19**

The connection covid-19 hyperinflammation previously described Italian researchers Swedish Public Health Agency also following development. Jonas F Ludvigsson says feels quite confident covid-19 triggering factor.

&amp;#x200B;

\- children tested positive covid-19, think due fact everyone seems develop antibodies infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Jonas F Ludvigsson dealt two three suspected cases MIS spring. new conditions worrying, says, long Sweden faced strong second wave autumn, cases likely decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

\- parent, would worry MIS. Democide. Ya think like 3% infection infected surfaces. wash hands like normal person fine. Honestly much bigger risk getting plane without n95/p100 seat wiped down. ""Hey, teacher classroom got COVID students. next substitute list. Get there, Jackson there?"" little bit A, little bit B, whole lot E Ego. son tested Friday afternoon got results Monday morning. Kentucky really well testing. Aww, hope everything works well guys! 

With stepdaughter, sadly, parents addicts constantly fighting (his ex bi-polar) daughter taken away foster care 1 4. fiance (her dad) went rehab took 2nd time completely sober ever since, completely changed things around amazingly well fantastic father! really think would wasn't. 

So that's abandonment issues, unfortunately. feel kid. mother still alcohol problems, anything that. best make feel loved cared about, assure we'll never leave ever.

That's relatively normal terms cost, especially tuition decreases credit hours taken. That's pretty much one class costs me. doubt don‚Äôt want that, long liberal says it, think it‚Äôs demon sperm that‚Äôs talking Thank much!!! best brain. People everywhere saying it. best. open qualify state education funding. Comments threads said eLearning gets lower funding. Honestly 2020 eye opening severely retarded country is. possible Georgia stacks board education unqualified people, know .. nepotists, old people clinging seats fighting dementia, somebody slept thier boss... personality types usually well America.

Actually, doctor told first called ""post-viral depression"", may confuse people. Side note: lit match thrown barrel gasoline put match out. 

Gasoline vapor flammable, liquid form takes match light. Right, works test everyone, everyday. might test negative today, catch tomorrow. Kids might get tested school year, catch day. missing something? wondering, reason online classes encouraged/proposed alternative? least middle/high school. max number cases less 5% per 70% figure referring fact 68% people got tested particular clinic positive. zip code neighborhood ""11368"" NYT map see infection rate less 5% population neighborhood. shocked pikachu face. want teachers get get rid union Another valid arugment students look community colleges transfer desired schools getting education discount.

  Higher education tuition funding become game poker.In dealer best odds.Boards administrators know it.Almost nafariously selling futures young men women like cut throat car salesman.""Oh look dorms,and paint job!"" parents,uncle sam,or future selves pay it.

It's wrong everyone goes along it.Even middle recession pandemic. That's probably control opened. U.S., never control, cases much higher March yet still want send kids back school.  Florida California hot spots. shit causing outbreaks? guarantee lot places getting people sick they're bringing back home. Even lot easier social distance park school. Covid says; lives matter. yup. that's referring regarding lot young(er) people eating doors. many places literally created temporary outdoor dining (with tables jam packed next other). think people even understand they're saying "" schools closed fall."" teacher expected turn work school. 

Now personal perspective hate online schooling. last option would choose since option stay safe, I'm doing. go long list personally hate online classes that's personal thing. I'm expecting get better practice teachers given choice I'd rather face face education. Antibodies meaning recovered Exactly, contagious virus is, recurve wrong direction swiftly Liquid gasoline generally catch fire. It‚Äôs fumes ignite. 

If thrown barrel gasoline, match would extinguish fumes chance react. kids come teachers use Zoom teach. Uh, maybe kid did. Point is, kid exposed others close contact could go expose more....etc etc etc.

What part difficult understand? still remember closed city schools hot AC poor ventilation. going suck. One articles stated public school offered distance learning bit 70% chose person learning.  Get goggles feel pain, friend. tested rheumatoid arthritis younger seeing everything came back ‚Äúperfect‚Äù good years kid fobbed ‚Äúits growing pains, pass.‚Äù can‚Äôt imagine deal celiac top pain (and hear causes additional aches too). time it‚Äôs we‚Äôre scraping people forget, husband too. don‚Äôt want whiner sometimes feel complained would come less shock say can‚Äôt something don‚Äôt strength get bed today. go away 

Like things go away

go, away goes. 


-Donald J. Trump (haiku) Regardless came got it, living fuck actually expect? tired winning! I'm really debating whether send kids back school year. E-Learning, Virtual School, nada, nothing. 

So many poor parents struggle huge debates whether kids get education, teachers risk lives, that. Hey, idea. Lets send till everyone pulls head asses. save lot heartache trouble lots parents children alike. 9 Y.O son far safer home ""Alone"" mind you, going school playing Russian Roulette. 99% kids fine without school next 6 months, even year, heck even till vaccine.

Articles come every day relating schools kids contracting Coronavirus. wrong people! Stand yourselves. understand many arrogant people seeing correlation schools spreading virus. guarantee parents saying open school lived Juarez, Mexico, Tijuana would be. ""Don't go outside safe"". virus comes along, means, ""get somebody"". I'm sorry going through. understand challenges trying work young child home. can't imagine trying own. I'm right losing mind trying stay top all. 

I know easier said done, try kind find little ways make things easier, even means allowing screen time things differently normally do. know kiddo fine long feels loved. ‚ù§Ô∏è Politics sister grade school teacher, mom 3 age 11. says thing. Myself? husband only. senior fall. WFH parents years. Maybe one. selfish AF. make sure time ourselves, individually hobbies, even shopping groceries. Heck 13 years horse drove round trip home hour 1 way. Twice day. Plus would disappear weekend HOURS time. honestly saw horse often husband, scene would travel work. kid infant/toddler would go away LARP weekends. \*kinda reason bought horse\* need make sure time set aside setting burn people already struggling? fuck talking Yo someone else already provided sources chose ignore hard lesson learn the....hahahahahah man almost convinced they'd learn change. Sorry kid. Politicians appearances keep up. can't open schools massive viral outbreak preface statement with; ""Out abundance caution..."" heard ear savers? one, cutting one strong sheet plastic would work, put paper clips together hook mask onto paper clips instead ears. Neck gaiter's effectiveness would depend fabric, see Table 5 material study.  really?! may spread easily enclosed spaces protection people inches apart?

 whodathunkit. assumption going let students get sick. Sounds like American thing do. Considering majority financially affected Wage earners one parent can‚Äôt work Schools closed. let‚Äôs give guys break. Online classes April, May, June, September, October, November, December. That‚Äôs SEVEN MONTHS class instruction. damage terms development falling behind enormous. I‚Äôm teacher. got get back soon. Development Social Settings happens school K-12. It‚Äôs especially critical K-3. Yes it‚Äôs necessary keep closed. ESPECIALLY Orange Red Zoned States. Georgia one them.
GREEN ZONE: Infection Rate less 1 per 100,000. Vermont Zone.
YELLOW ZONE: IR 1-9. Per 100,000 (28 States)
ORANGE ZONE: IR 10-24 Per 100,000
 ?????
RED ZONE IR per 100,000 (21 States). must strive get kids back classroom January. Yeah grew around lot adults lots kids zero time patience constantly acted like massive nuisance. parents like this.

My kids young pretty needy, I'm looking forward going school  (when safe) husband time catch breath. also believe good them, education behaviour make easier us attentive they're home. Right four us home 24/7 we're starting drive crazy. keep told years. first 14 days. decade seems reasonable point.

Seriously, think going less years rate?  worries. Stay safe. confirm, got brain tickler drive cvs, still took 6 days result. Copied u/eranski

‚ÄúSweden fared better economically compared neighbours, according Imperial report: (top page 7)‚Äù

It‚Äôs early compare anyway, probably never fully able fair comparisons. much differs countries. likely, turning kids walking death traps parents, teachers, etc. fact legally. People always stupid likely always will. 

The lack political leadership disinformation culture deadly virus pandemic..  One findings though damage independent severity illness, I‚Äôm sure presume that. vaccine may reduce across board, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs given.

I‚Äôm saying vaccines aren‚Äôt good news, scenarios continued vigilance may still required. Life likely largely return normal vaccine made available - increased mask use doesn‚Äôt big deal people made it. I‚Äôd happy enough life back normal except masks outside house. know experts calling masks *and* social distancing widespread adoption make mask use unnecessary, imo. Health officials North America always reluctant admit contrary anti mask positions early - look success Asian countries widespread masks use.

I wasn‚Äôt aware wrt influenza, thank you. got positive results got back plane? Yeah read article yesterday saying study showed potentially around 1% Ontarians virus already. means 75% either symptomatic didn‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt get tested. necessarily bad thing, yikes, especially school year. actually though Yes does, however, suggest got infected school.

You inferred something complaining mistaken inference.

Edit: Downvote away, headline writer's fault reading carefully. Kid positive tested. kid wasn‚Äôt tested, wouldn‚Äôt positive. Take that, Science! neighbor died months back Covid-19 family believes got home health worker one else ever went house lock started. family would sit outside patio talk french doors, kept closed, want infect her.

Its companies like one cousin works blood hands. irresponsible cruel clients staff.

My neighbor sweet old lady. :( Hiding automod. ü§´ remember asking question weeks ago people gave kinds answers.

Some people thought everyone could get results 15 minutes, waiting week results old stuff happened March.

There‚Äôs lots differences cities kinds tests. It‚Äôs disorganized. splitting student body 2 3 ways ever portion kids school time others distance learning

Doesn't require 2-3 times many teachers? teachers handling online class in-person class time? true. depends testing analysing. hospitals labs result take 24 hours, limited capacity city hospital give test come contact someone tested positive showing two symptoms. wanted test (before seeing mother law) symptoms went urgent care uses external labs. could paid $150 results back 24 hours wait 3-5 days results back 5 days. wait time urgent care lab partners 7 days, it‚Äôs 21 days CVS lab partners. it‚Äôs literally case priority (and hospitals without labs get priority well) backed labs are.  Online classes vs entire full school experience full access campus, resources, events/activities pretty clearly huge loss value. think strong case. 

Yale endowment 30 billion, all. I'm South Dakota. got results 2 days. seen Georgia? vulnerable teachers gonna great time couple weeks Probably weasel brought tested after. real evidence reinfection, handful supposed occurrences mean next nothing right now. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Perhaps read actual guidelines CDC saying that‚Äôs virus travels. That‚Äôs realistic, provided either vaccine shows safe effective phase 3 clinical trials currently underway. 
\-ALR got tested, doctor told assume covid negative got results back. 

In opinion, assume positive receiving negative result. Especially rate asymptomatic carriers. Georgia's going learn tough lesson coming weeks b feel like fairly good grasp virus related information. one thing I'm still completely confused about.

What different Sweden's strategy, managed prevent exponential growth measures would consider good strategy? think kids bubble? spread teachers staff, kids take back families. see logical outcome reopening schools pandemic spreads easily crowded, enclosed spaces?

[edit] Ah anti-masker. wife exposing covid putting tubes patients' throats ventilate lungs turn swiss cheese assholes like you. get shots plantar fasciitis!?! Since when? much help?
  
I twice life, first time left foot painful like 6 months doc tell stretch rub frozen water bottle area. Second time bad resolved pretty quickly. 6 months painful I've experienced crazy things we‚Äôve taken lot precautions (albeit great timed well) thousands still dying. absurd think ""thought process"" connected. like train yard random cars spread across multiple tracks engineers available get actual train connected leave yard. emperor without clothes told we‚Äôre great. Bigly. I'm trying rude move Sunday stressed possible case? plan distancing first week, Wednesday, already fell through? wife rapid test done pregnant. result came back two hours  Thats reserved parents want accuse fantasy, please read say, instead scanning key words typing.

""I proposal here; **it's probably anyone now**""

***IF*** system followed it, would better system today. want system. need enable system exist occurs. mom teacher school postponed 6 weeks week supposed start. surprised even person school point.

Her class 24 students (much less 6 feet apart) supposed provided mask face shield. Yes, one two scenarios:  
1. stay home re-flatten curve point community transmission extremely low able contain new cases testing contact tracing. We‚Äôre nowhere near able that, unlikely short term. 


2. safe effective vaccine identified based phase 3 clinical trial data. enough people vaccinated, transmission decrease substantially achieve herd immunity vaccination. depends enough people taking vaccine enough vaccine available vaccinate substantial proportion population.

\-ALR That‚Äôs thought also heard antibodies wear off? quite sure that‚Äôs correct not. Dam low key exposed big ugly two days makes contact tracing useless

Lol no. gets exponentially difficult do, never useless. think strange thing colleges targets criticism. First, force anyone attend, optional. go expensive college. go wherever want all. plenty people recommend it, entirely students choice. Secondly students driving tuition up. keep selecting schools based nice many amenities offer. culture campus tours picking based like experience. schools building offering clubs services because; they're there's demand it. odd students pick schools know relative tuition....then blame school expensive tricked. go expensive school. Stop creating demand. Yes please worry, I'm sure kid gets infected. Trump Co fellas. seem like they're better time it. initial assumption wrong: planning closing positive results students. even planning notifying anyone student tests positive---it'll ""up health department"" contact tracing. answer could get they're planning kids teachers need start quarantining punitive attendance policy. Well rights south. it‚Äôs illegal keep child home unless you‚Äôre legally homeschooling them. hands tied. protections. parents probably also work south never properly locked refuses now. feed family kids home can‚Äôt work. can‚Äôt work maybe don‚Äôt get health care insurance they‚Äôre professional job. It‚Äôs mess. America developing country. Thank you, I'm okay. posted experience previous poster used word hopeless. wanted show okay struggling. worse others matter deeply impacted current situation, okay feel bad it. want people feel hope. get better. dont know believe it. Keep safe wear mask! thousands Families time educate kids go work make ends meet? able teach daughter mean parents can. 

Secondly, terms online teaching viable method long term teaching? 

On point vaccines hope I'm proved wrong can't see one readily available end next year. find reliable source tells change mind sure link it. It‚Äôs misleading, you‚Äôre good critical thinking Canton GA populated suburb metro Atlanta 3k people die terrorists - everybody loses minds.

140k people die virus - is. Many tried. large number provided free meals, free computers free internet. can't make kid log them. lies issue. attempted calls least two times week every student things scheduled every single day kids. kids never showed. That's problem is. parent cant wont make kid answer phone log nothing I'd bet that's football team name. That‚Äôs tough one. I‚Äôm honestly sure right call is. feel like pulling asymptomatic frontline healthcare workers could cause cascading failure across home health long term facility care, resulting even dire situation, also realize healthcare workers human beings families. 

Fuck, year. Oh please. Southwest best customer service US airline. Indeed forget insurance. Commercial insurance prob takes $1,000 per year thereabouts. Depending group rates course. Still think reasonable overall. Herd immunity estimated somewhere 60-80% population. Best case scenario 1% death rate, would shy 2 million dead Americans.

Herd immunity without using vaccine viable solution. limits much responsibility adult displace leadership. people completely ignore long term side effects real chances surviving long term disability get covid. See? That's done start! constantly live hot yoga room, IQ *is* higher. great strategy /s. bury head sand pretend everything awesome. indicator actual learning. Hmm? understand, seems conventional, medical knowledge ""google"", reason get Shingles virus causes Chickenpox. words, got Chickenpox naturally, get Shingles alter life. prevent Shingles, vaccinate, then, virus cannot cause Shingles later life. make sense.

Now, claim anything goes conventional wisdom - deliver studies say otherwise. Upvote calling Dump. heard one before! hypothetical grounded current research done towards finding vaccine candidate. Chances see wide scale vaccine availability January people vaccinated even earlier. lot depends results clinical trials currently underway. vaccine phase 3 clinical trials proves safe effective within next months, vaccine available end year.  
Normally would lag approval scale-up production, since manufacturers don‚Äôt want take huge cost burden making vaccine might approved. Operation Warp Speed terrible name, sensible thing: funding vaccine manufacturing prior regulatory approval, thus offsetting financial risk making millions doses unproven vaccine. candidates phase 3 trials ready go get FDA emergency use authorization.  
However, it‚Äôs important note everyone immediate access newly approved vaccine. still require time (months) make enough vaccine meet demand. Priority go people high exposure risk, like front line health care workers.  
The number doses/frequency immunization depend type vaccine. vaccines provide protection single shot, require booster. We‚Äôll see vaccines prove effective phase 3 trials. 
\-ALR think big difference Canada, even asymptomatic carriers, case load much much lower similar areas US. 

There going outbreaks, that's given, key going rapid identification outbreaks proper first-level contact containment/quarantine prevent spreading further. Unfortunately rely people responsible though, may undoing. Well testing, phase 3 shit. guess still wait. Let's keep positive, that's anyway. janitorial staff. cafeteria workers. teachers‚Äô aides. school administrative assistants. families. 

So many people sacrificed sake economy inability charge admit wrong.  read article stated bio companies willing risk money ramp production. real way cash infusion husband SARS 1.

He almost died. ICU 2 weeks fever high long tell was, credibility. I'm serious. extremely lucky alive.

He recovered, really fucked afterwards. still is.

I told doctors thing kept happening kept ignoring me, brushing off.

What happened periodically ten years following illness, would get mini, 24 hour ""SARS attack"" call it. symptoms come back. insane headache, fever, brain fog, it.

And goes away again.

The doctors thought hysterical witness it, take word it. time could get doctor, gone again. trace.

There must example someone SARS 1 happen them, CANNOT life fathom would even followed on.

I surprised ANYTHING SARS 2. boss? literally deserve die xD Theres us infect. Oh no! think you‚Äôll make it?!? Everyone says that. Read manuals. Read books. - Donny city teachers went strike got community members fill in. mostly old people even know work pencil sharpener brought 1950s sensibilities classroom. One old guy even threatened hit kids paddle small transgressions. disaster. wife got tested. Asymptomatic screening healthcare workers hospital. Tests run hospital results 12 24hr. tf going school summer?  fwiw, studies I've seen, asymptomatic spread actually pretty rare. problem asymptomatic presymptomatic look exactly presymptomatic spread definitely rare. Online works kids, all. high schooler autism well online learning. person schooling lot sensory distractions bother present home environment work well own.

But daughter learning disability well.

I think online learning always complicated disabilities involved. younger children. going issue homes no/limited internet access. homes parents unable assist children (either bc work bc skills/education help). September, 50% Georgians would corona positive. Mark words mean Fauci said wouldn‚Äôt inside restaurant flying plane. That‚Äôs damning indictment. Sweden lot like Nordic countries like Italy Spain. easier isolate school closed. Kids dumb resort guidelines school. parents watch them, doubt many kids consider gravity situation. Good luck trying get kids wear masks day. point get much harder school starts would surprised kids start dying this. sounds logical me. Happened workplace close family member. coworker‚Äôs wife sick tested positive, guy got tested came work waiting results. happened mention passing someone else office, reported it. Management dragged feet couple days eventually sent home. test came back negative allowed return even though still getting exposed daily sick wife. Why? he‚Äôd already tested negative. common sense. family member frustrated fortunately able work home unrelated reasons long enough seems blown without anyone else catching it. Freedom infect people. ridiculous. That‚Äôs things work, dumbasses. don‚Äôt freedom whatever want. don‚Äôt freedom murder people, hit them, even threaten cases. don‚Äôt freedom throw trash streets. don‚Äôt freedom walk around naked. 

##You don‚Äôt freedom infect people. guys? Really, reasoning this? Like nobody get covid school? news? course kids going become infected. Children incredibly efficient spreading germs. Maybe pilots. would bring new meaning phrase [sterile lol imagine trusting numbers US. would take away least two zeros, like 13 deaths Yes, schools many Asian countries like Japan South Korea continue use ‚Äúhomeroom‚Äù model high school cohort students stay classroom day (even sometimes eating lunch classroom) teachers move out. It‚Äôs absolutely possible. understanding mistaken. use Teams office? work healthcare organization that‚Äôs pretty left-wing that‚Äôs rule too. it‚Äôs 10 days first started experiencing symptoms supposedly unlikely infectious. Schools opening make number look tiny, RIP grandparents live grand kids I'm I've 4 tests. get results 3 hours. Vanderbilt Hospital TN standards, yes, lowered ones. reason distance learn uni freshman. Go CC basics 1/10 cost. F that. come nursery schools similar places closed seen rise infection?
Edit. I'm UK  Preprint done pieces shit? End indoor dining , bars casinos . Simple shutting subway system, even cleaning contributed directly spreading throughout city thoroughly did. Either cuomo deblasio answer that. Nyc/NYS definitely prime example handle pandemic, Despite population density. everyone died 2 months ago way, stimulate local businesses cash relief funds recipients. Catholic Church get billion dollars? doubt spent local businesses. ;) Parents send kids school sick time. Unfortunately, probably different. Within ONE DAY - FTFY know say 100% confidence Dr. Fauci, studying infectious diseases since 1968, understands numbers better you. many presidential administrations work for? seems like NYC good case study happens don‚Äôt act quickly, also good example implementing protective measures slow spread. Don‚Äôt think people NYC stuck preventive measures deserve supported recognized that? seems like good example - cautionary tale - hold states preventive measures loose nonexistent.  they're lying? Chinese actually critical government early days epidemic.

Unfortunately nobody could hear behind welded shut doors homes I, unlike certain people shall remain nameless avoid automod‚Äôs wrath, perfectly understand per capita matters.

What also matters test positivity rate reliability government. India‚Äôs numbers could easily factor ten more. spent lot time I. India USA. India doesn‚Äôt cases deaths US, changes everything know virus spreads, way people live state cities India makes US Covid party look like hospital. Teacher here,

I get sick first month school every year without shit.

It's unavoidable. wont make flu season. US massive wakeup call stay course. Childcare services already gone due first shutdown, closed cant afford reopen. Operating costs gone 300% average case.

This going get fucked, Trump's fault. USA #1...in stupidy deaths! smh confirm. soon get 1.6 million... classic example Intelligence vs wisdom.

Intelligent enough figure make fake company get money government. 

Not wise enough think would get caught. fool Universities cut costs 50%. camp require masks? Agreed. learn college, even happened take history medicine course lark. No.
Get cloth mask tie-backs. adjust face. Many places sell also order them. moving goalposts. 

Someone high risk dies? ""They underlying conditions. safe healthy!""

Someone healthy dies? ""They probably unknown underlying conditions. still safe healthy! said died positive test! can't prove covid!"" kids shouldn‚Äôt go school based ? Rules mix alcohol like water mixes oil.  sister sending kids school Georgia brother law thinks ""it's way kid learn"". hope able stay healthy. though. let's keep focused Coronavirus. really appreciate difference subreddit politics subreddit really want keep subreddit focused, stated goal rules.

I talking Topic political subreddit earlier today agreement, subreddit discussion salacious commentary politicians alleged pedophilia.

Different subs different topics; Please obey rules subreddit.


 care post gets downvoted like prior one. Discussion non coronavirus related subjects discouraged and, think, good reason. Heterogeneity subreddits create multiple different cultures think appropriate recognize participating subreddit. Holy shit, GOOD ONE!!

Is next retort, ""I'm rubber, glue...""? I'm kicking ass! MIND!? reddit comment get downvoted, see reddit hivemind could give two shits life. Seriously...

But lives friends family? That's different story. im 100% selfish asshole. drama far outpace actual sickness rate. I've got popcorn. must shut schools this! know article still city. crimes worth punishing violent ones? Jeez... I'm going look that.

Here get MMR shot. Heck I'm considering going boosters everything.. Actually guys, people died flu covid 19 last 2 years, stop fear mongering. take daily bleach injection you‚Äôll fine  Honestly, numbers. insistence open even though number cases deaths going up. insistence masks violation freedom. insistence forms gatherings okay others not. *how* handling makes us worst.   didn't. article, got downvoted pointing out, wants us think got school, upvote crap everything like this. Look Sweden. obvious lockdown needed, probably actually hurt NY'ers Covid did. DIED! :-D (but literally) texted son said, ""Did non-reading motherfucker tell RTFM?"" ignoring point make seem like Christ-like beacon morality. rather need stop stupid.  one thought 1 second reason US cases population size compared freedoms granted citizens.

People US used forced anything aside paying taxes. So, take psychological dynamics US population drive keep food table consideration. results going higher rates infection virus kills less 1% people infected. 7io
Pl underestimate many people willing teach students. people thick People thread don‚Äôt understand state works... can‚Äôt fathom least one portion country taking precautions following guidelines. 200,000 unnecessary deaths acceptable, even worth consideration, you? anti-social psychotic behavior. get help. I‚Äôm far anti-vax idiot. don‚Äôt even buy new tech it‚Äôs updates. don‚Äôt love idea vaccines rushed. totally respect be, I‚Äôll quarantining bottle booze see y‚Äôall turn Zombies least month so. Cheers multiple countries reopened schools reopen see increase infection Europe

It's totally different reopen schools safety measures following lockdown made cases drop say ""we keep schools open, children infect easily find sources Denmark

Good example. stabilizing low numbers thanks 5 weeks long lockdown, Denmark carefully prepared reopening schools step step.     
Hand sanitizers, outside classes, small groups, social distance rules strict guidelines implemented. kids asked wash hands going school keep distances other. Tests regularly made ensure outbreak would follow - cases closing school would immediatly effective. parents reluctant first reassured measures.         
If Sweden want imitate Denmark, I'm it. remainder, wasted probably infected others

Evidence...? incredibly low rate testing unique BC Canada North America generally. really bloody pathetic. water fountains? Dude criminal. Everyone acts like every life matters same. Truth world better place that‚Äôs she‚Äôs worm food. Jeff, turn. might rise popularity online education, schools need teachers. experiment shown certain percentage students teachers prefer working remotely, carry knowledge forward. (Trying find silver lining it‚Äôs really, really hard) safe think staying airbnb right now? small getaway booked, host said need bring beddings they‚Äôd disinfecting... 4 hours check last tenant I‚Äôd arrive.. second thoughts. Tbh least admit saying reach respect American exceptionalism, baby! Well, information like that? stuff deep worry later. lol Read local districts plan. like ours, going shut unless there's huge number city forces to. Lot Puritanism threads religion here. unspoken reality shaming concept today far days Scarlet Letter. said ""warn *some* people"" quarantine husband goes something think risky. simply tell getting shit. make asshole? don‚Äôt think so, gonna forever. REALLY dick get Covid end sick months. contagious, honest.

No one scared HIV/AIDS get it.

Also 99% overall folks 60, 2-3% die...

EDIT: prevalent symptoms (scaring lung tissue) comorbidity going forward. Genocidal go vacation now? I‚Äôm glad ‚Äútesting‚Äù states. done without masks one largest outbreaks, done places. power V compels you! NYC area residents. Rest state still pretty low infection rates. Agreed. mask and/or distance inside large stadium limited amount fans pretty easily, plus it‚Äôs outdoor setting. no. go protest outdoors, wear face covering protect around you. nearly every protestor done continues do. hankie great face covering.

pretty simple stuff understand actually! can't even summon enough enthusiasm perform kabuki theater? Aww, poor little airline.

/s players want bubble. voted down. want away families home months. Kids naturally filthy, dirty nasty little creatures, bless hearts.  


Parents teach use toilet, shower, bathe brush teeth, touch faces time, wash hands, cover mouth coughing chew mouths closed, effing even sneeze properly. wonder schools hotbeds infection colds &amp; flu. 


I love kids, dang, they're nasty. Blame parents. Seriously. really shows horrific Italy, Spain, France peaks.

About Spain peaked 6x bad currently US currently. Imagine US \~6000 death/day. one neighborhood. Yes Jackson, Elmhurst, Woodside might reached 70%. limited travel since lockdown (subways still full capacity) many people lockdown months neighborhoods come close that.  use bathroom. Tinder, come take arnt Ivy+, Princeton known grade deflation, inflation. Furthermore, don‚Äôt think MIT, Caltech, U Chicago get prestige connections way off. Stanford also isn‚Äôt Ivy younger Ivy. ex wife tn got tested day took 15min. results leaving. Clearly jealous Beirut's attention. Kinda - quite popular overseas tourists, nowhere near popular Sydney, virus taken anywhere near big hold.

Melbourne (the capital) lively, cosmopolitan place - weather's shit fair chunk year. 

the capital really coast, per se - ""let's go coast"" destination...

I think state government dropped ball times early stages pandemic, they're paying it.

A lot big outbreaks aged care homes - quite often share nursing / cleaning staff. 

the old folks passing other, pass family members go visit they're sick... community. kids school August? places, symptoms put test higher-priority queue.

However, general, states local areas lot faster - 2-3 day turnaround me. got one Monday night results today tomorrow. Oh no! He‚Äôll 99.9% chance survival! got credential Sandy Hook, I‚Äôm inclined agree. Imagine hostages inside burning building. fun. ""Why both?"" - merica color sky fantasy land enough rapid tests available, lab testing capability, pull testing millions people everyday, less 8 hours time? Covid19: mountain molehill. What‚Äôs smaller molehills actually? personally honored apart first real life conspiratorial psy op! Go 49ers!!!! Wooooooooooo Imagine responsible killing parents brought virus home. 

I'm already thinking going home Christmas want conscience. Spain getting fines wear places, closed place.

As European see news total lunacy. hard believe. frustration. Everyone criticizing remote learning spring, went virtual overnight. district, three days classroom going full virtual. optimal, recognize that. However, districts could spent summer building great virtual education plans creating support systems special needs low income students succeed virtual learning. could partnered businesses community come safe childcare options parents. could staff professional development virtual instruction. months could made plans knock virtual learning park fall. Instead, spent time coming idiotic plans reopen students faced danger constant disruption education. teacher, I‚Äôm livid. Viruses inducing behavior help spread exactly without precident. regular pheumonia get Covid19, fatality rate increase? Universities expenses before, faculty, staff, building maintenance, costs etc.. Plus retrain faculty staff use new online tools buy software. Plus losing tons revenue room board athletic departments. 

If built start online, point weren't. *insert gif fry saying he‚Äôs shocked really shocked* sound hopeful. think they're idiots, give rats ass happens people, convenience way important anything else. ""I've got mine, fuck yours""-mentality. Hopefully comment doesn‚Äôt continue go unnoticed. really appreciated it. assistant manager get shit end stick relay info make sense. usually end sentence ""I know dumb af, get done"". live Georgia. terrible here. Luckily work finances masks required branch required wear anytime someone comes in. one supply one per person. 

What's really messed right million parents would rather send child school actually parent take care child home. parents want get back semblance normalcy personal lives work lives centered around child.

Also tons restaurants, probably 85%, taking social distancing seriously comes many people allowed inside tables seat at. drive Mexican restaurant everyday drive home always packed people sitting outside area since parking lot always full safely assume interior seating also packed.

Most people posting crap FB Biden devil also people thought since something like 2 people died Ebola Obama fired. Yet they'll never acknowledge 160k+ death count Trump due horrid response virus. 

Our governor, Kemp, literally piece shit. He's trying sue mayors trying make mask wearing mandate even though wears one... Someone please freaking help us. people dumb. I'm waiting someone cause scene store I'm try hand one fake ADA medical issue cards says wear mask due medical condition. cards fake btw, corporate office sent us emails regarding them. SHUT DOWN. situation would need examined particulars. kids go back school, virus spreads people die. Many people. Honestly, families teaching children thousands years. places school isn‚Äôt effective anyway it‚Äôs basically childcare. better job daughters‚Äô teachers anyway. Keep school online. likely, probably vaccine much sooner that. mean, party would nominate rapist/pedophile already senile instead three dozen choices? basement flooded yesterday. ""It is"" saying shit got water damaged.

""It is"" would say 150,000 dead Americans. Opening schools lead us shut whole country *again*, that's none business. Yeah people covid-19 reinfected covid-19 rhinovirus create necessary antibodies. even worth clicking. Clickbait best case scenario It‚Äôs years cousin. She‚Äôs still struggling. used play fast-paced game like charades Password, great it. peak illness tried playing again, could not. scary. phrase use something literally control deal everything possible control situation circumstances improve.


I think safely argue POTUS fit either circumstances comes situation. Test scores later wont show difference. Public schools inner cities really daycare. need burn hell. I‚Äôm glad son safe healthy, lucky. Hope family stays well. 

Dorms &amp; Greek houses - said it. It‚Äôll like jails nursing homes. October interesting got results back Monday test took July 12th There's lot testing returning day next day now.

People St Paul gone 9am gotten called 6pm. Kids gonna die anyone start caring probably Republicans ~~(nearly~~ all). FTFY. Name one Dem who's acting irresponsibly. Teachers dead thousands schools reopen... Dr Ferguson‚Äôs model clearly show physical Schools thing PAST!!! Wanderlust precautions take teaching school?

I kn95 n95 masks. 

I face shield goggles take kids‚Äô temperatures.

I‚Äôm wearing scrubs work every day.

I‚Äôm seeing anyone else family home babysitter.

I‚Äôm putting fan classroom increase airflow since one door windows.

Every student must 6 feet apart me.

I eat lunch every day outside. 

I shower immediately get home.

Is anything else do? ""Read manuals, read books."" That's definitely clickbait headline trying convey buy history books store get conspiracy theory bullshit from. Abbott also letting positive results antibody testing count towards confirmed cases. can't, everyone sheep like you.  forgetting elderly likely vote him, especially swing states. expecting altruistic good-hearted. even purely selfish point view, move best secures chance reelection would curb virus onset? 

1. sooner reopen sooner economy rebound. reopening work people wearing masks. reopening also work people spending they're fearful.
2. virus kills voter base disproportionately (the elderly). enough give concern, no?

For guy who's supposedly good playing 4D chess, he's failing see 2D chess 2 moves ahead. Woah, happen?? travel living million+ miles I've flown think contribute illness health issue flight I've on. listen Pediatricians instead pretending expert online? Certain states CVS pharmacy 15min test available. absolutely don‚Äôt know they‚Äôll fine. evidence pointing even asymptomatic cases organ damage. Pretty much look air travel now. 100% even consider getting plane vaccine I've it. I‚Äôm NYC received results within 24 hours. Granted went hospital directly, testing speed advanced pretty rapidly. also going wind killing parents teachers too. Eh, flu vaccine ~45% last year? 50% efficacy minimal side effects would still HUGE impact. goddamn truth. know know title, makes think something creepy fuck might seen / read child. That‚Äôs true. students, falls firmly category ‚Äúnot problem‚Äù ‚Äústuff we‚Äôre charging allowing use of.‚Äù people know tested results day UK. area looks peaking right reopen schools. Kinda doubtful happen. course did. expected. What's surprising parent would send child school pandemic. took Abbott test ago (negative), got results around day. pretty easy. True - firms lined next phase trial prior getting results assumption everything landing butter side up. Trump charge behavior. Whether wear mask, stay home, keep distance go out. responsible that.

You think leadership changes people put masks? Young adults say thanks bars, parties, protests? kidding yourself. Good luck that. US going nowhere current approach. general population left pick bill huge amount government debt incur massive damage. WTF public pool? thank democratic governor that. got results day test. Less actually maybe 18 hours. I‚Äôm Philadelphia test last week. want risk life children?

Millions people infected California kids magically isolated school closed. Zero deaths. guys logical arguments make resort emotional pleas. argument literally cliche ""WONT SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK CHILDREN!?!?!?!"" Schools even thinking testing requirements. kidding ? Remain? Lol  battle out. one. Huh. get results day now? least people know got tested (Quebec Canada) think fact interstate travel completely unrestricted?

I think yet another ""fact"" bears checking.

Interstate travel *not* ""completely unrestricted"". Numerous states, counties, municipalities imposed mandatory quarantines advisories out-of-area travelers. instance [New York, New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Kansas, Hawaii, Florida, Alaska.

Beyond quarantines, there's much done. government cannot prevent interstate travel. constitutionally protected right.

But know think I'm answer questions. I'm not.

I'm try get people like stop spreading fake news. idea student got school before, probability passed fairly high. would say. Pittsburgh got results same-day  Dr Ferguson right beginning ! virus EXPONENTIAL surface area means exposure? lung capacity means exposure? social popularity means exposure? doubt virus-laden aerosols likely float higher article seems suggest. Massive storm? Lol We've seen like 3 worse storms Summer nobody even noticed. Stop reading headlines. That's good way stay informed. receive reprimand/be put list

**THIS GOING PERMANENT RECORD!** Agreed. 3 shots goal much better 1. works $188 - $211 per day (180 school days average). 

Taking $25 fuel maintenance leaves $163 - $186 bus driver wage. Considering work 9 hour day, becomes $18 - 20 per hour. bad. 1. Europe managed keep rates Covid-19 well USA? contact tracing programs? better compliance? act earlier? even responsible states USA still comparing badly Europe measuring percentage population Covid-19 one time.

2. point opening USA based number cases alone, without considering whether Rt would rise beyond 1? anyone modeled effect policies move Rt? isn‚Äôt emphasis whether Rt 1, cases particular time figuring policy response? (I‚Äôm saying sheer numbers shouldn‚Äôt matter all, trying avoid exponential growth, I‚Äôm baffled hasn‚Äôt bigger part discussion.)

3. haven‚Äôt done massive contact tracing testing here. reason make precursor chemicals USA? tested (esp via saliva) school kids teachers day could quickly figure problem is. isn‚Äôt talk this? mass testing tracing combined enforced quarantine, could hugely diminish case numbers. countries this. can‚Äôt we? opinion?

4. believe vaccine mandatory people take without ill effects health? else get people take assuming find one?

5. think significant preexisting immunity cross reactivity coronaviruses? NYC super low case count despite officially near Hurd immunity. Could background immunity too?

6. think homemade cloth masks. read aren‚Äôt washed daily, accumulate pathogens. However also read daily washing increases pore size within week two ability filter much reduced. Would best people washed daily got new ones week / every 5 days used them? 

7. WHO/CDC weren‚Äôt completely honest reduced trust large scientific organizations. deliberate misinformation masks early also reduced public trust. know scientists trying get people buy masks maximize availability hospitals. less trust. also understand masks cause people take actions defeat purpose. overall wish scientists would said - yes work, hospitals needs etc, use incorrectly take risks counterproductive. think treating general public like adults less like children?

8. G614 strain understand correctly likely spread. read suggestions less lethal. good evidence back less lethal assertion?

9. saw strong advocate inclusion STEM. lot people disabilities physician developmental often included. It‚Äôs rare see wheelchairs lab. Autistic people get bullied labs. improve situation stop discriminating disabled people STEM? think symptom called ‚Äúout network provider.‚Äù need studies chronic disability stats soon possible. people politicians see long term consequences economic social, might start getting seriously.

Within next two decades scores people disability unable work due virus. drag current crisis generational crisis. social distancing hard baby take guess, bet it‚Äôs Trump. Wait, literly anyonethink single person going get Covid?

I think ever expectation. ""Using shared kitchen accommodation - proxy deprivation - also significant factor, countries..."" umm, what??? sinus infection sent home job get tested. tested Friday Lab Saturday afternoon. anyone gets tested, call clinic get results. tested told LabCorp app results quickest. missed 3 days work finally got results calling LabCorp app finally updated results 2 weeks tested. Death worse regression.  Causing significant psychological trauma putting children situation create outbreaks hurt care worse regression.  ever actually gave fuck students would brainer you.  putting views education lives students putting danger.  Like said much sympathy teachers anymore fixation anything everything actual welfare students.  Public education needs revamp needs start teachers like you. ""selfish"" claim hold lot water. realize obesity underlying conditions much spread masks social distancing, sad. hate this. I‚Äôm sorry loss fact people can‚Äôt wrap heads around this. 

Pisses see people wearing mask giving ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give shit‚Äù look. Like think sit meeting somewhere plan make thing worse something?! want get better!!! Exactly this. Trump creates chaos purpose fly, top head. never anything say never takes accountability. Since corruption knows bounds he‚Äôs constant state distraction. 

By creating enemy draw focus away corruption incompetence, installs false consciousness mouth breathing base. 

And pray alter logic, waste energy trying help helplessly lost. 

Literally anyone would improvement. 

Vote. ""but brown, American"" - Trump probably feeling it‚Äôs facade( state anyway). think want schools prioritize safety coming back open remotely schools focus technology issues instead prepping open. think state announce week schools open. state remote learning plans submitted August 21. complete remote learning plan meets certain criteria. 

I also think state trying give people little want, too, putting facade. People want normalcy, people kids back school! People need summer break rejuvenate quarantine. think state giving people illusion go back lockdown. 

I think backlash. Parents making plans kids wonky school schedule, parents able go back work, people pissed told one thing flips fast plans made fall apart. honestly, think I‚Äôm end people happier point schools aren‚Äôt opening. Right normal, kids going back school wouldn‚Äôt normal. schools different schedules. learning lot remotely need guidance adult. Day cares aren‚Äôt accepting kids. Kids going back school even chaotic lifestyle. school approaches parents start figuring logistics shit, numbers going summer festivities, think they‚Äôll happier schools closed.

Edit add: states schools open, give two weeks tops. thinking open try get bit person students teachers, teachers administration colleagues. also people erroneously think teachers anywhere 3-4 months ‚Äúoff‚Äù summer vacation. two best. plenty PD it. Took 16 days asymptomatic, close contact two positive tests. live Indiana. Also worth noting deaths attributed state person lives in. Florida tourist state real question many deaths actually caused? test vaccine 100% effective. understand point. I'm sure realizing now? school keeping kids in-school learning classrooms 10 students. interact students classes day. someone classroom tests positive every student class quarantine home 14 days. ideal they‚Äôve summer camps area without causing widespread outbreaks. area low infection rate reason hopeful approach work. Better lock everything now! /s exactly heard. family back home Georgia. Grapevine exactly happened. Tested end last week, still waiting, sent kid school anyways. point there's likely spreader every class across entire nation. infecting peers, turn infect parents grandparents friends. feel like could Onion article title... lived Rotterdam Turkey cup. People lost collective shit. 50 protestors? even enough lineup frites verkoper. Man seeing people still trying rely temperature scanners point akin watching doctor take tray leeches consultation 'that guy'. example ""How bad could get' really helps country trying justify measures. Really, want say actually saving lot lives outside US....so...thanks, America Friends mine doctors Chicago, flew Philippines within last month. quarantine 14 days get tested. got first test back within 13 hours! even capital. Part second hand info, though take grain salt.

First, lot pressure least try open. Many people need learn trial error, simply won‚Äôt fine remaining closed unless try. are.

Second, second hand info; Salary teachers won‚Äôt get paid unless school year starts. friend mine told wife simply waiting first day get going collect salary. that, hoping gets closed quickly.

Most teachers want closed room bunch potential, likely, virus carriers. actually may possible pandemic. simply don‚Äôt know yet, seems quickly figuring out. Sad must suffer Pandemic 101.

On side note ‚Äî you‚Äôre teacher need help with; Zoom, live broadcasting general, audio, video, graphics course work‚ÄîReach privately.

I‚Äôll take time get going need, refer another could help well. I‚Äôve working broadcasting industry 3 years would glad help people getting remote learning setting. pity testing quick plenty --- affordable everyone.

Could students faculty tested days prior start school catch cases like second grader test shortly school started regular testing that.

Could made requirement test members student's family too.

Would perfect --- look MLB plentiful tests day turn around.

On hand, schools re-open, might enough infections throughout enough families make everyone understand COVID-19 hoax impact everyone.  Maybe that's real plan here. /s next press briefing "" listen folks need download app called Plague Inc, play shit learn something."" Boston Marathon bombers killed TWO entire city united like I've never seen before. get wrong, terrorism absolutely despicable bomber definitely punished. where's unity deaths thousands? see non-maskers Boston area still. They'll import ""scabs"" Kentucky, treats teachers *even worse.* like asbestos analogy. don‚Äôt know health children, person, became statistical blip. used matter whether people lived died (or permanently maimed). think need go medication honestly believe that. Using logic, God gave us Coronavirus lmao think save particular. That‚Äôs without school session. statistical information death rate shoving back tiny, overcrowded rooms together. I'm sympathetic view. consider they'll take home potentially expose less young healthy people. ....and they're making wear masks.

So irresponsible.

Can stop following suggestions people want diminish downplay risks? actually medical condition prevent wearing mask. written pathological, would correct. read see someone said already, Texas, least TRY open that's educational gods said do. Everyone knows going go, least say tried. Silly, yes. Sad, yep. may die risk I‚Äôm willing take! heard severity infection related amount virus. smaller amount, easily tolerated illness; lot virus system, symptoms severe. possible one wishful thinking ideas? fuck yammerin now? People idiots.

People general get works, infection events. People see Memorial Day 4th July, week later giant outbreak, say ""See, everything fine"". get actually works like this:

1. Infection event (July 4th, example). People get infected, they're first carriers.

2. 2 weeks symptoms show up, walk around asymptomatic spreading others. (we're July 18th)

3. another 2 weeks SECOND wave starts getting sick. Meanwhile, they're spreading third wave. (we're August 1st)

4. another 2 weeks THIRD wave starts getting sick, wave actually start seeing numbers positive cases really start going up. (we're August 15th)

5. now, deaths single digits, enough people infected, getting critically sick, going ICU, dying. get third wave though (where hundreds thousands people getting sick) that's FINALLY start seeing double-digit deaths per day higher...but almost 2 months initial infection event.

With schools/colleges opening early September, possible (even likely) see bad outbreaks least mid-October. since young people asymptomatic higher rate adults, possible we'll seeing stealth transmission while. might see really bad results September decision mid-to-late October. answer corona staring us right face. Antifa masses groups 100k shown spread single case corona.

We must classes middle downtown streets kids burn things tear statues. Don‚Äôt forget certain elected official pushed lie pandemic hoax shocking number people fell would 'Make' school happen long term home? probably certain students home industry creates platform this. right balance needed hybrid style could perfect opening schools ludicrous.  [The county YMCA outbreak happened outlined approach 're-opening' schools. ""Children required wear mask"" stated repeatedly. sending kids death trap.   ""It is."" morning commute almost back whole shit show. schools area opening up, people send kids private schools sending in. That's distance learning unless ordered to. Surprise surprise lot voucher kids amongst population means keep voucher kid going school. 

The public schools poor quality due lack funding losing access voucher program would harm kids chances. Granted family die thing. parents great situation. Yes, aware. Places like Duke, Yale, even Liberty held examples places function without state support. Right! case, remote cases go town, testing improves. 1)Some reports claiming antibodies produced probably fade away sometime hence infected again,with perspective effective vaccine be?? many doses need?

If fail making vaccine within year ,are going back normal? long take make another vaccine starting first?

Btw health experts collaborated economic experts Columbia University? many countries living relatively normal lives already USA obviously greatest country universe could situation worse? Maybe minority people listen Trump Co., yes. 

But us, feel extremely powerless depressed. nice see someone gets it. inability react pandemic (in pretty much every G7 country) inflexible capitalist economies designed around consumerism shareholder returns rather needs human beings. Yes actually could... unless unfortunately part 0.05% can‚Äôt. purposely dense? headline need imply that. implication child COVID already school. literally matter caught it, already subjected children teachers illness. give till end September every single school opened closes due many staff students getting sick. Even optimistic. Many probably close middle September. ShockedPikachu.jpeg tried looking data? /This administration taps forehead headline say got school, made inference. could well read inferring kid spreading school. spoke boss‚Äôs boss today learned exactly many employees directly affected COVID deaths.

We employ fewer 150 people.

One employee passed away. Someone‚Äôs mother passed away. Someone‚Äôs grandmother also passed away.

If speak 10 people, least one either directly affected it. hospital getting surgery also test? Many hospitals testing gear sort use. Same. myth ""social distancing"" effective closed classroom poor ventilation closed doors 90 minute period laughable graveyard humor sort way.  
The ridiculous belief teenage clodhoppers going stay rooms, party, avoid intimate encounters strangers, honest ""honors system"" school place (take temperature every morning pinky-swear feel okay), gonna play much like imagine.  
And student body composed primarily ""student athletes"" going team practices laughably lax bubbling...this gonna fucking train wreck epic proportions. 

In town, school going responsible biggest mass-migration event year. vast majority students coming California Texas, shit's gonna get REAL real three weeks. case define whether online learning actually less valuable person learning. hold person classes only, people demand remote option due safety. remote option, equivalent credit given someone attending remotely? get credits less? issue simple.  definitely risk hospitals become overloaded significant number flu cases top COVID cases. chance flu infections could relatively number winter U.S. Although American's compliance mandates wear masks maintain social distancing leaves lot desired, chance precautions also limit spread flu.

I cannot lay hands article, believe read last week Australia New Zealand (where winter ended) saw far fewer cases flu usual. Both, course much better U.S. maintaining COVID precautions, maybe cause hope. think ultimate security theatre powerwashing outside subway cars. School August? Jebus you‚Äôre touchy. Yes, sponsored Raid: Shadow Legends  gasoline

To give actual analogy people relate to. 0 children died far California, state 40 million people. would say doomers start singing different tune presented raw data, fear mongering reality never stop. Yeah that's true too; oil gas hardest hit industries first month think Swedish industries hit hard (it rebounded since). difficult find similarly insulated economies Sweden, nation nation basis always find differences. get trouble sending kids school. immense pressure places go people send kids. parent spent last year terrified (my kids got sick lot). genuinely worried district going file report me. get much immunity covid, antibodies stay around long get seasonal flu.

each every day, learn long term effects covid, even young even even show symptoms.

worst case, generation children, contracted covid point life, might lose years life expectancy road. [The county YMCA outbreak happened outlined approach 're-opening' schools. ""Children required wear mask"" stated repeatedly. sending kids death trap. Maybe need emotional support dogs get trauma wearing mask. Whatever takes get assholes wear one. important thing see get mentioned lot need protect eyes well, ACE2 receptors like nose throat support contraction COVID. addition wearing mask sanitizing, need wear face shield goggles protect eyes droplets airborne particles. Good. same, everything can't washed sink wiped alcohol (including mail xD). months it, I'm going risk it. Besides, know dirty stuff is, virus not, think I'm going stop, ever. Yeah America sucks haha page one. feel like I'm person still pandemic. done anything since March, neighbors friends giving shit now. get reallllll shitty soon. Can't wait see spin massive amounts dead kids be.

So? bad though, even loses half brain function he'd still places ahead you. forget ""being white"" list. Without that, American history. Clearly people can't bothered care families, service industry workers, medical professionals, school aged kids, elderly, cancer patients, poor. Fuck anyone mindset. killing us. would thought American owned website American created computer network would talking America? Maybe country creates internet, websites, dominate conversation. seems work North Korea. definitely speak government it. We‚Äôre already tired influence anyway. got antigen test day took 15 minutes find hard believe. specifically say keeping middle seats open end October. families still sit together, perhaps that‚Äôs saw? masks, I‚Äôve flown Southwest several times recently strict masks. School august? Absolutely. People would ask before, ""why dont go senior center?"" Nope. store block live on. They've never gone there. even grab newspaper. say lockdowns spread virus people go crazy. That‚Äôs criminal negligence.

This common co-morbidity disease. told much help unless sick learned contagion process. know mandatory. sure people think updating recommendations based new evidence supposed bad thing. I'm thinking depopulation lottery. dumbass CDC info detected COVID-19 11.8% household contacts; rates higher contacts children adults. risks largely reflected transmission middle mitigation therefore might characterize transmission dynamics school closure

We also found highest COVID-19 rate (18.6% [95% CI 14.0%‚Äì24.0%]) household contacts school-aged children

And also ""default situation"" children sent back school, welfare also protect working parents ""downstream ripple effects"" children home.
""But big 'however,'"" said¬†Fauci, stating safety, health welfare children, teachers personnel ""paramount."" one size fits solution, said.
Fauci¬†said answers many questions regarding schools re-opening remain unknown. ""In many respects, unfortunately, though may sound little scary harsh, mean way, going actually part experiment, learning curve, need know. Gotta beads though...I mean.

Doesn't make snitch? early-February brought PPE Toronto, one last stores available. made China.

Now, might anecdotal piece evidence, given China's early lead creating PPE status world's largest manufacturer general, would expect vast majority Canada's PPE came China. factories would need paid fortune (the orders still require get paid) amount construction certification required, say nothing knowledgeable staff, etc, would extreme. take long time. Probably north year.

You understand works then. paid fortune act. Trump used tens thousands times, btw, testing/PPE. 

And btw, would cost far, far less out-of-control cost note backed using DPA. Probably manufacturers explained, ""this something know it'll cost fortune also slow happen"".

Or Trump decided want testing, keeps say, over. CDC know party people blithely assume parents afford babysitter look kids entire school year retired/stay home family/friends happy free!

Nevermind assumption everyone language/ literacy skills broadband connection/computers help child distance learming.

Hell bring successful alumni like Mark Zuckerberg, founders Lyft etc talk weekly. attended UWS undergrad, night day difference terms advantages get.

The education different right terms material, 100x different terms delivered, really makes huge difference terms digested. Also, student body / peers huge contributing factor strong academic environment. kids brightest world go onto becoming future founders, leaders one day. absolutely makes difference surround kinds people converse intellectually them. lot personal growth.

Well say MUST true right? 

Just like known child rapist. Fauci also said people wearing masks, fuck \*1 day. fixed you. r/nottheonion no, going work within next years. stopped even persuading take back home. 

I believe many wealthy families value comfort anything else. especially 'kids danger'... mean agree really option looking for? basically options different state honestly grateful online even option. know still used med-tech, right? diagnosed moved hospital.

It asked home imprisonment, since asthma. mean politicians ordinary people? Cuz people definitely do. Stochastic terrorism, right here.  bet lot people may children undiagnosed sort mental disorder like ADHD autism. would certainly easy. Personally, well kids. think could surround day everday 18 years (minimum) straight. could look getting Wacom tablet, I‚Äôve used one like $75 years took couple hours get used writing tablet looking screen. bets house long schools completely shut again. I‚Äôm TN curious they‚Äôll even tell us student it.  hate ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù could misleading article / fake news. Yeah, think beginning intubation go treatment, knew little cytokine storms.

I think time improve treatments keeping hospitals overflowing pretty much things lockdowns bought us fronts, like testing example, feel like progress made. I'm lockdowns, I'm saying government appears wasted time lockdown. live Maine required negative test within 3 days getting vacation. super low numbers apparently tons tourists contacting local hospitals found positive getting here.

Most asymptomatic got tests required we're shocked come back positive. thought process keeping population safe *disease* politicized framed terms restricting freedoms absolute dummies thoughts prayers brigade.

Like invisible line certainty virus targets, effects outcomes. Like additional intense studies need done confirm *wearing mask* reduce spread. 

But trust criminally inclined republican controlled government fuck everyone - continuous wars, mismanaged economy corruption, poor health outcomes, poor education, poor foreign policy - complete failure leadership across board. Wait what's wrong hanging mask rear view mirror USA never implemented national strategy. Yeah concern ones can‚Äôt afford miss paycheck. won‚Äôt able strike. stay. ones currently work need job go it.

wan sand tizer drinkee poo think want make point could least present downsides.

The downsides certainly include children who‚Äôs parents don‚Äôt give shit whether need daily. lack socializing peers age. Different people learn differently.

Lives saved economic benefit. we've returned age foresight valued economic value long term subservient short term. What's alternative? 

It *never* possibility keep schools closed extended period time. 

1. Proper socialization young children far important overall wellbeing future health outcomes avoiding coronavirus. Biologically speaking, brains critical development learning phases paramount get properly socialized exposed world. Children least risk category, probably going symptoms light symptoms, shutting schools COVID would equivalent shutting schools seasonal flu. 

2. young kids cannot left alone home, childcare insanely expensive supply meet demand, parents choose either going work taking care kids, savings depleted alarming rates.

3. Practice proper etiquette. kids wear masks school stop spread, wear home contact parents. Teach kids sneeze/cough elbow well wearing masks. Regularly washing hands, sneezing/coughing elbows, wearing masks greatly reduces spread.

**With said, applies kindergarden-elementary school aged kids. Middle school later left home alone learn online sacrifice school year greater public good.** course I‚Äôm person asking, RN cared covid positive, here‚Äôs do. lots hand sanitizer, keep doors open, wear hair coverings (can use reusable wash every day), immediately take scrubs hat home put washer. Wipe shoes sort alcohol sanitizing wipe/spray, leave shoes car garage. Shower immediately home. Try touch/take mask little possible.   WTF wrong you, trying defend NY? literally deaths *by huge margin*. Cuomo royally fucked up. astounds many people praise him. [UN Officials Cite Study Finds Lockdowns, School Closures KILLING Children Here's Florida's latest case/death charts, running 7-day currently 33.68 total deaths per 100k population. That's 18th highest among states. first state 2+ weeks test results. 6 weeks later heard opened testing stations. able schedule drive test time. results 14 hours later. i'm guessing combination gearing enough places able it, choosing simpler test easier/quicker/cheaper do. can't accept learning sports can't happen moment? Jfc. Instead, balloon proportions last winter seemed like child's play. People seem forget vaccine sure thing. I'm done level stress. Probably going tune school outbreaks begin, head truly can't handle level lunacy more. One EXTREMELY many, deeply flawed one that.

Start article delve it. article meant thing look into, diving point. one test positive one day exposure? completely right, top continuous leadership financial support top. Anyone disagrees uniformed research. Schools long deal irresponsible parents send damn kids school flu symptoms, coughs, fevers, etc. Covid truthers going even worse top normal amount jackasses poor souls can't leave work pick kids sick, sit office hours. Don‚Äôt tell fear mob that. work, school! Free money! get it. govt forcing schools open up? backlash parents? Oh fuck off. CDC changed opinion thing spreads multiple times multiple studies contradict themselves.

Spending little money cleaning least every company could operating pandemic. Idiot. FYI make contact named ‚Äúfucking fuck‚Äù phone it‚Äôs stop correcting duck. shitty funding myth that. Many city public schools among highly funded school districts country. ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù, ok?  PCR takes hours. antibody test something? Yeah evidence meaningful improvement. numbers Florida testing way down.

This actually change ultimate number deaths. positively anyway.  No, average 5 days exposure symptoms, rarely short 2 long 14. People spread virus 2-3 days get symptoms contagious 1-2 days feel sick. R G G E R E wait. get fly testing positive corona virus? lie screeners, screening processes useless? wrap Saran Wrap throw cargo? I've read online teachers kids confined one room teachers ones changing rooms. entire year groups split rest. Still convinced safe though. Bill Gates left chat benefit sacrificing 50 million kids

There is! Won‚Äôt somebody *please* think **economy**? Yup! sarcasm.!&lt; Huh? Teaching saturated field... one vacation RI? effective expect vaccines vs something like influenza. Influenza seems like far greater genetic mutation rates compared corona viruses, shouldn‚Äôt make corona virus vaccine effective vs yearly flu shots? School openened Netherlands spike cases. Fuck education.  Fuck economy. Fuck money.  people absolutely fucking delusional.  None important physical mental well children. NONE IT.

The problem public schools US long children school.  blame federal government refuses invest education teachers like share blame well.  way live way learn changing many made clear going refuse even try make virtual learning work.  said teachers like part problem. woman experienced something similar. spent lot time working earlier felt like would year really put there. sudden I'm supposed come within 6 ft another person foreseeable future. Wtf Mother Nature?! large sample size. small one got Emergency Use Approval showed reduction hospitalization duration. They‚Äôre still running large sample size study Yep, size AC room certain amount time infect everyone. Optimized circulation. actually learned lot, kind appreciate lengths research verbal spars people gone me. I'm amused get two cents buddy Learn read sweetheart. say things. Wait, thought wasn‚Äôt supposed happen? Wow actually really exciting news! wonder accurate implications 50% people might existing immunoresponse.  Exactly! never tested anyone. we'd corona free! moved symptoms don‚Äôt seem typical COVID (cough mostly productive sore/irritated throat seems caused drainage, example) I‚Äôve lived parents symptoms neither got me. gotten negative test result, furniture apartment gone dad coming back plane trip Monday, felt like move boyfriend Sunday. 

I also OCD aspects hypochondria, gut instincts likely someone else infected virus usually wrong.

And distancing plan, wasn‚Äôt plan. got close decided moment probably ok based described ease it, since we‚Äôve living mostly normal. said, sleeping separate rooms. May rest peace. sounds noble idk, really delaying inevitable?

Yes. parents let children mix outside school quarantined groupsl, one thing.

Source: UK opened schools 6 weeks school holidays, among problems.  purpose, Phase 3 see vaccine effective people general population. hope get infected naturally see it‚Äôs effective. brilliant idea. teachers considering quitting virus concerns, actual viable path least income staying safe.

I idea might work, seems like huge market online tutors. Given choice teaching school holding online tutoring session, know would do.

And tutors may actually earn money, per hour, teachers classroom. Maybe someone chime experience area, seems like opportunity parents, students, tutors. Yep Yeah.. pneumonia deaths still readily added pandemic goes on. anything hide know it'll come eventually. long hidden november LOL one saying is. We‚Äôre acknowledging nuance sides. try time. find sensitivity specificity COVID-19 tests?

I‚Äôm getting COVID-19 test want best accuracy. visited Quest Diagnostics website [their data don‚Äôt give actual values sensitivity specificity. Anyone know get info? worst thing ever said US president. got mine Saturday tested Friday morning. always super slow May rest peace. Since COVID likes invade lungs, someone smokes COVID (whether know not), second hand smoke contain virus?! another unknown way transmitting virus, since smoke travel pretty far, much 6 feet?! ABSOLUTELY. We‚Äôve seen 3 new pathogenic coronaviruses emerge past 20 years (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). 24 25 different families viruses potential human pathogens, include viruses don‚Äôt know circulating wildlife reservoirs. Viruses emerge ecosystems disrupted species brought together new ways, occurs frequently due changing land use climate change. Add increased mobility global society, potential epidemics pandemics novel emerging re-emerging viruses. Pandemic preparedness absolutely crucial. need invest levels: basic research, countermeasure development, ecological studies, modeling, policy. need invest now, don‚Äôt handle next one badly we‚Äôve handled one (at least US).

\-ALR good visual analogy giant fucking explosion took place yesterday. never pay fines spot GER. Personal info recorded get letter days after. Maybe sort federal funding support citizens times crisis. government simply money though. consider economy must remain intact! somebody please think billionaires??  live?? happen swimming pools? happen yachts?? military?! JESUS CHRIST WOULD DEFUND MILITARY?! SOMEBODY THINK BATTLESHIPS?!?! SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK DOW JONES. YES KILL CHILDREN STONKS!!!!! Smart though. People even acknowledge people dying C19 dying C19, always something person going die anyway C19 hoax nothing dying, course. way would willing acknowledge long term symptoms would thing. Oooh ducklings!!! think classes person anywhere US, primary, secondary, university level. 

Thank stating that! example unabashed ignorance is, continue be, reason many necessary deaths across country. 

Sincerely, fuck you. childrens' parents grandparents risk this. spoiler alert: they're not

Wow husband deadbeat? knew test would take six ten days get back point getting it?

Let's back minute.

You're either taking test believe it, believe exposed it.

If believe virus (hence test): also self quarantining yourself, contacting may exposed, same. outcome test change others (post answer), important step slowing spread.

The folly others falling into: waiting results test changing habits. ""Why self quarantine know not?"" -- common fallacy. Upstate new York country. Well yeah, that‚Äôs politics country. bunch greedy children. Corrupt politicians. Fake news. No, all. important let Herman Cain's death (and responsible it) fall memory hole. 50 states point? I'm confused, student attends school Day 1 tests positive Day 2.. 

Sounds like may school started, no? course, back ""science"" masks work countries solving problem masks. think schools try something cross fingers effective. Considering success NY flattening curve social distancing wearing masks, schools also pursuing 'half / half off' measure they'll dealing half capacity. Let's see happens. call Divine Intervention. using ""pee pool"" were. amount taxes, rather misappropriation. Americans taxed guarantee money would go toward building bombs fighter jets instead toward helping people. Aren‚Äôt schools spread thought? virus spreading even easier? That‚Äôs headline said. coInCiDaNcE since it‚Äòs going wh I'm tired dream now...

That's many people dying despite fact we've gotten pretty good treating coronavirus now. That's look bad compared countries. whose fault again? Oh right, his. 

Of course, would ridiculous interviewer belabor point it'd take another 15 minutes get nowhere questions needs ask. man wish would've. obvious that's getting Trump nowhere near it. Really hope trickles universities. vet school (52k/yr) switched online lost labs w/out reimbursement (so 1st yr students get dissect/learn anatomy w/ large animal cadavers, 2nd yrs get practice spays/neuters/anesthesia/inpatient care, 3rd yrs lost large animal palpation/anesthesia/junior surgery/internal med).  also feel like general quality education comparable regular learning....they really put forms learning/more stress independent study opposed making everything open book. mess.

All second look look closer signifier accomplishment (and things) matches up. Yep, pretty ""entrepreneurial"" loot taxpayers $1.6 million pandemic. class war plain simple. Keep us distracted fighting turn them. good. loving WNBA wubble. Last week best felt months. Ouch.... soon?? ;-) thing talking backfire massively. projections put Texas Florida NY levels deaths months they're including things like opening schools. 

Its like people care Covid South Midwest surged kept talking cases falling cases rose, kept tlaking deaths falling deaths rose agree you! would never frame health issue x number 9/11s. I'm going tell old am, nice try. applaud condescending end absolutely reason.

Funny read said nasty response, anyways, 

I said....people said many many many times loose handkerchief real mask ""concerned"" people wearing (I put concerned quotations reads like virtue signalling rather real alarm).

So one saying OK. reason think saying everyone walking eggshells around protesters. Ignoring curfews, fine. Looting, fine. Breaking windows, fine. Tearing statues, fine. wearing masks, pretend never happened. Wearing half-assed mask, OK long protesting. 

Can hold everyone standard? live couple minutes school. high-school friends high-school ended news too. I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt go school anymore. I‚Äôve felt powerless it‚Äôs freaking depressing. feel like US we‚Äôre floundering election, granted could well boat come November 4. I‚Äôve everything right assholes decide they‚Äôre bored go bar bunch people. Guess I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôm putting people risk Inner City ? They‚Äôre Boston? 

We know inner city schools poorly performing cases / areas, produce educated, cultured, thoughtful kids. Could use spending? teachers? Better schools? Better food? Better community engagement? Sure. forgot mention blacks. HORRIFYING many reasons. I‚Äôm glad dad didn‚Äôt get Covid (or anything else). Damn...... exactly happen. Identify infected kids send home infecting others. took husband 13 days Florida get results. already feeling better time got them. Contact tracing would useless time could actually tell people it. said wearing mask day would mentally scar yourself. lot parents dodoheads 'tired' parental responsibilities basically. whining 'they take care child day', like thats exact responsibility took :x 


I guess read fine-print becoming parent? :D lol Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists. live Blount County includes Maryville Alcoa school systems. Blount County schools also positive cases 2 schools. Roughly 20-25% students system enrolled virtual learning.

This going work. Parents fits staggered schedules, sending children school waiting test results, think ""just flu"" hoax. governor considers ""nationwide experiment."" mayor issue mask mandate ""personal responsibility."" community screwed. Thank you

Virus bacteria get sick. virus high death rate close everything awhile control political bullshit. government control people‚Äôs hands now. Everyone knows high risk dying. let things course proper management social distancing whatever else people believe god created everything believe science god?

He write code shit science figuring lines it. ironic divisive figure fueling unity really hope people acting like room temperature IQ think improves chances Trump losing next election November stop trying equate teen's positive Covid result Beirut explosion. Probably open mind instead jerking echo chamber tribal ideas.

Gotta imagine place ideas sides mingling would harder troll. 90 days election day, everyone Denmark able reopen kinds things US can't safely reopen. MAY 26 swift response seems paid off. Covid-19 cases plummeted, Denmark last month became first EU nation reopen primary schools. restaurants, hairdressers, shops, museums zoos followed what's point? Maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy employer won‚Äôt give leave without positive test, go keep job‚Äù ‚Äúthe school won‚Äôt give additional absences remote resources positive test kid still go‚Äù. Would rather kill family kill family bunch people collateral? Again, understand difficult conceptually. easy decision clear harm good. point either situation family dies. way probably end evicted matter get sick (not IF) working. disabled working, die certainly working, kids die disabled never able forgive yourself. Either way address point stated obvious analogy. Honest reason I'm seriously considering moving another country better grasp situation. unusual advice little kids? parents used give us electrolyte popsicles sick. medicine too, course Great points - I‚Äôm interested learning this. wasn‚Äôt aware tuition tiered based number credits take. undergrad large public university standard flat rate per credit (at least, attended) makes sense - idea, guess, students enrolled courses likely use larger share campus resources. 

Currently, attend pricey private institution grad school don‚Äôt know tuition billed (PhD students department tuition waived). guess, case, students sold complete package, either use resources don‚Äôt. guess solution might involve educational packages opt certain things (I never use career center let opt that, example). think turns slippery slope where, say, merit-based scholarships pay base price, putting promising students disadvantage they‚Äôre independently wealthy. thought takes couple days test positive, it. 

Unless before. dogs come contact humans. collect odor samples test using specialized containers. Odor samples armpit sweat, I‚Äôve also seen urine, used socks, masks discussed. 

Dogs get virus general seen mild symptoms cases dying infecting human. could true... models showed could take 20% infected get herd immunity T-cell immunity conferred Coronaviruses. We'd obviously want duplicated analyzed extensively let shape public policy, would miraculous news.

Also, huge disservice acknowledging limitations knowledge. always possible something like could happen, though vanishingly small risk high would absolutely foolish base public policy possibility. idea herd immunity may achievable without death toll initially thought make anti-lockdown, anti-science, inevitably anti-vax people right... They're still reckless, selfish morons.  mean, fairness, Tuskegee. blame minorities skeptical experimental medicine. Closing distanced learning win.  shit nature job allows come go day (sans scheduled meetings). days take several hours work evening great sometimes hard time disconnecting. I'm Chicago can't wait till city realizes provide high-speed internet devices every kid. Lol start paying bill never going back in-person learning schools cut least 50% teaching positions would ever need many teachers online even taught live entire day Oops. Thanks pointing out. Edited. 

But, yes, outside, USA seems focused politics personal opinions anything else. rather point fingers unite work together common goal squashing common ""enemy"".

With internal battles going on, title *United* States becoming oxymoron.... Children get less sick, mean spread infection other, public transit families.

More evidence emerging case schools open countries like Israel US.

Here Sweden test children even schools teachers got sick died, know might spread infection. mean, literally applies first class job. 90% america still go day labor job. crazy, could seen coming???

Ohhh, everyone. Right. problem thinking people making decisions actually thinking. recall reading anywhere lower levels viral replication sinuses indicative infectiousness.

If ""negative"" tests give false confidence person safe, disastrous results.

Rapid point-of-use testing made available almost always used wrong way: try pretend building/employer safe people test way in. Inevitably, leads reduction elimination infection controls caution within facility inevitably infectious party slips through. thing I've wondering --and purely spec-- percentage people apparently asymptomatic actually unrecognized neurological symptoms? one goes hospital personality changes poor memory. end looking children whose brains still growing? could effective, say 50%, would big impact overall illness death. wouldn‚Äôt want roll dice individual.

I'd argue would fine ""roll dice"" individual case. terms large numbers 50% reduction transmission vectors may seem like lot (going 100-50 town example) terms individual, 50% already small chance becoming severely ill quite significant normalizing daily routines. important understand individual susceptibility cannot looked terms large numbers used studies different individual cases are. example, live county \~10 cases less total reported day 400K people, chance coming contact sick individual low, look view large numbers instead, 10 people could infect 5 people assume come contact say-100 people average, people 5 infect 5 people etc. etc., mean risk necessarily changed before. Can't make IV chemo time. feel like death cancer would easier less rapid chemo + covid. FATIGUE INTERNAL DAMAGE rule, exception. think fact they've failed badly could result actual reform.

If playing evil mastermind would fully funded unemployment whenever someone future goes ""unemployment broken"" point corona success. gutting completely. part endemic confusing people? Glad see many governors feel safe absolutely nothing letting world crumble around them. Mine, too. ugh Kids spread germs. spread joy gumdrop smiles shiny rainbows......  





/s district decided remote learning yesterday. happy decision lot fools Facebook today, whining telling everyone they're pulling kids district charter private schools school board ""gave fear teachers."" gotta improve long term solvency social security medicare somehow. Killing old people certainly ""solution"". guess referring actual danger virus. also seem one worst responses world. feels like there's entire party paying attention, claiming they're smarter ""fall globalist scams"" you. decision move away Georgia seems better every day. think turn another false positive test result.

39,673 people left Taiwan time entered countries require COVID-19 tests upon arrival. 3 tested positive. Statistically, that's easily within false positive test rate.

The Japanese girl false positive. negative second test, negative antibodies, 100+ contacts Taiwan negative.

The Belgian guy likely Covid back Belgium March. tested positive IgG antibodies, IgM, indicating past infection. 441 contacts Taiwan tested negative PCR antibodies.

The Thai worker another false positive. again, 189 contacts Taiwan tested negative PCR antibodies. re-tested Thailand, surely negative. feasible guy positive give people lived worked with. Fully, person, measures socially distance? Yes lmao Nice exactly answer question, find total excess deaths state. Seems imply moderate undercounting, maybe huge undercounting.

AUSTIN (KXAN) ‚Äî Claudia Bertaud always ready dance.

‚ÄúAnytime anyone would play music would start dancing, loved much,‚Äù Linda Vasquez, daughter, explained. ‚ÄúShe loved dancing, favorite thing. Everyone always remembered dancing.‚Äù

The 48-year-old really enjoyed dancing norte√±as, especially playlist included songs favorite band, La Maquinaria Nortena. It‚Äôs memories Vasquez holds Bertaud passed away COVID-19 complications end July.

‚ÄúUnfortunately body wasn‚Äôt strong enough fight virus completely took whole body,‚Äù Vasquez said.

The Spanish immersion preschool teacher INIC Preschool south Austin stopped going work early last month developed cough. Soon, Bertaud began experience loss appetite, sleepless nights shortness breath.

‚ÄúHer symptoms seemed mild quickly escalated,‚Äù said.

Vasquez said believes mother‚Äôs Rheumatoid arthritis may played role.

Bertaud waited 12 days going area hospital south Austin. family said Bertaud needed ventilator, hospital available, transferred hospital Lakeway. that, airlifted transferred hospital Temple.

Bertaud placed medically-induced coma. Vasquez said doctors told family lack oxygen caused severe damage Bertaud‚Äôs brain, meant may never wake again.

‚ÄúShe always said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want live life like go way,‚Äô unfortunately went way,‚Äù said.

Vasquez believes mom got virus family.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed us Hispanics, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs nothing, it‚Äôs cough, I‚Äôm sick.‚Äô It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù said.

For Vasquez, sadly, last conversation mom COVID-19 turned argument.

‚ÄúI sad ended bad terms,‚Äù Vasquez said holding back tears. ‚ÄúI wish could dance least one time. miss lot.‚Äù

Five days Bertaud passed away, Vasquez said family received call hospital let family know hospital bill $14,000. Vasquez believes final bill helped generate $25,000 Wednesday morning. family also pay funeral, family isn‚Äôt sure be. extra money, use create college fund Bertaud‚Äôs youngest daughter 11 years old. hope things eventually turn you. Stay strong. wait, arent even isolating? LOL. shits hilarious. meanwhile soccer leagues using bubble concept playing month issues someone actually lives New York:

No. self-righteous. 

I read article. That's issue. many people think ignoring stupid people what's best them, sending covid positive kid school. clicked link first comment shows week fell 8% (based 4,804 tests, previous week 11%).
Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations dropped 4%. ICU beds COVID patients dropped 3%. (Overall ICU bed usage dropped 83% 82%). Ventilators use COVID dropped 4%. Intubations Respiratory Distress stayed triple digits (70).
Data Fair point. State governments could order people regardless, states, Governors could act unilaterally. state legal restriction state government imposing restrictions due public health emergencies. Lmao sole world superpower can't afford come loads shitty little countries can. gonna throw there... Elementary schools online learning falls heavily parents shoulders child focus what's necessary. high school students able handle themselves. College definitely able navigate work ease. 


There lot single parents can't afford job younger (elementary) kids academic situation would suffer greatly, assuming childcare available incapable taking schooling responsibilities course. single parents would fail miserably, lot places country feasible survive without 2 full-time earning incomes.


It seems youngest school aged kids would suffer greatly. 


That said, homeschooling child year. currently taking online training courses work online work homeschooling cannot zero income spread United States, contact tracing longer possible many States means real thing US mitigate spread wait vaccine. rarely Why? He's writing attack ads himself. I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs budget, that‚Äôs option makes reasonable return school. don‚Äôt money schools stay shut down. virus gonna spread fucking quick schools reopen it‚Äôs gonna take long.  NY'er here, also feeling relatively positive are. Mask compliance/social distancing pretty solid neighborhood.  I'd say indoors 95% outdoors 80%ish. long positive % stays low need people careful time.

Construction back, local restaurants/bars made far getting closer normal volume, better open streets program. 

I hope/think sustainable November luck we'll vaccine proven safe/effective. point business owners might bunker till spring completely different scenario able game expect closer ""normal"" incredible uncertainty past 6 months..

Without doubt epic disaster city recovered disaster time time again, we'll get this. School precursor good mental health assertion missing school causes reduction life expectancy preposterous.  Guaranteed, people telling workers ""suck up"" people safely working home. He's talking hair. 24.7% world's prisoners seems bit... excessive?

Heh. Yeah. is. 26.2% world's Covid-19 cases also seems little excessive me. become increasing common younger late 1940s early 2000s, prevalence shingles among Americans younger 50 quadrupled, Harpaz‚Äôs data shows. research suggests incidence shingles among younger adults may actually gaining steam. least anecdotally, shingles seems increasingly common among people twenties thirties ‚Äî group that, historically, suffered vanishingly low rates live Fulton county. closed schools back March, they‚Äôre continuing keep schools closed. least two schools siblings going to.

I know Cherokee county is. GED testing there. It‚Äôs conservative hellhole. It‚Äôs quite ironically called Cherokee county people live would tell indigenous people ‚Äúgo back country‚Äù. surprised opened back up. I‚Äôm staying Fulton. Yeah, that's terrible. I'm sorry deal that. defense, transitioning online format go incredibly hard. Given summer prep, classes could every bit good person classes. 

Of course, social dynamic still missing. can't understated. Connections peers one-on-one relationships professors much harder develop. terms material actually learned classroom, online formats *can* effective. Good know, thank you. might look see there's one little thicker made specifically COVID ears always pain days. long term consequences within children's lives?

Especially socio-economically disadvantaged children rely time primary school lay foundation escape situation? also probably led many kids infected school one day. Yea, need flexible, lot *aren't*. ""space"" speak of? Tbf nipples breast plate would nice distraction. Would catch eye every slowing opponent. concentrate people camps...  lucky enlightened dickhead hours waste teach us invaluable lesson. 

Thank sacrifices. guess CDC wrong listing it? might want little research. elementary schools HVAC set windows teachers head could open long stick think. Simple that. Something spoon fed media someone else accepted move on. basically whole process here. think much it'll give headache. reasoning. Open schools likely end badly. Israel double digit new infections per day. reopened schools they're back thousand new infections per day, ther successes erased.

Details here: clue country debts actually are. thought didnt get results fast course can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre built social distancing. Neither infrastructure culture. doctor government predicts ‚Äùsocially distance 3-4 years‚Äù. Obviously doesn‚Äôt understand humanity. changed three times 1-6. Small school though, weren‚Äôt teachers. come 7-9 rumor got strict teacher klassf√∂rest√•ndare. don‚Äôt know contribute useless piece information tell kids devils. 6yr old daughter sounds similar. let left alone, ever. Even get something room wants someone go her. Looking child psychologist help out.

I mean lightly say hard work challenging. general attitude parents around tone use... though really hate parent. 

It's everyone deciding kids make someone 'bad person'. truly believe everyone honestly wish people would think kids. Yep. monitors that? honor system? access card tied to? give copy test result? who? approved centers print own? places opened already shutting back down. Media talking much though. source this, want use future argument, people keep telling terrible job cause spike nursing home. lol. ""we'll see happens"" think people weary going get tests poor state testing been. Everyone know who's gotten tested non-covid procedure test known potential exposure. There's effort test sake finding asymptomatic carriers know of. confused there's even 1 case shut school sanitize everything. 




























So anymore going shut open schools rest year. I've heard thing claimed obesity. Every time person dies sub, swear blamed obesity. Obesity factor cases geez. I'm sure would help long run.

It would stop initial spread, someone got Rona weekend came school it, test beginning school anything. 

Also I've always thought teachers get paid enough doubly so. Thank teaching Good. it. used work super stressful job call center. hated it. quit. badass do. it‚Äôs possible maybe start looking finding rewarding career?

I agree though time spend kids. extremely grateful time get them. parents worked lot keep us fed housed. didn‚Äôt ability spend much time us girls. 

I feel like lot people grass always greener... except people working office jobs. jobs suck. can't take credit shit - mostly # people would *give* credit is, rightly, dwindling rapidly 41% country. Coincidentally I'm going share news article work hospital nashville. takes 45 minutes big ass machine complete test. honestly dont know takes others days results Exactly.

They'll shocked learn herd immunity simply long term work without vaccine however, unless sudden die-off people course virus prolongs death long even possible. way people refusing wear masks stay inside ones bitching first place. would 16% IQ 85.

Sorry loss grandad. Fair enough glad kids right now. feel bad parents deal nightmare.

But work university I'm also holding breath. honestly wonder thought process is. didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd last couple days, can‚Äôt win. one win. We‚Äôre losing.


Every country done decent job COVID cohesive, centralized plan highest level government scientist/healthcare experts. federal government left fate whatever local officials charge, sent tons mixed messages approach situation. yeah, we're completely fucked people zero experience expertise viral pandemics going making critical decisions. Many re-elected primary motivation. EVER going single kid?

And late game worried kid? thinking kid bringing school potentially infecting another kid brings home, live grandma.

If school lately would realize single kid. like cold sweeps thru whole class. closed sites state storm precaution. They're open again. You‚Äôre twisting knots. reliably demonstrated actions shown true feelings virus.

Surprisingly good article. Worth read time.

Quick summary. need accessible cheap rapid testing even sensitive PCR tests. $800 hour class, 3 credit hours week usually minimum, 16 weeks semester. You‚Äôre paying $38,400 one class?

Offit worries vaccine limited efficacy delivered prematurely might give people ‚Äúa false sense protected‚Äù ‚Äúlead serious outbreaks disease.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe wait completion Phase 3 trials, matter long take,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWith luck, could finished six nine months.‚Äù



Look Fauci, get it, don‚Äôt want doubt vaccines work enough people agree take them. trust aren‚Äôt giving us full story? Hospitals make ready-to-use disinfectant wipes used, laundered, re-packed fluid without relying shipping pre-made stuff. really basic technology require everything disposable. simply reconsider wasteful general hospitals need reduce waste possible well. Regardless specific professional uses, really place consumer goods. 100% agree. don‚Äôt care context, wanna come shit guy.  Well don‚Äôt go run tests! Invite kid covid house family. Let know happens!

If don‚Äôt feel like risking that, maybe shut fuck up. Children‚Äôs hospitals taking adult patients hard hit areas. Also, social distancing (per institute disease modeling) reduces pandemic maximum factor 25%.

So 25% reduced chance catch Covid hide house mostly year.

I'll take chances. God would want use intellect bestowed upon make smart choices protect family. warned plagues before. What's deal Florida? positive rates low compared week ago?  Teaching is, frankly, secondary concern many faculty schools.

Not sure saying 'these schools' since true universities general. outside smaller colleges, emphasis research, teaching. Im disappointed fellow Americans... businesses bare minimum legally small businesses multinational corporations. affects many people differently. coworker mother get nothing happened her. mother law died says ""it heart failure covid, put cause death"" I'm done tired talking points. stay south die ding dongs.  TL;DR U.S., accounts less 5% world population, leads countries global coronavirus infections deaths. nation represents 22% [global coronavirus 25% infections Wednesday, according Johns Hopkins University data. schools plan won‚Äôt shut 5% students staff test positive. plans actually test anyone - would mean enough people volunteering get tested reporting results back school.

Currently grateful governor shut us down, working site lots unmasked teachers staff. believe Trump threatened pull funding schools open, surprised loophole schools gladly abusing.

I heard someone works education wanted this.  Yep. 50% effective enough. vaccines coming appear way better even that. Tolerance finest /s

But seriously, multiple studies indicating children (under 15 years old believe) much much harder infect bodies fewer receptors virus attacks. also show children negligible vectors transmission, don‚Äôt know confirmed cases child passing disease adult Even covid19, school one known virus brewing grounds. reopening schools wait covid 19 much control??? I'm thinking meteor. need absolutely file unemployment. Look CARES act &amp; see applies you. Take time heal &amp; thank goodness ok btw!!! Also, ask doctor fmla asap! job protected even get paid (but unemployment help w/that). Yes, get both!! listen people say otherwise, unprecedented time. File asap! Get well &amp; hope family too!

Edit: give time decide want keep working company fyi waved ""you must look work"" requirement unemployment. Thing ""effective enough"" apparently means ""completely eradicates virus Earth."" havent seen single study started tracking actual impact, prove wrong.  maybe even hurricane! Aww. I‚Äôm soooo shocked! Well, thoughts prayers, thoughts prayers! stop Covid dead tracks!!! averages thousand deaths per day since beginning. Well....if tested them, test positive. (Insert apropriate meme) Slow testing, slow positive test results. Simple that. Lmfao  shocked? No.

Should upset? much so. ""greatest"" one wealthiest countries world, unacceptable. Id argue corona shown much people need school kids time push change parents already worried. people right?

Well everyone agreed say grocery store workers, people home depot. Fuckin states designated alcohol sales state run stores essential. 

But fuck thoae people right? dating app women demand 6' men putting risk more? Great PR believe compliance goes waves. People get scared, start staying home wearing masks distancing more. Cases eventually drop. pattern starts again. People get compliant, cases silently rise critical mass reached ... etc.

I predict point reach high equilibrium slowly oscillates range around 700-1200 deaths day. I‚Äôm East Valley. I‚Äôd say 99% people see grocery store gas stations wear them. It‚Äôs days since I‚Äôve seen someone without mask public. 

2 months ago number like 10%. Well bit complicated that.
I would definitely physical contact whole fiasco blows Shut. Them. Down. twofer nuke both? Look population density age  math isn‚Äôt right. Assuming maybe 10% US it, leaving 300 million infected, would take 8 years infect every American 100,000 new cases day. Even assume 1,000,000 new cases day 6 months still doesn‚Äôt work. nuisance people get infected, harder infect people fast etc. still doesn‚Äôt really make math work. Username checks kind morons they? kids school says literally dozens organizations offering pre-calibrated plans open advice there. months preceding 1987 season, Lightner regarded program's strongest-ever player, recorded 441-pound bench press squatting 756 pounds. 

Jesus Christ that‚Äôs lot. 

Hope beats thing. don‚Äôt think understand inner city chicago public school like haha 2020

It is. Im looking foward moment everything goes even already us üòÇ  Well well well, consequences stupid actions. Schools US really variable start times. start beginning August September. chose let people die rather force lockdown. Scandinavian countries chose less deaths lockdowns cognitive dissonance pocket 

What mean? People paying money? NY highest death rate country. blamed it, instead thankful showed us do.

They significant herd immunity. 

Other places reaching already reached level immunity lot less deaths, learned protecting vulnerable nursing home makes huge difference. honestly wonder thought process is.

It is: *""we need ram politics everyone's throats, make sure win, shape world according view - costs.""*

That's literally it. wasn‚Äôt point, likely spread virus classmates can't believe either. school board meeting yesterday PhD epidemiologist district parent talk challenging be, stressing know enough long term effects children, parents still saying there's risk. 

I'm also amazed parents complaining virtual learning disruptive working parents (which is, get wrong, there's perfect solution here) thinking kid could exposed suddenly home quarantine little notice. would even disruptive everyone, could happen multiple times year, everyone would get pissed again. Yes. Notoriety good press. get shot arm I'm throwing party 200 people would like see anyone try stop me. People realizing unlikely get seriously ill yet we're still treating airborne rabies reason. Tbh actually got bit DC and... didn‚Äôt even realize hurricane. Even NC hurricane like 4th list max 1AUQSNE3JHYpHaJMqEF3r1CLUALzhn7KCd

For amount can.... Thanks.... seat belt choice. medical condition not. South-Korea ready - measures contain SARS made ready. Doesnt surprise all, I've working company's products decade treat thier workforce disposable. intentionally go new grads work half death 5 years repeat. Fauci made fair share mistakes, it‚Äôs sad lot public health officials getting shit significant proportion population. Young people internet &amp; Basic News. Yes know we're supposed wear masks. said literally everywhere........ remember got middle school would eat ravoili pizza rolls red baron pizzas mac / cheese. prior idea. 

I doubt making sandwiches 10 11. impact half truths storm blow covid away disgusting. dudes trying job. guess already people getting jumped vans explanation! It‚Äôs like rain wedding day... RIGHT?! People far stupid keep kid home think might exposed. Either believe fake. 11yo smarter are. told ""Mom, people born idiots. Can't help stupid."" received 1 Dollar 00.1% every bank account US, never work life. well kids, kids. problem everyone compares kids, kids, kids statistic small fraction. problem exponential growth care statistics. 1 kid turns 2, 2 4, Mom Dad whole neighborhood. I'm opening things up, I'm trying conduct business normal possible. love God, let's leave children Adult issues, worry safety first. Education second. I'm Spain, pretty much beat month ago case numbers rapidly approaching saw March. let guard started opening bars, night clubs etc...

This virus definitely 'just going go away'. Europe cases increasing. certainly climb many weeks wasn‚Äôt point, likely spread virus classmates normal mean physical distancing face-masks? Precautions nothing. Wearing masks amount physical distancing sustained years necessary. Don‚Äôt take warning seriously, though. Rich countries get vaccines. both. 

I actually like fact he‚Äôs giving interviews. creates perception transparency. Keeping us updated everyday part job. I‚Äôd worried wasn‚Äôt touch public. hell still eating community food?!!!

I don‚Äôt understand . son goes often treatment inpatient without fail everytime there‚Äôs announcement like ‚Äúpizza! ‚Äú ‚Äúcupcakes break room ! ‚Äú 
I‚Äôm like hold ‚Äî people community food ?!?! Wtf ?! [Positivity rate trending slightly even less dumbass people power evidence last either plenty viruses people lose immunity time. simply don‚Äôt know environment don‚Äôt pretend like last definitively answer question. House must huge. Right, virus massively contagious those.


So yea..wtf. I‚Äôm sarcastic, honestly wonder thought process is. didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd last couple days, open?

Obstinance defiance mainly. Certain political demographics going keep pushing every possible way they're culturally incapable willingly conceding defeat showing *perceived* weakness. matter many people get hurt?

No.

If get hurt, weak; that's fault.

Weakness bad. Open now.

That's literally it. guy clueless poor peoples' attitudes need changing. selfish sending kids school--they literally can't help it. Poor people \*have\* send kids school time go work. already ""work die"" little outside help, pandemic made 10000x worse. little bit airborne ass. I've told let people know dont support Trump lol wish could sue Trump family specifically. May become penniless people stepped years. Pearson much money commonsense comment unfathomable children‚Äôs mental status lot worse bring back disease kills mommy daddy KIds cAnT G3T iT!1!!

honestly fucking sad government leaves teachers staff picture, next month going nightmare :( Purell absent existence suspicious surge pneumonia deaths year  *duck  need emoji straw men Rapid tests used substitute WFH, going force employees show up, still better testing. understand, US antibody tests significantly accurate (90-95%) first-round antibody tests ~70% accuracy, true countries abandoned antibody testing favor scaling PCR testing.

Edit add: r/COVID19_support know, relative California- working man heart condition- got test back day. healthier relatives took little longer get results back. maybe prioritize. That's interesting insight. I'm 6'2"" used get asked grab stuff higher shelves random shoppers grocery. happened though, probably people around respect social distancing.

             Wow Exactly, forget politics apply common sense caution scenarios moment. yea, I'm hopeful outdoor venues end proving generally safe however virus likes operate. honestly sad Medical professional getting death threats job, country gone shit. would pay that? Well put! ""Underlying medical conditions"" one infuriating phrases I've heard past 25 years justify someone's suffering loss. like trying tie ""didn't wear seat belt"" something, like going change fact someone died left hole loss sudden absence. idea 0 cases US kids return school? wait mandatory vaccine? Or....?

At point let kids return school?

Seems like 5 months ago ""just 2 weeks flatten curve"". still wear mask part, dammit seem like goal posts keep moving one...and maybe need moved. agree level - sort plan would real useful. Online courses suck, opinion. won‚Äôt going back school resume classes usual, won‚Äôt waste time money. link points out, pointed you, keep relying completely ignoring:

""These lists inclusive.¬†""

Your link also points flu cause sinusitis. Yes sinusitis inflammation caused flu infection, lead loss smell taste. commonly cold, nearly common frequently severe covid, symptom remarkable degree suffice extremely strong predictor opposed flu.

Not transparently completely ignoring almost this, 
you still actively glaringly avoiding issue spectacular claim re: difficulty breathing. Forgot add introverted. 
Virus never chance. thought Yale free UGA student here. Little meaningful communication coming school. set fail, fail miserably. 

If curious what's said local paper check 

 Fauci needs start job stop giving stupid interviews reading article, mayors fighting mask mandates, governor denied them. Schools recommend them. people ground dealing fall TRYING need leadership top, that's currently pissing telling rain.  completely control. generations, USA going country let fester spread. X numbers steadily declining week,

deaths declining wish Governor Cuomo state's governor. Guy knows shit People going see number think ‚Äùdisappeared‚Äù naturally. see sacrifice hard work gone making number go down. shows evidence long term damage article! It‚Äôs stating symptoms virus. Learn read! cost healthcare system already stressed beyond damage would shutting elective surgeries past months. Hospitals losing millions right financially stressed ever. Masks. Asian countries universally wearing masks day made aware pandemic. US explicitly came them, health experts (including Fauci Surgeon General) said needed preserve them, straight work, helpful preventing virus, even made worse increased risk getting COVID. 

Because that, US took several months adopt mask usage, time virus spread like wildfire. Even experts 180, people didn‚Äôt trust clear lied previously, there‚Äôs still ton mask misinformation circulating today. 

People blame things like inconsistent shutdown procedures, reality shutdowns weren‚Äôt even necessary Asian countries like Japan, never shut still monumentally better outcomes US, people wearing masks beginning. Edmonton, adopted full mask policy. Inside building including schools 4-12, masks mandatory face fine. Hopefully help... scientist gave best recommendation available evidence revised evidence presented? 

And that's problem you? think doubled said ""You know what, fuck it, I'm wrong. I'm never wrong. wear masks, folks!""

I can't imagine dumber quality demand human especially scientist. I'm already done masks honestly. Face it: They're moving goalposts. Stop listening them.

The nightmare ending doesn‚Äôt equal virus going away, doubt that‚Äôll ever happen, science turn tide near future. leader. live liberal town PARENTS pushing get kids back, blaming governor trying stop it. rallies. right vs left blaming. groups sides blaming other. Maybe people try think instead thinking via party line. hear argument one time, might stroke. Good luck getting large portion country get vaccine. 

Some folks science illiterate conspiracy driver they‚Äôre gonna say vaccines turn frogs something. I'm Catholic church requires physical presence healthy adults able to. since March. church holding limited masses week. Nobody issues. pretty much waived religious obligation church never threat anyone's health. Ha, small business tutoring service school kids. 

This less exactly we‚Äôre advocating right now. I‚Äôve got whole mess grandkids want same. Because, like said, they‚Äôre old enough stay home it‚Äôs great option. 

One granddaughters powers virtual work couple hours get interests, whereas used trapped building eight hours day everyone else doing, matter fast slow worked.

Their plan split children certain groups keep designated area building much possible. person within individual group gets Covid, would send specific group quarantine vs shutting entire school. there‚Äôs still common areas groups eventually pass makes containing exposure much difficult.

No, seriously, good. anyone who's mainstream journalist understand material.

It's actually 3 hours 2 hours probably pretty safe.

Wow would guessed 36% loudest, squeakiest mother fuckers alive. thought little evidence transmission touch. Boner pills! answer boner pills along spread faster fast spreads put hundreds people close quarters without masks?

I worry teachers staff. staff decades sixties. Elementary school kids aren‚Äôt going social distance 5-10 year old going wear mask day even they‚Äôre mandated. 

I keep expecting call last minute. I‚Äôm also expecting go back it‚Äôll last three weeks tops schools close again. 

The world sucks sometimes. Actually last year alone well 2,000,0000 people died. Take look one countries well - Australia.

Now back stage 4 lock closing schools again. double figure infections nationally.

If parent US kids home.

This lie. proud it. :) wait 18 days Texas

Essentially pointless getting tested delayed results... False positives happen. 

Very often especially mass testing outdoor testing sites. None tests even went FDA approval process, even know sure sensitivity specificity is. approved Give peer reviewed study suggests herd immunity works

Lol, even herd immunity yet moron, lol.

You yet another science 'tard screaming SCIENCE!! dropping buzzwords without even understanding mean. willing pay double triple pocket knew money would used pay someone's else's dose. live, it‚Äôs starting creep back tourists local knuckleheads. Probably chose reasons related insider trading shown cause infertility males. guys need stop taking speculative single studies prove nothing turning alternative facts online.

We know ton virus, point we're reasonably sure risks. risks longterm complications? Yes. like literally every disease. nasty bug, apocalypse.

Sincerely, concerned MD MURDERERS! _______? Thank do. chemist, feel like decent grasp basic risks study process. China repeatedly said needs quarantine facilities infectious cases severe order prevent household spread.

And based China's experiences Wuhan. know Alaska rapid testing. 10-15 minutes &amp; results ready. I'm interested finding ramifications this. 91 people age 24 died ""COVID""

You're fearing false boogeyman. got test doctors office result hours, it‚Äôs analysis house, wherever got result probably ship lab somewhere look Always been! crazy one wants mention riots. Even want to, history certainly will. got payin people stay home money? Let‚Äôs forget DeVos saying kids virus. know it‚Äôs best kids school multitude good reasons. However, like don‚Äôt send kids school school middle ongoing daily shooting match, don‚Äôt send kids school there‚Äôs cvs test took 13 days 14 days parents.. it‚Äôs almost pointless getting results late  play bull, get horns. ""150k deaths - is, back ratings, highest ever saturday night fox"" - trump august 2020 said massive, mushroom. I've always done anyway. say lockdown ages reopened slowly credit government this. Majority people complying guidelines. Bills sex tied working? Nope, pitchforks holders biggest forks already got Haha funny thing accuse evidence. right, there's point even bother. Big brain time...reduce tests reduce cases.

*taps ventilators* possible seems rare. yes, definitely kids fine, most. Even child mortality rate hospitalization rates small zero. extend small mortality rate kids America still end thousands deaths injuries which... fine personally! Got it! Thank time stay safe :) /s üëçüèª

EDIT: give upvote BTW Sweden less USA.

Broad recommendations far ever went. Never even shut schools. zero antibodies sure sign immunity? read least minimal level must detectable indicate memory. better job it, absolutely. Nobody 'control' though. clinic town gets results 2 hours One day result, 32 hours total. Unfortunately logic compatible cannibal capitalism. wanted reach tv slap NYC provides great baseline many infections need occur given region herd immunity reached. valuable information used determine peak hospital use help cities plan.  Honest question: promising results vaccine? cognitive dissonance pocket sub.

Honest answer: we've seen past, press releases [may may bullshit designed manipulate stock reason people support Trump - maybe virus took hold long realized. actually astounding stupid people gravitate towards like magnet. hold exact views thinking free-thinkers smarter rest us listen science, wear masks kill people, follow Covid guidelines. Nowhere say permanent high risk is.

And everyone knows riskgroup means risk dying... Idiocracy IRL bring sanitary wipes everywhere go. wipe things going touch. moment there... Oooh Boy we're hackles going up.

Edit: reading comments, no, /s required. better without. think necessarily think scathed either. majority businesses still operating like normal Florida regardless covid spike. teacher 9 years. delivery driving private tutoring. 

I lost clients March. school's closed, nobody failing classes, nobody wants hire tutor. 

I one client wants start back September October. Game plan student wear masks face shields continue in-person sessions. impression wearing mask face shield makes pretty much invincible thing. continue take deliveries plenty places one wearing masks, always suit going inside never gotten it. 

(I'm physics calculus tutor, online tutoring kind no-go. need able see student writing interact real time. logistics us set overhead webcam tedious. None clients proper equipment that. Staying home online schooling dangerous?  pitchforks.

But be. really see good idea all. Best comment silly arguing changing leadership solves nothing. reinforced stupid behavior.

We can‚Äôt prevent every death, try mitigate risk. Forcing little snotty nose bastards back classroom isn‚Äôt mitigating shit.

She alone, clearly someone ""telling like is"" downplayed risks covid said masks unnecessary. friend surgeon 80 hours week. think get used it... heard thing. hospitalizations tracked HHS, case count deaths still coming county/state level.

quarantining, wearing masks, precautions could still taken reduce spread coronavirus. fact, *all* deaths could prevented.

if saying legitimate, virus got south korea, would seen similar number deaths population. didn‚Äôt. took precautions. virus got new york, also taken precautions. instead, sat hands allowed hundred fifty thousand americans needlessly die. saying can‚Äôt take precautions? wearing mask equivalent living fear? guys babies. What‚Äôs proposition? fact consequences delayed. Smoking usually causes horrific complications decades road, whereas virus causes immediately relatively little delay. Reports young people dying heart failure months COVID already beginning roll in. become numerous general awareness outcomes increases, think people alter behavior. many would infect occupants home community? would effect numbers overall?

-Issac Asimov Sure, child mortality rate COVID pretty low, comment suggests, zero.

So odds established, figure gamble worth taking. wear mask catch COVID-19, best case scenario recover uncomfortable 2 weeks sick mildly inconvenienced wearing mask. worst case scenario, die.

Every time I‚Äôve heard someone say got Covid everything right, usually say, ‚Äúexcept one time.‚Äù It‚Äôs usually story visiting relatives without mask party mask. Wal-Mart time, several people weren‚Äôt wearing masks unfortunately. happened late June, haven‚Äôt back I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs changed! 

Edit: word I'm SB county. Almost nobody takes masks seriously I'm at.

The redeeming value cheap Sam's Club sanitizer deactivate Covid19 1 minute, sprays wipes take anywhere 4 10 minutes. use soap water, especially groceries produce. 2.5 gallon jug toggle spout tied piece soap to. wash hands go, wash spout turn on. 

Ethanol great too, especially phones small items. make sure spray directly onto phone else risk damaging charging port like mine.

And reason kills people preexisting conditions messes lungs, hearts, kidneys.. problems before, probably after, live.

Not mention, Americans healthiest, fittest country around. people never actually disciplined kids. met ones kids talk back cuss public. want trapped 1800 square feet either. children discipline (not beating them) understand 8 5 house needs quiet, schooling must done, adults working. stupid put staff Covid training...keep distance, wear mask throw rules away lunch, kids group together wear masks. people allowed happen fired. Joking course, seems many hong kongers may really believe it. actually utilize campus career stuff, undergraduate master's program, years *after* graduated school came lifetime guarantee sorts alumni. 

Most recently also double Prometric testing center town, able take certification test PMI-PBA.

You correct everyone takes advantage campus career center, shame, really help go specific problem. know. That's job, wish answer. I'm saying come May clear escalating, schools, government, working plan critical economy. stomping feet demanding schools remain open July (Trump, DeVos) without anything back threatening schools they'd lose funding didn't.

Instead schools scrambling school year starting coming weeks. like hoping best without least plan place worse case scenario.

I two grade school kids too, start couple weeks. district decided full remote learning first couple months take there, although can't open now, sure open November December short case counts dropping almost nothing, unlikely happen. Isn‚Äôt Florida getting lot better though? Obviously messed reopening soon taking masks/distancing seriously last checked daily cases starting trend downwards  single parent households, 2 parent households 2 jobs.  that's probably going go single biggest blunder

I mean... matter wanted do, nearly enough masks mandate, anyway. reason *now*, six months later, we've stepped quality control enough recognize even crappy cotton mask better nothing all. We're *still* short N95s proper PPE hospitals, even today.

CDC's early-March position, one often used Fauci-framers, medical masks short supply reason healthy people need using them, especially hospitals running out. 

If reverse ""blunder"", encourage everyone get mask, run short supply N95s available, even more-underequipped hospital worker corps, deaths patients healthcare workers result. bad news rest country shown committed. whole country gets bad New York peak, leaders act.

The area he's one higher GOP areas city. like first place start really seeing anything red. 

Lots lots rich, white Chads Karens...like couple pointed guns BLM march? around ATL...you're gonna see there. 

My point doubt lot people tested daily system wasnt quite overworked. exactly opposite trump suggests.  going back obvious deceit areas NY similarly well compared NYC without initial massive spread. related immunity people taking action. Rochester Buffalo low new cases deaths precautions taking.

I'm sure people packed bars without masks NYC we'd still problems. Also estimates say [70% herd full shit. think states rampant, people want hear truth. Sadly live world actions consequences. actions led jail. one could predicted COVID. dont think answer let criminals go free avoid punishment. already coronavirus, months pass new roommate gets corona someone else (his results came back positive today), would isolate people haven‚Äôt gotten yet?

Be well! Link? Oxfords vaccine proven safe far covid moderna working technology like eight years, hope helps Reading article, doesn‚Äôt sound like intentional manipulation, rather mix error. Seems caught pretty fast working problem emergency meeting, etc. vast majority K-12 schools real laboratory instruction wherever replaced demo instruction (video, either live recorded).

Technical/vocational college lab courses hand... Part point learn techniques (under professional supervision appropriate setting), teaching online class like math class watch someone else solve problems never actually solve own. might absorb concepts, get practical experience it. We're last.. meaning we're first! Seattle get tested get results next day. know taking long places. kid coronavirus second day school parents sent school symptoms first day. We‚Äôre last! means we‚Äôre first! disagree that, quicker easier stop someone diabetes catching disease suddenly change diet lifestyle required period time. hope helps first go around fall (I believe? maybe early next year) probably go people believe science like high risk people healthcare workers teachers etc wish health department could issue citations mask non-compliance. I‚Äôm looking false hope, week train feel like mistakes could made, 250 people day lot potential mistakes, free, people use it, quick dog course people use it. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs bad idea, love idea using dogs op linked studies love potential. However implementation seems almost impossible me. Cringe :)))) two friends parents died ‚Äúhyperthermia‚Äù (really high fever), won‚Äôt posthumously test them, though signs point covid. I‚Äôm one guy, imagine many deaths aren‚Äôt reported covid deaths. One Arizona, Florida. 100% this. many people want engage fantasy we'll in-person school. Countries like Israel, handled everything better US, still disastrous school openings.

Instead making best bad situation, many people would rather pretend bad situation. They'll spike months followed non-scientific thinkpieces titles like ""NYC thought beat covid. went wrong?""  Proud New Yorker! account collateral damage country already? Well dear leader keeps saying children virtually immune, said today. refuse learn use reason. 4dflexisport manufacturing Poland, coming guess. AirQueen (which aims USA) ""spacer fabric"" language spec. One day enough time get infected **and become infectious**.  get that? Anyone paying attention pandemic internationally would already know density/urbanity doom population death, hard convince Americans fact automatic disdain dense living. expect Americans persuaded data point, comforting know myth disproved even country. They‚Äôre teachers. [source: I‚Äôm teacher] \^ THis! stuck idea. Anyways, nobody know sure best strategy long pandemic over. True, looking countries comparable ones selecting makes sense. sadly winning vs comparable countries. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt know long immunity lasts. regardless, quoting ‚Äúsome neighborhoods‚Äù 70% people antibodies prove NYC reached herd immunity. city overall ~230k cases, 8 million people. claim overall decrease cases deaths simply due herd immunity supported evidence. This. right here. 100% fact. long someone else‚Äôs child seen ‚Äòa sad story, greater good MUST go person learning get kids house!‚Äô proof infection happen. 

No proof can't, either. evidence Antibodies way immune.

Don't recall claiming otherwise. OP talking antibodies, stayed topic. Stop spreading crappy doomsday info

Not me; maybe stop casting aspersions. Welfare afford children abortion / contraception them: Pick neither  Outdoor transmission practically impossible. reason can't spend time friends outside. yourself.

It's fault, though: subreddit hellhole misinformation panic. You‚Äôre spouting nonsense propaganda. live here, Cuomo responsible thousands elderly deaths, BLM antifa destroy city. believe say recite media talking points? I'm saying can't send everybody home, certain minimum number people need matter quiet is. Many many night shift hospital staffers tell watch netflix night many nights, especially small place, epidemic everyone scared come ER, etc.  info main demographic making majority? mostly elderly folks/folks underlying issues?  hate them, care. direction federal government definitely contributed fucked situation became. I‚Äôm huge fan Cuomo think he‚Äôs done decent job things considering. 

He‚Äôs really cracked businesses following safety guidelines I‚Äôm 100% supportive that. daily briefings also decent, we‚Äôre starved leadership (as country) reasonable adult seems amazing point hah. Well numbers coming white house might doing. get credit. /s. irony me, almost 40 Wisconsin winters, people complaining masks right now, white dudes frozen lakes faces completely covered. Maybe slow spread us.  People still travel car NYC. checkpoints prohibiting entering NYC. Sounds right highly doubt IFR actually double NY Sweden. That‚Äôs highly dependent actually testing done. Sweden done 60 tests per 1000 NYC done 15. Right new taking precautions. I'll bet 3 4 events like this, someone says ""just leave open, can't shut everytime someone tests positive"". Reminder!! along Flatbush Avenue people wearing masks street. Yes, Williamsburg well. Hell, went restaurant manhasset recently saw majority people wearing masks. said times I‚Äôve gone prospect park. undoubtedly people don‚Äôt wear masks. Whether they‚Äôre anti-maskers lockdown fatigue. People wearing masks crowded areas &amp; quieter areas. Didn‚Äôt read manual?! Welcome America, valuable people country sacrificed sake economy.

This country makes fucking sick! blame Rand Paul grandstanding speech (when supposed questioning Fauci) along video widely shared Dan Crenshaw (the dude eye patch). 

I mean, Rand Paul doctor, dad relatively well respected, think people bought shit hook, line, sinker. Every day seems faith people US show empathy others taken away. sad... China reopened schools June. Everything good enough test, good contact tracing, strict quarantine rules. There's much De Blasio hate people failed realize Cuomo publically rejected De Blasio's call city lockdown early March. 

It California announced lock Cuomo 180. Cuomo resulted New York closing one week later have.

Since day, he's lost fucking respect. guess people ate daily shpiels rants Trump. Also since antibodies seem fade quickly, able test six months, twelve months later try figure symptoms Covid-related aren‚Äôt completely reliable ways find person previously infected? saddest thing pandemic shown us seem matter much evidence right front people making decisions reopen, lack love anyone make choose money lives. Unfortunately lot people like seem positions power.

We need stop fighting amongst terrible times start fighting main issue planet decades failed corrupt financial system 99% us suffer under. banking cartels need completely dismantled new universal finance system needs put place controlled board people compiled elected group country. need create one world order controlled people create one controlled 0.01%. damage NYC done could contained. 14 day set time asymptomatic contagions guarantee widespread disease NYC. 

If Trump would've shut borders 2 weeks earlier NYC would've fine. Yes, county starts early break every 6 weeks. summer June July break. Three tests, due nature work immuno-compromised, well surgery pandemic.

**2 days tops every single one.**

I think places longer turnarounds either facing staffing, regulatory and/or product quality issues.

It's fucking disgusting mess. proof infection happen. Antibodies way immune. Stop spreading crappy doomsday info Forgot /s Love governor. Showed initiative whole time really made progress sound like invited party. Sounds like tried get minimum wages something. Either way, even successfully embezzle anything, tried.

I hope kids grows lots good food society proud participate in. smart enough

If only...

I live outside Quebec. Everyones staying home except Quebec seems. Parks commision announced 90% beach visitors Quebec. Like why?

Quebec started mandatory mask wearing last week week before. 
Ontario started June.

We quebecors coming work asking mandatory masks say ""oh guys too? Quebec first province start mandatory masks.""

Like wtf going there? werent refused shut down. 

They're delusional. Oh yes. Think pedophilia they‚Äôve spread about. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly good. /s 1% pretty good ballpark estimate infection fatality rate randomised serological studies taken account. Slightly higher NY Spain, 2.5% Italy (and recent study took cells account *edit* got wrong), bit lower places. We've missed cases direct testing. know IFR significantly lower CFR we've pretty ok ballpark now, 0.5-1.5% developed nations broad age demographic spread (Singapore almost entirely young migrant workers much lower), Italy significant outlier. overwhelmed poorer countries may end much higher much lower IFR rates range, depending numerous variables. course many survivors damaged health, scope may become clear years come.

But idea US reasonably well overall ridiculous. Yeah I'm really confused plan slowing spread, opening school. Like said before, delay site schools, vaccine. Username checks out. Always prowl opportunities victim. guess thinks he's God work. reality, he's infecting people due recklessness would go hell, exists lol, literally letter unknown authorship claim divine revelation. Oh thank god. Never glad 5‚Äô8‚Äù Freedom without responsibility true freedom. higher rates infection also means people get severe symptoms long lasting health complications, lot higher 1%. Also widespread infection gives virus chances mutate bit faster. One lucky mutation could make even deadlier 1%. feeling short school year many districts  Lol, article Feb 26th. Clearly date information. Woulda, shoulda, ...coulda. could misremembering, US thought recommendation BUY mask initially supply chain issue. IE rush buy supplies would leave healthcare workers shortage. made home made mask reason.

Not sure came from, thought masks necessarily protect individual wearing mask contracting COVID, helped prevent spread containing moisture exhale. ever remember Fauci saying work - could wrong. parties serve interests capitalists, workers. blackjack! hookers! fact, forget bubble baseball! already evidence Covid could cause problems [male it‚Äôs early know sure yet. got TDap six years 80 90% effective. new rule get booster every five years instead every ten. tell anyone listen ask doctor that.

Like, that's whole point!?  Even didn‚Äôt, probably spread others school.

Are connecting dots yet? totally get coming from. Test positivity rate lot availability tests. I‚Äôve heard rumors even test positivity rate inflated flaws accounting (if you, personally, take 3 tests time positive, count kind thing) given don‚Äôt fully trust government task (or anything) also skeptical countries numbers. you‚Äôre right, India class systems might even testing groups letting die. Brazil better. Personally, I‚Äôm keeping eye closer home, mine. one seems perfect solution here, fingers crossed don‚Äôt come biggest loser history tells tale. Yes!

That‚Äôs good leadership! I‚Äôm proud city. people smart staying safe now. early months terrifying HELL. one wants go back there.

Seriously, great news. 3 almost 400 tested now. really seem bad you? They‚Äôve going month two now, I‚Äôd say pretty good. got pregnant right lockdown. bites definitely would waited let‚Äôs judge. It‚Äôs unnecessary point. NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- New York City Department Education said lost 74 employees COVID-19.

So awful. one family, friends, coworkers. know thousands DOE employees deaths feel overwhelming I'm even City.  frustrates fucking wore mask quarantined start bad reopen sooner too. called teen teen. argument whole article. Saying said minors several times dispute point all. Agreed. Tuition paying classes. paying libraries, labs, tutoring, etc.

It's like people say teleconference good in-person meeting. sufficient cases? Sure. same? No. I've gone large meetings conferences, side conversations hallways lunch valuable actual presentations meeting. America's neverending addiction consumerism cannot stopped. question is, hell Georgia opening up? don‚Äôt corona handled slightest. support opening fear monger harm come children schools open.  100% full shit.  Part issue virtual learning teachers like even try make work. test requirements district. *trying* get us access tests quickly *suggest* tested ill currently plans get us students tested easily. 8% town positive COVID. Right? follow protocol pandemic? multiple friends I'm sure exactly works doctor orders test ways getting results quickly, grandmother needed knee surgery results 4 hours. people job wait 12 days results. Depends kind scientist terms lab work analysis, think value engaging social media. People really want know going social media provides good opportunity reach people. find arguing always productive (though sometimes necessary, given there‚Äôs lot aggressive confirmation bias much discussion). One troubling aspect pandemic become apparent people thinking binary terms, reality, science spectrum. Masks work 100% don‚Äôt work all. Vaccines completely protective nothing. Either die COVID-19 survive fully restored health. know false dichotomies it‚Äôs complex that. educating people science works, acknowledging uncertainty that‚Äôs baked scientific method, find often makes people willing explore nuances know don‚Äôt. 

\-ALR Tests don‚Äôt ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù. 2 metrics, sensitivity specificity. first indicates likelihood positive result true, second negative result. possible accurately represent single term. means got virus somewhere else, school. already it. gone school virus never defended reopening schools. bashed virtual learning continue doesnt work poor special needs refuse throw aside. virtual learning effective large portion country started hire teachers go houses pod students. would wealthy virtual learning fine. I'll continue bash something work. depend school for. go get MBA top-ranked school, lot work involves cohorts group projects, showing bunch future top-ranked school grads capable. programs last 1-2 years, much built around people already workforce.

If MBA program, I'd want refund. 

And let's honest - there's nothing stopping hiring managers putting asterisks next degrees got awarded middle school shutdown. Maybe first-year four-year degree would fine, asked hire someone graduated last year versus someone graduates next year? pick one final year person. 

Which means school year offering inferior product. Arizona hospitalizations really riding wait. They‚Äôre still tanking. said increasing. That‚Äôs weird. would lie spread misinformation?  That's point? less year learn virus. know transmission positive tests straight forward. case, could range simply poorly conducted test fact one person may phase they're testing positive. many cases people symptomatic testing negative. retesting thing. 

When come contact someone tested positive, quaruntine assuming positive risk spreading virus. half feeling shitty last week. First thing ring doctors (Wednesday afternoon. test organised 13:00 Thursday results 11:00 Friday. cost absolutely nothing, didn‚Äôt even go healthcare. Living Ireland btw. see problem.

I either long dont adult relatives adults come contact Yup I've heard said testing available area showing symptoms. I'm Salt Lake County too. idk wtf going on. think started something. way manage centralized point. Like federation something...  Schools reopening definitely bad idea. prefer proper informative news Wait, School started US? thought 3 months summer break. I'd like add counterpoint #1 lot expenses college disappear overnight everything went remote. Employees still paid, expenses buildings still there, used. savings realized cancelled events small may cover added expenses switching remote ops. school spent ton money getting laptops, software, training, wireless service student faculty lending programs, example. said, school public tuition laughably cheap compared schools talking about. really room tuition cutting, especially expecting decreased funding state increased costs IT. fact tuition among lowest find, stopped students school demanding refunds either. likely, even without giving refunds, lot people laid services students dramatically reduced. students understand tuition cost based lot perceived value online versus in-person courses. access free tutoring, advisement, counseling support, etc. danger already. programs place support students areas ancillary academics much inaccessible them. imagine many schools looking choices right now. 

Anyway, private schools think referring must room cost cutting, much guess make. suspect students complain, still enroll. Whatever disatisfaction they've costs, enough stop enrolling years. they've complaining costs elite schools years, keep enrolling, tuition keeps going up. sad! people getting sick dying, people trying help too! Good thing almost Americans conditions would complicate chances survive covid... discussed colleagues Covid-19 survive air 3+ months.. guys suicidal? paying course credit eventual diploma. That's same. joke? US seriously opening schools? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Imagine, moment, real possible scenario many children:

You 10. hear virus killing people. scared implicitly trust parent's decisions keep safe choice. *know* parents let walk street night rightfully assume put dangerous situation.

You go back school, somewhat hesitant, see friends again. realize wearing masks head home tell mom. says worry.

Two weeks later, catch coronovirus age 10. family tells going fine. Slowly, gets worse. stop able play video games sitting bed energy have. parents keep telling alright. One night, taken hospital can't breathe. 

You look around parents room safety. one is. 



How explain child, sitting hospital bed, ""thought"" safe send back? saw statistics. knew dangerous genuinely thought effect *your* kid.

And say dies? comfort know thought ""overblown media""? Florida Arizona stopped testing. numbers past week show this. positive rate new tests fairly similar duration tests 30-40%. don‚Äôt outside help child care. 

So don‚Äôt things you‚Äôre willing send child potential deadly situation? Seems priority child first, didn‚Äôt chose here.

Because care, couldn‚Äôt ethically send child public school year. won‚Äôt even keep mask Walmart watching him, exactly would work school? mean? best tests, beautiful test. Many people say best tests world! many tests can't handle many test. manuals books even say many tests bad. ""but mah outside wurld"" say method process used sterilization make difference. Testing centers closed due hurricane. Looking cases useless right now. spoken Minerva.org highly remarkable claim... Rain certainly make wet, standing lake makes wet. Hmmm, suggest somebody pays 999999999999 dollar study closely. Perhaps assist highly sought study, need answers! know family dad kids got COVID mom never did. Weird, huh? wonder OP factoring people massive heart attacks, strokes, involved car accidents, even attempted suicides (who wound coughing died) tallied COVID deaths croaked. happy hear this! could lead long term change education well. time, refinement, could revolutionize learning done USA maybe globally.

Good luck efforts! ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre best can‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense me. test virus incubation period? wife discussing this. married already wedding scheduled year (or even next year) would 100% eloped planned day celebration everyone future (safe) date.

Obviously would stunk postpone one big day, we'd still married 2-3 years road could celebrate then. would feel guilty risk spouse's, guests', vendors/workers health celebrate something could later time.

Fortunately situation appreciate everyone postpone/cancel wedding event stop spread. course affects poorer communities more, also includes white/Caucasian communities well. Trying make race/melanin virus pathetic. makes damn sense. father get tested weekly job. Sometimes gets back hour, sometimes takes 7 days plus (which useless way - ""oh way, tested positive week ago, everyone seen past week fucked"") safe wearing mask face shield plane? 
I family emergency fly home. tested negative Monday morning. Flew Tuesday. wore face shield mask, wiped everything sanitized.
I plan testing long wait flying get test? 
I know flown grandma died cancer. Funerals death big thing family. Nah that‚Äôs Canada. ^quackquackquackquackquack imo mix notion giving rats ass fellow humans idiotic itself, connected insist otherwise kinda foolish /shrug  waited 14 mine. Lol Given general attitude towards teachers past decade(s), think teachers people. person, can't spread virus. got rapid test got results 10 minutes. Also Georgia like kid Around hybrid model. 

Aka - worst worlds. Parents need deal kids home 3 days week, kids get exposed 2 days. Education still going suffer hardcore 2 days work isnt enough. kids days fucked routine. 

So fuckin stupid. keep kids home. keep kids teachers/staff alive. hard? I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs rather pessimistic honest. Schools Sweden never closed problems keeping things running. definitely increase students personnel home sick, couple weeks. school definitely open without many getting sick, living proof (I‚Äôm teacher myself). Though could lead increase overall cases, might make worth it. 

But said Norway Finland close schools, come said likely came negative positive effects. people Europe three strike policies? something aligns to, like, cricket something? kids' lungs, hearts, brains, whatever else may permanent damage still unknown long-term effects NOVEL virus. don‚Äôt realize sheep. realize kid could've tested week ago? course is, use refer 140k dead, humanity put question

~160k but...   ‚ÄúOh no, could‚Äôve predicted would happen-‚Äú

‚ÄúEveryone! Everyone wanted open schools early, everyone didn‚Äôt want open schools early!‚Äù worked Vietnamese career. really awesome people. really want go someday (I think would let visit now, given reside Covid-Mary capital world). What‚Äôs main way think people getting infected US? addition mask mandate states scares see still 50k+ cases everyday. think it‚Äôs people spreading within families, anti maskers, what? Ok I‚Äôll

Imagine Trump
Didn‚Äôt shut border china BIDENS pelosis democrats even republican objections. would millions dead Biden democrat policy open borders even admit wrong. 621 hospitalizations new daily record, yesterday believe record 586. yeah, yeah. already know test numbers better. anyone thinks good beyond me. question appreciate one most. Thank question asked Dr. Rasmussen AMA. Unfortunately, election year America, means everyone viewing every piece information background thought ""will help politics succeed?"" news one manifestation problem (and big one). compassionate ""your type"" dont consider compromised immune systems. Cough cough. However location services need android devices enable bluetooth stupid. 

Still big brother territory app still lame. called teachers defending reprehensible nonsense give fuck that.  value pristine perfect vision children taught actual lives children.  better anti-maskers. union.

But striking.

That's literally entire power union negotiation.

A union strike useful nipples breastplate. America Dan Patrick, TX Lieutenant Governor. statement combination horror useless. Sacrificing humans virus slow stop it, increases body count. split atom, walked moon, eradicated smallpox, think need magic powers control disease dies people stay tf home?

Corona terrify everyone. Odd thing, know someone involved trial supposed get booster well. They're pretty certain go vaccine fever day. know lot students would still show symptomatic.

God that‚Äôs sad. Rest peace little one. actually isnt true. Many large number open summer NY state. acting like 100% schools opened already closed. Also I've never advocated schools open. I've stated virtual school work widening education gap. Keep mind wealthy parents hiring teachers pod students (somewhere 4-8) throughout country education far better poor. Also throughout spring majority students go daycares school closed like safe home. Health safety first think sanity would survive that. 

I've already human touch 6 months. human talk therapist week. would hardly say sub pro-lockdown perhaps pro-safety sure. debacle, 2 little ones running around house personally 9 3.5, get decide, school?

If find can't, plenty councilor options you. makes totally okay, then. Good know think life expendable.

I think anyone saying life expendable, life threatening conditions, yes much higher risk Covid wrecking you. less silly allowing children, teachers, families die needlessly? old thing. predictable. BC going full, 5-day-a-week, in-class school September 0 mask mandate anywhere province.

We back uptick higher daily case count per captia Ontario now.

Vancouver basically decided pandemic over. Parties, crowds, 50% mask use indoors exceptions, like 20% generally.

I see packed buses roll almost one masks.

I still believe Bonnie Henry, think school strategy staunch refusal mandate masks (and instead trying appeal public voluntarily) confusing best compared reports around world.

I 6yo starting grade 1 sept I‚Äôm seriously considering keeping home, also don‚Äôt want stunt social development.  I‚Äôd happier mainly remote limited in-class sessions, guess we‚Äôll see numbers late August. spreads like thought would actually agree.

We *fifth* highest death rate/per pop US, yet got sloppy summer. Lots cases traced folks traveling state, people certain demographic partying heedless neighbors.

And can‚Äôt nice things üò£ saying 3000 dead per day official numbers NYC April? Yeah, point pandemic, go sick anything, doctor administer covid test (if available.) many 9/11‚Äôs worth people died heart attacks today? ridiculous way push fearmongering narrative. Good, cancel all. time separate sports educational institutions. Hope continues. Since basketball started, takes mind shit going country.  
The bubble seems like it‚Äôs working. Frequent testing private companies, crowds allowed, etc.   
No idea sports didn‚Äôt try something like this.  
 Hope stay away strip clubs. imagine selfish can't wear mask public socially distance people couple years avoid tens thousands unnecessary deaths. pretty fucking sad.  metric shit ton cases. No, testing patchy. four tiers, top tier super stat (very limited testing supplies) high risk - laboring mothers, psych admits, emergency surgery, second tier 8-12 hours, inpatients, etc. Third tier presurgery, normal patients, random people two days.

Far better coverage, breathes even better, almost normally. got professionally made one, double layered surgical fabric stitched in. cup shape around mouth. suctions straight onto face inhale, making take extremely shallow breaths slowly. actually get light-headed first time wore never again. 

I like give people benefit doubt, style common seeing sold around here, perhaps people bad experience attribute masks general, rather specific style. that‚Äôs bullshit agree 100%

How giving structures power going help us? $5 $12 depending many people apply haha I'm sure industry in, industry, hire based flashy degree is. rigorous interview processes place instead. Contrary post here, many people get weeded technical interview process Ivy League grads.

In fact, Google spent lot time money effort determine whether GPA correlated job performance. found not. ALSO found difference Ivy League degree holders self-taught employees degree all. anecdote, feel free look deeply like.

But, anecdotally, happen graduated state school 2.8 make money friends graduates Ivy League schools, except one makes 10k do.

NOBODY statistically insignificant. matter.

People like point fact educated women fewer children. people well average incomes children. Especially rich. Why? obstacles. shrinking middle fewer children. Yes, equality education doea shrink birth rates, see full well high birth rates elite women. education issue, money. Yeah decrease testing definitely big contributor better numbers hut good signs outside well.

What matters getting kids back school importantly parents back work. 1.Turn air flow seat seat around you. 

2. Wear mask sort filter.

Good idea, though impossible implement.

We theoretically *could* hire enough teachers rapid job opening. able build (or even acquire) enough new classroom space 3-6 months, assuming started back March.

It already spread throughout community. Japan technologically advanced 90s economy stopped advancement, continued call advance. I‚Äôm saying stopped completely, still made small innovations rebuilding things, compared parts world, standing still. Got test back less 48 hours. There's nothing unique list. California things also went full lockdown March, required masks, closed indoor dining, still got destroyed much worse Sweden. something missing. concerned possibility vaccine showing antibody-mediated disease enhancement? vaccine type would suggest useful situation?

I'm personally peptide-based vaccines benefits. you? one praising De Blasio. wanna punch bastard face English official language United States I'm AB negative.... guess need continue shelter place bunker? :( New York city 231k confirmed cases 8.4million people, sound like herd immunity think threat evicted good reason  wife got results 10 minutes we‚Äôre FL Many places metro Atlanta offer rapid test gives results one hour. computer ninja get appointment though. Either guy doesn‚Äôt know anything coronavirus thinks thousands school children infected school bringing coronavirus kill parents friends disaster. Surprised pikachu face hope returning normal driving people continue acting normal. 

The hope great miracle vaccine take care reaches family idea continually throws wood fire. 

Maybe people realize they‚Äôre perpetuating misery they‚Äôll grow make change. 

Killing hope swift end COVID priority. anyone interested, brain MRI study 3 months adults, showed microstructural changes 55% study patients. clear long lasts implications are. 78% patients mild Covid symptoms. researchers saying even people get antibodies give wks protection, any. multiple cases people reinfected long time initial positive. Imagine living fantasy world highly doubt many courts would punish parents trying protect children fucking pandemic.  People need stop rolling shit happens fight back. Sweden UK built massive immunity within population. 

Germany not.

The virus spread much faster winter. 

Transmission far easier dry, cold air.

Humans spend times indoors increasing risk transmission give higher inoculating doses.

Mucosal immunity hampered winter.

UV light decreases increasing transmission.

Cold/Flu season reached seasonality cycle almost infections occur time frame. Dual infections far widespread.


Germany zero chance containment without going prolonged lock downs. Much harder much longer ones March-May. expert, imagine UVC would work fine little degradation.
The problem make sure whole mask gets exposed UVC, I'm sure long would take 100% effective since mask porous. wish FI would mandate masks customers. us employees required wear them, basically people lobby. went in-person meeting probably 20 people couple weeks ago. seated around 6‚Äô other, person wore mask. 

Fun fact: I‚Äôm county article took place. 

Also, fuck Kemp. Das cool, concept living living 1/5 life. old vaccine one actually works? Nope, that's entirely false simply means area reached limitation many people tested per day.

Its false, data easily visible. country/state reaches value plateaus starts decline. bye felicia Sadly, ilk never die. really think they're really human. like undead already. People AZ wear bandana bottom lip Yet ANOTHER GEORGIA SHITSHOW national spotlight!!!

Way Gov.Kemp great job always watching buddy Covid-19!!!

Let‚Äôs cancel fall sports already got know total fucking wreck.

Georgia shot Governors guy FUCKING WORST!!!!

COVID-19 loves Governor Kemp!!! Teacher here. reopen Monday. deeply worried everyone involved.  Seems like Florida handling fine, lot cases anarchy like reddit wants be. think people watching see possible properly US post-wave see strategies might helpful. current re-openings Georgia Texas really give good information know it'll shit show. college entirely distance learning least semester. I‚Äôd guess likely next semester rate things going. high schools around opening distance think reassessing every month staggered reopening? would guess lower grades similar. I‚Äôm California mean.... think one first states close first place. 

On flip side, schools Arizona logical smart choice lot decided resume person.

I don‚Äôt get guess nation let kids get shot what‚Äôs dying virus? passing onto parents loved ones? cares! people truly sending kids school completely believe never thought don‚Äôt exist vacuum shit happen cause shit happen others 100% judging many ways. outbreaks would‚Äôve shut asses up. asses getting shut now, takes longer dipshits running around. Bless. I'd guess varies population test results 48-72 hours live. friend got less 4yr sentence embezzlement become death sentence. Also warden making call. may vested interest keeping beds full. originally went judge. alternative? Every time see symptomatic student send entire class home 2 weeks? winter common-cold everywhere? coughing sneezing feverish child class every week winter. 

What working parents then? Especially 2-3 children going school. 

Closing schools doable long term. Opening make cases explode, which, low begin with. think anybody solution "" open matter what, happens happens"". funding comes education military budget, oversee. 

But despite lobbyists reps *do* fear voted out. spending, even irrational spending, comes consent.

Have spoken family members 50?

I can't get single one agree cut military spending. (""But gOttA dEfeNd mUrIca!"") Even liberal ones say that. think Cold War era thing. work surgery scheduler patients two options viral testing. Standard rapid. 

Standard takes 3-10 days depending busy lab is. Rapid takes hours get results next business day usually. Considering develop thousands drugs mistakes, however still produced vaccines saved millions lives around world, strong hand improving treatment HIV made successful Ebola vaccine back January  depending county requiring masks worn students. Alabama. feel pain. like think people wanting skilled teachers right now.  

The main concern parents want send kids school right free daycare. speak personal experience Pennsylvania. Honestly depends it. One hospital said would take almost 5 days get appointment! 2 weeks results. 

Another hospital go test site less 24 hours called. got seen. Tested got results back 36 hours. 

Insane two hospitals, 3 miles apart wound potential 17 day wait time vs 2 days Ah, yea. Something I've noticed Pandemic definition Americans *""living beyond means""* &amp; watching people's lives collapse thought everything would stay perfectly place.

- car payments expensive &amp; relying side-hustles thought would always there, think business traffic would sustained &amp; living house that's big them.

Did think conditions *always going ideal* ever plan actually spend 10 minutes talking person married rather saying *""bye love you""* morning way work?

Rather living life routines tons unresolved issues ever back-up plans? still consistently logged zero deaths dates, going still level Norway.

This article says Norway worried 290 cases two weeks, Sweden closer 1400 say Sweden wave? Let first get nNorway levels compare. still worse (even though twice population).

Also doubt anyone seriously suggests Spain better. Denmark doubt point time done better. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Today Varmland (a Swedish region 270 000 people) reported 14 new cases.

Norway recently opened border Varmland since infection rate low enough Varmland. rising wonder gets closed again. *sighs relief 5‚Äô3* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  I‚Äôm sure supposed surprising not. happens large groups gather. course rural areas access areas do.

I live deeply rural area, small somewhat way.

We small hospital must transport us elsewhere anything requiring band aid.

Luckily fairly near several metro areas great hospitals. Fairly relative.

If start bringing patients areas we're trouble. could work think it‚Äôs tough always choose resign stay home. option. went back, ok too. reason read minds think it‚Äôs really rough them, bet go back rather work start earning money live life want. part People circles groups made think implying unions didnt couldnt exist. part talking wealth disparity real issue would suggest Im trying fix it?

You said refuting insistence connected. provided example disproving form Union. Circles groups connected grouped. called duality. Never uttered word anti ideal dream free market always easy, happens time bosses forced better result. real world often complex that, especially cases easily replaceable workers. 

That programming speak of. truly sorry predicament prevents somehow changing situation dissatisfied. primary reason makes sense. took said pointing different classes function together way isnt balanced, tried twist horrible story Im anti union. hard understand, makes sense.

At point I'm willing believe troll.

Nobody twisting anything several times put words mouth, first koom-bye-ya shit anti-union complaint, projections coming you. never said either. pointed connections go ways. insistence discuss income disparity strawman since original topic ""connections.""

All said done message same.

My opinion connected feel differently. forget eating leafy vegetables. helps much /s rapid result tests get results 20 minutes. live fairly close school son done rapid test 3 times now, easy get appointment impossible either. Supposedly child went first day school, got sick night, tested rapid result test next day... read editorial teachers need suck like health care workers did, jobs.

They ignored compensation factor altogether though. fucking what? I'm sorry government going get away punishing parents protecting children.  Let fucking try.  government overlord every single one elected officials put there.  work US way around.  need reminded that. least 30% people Berlin. even rabid anti-maskers aggressive young guys. Many older middle-aged women, also children. care, mask ""bothers them"". intention I'd hedge bet guarantee school somewhere America put quarantine one day school. I‚Äôd put money it. Thank you! taught great deal put information use. baffling much shit country gets stifled ""but think children!"" can't show nipple TV need protect children. Oh what's that, want send slaughterhouse?

If multiple studies showing rapid improvement ill patients, could huge. perhaps reevaluate distribute wealth church instead crying poverty. truly Picasso loneliness, lemon. get ventilation cell. Would first time led example. shit stayed bad summer long, think forcing kids exposing millions families help slow things down?
Like, really smarter people running show? fucking hope i‚Äôm not. saddest part statement painstakingly obvious look South Korea incredible responses. 

302 total coronavirus deaths population 50 million.

Relative United States 6x population 150,000+ deaths.

It's outrageous heart wrenching.

I make edit acknowledge big number 150,000 citizens is.. post created image mind. Maybe seconds silence, ""cough"". quick Walgreens tests travesty. 

CDC confirmed give false positive false negative rate 15-30%. 

I know many people, mostly young 40, gotten shitty tests use justify vacation/leisure travel. It‚Äôs dangerous chance false result, normalizes interstate travel active pandemic. 

Americans truly spoiled af. really eat home cooked food stay home two months? Wtf Best idea seen yet!!!  listened episode course search see people saying it. comment literally made laugh loud. true. Agree. think need concentrate therapeutics little vaccine. all, vaccines common cold, flu vaccines horrible success rate season. people expire either OTC cold flu medicines. see day go drug store (or doctor must) quick test, prescription XYC medicine. days bed rest unless get really bad, back.

I could wrong virologist, maybe little naive.  get herd immunity need 60-70% infected. death rate 1% would mean 2 million Americans would need die. vaccine today, could probably attain herd immunity limit number deaths 250,000 people. school utilizing paraprofessionals (teachers aides) accomplish this. saying freedom units freedom use whatever unit please? Checks Pretty bad. Feels like ruined life. pretty severe PTSD starting make progress earlier year right everything happened progress made completely gone. social distancing? remember several months ago said would go away, yet still waiting... intentional consequences gutting unions strikes again. Thats disrespectful wonders vaccinations human race. people suffered pox shit man. Iron lungs. disrespectful. ashamed. institutions mix faith politics are...what's phrase?

Serving God Mammon? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wow, okay, like....home doesn‚Äôt mountains!! I‚Äôm tired looking beautiful sandy beach! 

/s obviously thought subhuman elderly die? actually lucky states going remote route else bigger shit show already I‚Äôm sure could‚Äôve paid and/or hotel would free good press. It‚Äôs complicated issue couldn‚Äôt imagine defending sending patients live risk population. I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt care politics much you. I'm confused FL's #'s lol. idea new hospitalizations data point delayed backlog like deaths cases new yesterday? Wish clear one That's 32 Tuesday last week. increase death rate definitely slowing hopefully starts turn back downward soon. problem someone 2 3 years degree. can't *stop* going college. schools sabbatical program take random year still let come back pick left off. re-apply. re-accepted. answer could ""no.""

And loans often kick repayment minute longer full time student. take year start paying back student loans.

So risk making past 2 3 years, $50-$150k expense, completely worthless immediately hook repay without job lined up... job would made payments manageable may never able get can't start going back school feel like 2022.

The system set people drop start again. Yeah, complete disaster. Even actually made one day. thought obvious sarcasm obvious. Apparently based votes reply. Perhaps. studies found issues steam sterilization disposable mask structure. autoclave essentially steaming pressure cooker 121 ¬∞C, whereas lower temperature dry heat 70 ¬∞C found adequate inactivate coronaviruses.

UVC also causes degradation polyester fabrics used N95 masks.

For less critical personal use, I've tossed mask paper bag left oven preheating lowest temperature (\~90 ¬∞C oven) shutting off.  I'd bet less perfect mask still going much better next step mask quality. 

Second, know stock piles limited happened rotating masks? Letting sit week least several days? wetting masks anything breath, actually block *more* particles time pores fill dust particles, like furnace filter. did, schmuck like guys. got kick back protection money Trumps going get prosecuted.

Don't buy lambo. Buy less expensive luxury car make $100K donation Trump Charitable Trust. ??? started one worst places gets watch rest nation burn ignores lessons NYC.

The rest nation ignoring lessons NYC. De Blasio's decision place Covid patients nursing homes cost tens thousands lives. states getting hammered way positive cases 5+ times less deaths. 

The fact he's praised ""how handled pandemic"" laughable. would probably easier tell us ones work. would govt agency propping specific businesses. maybe list look label. quack like duck fuck went Rapid Urgent Care test took 15 minutes, wait around hour it. need call walk clinic beforehand ask ""rapid test"". Itll cost insurance co-pay. dont insurance forget it, $210. starts That‚Äôs funny cause friends China utmost freedom, going clubbing, going eating, going work, traveling friends right WITHOUT need masks. best part is? low chance dying safely. sacrifice? 1 month.

What month now? 5?

So yes never like China while. huge lead compared lot different countries, instead federal leadership, Trump said would magically go away. Complete failure. know ok far, wonder long sustain. working class America supports nation. many work unable work virus, can't possibly keep going. Eventually fall. Feels mericuh man  No. INCREDIBLY obviously work. positive test result shows may antibodies infection virus causes COVID-19. However, chance positive result means antibodies infection virus family viruses (called coronaviruses), one causes common almost America opened soon something. weird. It‚Äôs actually state-by-state basis. That‚Äôs unfair water. vaccinate? People get sick. always have. Median age teacher 40. Gonna leave dying. fine cuomo this, anyone remember states like Rhode Island tried New Yorkers months ago, cuomo protested threatened sue, states relented virus spread dramatically New York everywhere else? remember overwhelming majority social distancing wearing masks. Testing widely available everyone. Never prouder New Yorker. 

I'm sure getting Italy'd helped lot, sad many places wait they're getting massacred take seriously. knew spell understand thus edit.

You spelled nothing. replies make union analogy strawman argument example disproving original notion connected... 

This proves didnt understand word said.

Which part *People circles groups* made think implying unions didnt couldnt exist. part talking wealth disparity real issue would suggest Im trying fix it?

None answer. clearly just... didnt read comment trolling response makes sense like boss? find another job.

In ideal dream free market always easy, happens time bosses forced better result. real world often complex that, especially cases easily replaceable workers. collectively Unionize... together group connection, influence change policy...

They sure do, go ahead point related anything previously said, keep stating like making point, absolutely point act cant understand straight telling perpetrator spreading highly inaccurate notion people fact ""not connected"" Reddit home assume hard understand...

This makes sense. took said pointing different classes function together way isnt balanced, tried twist horrible story Im anti union. hard understand, makes sense.


At point I'm willing believe troll. got/get brain fog one medications totally relate forgetting writing mid-sentence part. seems mostly effected language centers would also forget spell simple 2 syllable words would end look up.

Science-by-headline really gotten hand. 

Let spell out:

There 0.00% chance even 15% US vaccinated Christmas time. 0.00% 15% vaccinated would absolutely best case scenario.

It's sad many governors, mayors, presidents, prime ministers listed idiots promising ""Just hold til vaccine"" startegy. fairy dust rainbow bullshit. said somewhere else watching go like watching someone drop match bale hay, launching bale hay dry corn field leads forest. 

Each step way getting worse people arguing dumb semantics instead dumping water fire (wearing masks social distancing). hate bad government handling this. Im like fucking job good point, gotta say making prediction like pay grade. Don‚Äôt hate player. Hate game. Testing US fucking joke. ‚ÄúBe yourself, unless suck‚Äù president says positive get test, follows can‚Äôt test comes back. Viruses mutate, people got 14 days prior showing signs hospital work rapid tests give results 15 minutes. what's solution? seem lot complaints please tell fix virtual learning. I'd love genuinely learn something point statements virtual learning great regression real. Lmao even people acknowledge different flu overly confident act like ""every other"" coronavirus.

Like bruh coronaviruses act like other, either. demand test vs availability. I'll assume talking New York City rather state whole hardly fair compare wait time densely populated city America suburban city population 70k. im saying businesses didnt abuse money (its fucking pathetic did) dont keep businesses alive people go back work? logic behind helping stay afloat makes sense, failed practice. casualties loss economy motherfucking world. give it. ends, must end instant.  true. county upstate NY currently 3.9% antibody test positive rate. close reaching herd immunity. Yet we've indoor dining bars restaraunts nearly two months, percent positive 1% (7 day avg). 

What caused crazy turn around? community diligent wearing masks months now. Cuomo also strict rules harsh penalties actually follows with, especially bars restaurants. 

So NYC may feeling effects herd immunity. assure areas NY not. We've diligent hell. Spread word. Sure, distance too. probably stand close together next conveyer. lot variables, obviously. initial beef simplification like 'you get infected standing 26 feet away).

Why would FBI care enforcing CA virus regs? Scared virus? I‚Äôd scared live Hong Kong right things playing out.. feel like ""can Zoom interview?

This depends lot types vaccines terms biology, main reason receive multiple types SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need vaccinate many people possible.

Keep spreading truth. Someone symptomatic higher viral load!

No, causal, often coincident. One symptomatic high low load, asymptomatic high low load. there's direct relationship low load low risk transmission, either, earlier link Asymptomatic people likely cross-reactive cells coronavirus exposures prevent viral expansion.

Damned do, damned don't. number COVID-19 cases percent positive tests, two key metrics understanding state‚Äôs outbreak, increasing. Experts, doctors epidemiologists say it‚Äôs time consider return Phase 2 ‚Äúbefore gets worse.

There indisputable rise number COVID-19 cases Massachusetts experts say action needs taken immediately state forced revive restrictions enter another lockdown due second surge.

The Department Public Health reported 438 new confirmed cases COVID-19 Tuesday ‚Äî highest single-day increase two months. 15,316 people tested, 2.8 percent positive coronavirus, 2.2 percent seven-day weighted average, crept low 1.7 percent mid-July.

‚ÄúI think numbers certainly concern us surge coming,‚Äù said Samuel Scarpino, head Northeastern University‚Äôs Emergent Epidemics Lab. ‚ÄúPart reason us take action may still able prevent large surge taking targeted, careful action today. wait percent positivity rate 5 percent ICUs filling up, fewer options may go unfortunate route lockdown.‚Äù

The recent increase cases alarming, experts say, many say began noticing community transmission increasing couple weeks ago.

Dr. David Rosman, president Massachusetts Medical Society radiologist Massachusetts General Hospital, called rise cases ‚Äúvery concerning‚Äù said began expressing worry two weeks ago noticed common daily increases 200 cases, occurred 10 times 14 days.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible see individual daily number, it‚Äôs undoubted look trends trend wrong direction quite time,‚Äù said.

Rosman says it‚Äôs time act things get worse. floated idea returning Phase 2 Massachusetts‚Äô reopening, could mean closing indoor dining, gyms fitness studios, movie theaters, outdoor performance venues, museums, casinos possibly even stopping professional sports.

‚ÄúWhen look trends, positive test rate going ever since around July 11, suggests full three-week trend upward weighted average. can‚Äôt spurious result. real. need respond that,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThe governor said need wearing masks following rules. What‚Äôs clear whether rules Phase 3 lax we‚Äôre Phase 3 people aren‚Äôt following new rules they‚Äôre treating like it‚Äôs new normal. aren‚Äôt new normal.‚Äù

Dr. Ingrid Theresa Katz, associate faculty director Harvard Global Health Institute associate physician Department Medicine Brigham Women‚Äôs Hospital, said believes it‚Äôs time go back Phase 2 ‚Äúshut gets worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel strongly reopening schools number one priority, background rates matter here. community cases continue rise, run risk much higher background rates time schools open month,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt important bear mind growth exponential, small blip means much larger numbers later. want avoid surge, rising positivity rates early warning signs.‚Äù

What open Phase 2 Massachusetts?
Some experts, doctors epidemiologists calling Gov. Charlie Baker consider returning Phase 2 Massachusetts‚Äô reopening plan due increase COVID-19 cases. 

Here‚Äôs reminder open conducted state Phase 2, certain restrictions following public health guidelines:

Outdoor dining
Retail stores
Child care day camps
Preventative health care services procedures, including dental cleanings certain elective procedures
Lodging, including hotels, motels inns
Additional personal services, including nail salons day spas
Recreational outdoor facilities, including campgrounds, playgrounds, public pools youth sports
Professional sports practices
Funeral homes
Warehouses distribution centers
Car dealerships
Driving ranges
Flight schools
Non-construction-related in-home installations

Scarpino said it‚Äôs difficult say whether increase cases due state‚Äôs reopening without information transmission happening. It‚Äôs important state release additional data whether cases connected things like youth sporting events, gyms large parties, said.

‚ÄúI think see things working back Phase 2. we‚Äôre heading wrong direction,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúSomething changed past two three weeks since new things came online.‚Äù

Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday, prior state reporting recent single-day high coronavirus cases, would consider reviving business restrictions cases continue mount.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve slight uptick low 1.7 percent 2 percent, we‚Äôll forced adjust plans data warrants it,‚Äù Baker said. ‚ÄúThat could mean gathering sizes could reduced could make business regulations strict. Reopening staying open obviously big part goal, obviously, can‚Äôt don‚Äôt everybody‚Äôs help continue move forward.‚Äù

The increase cases comes week many school committees across state voting students return fall. Elementary Secondary Education Commissioner Jeffrey C. Riley said Tuesday ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù school districts prefer hybrid model part-time in-person learning, supplemented remote instruction.
But experts warn current work put school reopening decisions could moot point come mid-September current trends COVID-19 continue.

‚ÄúTo safely send kids back school, numbers need low need headed down,‚Äù Rosman said. ‚ÄúFor numbers climbing right likely indication difficult schools open in-person attendance.‚Äù
Scarpino agrees current coronavirus trends Massachusetts don‚Äôt look positive people hoping send children back school buildings.

‚ÄúCertainly, numbers continue direction headed now, won‚Äôt safe way reopen schools,‚Äù said.

In attempt keep COVID-19 transmission levels low possible Massachusetts, travel ban went effect Saturday requires residents visiting states quarantine 14 days produce negative coronavirus test result within 72 hours prior arriving state.

Residents lower-risk states, currently consisting Northeast, exempt. Massachusetts announced Tuesday Rhode Island added state‚Äôs quarantine list Friday due ‚Äúincreases RI‚Äôs positive test rate cases per 100,000.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis difficult,‚Äù Scarpino said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard everybody ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard families children. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs important understand cases coming take thoughtful action bring control still best possible quality life given horrific disease is.‚Äù happy cake day Teachers don‚Äôt places work.

3. Testing people **free** way. 

4. Dogs test **250 people hour**. 

5. Dogs germany **trained week**.

6. Testing done people may **reluctant tested** ways. Think homeless camps people afraid swabs thinking Covid hoax.

7. Results **instant**.

8. Dogs test odor samples **do contact people.** Maybe Philippines take Indonesia' approach test anyone.

That's it? Endangering life someone way $753 bond. think misunderstood OP - suggesting muslim women lower rate transmission due fact wear burkas religious face coverings. Although probably common OP thinks - Islam becoming rapidly less conservative many women choosing remove parts/whole religious covering. However would still interested see correlation burka/nijab wearing lower virus spread - be, mouths covered. can‚Äôt believe people won‚Äôt wear mask hide identity Dumbness anti-intellectual might related they're hardly thing.

You educated anti-intellectual describes smart educated someone disposition towards knowledge experts. Drunk driving good example risk mitigation work, good metaphor virus.

If drunk driver hits somebody kills somebody, typically death occur weeks later. weeks, soon-to-be-dead DUI victim transmit injuries others simply feet away them. mean, education numbers standard living measurements night day North South. Denying science enabling clear present pandemic harm kill people height foolishness. Got close friend boat. shit sucks sure. Stop blurrying photos. people need arrested publicly shamed rest lives.

It's disease spreads air. going spike anywhere people breathe. need Feds tell learned virus, states like new york new jersey moved enact policies would reduce number cases. that's reflected data.

The ultimate hubris whole thing people pretending they've ""controlled"" spread. controlled shit, already burned way population.

It's peaked decreasing Florida, Texas, Arizona, etc speak, despite virtually nothing differently past months. 

If anything, South optimally. Getting everyone infected summer, everyone healthiest, best. Alabama originally.

Don‚Äôt confuse humans leaders. Yeah quarantine permanent temporary forget..... also federal government started seizing mask shipments sent states. work morally bankrupt leadership is. Given way US citizens behaving, enforced lockdown would result full-blown revolts blood shed. I'm gonna hang Northeast hope things go well guess. excess mortality compare last year? means outdoor transmission correct? should. could learn downvotes try find flaw thinking others notice clearly instead restating something ridiculous again. Good them. 

Even mandatory mask order indoor spaces area (just outside Toronto), apparently public transport either count enforced. good 50% passengers wearing one take bus to/from work drives absolutely mad. Especially windows closed AC on. Hey least I'm denying COVID-19's existence like anti mask nut jobs. Sorry lying though, leave.  one said got school. went sick could‚Äôve spread it. That‚Äôs hard grasp really. mean, shouldn‚Äôt be.  control, even lag reporting dropping Democratic governors ! Give 2500 week life. 

They deserve leaders twitter blocked work. copy paste read it? Never trust someone else comes safety. people care slightest. Based many case studies, likely. Probably went couple drinks food turn. That‚Äôs guess. None people deserve benefit doubt. None.  155k dead nearly 6 million infections.  time benefit doubt long since expired months ago.

The situation US right going call drastic measures hope whatsoever getting virus control.  Teachers going risk losing licenses pensions staying home parents going figure childcare situation without sending school infecting everyone infecting parents take virus work.  

As said stop.  excuses.  working.  coexist virus. simply flat possible.  Yes take sacrifice make lives others harder get past better alternative allowing virus run rampant country completely unchecked.  people think economy bad wait large majority country gets infected.  country precipice totally collapsing options. think point people seen folks dropping dead streets, lost relatives - maybe several - themselves. Going terrible illness changes behavior visceral level. school need much. fucking insane. Could offer free tuition forever pay interest.

Greedy slimeballs. US could like Australia - similar border closures China. bipartisan politics view pandemic political tool. Victoria, outbreak worst, different political party federal government, yet instance, sides supporting other!!

By comparison, sick watching play US, mention number blurring cases deaths China likely did. China lot answer US needs stay transparent retain moral high ground. Indeed, that's really emphasize simply theory. one truly knows answers we've time study nightmare virus. Lol. Sports playing around world since May Well, recorded history worries. agree world nuts. Politics aside, seems like decent human being. worry got $10,000,000,000 hard earned tax dollars keep flying. Trash airline. [Garbage study garbage That's funny. People wear masks literally insecurity issues, hence lack mask. Tard. think little blame teenagers. many kids told need go back school weeks. basically something generally love, school, can't fun friends.

If gonna forced go sit room bunch people really soon might say fuck I'm gonna get sick either way. add say thank addition haha. forgotten looking end program. mean isnt brainer. college try charge full tuition online classes Two customers refused wear masks Atlanta. husband wife. got ended spending week hospital. left 150k bill...

Second hand story guy works counter Atlanta. too. depression brain fog. never virus No, it‚Äôs MI. governor done great job way risky. We‚Äôve already lost 5 people family. many sacrificed it‚Äôs ‚Äújust hard‚Äù proactive schools children. reason would never everyone terminally irresponsible. worst yet come reopen now. Princeton known graduate programs, quality undergrads produces. Grade inflation exist Princeton - might bad Stanford, forced curve science classes Chicago, MIT, CalTech.

Edit - also, yes, graduate one schools. Undergrad graduate degree. Never happen, find suitable backup career players make ""prep"" league. works basketball sport played world, football different animal. Maybe varies? got results back 3 days (Wisconsin) Parents anything whatsoever protect children virus 100% avoided actually give fuck kids anyone really.  literally whole reason reopening public schools bad idea. Honestly, believe .I believe virus exists strong flue kill old people ones whit respiratory problems .Every world really dangerous disease like measles meningitis one cares safety measures . read believe random things internet. like many physicians speaking lies Covid. clearly believe random things read internet well. never safe? Asymptomatic people spread virus others. Also people need tests shoring negative employment travel reasons. tried explain someone mental collapse trying understand it.

If people incredibly irrational, need masks random ass stores, would CLOSED. ""if open schools"" nothing, they're literally people fucking listen. need closed. one knows absolutely anything would let reopen right now. people push politically, scientifically.

This list goes on. ""Why need this, we've got this, this."" God see one person ask need masks take eating damn restaurant absolutely need opened. Holy shit.

BECAUSE ACTUALLY THINGS, FORCED BARE MINIMUM LEAST!

That shit hard understand. want hard way, to, full fucking hog kill everyone taking absolutely precautions. rapid test now. everyone get it, exist. 

It takes 24hrs get results. guy thinks de Blasio's personal responsibility get shape also look Israel school reopening go well: 


**""When Covid Subsided, Israel Reopened Schools. Didn‚Äôt Go Well.""**

 

**Israel‚Äôs advice countries?**

‚ÄúThey definitely done,‚Äù said Eli Waxman, professor Weizmann Institute Science chairman team advising Israel‚Äôs National Security Council pandemic. ‚ÄúIt major failure.‚Äù 


  


My main question remains; virus leave permanent damage youths? nice town college kids, poverty pretty bad outside downtown (even downtown go beyond three main streets people stick to), guess representative America. Really nice areas surrounded areas people want go spend money help. It‚Äôs anecdotal, know heard someone say test positive, you‚Äôll hear back quick. test negative, might take longer get paperwork sent since you‚Äôre lower priority. think depends capacity lab week. believe case. might wrong paper /r/covid19 reinfections almost false positives. 

If testing millions people. 0.1% false positive rate that's still hundreds thousands cases makes anecdotal observation data confusing.

There also papers showing full protection asymptomatic people might less antibody response.

The science pretty clear antibodies generated work would nice multiple studies reconfirming this. God pisses much. absolutely power way. asshole middle class money spend, creates demand jobs. Also healthy, don‚Äôt spend hospital bills. winning. saving lives.

Sweden 5k deaths 10mn pop.

GER 9k dead 82 mn pop.

If winning definition letting die 31k people, interested prize. No, you‚Äôve missed part one side saying data suggests kids don‚Äôt spread well, based actual epidemiological data. side think‚Äôs they‚Äôre super-spreaders study Chicago showed kids high viral load. Nevermind actual epi data outweigh studies lab values... really thought, bent curve, over! blame government's messaging. People idiots, community messaging important college athletics programs lose money. know. dad needed test couple weeks ago took whole week. There's point testing takes long. WTF going flu season? business' can't shut week waiting test time someone comes sniffles. 15 imported, 6 local. Looks like we're single digit local cases relief.

Still... CONSTANT VIGILANCE! understand submission political bent, provides much-needed progress update unemployment benefits many Americans relying weather pandemic. Apparently, president make call.  Nailed it. can‚Äôt even spell properly, don‚Äôt try act like know understand single thing economy works. point ‚Äúarguing‚Äù things mentioned, already place working effectively. Weirdo. interesting incubation period. dear leader says, Testing overrated. slow testing get less cases oh look cases dropping we've slowed testing. genius is. needs find way manipulate percent positive that's pivoted to. keep trying hide data, truth always find way boil top. Well aware. Carriers never know got projection 11k week August? Maybe know never going want worst done faster. know running tests experiments long term possibilities. Bottom line money power, always been, always be. Tell families 150,000 Americans, dummy. UCONN plays lacrosse? LOL probably depends located get test done. I'm WV got test back couple days kids hospitalized due covid doing? buddy. end disabled doing? country shuts doing?... Buddy. read whole paragraph numb nuts. Either way financial situation suffers. one instance people get live. Ideally government help people forced decisions. know can't expect shit administration unless already rich. terms harm good, painfully clear. dense. one else trouble understanding. Haha, news story month ago Bay Area guy get tested results back fast enough flew neighboring state, got test, flew back await results. Awesome! know. Let‚Äôs force kids teachers back school! 

Chicken hawks always chicken hawks. Given attitude ignorance lot teachers sub zero interest putting kids public school ever any.  Public schools breeding ground ignorance. complete sentence. is.  actions speak louder words. sure think California ""got destroyed much worse Sweden"". following US news (as much possible) California twice less death per capita Sweden one populous dense (as high urban areas) states US. come bars open churches closed? checkmate Dr Fauci!

/s know pisses libs politics based of. Conservatives dying breed values still stuck 1960 *laughs five feet* ""We less cases rest world""  feel like managers able get done since rather flying states meetings Zoom county know someone kid class. understand correctly quarantining classroom. kid teacher gets sick class, kids teachers switch remote learning two weeks. 

In second grade class changing classes, high school are. So, student test positive kids 6-7 classes go quarantine. 

I think great point think thing...it likely matter time county switches remote learning. least put little effort tell us based trend line Norway actually worse Sweden? today, Sweden around five times worse Norway, would interesting see prediction Norway‚Äôs number greater Sweden‚Äôs. Dude turn around like 24 hours Canada. Nah, SARS-CoV-2 absolutely acts like MERS. /s riots world sin e Covid started. Like said, think question Americans really interested countries. bunch black clad people destroyed vandalized businesses, writing fuck police fuck capitalism city. Sounds familiar? live Mexico.

There protest restrictions Germany week. 

I understand Reddit mostly American get articles America whenever mention problems country comments get downvoted like Americans want ownership idiots. Every country idiots. I'm sure that's case many parents, I'm lots mom parent groups, groups local area, comments kids going going back school basically same, : ""Just OPEN schools already! children need real school stuck home."" ""We can't keep everyone locked forever, take little risk that's OK."" ""just wear masks!"" ""I'm tired virus controlling everythung. Let kids back in, can't afraid something worse flu."" so, started independent ACC crutch lean like Notre Dame does. UCONN pretty insignificant situation honestly. school like USC, Michigan even Oregon cancels season end 2020 College football. ""stubborn states"". I'm PA. dem. Govenor. We've shut since March. opened non-life giving businesses mid-June state-wide mask order.

We're opening schools 2 weeks. them. see..the internet like tube.. husband, friends planned trip Europe year decided cancel trip. friends still went. rather risk go next year. big deal. live 2 hour flight going before. Seriously big deal. What‚Äôs point risking putting others risk? point testing non-ill people? ""just fine"" certainly interesting interpretation numbers. Yeah, mine took 19 days get back... many preventable deaths lockdowns, suicides , overdoses caused them. It‚Äôs also serious lack education. Seriously, could‚Äôve seen coming!? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I'm way. incredibly frustrating, really selfish. Like said, affecting fine - that's deal. fact affect many people makes big deal. many people can't bothered think people God dumb. people hospitalized record rates meaningless? Long term affects.. long term debts.. okay? Trump people getting screwed too, they're stupid know awful care long ""the libs"" ""getting owned"" Thank you. good advice find something able remotely jump it. called old-age job, I'm actually close sixty. lot marketable skills, time left acquire them. lot us oldies took service industry job hold us can't work longer, support two family members one, need keep now. Spoken like someone lift Same. also wore safety goggles look like regular glasses (mostly). send email cover ass, say 'I told so' private

Best advice first boss ever type herd immunity already thought kids get carriers. justification pushing openings?

The fact proven false repeatedly means _everyone_ needs take step back figure worth classes schools all.

Oh pgv may contracted school, sure hell spread themselves. Encourage cliques. Social firewalls best thing risk reduction.   Agreed. I'm also hoping make employers lenient letting employees work home minor cold (assuming job possible remotely). many occasions sick, point work, went office anyway that's expected do. Hopefully continue case, work home avoid getting colleagues sick well. spent months watching virus ravage countries came US saw worked clearly work promptly refused things worked countries?  virus new anymore know lot defend it.  Cramming thousand kids school going end well anyone. Safety always trumps etiquette.... fully expect US science teachers drink death over, holy shit that‚Äôs obtuse policy... *\*looks outside sees rain, taps shoulder notices I'm still dry I'm inside\** 

""I believe raining I'm wet!""  available anyone wants look sound like racist Trump supporting pos encouraging teachers go back school order get paid. 

You also share lack respect insulting efforts gave education. *cries Wisconsin* Line hungers already herd immunity. neighborhoods 70% people antibodies. school district near shut summer school within days 3 positives. naturally districts around opening back fully weeks. 

It‚Äôs almost like logic become anomaly days. There's spike deaths 'bone spurs'. fucking show respect, fool. Spoken like someone lift meaningful weight. WW2 saw 418,000 Americans die. 

Corona 1,000 deaths day US. 

Corona 160,000 deaths US. 

If vaccine free readily available within 258 days, corona killed Americans WW2. 

Assuming death toll stays steady. would they? schools physically closed doesn‚Äôt mean teaching isn‚Äôt happening. Virtual learning work every person involved, including teacher. read article. admit issue data. 5 counties discrepancies made statements issues data county health sites trying fix issues (it lab reporting). governor calling drop win state, fact opposite, still must vigilant. Yes. Parents, also voters, sway opinion school board. want schools switch remote instruction, need school board take action. political. look science, neither safe. contract tracers states allowed question presence riot/protest, statistics even accurate? They're not. I'll staying home advising anyone asks same. unemployed, homeless dead I'm sure we'll look forward returning yuk up, chief. issue many people country selfish self absorbed rearing ugly head again. People keep saying choice potentially cause others get infected choice send kids school despite risk spread covid19 bring home.  Public schools reopening going amplify already massive problem virus flu season starts completely fucked.  People need change attitudes turning back carnage coming. Gods plan mind hour late FUCKING LIFE TALKING IDIOT. fair, still cleaning high contacted areas....... INCLUDE SEATS ARMRESTS EVERYONE TOUCHING 100% TIME! (Read Homer Simpson voice he's trying serious) reasonable. one may get evicted. another may get evicted, get sick, die, family member die, become disabled, cause others get sick die, possibly bring country lockdown again. Etc. yes. seem like logical leap me. way. government help. know tons people fall cracks means testing true places also frequently poor underfunded hospitals absolutely cannot handle massive surge school opening related cases. rude frequently support policies politicians actively made harder get high speed internet sympathy fairly low.  No, hasnt. they're referring Rand Paul got tested contact tracing purposes contact someone tested positive. time took senator get test results back, went gym interacted staffers. test came back positive, stopped that.

Granted, early crisis wasnt exactly standard procedure self-quarantine 2 weeks/until test result showed up. friend Florida got finally got results 23 days later. Turns time took test, recovered already results arrived. Good thing self-quarantined.  politicians are. GOP fucks sake. Enough blaming party. parties fault. PERIOD Tell kid nearly lost life 7 years old pneumonia.

Look, Covid serious virus, one disagreeing that. However, shutting everything looks 1-2 years time wrong. died pneumonia 7, one would bat eye call shutdown schools they're unsafe due pneumonia/flu. 

If going apply standard disease 0.4% death rate, better others area. Flu Pneumonia close. Otherwise, hypocrite spews bullshit. Reported incivility.

Keep personal insults reddit. I'm sure local high school fine though. 85% parents sending kids back school, means school reopening correct decision.

No doesn't. 85% people believed slavery fine (keep mind, Mississippi that's probably far off) would make re-instituting slavery correct decision?

If 85% population believed evolution conspiracy life formed Divine Creation (keep mind, Mississippi that's probably far off), would mean teaching divine creation fine? responsible reopening schools prosecuted. People going die. get vaccine prevent too? Super easy running aerosol / atmospheric contaminants lab.

Not much individuals. experience first thing that's failed N95s (from 5 years ago, take HCWs) elastic+fabric straps. Learned lesson hang rear view mirror. Otherwise, still one less pleasant smell still makes good face seal 6 months, 2 I'm saving things get worse... hope go away. hope two terms President Pence appoints Supreme Court.

Even weren‚Äôt coming worst states infections, they‚Äôd germ tube many people?? Nope. ended fewer 30 guests total STILL. 

We watched ceremony Zoom sure enough, masks worn. officiant, cousin, sisters roped bridesmaids didn‚Äôt want there, etc.

The wedding 7/26 I‚Äôm WAITING hear outbreak 90yo grandma it. 60yo aunt pulmonary hypertension. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è additional 35% taxes US territory. Perhaps schools forced open government, figured they'll say tried (and failed), move onto online learning? 2 million dead means there's strong likelihood either someone know dies, know 100 people (most us do), likely multiple people know die

Why us okay that? don't. HBS, Stanford, Wharton pretty adamant that. deaths rising. Hmmm. Probably someone deserves her. mom works doctor's office whole office tested. got results back less 2 days (negative).  Yes obviously. used wrong word. said horrible ‚Äú*coincidence*‚Äù. concede point, whatever good you. think ""if send kid school make rent, pandemic get worse gdp go down, instead stay home get evicted see happens"" reasonable conclusion majority Americans expected reach ID get invoice. ID you, police involved ID station. People pure energy? ""I'm responsible""

Meanwhile, touts fucking ratings interview pandemic. 

There way many people around quite litterally going day though happening. And, complaining whole time 1%, older people, etc. Heartless fucking assholes. Hopefully schools opened yet see decide stay online call luck tbh. Show picture events, plenty people without masks close proximity. Hopefully luck many spreaders crowds continues. that, luck, definitive statistic. OK I‚Äôm calmer I‚Äôll restate point-

The context clues tell it‚Äôs unlikely COVID. tested negative 3 times, missing certain common symptoms, symptoms seem presenting way COVID cases. sore throat seems caused drainage, cough worse morning night it‚Äôs probably caused drainage too, it‚Äôs hacking cough usually productive.

I lived parents month symptoms, neither developed anything. 

Plus, boyfriend might cells due age, test positive antibodies recently. third fourth positive, got plane travel DR, increases odds results true positives. Logically speaking it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll give COVID. could go back differently, would waited longer moving safe possible, didn‚Äôt need know move forward.

My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt think needs distance me, he‚Äôs told point blank thinks transmission extremely unlikely given 3 negative tests positive antibody tests given he‚Äôs fine small chance getting it. I‚Äôm less comfortable scenario. asking refrain contact week safe point. right deaths per capita, California going second infection wave kill many more, Sweden's epidemic effectively month now. that's California lockdown since March Sweden zero lockdown. tested first week June Twin Cities, MN, got negative results 36 hours. God enough people deny science. Clearly. literally fraction percent population? age extremely susceptible sickness killing them? amazing everyone website resorts lame personal attacks insults people fall emotionally manipulative fear mongering. Uh oh, prepare downvotes post. Everyone sub prays nothing short apocalypse type positive post regarding virus immediately downvoted oblivion straight deleted mods. going hard time accepting leave house get lives point, even 2028 later. lot local officials take direction people top Cuomo, DeBlasio. said refuting insistence connected. provided example disproving n form Union.

That doesnt disprove anything said way. even highlighted thinking makes sense. Remember *People circles groups* (which includes unions) anti wealth disparity? No?

This getting programming speak of. truly sorry predicament prevents somehow changing situation dissatisfied. primary reason boss.

Literally strawman here. doesnt even make point I'm willing believe twisting anything several times put words mouth

This going ""no you"" evidence first koom-bye-ya shit anti-union complaint, projections coming you.

Your entire responses unions. told union somehow disproves said, despite fact doesnt way.

You far away making sense conversation entirely worthless.

Edit: Oh look, edited commented again. Cool. Let‚Äôs live bubbles masks never go outside again. bathe Purell safe. Even Fauci admitted virus going nowhere, even vaccine, it‚Äôs time leave overreaction behind us.

This virus nowhere near bad we‚Äôve told likes Fauci media. severe certain people? Yes, take precautions want. sane people don‚Äôt care ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù anymore, going bring things back normal soon, whether Covid cultists like not. thoughts Pfizer vaccine? proceed forward different vaccine phase 2/3 trials?

Norway's rising.

You replying article discussing Norway's cases rising. 

How confused?   Screw adult teachers, bus drivers, janitors cafeteria workers guess? We've screaming MONTHS they've protesting wearing masks.

Germany also put position of

1) Go hard lock indefinite period time

2) Sweden originally.

Summer ending. know states even privatized prisons. seems unethical think online learning going improve unless people actually work improving means actually using teach kids.  pandemic may eventually end them.   Online learning needs way priority. No, dense. funny anymore You‚Äôve got kidding think people aren‚Äôt taking seriously. Whether health reasons, economic turmoil that‚Äôs causing families, everyone is. Even anti maskers ‚Äî reasons way, usually financial plight. 

Meanwhile emotional stories aren‚Äôt helpful shown context. People like perish every year even influenza B, pneumonia. It‚Äôs sad human life lost. don‚Äôt write stories. point one? conditions parents have? Medicare access? take care themselves, not? 

Sorry theatre US moment painful watch. I‚Äôm microbiologist. see comments. ducking clue you‚Äôre talking I‚Äôm done wasting time idiots. go...yet putting money people.  Look sympathy people financial situation given know virus anyone suspects may infected children infected need stay home.  One single infection easily lead thousands more.  Things like unemployment housing situations temporary whereas death perm even people survive lives changed forever virus do.  People going suck take hit financially sake public health.  one numerous ways virus perpetuated right now.  stop. it. none vaccines pan long term? can't shut everything every year. There's going plan shutting full... UBI made much sense giving corporations employers money. American government hard middle men.

100%. UBI would made people likely keep local businesses afloat trickle up, unlike trickle down, actually works corporations gotten fucked way decided fuck people. Please don‚Äôt take golf away me. 

Hopefully learn golfers take precautions. It‚Äôs thing gets outside right now. get cold blooded, heartless asshole becomes president. obviously didn‚Äôt bother read article. mean everything can. control much control it.¬† usually get pie throwing country comparisons, double standards comments Massachusetts Sweden minutes apart hilarious. Rather Cooper! completely honest though parent i‚Äôd kind pissed shelling 50 grand online zoom classes 

i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs asking (a partial refund) unreasonable Local media Europe (at least Belgium, France Spain) are, last, beginning ask question: ""Why deaths?"".

&amp;#x200B;

There's bounce cases way less people send hospitals. among hospital, cases much less severe.

&amp;#x200B;

The media Europe able hide long proportionally many deaths first wave... weeks they've bombarding every single day news ""cases rise / second wave beginning"".

&amp;#x200B;

And people asking : ""where deaths?"" want answer.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard least one doctor saying may possible lethal form mostly burned leaving less dangerous strains roam freely.

&amp;#x200B;

During first wave well established many days average took severely ill people end respirator either dying surviving. We're scenario anymore now.

&amp;#x200B;

There's bump number cases Europe? Show deaths 30 45 days ""tune"" shall need severely change. Good. It‚Äôs pointless security theater anyway. kids get sick. Many heart lung possibly testicular damage known years. say based studies MRIs ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù patients  Can't get lungs pregnant COVID wearing face condom. It‚Äôs funny. manager, tell people ask something doesn‚Äôt make sense No, saying kids disease school spreading children. children test positive days..... dumb.

Many won‚Äôt survive. Tuition dependent school going struggle. Teaching remotely cost class. teachers get paid same, still buildings pay bills, may send faculty home PCs remote learning. 

And honestly MBA student took summer class online notice difference quality. absolutely true. fact large part going ivy league connections made, fraternal/sorority groups participated in, social circles formed. I'm far science are, friend. don‚Äôt see much ebb. flow Florida. district district, state state thing.

I guess it‚Äôs hard concept brigading science deniers though. article fantastic. man always flying somewhere far avoided getting sick. give hoot anyone thinks says, he‚Äôs even pandemic. talked work yesterday. Everyone said - find way get around like drip water save bunch spit cup keep using (ew). So, anything relying self-administering already flawed. can't trust people right thing. Cases going without second lockdown National policy face masks. 

But states re-closed bars extended restrictions planning lift. generalizing whole country? states across south shown happens throw doors open everything. shows much reaction made back March/April, along PPP money such.

Again, common sense would seem indicate Texas/Arizona/Florida examples happens under-react. multiple containers 3oz 3oz enough sanitizer flight. Thats kind you. I've worse, survival wise. I'll make it, less dumbass family members still love much abandon dragging down.

You wanna help? Vote leaders let shit happen even worst us. Make everyone know everyone know vote.

Advocate better education mental health support, that's best people like family, barring free healthcare general.

Good luck. spread covid-19 in~~ South shows risks anti-intellectualism

FTFY fly every week? Thank service too!! 

I agree habits part, feel naked go outside without mask. Haha There's bravery getting deadly disease sake it.  Show evidence mass spreading event outside article spread COVID South, it‚Äôs LA. It‚Äôs clearly framed way. don‚Äôt see issue. wrote essay titled ‚ÄúSome Facts Apples‚Äù would mad didn‚Äôt cover oranges essay? HBO doc Truth great (and terrifying) look got here, life post-truth era  claim spike south south ""fucking stupid"", non-southern states experiencing spikes well. Either areas ""fucking stupid"" none saw lot NY plates 4th July weekend coast GA. came somewhere. Anti intellectualism seems South's strong suit. pay close attention norm. Insane disconnected reality there. Props them, sincerely. I'm Mississippi admit I've waiting months governor's ""we going another China"" come back bite him.

Same TX, Senator governor said old people willing go die grandkids.... retirees ones bagging groceries Karens. What's worse, mischaracterize timescale geography local outbreak profiles make political.  republican, anti-authoritarian, must idiot reddit..  That's narrative here.  Fascinating watch try. main difference West Coast, least taking action institutional level try stop spread virus.

Meanwhile, leaders south ""but ZOMG!!! Muh Greatest Economy!!! Cure Can't B Worse Da Problem!!! Muh Freedum!!!"" would probably shun call ""Obama Lover."" Michigan worst. 

Then New York. 

Then Cali. 

None South parents ask say without shadow doubt kids dont unknown predisposing factor could lead death

This bad outcome either. Imagining student brings covid home. practical concerns there, imagine child carrying life? public schools, ffs. Y'all acting like kids fingerpaint SATs. ""Do research!""

I'm stickin' scientific medical communities one, bud. Lol.

Rasmussen. one read title thought Doctor Who, pondered nice would could show right fix shit show? flaw. curve NY flattened oblivion. number current active cases statistically Ask teachers. tell even best laid plans fail (new build schools safest). School buildings falling apart HVAC (still lead paint NYC schools), windows often don‚Äôt open, doors closed case active shooters, 200 kids one floor share 2 bathroom stalls, kids can‚Äôt reliably keep masks social distance, 600 kids enter 4 entrances... Oh teachers kids primary caregiver 6 hrs sides they‚Äôre puking, need shoe tied, bloody nose, etc. mention parents aren‚Äôt required notify school they‚Äôve exposed corona many send kids anyways. 

Teachers won‚Äôt proper PPE fancy ventilation systems like hospitals. also trained reducing viral spread‚Äîmy mom healthcare like ‚ÄúWe trained this. (teachers) not.‚Äù 

Until CDC, Fauci Gates realistic idea *exactly* schools function, don‚Äôt trust judgment. plans sound good enough they‚Äôre realistic. Cool. There's also ""I want live house arrest perpetuity"" coalition. take road. worked hysteria Covid permitted lock home long wish, us think life worth living go business usual. bottle bleach spray bottle. implying everyone thinks that's insinuating. Help us understand please. Houstons pretty cool I‚Äôm seeing issue here

People outside park good thing vs meeting homes. Beaches open 

The idea relatively young people live apartments sit home year ridiculous helpful 

The press showing camera angles make things look crowded shame people going outside? helpful valid point, New York New jersey 3 airports well bigger, denser cities massive public transit heavy train traffic. precaution. Seeing second wave Australia likely influenced decision make masks compulsory event COVID return. South warned. knew nothing. need easy target take frustration on. easy pick group legitimate grievances, humble sincere conversation. painful watch media outlets try sides issues past years. pander bullshit conspiracy theories anti-science idiocy try maintain reputation. Preterm births rest, breathed gross people lower pollution levels said leading reasons. 2/3 apply heart stroke patients Id say. acting like cats. Sitting inside circle. Look, according Rasmussen, Trump unbelievably high approval rating.

[And I'm one noticing Biden seems similar Clinton people regret vote 2016. study years election would voters vote now, Hillary actually lost support.

I think Biden slam dunk. following hashtag ""Settle Biden"". worried think reasonable person would be. 

Look, I'm worried. I'm high risk health care worker take care widowed, disabled mom. lost son years ago.

I even need election. Impeach ass. Hunter Biden investigation, surely manage hundred thousand preventable deaths. Democrats buying ad space every swing district shouting Republicans doing. Come on. Reddit historically shown accurate representation real world. Assuming would get pharmacy, pharmacy legally obligated label actual name dispensed medication. reading right? getting 1 table 2? percentage. Unless think mortality rate people 65 100.1%. protests saw maskless crowds idiots protesting virus basically taken selective pressure strains since others dying out. 'new' news.....

That's blatantly false. strains still makes 30% cases worldwide. may live major city think ""old news"", several rural communities easily beat back strain outbreaks, get absolutely WRECKED G strain.

You say ""it's dominant now"" like somehow means every new case across country variant. not. almost 5 million cases US. 2 Million strains. sound like ""died out"" me... Let‚Äôs hope ~~alternate facts~~ feelings opinions good science.‚Äù

FTFY loved one, *sure* he/she passed away COVID? I‚Äôve heard *lot* claims right-wing media they‚Äôre misattributing deaths COVID-19 get funding try make President Trump look bad. 

I specially told numerous times ***bold*Do research*** questioned claims. LOL. closely aligned politics regional culture;

The two one though. see blue bubbles advocating ""lol hurr durr let's wear mask"" THANK YOU. People always shit south... less smart, racist, homophobic, religious, etc. failing understand exists places, manifests differently. Like people real say racism exists South living gentrified San Francisco neighborhood. Many us are. minority causing trouble.

Plus let's forget virus airborne. restaurant bar necessitates removal one's mask high risk activity. Frankly, going work stuck poorly ventilated office day. Masks help lot, stop 100%, percentage probably everything right still getting infected.

I think factors significant drivers pandemic. bothered read short article link question answered there. Hi, prove point again?? contrary, long-term medical costs taking care organ-damaged masses going bankrupt SS Medicare time all. sure helping stereotype, reinforcing it. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ would know data. America fucked thus far, saran wrap faces two bendy straws. ... chalk beneficial telling far 6 feet is, meaning RELYING CHALK KEEP ""SAFE"" DISTANCE.  

Again, use logic. can‚Äôt deport they‚Äôre created lack education, lack economic opportunity, lack consequences crime wealthy, lack social mobility. deported every selfish, conspiracy theory redneck you‚Äôd many ten years unless changed entire government. longer politically correct call someone ""retarded"". must refer anti-maskers. Pretty valid take. 

Do feel like policies intended high density places wrongly applied county? 

What state live in? High indoor mask usage area low COVID case count encouraging side. Hello, cordially invited podiatrist understands basic science then. let's smart enough vaccinations occur outdoors someone's cough contaminate room, render vaccination useless end catching virus immunity develops. Please. caption Thank dearly! travel work still(yep weekly flights still/essential worker) habits learned early March NY made prepared EVERYTHING there. care I'm wearing mask bottle hand sani everywhere go thank NY mentality! idea person like giving personal examples getting downvoted. give upvote agree you. I‚Äôll also add Texan traveled U.S, also find south friendly people around. get door held open every time enter/leave building, 3 people different backgrounds help change tire Texas. New York Cali even wife gets door shut face, she‚Äôs bombshell. nice gym apartment complex (it actually damn near real gym well maintained equipment) always covered up. white conservatives, black progressives/liberals. I'm live literally less mile away Emory hospital people Emory university students...

The root cause people trust government chaos right vs left; throw hands say ""fuck it, I'm living life, whatever happens happen can't navigate bullshit live life"".

Trying boil politics much better friend. 

FYI, I'm moderate I'm taking covid seriously. Wearing mask everywhere, hand sanitizer, etc. case anyone wants dismiss I'm saying assumption I'm anti-whateverthefuck. thought Montgomery Mobile ""good"" parts Alabama? much onboard masks, personal responsibility on, *cannot* get behind this.

Mask not, sick, **stay fuck home!**

Those stylists stayed home regardless. said, I'm skeptical considering one got infected.

This isolated incident that's hard believe. great number. NYC area went exponential spread everywhere else. Even Washington state, roughly half cases traced back NYC. states much higher.

From perspective, ground zero viral outbreak nothing brag about. every sense, initial spread treatment infected, NYC handled coronavirus outbreak worse place US. Philippines, work, pay, unemployment assistance, government handouts. People starving death barangays. much choice. almost 100% masked wears face shield. Much much stricter lockdowns much world.  Michigan too. Phrasing Good. Damn, sounds like I'd feel home there. many idiots provoke (I fucking love conflict). would probably get shot, I? obesity spread? less stress

Not us kids! Distance learning trying work sucked. Capitol city resident Tennessee here. confirm. Even confronted death, perception correctitude matters more. neighbors actually shit together - bad apples spoil bunch, - we're stuck 'em. split urban/rural anything. What‚Äôs excuse New York New Jersey then?.. 70% SARS-1 survivors decreased quality life. patients get better, others get worse. Almost 40% chronic conditions 15 years later.  


People really getting confused severe virus human body brain. initial symptoms someone feels illness (like fever) body fighting illness. novel virus, immune system recognize respond - that's good thing.  


The initial physical symptoms someone feels indicative longterm potential damage going inside you. feel getting HIV. get severe virus like SARS malaria, smallpox, meningitis, serious damage body brain -- often gets worse get older. weakened heart may affect today, tomorrow, next year, there's really good chance adversely affect point, turn chronic problem.  


Just like Meningitis, brain swells get infected (ME), that's loss smell, fatigue, gastro problems, fog aches people feel. nothing someone's physical condition, swelling Myelin region brain. flare via future illness, stress, deteriorate chronic/permanaent condition.  


Which ME/CFS. NHS estimates 30% infected lifelong issues. 


This SARS, people walk SARS infection. thing ""mild"" SARS. Look red sox pitcher barely sick week, cleared return play, heart damage --  outside. seeing issue due reason pandemic. wear mask reduce chances infected reduce chances infecting others unfortunate case infected know it. prevention, treatment like ones mention. principle straw man. spent lot time Argentina friends Buenos Aires saying, lockdown quite strict recently eased bit. Like poster said it‚Äôs going 150 days, friends haven‚Äôt left house except groceries since started. weeks ago started allow going exercise certain hours. It‚Äôs much stricter anything we‚Äôve New Jersey state we‚Äôve actually done pretty well getting control. However I‚Äôve seen pictures Palermo past week seems like lots people now, although look wearing masks. I‚Äôm sure cases high. Maybe Argentine provide insight. bit misleading article's author claim Supreme Court ""banned prayer schools"". contrary, student-led prayer absolutely allowed. mandated, school-sponsored teacher-led prayer justifiably banned public schools. Students free pray privately amongst groups, long disrupt class. First Amendment would permit Thought Police-like regulation children. hospitals faking death count? tin foil conspiracy theorist obviously butt hurt narrative isn‚Äôt factual. Seems like want deaths say south dumb. F believe actually re-open borders vaccine (people still go reason, 14 day quarantine). already put tourism industry life support. think making preparational plans caution. MIL trying tell SD little cases. point SD population less 1 million people. one right mind pay attention state smaller major cities. longer development, testing. don‚Äôt work used, cannot develop vaccines, could learn develop new ones. easy read room decorate furnish known Great Cleansing, Karen‚Äôs Antivaxer, Trump supporting Bible bashing morons New York 35k covid dead. 


You saying? I‚Äôm teacher state known fairly well

Read again, I‚Äôm sure missed it.

We gonna fighting uphill battle here... respiratory population density city Florida doesn‚Äôt even come remotely close NYC. You‚Äôre full shit. wound end enlistment got out. generally leave house go college. idea what's going outside seems something tigers 'rolling tide,' whatever means. year makes want drink botulinum toxin Worst year air thang Upstate NY dangerous NYC Mississippi ever be. many teens died car accidents? Way prove title post. Population density. [In last 24 hours ran 12839 government never ran 17000 single day. far, 760746 tests 213535 confirmed cases total.

I‚Äôm even going show death rate right save embarrassment Dude, dont think politics play deciding pandemic ends, bloody stupid. Speaking person indoctrinated childhood deep south Christianity...learned helplessness HUGE thing. taught memorize bunch Bible verses...these stick memory.

Isaiah 64:6 - unclean thing, **and righteousnesses filthy rags**; fade leaf, iniquities, like wind, taken us Basically there's point good things souls dirty matter

Deuteronomy 5:33 - Walk obedience Lord God commanded you, may live prosper prolong days land Blind obedience = good = get rich (which often gets seen rich = good = blindly obedient) 

Ephesians 2:8-9 - grace saved faith. doing; gift God, result works, one may Again, nothing matters God's person matters

This top head tons verses like taught, memorized, recited children barely old enough talk. stay home, learn online Alive. ‚Äòfucking stupid,‚Äô anti-intellectualist. kids can‚Äôt go school school doesn‚Äôt work  Ah old straw man old republican dumb democrat smart strategy. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work time Try living south time. Interact them. Read posts Nextdoor. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's something prohibits critical thinking natives. Learning learn must taught schools.   


As former northerner, unsettling. Fortunately, places like Charlotte Raleigh-Durham bright young minds moving places. Hopefully smart spreads around south. Sooner rather later. **average** age people died coronavirus 80. ""Anti-intellectualism"" stupid cousin Darwinism? ""Schoooooool's...... out...... COVID!! duh nuh nuh duh nuh nuh"" So, arguing representatives citizens role models rest country handle covid-19? Seven extemely low. Way probably died car accidents Yep. forced gun point federal troops. Also people money sent kids school close 100% white. It‚Äôs like one student working group project everybody else plays grabass. 5 months. Great. fucking great. Love finally see light.  IMO risk exposure going get tested means get tested valid reason get tested. me, valid reasons are:

- mandated get tested job institution 

- exposed someone tested positive

I can‚Äôt really think good reason seek test. you‚Äôre feeling sick definitely stay home call doctor follow guidance. Lol shoe fits south rise again!!! Hilarious :)

And even hilarious recall John Baptist Jewish. California horribly well Reminds story preacher kid used tell. 

A guy's neighborhood flooding roof praying god save him.

A man raft passes offers help him, declines continues praying god save him.

A man boat passes offers let onboard, declines continues pray.

A rescue helicopter sees lets rope ladder, shoos away continues pray.

He ended dying got heaven asked god ""Why didnt save me?""

God replied ""I sent raft, boat, helicopter, else do?""



He good man (and still is) major factor took long become agnostic. mega church every time tithe happens always says ""if guest tight money you, pass along"". mega church without SEED pastor. still lot respect him. COVID over. riots proved it. Get it. part special ed teachers/aids/students mandated Governor, so, that‚Äôs districts MA.

Otherwise agree you; safe way fully remote, despite flaws. yeah, district sucks since it‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôs going fully remote. 

But that‚Äôs reality it, I‚Äôm standing safety everyone small capacity try change minds. south opening schools COVID plan place

What source this? live south, four main counties bordering various plans place convert hybrid online learning based active cases county, well mandatory masks students (though imagine heavily enforced). 

I don‚Äôt agree plans, least area incorrect statement. covid still around solid vaccine treatment available, cruising asking get it. sure zomboi? ü§® Duh. Certain politicians eschew medical science experts whatever mislead public.  feel title fancy way saying "" spread COVID-19 south shows risks stupid af"". It‚Äôs like real-life version doublespeak, oh joy explain California There‚Äôs lot going article.

First, views expressed epidemiologists. Epidemiologists, statisticians, biostatisticians, economists, scientists lot overlapping theories, methods, practices, it‚Äôs hard say really ‚Äúthinking like like epidemiologist‚Äù.

Second, use Bayesian formula derive probability disease given positive test different ‚Äúthinking like Bayesian‚Äù, turn different Bayesian inference. informal twitter discussion, Bayesian inference popular among epidemiologists (most Frequentists).

Last point, many elements thinking like epidemiologist thinking like economist thinking like clinician come handy assessing interpreting findings COVID research. midst pandemic, determining optimal risk-benefit engaging particular activity difficult. honestly assess personal attitudes towards risk social responsibilities toward risk others, hopefully reach conclusion works, despite whatever Epi/Econ/whatever approach take. JFC, governor looks like could graduated college. Artificially declining. According 42 COVID-19 deaths ages 0-14 another 202 COVID-19 deaths ages 15-24. May 30 - 664 cases.
Stayed until....
July 10 - 852 cases


Since July 10 roughly 42,000 new cases.


52 dead. (0.12%) point even Geoegia‚Äôs governor didnt know asymptomatic cases could spread virus know 5 months now. Nice username young people die it. HOAX. /s Literally nothing listed provided actual plan threw around vague buzzwords clearly know noting world. Europe alone experienced failures past decade America. Post shit, studies associated it, r/science.

Watch get ripped fucked apart. Nothing pure speculation jumping correlation/causation. thing really bugs West coast bad worse covid spread, yet see articles singling South. that's place idiots. Trump loves poorly educated. perfect relationship ever. Hey hurts... think like is, do. Even allegedly smart people believe him. He's conman, good it. Maybe society shouldn‚Äôt make marriage seem like end relationships. time happiness goes marriage Nah, safe. That's socially distanced board meeting allowing 80 people auditorium. human scum. theory early on, [this released July 3rd disproved that. Even makes 70% cases worldwide. Look second figure study, shows spread across United States. Make mistake it, strain reason New York Northeastern states hit hard early on, South hit hard now.

Even Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand trouble strain enter 3rd wave cases record setting daily numbers. ""I love poorly educated."" LA ""months prepare"" still experiencing spike. apply dumb dumb hick southern cities?  put otherwise, risk utter dumbass idiots South rise again! pandemic deniers seem like mindless dolts me.

Yes, mostly that's is. wealth misinformation there, people incapable critical thinking suffering it. dentist made gargle teeth cleaning yesterday. ""But I'm backup"" -Trump- People ""north"" would rather dehumanize people living ""south"" pseudo intellectual bid maintain worldview enlightened class intelligent aristocrats living holocaust level aroscity *GASP* ""southern"". 

Shut up. Go watch rick morty jerk weiner fucking enlightened. people sub want shut entire economy down, little different seatbelt laws. talking mask requirements I'm you. continuing lockdowns long covid around entirely myopic, ignores grand scheme. saving lives goal, might effective look two causes higher rona. Every educational institution country covering up. can't make tuition money, football money students campus. could give rats ass students get sick get families sick, long jeep paying tuition. .... still waiting pan lmao Man. looking IHME model Argentina. know major source spread is? looks like fairly compliant masks shut quite bit, yes? Thank you. sad look stem cell therapy ethical reasons. Cause cells grow back die. stems cells game changer. contact trace. muh rights! Technically Canadian citizen also birth - never lived there. hope someday move there. Sooner rather later rate! Georgia shitshow too. 23% heart attack, 20% stroke, 10% hyperglycemic crisis.‚Äù


Why would hyperglycemic crisis decline 10% stroke decline 20% heart attack decline 23%?



Is easier ignore milder symptoms heart attack stroke hyperglycemic crisis? many covid deaths *also* heart issues? ü§î  look CDC data show kids much likely die influenza pneumonia Covid age 15 arguing willingly let kids return school flu season danger Covid-19. That's pretty heartless you. Letting kids die keep using schools daycare centres flu seasons everything wrong America today. many kids think worth killing schools open flu season? Well say that. said NYC can't compared anything cuz first. Can't say agree linguistic comment, think likely someone multiple dialects smart, guaranteed one ""non dumb circle"".

Travelers could reach either state plane, weeks, respective numbers stayed relatively low.  America started reopening, different approaches two non-contiguous states visitors Lower 48 put display. Cases disproportionately grew one other, despite intrastate travel plan paper. biggest difference thus far one state strictly enforcing quarantine mandate, not.  recent weeks, Hawaii made headlines fining, arresting, sending quarantine-breakers home. Alaska, contrast, operating honor system. 

Unfortunately, many pandemic related issues date, political. Republicans conservative states value economy people health.

Fourth graders school North Carolina asked quarantine 14 days student tested positive COVID-19.

The school, Thales Academy Wake Forest, said notified Monday student became infected contact infected family member.

The student asymptomatic last school Friday. Teachers exposed also quarantined.

Thales Academy, network private non-sectarian community schools eight locations North Carolina, made news last week Vice President Mike Pence Secretary Education Betsy DeVos visited classroom applauded school reopening.

Pence DeVos visited campus Apex, Wake Forest.

""We're today open America, we've got open America's schools Thales Academy literally forefront,"" Pence said.

Pence also said administration going make sure schools resources open safely.

""We really believe best interest children back classroom,"" vice president added.

Thales welcomed students back July 20. offered parents two options: fully online fully in-person, according ABC Durham affiliate WTVD.

Students temperatures taken completed medical questionnaire dropped off, according WTVD. Staff faculty also reminded students wear masks.

Because school network private, adhere North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's school reopening guidelines.

Cooper announced July schools could reopen in-person remote learning.

He said schools choose reopen operate person 50% capacity buses 33%.

The U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention swayed national guidance reopening schools. Originally, federal agency warned risks come reopening schools issued recommendations. Thursday, two weeks President Donald Trump demanded schools reopen, CDC shifted tone released statements children high risk getting seriously ill, though original guidance still remained website. pretty special rock sale. keeps wild tigers away.

I believe meet kind people mask skeptics, would says things like ""Scientists say mask cannot 100% protect virus, hence wear mask?""

Lastly, would like add, transmission seems limited America regarding mass gathering outdoor. mean outbreak can't start, like [afternoon outdoor soccer match catalyst Italy's virus crisis. unfortunately true. school work released ""back school plans"" quit next day. 
For starters ""the school fully shut unless whole state shuts down."" happen. still faculty their, plus children, plus 25% student body.

I send kids face face school. rather one year delayed (so graduate university 22 instead 21, big deal!) health issues decades. hell even work? win less votes?? Wait till find cancel women's basketball say keeping kids home year, think far apart fundamental views. But, fully recognize privileged situation. wife work keeping kids home adds little works (which completely happy do) affect already healthy income. 

But, certainly exist families completely rely schools provide child support order make enough money scrape by. dual income families option sell second Lexus one family members quit six figure job, single moms dual income families partners make enough money pay rent put food table. society making families choose safety eating evicted. flat failing families providing ancillary support systems help this. easy problem solve definitely cheap. solved it.

I think easy telling every parent stay home. Right, Germ Theory tells us every disease spread exactly way. 

Got evidence pointing people getting Covid touching contaminated surfaces? 

Or assume informed issue paid reporter Atlantic? ""commonly allowed"" /= ""one-off"" I've learned throughout whole ordeal many Americans selfish. I'm thankful care. Right. show us process works going away? Finally, people looking online education possibilities, stop-gap measure. Yeah, let's take chance hope create whole generation kids permanent lung-, heart- brain damage studies suggests.

If use Sweden example used do.

Just wait schools open late August Sweden see Swedens infection numbers back again. let boomers steal youth? stole mine. everything asked student debt average paying job bills city gentrified much Indian foreigners moving here. like yeah fuck police absolutely fuck fake news media. Go live. flu kill problem give fuck whiny older boomers. many age group demographic die get long term issues? Oh right. Zero 2% üòÇ

The jealousy thread prototypically American. Like trying control generation going work. Sorry think future. Byyeeee Short answer: No. haha trump goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Yup. Takes hospital 1.5h saying you‚Äôre saying every contagion identified. I‚Äôm asking someone would even accomplish you‚Äôre asking. Literally, how?

We supposed find one guy isolated weeks beforehand skipped straight home airplane, without entering terminal coming contact anyone else? lying, turns infected thats herd immunity people. word infectivity versus transmission? Could virus already made rounds out.



 Tho say way ruffle feathers. There‚Äôs data saying herd immunity reached NYC. distract treating eat class school independently. shut one class one school. whole district. lol build schools safes

Wouldn't even count that. Schools worst publicly built structures around experience. Poor architecture, poor engineering, poor construction, cheap. Next large city interstate built several new schools last year, bad roof leaks HVAC system functioning half intended capacity, meaning move air around well intended. common over, new renovated schools. don‚Äôt know people come they‚Äôre reason huge problem. ""It is.""... Somebody playing golf right probably. think so. Hell, even Americans forget less votes. know. Many us feel like sheep slaughterhouse. assets, sum money. lives important government. Fatally flawed didn‚Äôt include orange juice demon sperm needed work! Yeah keep waiting government solve problem. Thank explaining extrovert side. would open opening restrictions opening without them. Honestly, heard around restrictions safety guidelines period. think you‚Äôre jumping conclusions here.

A lot places offering free tests happen live near testing facility get test.

It‚Äôs entirely possible couple felt fine decided get tested anyway. surprise test came back positive.

You‚Äôre making sound like *the act tested* makes dangerous way. mentality isn‚Äôt helpful stigmatizes getting tested. Right. needed things. Restaurants dining, child sports, entertainment performances.. needed continue recklessly expose put everyone else trying stay alive risk. go both. experience job seeking hiring end. went Ivy undergrad went good non Ivy graduate school. career fairs night day. Ivy career fair like meat market biggest well known corporations present basically swarming fair. non Ivy career fair really great. many companies ones aggressive trying get you.

On hiring side review resumes see Ivy (or really good school) always give second look. mean call interview hire (they could suck) means look closely.

So ways networking/soft power ‚Äòhard‚Äô name recognition contribute. many ways impacted example Ivy Career center absolutely fantastic. top line everything really busted ass help place way can. non Ivy one kind average.

If kids make Ivy would everything power get even means eating ramen next 15 years. said NYC New York State. Teachers go class teach empty classroom broadcast zoom whatever. 

Probably best way things.  We‚Äôre point window long-term thinking shrunk month two ahead. Anyone lasting schemes shape society favor doesn‚Äôt much hide it. Hell, don‚Äôt even need hide anymore since everything‚Äôs smash-and-grab mode. Texas fucking nuts politically, man. Governor Abbott would sooner fire teachers striking ask parents randoms ""interested"" take teaching admit he's wrong. kids hard. mean people normally do? Expect schools act surrogate babysitter's? almost certainty go away sometime heat death universe Big Crunch scenario. idiots convince idiots asking care people infringement rights. idiots somehow think right whatever fuck want. ""independent thought"" based GOP Russian FB post/memes/blog posts. dumb sheep convinced lion. Good Job Uconn Two weeks make difference needed. something drastic, people affected die. People stupid things, need companies put customers risk accommodate people wanting stupid things. Republicanism need try employing teachers different teachers group crossover. one buying propoganda buddy....

ZERO people said virus hoax. said reporting virus hoax, political tool. 

You understand difference, right? 

You understand media hiding LOT you, right?

Its us, thats problem. letting g nedia spoon feed garage turn around repeat, ignoring actaul scientists medical professionals listening represent either politcal agendas profit agendas.

Umm, yeah less private schools. surprise. top 10 public school district Massachusetts spends. Fall break. daughter's school still around last week September. actually great time go beach etc schools session then. wearing mask... absolutely empathy sympathy fools. brought upon Man, Americans *really* understand Constitution.

The federal government subject *enumerated powers* Constitution, laid Article Section 8, clarified 10^th powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.

The States much broader authority, course limited Constitutions. bingo ;D Gee wonder gave US okay. try. natural opens mouth. Who‚Äôs first? Today Florida tested 30k. peak last month 70k/day.

But hey, infections ""lower"" everyone back work üôÑ  Freedom good, question. even important. give real feeling freedom right that. Biden picked Elizabeth Warren VP, became puppet master withered away, stayed away identity politics kept plan economic patriotism, country *might* improve.

But see happening. already disqualified consideration due skin color. Right gender, though. Endowments often strict restrictions money can't used for; matter much money endowment can't withdraw costs. *The metric system entered chat* No, NY State 32k deaths. IFR 0.25% like studies shown means 12.8m people Covid 2/3 state would put NY herd immunity.

However, 0.25% studies low end, CDC currently uses 0.6% IFR. 5.3m, 30%. would reduce R0 lot, isn‚Äôt herd immunity (unless people also immune/resistant bc exposure corona viruses like common cold studies indicated) i'm getting ready go picnic friends, lol. say that, point honestly believe large number people really think saying something enough makes true, Trump denying COVID effective vaccine Fauci cautioning bad actually making bad/worse. this, admittedly batsh\*t point view, he's mass murderer.

I'm hoping point view fellow Americans pleasantly surprised turn terrible (the ""aim low"" philosophy), sadly fear they'll still manage disappoint me. We're much race bottom, building enough speed punch hole keep going get there. Incredible many people vote nonsense cruelty. Brazil US. That's based study 20% population infected mid April. way 25% now. closer magnitude 70% 5%. ""Maybe."" Whew! *wipes brow* assume school cleaning crew clean common area. don‚Äôt expect teacher clean.

If school cannot figure one out, don‚Äôt person. Chicago made right move. need war warcrimes. can‚Äôt say anytime someone makes shitty decisions Good thing kids are, quote science ""remarkably resilient"" coronavirus, appear asymptomatic. actually think BLM Antifa people threatening Fauci‚Äôs family? Anders Tegnell said it. trust trust foreigner. conspiracists. think fauci billionaire 500M stake coronavirus vaccines secretly knows hydroxy chloroquine safe effective lying hurt trump make money. Lived NYC 13 yrs. contact several friends really bad back March/April. Great news! hope rest country fall line soon adhere protocol. Singing. Hand shaking. Hugs. .....Duh???? moron. Tell west wanna continue partying go holiday,s act like noting happening worldometers wrong reported deaths nyc three days. extremely stupid. 

You‚Äôre right believe probably won‚Äôt become ill die virus.

But, you‚Äôre still fucking garbage excuse person wanting contract virus help spread it.

The fact you‚Äôre living home older people still would prefer contract virus bring home fucking disgusting. 

You must realize people world you, actions take protect around (not yourself).

Educate yourself. last pandemic 1918. 100 years later here‚Äôs pandemic you‚Äôre spouting shit internet saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad‚Äù 1000‚Äôs Americans dying day it‚Äôs even flu season. Yeah, there‚Äôs lot nuance situation, doesn‚Äôt diminish fact lives lost many people would rather come conclusions listen science. 

You anti-vaxxer sucks man. wish happiness ease. Yeah saw too. one best children's hospitals country live worry them, since Covid said hurting $$ furloughed thousands employees. always great ER specialty clinics kids. excellent news. Paranoid? Far it. should, fact, consider calling dumping this. believe that, bunch hydroxychloroquine sell you. No? would executive order do? Trump going send border patrol DHS army enforce it? think states going enforce mandate? White House told Tennessee close bars, know governor said: No. federal government United States incredibly limited law enforcement powers within United States unless directly relates one areas competency properties. Even then, US federal law enforcement body count probably simply enough enforce order. even presumes order legal, not, would likely ignored issued. sure right place post question hope is! soon exposed Covid get tested? came contact positive Monday. Tuesday morning woke throat itchy bothering me. Tuesday afternoon found exposure. Today headache, body feels heavy nothing else. terrible immune system. get sick get really bad. I‚Äôm kind scared/nervous. I‚Äôve reading articles false negatives tested soon etc. üò© fly two weeks see elderly relatives live mass grave formerly known Florida. 

Before buying ticket bought 3m respirator, goggles, painter's coveralls, sealed upon arrival left trunk time flight home. Oh scheduled test enough time know leaving, positive stay home. need see people die, worried they're going die COVID due De Santis, one infect bunch others. I'm also going catch plane idiots give relatives. 

You assuming someone plane it, coughing sneezing spreading around. Prepare worst, taken surprise selfish fuck infects whole plane except you. countries got better us?

In particular thing yes think assume that's means considering constant moving goalposts entire time. get anyone still takes ""experts"" seriously all. think varies school program. say short people live longer, one reasons. genuinely stunned worked use dogs identify positive cases. Seems like wheelhouse..  ""Not worry NYC! We're picking slack!"" - Georgia. Fake news! Everyone knows children immune! lot people saying it, best people. /s would universal healthcare pay tests Yeah... ""We need focus facts fear. said Florida going like New York ‚ÄúUber Italy‚Äù came hospitalizations fatalities. wrong. It‚Äôs time focus facts follow safe, smart step-by-step plan recovery""

DeSantis- May  would seem people go cruise predisposed getting COVID. 3 days long enough incubate... brought whoever infected. Like, honestly, going work? Kids going kids amount telling touch face, wash hands, stay apart, etc going work. many children infected/get sent home sick possibly pass infection family take school closes? 

I understand parents return work ones need work great willingly risk child's health (heaven forbid) life potentially adult came contact said infected child? Children, part, suffer worst infection like adults do, understand adults feel work, sending children environment puts risk bringing virus home possible get household sick justified.

Either missing something mind flexible enough perform mental gymnastics required justify madness. Ah yes. 'Lessons'.

1.7% population NYC dead COVID. No, cases means deaths rate initially drops, also means death rate eventually catch upas new cases start outcomes.

There tons factors role bad death rate be, probably stay 4% initial calculation used example, new 300 infected high risk death rate jump exponentially, they're young, might drop get people post viral syndrome maybe get feel like shit neurological side effects rest life. toss random number there,? Say 30...... minutes.
Lol

In reality, one knows. Even individual sent home x days, bound infect others. kids. really vicious cycle think leadership point answer, go back school/work try keep social distance hold candle light vigil lost loved ones What's record church Coronavirus spread? sides brainwashed. either, ""America full Nazi/White supremacists!!!"" ""MAGA, virus conspiracy!"" 

 pick team go lol. sucks, want piece machine produces. machine, goods services. Im 99% conviced americans lived mid 1800s wild west, moved shit entire live, would einsteins compared way large % current US population, compared majority maga supporters, compared people 1800s seem like einstein year 3000 use metrics people understand more. 150K dead roughly little less 3 times number American's Killed Action Vietnam War. still rolling we'll blow 3x USA KIA soon. 

Or blowing Yankee Stadium 3x. 

Daily deaths like 4 full 747s crashing killing everyone board. DAILY. 3 9/11s every week. I‚Äôm Portland u pay obvious symptoms find places get result 3 hours. Average 1-2 days results. current pandemic. more. Pandemics become part lives. already much world, US lucky enough avoid previous ones.  Compliance US something like 85-90%. break september? Im canadian dont break september march december president Trump said... Ideology? Bahahah mean medical science. hell would teacher wear free face shield? Like maybe mask uncomfortable, least face shield there's excuse. No, never way, government many people enough. old 9/11? Yes, really do. New Zealand: hold sheep milk would likely count unexcused absences, even now. would implemented national level? CA richest state union. country, would fifth largest economy world. 43% eligible voters declined vote all, unfortunately means actually somewhere around 20-25% voting population literally 1 2 years undergrad, zero clue that's OK. 

Why hard accept Ivy degree going start WAY ahead someone shitty state school, also likely successful overall. literally can't find one stat show opposite that.

Go ahead, spend day find that. I'll donate $100 charity choice reputable. That's true. America's scientists clear reasons use masks -- claim scientists like Dr Fauci useless, protect you, also would take supplies away needed them. Many western countries recommend masks. Even recommend them. Asian countries history wearing masks time. Yeah like equating Saudis pro Royal Family... radicals many autopilot given chance would like abolish system. Ron DeathSentence: I‚Äôll pretend didn‚Äôt see that.  People arguing catch school missing point, fucking dolts. Compare us culture like Japan people group mentality act greater good. 400 something deaths per million vs 8 Japan possibly doable, players want it. also suggested opening negotiations, rather sticking point MLB.


The Players ""self policing"" awful job it. Florida Man? sure exhausting right now. It‚Äôs also probably extremely difficult misinformation politics seem clinging virus. personally trying keep science understand. wish people understood nothing concrete recommendations change based additional findings try flexible. trying follow advice understood today, knowing tomorrow might need something different. Obviously probably since I‚Äôm leadership position need informed. It‚Äôs pretty hard stay upbeat keep people motivated way handling damaging mental health gives people impression never end it‚Äôs lives now. I‚Äôve got family Vietnam (like 10 deaths 90m people) NYC (30,000 deaths NY state 18m people). Honestly, NYC might felt like lot, didn‚Äôt shit numbers prove it. Part leader‚Äôs fault late wasn‚Äôt much people could do. Part western democracy don‚Äôt things like forcibly quarantine (not home, quarantine center) everyone positive talked positive person, talked person talked person like VN. 

But anyway, NY one worst jobs world. it‚Äôs country would worst per capita death rate world wide margin. make sure ventilate well right after, ozone fun.

My mom's teacher im helping buy 5 n95s UVC lamp go work clean mask everyday.
Lets hope works. start putting passenger's cant' wear masks luggage pets. Perfect place them. Here's source estimates infection rate NYC Can‚Äôt rising confirmed cases deaths don‚Äôt test! 

Seriously tho... shit messed up. Great news this. teach cause effect schools? Tide Pod challenge 2.0 reach point stupidity spectrum. take effort come naturally?  set dumbasses  shed tear  anyone see obvious 3rd option? Follow damn rules opening national mandate. States control need shut cannot open virus control like outlined months ago nations done. keep virus sense control testing tracing kids go school. may different set school, return sense normalcy. every option leads lead death suffering, least grand scale. Vitamin deficiency completely appropriate topic bring up, especially given people may getting much sunlight nowadays. linked depression.

People generally suck following good health practices, nowadays people like put walls someone incorrectly associated covid, grant much credence proper context. needs acceptable way broach topic, contextually important times covid discuss vitamin deficiency.

The study crap, can't bothered clarify effects vitamin specifically exactly like chap replied attempting do, we're operating based emotions science. orders magnitude less dangerous false association substance like hydrocloroquine disagree severely dangerous harmful inquire further.  Essential workers way important protesters. ways protest. way get essentials people working. way , forgot delcare support BLM total complete oposition nazis there. Please , sure dont want end considered MAGA fascist you? Thanks!

This scariest cultist behavior ever seen. Anyone believes south monopoly idiots clearly particularly self aware. states experienced peaks earlier pandemic death rates higher. we've months lean best treat covid-19 patients death rate going southern states experiencing peak. mean, would anyone ever listen former bartender?

Maybe Ocasio-Cortez graduated Boston University 2011 Bachelor Arts cum laude International Relations minor Economics. real-world experience law politics elected Representative?

Which narrative Fox use? ""former bartender"".

Jenny Mcarthy faults. Showing body money may morally ambiguous many people, invalidate knowledge.

No, lack knowledge invalidates knowledge. Good point. 

A test nature's results Positive vs uncertain. relayed clearly patient. Great quote Sister ED nurse, told similar story That, political districts drawn like living nightmare. Drugs don‚Äôt get FDA approval mere petridish studies though.

You don‚Äôt cite tests, although would interested knowing many could cite well funded them. I‚Äôd also love hear supposed reasoning shortcomings human studies.

I‚Äôve seen many medical professionals assert they‚Äôve notable success used properly, among treatments.  Look population per square mile get back me. Sweden shouldn‚Äôt stereotype waitresses way. people work food service going college. going college working high status job isn‚Äôt anti-intellectual. reasons anti-intellectualism low intelligence somebody might waitress.

It‚Äôs fun snarky, somebody isn‚Äôt going get favorable view intellectuals experience like waitress‚Äôs. Especially goes church Sunday treated respectfully there. really couldn‚Äôt blame thinking intellectuals aren‚Äôt nice wanting spend time them. actually pretty simple: wear masks outbreaks happen. wear masks NY know bad could useful masks were. know now, yet states still enforcing masks outbreaks. else explain willful ignorance? spread northeast managed? Lol ah man y‚Äôall again. bout California? *Emr Florida's self-defense statues include defense another person valid. non-deadly force using much less likely prosecuted. Oh well, took pandemic show it... fun begins. yet. NJ top deaths 4th education. education tends better high population density states, population density helps virus spread. need go even far, short drive coast end town Central Valley, god-forsaken areas like Kern County 'n' shit. evidence claim. name calling, yet call troll supplying evidence demand?

What problem?

Put shut dude. evidence claims? name calling. misrepresenting claims. rise Trumpism. What's 5? say NY? first thought reading thread title ""isn't covid spreading California much south?"" ""P.S - like grope women"" -- Isaac Asimov  think need look covid county. It‚Äôs hitting rural areas many peoples surprise urban areas outside coasts. Yeah, that's said... Spot on. think due season indoors lot, moreso fatigue whole thing people became complacent?

I'm Canada, paying bit attention Aus see might winter. call wanting break four months incessant childcare top working home chores ""victim complex"". pretty natural want break, decades past assuming parents primary daytime caregivers kids add economic, health, existential stressors. kids empathise parents struggling easy solutions here. happened New York?

My son would take it, hard time learning online. He's senior take difficult science courses graduate. Multiple medical experts said drop could attributed recent statewide mask mandate, backlog tests delayed results, both.

I've literally saying exact thing months. reason data suggests kids affected we've kept home harm's way since beginning lockdowns. media pundits like say kids immune, can't get it, spread it... Yet daycares Texas tons cases single school.... Go figure  It‚Äôs both. people always think one factor another, multitude? get worse, Trump loses November, everything ""did great job with"" immediately seen fuck ups Biden think it‚Äôs good thing. group needed thinning decades. *checks New York covid statistics* quite sad, especially pretend care poor people convenient them.

I live Ohio, one best responses state started. Governor DeWine wise enough know know, deferred someone actually understood issue, Dr. Amy Acton. Things going well prepared deal COVID long haul, response, Republican controlled Statehouse lashed out, people throughout state lost shit spouted conspiracy theories, Dr. Acton eventually chased position mixture political pressure legitimate threats life family's life. led us toward light spit face kicked it.

This national problem, honestly know fix it. Wait intellectuals NY NJ guys couldn‚Äôt use +3 months data Wuhan? Wait school starts again.

Is meant ""cancel culture."" Talk perverse. fuck em.. maybe pandemic make grow up. not. dgaf. Union shoulda left moochin ass states secede. many adults 18-59? see interesting, thing i'd heard even sounding like disboards compilation site discord servers haha time virus considered spreading undetected ‚Äî meaning increased reports Covid-like symptoms patients daily reports hospitals. delivered best possible advice given known time virus status NYC. know virus changed rapidly, continues change. think messages health department changed match growing severity. 

Context tweet also important: time lack federal leadership ton misinformation circulating COVID. 

I don‚Äôt think one tweet supports claim promoting kinds unsafe measures bad Mayor. Furthermore, public messages shortly strongly indicate severity extent protective measures need taken. even articles outlining Dr. Barbot pushed swifter action, ignored de Blasio instead listened others: bit harsh pass kind judgement, particularly support incorrect advice beginning. quantify anti-intellectualism? variables change test effects anti-intellectualism? 
 
No. Anti-intellectualism philosophical, scientific. article blaming spread COVID-19 anti-intellectualism, philosophical state, rather acknowledging scientific fact, itself, anti-intellectual. 
 
This got hypocritical, dim-witted shit I‚Äôve ever heard  think above-average grasp situation. would continue disinfect high-touch areas since seems like easy, low-cost measure, although agree responses seems like fomite transmission overemphasized initial response. Actually, remember story. cold weather coming inevitable shitstorm we'll forced face, hopefully eventually gets cancels, even last minute. Sorry deal that. trying reopen, cost? stand solidarity, able replace teachers thus negotiate. one going sign teaching position, will, still enough. I'm hoping school strikes.

Question viral load-

I moved high risk boyfriend Sunday (71, lupus).

I general respiratory symptoms (cough irritated/sore throat) since mid June. 3 nasal swabs done (which less accurate ‚Äúbrain tickle‚Äù tests) came back negative. 1 soon developed symptoms, I‚Äôm concerned one could false negative 2 could inaccurate since done much later (when tests much higher failure rate, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm paranoid, wanted wear masks distance first week. fell through, he‚Äôs exposed (many times). question is, start wearing masks distancing avoid increasing viral load give him, viral load irrelevant, meaning could live together normal?  We'll see Oxford Moderna approved one. There's chance either two good go fall/early winter Canada vaccinating people US. Could see Canadians getting government folks south getting vaccine months us. say need nearly much though. Takes 2 weeks incubate no? varies widely states. know many southern states start school early mid-August. district NY go back September first, they're finished June. kids, families teachers willing die Trump Kemp, really simple data filtered white house, surprised real number literally double. NBA could put bubble they'll pay NBA salary. I'd fine minimum. Play basketball friends disney months? honestly sounds like fun! Seriously like makes laugh dummies scream cry this. Like put damn mask stop bitching. Hmu seizure benzo withdrawal. Yea see you‚Äôre saying, Profs would high-risk categories. flippant flows keeping students separated safe everyone bc it‚Äôs understanding highly probable they‚Äôll carriers. They‚Äôre gonna social distance KA house. 

But feel ya guy‚Äôs idiot. coronavirus control (1) CDC left everybody blind February requiring use contaminated test first month outbreak (2) instead requiring masks February Task Force told public masks didn‚Äôt work (3) state got contact tracing ready end shutdowns even competent tracing effort. left country totally unprepared outbreaks inevitable end shutdowns. pathological liar medical condition. Ive noticed Chicago depends get testing. example, go University Chicago turnaround quick. Ive heard others hitting local Walgreens dont get results 14 days.   probably story elected officials

Republicans (nearly all). hide ball here.  Everyone Uncle Mitch. He‚Äôs cool uncle. testing widespread, fast, easily available, people could get tested without symptoms peace mind

Well christian, Quran clear science, one hour discovering gods secrets increasing knowledge worth 1000 days fighting/efforts god (fighting effort depending translation problem itself, given problematic language roots quran, thats different story, unfortunately nutjobs take fighting word word, not, neither 7 virgins passage many others)

The reason mostly ignored centuries simply people take book selectively form religion think right instead properly reading dominating long. reminds exactly many nutjob christian right wing churches forget core essence Jesus taught us simply take something vile evil old testament (which means historical book, tribal story collection bronze age reading without knowledge context time creation really breed problems) justify doing. (An eye eye instance instead universal forgiveness whoever without sin, shall throw first stone classical example). 

Not helps religous right wing nutjobs simply would state devil, wanted say is, take open approach science see way grow humanity, know time know more. 

Like know pollution climate change ways (btw. something roman catholic holy woman Hildegard Bingen already research time gave us quite picturesque warning effects disturb balance life overly polluting, quite research trying discover secrets god gave us within plants context time.)

This kind surveillance useful community monitoring. care, option sending children back school virtual classes online.  percent parents chose let kids go back.** Unfortunately kids school 22-28 small room, soooo don‚Äôt expect similar results.... ‚Äúhuman capital stock‚Äù real quote took test Saturday results Monday. I'm Austin Texas. remarkably quick. Ah, fine art cherrypicking data, order manipulate. simplest, effective solution fly. travel. 

They reasons travel fly death. Hi! hope i‚Äôm far topic really want know dangerous covid 19 passed deliveries packages. lot stories country say don‚Äôt go probably got virus deliveries. i‚Äôve read studies slim chance. take this? Stay safe thank efforts!  What? Hypoxia common active infections (and doesn‚Äôt always present traditional way you‚Äôre fighting COVID keep eye it), post-recovery brain fog related research presented others here. Seems COVID cause brain matter changes, possibly damage clotting mechanisms (ie mini strokes). truly immortal governors doing

they putting kids communities life danger score political points questions far me. big Thank work. Seems reasonable.

Considering average bus transports students (say 20?) Back fourth every school day. Cost fuel/maintenance, driver pay. (Which pretty much low)
Yeah think reasonable 5 feet 8 inches, safe! 2 days significant portion 7. California's numbers underreported due processing error. Hence see numbers back again. Haha.

In case serious: time sample reaching lab employee test finished. time spend outside lab processing sample. yeah sounds like fun...unless kids can‚Äôt see person ever. Kept sweet money train a-chuggin!! Sure cost 5 10x many bodies per million neighbors, hey that‚Äôs price progress. I'm NY got results 6 hours. give multiple ducks. Even quack two. staying home self quarantining much can. Still work bills haven‚Äôt vanished. I‚Äôve best. I‚Äôm assumption I‚Äôm already infected carrier virus. Unfortunately requires thinking someone else actually complying measures set place. We've recently seen people violate Australia real consequences. 

Millions people right thing infectious is, takes people comply set everything off. one cares it?? shut global economy.... flip side administration lawyers swear make sport see shitty get away it. There‚Äôs nothing wrong beach outdoors general, socially distance. put daughter's fucking husband college buddies charge national testing plan sure.  Short dudes throwing fists rn manlet doomsday prepper paying big dividends year wait long? country, people usually get answers within 1-2 days Fl here. labs extremely backed weeks now. husband got tested early last month took 15 days get results crazy. Came Trump's economic schools even open? dumb people charge this? realize stupid open schools time... Public school systems closed many months time address virtual learning issues came up? Absolutely nothing.  tax dollars work. feel like head line ominously yet softly plays background first scene disaster movie. go school, would absent receive reprimand/be put list. None thought through. Yeah, DONT TOUCH FUCKING FACE!

Seriously can't said yelled enough.

Supposedly break rooms coffee machines hospitals one bigger places contamination spread. Eating drinking touching face. think direct noon-level sunlight certain geographical regions, live far equator would take longer. yes car glass would block UV Took full 14 days get (negative) results back nyc. makes testing absolutely pointless guy, trump's economic Sure relative Finland, Norway, Denmark?

If cut major tourism economies continue mostly shut down, look? 

And cut Spain Italy worst outbreaks, look?

You're comparing apples fruit basket look economic output different economies -- Nordic countries offer best comparisons See. Teens get virus. I‚Äôm scared go back school (even though it‚Äôs hybrid schedule) since would putting family risk. would rather keep family safe learn home yet Republicans would foaming mouth holding impeachment hearings 500 dead Americans. I'm NY. Got tested Friday morning, gave card website results. Card said 5-7 days. Got results morning, that's odd friend waited long. tested recently?

Negative btw! think it‚Äôs deep part combover. He‚Äôs probably starting thin top trying stay ahead it. Atlanta get hot. state‚Äôs kids successfully weaponized. still cities! Nothing see here. /s yeah, what's interruption.. like 48 hours? sick still sick. yes, drop days probably went got tested yesterday today rebound. bigger issue length get results. bet LOT people bothering even sick, takes 2 weeks get results, mean what's point? Working Saskatchewan, Canada feeling pretty shit 95% people run already forgotten plain care. anything frustrating wearing mask benefit others made feel like idiot it? Clearly meteorologist either. 
 
I know going happen case numbers. currently trending down? Yes. Would like see continue trend down? Yes. ashes ashes fall down! time, win lose, settlement whole thing go away. That's real goal, settlement cheaper sides prolonged trial. masks worked. I‚Äôm going trust someone doesn‚Äôt even proper grammar put new spin history. Nice try, though vast majority doctors aren‚Äôt using telemedicine exclusively. People go rheumatologists infusions. 

Not trained prevent viral spread? You‚Äôre saying can‚Äôt manage simple mitigation techniques good hygiene, distancing wearing masks? teachers can‚Äôt implement basic things, you‚Äôre calling skills question - believe teachers make things happen. 

Schools many countries open. Private schools different parts country opening - teachers administrators private schools make happen public schools cannot? 

Serious question - virtual distance learning catch 42% child abuse reports usually captured school? I'm good masks. However, hear distancing needed years, sounds like end live in-person entertainment. means I'm going get dine-in meal restaurant years. sounds like friends family gatherings, perhaps except summer. means I'm flying anywhere.

I think change society sustainable long. Im moving Lisbon next month. hope Portugal keeps steady now, dont seem badly before. teachers do? mean really? Unless PPE like medics do, dont know else.....except quit? year ago, I'd think routine obsessive unnecessary. Now, he's genius. Thanks sharing! studies coming showing long lasting health issues Corona turn true, kids going life full issues. I‚Äôm narrowing things living fantasy. schools going get hand sanitizer Lysol stuff nowhere found stores they‚Äôre rerouted hospitals? neighborhood haven‚Äôt able get good cleaners months. going pay manage get any? teachers?? bright news here. Hospitalizations state wide started going down. stats legit see deaths go weeks.  

We can't look much case #'s new cases lot testing shut down. weeks ago 9400 people hospital today 7600. southwest Saturday flight serving open drinks disney enforce middle seat empty mask wearing. Good year start homeschool... idk anyone actually cares kid would send school year... infected children tested immediately wander coughing everywhere licking god knows what. Wooow. got mine 4 hours got tested UW hospital Seattle. They'll get kickbacks. Since Spain seen huge rise infections since three weeks ago, almost high peak April, seeing many deaths situation back then.
Is rise case larger testing many people weak symptons, guys think death peak come bit later? Theyve stable 40 deaths day last weeks now.

Also, seems theyre adding result antibody tests total infected well, maybe we'd see situation ""ex"" hotspots well, offered tests. traced school? another stupid headline work summer day camp. daily health screens, everyone wears masks, seperate cohorts 10 less, mostly stay outside. single case COVID. good model operate. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Maybe horror movie lumbering rotting corpse ""braaaains"" kind way, Covid seemed affect cognitive rational abilities millions, even directly infected. 

The throngs anti maskers, pushing reopen schools, ones large parties celebrations, ignoring travel restrictions seem suffered form mental disconnect. I'm sure caused virus directly, infected give sort chemical something affects cognitive abilities others. schools open time like fucking dangerous. think based crappy culture US. There's perception anyone uses government 'handouts' lazy greedy people, worth society based around job do.

There lots little signs people really pay mind to, lot common myths perpetrate it.

From 'welfare queen' pops new kid every year extra government check people's first question meet 'What (for employment)?'

I think poor cultural perception (and US's 'every man himself' attitude) base US embrace social safety nets whole - everything universal healthcare minimum wage/UBI pandemic assistance.

Sadly thing would take multiple generations change permanently. waited 15. speaking, many clinical trials take vaccine claimed safe humans?

Normally clinical trials go phases: phase 1, trial small number people make sure vaccine safe. phase 2, trial larger number people looks measures immune function well safety. Phase 3 trials designed determine efficacy--how well vaccine works--and continues look safety large cohort participants. Phase 3 clinical trials last years evaluate durability (protection time) well monitor long-term adverse events.

\-ALR Could link stories?  parents forced go back work government refuses pay people stay home. I‚Äôve school six years. award. Hundreds positive parent student relationships. 

I resigned morning. Man wait 3 weeks get mine yesterday. work already called back sick showing signs week got results. Thankfully negative. Tuberculosis also prevalent region hallways. many kids walking to/from classrooms. often shoulder shoulder people. Well antigen antibody tests possible rapid format.


Either case, there's reason tests would take longer 24 hours process unless backlog. Well ill seeing one month ""largest child death covid ever"" post. But.... can't that.

You gotta go cases. people say ‚Äúthings go away‚Äù yet, he's still light years ahead Kemp DeSantis. Think second.

From highly embarrassed Georgian Drive. Rent car must. teacher friend starts school week school district teachers wear masks, kids optional. windows (for ""safety"" reasons) open all. HEPA filter way help protect kids, things inside classroom? varies area area school school. Everywhere I've lived grade school started early September college started late April. There's also factors like many snow days cause summer vacation cut short. See get tested local hospital (not ED); many offering drive testing appointments on-site labs run tests. Results taking greater 48-72 hours likely money grab sites, honest. taking advantage reimbursement opportunity outsourcing lab interpretation. Right now, probably going go 100% virtual.

Even economy tanks, CEOs responsible finding ways buoy stock price. Donald? ""It is."" charge behaviour, definitely power influence many peoples behaviour. 

A big part mask mandating worked well us Austria, whenever chancellor held press conference would walk masks on, plexiglass separating podiums, would show press far apart distancing would repeat talking points, ""wearing masks save lives"" ""taking responsibility"" ""protecting other"" ""we together"" said often, felt like talking toddlers. I'm fan current government one thing damn well right, press conferences, barely anyone made fuss anymore. pretty uncaring, ""corona flu, masks muzzles sgive co2 sickness, kills old people"" mother ( conservative fan right wing government btw) almost immediately changed tune exactly points chancellor kept repeating. ridiculous is, glad something got reason logic certainly wouldn't.

Maybe consider Trumps behaviour making decision masks clear me, lot people like would. possible people virus longer show antibodies could immune? Totally possible. It‚Äôs uncommon--in fact it‚Äôs normal--to antibody titers decrease low level acute infection passed. Sometimes might undetectable level. However, still memory B cells capable rapidly producing high-titer antibodies upon subsequent exposure pathogen. also memory cells mediate cell-based immunity, killing infected cells. immune system complex antibodies, low undetectable antibody titers don‚Äôt necessarily indicate lack protective immunity.

\-ALR never occurred now, holy shit, equivalent entire population city just... dead. actually puts perspective devastating would be! talking prison reform said too, anything reform prisons. mean, wasmt asymptomatic. showing symptoms, thats got tested False positives happen. Cool. Give peer reviewed study suggests herd immunity works strain I‚Äôll give 50 peer reviewed studies say that‚Äôs extremely presumptive reckless assume cannot catch twice herd immunity works strain. Assuming (what you‚Äôre doing) antithesis ***SCIENCE*** wonder Trump gotten yet, might even immune. maybe fly infect others? can't stop deaths can't stop spread Covid without 100% global lockdown effective vaccine. global lockdown would never work looks like vaccine might way.

I want enable better world. mostly people like pretend kinds things real evidence makes feel good. What's even point test without self-quarantine? Even test negative, means COVID day testing. could much catch done test, getting results. even mentioning test comes positive - good luck remembering people could potentially infected. doctors take symptoms seriously

Why this? I've seen story story like doctors refuse acknowledge people post viral symptoms damage illness. reluctance study, acknowledge treat things? Makes sense... agree. said, absolutely paid stay home. Instead they've wasted taxpayer money paying friends, corporations billionaires spend time bickering relief package I'm betting still adequate. think want use people's economic concerns suffering causing acting force people reopen safe.

I'm sure accurate early Chinese antigen tests were, new US ones 80-90% accurate.

Instead investing antigen test China elected continue boost PCR testing capacity speed. believe moment PCR test results come back within 4 hours best cases. heard Coronavirus came bat checks out. dip number test results reported daily?

Oh, worry, I'm even leaving house. point, happens someone dies due bringing Covid home? adults interact can't function properly usually trauma childhood. mental health issue going cherry top this. Nah, I'm comparing Northeastern response Southeastern response. Northeastern response bit slow (one week, pointed out), say Southeastern response (five months)?

The confusion/ignorance displayed Northeastern govts/citizens March quite bit understandable confusion/ignorance displayed South still day. So, yeah, issue, many Southerners looking relatively dumb right now. Welp alternative slow, expensive, endangers testers, must financial reason obvious fix ramped running everywhere vaccine ready. remember rumor black communities infected, went part brain 5g causing covid. truly feel sorry people believe things. premise ""alternate facts"" based confusing important difference ""fact"" ""truth.""

A fact empirical, measurable referential piece data. information, rawest form respect issue pertains. 60 minutes = 1 hour; 5280 feet = 1 mile. Facts form foundations understanding act references society agreed use describe interpret world. Truth subjective. interpretation fact towards pre-intended goal. 1 mile always 1 mile, 5280 feet. Whether 'long distance' based context situation informing meaning factual distance. Driving car, 1 mile trivial. Walking, pleasant stroll. Carrying couch yourself, absurd. three cases, mile same, MEANS changes. Factually mile mile, truthfully gets longer longer go driving walking carrying furniture.

When people impose feelings intent matters fact, renders discussion impossible. cannot discuss good faith foundational references topic agreed upon. worsened polarizing defensive nature people dealing duress. attempt return basic point, reestablish FACT basis conversation, goal truth shared valued all, taken attack. Rather deal facts issue, becomes 'us vs. them.' tribal polarity leads deliberately act bad faith, maintain debate one, usually unrelated issue hiding behind 'issue hand.' every child fully compliant regulations times, education budgets raised, buildings renovated, tens thousands new teachers hired provided PPE there's reason can't work FWIW come smaller town IL know fair amount younger people conservative families jumped ship years ago. Millennials Gen Z trending favor Conservatives, matter hard Charlie Kirk Ben Shapiro try. family making feel like exaggerating even that's bit misleading. poor areas usually lesting testing sites, they're disproportionately affected closure - they're likely infected. get disproportionately less results them, opposed areas options (which, statistically also areas less exposed).

Also, negative processed right away, lab go steps process positive officially recognized (it's 7 day process). delayed, negative results similar lag. Don‚Äôt go north then. Lotsa trump lovin dummies norcal. statement stupid.  We're probably getting close herd immunity already. There's many people US infect. mandated forced folks abide.

Problem is, federal government almost certainly authority this.

What happened political pressure pushing every *state* implement mask mandate early on, course Dear Leader going road whatever reason. Trump didn‚Äôt want USFL catch on. wanted USFL‚Äôs lawsuit NFL force NFL add USFL teams NFL. Trump thought found scheme get NFL team cheap.

A similar thing happened past NFC add smaller AFC. doubt seen see entirely Twitter's algorithm. spouse almost exact lockstep politics, follow slightly different people, Twitter shows us wildly different things trends recommendations. see lot ads crushing covid response. user experience twitter extraordinarily artificial. Here‚Äôs one complication, heart actually laughed thought currently world renowned uni.
I mean might case Law, I‚Äôm Naval Architecture MSc engineering department damn near shat move.

All severs went first couple days, took month become stable reasonable speed.
They didn‚Äôt know teach course remotely, countless issues lectures, particular software supposed use didn‚Äôt work remote mode, meaning learn another.

Also uni closed Friday exam week following Monday, left without much direction 2 weeks. kindergartener tik tok. solution teach children socialize give phone? freedumb school what? Ordinarily would said helps identify quarantine cases right, 7-14 day incubation period means confidence interval would way high say anything meaningful. quarantine multiple zones entire city kind uncertainty. 

Thankfully viral load shed early people wearing masks time uncertainty could much less, although would still far big.

I wonder would happen virus took month incubate showing symptoms, heavily infectious presymptomatic phase. think pretty much whole would would gotten sick knowing it. Cherokee Paulding county Georgia case, guys. Real life experiment started Monday public schools see opening schools would work rest country. Stay tuned! /s [More 1,400 lost loved-ones COVID-19 plan legal action Government Yeah, pretty obvious real coping they're massive failure political ideology associate with.  Maybe like schools keep kids certain time day snow storm ""counts"" day funding reasons.

They ""tried"" open person qualify funding Republicans threatening cut. Then, inevitable number cases first two weeks, pack go remote again. That‚Äôs loser talk. You‚Äôre loser. We‚Äôre losers. We‚Äôve lost. Storm dud far Florida standards. going complete chaos legit storm hits us year. way 2020 gone far, bet Florida getting direct hit season. Florida resident since 1997. Would love wrong though! hero. worker. Eat it. is- god expected, course. else think would happen? magic, respiratory virus that's readily transmitted. issue leadership, plan. get kids school slaves get back work making us rich. .. beginning wonder American state governments think anything anymore.

Historically would make 4-6 trips year US spend quite bit them.

Not foreseeable future. Can't travel without insurance. Also, looks like disability life insurance may pay there's advisory something bad happens.

Sigh. Ah yes people don‚Äôt rely paycheck, ever. Try harder? smarter. got results next day. wonder still shaking hands saying, ""Peace You"". like drunk driving affect parents poor kids. live society, yes even America, can't decide what's best think it' affect effect others. Try test Utah site again. burdened first went up, since seen significant slow down. Also, change perimeters see multiple testing sites. sites Ogden way Provo based limits put in. Provo hard get beginning try multiple times. Sure, it‚Äôs easily exploit. that‚Äôs pay attention, things step line, say something. 

Also I‚Äôm unsure charge competent enough exploit us way. K9 handler (search rescue, medical) - line things train dogs do. train tell difference human cadaver animal cadaver, even dry bones. They've trained detect lung cancer.

The limiting factor likely finding safe ways train dogs finding suitable dog/handlers already bonded/have commands. certainly believe dog could taught detect COVID-19 week already trained detect indicate odor presented similar matter. takes bit get point. One way increase number available dogs would use retired detection dogs different disciplines. hope put together training programs soon - big limit people starting training lack access scent samples. Hey went school even survive infection manifesting myriad lingering health &amp; neurologic conditions ... something don‚Äôt want get. all. risk it? Kindergarteners learn online. one building straw man.  helps get jobs Fox News later. conscience. school test, ordered came next day. Send back got results next day. 3 day turnaround, bad mother works church, Chief Staff *losing mind* low attendance due COVID. convinced people ‚Äúget habit going church‚Äù (and attendance = tithing = $) goes long, taking measures strong arm people back sanctuary. example, making popular adult Sunday School classes in-person (they fully capable using Zoom), *requiring* attend main service in-person well attend. Teachers go grab coffee remote learning starts hit bar ends.  WOAH WOAH can't precious privileged individuals actually teaching, that's crazy! fuck grocery workers, electricians, plumbers, IT, construction workers, mechanics, every occupation there. get ass back work teachers continue living privileged existence unchanged home. Child death due economic downturn result virtual learning pandemic. 

Is scenario posed? Because, fucking what? 

And kids die fully open schools. fact. matter takes one burying child. Also plenty studies show long term lung damage COVID. 

Its shitty situation, work around safe way, unsafe way say ""fuck it"" thats retarded I'm halfway max likely lifetime, thing want know morons win. Nothing material appeals more, want feel defeated obnoxious stupidity more. much opportunity already lost it, including possibly clinical immortality lifetimes. much like something heard rabbi say. Way Prevent This,‚Äô Says Nation Regularly Happens majority ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired kids, even say don‚Äôt feel well, I‚Äôm still sending them‚Äù That's anecdotal. I'm well regarded online masters program one 9,500 students one best educational experiences I've had.

Here's information: Idk primary education, know lot colleges pushing open person charge full rate tuition able get away since semester ""in person"" even couple weeks ""It is."" argument I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúit‚Äôs time go back school‚Äù.

There many kids risk. Literally could waited fucking 6 months get vaccines everyone restart safely. test covid-19 give standard appointment seeking asylum.

Test results take days. meantime we're putting immigration workers harms way infection using resources immigrant quarantines. worth it. Send back. know infected anyone else? Lol... Eh went direction really good engineering school crappy school still picky would give credit even though courses absolute joke comparison. Thank you

Wow idiot kicked Facebook group? Harsh /s Chinese said way back when, new number recovered patients, never sick positives, nevertheless suffer long term, sometimes life turning-point, consequences covid. number placed these, guess different quantify (at least yet). think sharing articles portraying interviews street peoples‚Äô Covid opinions? read thread, good enough. muh freedums!!! wearing mask, gloves, glasses, bringing hand sanitizer. Although suspect polling place hand here. I'm leaving vote chance. Abbott ID accurate gives results 13 minutes less. Praise Jeebus!!11aa 50k cases per day, entire country gotten 2 years. assume cases least double that, we're already 6 months outbreak, likely 30 40 percent country infected already. 6 months, entire country gotten it.

What means COVID likely slow since many people become infected runs hosts. idiots though, coping mechanism wich even ""normal"" people deal facing horror everyday abuse. closer brutal abuse, stronger denial mechanism. happens person think could cope knowledge, kind overdrive mechanism, want.

So frequent abusive households name people denial : enablers. silent crowd looks away abuse happens them. 5 days MN here. share chain e-mails anymore, post memes Facebook saying, ""I bet share this."" Solely numbers perspective, little less alarming contextualize it. average, American dies every 10.5 seconds. Please go register tested. family five used tested (symptomless) mother oldest daughter family (all us without symptoms). wish Darwinian experience didn‚Äôt impact everyone around Oh know it‚Äôs semantics. saying 1day back already caught click bait-ey. 

The scary thing sending kids school could already it. sure ton kids gonna test positive unfortunately. 

Scary way around. know logic. Teachers absolutely minority compared parents students, way less teachers compared parents students school. Also parents students say teachers come back, choose resign. Teachers dictators, minority course cannot decide parents students decisions, give advice, can't make decisions others, like can't make science believer school reopen, give advice base facts, law yet wanna stupid conspiracy theorist, choice, However science deniers like harming society whole, kids suffer believe science clearly say go back risky all, reason give life goals satisfy idiocy. Well people expect, seriously fucking obvious thing. aren‚Äôt even peak yet sending kids back school. Absolute fucking morons. I'm pretty active Twitter follow Dems, Biden's account, etc. I'm really seeing lot.

Schumer huge bit TikTok recently pretty uneventful.

It's like realize election year Yep! I'm queens everyone see outdoors wearing masks! Children lifelong access education regardless external circumstances.

Give parents choice. don‚Äôt take away person learning completely. asking people able make choices community. Never thought would become controversial America.

So yes regardless risks, people allowed calculate take risks free people. Let person decide. lot community colleges near enough capacity many people trying save money.  guy go one day, one paragraph, one sentence without repeating words? primary reason companies move workers remote work pay less. Instead paying New York City San Francisco Salary, pay employees salaries based living cheaper regions. Facebook, newly signed lease 700,000 square feet midtown Manhattan would suggest planning transitioning away anytime soon. 

There singular formula career success rather many little choices add time. Spending entire career working remotely means missing many smaller opportunities add time, whether minor promotion, avoiding layoffs, new job, drinks coworker gets new job elsewhere, last minute business trip invitation, accidentally called meeting CEO, eating lunch corporate cafeteria someone becomes division head--the value accidental encounters simply happen remote workers. That's value clustering industries, large, dense cities outperform innovation, creative cultural output exponential rate. asked willing sacrifice get kids house, deflected. Again.

&amp;#x200B;

You're honest. Why? Oh itll cheaper. 

For providers remember NY got mad RI forcing quarantine threatened sue. Jackson Mississippi shithole, one glad they're dead. Impacts second, dirty. absolutely right, type mass murder name: democide. Pantheism. Fauci said never seen disease wide range symptoms, characteristically terms severity I‚Äôm favor kids going back school. safe so.

Right vast number children live areas safe time. It‚Äôs nit safe teachers, staff, parents, others household, communities live in. Uhh, I‚Äôm sure schools go 9k got semester isn‚Äôt cheap. would 72k 4 years 4 classes wouldn‚Äôt complete degree plan. go expensive public school state costs 6.5k per semester 5 classes. US. I‚Äôm almost certain you‚Äôre mixing tuition costs cost attendance. Well gross read. would equivalent California reporting 677 deaths 16,529 new cases. Alberta, we‚Äôve seen schools work open places: horribly

But it‚Äôs okay! reopening plan fall

I've heard mandatory universal masking prevent second wave.

Can someone explain why? make sense me...

From understand, covid-19 spread droplets, masks prevent contaminated droplets falling onto surfaces people touch public places ... therefore contaminated surfaces touch ... therefore one get sick?

Combine universal maksing hand washing, viruses spread? Go away like things go away, health, life, prosperity, dignity Good thing went building packed people huh? continue forever Golf cheater chief. I'll take ""Outcomes surprised nobody"", Alex day 5 thing :


‚Äúfeeling day five onwards, time people begin deteriorate significantly. Around 20% people fall category, older people pre-existing health conditions likely require hospitalisation. Watch intense fatigue, difficulty breathing overall deterioration feeling.‚Äù money? Honestly it‚Äôs even deeper that.

You also gone extremely quiet difficulty breathing, still continuing double down. Amazing many teachers less dedication towards jobs grocery store workers. much ""heroes"" youth... Well surprise "" don‚Äôt see children ones paying price.""

You exactly right.

We know long term affects virus. willing gamble kids future want back school? ""strike"" instead threaten resign?  want candy now!!! People say states trump lies data time, China? know man, moved Philly Fenwick Island Delaware right things started getting bad (around mid April) people masked social distancing then. visited 3 weeks ago everyone mask social distanced even outside. Saw lot people chin masking pulled got within 10 feet someone street. mean, answer question posted article?

I'm SHOCKED! put there! get similar experiences Yale particular subject happen go one top schools it. hospitality, major, example, Ivy League schools except Cornell appear anywhere top 20, State schools like UCF UNLV do. Small class sizes covering advanced materials big plus, something personally experienced. I've never class 80 people, introductory course, 30 normal, personal attention norm. degree end sort pull Yale? No. certainly similar experiences. Cool, considering inept online school compared ""real school"" good kid he'll uneducated future. seriously get dumb are, people able endure lockdown several months especially virus likely anything you. We‚Äôre good, people living lives Hate link CNN source, there's this:

 aren‚Äôt enrollment numbers zero upcoming semester? would seem almost students willing pay premium online Ivy League school. I'm surprised, months away November, really see lot great ads attacking pandemic response, think obvious slam dunk. Well, going quite swimmingly. know, set big example violent racists follow. I‚Äôm mistaken, didn‚Äôt government threaten revoke federal funding didn‚Äôt open? least say *tried* forced close due health concerns.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* insanity growing faster covid19 Edit: somewhat agree PPE. could could done there.

But testing / diagnostics, reality this:

They issue whatever orders demands want.

For rapid dna amplification diagnostics, small set manufacturers designs processes equipment manufacture systems. manufacturers already churning fast -- nowhere near fast various buyers would like.

No commandment US, god, master universe make manufacturers move faster. Ramping takes long time, especially talking regulated devices manufactured pursuant regulated audited standards.

Getting new manufacturers business would take long time. long neither private business government willing pony cash so, estimate time delivered equipment, crisis would done. 51 deaths Mississippi today. vote universal health care? They'd get sick less! That's terrible! aybe spark change never ending tuition inflation problem

No won't. problem government schemes offer loans guaranteed, payments inescapable. destroys lending market drastically raised prices past 20 years. whole point loans loan afford it, deny seen risk. risk socialized profits privatized, greatly inflates prices beyond anything sustainable. guy even pronounce Yosemite crying loud!?!!!?

People think ***HE*** Knows better doctors scientists such!?!? 

Him *books manuals* just.... even know anymore... Man, must easy argue make facts. judging mobility indexes.  Activity far normal. restaurants aren‚Äôt operating full capacity churches aren‚Äôt open doesn‚Äôt really count ‚Äúshut down‚Äù.  makes sense. confused arriving 33% conservative estimate. Neither US government government many states care people live die. Pretty sure apply colleges, CO.

‚ÄúCoronavirus upended everything on-campus college experience, including classroom debates, dorm life schedules. Students say reflected tuition bills.‚Äú suggest solutions? also keeping mind idea long term effects virus. Tell willing gamble kids safety? Cost business USA USA USA USA always heard ""if manage survive armed forces, VA gets try kill you."" compromised immune system I've wearing mask public transit years. doable, people buy necessity. We've seen well that's going States. actually zero deaths Jim?

No we're reporting did.  think they're going better whole class quarantined? Maybe multiple occasions? hope loses job I'm really worried. right here, strike. save lives. Precisely.

I'm currently lowly adjunct, even I'm forced teach face-to-face semester union worked deal administration waaaay back Spring semester Fall would entirely online. give concession annual raises potential loss revenue (and adjuncts get anyway), overall relief. Happy union times like these. Lots people talking mask part prolonged social distancing part primarily worrisome. ok making masks norm know long keep physical distancing rule due widespread fatigue spikes mental health issues. still hope degree normalcy (not exactly pre-COVID) terms physical contact back vaccines start coming mental health worsened considerably since March. brothers school North Carolina going route to. working ass converting science lessons super easy teach online, online format. thankful school district sacrificing ""kids can't get virus."" summer time, summer tons tons festivals province. wonderful wise government doest want lose money damage already damaged economy.

Its stupid, everyone knows stupid, Quebec money hungry ways provinces aren't. Oddly enough, streptococcus crazy insane complications various body systems. It‚Äôs asinine, mention occasionally argued PANDAS syndrome strep wreaks habit brain. Severe long lasting complications alone. 

So yes, viruses bacteria complications mostly untreated finishing antibiotics. coronavirus however major switch seems symptoms vary person person complications large swing different individuals. point time can‚Äôt even predict sick show mild symptoms all. It‚Äôs crapshoot every time go out... mention there‚Äôs guarantee won‚Äôt catch less/more severe symptoms next go round. 

What‚Äôs really gonna mess us Cold Flu season literally carry symptoms signs SARS-Cov2 got tested Friday night ER unrelated visit Kaiser facility got results back Sunday night  Things? things? issue time price. would additional charges availability. Man - would love it. wife nurse work government love job all. could stay home dad keep house keep shape cook shit... I'd love it! Guy pulled stats ass fit argument like trump interview. arrive 0.1% figure cherrypicking data dishonest, ways:

1. Adjusting number cases account asymptomatic individuals COVID recovered without ever tested, without also adjusting death rate way.

2. using case rate / death rate low age brackets likely recover, assuming stats apply ages, don't.

3. Straight lowering number deaths believe government/hospitals/etc. inflating numbers. 

It's weird many people want downplay pandemic much. Weird sad. live US some, lack testing = less positive cases ultimately defeated Covid19. away silly social distance face mask BS

Although comment silly, unfortunately many leaders banking on. drugs COVID-19 clinical studies think best shot working? Also, thought wearing mask mouth helps keep droplets dispersed others, wearing nose helps keep virus particles entering nose (which receptors ACE 2, therefore likely COVID-19 enter.) make scientific sense? (I layperson, scientist.) paste whole text, kinda long article, here's good excerpt origins, although article follows thread present day. anti-science bias come from? became rooted Southern culture politics Scopes Trial, popularly known Monkey Trial, 1925 Dayton, trial stemmed modernism rising post-World War era. Southern whites felt changes challenged way life, including seeing teaching evolution attack traditional values. moved aggressively retain socio-cultural control time transformative change limiting modern influences. Parents send kids school they're sick time. Sometimes can't stay home watch (forced wageslavery), sometimes think child's faking it, sometimes they're soulless monsters. Protecting worst (death) may sufficient. could still cause long term problems people suffering from.

I really hope thats case, effectiveness determine continue distancing masks afterwards. still 2 months ago? got tested got results within 24 hours. highschool walked halls shoulder shoulder, crowded literally push/swim way sea kids. Asking safely person classes seems like asking fit Toyota Corolla bedroom closet. even discussion? School last one unit math. imagine end unit test would bring lot ""symptoms"". Kids stayed home sick time without pandemic going on. I'm glad too! let'see continues going since clubs still open shake fucking head, strike moment reopening announced, bad system poor teachers balls can't even that.

stay strong. Genuine question anyone ideas topic. If/when schools close down, parents going children? first months quarantine Canada mess parents continued working returned work places children go. There's significant amount people can't afford children go daycare/have babysitter entire school year. truly see going work anybody worlds bank corporate criminals it‚Äôs amazing well economy floats. Lyme disease well lmao take measly upvote. Facts stop people taking gospel bad thing unless kid gets sick needs hospitalized. Otherwise, good thing immune least short term, probably long term, builds herd immunity. quite. ""Reported"" corona virus cases drop significantly

Real numbers stubborn habit remaining real. think that's usual zombie set-up, right? grateful virus (yet) create zombies. Merely quoting Alfred Lord Tennyson, eh? curious- know plane ? what's long term solution

In USA/Europe schools high risk infection flu-like viruses.

They arn't high risk Australia. Perhaps USA/Europe look what's different schools operate hypothetically there's vaccine?

If asking hypothetical questions, would virus mutates lethal children. Deal hypotheticals known. County infamous summer camp happened released opening plan, mask social distancing kids. problem though. One side says ""kids get virus"" side says ""kids extremely low risk"".

Both sides seem completely miss point whether concerned kids stop fact kids still spread viruses. required use bleaching product type wet tile like shower. Usually Comet powder soft scrub stuff. Wednesday numbers almost always higher since cross check different registers Tuesday afternoons. Seven day average 4, corresponds 132 deaths population US size. US seven day average 1130 deaths increasing. Or, here's crazy thought, people infected STAY FUCK HOME. :) headline suggests child infected first day school worthless clickbait headline article. test equals results. would thought??? 4 coronavirus based ‚Äúcolds‚Äù FYI. consider common cold actually variety different viruses. rhinovirus aren‚Äôt.

Having said that, yes think it‚Äôs long shot. Maryland near 1 day already lived Chris Christie ‚Äúfire bad teachers‚Äù campaign. fuck head closed bridges closed beaches 4th July, despite beach 4th July Thank you, Chicago! 

Other schools: stop fucking trying murder teachers students. 1,000 students heard every 100 carried weapon - you‚Äôd cancel school. Yet ignore potential lethality COVID-19. bringing new point own, responding you‚Äôd said that. Sorry wasn‚Äôt clear.

It‚Äôs point it‚Äôs stupid laymen start rattling opinions disease. mindset creates anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. don‚Äôt need armchair experts. Assume worst, hope best. don‚Äôt understand testing works blows mind little school district/government cares, live third world country we're online classes notice. Yes. won‚Äôt go hospitals. They‚Äôll fine. They‚Äôll go home wait virus‚Äô course. Please. explosions. Ok, trump cult member? charge behavior cult. Teachers like valuing narrow minded views education lives students bonkers. I'm going keep saying over: choice life death.  choosing death problem need dealt over. Kid already positive going school, makes sense virus come somewhere school initially Yeah OC China better knockoff Missouri China /s True man sensible governments closed schools. Plus Norway Finland recovered faster. Looking one segment time hardly captures total impact strategy. Quick, everyone: put best surprised face. today's news: grass green sky blue. know, maybe elementary school children concept personal space also plenty contact adults elderly vastly higher chance severe consequences? Maybe thing evidence suggests thing life-long immunity infected once? perhaps even young people die result virus there's evidence long-time negative effects? course, let's continue downplay pandemic already taken 150.000 national companions afterlife earlier to. I'm sure work well. Kind of.

We closed borders non-white travelers, government trying justify human rights breaking offshore processing centres years UN criticizing. soon wealthy white people returning suddenly found could rent entire hotels quarantine, people saying, much cheaper millions-of-dollars-per-head offshore island facilities. broke England &amp; America, government shrugged let travelers pour in. That's cases came from.

However federal government led fairly low-intelligence evangelical stooge, wanted avoid lockdowns mega religious services sports games scheduled appearances political purposes. personally went schools closing tried get reopen.

It states stepped forced hard lockdown borders schools. big ones done it, smaller states followed along, thankfully.

Now however virus starting explode breaking one biggest cities, right wing spent months demanding everything opened back up, people apparently pushed pointless welfare job application seeking etc despite well known jobs severe short supply right why.  hear? Children resilient China Virus get sniffles running next day keep seeing posts wondering early kids go school days. New Jersey reporting July. Idk remember going back late August kid. Anyway kid virus beforehand probably tested beforehand. think colleges requiring nose swabs coming back maybe public schools well really still people like thinking bad people dumb things ones paying virus? august already, evolve. Get ya flu shot go parties less 100 people without masks attendance.   half front page: Teachers often can't afford leave jobs everyone brain though. Maybe stay home you‚Äôre concerned. take joy reporting people? think kids were? Tons child care settings fundamentally different schools. people America can't work remotely can't afford hire private nannies. public schools go remote, kids going zoom school day cares afterschool programs. It'd HUGE difference. We'd still fully funded, non-politicized CDC. We'd still White House pandemic task force. We'd national test trace strategy. We'd robustly deployed DPA provide sufficient PPE testing availability. could go on... is. It‚Äôs easy get work visa enter USA either, actually, even for, example, highly skilled professional STEM PhD. (I lot South American PhD colleagues &amp; trade stories details move either direction). It‚Äôs pretty difficult directions; example it‚Äôs hard work Brazil, &amp; it‚Äôs equally hard Brazilians work US.

Anyway, particular issue pretty easy manage adding ‚Äúage points‚Äù system visa applications, like Canada, New Zealand, &amp; bunch 1st world countries have. USA ever fully enact global healthcare I‚Äôd board adding sort system, i.e. applicants immigration docked progressively points older. Canada example pretty effective system combines age points, language points (fluency French), family points (family already Canada), firm job offer + necessary skill set field Canada shortage (nurses example). 

Alternatively there‚Äôs Costa Rica model buy way huge chunk $, order pay participation health care system. really gonna wait kids start dieing realize shit idea.  Great points! Wow, could seen coming? I've seen mention 75% heart damage statistic, seen study headline. 

It sounds like comment headline potentially deceiving, care put proper context me? too! freaking right thinking seems there‚Äôs lot people. smell things taste it‚Äôs 100%. went local Urgent Care, appointment. seen 20 minutes results half hour later. rapid tests now. Yes. Emergency teaching credentials would awarded contract-hourly ‚Äúteachers‚Äù BA need paycheck. school what?   Kids must stay INSIDE times! can‚Äôt take risk unknown VIRUS!! mom teacher couple years retirement... dont know last heard Charlotte, NC (which spiking) planning open school, force everyone registered go. 2 weeks close go virtual least rest semester.  


Like WTF point opening 2 weeks closing? make sure expose everyone? thinks good idea? 


No mention stupid logistics all, force teachers supply setup classroom knowing used 2 weeks, food cafeteria, like much stuff, much money could saved virtual whole time. sound like ok sacrificing people pay big business. husband got tested CVS minute clinic Atlanta July. got results back yesterday. took 19 days. husband still waiting his. Absolutely ridiculous pointless get results back point actually end positive. mentioned thread I‚Äôll repeat - March, Florida hosted Daytona Bike Week nothing happening. Similar numbers, distancing, masks. Obviously SD fewer people FL also means fewer resour da deal effects Contact tracing would nightmare test kits give results 10 minutes. actually I‚Äôve giving friends family. Ever heard sommarsemester? Means fewer people gathering cities, schools workplaces.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Hospitalizations numbers affected change reporting. However, obvious method making numbers go (less testing) seem happening level. no, lets discuss 6 months more. discuss rain makes wet. Smart move. really hot south August. Like really hot, leaving A/C day unless kind hot. go back August since going inside day anyways. Get May weather nice enough outside. two elderly aunts Tennessee get test results back three weeks. they'd actually virus, could died buried then.

I think also wait couple days asking get tested first place. Yeah forget insurance driver bus. 
I short term gig bus driver. Starting pay $15. private company, schools would probably pay little less would care test scores first foremost anyway? There's urgent care local offers test results 24 hours. They're affiliated hospital, lab. course correct. actual PCR done quite simply given reagents.

It's detection bit gets tricky.  worst fear, keep thinking event similar 9/11, first responders gradually got sick developed illnesses related event screwed/(last remember) still screwed govt &amp; compensated supported.

Now imagine global level. know full effect months/years later then, try ignore move like 9/11 first responders? gonna cripple future generations (which guess I'm apart of) certainly make hopeful future. We‚Äôve since March figure out. There‚Äôs viable plan. Unless city wants positivity rate climb back up, they‚Äôll keep schools closed least get day testing close it. go route opening schools again, might well reopen indoor dining point. half bars restaurants aren‚Äôt going survive fall winter anyway. remember scene. Fucking chilling keep hearing black Latino communities getting hit harder white ones. I‚Äôm Ca. fianc√© got results within 24 hours nasal swab drive thru.  Many locations newer tests give results anywhere 15 min instant now.
I've tested 4 times due exposure, first took weeks. Lately I've seen lot posts antibody cocktail, drugs extremely effective, etc etc 

I hate negative nelly I've positive long. actually going get stuff right see article article nothing seems progress farther that. got results day Seattle University Washington testing site. test 12pm, went online 6pm results there, called next morning talk result. efficient. Rona: üòé living Georgia last month test, got result within 48. Honestly, north west Atlanta testing clear, straight forward, accessible. Reserved time line, showed up, people scanned QR code, drove spot, took test still car, sent way. is.

These little kids teachers must sacrifice lives Republicans. Nos Morituri Te Salutamus! Getting people stop spreading fake news? reddit? know whether applaud laugh naivety.

And answer question. think schools reopening? test I've ""self administered"" saliva test. asked cough plastic cup.  startlingly high percentage students come top 20%, [per NY said, admissions need blind--meaning consider financial aid admissions process. Clearly need reform process, however, biased towards wealthy. (Not state obvious, wealthy students clearly *not* actually deserving average).

None changes makes sense make rich students pay makes sense give middle class students almost free education.  don‚Äôt get lol. many people get college degrees online become doctors. Kids can‚Äôt learn times tables home Months? certain point wonder effective take loss year make everyone repeat grade. can't imagine learning effectively. lol true...

The first case COVID county New York State got nursing home transferred COVID patient neighboring county local nursing home choice take in.  LETS GO, BROOKLYN STRONG!

Everyone still wearing masks, everyone still helping out, everyone still staying clean distant. Love hood peeps.

C'mon South get shit together. Like... one school bug's going round week several classmates school? university start year lectures full people coughing sneezing? 'Freshers flu' exists happens every year like clockwork. Key words, ""Waited numbers go down."" You‚Äôre describing completely different disease, one involved there‚Äôs serious complications, actual symptoms literally lists loss taste smell difference covid flu symptoms. want go Fauci CDC saying, don‚Äôt know tell you. bunch dead sick people also great economy. 42.0 minute delay fetching comments.

Wake people normal situation I‚Äôm quarantining single mom twice last 2 months try work stay home mom it‚Äôs fucking fun don‚Äôt help single parents running options Finally understand children comparatively less affected. Thats I'm saying. best theres nothing do. possible way Trump force companies manufacture PPE needed it. Impossible us implement funds directed states. Impossible implement mask mandate actually contain virus summer school started. Theres way could given healthcare people massive pandemic experts warning us decade.

The real problem us layman understanding differences two different types tests. 

Not lack national leadership.

The learn virus hard must stop! 1000 Americans dead every single day really control. Axios showed Trump knowledgeable top it. He's shit right.

You good looking problem context isolating garbage hone on. I'm glad thread help us out.

USA CORONAVIRUS NUMBER 1 BABY

Cool good. Um...do share mouthpiece places? 

&lt;pikachu work law school, teaching mandatory foreign language students. 

The amount times get threatend lawsuit ridiculous. 

Some examples:

""It right people watching us exams. LAWSUIT!""

""You can't chuck exam literally caught cheating. LAWSUIT!""

""What mean work lockdown? LAWSUIT!"" Explain rest state keeping numbers down. Magic? problem CDC can‚Äôt operate without fed money, every president mind cut budget. (Reagan) took hatchet CDC budget AIDS beginning go global. So, W H meddling CDC middle pandemic unprecedented üò£

And worse, serfdom, CDC influenced W H. 

That really needs change. CDC needs separated somehow who‚Äôs power can‚Äôt interfere vital linchpin public health. wait 10 days

That's enough time die already showing symptoms, Jesus. almost feels like ticking boxes checklist instead actually examining logistics preventing disease transmission. we'll *third* spike cases.

Kids go home, infect members family, everything gets worse. people masks coughing groceries. could hate more. Children dying isn‚Äôt really people concerned about. children fine, message throughout entire pandemic. people likely spread too, namely teachers families, much likely suffer. 

Whats likely going happen outbreaks occur areas reopened schools 2-3 weeks reopening sent back lockdown. 

This child likely infected throughout single day school. trying paint good thing didn‚Äôt get infected school. anything shows single infected kid entering spending time school building danger entire community.

Why characterizing sbout children's safety entire pandemic understand elderly preexisting conditions risk? seem page everyone else.

Thank god aren‚Äôt power don‚Äôt even seem understand real issue here.

This virus much deadlier flu general. killed nearly 3 times number people 5 months *the worst* flue season entire year. Yeah course doesn‚Äôt seem deadly limit deaths consider populations virus poses absolutely zero risk to. *daft* attempt use data argument. counting Finally sense. parent, absolutely would prefer kid class. think right, I'm left wondering disruptions make whole thing wash far we're trying accomplish sending kids back school. assuming anyone doesn‚Äôt speak English America immigrant, ignorant extreme. Yes students lose social networking opportunities

You mean entire justification cost? that? US, known winning! Edgy would mean fringe. approaching majority think consumerism/capitalism harm good society. :-P

Change coming. 1) even small percentage children die, would parent okay sending child? gets choose 14,000 kids get sent slaughter? worth risking anything year set curriculum taught online made later? Dying also isn‚Äôt issue. Many people permanent issues lungs, tasting, etc corona. 

2) Even children unlikely die it, studies show spread it. spread parents, grandparents, teachers, daycare workers. people much chance die anyone else. right population matters backlog tests might representative population. Number tests cue sure reason taking long places places things lot locked requiring lot tests. place like Georgia already generally open isn‚Äôt requiring many tests. mean order go work Washington, least company, tested every two weeks office course need justification. One customers Atlanta back office tests necessary. personally avoiding office problem idea long take buddy mine go weeks/months ago point took 3 days get results. also heard people say week others 2 days fluctuates wildly likely impacted heavily state regulations comes testing requirements.  24.7% world's prisoners seems bit... excessive?

We're #1? üëÜ only. I‚Äôd say people never responsible another living creature, let alone child. school mom teaches opening next week, dumbest shit time. They're going close fast (at least hope), keep pulling craziest shit. mom got email yesterday mandatory meeting massive auditorium EVERY TEACHER DISTRICT week school starts. It'll fucking hilarious turns someone sick can't even open exposed every single teacher go quarantine. ""She spoke condition anonymity... KSAT confirmed employment NISD."" WTF? Sadly, corona care absence solutions.

To answer question though, probably money feds spending people I‚Äôd thought workable hypothesis start. infections Princess Diamond clearly shows transmission path direct droplets. dead giveaway.  Texas one big Chuck Norris blow doll. Whatever Chuck says that‚Äôs vote. worries! I'm actually surprised positive attention got; much harder get personal surroundings interested understanding situation. pretty much like ""it's weeks, better right!? Let's go out!"".

&amp;#x200B;

To answer directly, given treatment, told rest. know thing existed doctor told it. roughly -40¬∞ temperature Fahrenheit Celsius. saying. Okay obviously going school time catching showing symptoms 2 weeks. parents send them!? Hotel stay family No. max less 5% per  Came say this. Tuskegee disgusting blemish American history. Shit, researchers still use unknowing people lab rats without consent. See ""harbinger zip codes"" quality part count, could get quality school 10 times cheaper. EDGY SHIT, FOLKS! know fact school districts started first day school least two known Coronavirus positive students came school. parents students notified. teachers simply told kids coming school.

 It‚Äôs fucking bonkers. ""Because cutting world \*years\*"" ""Some live fear decades"" believe years *decades*?

These kids able make choices trust parents them. knowing long term affects virus options education online still choosing send back school. seem like best long term option young kid. become sterile due would make difference you? suggested covid *but that's thing know yet*.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Spelling. Fuck spelling  Indeed is. think helps us understand stance FHM government little bit better. comment? antibody tests suggest 25% population NYC, 14-15% whole state. would roughly 3 million whole state 20 million people. Also, parts state outside NYC Erie county, live, estimate 5-6% keeping numbers well. precautions immunity playing role low case count. correct, also highly probable scenario Schools, hundreds students, dozens adults, famiies, way contact tracing works, likely scenario, 2nd week probably going ""oh shit bad idea"" week even contact tracing testing taken place related first week everyone pissed stuck quarantined. think remdesevir does?

Remdesevir anti-viral. part standard course treatment since like day one. bothered read article see trying *other drugs* protective effects cytokine storms inflammation.

I need clear talking past other. original response claim cytokine storms context ""a strong immune system puts higher risk"". found true COVID-19.

For reason many people idea COVID-19 like Spanish Flu, tens millions young people died likely overactive cytokine response. **This case COVID-19**. know many times needs said.

On top that, Dr. Fauci straight said *nobody knows* patients cytokine responses cause major problems. whole point discussion claim ""too healthy"" risk factor. proven even suggested data. know that? Im curious know that.  professor reused tests last semester uploaded student homework solutions without even asking. ask questions, respond condescending way possible. genuinely wonder hell he's getting paid TAs basically running class. social popularity? Where's slice cake, I'm 6'5 I'm fucking Larry. Man really hope relief. Pheonix then? Skip leafy vegetables, need turmeric supplement! They‚Äôve already got herd immunity.

Immunity good advice experts. I'm upstate NY usually see everyone teenagers wear mask Lower Spain, Italy, UK extensive lockdowns. Sweden densely populated compared Norway. fair comparison make direct neighbors Trumps banking vaccine, say ‚Äútold so, it‚Äôs going away now‚Äù idiots followers cheer. positive case close live. chance hell going completely shut schools. I‚Äôm closing schools, it‚Äôs realm possibilities area. Hong Kong perfectly safe. child tested Saturday (scary ER visit), got call following Wednesday state health department negative result. seems depend location exactly get tested. Ha, thanks that. must know doctor.

Edit: typo wow, really? mean people nuked systems susceptible?! Yeah question beginning been, ""So, long list contingencies?"" happens kid it? family member? teacher? Staff member. shut classroom? grade level? school? long? Say shut two days two weeks. kids come back. kids staff going sick (because that's probability), going start again. Taking temps stop it. Staggered schedules space desks stop it. threshold infections plan give shut again? impossible situation. 

My kid going kindergarten, plan keeps changing, one predict 2-3 weeks advance. latest delaying actual start year three weeks, presumably give teachers time learn virtual classroom tools, give district time secure enough iPads chromebooks hotspots. Then, start, going run first eight weeks completely virtual. So, kids city home least early November. 

But joke. know going. kids going school. What's going happen November makes in-person attendance possible? Cold &amp; flu season? everyone coughing sniffing sneezing?

Then maybe leave Thanksgiving return January. what? they've 2 1/2 months asynchronous virtual education (these elementary school kids, mind you), there's nothing magical calendar saying 2021.

I imagine potential vaccines make difference traditional school year (next summer), kidding optimism kids school year? see it. places try. district watch them, learn them, inevitably force state legislature allow run whole year remotely. awful everyone. get bad kids (from homes socioeconomic backgrounds) stay home. get bad working parents economy. see inevitable. let's agree we're going there, parents false sense light end tunnel.  We're fucked. We've fucked. life now. thing help us get money time. get tests within 48 hours we‚Äôre going numbers. ton testing sites though, they‚Äôre usually packed. There‚Äôs many people country, including president believe waste time. 

We mandated forced folks abide. 

This larger national emergency since 9/11. 3000 die, gotta get violated TSA. 

150,000 die fuck masks? 

Fuck that. Wear mask, let‚Äôs mandate shit. Seriously, listening interview epidemiologist said gloves surface cleaning general ya know... good, almost useless actually preventing transmission. I'm trying say necessarily good move Southwest, sure doom gloom comments portraying as. current circumstances even scarier. services even happening indoors right now? WWJD? understand, I'm sorry hear. also preparing chronic, difficult time. lucky. Take care! insanity due covid brain What's making parents risk sending children school? education life? know even mild cases COVID lead life long damage? Like damage heart lining strokes, etc.? yet, theme parks Florida open month without outbreaks all.

I think 'foregone conclusion' biased. proper distancing protocols enforced, outbreak. Guys guys think joke. laughed. pandemic ruined hopes many millionaires simply hoping billionaires one day. sounds like something punished house arrest and/or punishment delayed, etc. etc. Yeah ,I actually enjoy life, day watching match friends great time. sure that. That's people said 2016. baffled kids charge yet seem considered far pitfalls people charge shit. Yeah, bunch teachers get sick and/or die. shit. know though right? 

What threshold acceptable child death? anything community??? Trying point wrong would take long. fact even spout BS makes realize worth time try change mind. ‚ÄúIf die,.. die‚Äù

-Ivan (Trump) Drago 50 protesters.


Did organize? city 600,000? way rest world looks America that's fine I'd like take look that. Got link? Google want give up. end well I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs hope. I‚Äôm saying we‚Äôre experiencing culturally traumatic event. Events COVID scar society rewrite culturally grapple stuff. 

I never said would socially distance mask forever, changes society. People can‚Äôt expect us go fucked event, change society bit. 


It‚Äôs really disingenuous say I‚Äôm level anti maskers. Last checked, I‚Äôm spreading COVID folks. stopped surprise trump voted teacher don‚Äôt understand ALL, staff students don‚Äôt get tested returning? Wouldn‚Äôt make sense? mean, school us doesn‚Äôt start month, people traveling such...wouldn‚Äôt make logical sense mandate testing want go back school? illegal missing something? Honest question. Q  can't assume study control obvious biases brief, third-hand, pop news article mention it. Pastor established remain way quite time. They've shifted Jareds original plan kill democrats, kill poor democrats 

If poor Republicans die well, acceptable stock market basically representation optimistic rich well stock market near future. love multiple glove technique, used day-to-day situations well experience kind investigations? Unfortunately, yes, that's also likely going happening. Statistically-speaking, 3.2 million teachers US, assuming 25% infection rate (800,000 infected) roughly 3% mortality rate (160,000 deaths 4.85 million infected US), looking approximately 24,000 dead teachers school year. Feel free play numbers (different infection rate, different mortality rate). Even much optimistic scenario (say 10% infection rate 1% mortality rate), still looking 320 dead teachers.

There's getting around it, we're choosing kill teachers year opening schools. what? going do? Replace **all** teachers? That's strikes effective.

The thing stops strike people willing cross picket line. Strikes made rules like this. know works get vaccine getting chickenpox. 

We know sure vaccine prevents shingles old age. know vaccine reduces shingles children 78%. protection last old age? We'll wait see. No, friend mine asked sit interview direct Supervisor since would working person eventually hired, also think direct Supervisor grooming tske role retires. don‚Äôt take 16personalities test seriously goal get parents unemployment. Then, schools return, they‚Äôll ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù quit jobs take care kids, that‚Äôs another homeless hungry family Trumpville near you, they‚Äôll ineligible collect.

This country fucking evil, always assume worst motive possible. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre stalling pass new stimulus, too. Let short term desperation lead long term starvation extreme poverty.

Before corona, 10% NYC schoolchildren homeless part every school year. cruelty point. *""The Arizona School Risk Retention Trust, also known Trust, approved plan add coverage additional contribution premium vary depending district size.""*

Yes, sure offer insurance... calculate appropriate extra amount. question school afford Covid insurance? thought getting free...lol cancelled Disney plus due gave reason. It‚Äôs drop bucket people stopped supporting reckless companies would better place. think everyone else saying ""take saying completely ignore it"". Oh trust raised again! 73-75 last reports, 67 June, \*\*some\*\* people speculating sign ""change direction"". would u remove driver? anything! Also,you paying shit dosen't sue ass. averaging one million cases every 13 days. huge amount statistics available impact mouth covering transmission droplets. Religious Burka/nijabs forms mouth covering. really simple. They've already made vaccine Flu. Manufacturers start make prediction believe Virus strain be. 

From CDC: Getting vaccinated July August early, especially older people, likelihood reduced protection flu infection later flu season. September October good times get vaccinated. However, long flu viruses circulating, vaccination continue, even January later.

I usually get mine October. right accurate Yeah...it‚Äôs gotta tough state getting hit hard everyone around believing it‚Äôs fake news.

We got hit hard beginning, 100 covid patients personally shit miserable. support state though. don‚Äôt think people truly understand bad is, especially older populations communities. BrO tRiEd yOga Capitalism right there. mention surgical masks extremely easy breathe through. everyone wearing one, they‚Äôre safe enough protect population. People saying can‚Äôt breathe want take dog plane it‚Äôs ‚Äúemotional support animal‚Äù even tho certification way enforced. üòî think keep relevant &amp; face there. tithes mostly automated days 

Either way, it‚Äôs horrible &amp; selfish decision situation teachers shortly. Except health care workers proper PPE (sometimes) able take precautions try spend much time near Covid positive patients distance. Teachers supplied medical grade PPE, masks school gave joke. student comes school infected close contact 6 hours straight. children thought carry higher amounts virus. seems like teachers could risking even higher viral load health care workers. 

Thankfully young relatively healthy overweight enough considered high risk. didn‚Äôt sign shit. know kids months back fourth discussion countless policy changes heard next nothing trying keep teachers safe. doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone remotely concerned this. teachers unions secured us extra sick days, that‚Äôs it. 

The students school also severe behavioral issues. told permitted assign disciplinary action refusal wear mask. person faculty meetings apparent coworkers incapable practicing social distancing, students certainly able to. I‚Äôm scared shitless family. I‚Äôm hoping numbers spike quick, everyone realizes mistake schools close soon open. Agreed too. I‚Äôm introvert, play lot video games, don‚Äôt go much best times. even would willing socially distance 3 years. That‚Äôs fucking fairly tale. I‚Äôm married, don‚Äôt dream job, life isn‚Äôt squared away yet, neither almost anyone else‚Äôs certain age average (40, 50? older even?). I‚Äôve followed every guideline recommendation since March, I‚Äôve stayed home isolated done part. I‚Äôm giving 3 years life this. Especially I‚Äôm vaccinated. That‚Äôs absolute farce. should‚Äôve pandemic. Wtf man Bastard bloody thing. ghastly strategy war kill enemy soldiers, wound them, enemy's resources depleted rescuing caring wounded? No, try tell 3 years go Browns game, another 2 years vaccine lets say, people flat tell experts fuck off. vaccine, things coming back, one keeping social distancing game vaccinations ""herd immunity"" level told us exactly plan openly stated we‚Äôd ‚Äúonly lose fifteen thousand children‚Äù. leaves plenty ‚Äúhuman capital stock‚Äù. Kid went school Monday, started showing symptoms Monday night, got rapid test Tuesday came back positive. Nothing says contracted school. Sorry good enough anymore.  exactly virus control.  options deal ones like guess what? fucking god damn bad.  People need start thinking long term instead fixating effects now.  way going survive this.  going hard going hurt better fucking dead.  forget weekend dips cases collected. Weekly averages better Yuck. mother-in-law still us two years stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis. really amazing advances, owe lot doctors, Keytruda Obamacare keeping us. There's gotta better way phrase title. 85% parents district opted send kids person classes, per article. immediately.

For starters, still vulnerable covid weeks getting shot 3 front runners North America. immediately ditch social distancing right vaccination, likely get sick get bunch people sick.

Furthermore, rate people willing get vaccine create herd immunity. means compromised immune systems still vulnerable virus, even vaccinated, shot eradicating covid combination social distancing vaccination. shot eradicating vaccine market. But, requires people social distance, especially getting vaccine all. Whats point going ignore everything doesn‚Äôt suit already made mind pre written internal narrative? think teachers given another name then. expendables? mention bridgegate beachgate. heat/cool many buildings, infrequent cleaning need significantly reduces costs associated them. advancements cancer medications absolutely astonishing mask order call park non emergency police line didn‚Äôt mean say it‚Äôs impossible spread way, highly unlikely compared contact someone actually infected. Mainly don‚Äôt like cleaning surfaces frequently touted preventative measure, simultaneously trying cram many people close together possible. someone sitting next flight sick, doesn‚Äôt matter well cleaned seat flight, high risk catching this. ‚ÄúPlease let us reopen! We‚Äôll follow ever necessary safety procedure!‚Äù days go start new academic year, schools around country rushing gather materials never thought would need: plexiglass dividers, piles masks internet hot spots connect students remotely.



We're expecting would one day disappear? Magically, like miracle?


If hate liars like anti-maskers hate liars, Giant Emperor Oompah Loompah Land may applying new job Nov 4. Hurricane locked things pretty good no? ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù - President Donald J Trump. scientist (Don Milton) currently trying culture covid19 air also consulted design airplane air filtration systems. explains flaws design would fly.

That's likely. crisis devolved free all. much hated slogan (and cynical commercials used it), much preferred prefer ‚Äúwe‚Äôre together‚Äù phase pandemic what‚Äôs happening now. I'm surprised people seems depend lot provider. results next day, two weeks. like Kemp ""who know asymptomatic people?!"" early GD April. KNEW SINCE FEBRUARY DUDE! Canada, probably. pretty quick begin with, given health huge surprise. said issues got covid add least Hong Kong, Isra√´l, Iran...

Also, first wave south Africa, Algeria, Morocco... still going on. say party freed african americans slavery. republican party. know trump say yesterday ""I‚Äôve Done Blacks John Lewis ever did"". know must party stands something, picks right people modern america, right?...... Right?........ agree totally. drives nuts people treating virus casually. know little long term effects. 

I liken new animal emerged blue, everyone started hunting eating without knowing was. Lots people getting sick eating it, even dying, yet people continue eat it. virus different? Next thing start requesting doctors wear surgery. It‚Äôs slippery slope people. Former flight attendant. completely true. Think dirty diapers everywhere. parents prepared schools
To close two small children I‚Äôm 100% ready school teaching year think quicker tests priorities, although hear they're less accurate. theyre probably using children, try get quicker idea working. idea bubble cities NHL. LOL, see ;P great headline.

Emergency use reserved emergency situations, like China temporarily approved one vaccine military only. is, levels infection reaches point cripples health system, might go last resort (or precautions get military conflict). think anybody planning rush get with. already full story, confusing two separate points.

FDA *might* allow emergency approval successful candidates, yet *does not* mean cutting corners lowering standards. Emergency approval still *some* standards involved. It‚Äôs naive think otherwise. let Trump run federal troops US think power doesn‚Äôt matter.  forget Instagram photo Pedal Bar - always requirement. got whooping cough despite fully vaccinated. one unlucky ones. also got whooping cough bunch idiots decided vacxinate kids area years back.

I'll first line let 50% effective vaccine. concern lot people won't. I'd help could, conspiracy theorist wackos, tired them, hate It‚Äôs population positive cases, population deaths. India 1.35 something billion people. 320 something million. 3 million positive cases, 120,000 deaths. 

Now totally debate accuracy number, amount deaths counted towards Covid evident future based average deaths per year, unconfirmed cases. But, much like election 40% precincts reporting, declare United States winner. India‚Äôs numbers would factor 10 compete. Person ""You wanna stay hotel?"" 

Person B ""Nah, dozens people died pandemic, probably haunted"" vast majority viruses‚Äô immunity last! coronavirus lasts 17+ years! You‚Äôre able find one exception even one lasts long enough issue current short term policy. argument. You‚Äôre reacting based fear science. &amp;#x200B;

And God invented Xanax.

And even better invented cannabis. Perfect situations. think gave directly community use chicken not. like everything else - are. Generalizing wont help much. Yes!!! see phrase ""underlying medical conditions"" used basically blame victim demise. multiple medical conditions, chose get absolutely none them. nothing could done prevent them. could, think fucking would have??? no, can't cured, either.

This pandemic hard many reasons, one came see many people see life value, die, matter many precautions take, something deserve it. Lol way 6 million infected lockdown 3 months. Also like said CDC says 0.65% totally dismissed made 0.2%. dont know enough immunology form rebuttal wouldnt sound like talking ass, think saying zero deaths isnt good thing bit callous. NY achieved hard immunity, thing possible right now, that's also good thing. dont want trivialize hard work hospital staff, people recovered people still fighting. feeling got said. Idk intention upfront. know store offers mask latter specification? Unfortunately 4dflexisport one ship EU-wide :( favorite viral fact: Measles weaken immune system several months ‚Äúrecovered.‚Äù erases stored immunities. chicken pox kid, contracting measles make susceptible again.

Alcohol actually tastes much better home spend equivalent one night bar get smashed weekend top shelf booze. 

And kitchen uses better quality ingredients decide order food. 

And I‚Äôm one hitting wife staring ass making dinner without pants on. 

So it‚Äôs win/win/win. Dude, even like Bernie, public pay vaccine global pandemic, time place make money one. dunno, nursing home deaths account least 40% 30,000. direct result NYS policy. think gets pass LOL. that's wisest strategy. send source?  white house: OH NO!.anyway...... think eradicating disease possible? Dude like staying indoors say wtf must frightening work since infected bodies everything touched infected also. Even better look Japan. 1000 cases 0 deaths since start pandemic. Also New Zealand COVID free since think last month. Honestly medical field still doesn‚Äôt know. need time see long immunity lasts. now, even antibodies keep mask stay vigilant. June 1/3rd kids back school told.

Seems like she‚Äôs concerned contact tracing isolation stop spread rather actually try prevent infection. reactive method working far, don‚Äôt want kid one risk infection province worried dealing infection fact taking better precautions happen first place.

At rate tho, can‚Äôt get handle rising cases here, we‚Äôll much worse backlash parents going much greater. kid smart - worried. thing every country got control masks, distancing, targetted shutdowns, control people coming country, massive undertakings promote hand washing systematic cleaning surfaces. know combination works evidence show surface transmissions less likely originally feared, know people infected way, know cleaning part combination solutions works. like. Maybe southwest spray clorox planes high touch areas, know?  Fuck yeah, take back baby understand concept. need balance risk asymptomatic spread ‚Äî minimal young kids ‚Äî need keep schools open. Understand? [The world Ugh sentiment bugs much. everyone saying rationing triage, *still* denying care based someone's actions beliefs. young dumb (or old misinformed, etc) carry death sentence. Yes, they're assholes yes worse risk taking affects others. deny ICU care drunk drivers. Thank god punitive reddit commenters decide hospital admissions. Eh - really good phase 1 data. I'm guessing new biotech, check Novovax's historic phase 1 data... 2 Phase 3 whiffs RexVax. promising phase 2 data vaccine (more robust we're looking here).

So - either people debbie downers know phase 1 studies nice absolutely looked HUGE grain salt - especially considering Novavax's history. (probably bit Sadly probably picked parent took child enrollment, tens hundreds kids going well. Lol. you‚Äôre *that* level concerned, think stay locked house next year. disability exempt masks. hearing attorney!!!! They'll get numbers worry. 8 hours day. one room. Also they‚Äôre kids won‚Äôt listen desperate touch other. plexiglass. need actually learn something. Go. Indeed, low community spread critical re-opening schools Seriously? Calm down. Like said, absolutely think states surging cases (read: them) school still online. state Vermont, hand, daily new cases typically single digits went 43 days without death. One person whole state currently hospitalized. safe get pandemic. top that, school starting hybrid model extensive safety precautions including mandatory PPE staff students, social distancing, frequent handwashing sanitizing, etc. 100% comply willingly regulations safe possible. get situation much better people, wanted share experience viewpoint special educator online learning detrimental students' educations. better death? Absolutely, still sucks. COVID COVID God attention seeking COVID deniers ... sorry education ONLINE now!! get contaminated virus students want spend time drinking together... Hurricane shut labs testing centers.

Plus florida probably lying bit ‚Äú

In Le Bert‚Äôs study, patients appeared retained reactive cells nearly two decades. colleagues write report potentially significant implications: immunity acquired through, say, vaccine could last many months years. 
‚Äú lol sure bud. can't deal 2 years minor inconvenience? might well end all!!! try guys, then. sweet sweet tuition money!  Also Trump: ""I take responsibility."" damn videogames... obvious answer, sure think earlier. son law hobbled federal tracing testing efforts thought virus would kill Democrats Maybe schools closed? want risk life children? I'm starting think great depression would better. never able prove got Covid-19 flight

That exactly job contact tracers.

I know they'd bother given circumstance, person person B flight, compare genetic profiles. *scribbles tiny hands* newer ones 24h Staying comments...I needed good laugh. Bless all. Isn‚Äôt room temperature like 110 /s Actually, I'm curious. know cases reflect actual number people infected, care they're dropping not? **This AMA begin 11am EST. Please refrain answering questions guest. Thank you.** Survey SAYS- wear fuckin mask cover sneezes! post higher sub? great news Nah. soon get vaccine I‚Äôm good. don‚Äôt want take choke ventilator care. mean... that's exactly issue. One kid tests positive, could spread 5. 5 even know days, likely continue spread meantime. get tested, time tests come back, could already run course virus -- going school getting others sick meantime. Suddenly 1 case 50 -- that's kids, counting guardians, people guardians encounter still going stores work taking precautions. expedite tests people entering hospitals. Nope, 100% accurate. What's hard staying home? I'm saying there's vaccine lets say 2023, then? ever able eradicate virus plethora reasons highly contagious play safe 3 years? Interested hear response. Yep good stuff :) think world look like vaccine released available general public?

 We'd like magic stick-and-go-back-to-restaurants-and concerts, doubt we'd get anything magic like that. So, estimation, think things be? 3 good points, people forget #1 #2 related. possible open businesses observe careful social distancing (AND WEARING MASKS).

Japan (and Taiwan Singapore and....) cases control even though kept businesses mostly open. something close, reopened quickly. Why? masks.

So yes, complain ""stores closing, small business owners going bankrupt"" next breath complain masks. economy masks. reason can't economy want masks. Yeah, really disagree that. new virus, _may_ as-yet unknown consequences, application precautionary principle authorities may choose keep schools closed. think matter weighing costs / benefits situation imperfect data. also known costs keeping schools closed. Anyway, issue original quote preferring ""students dumb alive educated dead"" evidence child's chances dying covid-19 low. get tested pretty much reason now?  Unfortunately advice authority figures. cousin home health worker. patient hospitalized Covid developed cough. wait 10 days test results, chest x-rays clear fever, told keep going work waiting results. wear mask use hand sanitizer. 
(Meanwhile, husband told take results back, even though exposure symptoms. tested would allowed building colonoscopy.) unfortunately consistency telling people do. Iirc around 50% even develop temperature. That's security theater anything. virus make taller. know 'tall person only' coughing clubs. Witches weren‚Äôt real. Irresponsible, dumb ass parents real. There's thing line CVS however. give honest answers, told can't tested time. asymptomatic. Ask know. live California People downplaying negative impact virtual learning.  simply saying death worse fixable problem educating children.  None fucking matters virus control again.  understand right?  virus going continue spread like wildfire killing infecting thousands including people public schools people bicker effective virtual learning is. god fear kids work absolutely fucked. ""I get it. supposed know whether cases continue trend down?""

It also explains Swedes whole reacts FHM:s ( Swedish Healt authority / Swedish CDC) recommendations. Deaths mostly plateaued starting day feds changed reporting handling agency. 

The feds control state-level reporting, easily verifiable county/local level. fall fake news. yea sure kids go school PROBLEM.  
Only side might kill parents schools important kids must go getting 30 daily (that tested) we're opening schools come September. 

It's pretty much guarentee 30-40 kids class covid school Honestly don‚Äôt care 160k would care 40k really matter COVID-19 anyway. Deaths per case also deflated massive growth cases. long testing keeps up, new cases increasing every single day deaths lagging behind means pretty much outracing death toll. 

If constant 4% people infected dies cases stable 100/day, reach steady state roughly 4 people die per day, 100 people infected, there's 4% death rate. cases increasing 10%/day, time 4/100 die 2 weeks later, already almost 400 new cases per day. 4 die, 400 new infections... 1% death rate? biggest amazement fast test results came back academic report pandemic happened 90s might effect, saying people know happened 100 years ago learn kind silly. Like understand know history different reading older family member actually telling it. Agreed. I'm ambulance, girlfriend mother teachers, sister works retail. need vaccine yesterday. First story made sick (the threats received), outpouring support prompted White post video store‚Äôs Facebook page asking people stop trying send money.

That's good guess. Unfortunately, board answer one since I'm teacher, can't tell sure. Catchy title. kid likely exposed school opened. don‚Äôt get exposed test positive day. hotels, many years bring pillowslip, make sure wash hands using remote control, disinfect phone etc.

I've years. wipe everything arrival, allow maid service every day minimize often put stuff away stranger comes touches it.

I doubt housekeeping staff want best, constrained time supplies given work with. accidentally leave backpack car thats ‚Äúit is‚Äù don‚Äôt go ‚Äúoops‚Äù kill 150k Americans. Doesn‚Äôt take *few* days order virus settle tested (antibodies)?

So got went school. Got it, let‚Äôs blame schools though!!! 

ORANGE REPUBLICANS BAD!!!

Completely disregard blue democrats NYC banned HCQ sent people into
Nursing homes sick - big deal! Ironically, administrations probably use lawsuits online learning justify hiring consultants, assistants, nieces nephews - thus ‚Äúrequiring‚Äù tuition hikes. Florida Gov. DeSantis managed absolve entire botched Florida pandemic response mentioning single erroneous death certificate therefore casting doubt numbers administration charge of. 7000 Florida COVID deaths also motorcycle crashes, logic? children too, suppose? Good politicians populace incredibly weak minded. ""open safely"" first adults must show interact without creating epidemic. is, new cases school district zero. 

Then open safely. second case detected school community ( Staff, students circles), school isolates 14 days online work flare gone.

So, want open safely? Unite unity purpose eradicate Coronavirus communities.

Else we'll keep flip-flopping cure vaccine arrives. (Treatment continually improvinga nd vaccines looking great) - brought pro life party fully wish issues them, perhaps they'll instead ventilators. find one. point - say someone closely affected covid - Parents fault sending kids school. end day parent responsible child's safety. Yes, government shit show is. recognize shit show, though, go along it?

They boycotted semester home schooled children. kids kept home school shut down. went private school started 2002 18k year. time graduated 26k (4 years). like 50-60k last saw. (had cousin-in-law went year semester something) said where? Lol Quick go edit said make right. Unless states get page, continue. Az, went corner/convenience store 7 people masks around necks, faces. asked cashier sign said they're required, said can't enforce it. Even one cashier one. Meanwhile, 4 hours away Vegas, guy arrested entering casino mask. long there's gray areas, we're screwed. parks hospitals dojng excessive contact tracing. zero outbreaks associated theme park [Families Covid-19 'plan legal action Government' handling pandemic WTF??? point even going blame one person's ""specific related"" dumb ass comment. comment discussed reviewed enough people can't use excuse anymore.

This stupid. goes show bad education system failed people think might good idea. Really depends study, too. Anything hands-on like trade nightmare, lot majors school automatically passed spring. things called house arrest reason could switched to. already low security prison meant deemed risk. Plus people convicted far worse government related crimes either pardoned given house arrest country. hit nail head people following anyway. late. There's many stupid, stubborn people never admit wrong now. Maybe Trump come done April, late now. I'm Deep East Texas nearly entire state Mississippi like Deep East Texas. There's hope getting people communities like shit right already paid heavy toll. Take Stockholm death rate still 360 per million. even close making variance.

Edit: corrected math exclude population. epicenter deliberate government failure top down.

Turns failure money Republicans referring ""Trickle down"". Ink saying want either. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs fucking news story require medical attention, pay full cost. Depending exactly do, could talking thousands even tens thousands dollars single visit. According [this average cost emergency room visit US $5,036. include costs accrue placed ICU kept ventilator weeks time. [This describes COVID patient billed $34,927.43 treatment since uninsured. Yeah definitely lot maybes. It‚Äôs probably good news 0 way know sure time. Thus carry lock downs social distancing notice.  Rain?  


*chuckles* 
""That's **b g weather** wants think"" NYC still, far, worst place world. NYC country would 9th deaths. spread reproduction virus problem.

Well, no. spread virus at-risk populations. Like nursing homes, people diabetes hypertension. Something like half deaths Australia nursing homes. figures similar around globe.

Reducing number people unmanaged hypertension diabetes *will* reduce COVID-19 deaths. Totally fair point out. student still exposed 20 children teacher COVID day 1. people asymptomatically carry realize, crowds general problem. Even countries control, asymp infect 50 people 20 minutes. supply shortage impacts brands disinfectant wipes. manufacturers running 24x7 still can‚Äôt keep demand. expand production requires capital investment takes times implement won‚Äôt ever paid vaccine comes out. Throw ways disinfect readily scalable means business case health case make investment expand production. know source B12 works? need specific type pills? 

I've mixing Zipfizz, flavored powder supplement, water mornings quarantine say makes feel much better. like 41,000% daily recommended B12, well vitamins. 

So sure energy boost, placebo, B12 helping others COVID. deleted first response sorry, think ranty justified.

I think thing consider even people wanted stay home parents, normal circumstances, struggle. lot people forced time usual resources planning available. stuck home relief family, less means entertaining kids. Many trying WFH time obviously nuts.

This humans evolved live, evolve live severely isolated bubbles without adults children. surprise many struggle. trust gameshow host president wants rush kids back school get infected. vaccine around near future. Stay safe then. So, Yes first day school.  No, would probably test positive one day exposure, using current methodology. things world (not really, get point), arguable. got better help prison? mind, prisons US like hives Covid-19. lack ethics limited side perspective looks like horror movie scene. Fear shortage N95s one could get hold of. case cloth masks etc...it joke Fauci bombed biggest decision career. suggesting Trump tried actually fight pandemic telling americans stuff like wearing masks...

That might put masks trumps followers, maybe Biden democrats would also encouraged it, sudden noone fighting others masks...

Maybe infection rate would low person voting problem, Trump could hero country gotten 4 years..

But... is... programs like Blackboard Collaborate virtual whiteboard onscreen, write students write it. states, like Texas, made public employee strikes (and unions) illegal. appears organized walkout every single teacher permanently lose teaching certificate, meaning whole career over. risk it, wants move state teach, income healthcare, middle pandemic, teach another school crawling virus? current college football player, currently fall camp say 100% true. several examples ‚Äúscreening‚Äù covid joke. Also hiding test results making players quarantine shorter recommended time get back sooner .Pushing games forward play sooner. everywhere don‚Äôt hear it. I‚Äôve heard several friends schools much worse covered religious, always confused evolution challenged right/religious. God created world, can't create cool mechanism species adapt survive planet? That's good bargain compared US sure, McGill Ivy League school. Ivy League conference US. Yeah German military said trained dogs week likely already detection dogs. article says months. 

It sounds like safety take sweat samples thought infectious (compared saliva) place specialized containers prevent contact. 

A articles I‚Äôve seen saying need obtain thousands samples definitely sounds like limiting factor. 

Based experience, believe notion test 250 samples/people hour? think tire faster that?

How long would take train handlers themselves?

Is wide range breeds trained few? shit aint real youre fooled eating youre half retarded I'm certain, though doubt it.

With delays getting results many places, likely suspicious disease continued pursue testing. Texas get day results, takes like 15 minutes. Gwinnett human papillomavirus, *not* herpesvirus. common, may persist long time even lifetime, indeed cause cancers, actually nerves-hiding thing herpesviruses do. charter school worked opening next week even though district starting year distance learning. They‚Äôve tons money problems wouldn‚Äôt surprised reopening bring new students $$$$ quit told concerns shamed thinking health. Many parents rely school form childcare work. government support running I'm sure large percentage emergency funds options.

As much many (some?) parents would prefer keep kids home indefinitely might choice feeding housing family keeping home.

Also totally justifying helicopter parenting days let kids used going see choices pasted social media neglect social workers banging door. Damned do, damned don't.

Yes shitty parents there, like shitty people ages choices. also lot good people parents good options left. Oh right, course. Roughly 35 years old. No, even gone far enough look herd immunity even means. That's good point. wearing masks social distancing helped upstate NY keep numbers low, we're seeing upticks recently people become active (which, five months, expect - can't live caves forever). definitely herd immunity yet, never claimed were. cases continue increase mobility.

So also see increase NYC? argument probably see spike NYC burned there. fuck? 10 days? Scotland rolled test gets results one hour also differentiate cold, flu covid give accurate result each. Wtf going America? think anyone impression schools would spontaneously breed Covid. argument always schools high-risk environment *infection*, what's presented here. infected student came school put classmates teacher risk. addition, teacher students supposed quarantine, puts home removes environment school openers demanded children need. 

I'm surprised anyone even trying quibble this. virus, highly contagious, schools breeding ground disease good day. child may past coronavirus classmates.

Although US seems way behind giving test results people. metro Atlanta, county population 200k. Hell no. 

Source: live South Korea control. 300 deaths. South Korea 1/5th population, like 1500 deaths, 1000 deaths day.

Oh wait, 300 deaths TOTAL. every 2 days deaths per million South Korea year. Oh absolutely. mean imply spread possible likely. course is, course happen, regardless particular kid another random kid currently news story them. I'm saying title article intentionally leading. Compare two:

""Student tests positive coronavirus attending school""

""Student's coronavirus test result comes back positive day he/she attended first day school""

Or something like that. Without reading article (which people don't), headline paints different story, even technically correct sentences incident. actual headline used article somewhere two, I'd say leans much closer first example. makes reader assume he/she caught school can't case. say newsworthy, could stand less clickbaity it. Absolutely shocking, could predicted that? wild world. sure point trying make, I've already conceded fact propel life via connections fancy name degree. school trying open going close anyone school tests positive someone house test positive. School district staying hopeful, teachers saying side they‚Äôd shocked make end month without closing  Nose mask like wearing underwear dick out. test probably taken school reasons.

it could've conscientious parent trying make sure child contagious head school. Maybe they'd exposed someone it. since takes 10 days results (sometimes longer), probably ran time. kid (and maybe family too?) asymptomatic, probably figured relatively safe. 

It's pretty fine line walk...after all, even feeling well, could sick right know it. really hard live life thinking sick even feel well. 

Wear mask hope best. Kids masked school...and long them, need limit time school. cleaned HHS controlled Trump. significant drop switching. state's reporting note trying get clarification bc numbers they're getting seem wrong... also week non-reporting make harder say definitively.

The hospitals send data ¬†U.S. Department Health Human Services (HHS) sends back state hospital associations report public. one visibility anymore numbers HHS way them. data scientist almost vomited saw happening. Dominoes falling permanent record?! think answer parent would 'go fuck yourselves' Based special information seem have?

What legal document going use source? cherry pick make seem like case strong? I'm curious. Deaths cases decreasing! Praise Jesus!

/s already finished Spain, Germany Japan rising again.

Or saying Sweden reached herd immunity level? think claimed anyone. Antigen tests* rapid tests. finds positive, positive. finds negative, may still positive still need pcr test.

Vs PCR tests. accurate tests take 4 hours do.

Vs antibody tests. test you‚Äôve already virus. control, controlling. whole facade ""everything normal now"" ploy November elections. American stands knife's dedge. Stray little, fail, ruin all. Yet hope remains Company true. processed 30,000 tests compared 50,000 days last week, 5400 new case number pretty much line low 10,000s reported 50k+ tests. Percent positive staying too. really improvement, things same. There‚Äôs legal precedent, enforcement mechanism kind lockdown would achieve desired results 2 months United States... know us close sanitize reopen. likely happening here. Hospitalizions trending percent positive 10.89 percent...again, sure reliable numbers are, especially hurricane caused data delays/testing site closures.

I wish best Florida, would hate Florida somehow scathed without even bothering lockdown/nor issue state wide mask mandate.

It would give major credence alot state governors necessarily lockdown econemy, make masks mandatory order numbers trend downward.... heard man: ""It is"". link this? Curious data says many kids California actually tested positive Covid. wife interviewed local news, we‚Äôre keeping kids home (despite us working) risk isn‚Äôt worth us, we‚Äôve got immunocompromised child. said ‚Äúit feels like science experiment, plan send kids school see happens‚Äù Serious question. families 2 working parents classes go online? Previously relied school care child day. someone quit job? Hire babysitter money previously weren‚Äôt spending? 

I‚Äôm advocating return schools. genuinely curious. 

(Summer camps thing past different)  I'd like think since state level data reported FLDOH federal agency really something it. 

Then again, Florida's history Covid data transparent trouble free. I'm sure believe they'd make numbers, believe might get creative definitions ways include/exclude data points manipulate path some. pull apart cell membrane soap soap use electrostatic cleaning. testing show electrostatic cleaning works this, virus. certainly don‚Äôt last 30 days claimed.

It silly deleflectionary comment PR person. That's inference, might mistaken. Note, I'm blaming article. thing bugs this, husband positive wife negative share body fluids. need context, husband got virus wife get it. time constraint. type test stuff. I've seen personal experience one spouse gets virus neg tests results. Way often transmissible virus. powerless here, absolutely give fuck. already quit job wanted train 200 people one room. can‚Äôt quit university even though also making us come back, unless want cut ties future may have. Hopefully survive see future. things know virus indicate worst spreading event imaginable. orgy would probably spread less Rona. saw article too, flu spreads fast amongst kids school, bring home parents, insist good chunk schools person, flu could still pretty widespread year (maybe less previous years, still insignificant). Sure that's average. means plenty places (the US huge) drastically lower wait times others much higher. Right? last test took 2 full weeks. Read Wikipedia it. 30% (!) social contacts including work according Tegnell, jail time larger congregations, people allowed travel far homes months, life/death triage nursing homes seem key factors me. Agreed rethinking society's view masks needed, particularly fall/winter. caveat needs done sustainable way possible; beautiful, uncrowded beach Mass weeks ago watched wave deposited used surgical mask feet :( Probably likely connected strong people tend automatically assist weaker people everyday tasks continued virus broke out. cultures trying harder protect women children disease others. kinda similar small pox eradicated injecting cow pox people. Sort of. boggles mind. can't explain way. said it‚Äôs okay admit didn‚Äôt info. seem intent arguing sake arguing actually learning anything. Get rest drink water, may help feel better. agree. charge behavior. people reckless regardless prevailing attitudes, hence Darwin awards. 

Trump could supported mask wearing modeled behavior. could accepted testing kits USA production sufficient. could focused increasing testing capacity. could even lie us say he's looking this. saying ""It is,"" he's washed hands whole thing. live Alberta love everything except politics. politics becoming increasingly American point expat getting frightened. want move, want stay place backwards every step forward like mini war. there, done that. want again. virus seem travel best mitigation closed space Active HVAC unit(ie office warehouse) Texas, Company required employee get tested mass went ER get 15min results test.  He's lucky. 800,000 kids year go missing US alone. Total joke. I‚Äôm Bermuda; test results almost instantaneous. apologized backlog developing four-day holiday weekend taking five hours.

America mess comes testing. sure delayed test result helps smooth curve ‚Äúthey need arrested publicly shamed rest lives‚Äù.


You what‚Äôs wrong internet decide people saying without actually acknowledging conversation. course kids need taught responsibility. got mine back 15 days possibly exposed. Yes read correctly. test results came back almost full 24 hours 14 day period virus issue. ever seen bash virtual learning defend reopening schools dislike virtual learning.  tiresome tone deaf shows completely touch reality teachers are.  Nothing anyone suggesting keep children safe cause nearly much harm things teachers fear mongering about. Yep. I‚Äôm EMS- know well dumb people be. latest fall fashion include hazmat suit. Ah. Automod censors mention political parties? Anyway, sad automod censors provable truths. know kid spreading? It‚Äôs likely kid asymptomatic didn‚Äôt infect single person. It‚Äôs irresponsible assume kid infected someone school. doctor Israel theorizes coronavirus cured Jenner vaccine method - validity this? I'm pissed school well. (I'm trade school become medical assistant). feel prepared, zoom classes completely inadequate; supposed leave classes next month go externship I've done maybe half procedures supposed know heart now, half done all? school, meeting workplace, said bracing 15 cases intend remain open. 16,000 people campus.... Wow, great idea! Saying ""united"" like even perfect union!  considered violation contract, immediately terminates invalidates credentials. revoked credentials, never work state again, order work different state either go alternate route Master's degree program get entirely new undergraduate degree state choosing, assuming care credentials revoked another state (most states care).

So, striking state like Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas would necessitate change career. listen Pediatricians instead pretending expert online? certificated tutors

I'm asking ""people"" Reddit stop spreading fake news. I'm asking you.

And know care think schools reopening, like pass ideological test yours.

I think idea reopening schools right ridiculous. also kids school work school I'm sure opinion topic really matters. lot evidence shows random luck. Part reason Italy hard-hit due one pre-symptomatic superspreader. area 0 cases till one idiot decided party. Victoria got unlucky superspreaders corona races.  call J&amp;J random biotech company. 


According article J&amp;J's vaccine finishing stage 2, depending results starting stage 3 September. J&amp;J's vaccine passes stage 3 want able give many people possible soon possible. US like countries already agreeing purchase large quantities stockpile waiting results (since J&amp;J can't change vaccine mid-trial, produce now). hate say it, expect cops stand identify issues amongst ranks integrity.....

Why would expect teachers to? 

They unions, tenure, retirements pensions. took test spend 10x much 10x shittier product offered federal contract bunch criminals. 


American waste finest, take America, give greedy corrupt. think going enough sick pilots co-staff available given time operate planes, sick can't job? long flight, guarantee condition worsen mid-flight? OH NO! ODDS?!?!? RemindMe! 1 month ""I take responsibility all"" Exactly. uncounted reality still there. stupid paper tally sheet shows less numbers crap big Tangerine saying less testing equaling less cases. Idiots Ever notice state/country gets 15k-20k cases per million, new cases per day plateaus? matter state/country deals virus, seems natural stopping point.

Notice state/countries never got point starting new flare ups? predict fewer flu deaths since increased social distancing people religiously washing hands? anecdotally often forget wash hands eat example, last months feel like i‚Äôve washing hands nonstop People gotten multiple times. 

No haven't. Every one reports person never got antibody test confirm positive false positive due contaminated sample.

So much hysteria ignorance surrounding virus put people know nothing science yet keep screaming SCIENCE! do. Got test results less 24 hours. Thank competent county health department! Political parties scared put people huge arena..

Yet let kids cram tiny, windowless, hallways.

I think there's word describe beyond fucking stupid is. idea kind distancing joke. kids crammed classrooms like sardines; even half capacity, there's space keep anywhere close six feet apart. 

Hallways narrow kids constantly shouting, singing, hugging, coughing, wiping snot everything, can't even keep track shoes let alone ill-fitting mask. 

Mitigation measures going much effect among elementary school kids. Kids going home parents older relatives, spread community. But, but, already paid vacation fuck everyone else around me. addressed answer here: You‚Äôve solved riddle! Right? wrong think throwing match barrel gasoline actually *that* bad? confirm online delivered coursework inferior. source: delivered coursework online panic school shut down

this situation sucks. course person classes superior. Many people learn online, many us hate it. really hate teaching online. 

But prediction?
The schools absolved responsibility courts. shutdown conditions came state little time prepare switch. None faculty teaching experience teaching online. schools liable keeping students outside classrooms global pandemic.

Surveys show Americans support dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Surveys show Americans support elected officials upholding oaths office.

Surveys show Americans enjoy feeling like country exceptional instead feeling like country third-world nation. Wow, they‚Äôve set bar high. Oh wait....hurricane closed testing. Masks work exhale aerosol. exhale virus rides microdroplets, aerosolizes droplets evaporate. Cloth masks intercept majority said droplets evaporate. remember seeing video guy someone aiming shotgun said ""what going shoot me?""

There many studies showing effectiveness clothes mask.

Australia currently winter urging everyone sniffle slightly sore throat get tested. drive-thru testing clinics waits four hours.

We even cold winters country. comparison. rightwing parties western europe reach around 10-20%. 2016 popular vote candidate party crazier AFD,FN,FP√ñ,etc. combined got 48%.

Even take fraud registration acount probably still 30%.

I live 1 5 1 3 even lunatic? Oh boy...

All countries mentioned destroy public education centuries. everyone suprised schooling everyboy properly huge impact key skills like reading sensibly, solving problems, political understanding, autodidactic, etc. realised now, sorry. reminds of: need learn mistakes. Said person never learns mistakes. masks don‚Äôt protect much

People say lot true. Granted make immune COVID put on, however greatly reduce amount viral particles breath affects bad infection would happened get one. wife longer working healthcare. worth it. expand that, welded alternate exists shut set check points main entrances. apartment complexes. mandatory shut could leave every 2 days 1 person per flat could so.

They shut major transit check pointed major highways restrict travel. Food deliveries set restricted bulk sales neighborhoods. food deliveries allowed restricted based severity outbreak area.

They hard lock major effects 58m moderate effects 233m more. restrictions travel rest china. 

These measures lasted 3 weeks eased slowly. 1 disabled person whose parents covid unable take care died. 

It seemed worked, based data neighboring countries infections chinese travellers extremely uncommon spread americans europeans common. Knew guy degree Theology Oxford. Double whammy holier-than-thou entitled attitude. looked nose Biomedical Science degree great height. 

He idiot. made movie called *Idiocracy*... legend zelda masks, like 4 normal black masks. GREAT idea get cool masks kids. can't wear funky masks work, that's damn shame! go often enough wear lot, totally right!!  know sure? deaths New York. What‚Äôs show? like saw Colbert [""Truthiness""](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness) ran it.  plenty 'proof' provided scientists funded tobacco companies claimed smoking safe duped public decades. proof talking anyway? Nope, already tried ""every place sets policy"" plan disaster. point I'd surprised there's state poorly seeing increase cases. kind national response overall numbers individual states continue lockdown cases increase, point national lockdown weeks exactly need can't half-assed like first one. Mark Twain, Adventures Huckleberry Finn 1884

inspired wear mask grins hides cheeks shades debt pay human torn bleeding hearts mouth myriad subtleties. Sorry, wrong answer. fact federal government completely inept led fool told people wear masks reason that. Glad could help.  really wish could. Well, yes. doesn‚Äôt seem anything it.

I‚Äôm still trying figure feds seem want infect many working families kids possible. south shitload dems... They're not. I'm South anti-intellectual feel directed many people know. absolutely true large amount anti-intellectualism South real problem. wash everything plain old castile soap water. super easy faster said before. High school bullies go away. mentality pissed smart kid remains there. ability ""try"" learn mistakes somehow makes better them.  remember Governor Cuomo asking assistance April. kept saying New York would send help states time came. truly happening, it‚Äôs beautiful. Tell spoof Another 25 points *Science* ‚ÄúThey dying, that's true. ha‚Äî is,‚Äù Trump replied. ‚ÄúBut mean everything can. control much control it. horrible plague beset us.‚Äù 15 cases 0 soon...

Gone Easter...

Inject bleach...

Take unproven pills... Maybe, trees, apologies lack testing resources borders criminal negligence part federal government.

Yes no.

It's shame, sure.

That said, large scale, automated, molecular-genetic diagnostic testing systems pretty small world.

Right now, every manufacturer business producing shipping systems fast can. Systems complex build, require great skill build, involve meticulous industrial processes quality assurance standardization.

You could offer literally amount money Roche Abbott right believe would speed one bit. They're pushing equipment fast can.

The US tragedy let spread get control badly need unprecedented level testing. level testing never seen world. take many months many years make kind testing available. honestly, manufacturers going scale high believe vaccine ship orders diagnostic machines get canceled. can't trust website font. Sadly, mistake; thinking thought process.

I wish saying joke, logic common sense seems rare commodity society nowadays. Denmark able reopen sorts things, schools, US can't. always insist sanitizing surgical instruments undergo surgery. long kids get it, sub first teacher gets it, kids get it, etc. want make sense, stop caring fellow citizens community members. Hahaha REAL question here. 

My friend waited 3 weeks result Arizona. Nonono - - **tagged** replied person! Apologies errant tag wont low #s august, unless meant 2021 :x us regular folk bottom hill mouths open. treat. got 21.

Taking g good care decreases likelihood getting guarantee. 100 percent give illusion things returning normal Trump GOP bootlickers. Schools never asked parent input. know right thing is. many shitty parents want kid house. many schools made virtual spring learning complete joke parents thisnudes nothing change. know call needs made, many chickenshit make it. Leaders lead example.  called virus hoax followers started calling hoax.  Trump said masks work refuses wear followers same.  fucking war criminal 160k died various inept plots get re-elected.

It‚Äôs fucking National delusion, simply incapable something it‚Äôs obviously correct thing do. America simply cannot process argument, ‚ÄúWe objectively best path everyone.‚Äù political media system built process attempts gain political economic advantage.

The GOP‚Äôs religious belief policy benefits non-rich people way evil doesn‚Äôt help. Fucking idiots think society decided hope best even though clear evidence places go well. Another absurd take you.

And it‚Äôs 100% incorrect. repeatedly dismissed dangers virus, tune hundreds thousands dead people.

You you, defense *him* joke. budget? pool unemployed teachers hire from? Hiring teachers isn‚Äôt option. Hiring substitute teachers might been, often subs retired teachers high risk dying infected. Learning home worked. wont didn‚Äôt. used masks example didn‚Äôt say difference.  Asymptomatic mean spreadable. Asymptomatic people still spread virus. cares much thing spreads, right. American exceptionalism best. get politically active make USA kind country want live in. option


if sit back get evil sacks shit running country, stealing money, killing you. also supposed treat non-COVID patients. problem was, non-COVID patients NYC peak everybody staying inside avoiding medical care costs. time opened temporary hospitals COVID patients, overflow problem largely resolved itself.

Not many people, die. that's it! like President said.

People die time anyway, right?

Stepping house exposes death every day, it?

At least that's compartmentalizing I've hearing politicians. absolutely reason believe kid super spreader. asymptomatic part irrelevant since he‚Äôs tested positive isolated.

And no, it‚Äôs pointless considering one kid he‚Äôs far contagious he‚Äôs symptomatic. sure don‚Äôt understand that. Maybe neither safe, maybe safe. wouldn‚Äôt surprised safe. don‚Äôt see many cases linked outdoor venues. NASCAR well.

But don‚Äôt double standard this. virus doesn‚Äôt care politics.

If plan shut classrooms children runny nose positive COVID tests **then fucking moron think could last two days without closing** *don't even open*.

So since decided open, *must* assume plan close runny noses. People stupid, they're simultaneously stupid think kids get sniffles also rational enough close schools stop spread disease. Nobody believes things. observational study required? IRB, see observational study helps determine ok move RCT? US much better hospital system people realize, good grasp treatment solid plan dealing surge. US one best hospital systems world. price insurance issue. mean point one particular action really matter controlling spread covid within USA? fuck wrong people I'm saying children can't get it, cannot deadly harmful them. saying article suggest died covid, thing explicitly states parents opinion died covid, doctor confirmed child dead. article say Covid died it.

That's I'm saying. It‚Äôs sniffles - get it... /s ""Kids immune.""

\~Donald Trump, traitor humanity. It‚Äôs always emergencies. People afraid medical bills might overlook things like getting checked hitting head, holding going ER it‚Äôs late.
It makes sick think financial stress adds physical pain, it‚Äôs poor people: pretty much everyone conscious finances, everyone thinks twice committing seeking care.
Ultimately leads poor quality life, thought might go bankrupt getting cancer condition requires extensive treatment always back mind.

The amount asymptomatic carriers means never enough testing unless literally entire population tested continuously.  fair... graph shows USA number one deaths per million, reality currently number 11th.

""Because devastating fake reality I'm smart."" problem private prisons **cost high level security** vs. **income employment inmates**. 

This makes low risk prisoners valuable high risk prisoners. 

Around 2006-2008, became apparent prison system (in states) filling people committed misdemeanours. 

They kept private prisons entire justice system dropped par; supply misdemeanour inmates. That's why. 

As mentioned elsewhere, elderly female danish official embezzled 18.621.000 dollars danish government fundings spent money stuff like property gifts adult children (like thoroughbred horses one daughters), sentenced **6¬Ω years** danish system. adult children, found aware illicit money sentenced 3¬Ω, 2¬Ω 1¬Ω years.

Saferia hand, sentenced **4 years** *planning* embezzlement scheme failing carry without getting caught. 

That **cost high security** vs. **employment inmates** does, punishes low end criminals disproportionate amount time. man infect 91 people service. cluster 91 people while.

Superspreading events exist, especially related singing. common cause clusters size dense social network.

Look video cluster simulation small social circles closest friends, relatives coworkers save ass. Sorry meant house parties get together someone ELI5 got results back fast? thought took week. Didn‚Äôt go back day half ago?  Yea disagree. see way many people 50 wearing mask themselves.

People congregating outside bars one thing hear many people family reunions houses outer boroughs stuff too... Really? literally slew popular posts recently talking sub alone. see that.

Oh, someone posted Reddit? must make true! Wrong. symptoms exposed trying constantly get tested refuse test without symptoms. lot friends. changed guidelines made impossible get tested without showing symptoms. That's hiding numbers significantly went down. Right amount melanin one's skin sure affects whole lot things, like racial discrimination, lack access higher education, poverty, things forced people decades shitty treatment. certainly big factor whether one gets corona. one Georgia that's rapid test, takes 15 minutes. Plot twist: kid already covid going school whole school We're still getting new cases popping party took place month ago. indoor gathering hundreds people. spread thousand self quarantine. schools crazy. 2 kids contact 11 12 people since march. That's 13 unique people. Come September they'll immediately lumped 60 kids/teachers that's 120 people. Numbers explode.  We're wait list online education.

Yet laptops lie cold useless insist everyone coming everyday reason. us work home two weeks early everything fine nooooo. Gota kill people. think people would top 700 person house party NJ last week... Sadly proven wrong. People selfish.

We're surviving gallows humor canned food. Trust us, hasnt funny awhile series train wrecks **need** happen. Shave head hope best Shave head hope best done making assumptions based *style rhetoric*. fitting neatly category based kinds words use.

Certain key words give people away. ""Runaway alarmism"" one them. us finding people transparent days. want people assume poorly informed, self-centered lack empathy, use weasel words justify bad behavior still believe efficient testing tracing aggressive quarantine could solve situation without measures.  2-3 years sounds optimistic, i'm worried could go 5 years. It‚Äôs clear deranged cultist saying symptom virus needing travel everywhere actually pass classes year get redshirts year chlorine kill virus 15-30 seconds. problem share lanes

That's sense get reading full article. There's still month left prepare, think given new cases result. number one draw cut-off success versus failure? anyone wants insist near zero cases, mitigate harm done hundred thousands kids cut school services? 
  
Either way, I'm looking forward slap fight ensue Cuomo de Blasio. ok, statistics made up. graphs way better. take test able grad school, said results 30ish minutes. No, people stupid this. prominently noticed directly affect many people now. Omg actually happened? frequency Taiwanese cases reported nations enforce testing, increasing.

A days ago Belgian Engineer, Thai worker, Japanese student tested positive outside Taiwan. 

They test came contact foreigners turn infected, explanation provided case itself. way months Well I‚Äôm type person profits murdering populace. I‚Äôm good one. üëç grave!

What's over/under infected Florida dumbass governor? point got school, parents awaiting test results sending potentially positive children school.  29 kids 14 died US. 142 died age 25.


So yeah full shit worry, schools open every country look same. thing pisses people high risk areas subjecting policies communities high risk.

We reliable quick(less 8 hours) testing place country. single school open in-person instruction do. reducing lives suffering per capita, percentages rankings...

No wonder fucking problem irks ever living fuck me!

When flew international May, everyone onboard brought anti-bacterial wipes. Everyone wiped bins, trays, armrests, little cushions, etc. Even nearly empty flight, trust anyone else wipe nook crannies, let alone obvious places. 

When flew international July, plane filled capacity. Everybody touching everything nobody gave shit wiping anything anymore. Doubt staff wipe every corner every seat anyways. Take upon wipe stuff down.  Yep, crazy me... first word problem able buy single use/disposable sanitation products. pile old washcloths bleach cloths, pair gloves, go two day wiping door knobs/entry items since wash hands religiously coming inside.   Ok, let's assume are, also take word planes sanitized flights. humans dumb animals face danger.

Do seriously think example taking coronavirus seriously? Chinatown dangerous part US anti-Chinese racism growing.

Furthermore, plenty examples Trump taking virus seriously long became serious here. virus won‚Äôt around long, least scale now. florida, texas could taken kinds precautions country like south korea did

What hell talking about?

South Korea controls borders. Texas, Florida, Arizona etc absolutely not. completely mercy areas mismanaging virus. Like say, NYC, spread every state. 

Basically every single plains state could avoided cases locking borders. soon exploded NYC, fate sealed. Many European countries actually quite lenient immigration laws (compared anglosphere countries) hold university degree. But, need know local language level. feel terrible young children feel send kids one watch them. wife teacher (administration) I'm lucky work home, 5yo going back anytime soon (two teachers school tested positive recently). child age could stay home themselves, there's way hell would send back.

Unfortunately, Harleys. delayed shutting cases high, recommendations. opened soon recommendations. 

The dating apps thing... said hookup - mind getting Covid that's somehow ""he said fine hookup"". said large gatherings bad idea (meaning yes protests good Covid transmission) allow put middle political word fight that's somehow ""he said protests fine"". 

Fauci perfect, think really screwed mask thing early on. also think played little early on. unqualified critiques though. Republicans really want scapegoat protect guy clearly idea going (based last couple interviews) common sense seems winning blaming Fauci. Seems like achieved herd immunity since people stopped dying despite nothing Fuck yeah, NYC!! Hopefully beloved Houston learn y‚Äôall. Ya personally want bring another life this...it really feels like there's suffering come. Anyone decent knowledge American history would argue ""again"" phrasing.

In entertainment industry, landlords would called ""scalpers"". Instead scalping tickets, scalp shelter ongoing basis. So, no, evidence. Kids test positive chickenpox flu time.

The correct formula 32,434/0.0026%= 12,474,615  Maybe I'm wrong, vaccine 50% effective confer Herd Immunity reducing R0 1? understanding infectious agent's R0 drops 1.0, disease starts die naturally. already head start, millions Americans (hopefully) natural immunity point.

[This seems saying exactly that. suspect large part Fauci sees 50% effective vaccine good news. sure does. Over? people never accepted happening all. I'm keeping schools closed requiring masks everywhere, others warned coming pass. half-assing efforts economic damage going worse poor disease, looking likely would better isolating vulnerable/elderly keeping everything else open. 

&amp;#x200B;

Places Covid exploded early seemingly become resilient significant spread. half-ass approach draws economic pain, easier hospitals healthcare workers, I've yet see study tries claim measures saved lives long run (though I'm sure has, may many). *cough* bullshit */cough* 2020 says, ‚Äúhold beer.‚Äù  Thanks, voices gives comfort. obviously love fianc√© don‚Äôt want leave him, don‚Äôt want compromise people love football. manlet wrote article? get. One parent said want kid go back school says kid expelled. sent back school?  thinks expulsion worse possible death?? would risk child's life?  we're governed idiots. expect? Yes! Georgia past this. Schools dumpster fires middle cess pool. schools aren‚Äôt opening safe area. opening middle shit storm worse closed May. Huh? what. ‚ÄúThat culture people learned others wears masks protect other. hey, fuck that, amiright?‚Äù stupid fucking reason wear damn mask! going do? Risk getting bunch sick kids? maybe lumped covid hospitalizations deaths... ü§î Imo it‚Äôs blaming victim much trying justify death. People convinced virus nbd masks stupid government overreaching say justify death like ‚Äúsee? it‚Äôs bad, mostly kills people underlying conditions.‚Äù It‚Äôs question American. It‚Äôs ~right~ type America. 

It's even that. following advice experts. mayor quoted tried that, governor prevented enforcing anything allowed virus spread uncontrolled. matter kind American ignore advice experts that's people Rio Grande City did. shitty governor (and absolutely blood hands), largely *choosing* lockdown wear masks even forced to. Bro, social distancing. Ive ""out"" 24/7 since thing kicked off. wear mask dont count masks protect me.

Stay away others, especially unmasked, nose maskers, even loud talkers laughers. avoid crowds. time activities avoid crowds.

Be prepared walk away anyone coughing getting face. dont Richard politely walk away. studies show takes several minutes close contact closed area get infected.

Its respiratory virus still obsessively wash hands use hand sanitizer.

Plan actions. Carry paper towels open doors dont touch face wash.

UV kills virus quickly, get outside day.

Im introverted gets come man, gotta get outside interact others.

Im 50's otherwise healthy case wondering.

I cant imagine staying STRICT lockdown long. friend extremely careful. wears hard plastic respirator goes supplies every weeks. talked trip Home Depot like raiding Normandy. mental state good. ready break contact cause becoming mental/unsocial wreck. Hes old friend though whatever, I'll accept it.

Another friend took opposite tack refused use common sense. got Covid April, hammered 3 weeks still coughs head off. Im sure worse said done, honestly.

Get outside day. Sonofabitch make even remote sense? He's public servant trying save us, let's threaten family I'm inconvenienced?? Yeah, like idea Jesus cure sick lordly magic. How's plan working out? Yes would lost Republicans votes, really important?? /s olcc fuck around seemed like states best workers' unions, happened??  old vulnerable people already dead suppose  kid bro. actually facts refute article, cute man?

No posting like do. all, people NYC best. People worked really hard, main cause drop enough fuel fire. said, Sweden next nothing generally reduce contact voluntarily, didn‚Äôt even close schools, death rate per capita half NYC‚Äôs they‚Äôve pretty much stopped deaths too. people NY tried hard, end result virus running course part. mean, numbers absolutely lie. I'm saying US well believe per capita deaths reported Iran (as example) anything close accurate bridge sell you. understand sentiment. think downvoted. meant point think political definition. discussion kept matter hand like said. Gov. DeathSentence.. watched Axios interview Trump.

The upsetting thing it, me, HONESTLY believes there's NOTHING else country fight virus. NOTHING. Duh? That's entire problem it? like somebody secretly agreed people paid little humanly possible. Prison employment seems like small aspect it. half agree you. definitely first line. Going wait see happens people.

Also, plan making available everyone once. going similar pneumonia vaccine. meet criteria, first. Healthy adults 70 preexisting conditions last get it.

Where differ is, hiding house. bills pay. date data leading cause death CDC has. better recent data would like know. CDC data influenza still preliminary 2017-2018 2018-2019. say COVID-19 would ranked 4th yesterday. Let's say person got vaccine clinical trial turned effective. Could later get effective vaccine thing? people won‚Äôt get vaccine even it‚Äôs 100% effective... Staying home less disruptive open-shut-open-shut. Parents could/should planning remote learning places high infection rates. One adult home, making learning groups sharing multiple families kids one adult. can't that! Yes. question ask want smug, stop spread? Plenty time smug election comes up. sorry I'm speaking parents all, I'm talking people power ability allow schools start.

Edit: changed wording, would nevet want claim parent love child. triple PhD Major Online University says differentish. rate, issue important it‚Äôs overblown partisan voices trying capitalize deaths deaths people political gain, regardless facts.

I recall Democrats calling nationwide mask mandate back March, either, think partisan London excess death rate 200% one point. That‚Äôs 4 times higher America nationally. 

That's really dishonest cherry pick, comparing city country. compare London, UK's biggest city, USA's biggest city. look great you‚Äôre American crisis, you‚Äôre actually very, lucky. people world luckier living East Asian country.

Canadians, Australians, Icelanders, Kiwis almost Europeans rolling eyes and/or flapping heads sentence.  stupidity disappear, states open now. Heh. I'm atheist too, that's irrelevant.

There none except for:

""Schools open, parents work, economy looks good! least November!"" 24 Apr 2020 - *CDC* recommends people wear *masks* public settings around people live household, especially social distancing measures difficult maintain. *Masks* may help prevent people COVID-19 spreading virus others.

Ik doesn‚Äôt sound like lot, make $10/hr loans took like $2000 title built sub!  It'd mean White House would admit *w-w-wr-wr-wr-wrong* something, take wind sails lot fervent supporters, spent months railing masks ""freedom, something!"" Completely agree love Houston, can't deny pretty rough around edges. experience. I'd argue exact opposite. endless lemmings ready good virtue signaling fest.

In case, Reddit actually quite diverse. Painting reddit highlights insanely flawed view world.

Give group identity politics. getting real old. We're individuals; end story. Lets roll! ""You can‚Äôt that. go cases... says someone there‚Äôs case, people live cases.‚Äù Seriously. several teacher friends, basically said thing. bunch kids going properly follow safety protocols, keep teacher safe, adults done piss poor job summer? shameful. feel terrible Dr. Fauci family. I'm upstate/central NY. They're wearing masks part, there's still alarming amount people ignoring recommendations altogether.

Honestly, area, primarily boomers trailer trash ignoring it. Everyone else seems two brain cells rub together. experiment over? Seems like sickness quarantine periods kids gonna end 10% actual class education. Cut bait? Quit time?

No, domino place noone learn anything... Exactly, 3 3 different schools. nightmare. Luckily mine starting remote. Let's pretend minute virus way deadly. 30% people catch die. true plague upon land. Massive death. 

Then let's pretend areas country concerned citizens looked other, wore masks, socially distanced drove case counts zero. parts country still believed hoax. Continued gather church, gathered mask protests, etc. area, citizens begin dying droves. 

Should people responsible areas permitted protect people irresponsible areas. even basic way? Hey you. Stop second. Whats temperature?

When change fatality number back 1%. change ethics overall situation one single bit. one IOTA. 

So. Go screw righteous freedom bullshit. lacks common sense. part country 30% people catch die treat seriously protect loved ones. changing number matter? shouldn't. Upon first read, thought saying prosecutors among list things paid for. We're also one fattest unhealthiest world. Surprise surprise pandemic unhealthy obese nation struggles. least 1/4 people city got infected, recovered, can‚Äôt infected spread far unknown length time. hard Sounds like spirit animal knew signed for. people DoE happened get covid. even tragic get die covid specifically unnecessarily return unsafe work environment pandemic. test scores whether safe?  Lmao, stupid stupid. 40k died Also doesn‚Äôt take days test show positive? Meaning kid would bit prior Sweden do: adults old people live villages/suburbs woods far other. Young people live cities get sick without harm. 

Strange thing Scandinavia is: there‚Äôs houses everywhere. Everytime think one living here, see house. People live far one another. he's toeing Dear Leader's line helping spread bullshit swallowed hook line sinker. That's why. *gasps Mississippi* It‚Äôs crying shame Herman Cain didn‚Äôt television. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd known covid danger would stayed home. Show guy manual said, way back March, reason everyone wearing one first responders medical personnel need urgently. also CDC's position: save hospitals. [In context, makes means ""masks work"" you, great, guess. pass others do?

Are really daft annoying Reddit? US failed state? Yes. fear India particular. many people. wife pregnant 1st grade teacher. able secure virtual 1st grade position doesn‚Äôt risk Covid miscarriage. School opens next week still required attend teacher meetings take place school.

We got word another 1st grade teacher meetings tested positive today. can‚Äôt test tomorrow, terrified losing baby. tried seven years success. 5 weeks pregnant.

I‚Äôm virtual charter school principal. offered advice free counsel every superintendent area effectively virtual school. single one take offer ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù. wish people would decide right kids families. nothing important. link recent IFR serology study Italy takes cell immunity account? haven‚Äôt read particular one yet would much like to. Thanks advance! waaaaay many people would move case like Canada handle, unless want bring country you....  Eh, Sweden bit outlier reasons, first let point death toll high shit job protecting elderly. That's tapered took measures protect them. country lot advantages too. 


1. population that's younger, per median age, rest Europe.
2. population actually listens heeds health advice government. 

3. Stockholm largest single occupancy rate world. 60% population live themselves, majority transmissions happen home. multigenerational housing problem countries had.
4. geographically isolated pretty much everyone travel bans extremely effective.

Still despite advantages, 6th world major countries deaths per capita. 


As far herd immunity goes, really know threshold is. seems cases deaths drop drastically masking social distancing take effect. cases spike restrictions released. (Like Arizona). know yet. Never change, Reddit. Black lives matter theory. obvious example racism appears, Reddit reacts like Drumph. lack love anyone still make choose money lives. 

What percent parents wanted kids go back school?

I know people do, even people take virus seriously. big assumption say dont love kids. Trump literally retweeted Fauci conspiracy. kid started feel bad Monday, parents took get tested. That's got positive diagnosis. take 10 days. Swedes still obeying social distancing rules ~~and wearing masks~~ He's talking next season. lot longer 3 months bubble full season.

Remember, NYC shutdown slowly state identify inflammatory response child. Thats told school board.

I literally get final results back 17 days, longer quarantined hoped best. test totally pointless extremely stressful. needed work knows boss would said first vs second.

Just shitshow.  yeah lmao true. need everyone stone faced right Burn school? /s That‚Äôs great personal measure (and concerns beginning 12 year teaching tomorrow) death thing I‚Äôm actually worried about.

Psh Saskatchewan took 3 days pro life birth Tokyo, Seoul, Dubai, Cairo etc fine. point NY bad job maxed potential dead, stopped deaths ran wood fire. Maybe dense city like NYC runs wood 1,200 deaths/million less dense place like Sweden runs around 700/million. terrible job, got things control herd resistance. people heard direct debit?

Back kicked March, church I‚Äôm involved noticed elderly people starting come. big drive signing people electronic giving. week later churches closed entirely. financially reasonably ok across period. (Edit: said, federal government paying staff‚Äôs salaries helped.) Yeah, sure would nice we'd started wearing kind mask back March. officials promoting that.  think need educate workers unions. Ya cause putting health line save people important sacrifice /s  Missouri, governor yet realized we've running wrong direction whole time. Remember everybody! Testing positive *not* horrific thing! death rate need concerned about, 2nd grader better chance struck lightning dying covid. It‚Äôs simple cold kids. big deal.

Edit: heeeere come downvotes lol. Look, know it‚Äôs super trendy terrified testing positive. Don‚Äôt give in! Listen science reasonable! Constitutional rights never considered absolute. limited compelling government interest. question courts whether pandemic constitutes compelling interest whether restrictions reasonable address interest, there's challenge. love biggest needle ever too. maybe god sadist neighbors pastor started going door door beginning quarantine. fires liberal hoax that‚Äôs trying tear Christianity apart. ask getting number?

Is confused? essentially thing. think count teacher's union organizes it? realize teachers rely unions negotiate working conditions?

And politics mask-wearing gotten ridiculous many seem believe masks protect people

That *is* for. Good grief.

How many districts shelling ICU-level PPE staff? None know.

Worst, comments overlook schools interconnected part community. Disease spread inevitable challenge schools open. community baseline low, that's probably fine. key control. Plenty U.S. communities barely R number 1, all. disease containment point view, hospitals much less concerning schools. 

When districts already fine-tuning social-distancing measures mandating mask-wearing

That nice theory. Many districts *not* going following measures, in-person instruction packed classrooms, poor building ventilation, students innately crave close peer interaction.

Those things concern teachers, should. concern everyone wants see COVID well-managed.

Lastly- minimizing extent teachers *do* want in-person instruction. know nothing free risk. want schools compliance best practices.

Doing distance learning last spring emotionally draining required huge, rather invisible time-and-energy commitment. suuuucked. celebrities made jokes bored organizing closets shelter-in-place, busting butts much ever.

During schools's virtual meetings, talked meal delivery, inequity, mental health outreach, name - *every time*. us also parents, many teachers age 25-50 care teach kids well classes. know problems involved school closure. 

It's helpful say ""do job"". implying teachers want to. mistaken. Anyone know NFL players lift squat sounds incredible. Quick, build wall southern border state keep undesirables. People South here, rapists, murderers, some, assume, good people. heard Trump. People can‚Äôt grasp it. Unless it‚Äôs local, like actual town, doesn‚Äôt seem real. Dumbass, blame task force comments anymore. Username check out.

All history this. purpose posting get hate, people real problems beyond politics.  actual fuck?????? hell getting death threats??? pathetic excuse people???? Dude literally risking life health working constantly getting information Coronavirus finding cure goddamn people cant even stand THAT??????? swear man Americans talk big talk act high mighty yall dont prove none turning actual selfless person embodies REAL spirit means American. Shame people!!! think votes really mean anything elections blinded. countries sold bought long time ago simply prize election highest bidding party. votes create illusion democracy fact corporate scheme. look ""legal justifications"" invoked winnings elections understand putrid whole situation is. Wow hopeful news. ü§ó would resigned public speach containing: tried save you, seem want die real bad get it. Go on, parties, dont wear masks! Why? virus hoax isnt it? Also sooo uncomfortable! Bad thing failing lung too. thats want? Dont you? get it. Get infected!

Or ridiculous shit like this. source? could wrong havent found otherwise know constantly hear NY government cant make mask laws often hear cant reversed know credibility source understanding situation well. I'm willing read anything says differently go away like things go away weirdness inherent states huge urban blue populations 3 4 areas competing small, numerous, rural red areas. See: Pennsylvania. Especially since parents past weeks. disagreement there. fucking fool also. sure pulled shit like before. going long time. many places allow return work negative test, even multiple negative tests.

At least called schedule one had, flat told self quarantine immediately time got test results would late. 8 days later got go back work.. nevermind know contract somehow week since test. whole process silly. That‚Äôs true relate lot. keep strict social distancing even friend group starts going gym indoor restaurants. Unfortunately, instead encouraging join them, they‚Äôve basically ghosted entirely - perhaps think I‚Äôm nuts strict distancing stuff. :) don‚Äôt really advice, others thing you‚Äôre doing. takes lot willpower keep even many people falling wayside going back normal life. What? We're 7-8 months in. threaten man death telling avoid death? Ahh, mythical pot end rainbow people willing able teach kids. take spring let assure you. cannot teach children. 

I‚Äôd like think I‚Äôm average intelligence....though knows?? takes special individual smart enough teach kids willing put BS. 

So sounds good paper go hire people. right mind would decide great year take teaching. basically human experiment. ISDN baby. Gave edge command conquer online microcosm yet come. vast majority meetings company done person. imports team represents dozen people company 10,000 employees. wasn‚Äôt need it. Conference calls emails ways communicated. I‚Äôm glad company finally sees value using Teams. lots people likely spread it. 100 quarantine. going well plan Rinse Repeat??? We're losing country (and good chunk states) run anti-science ""but economy"" dumbfucks ~40% people believe them. gonna get raptured up. death rate coronavirus state 2nd worst nation. honestly great news. can't wait able go back NY. 

I love city way Avoid large gatherings. Gets full flight. Huh? knows. Wake County closed beginning year, anout half students opted virtual option. lot may depend wealth, whether parents work, family around co-bubble childcare, whether virtual schooling option seems like well developed based existing programs thrown together week. inevitable. Someone going it, knows many people it. wish death person stole identity, ok sure. embezzled public funds stole identities. zero regard others trying destroy lives betterment own. 

Takes special kind entitlement believe get prison early attempting financially ruin people might get sick. 

We risk virus, special. criminal. Wow bad fauci lied saying maks dont work US based Alaska cruise line special ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù experience cruises. I‚Äôve read anyway. Yeah, Cooper kind rough spot. NC‚Äôs government red recent election, GOP legislature tried kinds shady tricks hold power. is. Don‚Äôt like country bumpkins American South think city problem. Density may increase R0, doesn‚Äôt change IFR. Embrace winter. helps little... ‚Äúnot wise enough behave like massive asshole‚Äù? Plus made decision includes presumed deaths. Florida not. Hence look excess deaths see many really died Florida pretends nothing bad happened. math quit vs. strike different every state-- different contracts, retirement plans, labor laws, etc. 

But yes, states willing waive credentialing requirements, they'll able find replacements....after all, lot desperate unemployed people right now. Coronavirus killed 28 every 100k people Nevada, killed 219 every 100k people NYC. Yay De Blasio/Cuomo friends, Mar Largo hired underage girls groomed masseuse. that's hinky all. airlines don‚Äôt unless there‚Äôs visible dirt sometimes even then. Quick sweep chair back pockets.

Blaming citizens large unproductive. failure state meet people's needs administration New York fire February? Calling hoax? Case closed. lose. ""But Tuesday, classroom temporarily closed deep cleaning teacher 20 students asked quarantine two weeks second grader tested positive.""

Then seriously, seriously, even reopen??? Assume happen often, constantly closing classrooms quarantining teachers. really makes sense. 3 months in, occasional open class classes closed anyway. dry herb vape changed life. totally agree everything you‚Äôve said. It‚Äôs 100% worth investment. Fewer tests mean system manipulated. really well known test comfortable people symptoms exposed feel need tested part. still know people gotten tested past couple weeks without symptoms data come number asymptomatic cases people feel like need get tested. Unfortunately pressured open order receive assistance funds. I‚Äôve heard argument ‚Äúwhy receive funds school don‚Äôt even plan open?‚Äù I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt plan remote learning whole year still need help preparing schools reopening top regular expenses teachers still pay teach students remotely securing additional laptops students don‚Äôt access devices learn home. anything, schools spending even money usual don‚Äôt understand they‚Äôre trying make seem like schools trying get one save money remote learning they‚Äôre trying save lives. Hi, question: suffer thrombosis, danger others without pathologies? ever heard fate worse death? got tested like two weeks ago took two days results repeatedly tried argue people, imagine virus made get really close people, would spread much better, people usually assume needs intelligence make decisions, however virus DNA/RNA still, say example virus causes symptom makes people sad, seeking comfort close ones would benefit spread therefore evolutionary pressure develop symptoms would exist. grocery store 15 year old son yesterday, masks shopping really paying attention anyone else. son helping grab groceries push cart. waiting check line son took mask itched lips rubbed face. looked dumbfounded. I‚Äôm nurse taught touch face touch mask he‚Äôs smart kid. kids kids even smart ones taught handle masks forget. Like said, kids problem. /s  I‚Äôm sure Georgia, city pediatric tests done rapid result ones know 15 minutes. surprising. many people watch parents die something like obesity, smoking, general lack health, repeat themselves?

Right countless people saying need take covid seriously chow burger sit couch whole day. Northern California, drive thru lines control natural immune system forget covid-19 couple months (i think reported) wont vaccine-induced immune response also forget? going need covid-19 shot every year forever? vast difference CFR pretty incredible April today. understand deaths lag testing better even remotely near NY/NJ numbers. Florida certainly got lucky get hit hard early. CFR, 8.5% NJ, 1.4% FL. needed $45 alcohol swab, $26 syringe, $43 needle, $85 fee put needle syringe $300 fee administer close actual cost majority Americans. This. much this. part save life! Here's two facts:

1.) buck must stop somewhere Covid.

2.) buck stop President, Congress, States, Governors, counties, school Boards, schools, businesses, parents need kids home go work buck cannot stop student parent (broadly).

Thus, we've unfortunately come simple fact buck must stop teachers letting virus rip.

If country's teachers refused non-remote work shamed teacher going school Scab could start sensible move towards containing virus none leaders community members willing take. went vote Bum Fuck Missouri. Literally everyone saw wore mask. honestly surprised. Makes wonder number anti-maskers exaggerated. pray home? many crazy people left world. come virus killing instead everyone else? Scumbag attacker! correct closer terminal stupidity also people handed participation trophies. Yep, city opening schools staggered plan starting Thursday week.

Classroom load half capacity school divided two teams. alternate teams weekly school home homework/distance learning. think also stresses preserving public trust health authorities critical authorities needlessly gamble away. biggest issue see parents work jobs can't done home can't leave young children home distance learning. see technological solution problem that's possible Tennessee lot abbot ID machines get results 15 minutes. Places like Nashville Memphis run pretty quickly week, live near you‚Äôre willing drive rural smaller urban areas like Clarksville, usually find place test you. course, there‚Äôs shortage tests take 3-5 days come back, people can‚Äôt wait long results. bro die line *flips reverses it* (at least BC) we're getting test results back 24 hours... 10 days like student Georgia. Makes contact tracing hell lot easier. almost never see people cough arm instead hands Dude I'm angry, I'm fact I'm calmly sitting work discussing toppings we're getting pizza we're ordering lunch. happened see comment thought, ""Wow would pretty decent, bad can't happen."" I'm trying attack plan, I'm mad plan (other mad work make something like possible past 6 months) planned making offhand comment reddit. abandoned leadership, truer words may never spoken. appreciate thought everything, however A. capability there, B. ain't nobody position power gonna listen plans us reddit users. apologies came aggressive, intention.

I‚Äôm signing kid online school state, supplement. I‚Äôll also working local parents support kids. may form homeschool co-op. make $500 week even out, less, I‚Äôm ‚Äúhighly-qualified‚Äù teacher three hours away degree administration. 

I think going awesome. Right... making people work sick totally shows staff much value them. Maybe. don‚Äôt lot data this. depends lot function antibodies, much reduce virus shedding, effectiveness types antiviral immune responses. multiple variables affecting transmission antibodies one.

TL;DR don‚Äôt know.

\-ALR u/bbatchelder r/FloridaCoronavirus posts hospitalization ""Hospitalizations primary diagnosis COVID"" ESS metric 7,599. decrease 198 patients time yesterday.  ICU available capacity 15.6%, decrease yesterday 31 ICU beds. Interestingly, pattern become apparent, Wednesdays Thursdays worst days ICUs.  Bay Area counties improved bit, sitting 7.4% ICU available capacity. Tampa General 2 ICU beds available 98 staffed.  pretty graphs:  

Link comment: put country pause month shut again... Former boss‚Äô (I longer report him) wife waiting test results, came work drove across city another site getting yelled boss sent home. actually caught months later solidified position it‚Äôs ‚Äúno worse flu young people don‚Äôt get sick.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm people huge mess people self-centered inconsiderate.  infected stay tf home people need get chromosomes checked surprised attended school area HS. guarantee locals believe something along line political hoax still.  lot sympathy things like parents work able kids home enough devices bandwidth kids supplies needed. complaints really resonate me. We're middle pandemic. going optimal we're going learn improve conditions. structured online school day enhance learning, parents worry new schedule rules, require daily attendance, result intense demands carry role many say qualified handle ‚Äî co-teacher.

Sorry, that's always job parent. trying understand kids learning least e-mail teachers questions. respond, go media complaints. think it‚Äôs good start, it‚Äôs enough,‚Äù Ruiz said schedule. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving children lot free time.‚Äù

I think asking much parents able handle kids free time. elementary grades, school day would begin 9 a.m. activity related social emotional learning. idea learning successful, schools first need address trauma associated COVID-19 loss social interaction personal development campus setting provides.

No, figure learning part first, get past pandemic we're among worst planet, worry increasing social interaction undoing bit harm that's unavoidable still don‚Äôt know exactly plan is, children‚Äôs teachers need first day school,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúMy kids school year start parents sitting dark waiting find what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù said Koreatown parent Kellyn Gonzalez.

Give bit break here. new territory political fight teachers able prepare everything perfectly planned. Bonds extra incentive show hearing. Obviously, incentives place well. I‚Äôm certainly expert trying curious got many votes lol This. People underestimate unintelligent people are. unintelligent mean ""unable produce complex thoughts"", need able order get stay home pandemics. 

Statistically speaking, least third Western population intellectually disabled (IQ 85) degree order produce average IQ 100 Western countries. 1/3rd conservative estimate. Let sink in. That's better. I'm saying saw personally (I housekeeping though). There's also fun gossipy book hotel industry talks shortcuts weird things like that. I'm trying remember name...it's least 10 years old. explain happens phase vaccine trials time taken phases? mean, surprised? Maybe stupid question but, kids school all? summer holiday right now? in-hospital tests anywhere 90min 6hr runtime depending severe patient is. We'll often run slower one instead long send one, discharging home ED send takes ever. One would think would drive desire get pitchforks. *‚Äùfucking up‚Äù* caused 4x many deaths next highest state. 

You giving pass Cuomo disgraceful. He‚Äôs disgrace office. thought sub ‚Äúeven one death many‚Äù. NuRsInG hOmEs

Way make light thousands dead elderly people NY nursing homes. Hypocritical. money Lebowski... tests virus - taps forehead... Mostly it‚Äôs Facebook (popular PI) local celebrities. always tell suspect packages source infections. I‚Äôm really skeptical figured it‚Äôs easy blame packages rather following safety protocols. try listen take seriously, respond specific points evidence supporting risk reduction measures know virus. also try educate people DON‚ÄôT know, still lot, better grapple uncertainty inherent responding public health crisis. doesn‚Äôt always work. Sometimes people invested idea willing accept evidence-based arguments. I‚Äôm open suggestions better communicating group.

\-ALR future. think lives inside orange spray painted Trump suit?  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people charge state county idiots. Also, live county state school 5 miles me. reason good vaccine herps virus lack guidance grants FDA. reason still disease flaring population. Big pharma knows many anti cancer drugs, vaccine varicella zoster virus. 32 9/11s counting. get ~2.7 million say 911 9/11s! assume variables include controlling shelter place orders 80%+ mask wearing adherence.

Or you‚Äôre full it. Sorry loss Visit /r/chicago thread laughs, chuds infest place modmin approval melting OP right here, people don‚Äôt intentionally get infected however monitored ADE issue would seeing throughout phase 3 vaccine trials, even Oxford considering challenge trials though would make issue ADE apparent (here link that) haven‚Äôt heard anything vaccine front runners Oxford vaccine quite Cansino vaccine, even published results also similar. Nope.  Sorry. really fucking care nonsense. None justifies putting children harms way. 1 infection lead thousands infections.  nearly 6 million infections 2 million past month alone bullshit like this.  People need stay fuck home children need kept home parents need find means watched work.  virus controllable long keep causing outbreaks.  know contain virus limit spread.  time actually fucking instead whining petty problems way comparable death suffering virus causing. thanks see plane fly overhead every day. like alive. I've learned recently professional environment. Even something stupid idea, dictator sometimes need let idea play *show* everyone stupid is. squawk want people listening trust you, there's much do.

Republican states issuing mask orders months decrying fascism freedoms. People braindead politicians bureaucrats demanding schools reopen, unfortunately need dozens outbreaks *show* people stupid idea is. did, German meat packing plant. Like keep trying come reasons would different I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs thing happened Still good reason. Especially know make pandemic worse affecting economic situations many people. watched fb video middle aged couple warning people COVID. casually mention going cruise March feeling sick cruise, got home went kids relatives (really?! trying spread thing?) went urgent care tested flu, it, felt worse, finally one decided get teeted COVID positive. Everyone comments going wise brave are. irritated, wise brave, went cruise March, knowing COVID happening. got sick decided send possibly infected kids stay relatives spread it, walked urgent care tested flu possibly infected people urgent care. would've used video warn people dumb crap did, mind, gloss talk sick felt. Also NY short ventilators, beds, general PPE, certain President extremely neglectful response. Specifically saying help governors nice him.

Nursing homes basically hospitals. no-brainer. Oh option refuse take people guess information hand, information allowed Cuomo even suggest sending patients over, (the information being, NYC massacred, help) everyone knew happen. bought Born Basic stuff Target like May, luckily still sitting unopened cabinet Oh tests performed, yikes. Lol, temporarily stock... believe cases students started school pending test tested positive. Thank much comment. important insight I‚Äôve struggled put words. 

Tuition derived education student receives course. reflects many resources salaries infrastructure costs needed deliver education. Sure, online learning may effective feels like raw deal somehow. sucks, lot stuff sucks right now. doesn‚Äôt mean costs delivering education changed - professors still need paid, buildings still need maintained cleaned, infrastructure needs updated maintained, etc. 

For instance, school library didn‚Äôt poof existence students there. still needs staffed maintained and, likely, used faculty, staff, grad students ability work remotely. view, tuition reflects investment keep institutions going that, eventually, everything return normal. many politicians saying stay open even kids get it. Yeah know know click would expect virus dangerous would spread. Like movie ""Pandemic"" recently ""Contagion"" way realistic. think back 2019 Someone could die flu family others would get sick die. 6 months one positive test means many people could die seems like bit strech. I'm honestly still waiting hordes dying people shown hospitals like happened china beginning year. never happened. videos (and ones latin america Iran) ones freaked believe mortal thing. much.  past week I‚Äôve major symptoms Covid, pretty much feel like borderline dying, get tested self-quarantine medication. still people know high school claiming covid gone it‚Äôs thing anymore.

I fucking hate people wish would experience anything close people wearing masks honestly probably even name state representatives, point lack common sense. anything, they're subject Fox News propaganda likely following politics closely enough aware whether senator wearing mask. system place pay people stay home control, actively demonized people get government help *even work*. often heard welfare queens pop babies like chickens lay eggs live sweet government handouts. (usually racist) bullshit, people getting SNAP benefits actually work, perception they're nothing lazy slags engrained people's brains they'd rather work pandemic take government handouts stay home. cousin mine mentality, tested positive. There's 800 people shift factory require masks. understand position. pretty much agree it.

That said government needs step provide assistance owners employees shut down.

And I‚Äôm conservative free market supporter core.

But force people shut livelihoods responsibility keep whole. Hurricane going East Coast, 30-40% less testing Arizona Florida, underreporting California....numbers great! true, they're available much less. There's portable kit one US epidemiologist shown tv 30 tests something like $700, he's pushing US govt send schools, care homes, etc. politicsbot sucks sub. Edited visibility:


LOL! Maybe late March/ early April. New York received zero help February March. Get timeline know administration thought New York deaths fine. Oh look that. Remind idiot said kids shown study get spread virus?

And add fact majority choosing wear masks all. Unbelievable... There‚Äôs COVID cases don‚Äôt report it, don‚Äôt get hopes Oh well. Sucks suck. look many excess pnemonia deaths year. quite staggering record...their little doubt Florida many covid deaths labeled ""pnemonia related"". school district put AC last year think temps rising year June.

hmmm wonder why? /s doubt many scabs cover spots. state they‚Äôre already looking substitute teachers... I'm productive simply stand crowded train 40 minutes work. **At time UN chief Antonio Guterres warns ""generational catastrophe"" schools around world kept closed pandemic, Swedish model demand:**

**- ended right pointed direction travel means avoid anxiety open again, says Professor Jonas F Ludvigsson.**

**According UN chief Antonio Guterres** , mid-July, 160 countries kept schools closed. affects billion students. time, estimated 40 million children lost stay preschool.

""We approaching generational catastrophe could waste unimaginably large human potential undermine decades development,"" Guterres said, [Reuters F Ludvigsson** , professor medical epidemiology Karolinska Institutet, gave lecture Tuesday link (World Health Organization) Unicef.

\- fact small proportion children became ill covid-19 helped keep schools open. Initially, children made one percent fell ill symptoms, although made significantly larger proportion population, says.

**The professor recalls** politicians authorities various decisions, vulnerable professions would entitled extra childcare canceled national exams, prepared closure primary school mid-February, various findings - children becoming less ill adults - weighed against.

\- Children school also meet many risk group. likely meet 80-year-old different environment, says.

**An important call** children symptoms go school.

\- Teachers good sending students home parents also taken greater responsibility keeping sick children home. ended right pointed direction travel means avoid anxiety reopen takes make decision, says Jonas F Ludvigsson.

**Last week** , called Florida Department Education, preparing open schools:

\- experience valid. unique schools open, despite relatively large number deaths population. School closures enchant children, must somewhere, states Jonas F Ludvigsson.

**An exception** took place Skellefte√•. teacher K√•geskolan died covid-19 since 18 76 staff tested positive. school closed two weeks.

\- Teachers infected teachers. Teachers sicker risk groups. dangerous taxi driver. young people seriously ill deaths among children, despite fact two million children go school kindergarten. countries, Finland, spread infection increased since schools opened, says.

**Jonas F Ludvigsson** decision close upper secondary schools:

\- thought going far. sharp limit infectiousness upper adolescence infecting high school student goes school instead going town? Getting school taking bus also done many students primary school, says.

Jonas F Ludvigsson believes distance education affect learning:

**- matter justice.** coached youth team football, understood difference great different high schools. strict teaching homework, others let students think abstract issues. also depends parents' resources overcrowding. **Not everyone wifi everyone study undisturbed home**, says. Look gaslighting hypocrite. Ironyyyyy right here. friend mine who‚Äôs restaurant manager told ‚Äúthey‚Äôre telling us wear masks I‚Äôm making workers wear them.‚Äù Like, stop waiting someone else tell right thing moral responsibility. Yes. Obviously. County. working great stock market, rich people power really care about. children mingle filthy lower classes, anyway. latest side effect talking mental disorders. Yes agree degree testing Florida exactly amazing either. certainly missing plenty cases. think comparing apples apples hospitalizations either though think really compare two. One area completely uncontrolled outbreak guidance wash hands much better understanding prevention treatment. Antibody testing FL around 14% meaning also missed enormous number cases. Even take 10% looking 1.5Mil missed cases FL. vacuum correct live vacuum. Herd immunity practically unachievable strain near future. might well talking hypothetical think goal defeating virus within next 5 years herd immunity. Relying herd immunity get us pandemic fantasy thinking practical. impractical dummy Yes, extremely eye-opening especially social media people actually know real life. people surprised others say am. also even live US, I'm Canada shocked many idiots know believe Q Anon crap surprise surprise also issue masks, science, guidelines government laying out. small percentage still shocking.

Imagine believing Q Anon see Trump speak every news channel 24 hours day. barely string together sentence stupid enough believe he's saving world? people buy crap? hope thought it, already development. Yes. school would refuse gift conditions maintain later. half milliong dollar lab sounds great realize cost keeping running. Oh really? thought could virus 2 weeks testing positive? fucking bullshit. ever happened thinking children?! Pretty screwed, irredeemably screwed. Federal leadership response pandemic abysmal good place. likely see least 300,000 deaths year rate going, could depending bad flu season is, increase burden health care system possible co-infected influenza SARS-CoV-2. really stem tide, need institute another stay home order nationwide NOW. optimistic happen, minimum need implement mandatory risk reduction measures, well close schools non-essential businesses (and provide substantial economic relief individuals business owners alike, previous stimulus package). yeah, screwed.

\-ALR I'm asshole bc think elderly people get essential health services. SMH la LA la LA la LA la LA la LA ELI5 destroys one's body almost nothing another. explain NYC? live huge house parties going indoor dining within entire state, last time heard 20% antibody positive throughout city almost 50% certain parts Brooklyn Bronx, also forget T-cells show antibody test, still know everything. .y boss Covid ending first week July, testing negative weeks says gets fatigued like hours sleep. gotta honest. idea trying say here. started stay home 10 so. survived, although idea ate lunch. Try this: this: google without active infection SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity specificity person clearly paranoid mess strange situation. don‚Äôt know answer they‚Äôre looking for. 

The solution? Stay parents house... thing, also cancelled yearly mamogram, hate to, worth right now. Oregon I‚Äôve gotten test results back less day. girlfriend got 4 hours. think it‚Äôs due wide variety tests companies cashing large discrepancy turnaround time. stopping handshakes okay me. people don‚Äôt know especially. work texting center Austin, TX. run RT-PCR tests house PCR machines. call results within hour aren‚Äôt busy. Confirmed cases without number tests done mean anything. never has. There's meaning behind ""omg Florida reported 15000 new cases"" reporting 5000 cases look number tests done situations. every helmet facemask. safe?!?!

/s  is. likely kid caught school hand? Monday 2 days ago actually look success asian European countries sending kids back aware fear mongering? mean tons republicans like this, dont give crap elderly anyone besides themselves. lied masks. Oh boy, bet they‚Äôre terrified .00005% chance dying young adults have..

The kids likely stoked get stay home another two weeks.. üôÑ Literally every event spun people watch Trump ""You either us us""

Republicans view anyone contradicts Trump enemy. both. 100% sure tried reach people Let guess.... ends ‚Äúich people‚Äù Yeah. districts started Monday, know started last week, rest start next couple weeks. 

I edit earlier statement. parent, perfect time go beach nobody else there. teenager, sucked girls there. True.  literally idea background that's OK.

I'm wasting time classism insecurity. nice day. Please shut fuck reason people target Brett Kavanough Mitch McConnell's families. receive test right school? another test right 1st day? results came back quick. Stop tool. 

""This account happen new coronavirus enters body, based general knowledge immune system reacts respiratory viruses. actually happens? Well ‚Ä¶¬†sigh¬†‚Ä¶ thing is, immune system complicated."" ever reason strike, safe, keeping safe, students safe, reason. safe. feel parents need care, children need support, in-person teaching possible yet. I'd even say responsibility strike leadership take seriously. see, thanks clarification could thought?  ""You test much .... read manuals, read books"" manuals, books?

  little math. number cases NYC double mid April. would suggest infection rate 40% so. factor 8 70% claim less factor 2. sorry english first language. thinking 100% sure. could belive people share comment without sarcastic stupid risk job loss incentive productive even higher. ""But less cases as.... asshole thousand kids died??? job asks 

""Are waiting test results?""

""Have come contact someone tested positive?""

""Have asked self quatarine""

So pretty good ..the issue something like story happens.


Group employees hang out. Go week beach. One employee calls stating covid symptoms going test. Okay can't work. Easy. 


But two asked ""have come contact someone tested positive"".


No ...not positive. someone tested. waiting test work ....

So let's say work next 10 days. first guy comes back positive...now can't work 4 days that's 14....it's bs Cool, cant wait government mandated organ damage. /s idea CDC tried advance somehow children infect parents seemed laughable face.

Here's quote [The Importance Reopening America‚Äôs Schools article updated July studies suggest COVID-19 transmission among children schools may low.¬† International studies assessed readily COVID-19 spreads schools also reveal low rates transmission community transmission low.¬† Based current data, rate infection among younger school children, students teachers, low, especially proper precautions followed.¬† also reports children primary source COVID-19 transmission among family consistent data virus antibody testing, suggesting children primary drivers COVID-19 spread schools studies conclusive, available evidence provides reason believe in-person schooling best interest students, particularly context appropriate mitigation measures similar implemented essential workplaces.

This article full talking points straight administration, seriously tried argue also reports children primary source COVID-19 transmission among family members.**

(Emphasis mine)

This absolutely bonkers batshit insanity. 

Let's look supporting citations claim CDC proffered.

And [Swedish meta-analysis searching medical experienced librarians Karolinska Institutet University Library, Stockholm, Sweden, performed systematic literature review MEDLINE EMBASE databases 11 May 2020 identify papers COVID‚Äê19 transmission children (Appendix used broad range search terms, transmission transmit\*, attack rate, infect\*, incidence prevalence, combined childhood age keywords words preschool, pupil kindergarten. search yielded 381 publications MEDLINE 381 publications EMBASE. Although numbers identical two databases, related different publications. Removing duplicates identified 508 scientific papers letters. titles abstracts screened, 40 publications read basically found much literature child-to-adult transmission.

So countries better responses (even case Swedish study, reviewing papers outside Sweden actually cite Australian study), transmission rates low community spread already control.

The administration trying use incredibly flimsy bullshit sell people fantasy children high viral loads come home somehow magically transmit parents. saw pretty good mask adoption Conway (idk counts ""city""), enforcement. handful assholes wearing masks grocery store puffing chests looking fight.

Yes, limited, retrospective evidence children MAY major source spread. couple studies cases draw preliminary potential conclusion question. Considering they're looking whether people actually diagnosed, I'm thinking likelihood infection also likelihood symptomatic enough get tested. 


Gender obviously going factor (men worse outcomes women). 


I wonder body mass factor, since we're seeing higher BMI leads worse outcomes. Maybe tall people normal BMI increased risk mass. I'd done same.

Real intelligence knowing know everything. Dr might know rebuild transmission mechanic might know damn thing blood pressure.

But mostly left thinks literally know everything. Zero chance wrong. so? literally picture taken today almost 100 people maybe 10 wearing masks. Since students probably translates families feel masks means we're looking good 300-500 person sample size. Perfectly good sample size determine many people wearing masks.

I'll ask this. better source masks worn majority people states? misinterpreted entirely also pasted entirely wrong thing reply. overlooked? Obviously early April know things know now. Also virus spread NYC early heavily populated area shot. look people died 50s smoking people start smoking now. needs happen people attended house party Beverly Hills California. LOL think police wear masks? based anecdotal evidence. homogeneous society intellectualism latitude. Plus different people different definitions ""south"". think need clarify point ""they watch Fox News"" countrymen live outside South.

We mean ""they watch Fox News news source."" literally mean ""they *only* watch Fox News."" Wake up, Fox Friends. Lunch break, Fox News. Get home work, Five Bret Baier. Finish eating dinner, Tucker/Hannity/Ingraham bed.

Just 10x denser population dying too, justified ignore science *nothing* try prevent it? Like wearing mask?

The fuck point?

At point, trying fucking hard understand bizarre ass perspective, im baffled astonished braindead shit.

Dont surprised enough good doctors that's jaded fucking mind next 10 years. People like caused it.

Edit: gotta love downvotes soft fools zero logical rebuttal discussion extremely hateful DM's. Zero logic, hate. facts, speculations. data, word mouth. There's literally zero logically deduced opinions. It‚Äôs impossible way massive world ending meteor hitting us isn‚Äôt impossible.

Literally NY governor said sent infected nursing homes. came chickenpox middle school day. got back, half class chickenpox. Intuition requires common sense. 

It's like highly trained mindset blind faith (authority figures). They're primed subjects Big Brother.  Well little 3 months 86 child deaths 44 states NYC (see table 2C link below) vs. 186 entire year flu. simply extrapolate 350+ deaths (not perfect extrapolation since states also states go 24 years age kind cancels out). Keep mind kids even school time. yeah, technically correct feel like ignorant situation extrapolating data full year ignoring fact kids school and/or agenda. rarely agree Marcus Hayes, agree this. find DISAPPOINTING(actually understatement) seeing news headlines headlines idiots wearing masks/social distancing got virus speaking **deep regrets** **plea others** still disobeying it.

However, 2016 election, happen. people US voted Hillary Clinton President, Electoral College voted Donald Trump.  knew? Probably reopen everything active cases pretty low compared states, idk :/
Let's hope get situation asap  There's lot scientific conversation important get kids back educational environment.

Absolutely nobody thinks opening schools almost zero precautions taken, way Georgia it, good sustainable idea. can‚Äôt speak either Madison MIT, took Comp Sci Algorithms courses DePaul Chicago, exactly prestigious school, literally used Princeton curriculum textbook. 
 
No one really cares pedigree programming. You‚Äôre going get grilled whether put MIT Western Michigan resume. Trump right along. fewer tests get fewer cases. /s Look, wasn‚Äôt NY nursing homes got hit hard. Almost every hotspot‚Äôs main source death them. entire country caught pants wasn‚Äôt protocol place case ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. hope we‚Äôre better prepared next time. could possibly go wrong. pro-life party cares votes evangelicals give support abortion. republican representatives probably care abortion directly affect likelihood getting reelected get mine 3 hours. 90 usd Well, ideally speaking should. Obviously happen. means situation sucks. Money. Pay $200 get day results everyone else did. even Philadelphia - got hardest hit 1918 FLU things - taking serious be..... reason travel via airports pretty much go family many months even years.

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks even would normally cause job aviation industry.  Lots projections storm hammering east coast Florida, trended eastward. still prepared, pretty much everything back running eastern part Florida. glad work Metro Nashville Public Schools...we‚Äôve known we‚Äôre going start year virtually now, gave us basically summer start getting ready learning tools we‚Äôd using. 

A lot surrounding, rural counties buried heads sand either pushing back start dates getting ready start without viable plans happens kids and/or staff start testing positive.

The reality schools close due virus. Everyone, especially kids need routine, better starting year virtually acclimating starting person scrambling switch over. It‚Äôs simple process.

Also, I‚Äôm tired hearing kids ‚Äúwant go back.‚Äù Kids also want eat 30 pounds candy never take bath. adults make decisions them. maybe different Canada

It's not. Things back normal exception masks mandatory indoor public spaces. honestly think Tam implying extreme levels physical distancing saw early pandemic continue years, everyone (except hard hit countries) already relaxed rules physical distancing, gathering limit sizes, etc. We'll probably go back everything back normal including concerts, festivals, sporting events, etc. except reduced numbers space attendance. Trump ""base"" think pandering base allow win re-election.. that's it. Yeah, I'm sure accurate is, state put report saying peak infections anyone got sent nursing homes. virus already spreading large force anything shut realized there. deaths could pin policy, all. everyone else quickly learned shut nursing homes. feel bad children suffer parents stupid. I'm sure term ""world leader."" like, person occupying position/role people used expect real world leader =/ This, precisely. I‚Äôve heard past 3 years damn economy still continues middle pandemic. fully want economy good shape, lives become less important? Businesses won‚Äôt succeed owners, employees, customers die. city work mandated masks 5 months. Imagine much better shape local businesses would much earlier. ""I it, must real"" virus dormant inside body. could potentially get shingles anytime life, risk goes age. people 65 get it. I've coworker 30's get it. classroom teacher quarantine 2 weeks. parents like ""Fuck, wanted kid hair couple hours day. right back home!"" Meanwhile EVERY KID LITTLE JIMMY PASSED HALLWAY BUS doesnt need quarantine. Absolutely boggle mind sending kids back school without vaccination plan seen good thing. seems virus, you‚Äôre itching run outside expose many people possible like fucking zombie. think IQ Kelvin  trolling. 

These actual numbers. I'm sorry refuse believe science. Yeah. 75% parents signed kids hybrid schooling (in person 2 days, remote 3 days) live. Probably parents want full time virtual time work child care enable it. experts America conflicting ideas China still struggling figure virus works! Imagine making comment like thread neurological side effects. Nah crazy q violent far right going him. point caught it. fact needlessly mass gathering people virus still active vaccine. Adam Silver President? sad side effect deploying weak vaccine discourage makers effective ones. ‚Ä¶something like that. Although already job sent UCL like people masters many ww1 vietnam war american casualties combined... youre un american muppet. never call patriot, dont care 160k youre fellow americans died. youre disgrace country. QUACK Yeah stupid people want blood smart people can't ignore forever point early vaccines guaranteed job, know point. say 100% effective - something acting like said pulled else needs happen end mandated social distancing?

A working vaccine widely available. obvious saying. Lockdowns WORK!! Judy Falkner touch eccentric. also weirdly attached Epic campus built. every big gathering next day it's... Two ppl tested positive person tested positive ECT. I'm finding odd test results coming back exactly day big gatherings. almost perfect, That‚Äôs happened live Houston 240 sick teachers/staff Gwinnett County schools, GA. ‚Äúbetter‚Äù meaningful way good news. Could random fluctuation. *It mild genocide...*  universal countrywide health care emergency Universal Basic Income combined actual police court enforced health protection legislation.

Add comprehensive science based sex education, nationwide mass transit initiatives budget proactive infrastructure repairs climate change. Especially since always claim best everything.  So... 185 countries got better us? mixed feelings. fewer getting vaccine means mine better chances getting it. However, large portion population avoids life want might get back normal. No, Americans get pass slim majority failed.

Our voter base apathetic.

Our political system shit facilitated this.

Our judicial system problematic fucked way.

Our law enforcement agencies corrupt complicit many ongoing problems.

These things happen slim majority fought hard failed.

These things happened Americans, day day, give shit, given shit decades, *decades*.

We wield dangerous violent military capabilities planet, exploit ruin others gain, we're going turn people forcibly suffer abject laziness, shrug say ""Well hey, bunch us tried?""

No, Americans failed themselves, country, world. fucking disgrace answer disgrace humility fixing it, ourselves, everyone planet want leader kind. Apparently there's kid Harlem high another Lakeside high Augusta?

 I've heard ""they're kinda wearing masks halls, take classrooms since teachers saying ""if feel safe take ok""..

Grr... Thank Georgia volunteering staff children experiment cause long lasting health effects. Much appreciated. Someone needs tell violent anarchists anti fascists lay them.

Would immune system recognize dead RNA strands provide immunity?


Second question time.

To Sars COV 2 seems similar feline coronovirus causes FIP. Funny enough sell bootleg treatments GS-441524 near identical remdesivar could use current FIP research apply SARS COV 2? awful irony Corona, Queens ~70% infected rate... Apparently she'll told publish. ""2.0 billion people assigned treatment group, 663 million control group.""

Lol

Also, chart testing per capita. Projection much? presume shepherds exactly? Believe not, people capable independent thought even though aren't. course stay home (or parents) suspect might it.

Still, sneezing mask way less bad sneezing without mask on. still think it‚Äôs hoax. feel like since many cases asymptomatic, logically speaking lot people get tested, right? actual case number better reflection many people getting tested, widespread actually is. schools reopening interstate travel still generally possible, definitely gonna get lot worse. worry lot dumbasses see news push reopening even faster, people try live lives precovid even faster. things get even worse Antibodies last, actually. best data came New York China, robust levels observed 3 months 6.5 months respectively.  earlier report antibodies fade based estimations models, actual follow-ups, media ran it. agree herd immunity problematic concept need keep precautions place due fading antibodies. likely couldnt infect everybody since cant jump new host spread dies host.. that's also 50% people spread alot less. 5 10 people could get spread it. whole lot factors determining whole lot factors. difficult know virus truly acts Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

The rapid test done facilities equipment get results minutes. hospital work complete rapid tests one every patient comes. never national strategy that's problem. reason happened U.S. every country individual states started following suit. never real country-wide shut down. people flying right would rather not

Evidence suggests otherwise greater breeding ground Covid schools. go... Shit, Light Brigade probably got better pay. 85% parents sending kids back school, means school reopening correct decision. parents kids think it‚Äôs worth risk. Risk serious illness virus age group isn‚Äôt high certainly manageable. Please, spread misinformation. measures Sweden took place March still force ( see list ). shut **primary pre-schools** secondary higher education went entirely remote younger ones told stay home even mild symptoms. parental paid sick leave Sweden ensures parents stay home take care sick kids without losing income jobs. recommendations Sweden means ""orders"" countries - recent polls show 80% people changed behavior follow recommendations plant keep following future. sort compliance get country citizens trust authorities authorities put responsibility citizens. possible done handful countries long time put harsh measures. policy made Sweden lighter planned long-running wear people's patience out. it, breakup US starts Kids unlikely die, bigger issues kids potentially could super spreaders. learning effect March nation watching?

So Arizona good test case, cases going back aren‚Äôt Florida July nyc February level, basic rules turn back down. someone tell we're even considering opening schools right now? Maybe testing slows down, mean virus going away. pushups. Sadly, right. nefarious stuff starts happening numbers, indeed see COVID ""disappear""  name ""Cansino"" literally means Canada China (its CEO Chinese Canadian worked Canada years), worry, Cansino develops vaccine, would available Canada China.  Imagine dumb you. Even so, consider child known infected school full children teachers, may exposed well. 2 weeks show least 3-4 days test result come back. propaganda again. see article list school start date student got tested pertinent information like that. get people blaming school riled imo.

Please legitimize nonsense. like schools (in u.s.) actually teach anymore. like programing nationalistic b.s.

We learned nazi Germany u.s. public education system 600 tribes federal government shoved aside expansion.  wonder get along land free. first test took 8 days come back. another clinic offered 24 hour turnaround fee. first test free. people get test results quickly?

The simple fact cherry-picking going here. media outlet already decided run article kids getting virus going back school, probably used ‚Äúevidence‚Äù could find.

In reality, child likely virus going back school. article tiptoes around fact. didn‚Äôt explicitly say child got virus going back school, said tested positive virus going back school.

As is, state's ranking education usually correlated place people actually want live, means states likely urban areas. 

Urban areas better spreading diseases simply people close proximity other.

For example, small town Mississippi one taking elevators, even wearing masks. 

But NJ use elevator, chance catching something far higher push buttons every day hundreds thousands people also push buttons. There's equivalent mostly rural areas. show stats compare men versus women transmission/testing muslim countries? Sorry. Wow states uniting? Imagine that, states, united.

Im American shitty health insurance get advice Dr. Oz Guess chosen ones.  going years, agree, feel like part result lack real journalism, substitution media real reporting. there's much vaccine story. taking corporate media's word science looked yourself, know utterly lacking science vaccine safety effectiveness. Corporate media tell though. biggest funders advertising tune billions dollars pharmaceutical companies, turn make billions dollars vaccines. fact, front end required law proper double blind placebo safety studies (the government supposedly supposed haven't, they're sued that). back end shielded liability vaccines, something totally unheard medical intervention. someone harmed vaccine, goes secret government court privy science presented there. 

I bet hear corporate media one main doctors secret court saw vaccines cause autism cases. bet corporate media tell Merck scientist looked safety studies company deciding vaccinate kids, decided vaccinate bet corporate media tell they're finding aluminum brains autistic children seniors Alzheimer's, vaccines contain aluminum, epidemic autism Alzheimer's. aluminum autistic could go on. 

Sharyl Attkisson good reporting get real science behind vaccines different perspective vaccines corporate media outlet tell you. corporate media tells vaccine flavor anti-intellectualism; looking accuracy media consuming. taking someone's else's word instead getting information yourself, science background, looking actual studies yourself. People need able hold two things once; vaccines great, may cause significant harm, especially considering last 40 years there's HUGE increase use vaccines, WAY beyond ever used then, vaccine doses children going 4 72, adults taking vaccine every year flu. high rate infection black communities isn‚Äôt systemic racism it‚Äôs anti-intellectualism. Got it. Thanks clarifying! consider interaction time versus say trip walmart I'm always happy hear questions opinions people outside USA. great reminder things consider normal abnormal. Love outside perspective.

I feel like Americans' ""freedom"" argument similar [Godwin's every argument eventually devolves comparison hitler Nazis. I'm argument, easy get government thing like saying violating constitutional rights. Ironically, majority people argue stated rights actually understand thing they're quoting. 

One example stores enforce mask policy, countless people refer medical privacy/disability laws nothing policy. Even worse, majority even disability considered policy think they're invoking. want say (religious/medical/constitutional) freedom.

In opinion, whole thing stinks hypocrisy. people complain rights violated problem federal agents, identification, arresting protestors without evidence wrongdoing. brings us back freedom speech constitutional rights: expect constitution protect me, must also advocate others protected laws, even they're something find deplorable.

January earliest Trump could office. School session 4 months. professor would get paid 4k per class, amount tuition one class brought semester $160,000 full enrollment always had. worried Trumpy's 'Move Election' bullshit. 

Media loves Controversy President. fair thats also thing UK son went pulled March. absolutely crushing infuriating. Ah.... Already. Great. almost bad fucking idea. Children test group. Wow. many parents would eligible leave fed law  Yeah Florida keep AC blasting school district. School board told us parents ‚Äúif like decision, move.‚Äù fuckers Cherokee county GA supposed trust children. Fuck assholes. Cool we'll fucking wait around November. 

We know vote. much good think done? voted last time... now, world laughs us watch countrymen commit atrocious acts stupidity? are. Numbers shouldn‚Äôt fucked with. agree distance learning priority rural areas option. Kids internet, limited internet spotty access. able teach children need let rhem come school. Everyone seems ready say schools stupid opening lot cases really alternative. agreeing opening here, want folks realize everyone consistent available internet online learning with. sister one Homeschooling doesn‚Äôt mean parents become teacher. enroll online classes get assigned virtual teachers work yourself. people get common cold flu. I'd feel like Twilight Zone episode day every day. anybody know fundraiser family? Life Coronacene sucks, get it. notion playing high school sports right incredibly stupid. time effort wasted conclusion 1st grader could predicted. Phoenix masks common, appears everyone wearing one public now.  public it, issue. Pluse, testing sites down. able test more, numbers would higher. guess see looks like next weeks, start testing. Yet still reports daily flight delayed turning around idiot won‚Äôt wear mask enclosed environment recycled oxygen. guarantee people refusing wear masks flights causing delays people flip flights delayed causes.   you‚Äôre saying yes? sheriff‚Äôs deputy although assume parent.

Our sheriff publicly stated enforce mask mandate believes ‚Äúlegal‚Äù. looking bash USA.

Please don‚Äôt spoil fun.

Americans ones taking seriously! Save click : hcq really hope explicitly explained cost job, learns wrong handled situation rather going infect people interviews. worry! There‚Äôs 140,000 deaths!

It's ~50 9/11's

It is. Numbers gradually going down, back normal soon! Good point dress code! Sure feels like double standard. schools require uniform, kids cannot say ""I refuse wear it.. personal choice."" thinking firemen uniforms. part safety. Imagine fire fighter saying, ""I wearing that- personal choice."" schools care learn maybe make masks part school dress code safety all. Grim maybe hardcore capitalist die this, finally get social democracy reforms through. will. can't declare Confidence kick people whenever want. either resign(if willing that, problem first place), get impeached removed(not applicable cases, dependent functioning government exist moment), *die,* stay office time election occurs voted out. means plausibly optimistic scenario means put shit another 5 months. Somehow.

Obama warned elections consequences. Well, are.  That‚Äôs brilliant! Like single use hand wipes deal BBQ, wiping face eyes. Love it!!! oh fucks sakes I'm tired school bullshit everyone knew dumb, glorious leader demanded go through. number 2.1 million roughly certainly appears fairly good estimate. Note state IMHE model accurately predicted total number deaths within 90% based model March. lives therapists matter? Yeah, like Holland. masks, schools open. Reasonable precautions account reality human needing education/social interaction vaccine years away. actively fought masks

This ... haunts me. 
I think still actively fighting mask mandates. Missouri maybe? even want look makes angry sad. always puzzled reddit thinks private prisons biggest problem US prison system house less 10% prison population. going point working home works great lot people, obviously everyone.

If ever another job required work home I'd puddle depression goo within two weeks. I'm sure would get better help outside prison. Like inmates America probably put Medicaid thanks lack income huge amount money owed government crime would alot difficulty paying back millions. 

As far know Medicaid pay healthcare federal prisoner. means prison healthcare would option. think status changes transfer house arrest. Someone please correct I'm wrong. hurt dog yelps NIghtclubs, theaters, concert venues, etc, remain closed since events 50 people allowed. Bars restaurants rarely seat 50 affected, however, restrictions distance tables customers must seated. Covids effect nervous system scares shit me. encephalitis lethargica pandemic came right wake Spanish flu pandemic scientists believe connection still know exactly how, since disappeared suddenly. like smaller much terrifying monster trailing behind buddy.

There Robin Williams movie effects encephalitis mere thought absolutely terrifying. People literally trapped bodies like concious statues. work lmfao like saying people using condoms likely get AIDS. 3.5 months far brain really swollen today. moved back Alabama Chattanooga. Everyone told Chattanooga way liberal woke Birmingham. untrue bullshit I‚Äôve ever heard. never glad leave city don‚Äôt understand hype Chattanooga all. effect postmodernism Tennessee, I'm notahick. However woman walked office today, wearing mask said, ""I know we're even this, even real pandemic"".

Jesus Christ. entire I40 corridor ok, except areas relative isolation. primarily economic issue. areas thriving vs areas stagnant decline, smart and/or ambitious young people leave greener pastures. argumentative entirely possible playboy bunny achieve Doctorate. Just...not *this* particular bunny. =( think misunderstood me. sad government forced teachers unions hand use covid leverage get deserving decades. agree also problem also worth discussing, responding salvager, seems imply teachers access opportunities private tutoring, invalidates notevenapro‚Äôs point, kind injustice happening somehow means teachers *are* able take advantage opportunities bad people. strongly oppose viewpoint wanted voice opposition. Every state Florida man problem, ones get ignore there's wait release arrest information states, Florida exception, hear more. Lol thread dude. see username sure what‚Äôs funny you. Also sure even understand metrics discussed. 

Your comment low effort doesn‚Äôt contribute discussion. barf.

wow, please make fun disordered eating? car crash four years ago haven‚Äôt able work since. put everything hold indefinitely, including fully-booked paid bucket-list trip Japan, lot travel plans. moment can‚Äôt travel myself, idea I‚Äôll able again.

That‚Äôs preamble explain makes blood fucking boil see entitled assholes complaining able go cruises go Disney world whatever. people think stuck home four months hard? You‚Äôre asshole. New York always helped everyone. Katrina. Puerto Rico. anything devastating. New York always someone place else help out. sad asshole. Yeah, chances everyone else get soon. Hopefully becoming less lethal time like heard recently. I‚Äôm call lies.  It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it? Like April never happened sub. aren‚Äôt seeing lower rates transmission amongst females Muslim counties definition always wearing ‚Äúmasks‚Äù sort burkah? can. Bad. This. Hatefulness name calling gets us trouble, gets us it. matter it‚Äôs directed it‚Äôs coming from. suppose pediatrician already board nursing 2.5 years, tell stop now. still first wave. **If** control within next month, second wave fall/winter bad could be.

However, know going happen. Kids dieing rates remotely high enough affect funding. Less 1:1000 maybe higher 1:10,000. something always got people worrying ""robots taking jobs"". act like critical work. Instead thinking critical work gets done. point, assuming implode, automation actually good thing...much like animals pulling plow was. seem dumb get point far. One rules sub high quality posts. argued posting title without information low quality. Equate works well much electronic lab account this? assuming infection rates stay steady instead increase exponential rate. That's us too. wife going home gonna poor. crazy saving mode since April started see writing wall. We'll fine, incredibly fortunate.  Yes please help launch Weaponized stupidity obvious consequence unmitigated willful ignorance AZ testing down, sure they're well target much lower two weeks ago. Florida closed testing sites storm, last days around half tests. huge protest Berlin, so, Ah yes, remove study 40% people applied unemployment still yet receive money Even California, great liberal bastion, tons MAGA flags get away major metro areas. drive get backpacking fishing. access resources opportunities available, people still choose path instead. Yea, that's [absolutely Rural Vermont, same. Actually boyfriend (a naturalized citizen Mexico) repeatedly harassed lovely capital city. waitresses refuse serve us laundry attendant deliberately slammed door face. finally went back California. state incredibly racist.

Edit: voracious precocious reader. middle school, kids would get face call worthless piece shit, avid reader. Anti intellectualism confined south. Florida many cases CA less population. Texas big outbreak.... Georgia big outbreak.... huge epiphany yesterday...

Universities obviously want students back campus name profit continued existence. knew much already. never could figure society freaking this! College basically dream scenario virus, perhaps even K-12 schools large one-time gatherings. 20-50,000 people cram dense spaces (some completely unavoidable) EVERY DAY YEAR. 

The reason society panicking 'academic elites' make rules crisis! many headlines seen saying things like ""yale prof says k-12 schools going back bad idea"" YET single word universities..... almost like people putting statements concerned employment university's existence! 

Oh, societally speaking, impact keeping 1st grader school year much significant keeping 18 year old college year. 

So, summary. Universities selfish, currently make rules. advocate density kind... shut down. caught fear mongering. numbers really good hopefully true kids die. Ayy

My idiot friends facebook keep date Whitmer home state Michigan. 

They really fucking hate evidence based approach policy absolute zero feds St Patrick‚Äôs day. New York *already* mega crisis needed hospital beds.

Fuck right wing hit job.

Edit: you. nursing home hit job I'm starting think 'be authentic self 'and 'live moment' advice hand young people helped prepare situations like pandemic. kids need stop listening adults refuse enter school. case, incredibly short sided, sad. ""storms coming Florida"" lol storms passed days ago. Try stay current please. reasonable solution full lockdown ... vaccine arrives, hope days it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy alternate facts ~~just good as~~BETTER science.‚Äù Lol wow really makes Iowa look bad  need stop framing issue kids dying = ok. 

What actual protocols kid school brings covid school? sure schools Middle high school 50% kids gym change rooms, used eating areas, bathrooms. Seems absolutely impossible shut someone contracts covid. law probabilities someone will. 14 day shut down. least? Seems like plan doomed fail Thank treating fear Like brother's marriage, I'll give day two. scratch asses spit work? Fart desks? Pick noses? yep markets always go back recession/depression, unless there's total meltdown civilizations. main focus long meet fair value.  Send hotdogs.  next scientific article quantifies risk long term complications first. Anecdotes people long term issues (i.e. 2-3 months, isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúlong term‚Äù) aren‚Äôt proof causes abnormal long term problems. 363 per 1 ml. Humans breathe 7 20 ml per hour. seriously, I'm usually pretty timid person would going ballistic NBA much smaller roster per team, require coaching staff head coach assistant, require huge fields play on, require full week recovery games. That's able create social bubble single city host games limited number teams still contention playoffs.

The NFL even started yet, still 32 team nearly 50 players per team, 17 week schedule including playoffs. would impossible keep players, coaches, support staff, families bubble extended period time. Idk then, told back 2017 discontinued bought them, must mistaken really meant gonna stock anymore personally due flammability. liquor store.  christians America bad people. say want intent, he's willfully ignorant hurting people. Lol ur spreading virus protesting reopening schools spread more?! Depends news watch whether actually intellectual thing do. 24 hour news networks might well watching cartoons porn. again, correct. Thanks! That's it. would rather be? NY? NJ? MA? 

All states way higher infection death rates. Lay group think it‚Äôs fucking up.  part üíØüíØüíØ Well thanks handling Corona, patient. guess got ""being patient"" going me.

On serious note I'm US looking serious anxiety. eyes republicans capitalists, opening schools really isn‚Äôt much educating children (although portray it) letting parents able free go work get economy back going. 

It‚Äôs almighty US dollar usual republican swine. 'if god takes me, takes me' types put money mouth stop looking crossing road... scary. got sick, main bread winner, get disability covers diddly. get scared dying job husband way single parent. also get worried get severe affects hurt lungs heart make lose job cant preform duties. wish family luck too, hope stay healthy sorry layoff. times scary, nervewrecking. Ignore troll New York's cases going down, Florida, Texas, California going runaway? Go click hotspots. south. unlike early days pandemic, simple say big cities hit hardest. per capita basis, many places cases small cities rural communities Midwest South.

So yes. idiots believe wearing masks blame. Science political issue them. left bad Hydroxychloroquine, beneficial early stage infection, Trump said word take prescribed doctors. bad anti-vax opinion. Anyways.

They much spread virus refuse wear masks harass do, flagrantly ever want communities hardest hit country actions. America laughing stock world. countries world worse developing eastern bloc countries. Canadian border better stay closed vaccinated. friggin embarrassing. yet, state still called ""hotspot""...for reason. people apparently want die. son's high school open. They're going alternate: 1 week school 1 home. Students option fully remote feel safe going school. Phase 1/2 proves safety, phase 3 proves efficacy. proven reasonably safe would move Phase 3. Long term safety Phase 4 monitoring mass distribution. bridge crew Costco. Send redshirts resort Walmart. comment said anything covid *because* virus, ""antibacterial only"" simply untrue South shows risk anti-intellectualism. know different college students shoe fits Well duh. Keep mind republicans care COVID killing hispanics blacks mainly love. also hate poor middle class people regardless skin color. answer sending checks families pay bills get virus control. $1200/month we‚Äôre thru nightmare it‚Äôs study doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct. article political shitflinging Wait second, trying imply people south ignorant hillbillies married sister wife's, inbreeding generations ignoring science? 

Well color shocked. South anti intellectualism. NY CA there's huge cities tighter population. factors contribute. willing openings virus control. Nothing control Florida. pretty sure would opening schools Florida majority states right now. Plenty reasonable nations opening schools (with caution) virus sense control. r/murderedbywords NYC got early first major US city deal it, really understood much anything covid. also highest population density city US people live almost entirely dependent public transportation go anywhere. CA still ton anti-intellectualism, less religious flavor south. CA comes either wealthy entitled white people lot hippie/essential oils/chinese medicine crowd flocks CA droves. yeah there‚Äôs overlap two groups well. exactly implying here? lot us America. loved America. want love America again. past four years, especially past six months, America disappointed thought possible. supposed better this, much better. They've also never spent time north apparently. exactly every small town PA/NY.  They're pretty terrible human standards, driving daughter sex gets pregnant, dooming death. Sometimes outright killing extra-alpha kits. Sons come home stinking meetkats sneaking get laid harassed bit, that's usually it. 

On hand, incredibly brave well, boldly facing venomous snakes. first season think, never mentioned poor little Shakespeare again.

So all, human drama non humans. spread deaths higher yankee states. 

Facts damned. feel hope, man. folks Atlanta... never understood dad, man advanced degrees mathematics, pro-fox news, anti-mask."
