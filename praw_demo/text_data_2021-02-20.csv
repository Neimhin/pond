0,2021-02-20," least among people know it, worst symptom second shot sore arm. think lot comments people leaving bad side effects well intentioned overstate chance they'll happen. insomnia, digestive issues social isolation probably rampant too. Agreed, US national response completely willfully bungled. disjointed responses states makes things even worse one state puts restrictive measures people cross border neighboring state restrictions cause even spread.  


But never understand vitriol wearing masks, hand washing, keeping respectful distance one another - simple thing would let many activities continue normally. Many people self-important make simple changes help others. Lol yea sure, Im moron. I'll wear label gladly getting rushed vaccine. is, recently heavily frowned upon saying openly here. favourite posts people coming absurd theories vitamin d, tb vaccines others explain low amount deaths Africa without admitting age. Yooo situation here. got covid back March gf roommates never contracted it. Crazy stuff Many going skiing holidays Sweden families. ski important, think actual skiing part safe (completely outdoors relatively easy keep distance).

I think risk public transport back (for taking car) restaurants (if open). Elderly people also disproportionately high chance hospitalized catch covid. time neighbors ever stayed home whole pandemic snowstorm. Unless actually told condition acute/severe, probably notice someone know clinically anxious depressed unless lived spent time them. someone outwardly despondent mean struggling internally. already fulfilling contracts.... stop spread stop hospitalizations too. agree. love god, shut whining. doubt anyone real life would want come near you, don‚Äôt worry. Correct theyre also overwhelming spreading ah, known biden came Delaware. ever seen human there? I've never. curfew comprising half day, already lockdown name. definition stupidity trying thing repeatedly expecting different results. mean DST? wake dark again. dread every year. people young healthy, though, personal risk covid extremely low. can‚Äôt say issue Canada, US school told can‚Äôt open windows violates safety procedures case active shooter. always able say this? pretty much undisputed scientifically. googled US 18+ population first result 209,128,094 would close enough 210M, however also said percentage 74.3. Considering US population 330 million, would mean adult population closer something like 245M 20 percent yet.
 
It close though. would 17% least one dose ever find comments regard disease vaccinate against.

The difference vaccinating disease (was?) active rampant society.

That's much difference scenario prophylactic vaccination. could know noob? Instructions unclear. Injected self Guinness says them. misinformation? thought Astrazenica work South africa varient.  summer, dude. Pretty sure both.  
Or precise develop health problems after. develop covid disease kind permanent complications like damage certain organ example. hate tell accurate.

The IMHE models attacked several institutions including University Iowa hilariously wrong projects states 90% thoughts efficiently kill myself, estimate pretty resilient comes matter (being aware competency-bias, course), scarcely imagine many people must permanently done now. ü§î Hang on, say Covid affects elderly extremely disproportionate way death sentence young people? kind competition misleading/heart attack inducing headline? really hope right! teach we‚Äôve back person while. state started vaccinating teachers yet, hopefully soon. avoid (and even importantly, avoid bringing high risk husband) little longer, maybe get shot. helpful think many covid deaths prevented vaccine dose.

Each dose given someone 70 prevents least 0.05 covid deaths (i.e., death rate people 70).

The number covid deaths prevented vaccine dose given someone estimated 0.0002 (i.e., death rate someone 50) plus average death rate times average number people someone 50 likely spread virus to. reproduction number covid 2.5 average death rate across demographics 0.005. So, average number deaths prevented vaccine given someone 50 about

0.002 + 2.5 * 0.005 = 0.0145. 

So, vaccine given someone 70 prevents 3.5 times many deaths vaccine dose given someone 50, even assume person 70 spread virus anyone. Women US raised extremely risk-adverse. Luckily seems like higher % women men plan getting vaccine good. vaccinated person spread virus? I'm vaccinated many diseases would imagine well. I've never worried spreading measles everyone around since i'm vaccinated. would imagine also never worried either, since i'm assuming also vaccinated. covid 19 vaccine particularly bad people vaccinated still catch spread it? placebo? Lmao pieces ""normalcy""? Vaccines like, end. Nothing vaccinations. know exact figures, take 3-6 weeks first dose full immunity? 

Also believe takes ~2 weeks infection symptoms, ~2 weeks symptoms hospitalization (for get hospitalized), another ~2 weeks hospital admittance death. 

So someone gets first shot today, would minimum 9-12 weeks death averted right? see dramatic drop starting around March/April hospitalization death rates since elderly targeted vaccines first? Fox News typical insane headlines completely distort someones comments. could vaccinate risk prevent deaths hospitalizations directly. antivaxx. used word exception said ""emergency use"". difference? matter, one reading anyway. Belgium kids sitting classrooms open windows since October. dress accordingly either school... Okay, say anything wether someone vaccinated transmit virus? 

This literally ""preventing infection"" means....... Kind opposite me. Interesting considering men theoretically higher risk. Yeah can‚Äôt make unless incapable making decisions family make decisions them. believe goes flu shot. someone transmit virus infected first place? 0f -18c Oh admitting US worse enforcing basic common sense like using masks staying indoors period time protect others? Although numbers directly article, don‚Äôt actually add 61.3 million, likely trailing data know mean. Thankfully, consensus different back then--vaccines still fantasy everyone predicted huge winter wave Meanwhile India.... shits normal. Really? mean, technically true, ever find comments regard disease vaccinate against. Hey, know measles vaccinations, still need socially distance wear masks case. Vaccinated polio? mean open restarants. Vaccinated mumps? Still group gatherings, yes, still wear masks shut everything down. There‚Äôs also interesting story comparing California Florida mentions open school debates. me, interesting thing differently various media outlets report essentially data. pro Florida others anti Florida. summary though, two states opposite controls try stop virus almost equal results. website looks like phone: Please don‚Äôt twist words. I'm incredibly sorry loss, I'm sorry deal troll here. banned. could fever 105 drop dead gun would still read 87 LOL. temperature checks dumbest fucking thing world news web sites God awful mobile, want open web browser reddit sign membership. people post article chat read 9/10 times, almost never don't. Reddit really better integration news outlets. Lmao get fucked even Serbia better Canada actually give shit securing vaccine people. Unlike Trudeau whos letting Canadians die order virtue signal many vaccines Canada bought. grateful even recipient Indian vaccine aid criticizing PM farmer protests. think it‚Äôs bad public trust general. Doctors public health experts need fully honest. ‚Äúsave people themselves‚Äù narrative whole ordeal frustrating say least. fully onboard following science, think public health officials need straightforward. ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù statements unhelpful. Saying ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù masks working, people building immunity vaccines preventing transmission (to name few) always half truths. always technically true evidence, knew one outcome much likely others. find statements intellectually dishonest. blows mind doctors come make statements turn around ask ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt public trust us?‚Äù fact believe china's offical statistics hilarious. 

Hahahahhahahahahha.

Oh way, china authoritarian state. tad easier enforce lockdowns either listen elze ""be reducated"". Where, china, literally welded people's doors shut keep lockdown. know Biden magician deflect weather snowstorm. don‚Äôt see how. I‚Äôve plenty classrooms windows unopenable windows article UK Nah. Wondering got 2 months from, indications UK Israel suggest there's need kind delay.

US: 28,702,557 cases

China: 89,824

Who's superspreader country? point, think rule scenario United States B117 variant fully overwhelms NPIs causes massive wave, like UK. got late relative mass vaccination program. 


If 10% prevalence appears 0.8 R(t), would imply B117 variant growing 1.15 R(t) US right now.  Even became 100% cases, would still take 8 weeks drive 1 current vaccination pace. Less increase pace March hope.  variant 100% yet, still needs half 8 weeks get full speed. 


There's room modeling small bump plateau mid-March early April B117 variant US, really anything that, quite possibly less. black white.

It kinda is. disproportionate number teachers white disproportionate number many essential workers people color. face masks

Face masks recommended public transport rush lockdown

By definitions ""lockdown"" true, like open like always either. example, public gatherings people closure restaurants

Restaurants many rules follow. Rules like party sizes limited 4 people, distance tables alcohol 20.00. Restaurants failing comply schools

This arguably false. Universities almost distance teaching almost year now. High schools (grades 10-12) either closed done mix distance on-site teaching. Grades 7-9 also occasionally closed worst-hit areas clusters found.

Even article correct *per se*, omitting information focusing thing Sweden *did not* vastly misleading.  fun news hope makes smile Ultimate goal yes

 officials willing accept one reduced deaths severe illness **start**

if lucky know yet. study needs peer review maybe replication higher number subjects sure

we want screw progress made far premature reduction easiest disease spread reduction masks distancing 

i want one find hard way study accurate someone care getting sick it. I'm extrovert agree, I'd rather see friends restaurant outdoors see people all. substitute large groups going crowded bars. weddings concerts would suspect comes 50s actually surviving severe covid 50s mostly die it. must forgoten country virus originates from, hint: china. 

The country eat weird ass animals disgusting things like wet markets. Teacher U.S. here. solution windows lock last year. also squirrels running around ceiling class. Teaching trailers fun.

For me, biggest concern fire, fewer exit options there's active shooter situation. one big window current classroom open, know want smash exit. record, aim corner window frame gives stiffness less likely flex bounce stuff it.

I‚Äôm getting whiplash going back forth username flair depends public opinion. enough people oppose lockdowns, permanent rolling lockdowns happen. seem heading toward majority opposed lockdown US, already.

Good luck you, friend! Right, never said staying inside got every answer. amount ridiculously varying info long covid whatnot possibly concerning wish could narrowed and/or corroborated. That's I'm saying. OK, let's take immunity conferred antibodies - well known general fact immunogy countless sources, including specifically Covid. Here's  counteracted somewhat increase supply Pfizer Moderna? Recent data suggests first shot provides good protection (90%+) 2 weeks. So, mom pretty safe 2 weeks first shot (almost safe would 2 shots). 

Not lot people caught virus gyms, risk activity. tell I'd shoes, I'd wait 1 2 weeks second shot go back gym, take good precautions there. seems like fairest course action based goals. Come dude. haven‚Äôt done widespread antibody testing. half asymptomatic would go get tested anything?

The antibody testing done revealed crazy high numbers. New York like 20x back April. true all. seeing strangely minimal side effects covid. shots. it? seen evidence covid manifests significantly differently based race ethnic origin, aside socio-economic reasons. read statement 2 months last group eligible, give people group time get it. wait 2 months everyone's vaccinated. Yassssssssssssss basegods reported before. I've read news stories people saying olive oil smells tastes gasoline foods taking unpleasant qualities fear-mongering. There's disconnect way science describes things, translated press, public reads it. Yeah mean happens. people running factory paperwork bureaucracy aren‚Äôt paid much begin rules keep everything going. Yeah, I‚Äôll take any. apps like CommonPass, nothing universal. Wait one case, sounds like possibly caught covid again? someone getting first shot week tomorrow, lets fucking gooooo temperature screenings apex security theatre. Even worse dudes apocalypse suits disinfecting planes city streets whatnot. totally pointless exercise waste everyone's time point. don‚Äôt want cycle start fall.

Yeah they're still around fall, kind expect states still point ""well guys y'know flu coming let's keep masks on!!!111"" may work degree, know well. well-being humanity, guy needs really media dystopian statements. I'm concerned 2 year old losing dad, one us become disabled/chronically ill, masks hurt him. ‚Äúby long shot‚Äù see source fact we've definitely vastly 28 million infections?

Or immunity conferred antibodies?

Or vast majority people infected immunity? 

Are saying sources one, two, statements? sadly, first dose. hope so, faith Illinois allow Chicago same. course California govenor said that

...Of course said there's 12000 moving parts. clearly oversight. Libel slander work differently UK European law, burden proof much higher payouts legal fees, get punitive damages like get US, basically pointless. feel like thread getting little pessimistic past couple days, thought Id' share positivity.

I live Chicago went downtown first time month. still pretty cold here, sunny seen lot things reopen recent weeks. tons people downtown, wearing masks, otherwise, felt like normal Saturday afternoon. Even public transport, felt like normal saturday afternoon. sun went down, walked around trendy yuppie neighborhood, heat outdoor indoor dining areas many restaurants packed. 

The media doom variants want, even big cities lot people done this. right way mean welding doors lying numbers initially infected, sure. read comments here?

Or Fauci change first name Simon part make news? work. already vaccinating SA variant vaccinating Covid. can't say vaccines Pfizer home run. corporate headquarters Israel. actual studies done UK US. testing product done Israel relation covid single synagogue. Taffix sold Israel since early July 2020 used prevention respiratory viral infections pre-dated testing Israeli community sitting top two positions infections Israel.

I trust health safety anyone one world spent entire life proving think best except him.

Also, u think someone wrong something doesn‚Äôt mean wrong related subject it‚Äôs really good argument opinion.

My partner wrong many parenting techniques, judged opinions based would miss moments brilliant parenting concepts have.

Being wrong 1 thing (in others opinion) doesn‚Äôt make wrong everything (in others opinion). covid change smell? covid back november lost sense smell taste. recovered could smell taste again. 

I dont use cologne much, used afterwards smelled weird almost rancid? Idk explain it. threw out. bought sensation. Stopped using thought BO smelled weird different. using arm deodorant smell spray. 

Just friends house, tried spray stuff thats totally different got rancid smell. ability smell good smelling things die covid? going crazy think doing? Playing peckers? variants render vaccines less effective. people seeing CDC June 2020 give shit leaders used vaccinations make people forget corruption charges instead calling virus fake! apparently imprisoning scientists invalidate country's belief scientific method. 

Yes does, fact deny proves authoritarian science-denier. need review scientific method?

Yes do, need review yourself. implying demonized authoritarian countries, believe testing hypotheses 

Because don't. point authoritarians inflict violence scientists end giving results threaten authoritarian regime. say like testing hypothesis, like ""testing hypothesis long make us look bad."" same.

To go back Christianity analogy, attempting argue ""Christianity except think Jesus Messiah"" Christianity. Absolute nonsense, not. completely different religion. Similarly, ""Scientific Method"" must always carry proviso way anger regime Scientific Method, something else Many feel recent 'cancel culture', americans longer 'freedom speech'. 

Yes, idiots think Therefore say current American culture 'anti-freedom speech'?

No, proves point. Anti-free speech would people (and particular, government) committing acts violence others simply views expressed. (Of course, happen, overwhelming numbers Americans think violence wrong). think [they already They're working time. think important vaccinate SA variant spreads Pfizer doesnt work we'll another pandemic.  guarantee hospitalizations get certain level revise tiers. Yellow insanely restrictive data. data since vaccines finished trials. You‚Äôre going make decisions eventually. also thank you. got really worried second vaccinated many covid declined 1%. reddit posts back demonizing trump attempts keep masks here. Damned do, damned dont. Israel tracking immunity dropping quickly Whilst good older generation trust thr government enough follow rules get vaccine, sadly also means stuck Conservative government long time yet. Whilst vaccine rollout successful thus far, pretty much every aspect handling Pandemic haphazard best downright ridiculous worst. Cheap Source protein plus help environment get live next election vote things help people younger them... moved back California Texas last summer hated Texas.

But God damnit California love done nothing bust balls entire time.

If actually keep security theater bullshit past March, I'm gonna start making plans Seattle Portland. I‚Äôm gonna put there. vape pod day coronavirus. know literal hundreds people like me. Don‚Äôt nobody give fuck devil can‚Äôt see. people called idiots. Plain simple. also opposite scenario:With at-risk group protected much harder advocate contact restrictions, arguments obvious. virus rip free infect much larger group younger people. problem? Even though younger people less risky get hospitalized dial numbers high enough still fill hospitals. also group pre existing condition aware it. really depends fast vaccinate. saying going happen chance will.

I think false positive rate high. example Australia last 7 days 430,000 tests 0.2% \[1\] come back positive. said low positivity rate likely higher degree care taken. example positive cases genome sequenced retests occur inconclusive results/viral shedding previous infections.

\[1\] know? know anything possible true anyone claim something impossible. u people change opinions wind without research themselves.  high school, junior high, think least music room elementary school windows interior (don't know makes sense, can't think another word it) classrooms, one exit. schools exterior rooms? curious. One two might really foggy skylight that's it. 2 4 weeks vaccination immunity kick in. rules lifted August. lot depend availability booster new varieties. mr happy feet.. are. Samen here. Household two, got sick, one tested positive. didn‚Äôt feel need get tested risk infecting people.

Undoubtedly shitton cases like this. Add asymptomatic ones get high number people antibodies. counting Palestinians course. Brit we're kind used slightly shoddy results. least seems better Chinese ones seem stop hospitalised. due respect, risk factors young people quite preventable. BMI 30 usually due poor diet exercise, percentage isn‚Äôt treatable medicine (mostly). Smokers lungs preventable smoking. weak heart strengthened cardio. 

Obviously none methods easy, otherwise everyone would done now. Well tell then. think virus originated? currently faced question severity infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may change years ahead. analysis immunological epidemiological data endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) shows infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly disease-reducing immunity long-lived. model, incorporating components immunity, recapitulates current severity SARS-CoV-2 infection benign nature HCoVs, suggesting endemic phase reached primary exposure childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may virulent common cold. predict different outcome emergent coronavirus causes severe disease children. results reinforce importance behavioral containment pandemic vaccine rollout, prompting us evaluate scenarios continuing vaccination endemic 1918 H1N1 pandemic never vaccine, herd immunity reached mutated came back every year seasonal influenza.

When virus mutates achieve immune escape reset clock back zero ""COVID-22"" whatever lethality people either recovered successfully COVID vaccinated level side effects due [original antigenic virus also eventually forced mutate ways increase transmission make less lethal. spike change much achieve immune escape ACE2 binding goes it'll become less virulent less transmissible. evidence? there's evidence, believe US government would happy tell everyone. least people found trace live virus food packages. see Israel. amount 65+ people hospitals dropped significantly amount 40+ actually access vaccinations decided (because ‚Äúyoung healthy‚Äù) going up. can‚Äôt understand despite blessed abundance vaccinations everybody 18 small amount took chance. Aren‚Äôt entitled bozos harp day long want go back normal party shit? Get fucking vaccinated within month golden. aunt one last survived polio infection country. super lucky, infection meant ‚Äúonly‚Äù hard round illness youth lifetime physical therapy. one family remotely anti vaccine.

Ok great, let‚Äôs move next age bracket! Likewise shocked haven‚Äôt scars vaccines Normality coming town. Gotta explain numbers somehow lol No.

The fact swung back around kinda weird honest, like looking poke holes think can, attempt shake confidence person trust ability delegate nothing left merit add. 

From sit, I‚Äôm far qualified decide move forward are, partly know people involved personal circle little better you, partly I‚Äôm trained work researcher, medical researcher, that‚Äôs different skill set, would know respect credible research skills yourself.

Either way, it‚Äôs far constructive tool moving conversation forward leads believe that‚Äôs goal anyway, clearly.

Further more, feel like I‚Äôm actually talking 12 yr old, least person maturity one ‚Äòcool story bro‚Äô seriously, strikingly immature.

I won‚Äôt discussing subject you, can‚Äôt take seriously now. 

If wondering exactly most, cool story bro, can‚Äôt shake level tact. belongs high school science lab, real world one. please repeat that!

Science used show literally anything. Proving something different simple XY graph. 

Also don‚Äôt dare challenge someone read science paper 90% scientists says vocabulary. Science changes based new information. Climate change big one people often think settled it‚Äôs not. pretty much every field. Even something basic Physics Quantum Mechanics comes along changes view everything works. Why? think so? think it‚Äôs likely frozen food honest Lol...I mean taken 2 months get around 2% population get shots, maybe even optimistic :/ Sure. thought looking every corner? lab theory also unlikely according scientists still checked no? UK close borders getting vaccination levels high enough single doses. wait rest world catch up.  said last week sub would‚Äôve downvoted oblivion. absolutely right though. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs unlikely covid outbreak started food imports. unlikely we've vaccinating since end December still super slow. We're around 2% entire population received shots, 2 months vaccination program. I'm feeling hopeless now, really hope right!  Makes sense, NY NJ 2nd wave peaked 2 weeks Christmas/New Years fallen half since then. It‚Äôs bit strange entire US getting herd immunity least strong level herd resistance time. Nurses took mine said (acetaminophen) like tylenol okay getting shot before. sure I've heard acetaminophen pain reliever use others I'd stick unless doctor nurse tells otherwise. ask sure well anyone could wrong. I'm personally avoiding anti-inflammatory pain relievers unless feeling really bad. Nah. entitled opinion comment suggest wanted die. 

When shit first started (a whole year ago almost!) people constantly saying ""two weeks"" often gleefully cheering bad death numbers places like Florida. predictable be. like said, saying ill-advised lot different - intent call out.

Ok reading effective vs sterilizing immunity vaccines -- former mitigating severe symptoms still transmissible (covid mild cold) latter complete immunity.

First off, since current vaccines classify effective immunity, meaning vaccinated people still contagious transmit virus, ever enough impact herd immunity, seeks lower R naught infectiousness?

We‚Äôre something like 500,000 PCR tests day. think Hancock said back false positives rates PCR 0.8%. means positive daily results go 4000 day regardless much Covid is. IMHO 10k daily infections, using infection numbers determine policy wrong way go. actually surprised events cancelled year. People still travel seeing lot ‚Äúhiding behind science‚Äù political discourse. lot people ok speculation fits confirmation bias, doesn‚Äôt start demanding double blinded randomized control trials. lack objectivity actually anti science really needs called out. Thank explaining :) 
Well virus vectors likely hang in, say get congregate. going go back normal quicker think. 'new normal'. Yessir  Wait, now? think go back normal 4.2% people could possibly get Covid post vaccine, even group 99% need hospitalized? die?

Seriously? bodies gonna pile streets real time?

Because TV people lied last time. Yah right tricky unions, trying what's right members, listen corporations Instead, they're friendly nice, certainly workers interest mind lol. Bend I'll show ya. Y‚Äôall really saw Trump Boris said ‚ÄúWe want too!‚Äù Lockdown doom cultists worst, anything hold onto moral superiority. Thanks! I've hugging family members whole time. shit Sherlock prob :) pleasure! course! Happy talk :) Actually plenty scientists saying first dose harsh prior covids. good news provides rather robust immunity. completely, lot closer now. ahhh! happy mom. You‚Äôre close hug ü§ó USA! USA! USA!

Jk, sorry y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt getting poked yet, hope happens guys soon‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è already covid, that's reason first dose harsher. happened dad, plenty reports case. Although, prior immunity + 1 shot = robust immunity (better 2 shots others, apparently) haven‚Äôt seen dad since September 2019. love dad. means world me. got 2nd vaccine shot, I‚Äôm relieved don‚Äôt worry much anymore. 

I‚Äôve careful, got coronavirus earlier month due rock hard place circumstances. health dept. said I‚Äôd immune 3 months infection. I‚Äôm going see dad soon I‚Äôm well enough walk without running breath. I‚Äôm going cry like baby see him. can‚Äôt wait give huge hug. still want vaccine, cause survived COVID, get live temporarily like I‚Äôve already it. 

I hope get vaccine soon. hope can. It‚Äôs hard deny basic humanity need connection long. 

With said, infected worth temporary immunity. Coronavirus scary shit would *anything* avoid ever infected again. Wouldn‚Äôt wish worst enemies. hope people get vaccinated avoid awful, painful virus suffering comes along it. babbling muh rights American patriot. I'm ashamed American, I'm embarrassed lumped idiots. ones debasing society.

Report reddit spam move on. Love vax isn‚Äôt available reminder people saying ‚Äúcovid nearly over‚Äù (or least supposed be) USA covid subreddit lot people sub (like me) aren‚Äôt American. 

Maybe lockdowns pandemic ending relatively soon guys Europe Canada I‚Äôm from, it‚Äôs shitty ever nobody‚Äôs vaccinated government incredibly na√Øve. Glad it‚Äôs ending soon sub really seems focus states nowhere else, global thing there‚Äôs really end sight Canada countries. Possible also opposite scenario:

With at-risk group protected much harder advocate contact restrictions, arguments obvious. virus rip free infect much larger group younger people. problem? Even though younger people less risky get hospitalized dial numbers high enough still fill hospitals. also group pre existing condition aware it. really depends fast vaccinate. saying going happen chance will. 25 years school. I‚Äôll take nothing less. life resumes, suppose none decline allowed e.g. travel without masks, etc. Two years? Five? long kids stay school? You‚Äôre taking severe detriments kids already want keep even longer? True - places remain open normal, restrictions distancing number people allowed inside one time. 

Public run swimming pools sport arenas remains closed, privately owned gyms open business, restrictions per above.

In past week following Stockholm:

* Attended workshop local training center. Normal class room 12 persons, extra precautions extra social distancing indoors.

* Went dinner friend local restaurant beers. Limits set amount people allowed inside seated table service only.

* Went gym semi-daily basis. Extra sanitary procedures place limited amount people allowed inside time.

* haircut, drop-in without pre booking. Barbers wearing face shields extra cleaning procedures place tools.

* Used metro (off peak hours). would say mask use 25% inside train.

* Went grocery shopping. Limits amount people allowed inside shop time - take clothespin entrance bring back leave (to keep track amount people inside). Mask use inside shop approximately 25%. people think would happen? mentally ill this, gets worse given pandemic. People shamed anything seems. I've noticed much gatekeeping social media real life pandemic black white situation. People can't stay house interact one 1-2 years. Phils lockdown long harsh. hours hit. It‚Äôs unbelievable folks put with; severe domestic travel restrictions, mandatory masks face shields outdoors Manila, plus allowing age groups go all. nation state trolls thread. Eh no. EU best effort contract UK. 

EUs contract even DATED EARLIER UKs contract. 

Everyone act like bad contract slow, absolutely not. Buy-N-Large coming through. Sure can. we? Keep kids another six months? year? risk/benefit analysis change? Building ventilation fresh air in, old air needs completely rethought world engineering culture. huge wake call us respiratory virus behavior mostly forgot since 1918 flu. Tip efficient headlines: Add description country/region it. California, pharmacists provide vaccines. Dodger stadium site largely coordinated USC School Pharmacy. also know reinfections variants exist. also know trials occurring children vaccinated. wait several months children vaccinated. vaccination plan (or specifically using AstraZeneca herd immunity). guess helped come it. don‚Äôt mean sound crass we‚Äôre talking people could taken common cold. it‚Äôs COVID, it‚Äôs going something else. one grandma who‚Äôs 85 one grandma who‚Äôs 67. They‚Äôre high risk 85 year old constantly verge death way younger grandma isn‚Äôt. 67 year old gets COVID vaccine, probably won‚Äôt immediately die something else next months. Canada. First Nations often referred to. Somewhat regional, it‚Äôs big country lots First Nation M√©tis communities unique histories cultures. USA many super-spreaders working overtime. know vaccine covid much effective flu vaccine. caretakers vaccinated, don‚Äôt see reason keep kids school. Screw buddy. whole shit ‚Äúright‚Äù people vaccine needs fuck right off. 

People getting mad people getting vaccine opportunity presents self vile. applauding anyone gets vaccine every single person gets vaccinated contributing end pandemic. COVID-19 flu. flu, class would back session. think CDC documentation explanations two you‚Äôd like explore differences further. know mean compliment. 

It clear though, conversation go well engagement said work favour. 

And incredibly transparent attempts obfuscating that, equally transparent need continually proclaim victory, obviously resulted awful lot actually saying nothing, need pretend me. ‚ÄúIf talk anybody experience epidemiology infectious diseases, tell risky you‚Äôll wind many infections vulnerable people, lead hospitalizations death,‚Äù - Dr. Fauci exact article posted.

I'm sure ""known principles immunology"" referring to, goal always avoiding number infections hospitalizations would cause health care system, nearly happened LA county... worry. already it, side effects much worse first dose. Costco pharmacy administering variety vaccines years. trained. Designed fiddling kids. Politicians always politicians... need immunity herd mentality. Ok it‚Äôs actually vaccination plan zero faith in? It‚Äôs him? hundred percent agree education system hard anyone atypical, especially outside Inclusion, disability works others others like definitely extends beyond academic classroom affects life, personally glad word. learn differently altering teaching style differentiation make brain suddenly start working like neurotypical one, personally prefer term disability! 

As mask thing, think perhaps person making sensible general statement - masks definitely difficult wide variety people I'm glad there's awareness that. guess gets semantics call ""wave.""

Assuming variant comes along make mRNA vaccines almost useless, there's really room left large-scale growth infection US. might little room small growth cases March/April, know I'd call ""wave."" need smarten weld doors shut. keep kids home flu season? Reinfections far less likely child dying flu. Basically one year mark. Thats kinda poetic reluctance listen science going screw progress guys made. vaccine rollout achieve herd immunity (as article claims), guys Covid back Australia soon border restrictions loosened. something stupid deadly done elsewhere doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs acceptable California. saying could another wave, it'll essentially blunted mass vaxx program? I'm hopefully going helping rollout area soon, I'll glad contribute blunting can. Gotta go overtime get super-spreading back up! Reinfections exist, mutations coronavirus. recall may need booster shots different variants virus this. It‚Äôs better safe kids vaccinated rather learn later they‚Äôve vector silently killing relatives. explain mean this? Canada here. fuck mom's vaccine please. California even pass Prop 15 last year. Democrat brainier anyone gives shit schools. There‚Äôs TONS proof. I‚Äôm personal google. said initial post, don‚Äôt see it, believe intentionally ignoring it. Literally type posted google click enter. hundreds articles citing exactly saying. you‚Äôre willing google, think point intentionally avoiding evidence correct. jesus

Some sentiment internet would convince otherwise Yeah, heck. haven‚Äôt sub while... people stopped caring? people they‚Äôre going spread vaccinated - what‚Äôs danger? Well proves Trumpists correct, need worry virus. milder form flu.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh wait, actually reading article seems virus far worse flu Kansas flu 1918-1919. yes, according records first showed Kansas, Spain. Try size Yanks. Nice mean know vaccine eventually gonna get full authorization. data shows it‚Äôs overwhelmingly safe effective. Seems like distinction without meaningful difference point crazy ask plan way. Half kids country school. Sort deaths per capita state. cannot find correlation states full person states closed. 

My son 600 person elementary school. typical elderly teachers staff. 3 confirmed cases 6 months. Kids full person, day. emergency authorization yes, normal authorization it‚Äôs workplace requirement assume partial/all liability. complain. Unions job literally fight members, even ill informed. blame them, I'd pissed paying dues union sat thumbs.

Just take grain salt make statement. I'm say possible not, I'd rather find favor reaching herd immunity vaccines. far numbers plummeting, dont see ""herd gaining natural immunity."" Obviously cases spiked hard following month long holiday season Thanksgiving New Years. result, lot states ramped restrictions again. people stopped traveling visiting January February, combination heighten restriction steady vaccine distribution, obviously cases decline. much blood brain barrier tuff defense penetrate..... Lol. Keep dreaming. Millions would still need work even ‚Äúreal‚Äù shutdown. police officer would go home see wife. wife works grocery store. wouldn‚Äôt actually stop spreading. 

That, won‚Äôt locking again. Idgaf government says. I‚Äôm willing 10s millions agree. 

And, would we? Cases 75% last month? Biden it!! Wow, always surprises people posts ""sources"" fail back claims. Dr. Fauci calling ""nonsense"" wind many infections vulnerable people, lead hospitalizations death.

Which exactly stated original post. say ""wouldn't work"". insinuated stupid stand-alone strategy would cause massive amounts deaths / disability. guess ... did. 

You owed apology peddling massive human suffering viable strategy. people decline others take do, good samaritan.
Some decline health reasons, weak (if chemo f.i.), scared weak.
And scared ofcourse.
Some Reallllly scared needles.

As long 80% becomes immune, fine.
So 1%, extremely good. mutates better. can't trust teachers open window safely, maybe something wrong. let open windows wanna, sheesh! Good point. goes hand hand. non-compliance mask usage led variants. already is. paying attention, realize deliveries already ramping we're hitting new highs every day. Canada gonna pretty fine summer rate. mRNA astonishingly effective. game changer even beyond Covid extent... 

There‚Äôs term popularised called [the network it‚Äôs essentially reason still Facebook account even though wanted give 5+ years - loved ones around world use can‚Äôt get I‚Äôve got more/better means contacting every single one OK, that's reasonable post, thank you, still things I'd pick really important aspect clinical trial system informed consent - people affected risk adopting new therapy trial going fully aware decision making risks take accepting it.

This clinical trial idea informed consent still important. Everyone offered vaccine refuse safety information published [UK's independent medicines think [members public] option electing vaccination regimen tested known efficacious. 

I respectfully disagree opinion. Someone wants second dose three weeks rather twelve delaying first dose someone else. Everyone right refuse treatment: mean have, have, right dictate want treatment skipped steps process that's put place save lives, evidence place justify latest Israeli study arrived. 

Again, made rational decision based available evidence. twelve week gap been, evidence, ineffective receiving dose regimen would need additional vaccination. Saying evidence justify repeating fundamental point disagreement us - agree evidence well-designed RCT gold standard evidence here, reject idea type evidence used making rational choice. using 12 week gap indeed save lives keeping 3 week gap would tragedy - policies people die. going period rapid decline cases deaths, would posit we're reaching ""group immunity"" among risk getting Covid, opposed ""herd immunity"" covers entire population. \*critical\* distinction.

The ""group"" includes engaging risky behavior pandemic - includes front-line workers families well take many precautions, eat restaurants, hang friends forth.

However, leaves half population, carefully wearing masks, avoiding unnecessary social contact adhering safety protocols. group nowhere near group immunity. fact, would catastrophic group led believe ""all well"" could return life usual prior universal vaccination.

Unfortunately, headlines like undermining public's adherence Covid safety. vaccinations keep accelerating actually bring us true herd immunity, sacrifice last year wasted public lets guard exposes themselves, believing danger past. There's reasons cheer up. every day passes, production rates increasing governments seem mostly speeding up. There's also fact every time someone else gets jab, one less person infect you. there's fact still keep distance, wash hands, etc. That‚Äôs would expect. would alleviate doubt raw numbers provided. Spahn done nothing talking ass Nice! England, using variety venues provide vaccinations. supermarket chain called Asda providing vaccination clinics areas course don't. That's saying. said ""a doctor thinks always .1% people can't otherwise safe thing"" reference whole ""Fauci cagey whether two vaccinated people hug"". Fauci saying likely safe two vaccinated people hug rather 100% definitely always safe two vaccinated people hug rare cases true safe. he's doctor grasps always outliers rare cases. make choices time though. Every winter hundred people die _every day_ flu, clearly preventable lockdown since no-one dieing flu right now.

On global scale even worse, 4000 people die tuberculosis _every single day, year around_. much think we're save them? spend 0.02% GDP TBC research.

So please get high horse. think they've bought theirs? Argentina M√©xico manufacturing region That's great news hear! Let's hope true data politically repackaged BS. Open bars restaurants let people go back work. Remote work work! People need make money own, one time stimulation government. think confusing use age group percentage whole since mixing multiple age groups something happening 70s affect figure seeing. isolate 70s show infections deaths per 100 1000? Intranasal administration, good vaccine also mentioned even hospitals handle it, lot people would ""Krankenstand"" time. contrast elderly, people would missing jobs weeks. cannot keep schools open, half teachers gone.

While vaccine, good medication, would short-term game changer. Based picture TIL Chuck Norris Neanderthal. number new cases isn‚Äôt dropping fast enough. Israel lot children nobody 16 injected. So, cases keep coming. kids don‚Äôt typically die go ICU often elderly things getting better. I‚Äôm concerned lung scar tissue kids become commonplace don‚Äôt expand vaccine testing. sort herd immunity hard-hit areas risk people least first shot. think covers entirely, since seen similar declines countries much lower vaccinated share population. Nice. mom one ""IT ChanGeS dnA"" people got anyway wants see kids grankid sooner rather later, maybe there's hope

I mean point, society supposed do? live dangerous world vaccines best bet that. statistics hospitalization rates? DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR news week ago said already huge effect 70s far least affected age group. dont believe way really enforce en masse... said, people finding workarounds... Good.

Biden took office new administration started working solving obvious problem country had? Yeah that‚Äôs exactly meant. Misinformation. international community calling Israel provide Palestinian authority vaccines idea they‚Äôre talking about. Israel isn‚Äôt responsible healthcare Palestinian Territories makes sense - would Palestinian really trust vaccine given Israeli? 

The Palestinian authority said would procure vaccines Israel first foremost responsibility look people. everyone Israel vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt send doses countries anyway. mean contract made Pfizer probably wouldn‚Äôt allow anyway, since Pfizer relies Israeli data. 

Your news headline Gaza lazy journalism. Gaza difficult delicate situation, it‚Äôs basically terrorist group held enclave history shown large chunk goods sent West Bank destined bombs rockets. Israel procedures check goods aren‚Äôt going used fir terrorist purposes, case years. haven‚Äôt blocked vaccine Gaza, they‚Äôre merely holding safety checks atm they‚Äôre goods going Gaza Israel. 

As said, maybe go blame Egypt blockade Gaza well. much solidarity, whole world send vaccines Gaza cooperation Egypt. going slowly surely ohio, grandparents vaccinated scheduled round 2, mom received well (teacher)  Restrictions going end substantial amount population vaccinated. western countries, restrictions place summer western countries vaccinated around 50% populations then. benefit?

How killing/harming people (or even millions country hundreds millions) ''catching up''? kind twisted logic even using Russia sees anything harms rest world relative benefit Russia.

You're ''the world'', dude (arguably, world, fact, hates you). harming someone comes back bite ass really beneficial, demographic problems COVID must seem like gift conveniently targets disproportionately elderly population. That's probably they're using political tool shipping countries treat people.

Lol government make getting vaccinated mandatory people sceptical toward ad hoc solutions.

/s declaring restrictions

 declaring restrictions, nobody really enforces them. caution opening becausue believes hospitals overflowing young people then? threw without stats sure got idea. here!!! much agree. fact AZ dried explain 90% efficacy ""serendipitous"" result erroneous dosing saying anything absence 55 age suspicious. Let's see get join relaxed state dial back tension little bit find common ground.

To certain extent, decisionmaking process continuum; boolean yes-or-no decision means.

Your viewpoint taken extreme would us injecting people vaccines last July Phase 2 trials showed safe triggered immune response, efficacy data - would theoretically saved hundreds thousands lives. 

My viewpoint taken extreme would withhold approval AZ vaccine gather data resolve confusion caused low-regular vs regular-regular dosage mistake, despite fact show sort efficacy.

Neither right. recognize even best scientific studies provide evidence, answers, eventually need make judgment call based data telling us. 

This new problem. core argument, though, regulatory processes place require evidence based decision-making save us ourselves. Wanting aggressive deploying new therapy well-intentioned, new problem means - historically, time time best intentions led tragedy shortcuts taken. 

We put clinical trial processes place force us stop, gather data, certain new therapy deploying actually think ill effects.  We've already accelerated processes years due pandemic - guessing gut feeling-based decisions really undermine safety processes place, even well intentioned.

A really important aspect clinical trial system informed consent - people affected risk adopting new therapy trial going fully aware decision making risks take accepting it.

I'd feel differently UK's plan offering people _choice_ delay second vaccine dose help letting others vaccinated first. I'd support wholeheartedly, I'd probably even opt myself.

But people community dramatically higher risk, like medical workers, think option electing vaccination regimen tested known efficacious. UK unilaterally made decision people, giving ability consent untested dosage regimen - given decision supported scientific data, think bridge far.  They're effectively running no-consent clinical trial entire population.

I'm sure people made decision meant ill legitimately believed saving lives. I'm even arguing wrong vaccination strategy long run - may _actually_ saving lives. 

But skipped steps process that's put place _to save lives_, evidence place justify latest Israeli study arrived. think that's okay, don't. time, worked out, I'm happy everyone involved did. Next time, could next tragedy, though - could incredibly damaging whole world's vaccination efforts, causing far lives lost marginal saved aggressively shaving couple weeks timeline.  exact side effects, Pfizer, too. champion! know raw numbers percentages based? would easier understand way around. Oxford AstraZeneca full shit. Even Novavax got released 89% 49% thanks SA variant (B.1.351).

It's they're fault course. hell see something like coming. 3 months average 22% efficacy? I'm pissed tbh anyone, SA variant itself.

Without booster shot MAYBE ready Autumn everyone took vaccine basically armored tissue paper (gonna need it) taking 10 2 odd gamble reaches spread reach. turn tables Oh ok! side effects pretty much, got Pfizer vaccine. symptoms come 12 hours later, too. hard sleep. UK, everyone's parents grandparents people know vaccinated. know someone who's age 42 getting next week.

Glad see country something well once! no, good making excuses anything do?
The whole world seems callous ignorant genocide. Surely something. Stop spreading misinformation then. Congrats! Right giant headache, body aches, fever, chills earlier, seem gone. ""weeks delay"" ""massive international pressure"". None things writing true. Evidence emerged get 85% efficacy 1 dose. boost 12 weeks.

So vulnerable getting 2. makes sense initial rollout many possible Australia, New Zealand Taiwan dissagree people stopped caring?

Looks like have. damn time ever, told you, place discuss politics, ever say dear! Well, dad look similar picture shown here. Also quite hairy hot place. So, yeah. need DNA test lol. Nice weeks delay blockage Israeli government massive international pressure. one hurts Japanese! (We began vaccinate medical professional)Good news UK &lt;3 Ah yes. PM photo ops! need it? No! Us dispell myths spread members party wont pull line? Likely. Anything change news narrative turn blind eye rape allegations within party hey? I‚Äôm reading chart correctly 82.40 percent population vaccinated least one dose. 

No. every 100 people, 82 shots given, includes people getting doses. 

16% got one shot 33% got two shots. means 49% got least one shot (I got 16% subtracting two shots least one shot). elderly people. don‚Äôt quite understand, talk 95% efficacy, mean 5% people vaccinated within group still got, no? includes people exposed virus not. 98.9%? really badly worded title tell em‚Äô! Spain Windows classrooms open. idea leadership would true, covid death rate 100%. like everyone vaccine first day thing appeared, would 1.1% current death toll Seriously, country waiting first person get vaccinated. Cries Canada. Right? tf waiting guy approval hug family members?

JFC You‚Äôre welcome üôÇ No. RELATIVE risk reduced 98.9%. 

So everyone infected SARS-COV-2, IFR 1% unvaccinated person, risk vaccinated person dying would 0.011%. could wrong believe it‚Äôs saying 95 percent people prevented getting symptomatic covid. 5 % infected symptomatic covid 1.1 % resulted death. Apples oranges. nurses doctors say they've never experienced anything like before. read reports hospitals? staff close breaking point supply pipes oxigen starting fall apart. prick getting injection. Brother! rate probably wait another 11 months turn vaccinated.

You right though, however second wave would long behind us lockdown rules sensible properly enforced. Really, took 2 months working home finally mandated?

While home following rules, _every_ interest group busy lobbying exceptions (gathering churches still possible? exceptions Christmas? Industry refusing support working home?).

The government totally fucked up, virus nothing new November. excuse taking 4 months half-assed lockdown instead acting quickly strictly. Absence evidence evidence absence ! Time sanctions variants, people know they're free, without government telling them? exclusively American thing Yah, good secured vaccines. certain wasn‚Äôt thoughts prayers finally paying off? ü§î actually. Lemur monkeys still carried lot virus nasal cavities despite antibodies. wasn‚Äôt known whether would enough transmit not. can‚Äôt go hunches previous diseases since every one infects slightly differently. need clinical data receiving. Free Hugs T-shirt intend get mileage it! people, particularly children highest vectors spread.

Source? looking information spread coming from. even careful longer herd immunity stupid anti-vaxxers/vaccine nationalists though. Freak. might contribute model, gold standard TTI:
Just pick defined situations ask Covid-positives. one shows up, test whole environment. example, operators share machines different shifts without direct contact. CCTV environments. Offices different entrances common recirculating ventilation system.

Also, one ask 1k people come testing talk food items, blow nose touch food. food stored refrigerators dark shelves usual, tested vitro TCID50 time. Fair. I‚Äôve listened interviews he‚Äôs nuanced intelligent. little quips put headlines disingenuous best. 

But guess that‚Äôs really expect people. bet there‚Äôs single person life listened Osterholm Update read entire article Atlantic. People attention span gnat. what? Florida dude. understood anything thalidomide (and vaccines) work, would understand ridiculous sound.  freight driven UK final destination (which could Birmingham, Glasgow, Republic Ireland even) lorries people. 

There thousands lorry drivers parked middle nowhere could get COVID tests let go home. knows next 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs immunocompromised children vaccinated‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs children vaccinated‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs children vaccinated.‚Äù oh wow great job Israel! even promise EU countries double doses could provide? nuts? misinformation like hear it? Lol tough hear, think combination of

1. Hospitals steadily going down, (as yesterday) went level first 2 peaks. It'll probably another month levels good enough feel safe worrying third peak
2. Politicians learned hard way safer show caution sure open up.
3. think could bit give people hope, want watch giving people false confidence leads final large wave (and possibly mutations)
4. Restrictions *are* loosening slowly, doubt (except maybe places like Florida) gone once. NYC opened indoor dining last week, Philly increased indoor dining 50% cases couple weeks ago. 

My guess Spring see biggest lifting combination enough people vaccinated case numbers going materially able enough outdoor activities increased indoor activities cause new wave (e.g. go back 100% capacity indoor dining today Philly, everyone cabin fever rush dine inside, packing restaurants less 10% city received first dose 10 days ago. 6 weeks, it'll nice enough people things help disperse crowds). Need go faster still see nothing changed area far people conduct themselves, 

Does confirm that? stupidest thing ever..... type extreme risk aversion seems odd probably unwarranted. careful evidence points highly effective vaccines never really much reason suspect wouldn‚Äôt affect transmission. letter Lancet article confirms. Governments strategy built 89% efficacy &amp; article suggests 76% approx. Anyway let's see happens. Physical distancing (ie staying away every human part immediate, daily household) one public health policy really sustainable though. comments reference distancing (or lack thereof) places like stores restaurants, study focuses ‚Äúsocial contacts.‚Äù Telling population people combination vaccination never seeing friends family way prevent serious future outbreaks waves...it ain‚Äôt gonna fly. people careful anyway they‚Äôre immunocompromised/allergic/‚Äúwhatever‚Äù age groups started even firmly scheduled. last Friday still vaccinating first responders second dose doubt anywhere near finished yet. Oxford concerned safety elderly, would largely exclude phase 3 clinical trial

They largely excluded, included later trial significant numbers time interim results came cases older age groups occurred. Getting lots cases placebo arm vaccine trial amongst age group high chance hospitalisation death certainly moral ethical Wouldn‚Äôt hold back request approval age group, they‚Äôve done separate trial (which exactly adolescents)?

Because Oxford UK MHRA accept immunogenetic data (which shows similar responses older age groups younger ones) could still get approval largely younger age groups efficacy results only. Adolescents different none tested phase 1 2, note Moderna Pfizer also taking time testing group would exclude elderly trials include US arm?

US trial run Astrazeneca Oxford also started later better idea safety elderly explored earlier phase 3 trials run would Oxford still include elderly, first place? don‚Äôt want test old folks, would exclude ALL.

Because testing old people scaling old people slowly. First inject 2-3, fine 5-10 ect. way spot something injected least amount people vaccine could potentially harmful. said plenty old people trials vaccine vaccine bit later younger groups data terms efficacy yet public data (although certainly US old people phase 3 trial, enough statistical significant outcome. waste elderly‚Äôs time effort, volunteered trial.

Again 2 outcomes, primarily safety also efficacy. phase 3 trials also finished yet, cases accrue confidence intervals actions folks concerned safety elderly

Well are, choose believe problem. Yeah, send here, want/need all. misread it. I'm sure OP would even know that. DNA tests order like 23andMe sequence entire genomes test certain genetic variants (certainly ""known). 

Unless part research study, sincerely doubt OP know. Wherever. wonder effect would vaccinations targeting risk regions. Look reply relation post replied it.

My point UK infections drop 4k/d, would mean zero infections would false negatives contributing overall total. reason make mistake opening fast early. Wait two weeks go it. Well, first clue vaccine 99% efficacy respiratory illness unheard of.  
Disregarding that, Israeli science Twittersphere abuzz methodology, straight 'compare vaccinated vs non-vaccinated'. Zero percent age group received e vaccine Canada even started vaccinating age group anywhere Canada. like 80 inches Neanderthal last weekend That's freight transport closed. mean could close passenger transport. Good you. Skepticism case doesn‚Äôt impact anyone else perfectly fine, prudent even. household still thing- groceries get disinfected, packages get wiped plans put quarantine. Wallets/phones etc we‚Äôre exposed go UVC sterilizer. Person outside washes hands, removes clothes showers entering main house area. neighbours (30s) go tested December without symptoms someone met someone else tested positive... (in Berlin).

But yeah, continue mia san mia bavarian Propaganda. It‚Äôs bad skepticism AZ faces. Pfizer Moderna delivered miraculous efficacy rate doesn‚Äôt make AZ solution doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs actually still extremely strong, *cheap*, logistically simpler option definitely helps global battle virus. 

Should higher risk populations given highest efficacy vaccines? don‚Äôt mind that. supply issue, better take AZ none all! It‚Äôs still effective vaccines diseases offers great protection serious illness. Facts  Prob COVID-19-BCE ridiculously optimistic. sounds like we‚Äôre really close definitive proof vaccinated can‚Äôt spread unvaccinated. I‚Äôd understand caution know 100%.

Why would exclude elderly trials include US arm? 

Why would Oxford still include elderly, first place? don‚Äôt want test old folks, would exclude ALL. old people phase 3 trial, enough statistical significant outcome. waste elderly‚Äôs time effort, volunteered trial.

And record, thing that's ""cringe"" people using word cringe.  I'm glad found helpful diagnosis.

Just wanted emphasize ""it's only/all head"" frustrating diminishment someone's complaints. 

Depression PTSD real significant problems them. Mental health disorders worsen almost symptom stealing ability cope them. increase awareness pains, impair sleep, take away ability acts self care (exercise, nutrition etc).

So I'm glad found something seems better explain symptoms, think diminish mental health conditions.

After all, knowledge comes brain necessarily give someone ability suddenly fix issue. stroke head too... heart attack heart 

We need compassion peoples illness experiences. conditional emergency use registration, e–∞ficacy determined phase 3 trials commence registration (in March, believe).

Will interesting see results, theory whole-virion vaccines induce better immune response better working mutations. first article doesn‚Äôt say anything transmission, link says this:

Does prevent infection transmission?

We know whether vaccine prevent infection protect onward transmission. Immunity persists several months, full duration yet known. important questions studied. sounds like didn‚Äôt mild case. likely around half infections asymptomatic. evidence points infections giving fairly broad long last immunity. Certainly 3 months average, it‚Äôs around year data this. massive progress!! open all. access leisure sites like gyms, hotels theatres limited people doses vaccine week prior, recovered disease presumed immunity. people get ‚ÄúGreen Pass‚Äù status displayed Health Ministry app. take points trials, etc., anecdotes data, would hope significant numbers people getting seriously sick dying Covid post-AZ would heard now.

To honest, though, side I'm entirely sure trust NHS fudge reporting name ""the greater good""... Everyone know got never symptom got workplace. spread family members after. currently great.

Personal anecdotes mean much see. Firstly Oxford government 2 different groups.

Secondly time full roll happened, plenty data phase 3 results safety older people already accrued. question efficacy UK government judged similar older age groups younger ones using immunogenetic Surely concerned potential impacts elderly

They concerned safety initial scale up, elderly hundreds/thousands. concerned scaling beyond risk gets much lower, although UK rollout AZ vaccine slowed start monitor would delayed Phase 3 trials rather skipping entirely?

They skip Phase 3 trials, initial ones fewer older people reporting results would otherwise wanted, regulatory authorities that, many countries around planet approved vaccine phase 3 trial USA loads old people report soon. least states, making massive progress. see nothing changed area far people conduct themselves, numbers magically going down. Vaccine much effect? Well gladly take this. back norm state soon. No. hit herd immunity Eh dont paint picture based loud voices - cocky people ones boast whilst others probably post leading see types people (hopefully vast minority). 

I know personally roll eyes whenever see someone nation boasting, necessary constructive opens retaliatory remarks things start going way good old USA it‚Äôs yourself, screw thy neighbour. I'm exactly one week second Moderna shot feel like stomach flu. wondering thing: immune system suck reaction. use rest stops seem good mask wearing let 3 year old pee next car lol Every country polarized pandemic measures. experts predict January decline?

Yes. knew would peak December/January; predicted since last February. So, yeah, cases fall peak. We‚Äôre still higher side haven‚Äôt yet fallen pre-seasonal spike numbers quite yet. Yeah took road trip topsail. way back stopped shell gas station. Kids needing go bathroom. Looked shop saw seven 8 people unmasked.
Kids hold in. course. are. extraordinary stuff performed Celltrion! Unless he's psychopath, case, guilt all! enough people vaccinated yet anti maskers lie say vaccinated wear masks spreading further. think start seeing restrictions loosen early summer. come say quiet part already.

He knows damn well vaccines prevent transmission he‚Äôs playing dumb like vaccinated people need masks government fear people lying vaccinated.

We saw goddamn trick cloth surgical masks back March April last year. Pretending couldn‚Äôt sure would worked didn‚Äôt want public run masks.

Just tell damn unmodified, unmanipulated truth. know what‚Äôs going on. Got second shot yesterday little noon. almost 24 hours later. slept like crap arm really sore, that... mild aches think that's sleeping like crap. Overall feel... fine?

Does mean immune system sucks something barely reaction? possible injected subcutaneous fat instead muscle? (would arm still hurt them?) possible accidentally gave dose 1 again? best thing would vaccinate extroverts first. Germany average person died 84 2-3 pre existing conditions. states 50% nursing homes. Sure mean massive outbreaks concern hospital system overrun. Kindergarten college /uni level education. may shocking learn kids, including, never kindergarten. Europe arent morons, tyvm.

Problem is, journalists used kind journalism. used clickbait, sometimes bombastic headlines - situation needs.

There scientific journalists there, incredibly rare.

Btw talking 25-30 desks barely enough room get desk.

The state federal government really need find getting school reasonable class size/redesign give teachers pay deserve. That's completely flawed conclusion assumes died representative general population taking account age underlying conditions may already likely reduce lifespan. shitting woods. People need overcome biology. worst kind clickbait journalism. mean, Fauci supposed say? ""I swear reputation everything 100% back normal every American later July""? like, know story right - continue current rates vaccination variants contained, things probably semi-normal late summer, variants unforeseen issue could throw us curveball can't make promises. likely seasonal virus going endemic, outbreaks possible we'll want wear masks crowds next winter. likely we'll need booster shots next years. 

My assumption people going thrilled ""semi-normal"", actually, even though everyone preemptively griping. There's big difference ""coronavirus endemic ask everyone wear masks transit periodic closures area undergoing outbreak"" now. I'll happy get point forgetting mask slip big deal. always knew dragged knuckles reason  ""Only kills grandma's already deathbed"" crowd shambles. wipe things alcohol/wipes groceries dirty dusty hell. Yes, really hope real world results show higher end projections efficacy!

Ultimately vaccine 100% effective. traveled exotic country took typhoid vaccination precaution.... proceeded get typhoid. 4 weeks hospital foreign country. Lost 20kgs. Nearly serious operation trial medication finally worked. 

Just say think risk always remains life. certainly collateral, hope stay healthy safe. Personally, believe made right choice wish offered vaccine! got Moderna feb 10. injection site felt like sunburn, felt like drunk hours later mild headache also got little tired night earlier normal. Next day arm sore couple days that. Canada's defense 10th US population. dumb irrelavent statement Sputnik V reported 91% efficacy.

But sure, people would rather take twice good vaccine political hit job, preferring Western vaccine Russian one spite data pointing otherwise nothing politics Russia always painted bogeyman Western media politicians... Vaccines provide full protection. vaccines discussion provide substantial degree protection following one dose, protection increased still second. article one sentence. Stop posting low quality garbage. people use anything Fauci's name ferment outrage. state involvement.  well course CDC car showing online. think we're getting it. likely coincidence -- first peak/drop concentrated fewer places second, also second included reporting first (apparently Florida even reporting hospitalizations July). Well, yeah. said two weeks second. That‚Äôs really heartbreaking Right whole thing feels like worlds biggest balancing act expectations / realistic choosing words wisely set expectations deter people getting vaccine. called 800 number told couldnt help me. said nothing cancellation opportunities.

Yup Canadian hospital worker here. vaccine yet maybe month mean... Canada didn‚Äôt exactly roll welcome mat risk Americans endangered government‚Äôs reckless response pandemic. closed borders said good luck. family high risk people around us dismissive sort protective policy surrounding disease. terrifying. endured throughout process. ridiculed neighbors, leaders media taking sort caution. still unvaccinated. government decided shut went vaccine. living nightmare almost year would pretty pissed doses went north went arm. looking place flee to, European countries would taken us could afford move. country four hour drive us patently limits. That. Precisely. love Israel‚Äôs green pass approach. Every country adopting - although know it‚Äôll never work US. Probably unless actively tried stop students transferring. 

You required go Berkeley understand there‚Äôs way distinguish who‚Äôs vaccinated isn‚Äôt, maybe they‚Äôre waiting people get vaccinated saying go maskless 

This reason. think backfire though since reduce number people willing get vaccine. still follow restrictions vaccinated, see point getting it. No! need lockdowns!! Justin's Canada yes, specifying not, since person know not. Oh, come on. We're continuously touching surfaces whatnot throughout day, touching mouths, noses, eyes. say food meant go noses lungs, use kind argument, silliness. ‚ÄúIt makes sense‚Äù - Reddit user response leading health expert 40 years experience. principle, becomes issue statistics.

Suppose 100 people vaccinated, 100 not, behaving way protocols. Place groups 90% susceptible population.

If average, typical member unvaccinated group infects 2 people , per person, average member vaccinated group would infect 0.2 people per person. 

This really affects 'odds' infected person. per person, ability shed spread might become yes proposition. might not. Two scenarios numerically possible.

Example. Suppose 100 vaccinated people shedding, small rates. get basic reproductive number 0.2, shed little average each, difficult new infection take hold.

Now, consider 100 vaccinated people, different shedding pattern.  90 % shed, 10 shed 'a lot more', 10 people might infect 2 people average, overall group, would still yield R0, basic reproductive number, 0.2

We appear looking latter scenario, based cursory meta skimming research Pfizer Israel.  would also consistent somewhat observed phenomenon 'super spreaders', amongst population, people shed consistent rates. pattern appears happening vaccination, everyone's shedding attenuated baseline varies person person. 

It might seem like nuance, public policy standpoint, distinction actually important. scenario one, removing mask policy's might different outcome scenario two. could whip math model prove this, sure someone already has. Good thing Pfizer studying Israel perpetually, get good data en masse real world scenario, picture clarify, quickly allow us update public policy. *Chrump  United States forced vaccine manufacturers agree distribute vaccine US priority.

Well American manufacturers. course make priority. Data coming Israel says vaccine seriously cut infections. You‚Äôre getting people love masks part vaccines job. probably read article explains numbers work. basically, younger person death, years lose, small number deaths younger people account proportionally larger number years life lost.

Think way. 10 people die covid. 6 old years left best. 3 late middle age lose 1-2 decades life. One unlucky person sample 30 loses 55 years. Average out, mean number years lost substantially higher median. sounds like BS Reddit grievance directed entire country, sensible vaccine distribution policy. choice, I‚Äôd prefer Pfizer Moderna I‚Äôm going wait around global pandemic.

Beggars can‚Äôt choosers feel tension lifted last couple months. mean want never near zero. Maybe deaths cases? No. South African variant: *knock knock* kid doesn‚Äôt need mask. kid needs normal life back. Seriously thjs upsetting mom child‚Äôs happiness going forward going ruined legit nervous nellies bray science data ignore data says covid kids basically non issue. finally know someone vaccinated, it‚Äôs health care worker. Found yesterday he‚Äôs got shots Pfizer vaccine already.

Knowing people actually getting vaccinated gives hope. Unless Biden one greatest logistical politicians time, hard believe America went one biggest covid disasters one greatest vaccine distributions world without *some* kind headstart previous administration topic Great thank you. Isn‚Äôt wild words issued colloquially meanings may synonymous? 

Still doesn‚Äôt help, highlights much stickler word, validity point

Hope helps too! from? Maybe could trade dew whatever produce? That‚Äôs great hear. deserve much efforts front line. Glad things heading right direction work sounds like it‚Äôs getting bit less stressful. You‚Äôd rather get Covid die wait Memorial Day vaccines widespread life start normal? 

The ‚Äúdoom gloom‚Äù sub gone doom gloom world ending Covid deaths doom gloom world ending Covid restrictions. reason force masking fully vaccinated people. think they‚Äôre waiting people get vaccinated issuing guidance sense is. US democracy. people want restrictions, politicians get rid restrictions voted out. Might surprising Trump actually good job focusing vaccines. seems WH approach fall rely vaccines prioritised that. something documented 

His administration deserves credit they're due pushing vaccines hard eliminating roadblocks along way. It‚Äôs paying despite whatever shortcomings happened earlier, including Trump getting sick.

By ""Whatever Shortcomings"", surely mean hundreds thousands highly preventable deaths right?

Neglecting much public health policy side things shirk responsibility states scummy move. Probably 200 million people getting vaccine (taking minors assuming percentage get it), 200 days everyone wants gets second shot. dad currently ICU. mom exposed day mom right mild symptoms. dad‚Äôs nurse told mom get tested unless gets worse assume virus quarantine 2 weeks. 

I thought tests readily available anyone? still common tell someone mild symptoms get tested? institution would get set anonymized medical records compare lifespan conditions covid. Oh, mean Fauci said one thing said something different suited him? Almost like he's caught lying public multiple times already? agree lot guy says understand anybody chooses trust point. watch news show medical ‚Äúexperts‚Äù hear said...

(Completely fucking kidding, never shake title) Dude I'm you, Canada, that's lie schedule. Hold vaccine, I‚Äôm going in! flu shots, parental-neglect killed them

You're dolt. Slightly misleading headline - first thought meant US vaccinating people per day Canadians total, i.e. 38 million per day. remembered US isn‚Äôt vaccinating *that* many per day, yet.

Pfizer Moderna domestic companies. feel like moment covid appeared, already lost vaccine race. it‚Äôs pretty apparent people posting thread didn‚Äôt even read article, here‚Äôs actually said:

""You know, think possible that's case and, again, really depends mean normality.""

So basically, actually said pretty damn vague. think it‚Äôs fair interpret actually said mean that, ‚ÄúSOME Americans may continue voluntarily wear masks public protect COVID (and respiratory viruses) future, although won‚Äôt norm completely voluntary.‚Äù 

What don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs saying (and headline many posters thread trying lead believe) is, ‚ÄúSorry, we‚Äôre living permanent dystopia Americans must continue wear masks public permanently never partake activities conducive social distancing.‚Äù 

Christ alive people, know it‚Äôs fun miserable try sensationalize things head please get grip, use brain try understand nuance. PLEASE love God actually read beyond headline. wear masks indefinitely? thought vaccine key ending pandemic. Makes sense tell people fully vaccinated wear masks still. understand there‚Äôs way distinguish who‚Äôs vaccinated isn‚Äôt, maybe they‚Äôre waiting people get vaccinated saying go maskless miss days going store wear mask crystal ball agree shouldn't, we've never make decisions like context modern American civilization, I'm worried sense scale regard decision making processes.

We seen post-Trump bump need stick random partisan politics this. Let's wait end year least assess that. New variants virus could well spread far wide current vaccinations even conclude essentially putting us back square one. frustrating. 29 y/o Canadian living US, vaccinated weeks ago. dad back home Ontario 60 y/o, diabetic, essential worker (cab driver) doesn‚Äôt vaccine anywhere sight. everyday worry exposure üòû Warp speed got us part way here. Knock wood hopefully even sooner factoring combination natural immunity (estimates vary, probably 50-100 mill range right now), albeit surely overlap vaccine. Could easily like 70%+ immunity point April

There‚Äôs good chance recent trend cases continues (and perhaps boost spring weather?), could mean meaningful community spread negligible like beginning May

Fingers crossed Right? hell would anyone that?

Because Covid still thing? infectious/deadly variants, fully know extent spread transmission vectors compared original version? might still transmit vaccinated people unvaccinated ones? Maybe that? 

You go ahead 'sorta safe'. I'm gonna make sure I'm damn well safe. Lmfao, idiots voted Joe Biden wanted Fauci... stay. Uhm, agree but.

21,000 dead vs 497,000 dead, scoreboard date yet so... Yeah, want get vaccinated. care vaccine. People love security theater, often probably even ignoring actually safe risky. I'm sure there's people rigorously decontaminate anything outside house still going people's houses outside household bubble (see people thought safe Christmas actually mixing five different groups contacts), completely ignoring evidence suggests mixing household bubbles indoors way higher risk bringing outside materials. one annoying things see people probably think they're perfect example careful, lot cases practically ends show. going go crazy mitigating risks least work ones make real difference first. thought delayed gratification hallmark white culture US, though?

Why would wear masks adults opportunity get vaccine amounts sniffles children.

This kind anti-risk thinking dangerous fuck kids lot worse catch COVID. federal government authority outside federal property airports/planes enforce mask wearing anyways.

my issue it. system could handle weight volume constituency clamoring aid systems decades old unable keep demand. fundamentally issue government's efforts

the solution simple - already gave us federal stimulus, continued incrementally (with frequency) throughout pandemic.

if can't check citizens government needs retooled that's able least amount difficulty. theory yes. quite capacity administer shots. think entire holdup getting vaccines facilities administering. Europeans sat watched genocide carried Japanese Asia nothing, started years prior German invasion Poland 1939. get involved sooner? reasons WW2 nothing genocides occurring (which really fucked part) due aggressive expansion nationalistic facist regimes Europe Asia. clear, though, policy like really benefits *illegal* immigrants (many actually immigrants much migrant workers make money send home).

What‚Äôs source this? US government invested $10 B vaccine development, part Operation Warp Speed. thing laser-focused administration 4 years vaccine development. Still issues local supply chains it‚Äôs far perfect
But getting way get historical CDC vaccine data? get website current numbers.  Ok. happened? Yeah think early summer good timeline given vaccine numbers. think people say ""it's going rest year"" that's much prediction way signalling ""I put rest year can't, bad person."" thank Operation Warp Speed former President Trump positive news true. countries choose buy full allotment, countries buy extra doses, Denmark done whenever possible.  settings like hospitals may still require them, average person businesses still requiring long.

hospitals, public trans, maybe grocery stores fall, maybe winter. would guess everywhere else lifted long that.  Hell yeah love America #1 country blessed god free guns free speech come n take Crazy happens adults charge yet, idiots continue reply. don‚Äôt care soooooo hard.  think start seeing restrictions loosen early summer.

we mask mandates fall, longer. Now, loosening restrictions starting now. masks, situations makes sense continue wear reach 75% vaccinated. honestly big deal.  annus horribilis

on bright side, vaccines rolling out, many people practicing safe preventative measures, cases (etc) strongly trending down. 

(and good bit seasonality help us along way) agree, lot shirked responsibility parts. think would also agree Cons would screeching wasted tax payer money Liberals tried anything Covid tackle vaccine production problems. 

Meanwhile Cons selling tax payer assets balance budget every time they're power. Please careful. Long term covid patients speculated breeding grounds new variants... selecting new variants vaccinated individuals good way get new variant population works around vaccine. manufacturing kept shall see spike soon bit odd pseudo virus decreases titer results show less issue compared real world ones Novavax trial. Novavax Moderna lab studies almost identical neutralization ability Novavax maybe tiny bit better. difficult see results jive unless reason Pfizer hugely better two vaccines. letting take risk. choice; they're plane right now. wrote comment vent. Lol think current mandates bit different considering supposed temporary targeted intervention

The problem problem ill-defined. trying flatten curve? Prevent hospitals overrun? Prevent disease death? knows!  fine idea conceptually interesting Yes, actually do. hinders communication, brings general morale, creates hostility divide, huge ocean pollution disposable masks, damaging developing children...these effects mandate nearly bad lockdowns I'm saying really justified cause problems people risk vaccinated? can't sacrafice indefinitely risk people society can't get vaccine, somewhere draw line. Friendly reminder fall every headline see article. Thanks. US expected everything everyone  huge guaranteed order US didn‚Äôt help s/

You twisted definition everything everyone. Here's going American global pandemic.

* first wave caught Covid March. tests available. get breathing assistance urgent care. infection severe side someone hospitalized. prescribed inhaler breathing problems.
* Confirmed Covid antibody test June. 
* February 2021, 8 months antibody test, got bill insurance decided antibody testing necessary.
* vitamin deficient 2019 started prescription supplements. pay pocket initial vitamin test.
* confirmed Vitamin back normal test early 2020. Insurance cover follow-up test either. Based know Covid, paying pocket Vitamin testing might thing kept hospital. 

All this, despite electing Democrat president winning house senate Democrats doubt we'll see meaningful change public health policy. didn‚Äôt (the USA) get blasted brothers north

I mean, let's real. Trump fucked big time handling virus. US (specifically Trump folk) deserved criticism. Now, US (specifically vaccine companies) deserve praise. Yes. Lots (American) teachers told doors closed locked times case school shootings safety concerns. Bad weather happens. Sick media acting like days delayed vaccinations catastrophic overall effort.  country island kept grandma's economic recovery?

Massachusetts contact tracing, required quarantine, travel fines, mask mandates, lockdowns, curfews... lost grandma's arizona those...

Idk two different places opposite approaches yield outcome ""masks lockdowns work"" florida cali... Sweden european country... administration deserves credit laser-focused developing eventually rolling vaccine. 

This isn‚Äôt really happened though. Pfizer independently invested heavily German company turns even real vaccine rollout plan. Moderna might‚Äôve taken money, government little actual vaccine development process. private company scientists. 

Besides that, ‚ÄúLaser-focused‚Äù isn‚Äôt really word applicable part Trump administration. EU countries done bad terns death rates. Denmark Finland one actually done fairly well terms keeping death rate somewhat low kids got back March terrifying experience life. hope never go anything like that. It‚Äôs possible care things aren‚Äôt problem. issue wearing mask protect others long takes. don‚Äôt think asking people wear masks longer pausing society. Canadian feels weird experiencing reverse-smug syndrome. Like said...these stories tragic sad, look actual hospital occupancy rates, average around 75% yr round rise 90% every flu season normal year, see apocalypse. maybe, error reporting data, so, even bigger problem. God damn tired told simply soap glasses prevent happening. paid extra anti glare coating I'm going use dammit. Australia going this. didn‚Äôt quite say even did, remember medical professionals going tell us need eliminate risk... that‚Äôs job. take leave it. followed every bit advise medical professionals would fast food restaurants (at least current form), everyone would get 30 minutes good exercise day, nobody would smoke, etc.

As society, we‚Äôll take advise consideration make decisions. wearing masks next year. Many us ditch mask soon case/ death counts drop acceptable level. Trudeau pathetic failure Yeah, part totally cool hundreds thousands Jews murdered Japan bombed us. 

I don‚Äôt think ringing defense America think is. honestly suspect people might believe Fauci could one them. he‚Äôs trying soften blow, crucifying comments stop ever getting point. Given severity flu, public officials like Fauci may attempting make masks permanent, least November thru March. Really population seemed pretty irrelevant discussing case death totals vaccinated, so, yes. not, maybe wear mask. sure want see you. Thank opinion. mean imply built facilities within year, meant kept many years ago situations may arise, even scale small. Relying countries 100% certain types medical manufacturing risky. mean technically level immunity creates selection pressure, sterilizing levels immunity also stops virus point. allowing internet trolls form narrative?  oh noes, theoretical proposal wearing thin piece fabric face order get back normal life! unfair! Waaaah! *Israel trying help Palestine* sure man. I'm really sick headlines stories like comparing countries. USA much based USA needs? Canada it?

The dick measuring contest getting old. seams reasonable. actually tested positive day got approval get vaccine next day. I'm registered another county get late March, I'll take then. Worldometer shows 510k already US citizen, think inevitable US would able use global economic power get vaccines early on, mention one main vaccines given developed US. 

It sucks countries even US, may months vaccinated. Hopefully smaller population countries, like Canada, supply increases relative demand, vaccination rate much quicker countries. course Canada gave lots money! Canada gave money wrong companies wrong time. little late. Trudeau didn‚Äôt want seen playing nice sandbox DJT (on one hand...I kind get it) prioritized virtue signaling what‚Äôs best Canadians.

Let‚Äôs go Canada !  surprised fiasco spells end Trudeau come election time. Conservatives going point finger saying ""the reason child get vaccinated Trudeau enough"", people going eat up. 

It's shame too, even really Trudeau's fault. We've tried numerous times secure vaccinations unfortunately come empty. Fauci changing story, people incapable carefully reading listening. 


""We able start vaccinating general population April"" ""We done vaccinating general population July"" contradictory statements, \*feel\* contradictory lot less astute news consumers. point we're going need come together deal loss caused. mentioned Pfizer? data statmap comes COVID Tracking Project, CDC, aggregation state's daily reports. sources generally agree average sources taken.

Why think approach wrong. error? take weekends holidays off. They're humans worse year hospitals. bald dude caught Neither Trump Pfizer take Warp Speed money üòÇüòÇ Ease. *Ease.*

#*EASE*  NYC actually kind flat compared rest state (and country). Still 5% state numbers around 8% city numbers (which factor rapid tests thus probably useful).

When second wave started, NYC actually significantly lower numbers rest state. NYC region highest positivity percentage though numbers really changed much. rest state spiked declined.

You‚Äôll mad didn‚Äôt get burgers nights friends. Again, short sided.  could confirm that? That's unfalsifiable claim. EU bias anything UK? Nah, isn't. MHRA wipe floor EMA bud. I'm dual citizen get best worlds.

I realized two nights ago Muay Thai going ape bag realized one day soon- without mask wtf face right now? face normally this? faces do?

I miss warmth winter lack people telling smile, smile more, look prettier smiled, lemme see smile...

But damn, love work summer mask on. would anyone listen armchair epidemiologist uses 'thru'.

Fucking lol! point vaccinated covid won‚Äôt kill certainly won‚Äôt getting vaccinated 31-year-old virtually chance dying.

The actual point getting stop spread go back normal. literally consistent I've quoted, cautioned would earliest possible timeline predicting trials would complete, include time takes Food Drug Administration make final decision approve data, so. surprising semblance rational thought. anyone making presumptions individual case? article conclusions regarding aggregates huge populations... actually think I'm saying, exactly question life expectancy among COVID victims far complex age comparisons indicate. kids wearing masks foreseeable future. yet sure wife also wear solidarity/to lead example. You‚Äôre alone. I've hoping would happen years traveling Japan Korea, I'm desperately hoping will, given many people ridiculously actual pandemic, doubt they'll colds illnesses :( agree - also see contradicts Fauci saying: hopefully start open vaccines everyone soon, get people vaccinated summer, kids getting vaccinated fall early 2022. consistent recent claim 2022 hopefully start see something resembling normalcy. headline shit? Fauci says mask-wearing could continue 2022; headline restates that. Even Canada saying we‚Äôre good shape. Kind makes wonder Fauci‚Äôs comments masks 2022 way dampen excitement good news. 
I see conversation now. Governors : Mr President, people getting excited. need people follow rules anything would embarrass us. 
Biden: fine. I‚Äôll throw Fauci CNN talk masks. Canadian article, American article. Canadian couldn‚Äôt pay move US Much safer without, want increase odds wear mask well.  Raw daily case count misleading. 


When 10k cases shut last March, 100k tests per day. probably catching 1 15infections.

In April 30k cases per day, averaging 150k tests per day. probably missing 10 infections every one detected. 


Today average 1.5 million tests per day (with capacity go 2 million, need many moment) probably missing 2 infections every one catch. 


In terms actual infections, COVID pretty close lowest levels ever US. Another week declines we'll actual lowest. really big deal put mask crowded subway train, bus etc.

Yes is. It‚Äôs dehumanizing years Asia

You obviously never Asia. America Jr.'s entire sense nationhood comes idea they're somehow better America expect much Fauci unreasonable. That's necessarily true.

And masks don‚Äôt feel right social situation, it‚Äôs super hard identify facial expressions; it‚Äôs flat hard talk understand people. assuming storage adequate  know couple people 1st wave 3rd waves quite sure would know whe herd immunity reached. different strains different transmissabilities. think know reached 3 months reached before.  ""capitalist mindset"" blame? People socially distancing wearing masks enough. That's scientific ignorance, stubbornness, selfishness, things. personal choices people wanting go Thanksgiving bars fault capitalism? important thing young people establish independence parents. Go work part time job high school studies serious, work little money start assert world. I'm bit older wish would've started age. mRNA vaccines definitely much better positioned reduce cases, hospitalization, deaths variants. thinking something like that. glasses wearers go effort make sure air escape top general masks fit better.

If true, good argument wearing masks wearing properly, think anyone would convinced already Living next community 8% positive rate. Vaccine distribution needs equal across state phase 4 reopening disastrous us. Except vaccine work intended want cases skyrocket people going maskless want noticeable shift showing drastic affect occurring due vaccines stop putting much pressure mask wearing. going well tech savvy. states restricting doses select portion population, due limited availability. Doctors Elderly eligible, much harder make sure get reasonable time.

The demand outstripped supply since *day one*. We've seniors *camping outside* Florida. never moment number doses exceeded number eligible interested people. saying blatantly false. Ah, CNN. they‚Äôre totally trustworthy.

[Here‚Äôs Dr. Fauci saying complete opposite reserve vaccines non-existent even though Trump admin, started literal scratch, got almost 800k vaccinations day. 

You spout fake news day. doesn‚Äôt make right. USA 1.5 vaccines day (and yes Pfizer works U.K. variant) 60k cases day. race vaccines would ahead mile. hopefully gets 2M 3M day coming weeks months. It‚Äôs also proven stop transmission. Oh forgot mention found one dose extremely effective too. good news. Imagine that. point vaccine isn‚Äôt eradicate virus. It‚Äôs get stop killing people plain simple. still catch give fatigue sniffles cares. could wrong article Israel, Israel seen ton U.K. variant since mass vaccination .....cases declining, like globally. positive enough doom gloom shit. Also stated find articles , tons different strains rest world even knew it. know wasn‚Äôt different strain tore north east USA early new one ripped south summer third one destroyed Midwest late summer early fall fourth one completely took California? point probably many strains floating around one would even know. ones know another way news stay relevant months. Vaccines work. Get it. Cases could go back currently going everyone needs happy 2 seconds. ‚ÄúAll schools England reopen pupils 8 March prime minister's roadmap lockdown announced tomorrow, outdoor after-school sports activities also allowed restart.

And date, outdoor recreation one person also permitted, meaning people allowed sit together park coffee, drink picnic. 

From 29 March, larger groups able meet outside - including private gardens - maximum six people two households.

Tennis courts, golf courses outdoor sport facilities also reopen 29 March, first Monday schools' Easter holidays.

At time, organised adults children's sport, including grassroots football, restart.


The relaxation measures first stage four-part roadmap expected include reopening non-essential retail hospitality coming months.

But restrictions eased step-by-step across whole England, avoiding return previous system regional tiers.‚Äù mean plenty scientists far smarter dude saying delaying second dose 3 months perfectly fine even improves efficacy... 2 months behind think bad thing. surprising think. Uh, manufacturer says can't export vaccines UK government allow it. talking about? I‚Äôm sure nothing US production facilities Canada any.

You know sold production facilities Canada? Oh meant April USA. Well, age well :) humans too, expect work 24/7 u bozo State vaccination dashboard.

Here's example. clearly see 'healthcare heroes' relaxed people died: Like said, see year two, trying help stranger out.

Edit: grammars Yes, pick up. they're setting systems figure get general public signed up, set appointments get facilities set major centers set up, doses available send mass invites go get dose it'll go quicker.

I know three people qualify got doses. One works nursing/ elder care facility, one healthcare one disabled adults. three work set day mobile vaccination clinics came work. efficient. 

Mass vaccination sites set up. issue buy distribute vaccine doses. relying multiple layers disbursement.

On top lot early qualifying people hard reach. Elderly easy way signing 20-something good smartphone. sign parents local 'put waitlist' site. Lol neither think vaccines readily available vaccinations drop since people want got result significant drops case counts. guess sometime fall see mask usage drop drastically. Science absolutes.  Canada, national identity built around comparing vis-a-vis Americans. experience hard, yes, sucks you‚Äôre missing chunk once-in-a-lifetime season life.

I want say, though, 3-year-old lived least third life quarantine, incredibly formative time socialization language. We‚Äôll playing catch-up she‚Äôs 4 5, likely, means we, too, missing once-in-a-lifetime season life; we‚Äôll never normalcy taking zoo starting learn animals, taking play dates, able train stores restaurants would adaptive. toddler dance music classes. familiarity grandparents. Etcetera.

Just throwing there. You‚Äôll able reconnect people, you‚Äôve able play zoom whatever them. kid‚Äôs toddlerhood gone. Even build new vaccine production facility - would finished timeline we‚Äôre going receive vaccines. sophisticated buildings requiring least year planning, top needing get specialized tools equipment manufactured installed- incredibly hard come entire world trying get thing. 

The thought contractors go build vaccine production facility months completely naive. wonder begin allow Americans case numbers lower. 

If Tam's interest space program pans think USA much better shape couple weeks. Germany lockdown since Christmas. Wrong. little bit place here. Guess stress 9 months lockdown would get well.

AZ provided information UK EU approved it.

AZ increased gap, data used Lancet also part submission. brain drain EMA moving London fault, bad timing hit pandemic. 

AZ 65+ issue 600+ people 2 tested positive. number antibodies high showed similar reaction people 65. stretch say would work.

Pfizer 3 week extension. exactly stretch imagine would still effective, vast majority vaccines also better results gap initial jab.

RISK. say increasing time booster awful impact, bad would death? No. let's say stopped working booster would zero impact. vaccines market people could those, also people hard lockdown. double (if more) lives saved.

BTW1: scientists made decisions politicians kept it, make comment EU fuckup apart started going batshit crazy agitating paramilitaries Article 16.

BTW2: herd immunity created vaccinating people, realise EU different plan. Explains stoking anti Vax. Regarding unnecessary deaths, yep seem trying damnest join us learning mistakes craply done lockdowns.

Enjoy spring, know am. think Americans feel lots optimism vaccine rollout progress towards easing restrictions entirely future. UK vaccine rollout going even better US, there‚Äôs hardly much talk easing restrictions even though looks likely vulnerable groups well protected end March rest population follow suit July. feel lots optimism virus related metrics restrictions still extremely strict - 1 hour exercise day (not policed), limited local area (subjective definition local police may stop ask you‚Äôre going), meeting others outside household essential businesses open. feels like we‚Äôve somehow gone mad; months ago predicted vaccinations would go restrictions would go along it. thought predictions vaccines optimistic. Well actually wrong - we‚Äôre better vaccinations thought would, restrictions haven‚Äôt budged insane goalpost moving happening regarding cases. 

It‚Äôs becoming difficult think optimistically future like - many countries far less vaccination much less restrictions. problems mental health need restrictions end point get life back feel much better. It‚Äôs hard feel hope future UK. people bite nails compulsively. get it, almost certainly happening school even though government anticipates everyone access vaccine September. we‚Äôll vaccinated life hopefully back normal school still fucking online. That‚Äôs great dude, experience isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs. 

My years forcefully ripped away me, whereas option least. two weeks lol wait. Yea wave hits doesn‚Äôt anything stop it, appropriately criticized. vaccination campaign going well US, contributed it. DT too, don‚Äôt think many people criticized handling vaccine. it‚Äôs unfortunate timing actual change performance, look cases post Jan. 20th see clear downward trend, idk would expect Biden get criticism First shipment AstraZeneca came country past week. I'm front-line HCW, think gonna say chance? even hesitate. need start showing hospitalization severe disease rate vaccinated, rate infection, perhaps people see regard vaccines pretty darn similar effectiveness. soon(ish). Guy Calgary bought massive warehouse space vaccine production. clue long take anything least start. Thank you, needed said. part **nobody** seems discussing ([finally brought one TWiV clinical updates still know vaccines (especially less efficacious ones like J&amp;J AZ) prevent getting long covid. I.e. know people still get covid less efficacious vaccines might actually get sick **never get better.** think big, big deal. [That one hundred percent opposite reserve vaccine doses Trump admin claimed second doses turned exist. 

But nice try. Well depends clauses agreements going school. hard enforce, want actively discourage illegal immigrants getting vaccine, regardless legal status live country means want vaccinated reduce spread. way encourage requiring identification scaring getting vaccine. think could argue environmental protections way innovating solution. Forcing companies innovate become efficient less wasteful American pastime suggest that. recounted personal experience. No. argument ""boy Canada sure looks stupid claiming domestic capacity critical industries important."" talking nationalistic policies somehow promote exceptionalism.

What policy referring specifically right now? tendency put tribal groups ahead general welfare. 

Doesn‚Äôt groupings promote general welfare. Connecting/identifying among war

We wars due multitude social economic issues never good average sometimes benefits winner.

What declaring war Nazi Japanese WW2?

What Union going war confederacy end populism ugly sides society. 

They‚Äôre also positive sides society. Arguing nothing good comes ideologies show don‚Äôt actually know either are.

Populism policies benefit/supported majority population opposed elitism favor power.

Nationalism advocates well interest ones country. even sure complaint is. like broad misunderstanding know many people think good things. 

They definitely think unfortunate consequence evolved aggressive apes.

But new trains political/social ideology within past century. Excuse me?? Underperformed???? go work hospital Covid units 12 hours day, day day nearly year see do. every right feel express whatever frustrations feeling. However, somebody willingly squandered much college experience peak societal optimism (1st term Obama era) antisocial, introverted, work-obsessed hermit, happiness beyond college years feel immediately lost.

I get place understand may immediately want label out-of-touch boomer, hope give comment read year two see find different place. Healthcare workers took weekends holidays tens thousands died. That's rock-solid ***fact***. finish line, snapshot now.

No, snapshot September. completely false attributed - cases currently lowest rates since pandemic began. majority Swedish deaths Covid happened snapshot. Nice What's got posting 6 months old date article? Read [the Wiki article Bird long history many, many times group people infected weird new avian flu strain. never resulted human-to-human transmission date, there's reason think time.

I'm calling BS anyone, matter credentialed, says we're entering ""age pandemics"" wild new disease cause Covid 2: Electric Boogaloo within years. get climate change unpredictable effects, maybe true certain diseases become transmissible, seen hard evidence supposition. Honestly, whole ""Covid-19 spread far something something climate change"" argument strikes half-baked easy explanation. people casually suggest pandemic bad worse Covid inevitably coming lifetimes, even though worst one we've 100 years. makes sense. know certain actually primary metric. Hospitalizations lesser extent infections It‚Äôs gonna work get back school, provides net health benefit regardless debatable increase transmission.  Yes thats right coronaviruses mutate bit slower flu mean ""slow"". 

RNA viruses general mutate pretty quick compared viruses.

""Coronaviruses slightly lower mutation rate many RNA viruses light genetic proofreading. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs enough prevents mutations accumulating,‚Äù says virologist Louis Mansky, director Institute Molecular Virology University Minnesota. novel coronavirus ran amok around world, inevitable range variants would arise.

The true mutation rate virus difficult measure though. ‚ÄúMost mutations going lethal virus, you‚Äôll never see actively growing, evolving virus population,‚Äù Mansky Maybe they‚Äôre designed way? would think fire emergency want somebody able get out. Maybe glass breakable something believe survival 50 70 group still like 99 percent though. impossible due anti vaxxers alone. virus stay. Can‚Äôt sure receiving AstraZeneca time it‚Äôs due roll here, it‚Äôs used countries outbreaks data thats collected data isn‚Äôt strong enough support nationwide rollout may see rollout scramble doses Pfizer vaccine instead, causing delay herd immunity, makes initial roll even important start sort protection.

We need get phase 1 right best ability think better paced demonstrating now.

It‚Äôs really one big experiment lucky able collect sorts data countries time implement protective measures things got bad, time learn mistakes outbreaks, time assess data vaccines deciding take part.

Our protocol changed much early days adapted changes well enough still position relative normality compared countries.

By now, someone typically doesn‚Äôt trust others easily, especially authority positions, developed trust really assessing strategies time learning enough mistakes better.

Right now, Pfizer vaccine get one need address hesitancy with. von der Leyen resign. say hardcore European federalist someone seen last fifteen years failure different German ministries. little scene country:

March 2020: ""okay, need go lockdown. School's closed, starting tomorrow.""

April 2020: ""we really need get car dealerships open soccer national level back up.""

June 2020: ""we might start thinking get schools open, car dealerships everything else back six weeks...""

...

...

""oh, mitigate risk keeping air quality check? well, bad, can't re-open schools yet that'd mean repair windows. Let's set national fund buy air purifiers every classroom, may cheaper getting windows fixed."" Hybrid worst possible option. open, done 10 months ago. lot loonies think. I'm pro science pro vaccine, Rogan Elon Musk want vaccine either. 1% crystal healing crazies internet. would guess probable third country (the US) untrusting vaccines. think massive problem confronting yet. ones recovered better probably end elder care. friend icu several times, one infected gallbladder, one leukemia (almost died one), think earlier one pneumonia sure actually ICU one not. those, sent home, elder care. quite well now. recover fully gallbladder pneumonia ones. leukemia flat lined bit high dose chemo taken back bit still quite spry age. People two shots also 100% protected it‚Äôs kind questionable statement. CDC done plenty studies indicate much higher infection rate what‚Äôs captured testing. 

The conservative estimate I‚Äôve seen January 15, 83.1 million people infected.

It‚Äôs important hold elected officials accountable all. Yes part problem. ""Virus gone"" occurs *after* herd immunity. Herd immunity helps ensure virus cannot spread even normal human activity, enough uninfected hosts virus spread ties out. even obtained point, magically cure people already sick stop infecting people. means infection rate going trend zero.

As appear understand simple concept, suggest reading studying posting further. vaccine increase numbers stop transmission.

If number go know media fed bullshit No, headline garbage. needle jab that's issue, rather mentally convincing sick/better received medication biased reporting. everyone bias cancels out. highly doubt 55% population infected.  I‚Äôve seen thought process pushing idea don‚Äôt buy it.  obviously much higher caseload confirmed numbers one thing know attack rate 100% even within many households.  instance friend epicenter early super spreader event NY hardcore tracing on.  huge levels viral shedding (he infected 8 15 people group meeting 3 hours).

When consider 25%(ish) US population live alone attack rate Covid within household doesn‚Äôt seem 80% (I remember discussing twiv last summer). understand things military congregate care random populations come play.  think roughly speaking us 55% population Covid would mean way 50% households America would Covid. find highly unlikely.  

I think mostly associate people careful might seem like think family scattered across multiple states cases us congregate care. live areas huge waves taking serious beginning. areas huge incidences infection. doubt average street America 65% households it. yet. forget rising domestic violence, starvation, plus suicides. Sadly lost friend due lockdown. Good explanation!

I wasn‚Äôt suggesting said anything benefit, explaining CHO doesn‚Äôt weigh decision doctor trust 100% why.

I don‚Äôt know benefits truly be, one does, vaccine expected eradicate disease either, one vaccine history credited that, best anyone hoped similar vaccines, reduce risk make disease manageable control multiple fronts start mapping new normal.

Maybe I‚Äôm understanding you.

What don‚Äôt trust exactly?
The plan developed CHO, it‚Äôs plan that‚Äôs tweaked country country based specific risks predominantly follow similar model really can‚Äôt take credit much accept selling idea it, little outdated opinion aerosols.

And taking jab improve public confidence little opinion aerosols either. He‚Äôs gonna react vaccine way matter opinion. 
This addresses vaccine hesitancy based fear unkown, that‚Äôs point demonstration.
If someone trust takes jab change perceive results vaccine hesitant want see affects others first know prominent people arnt avoiding would raise suspicion?

I honestly don‚Äôt understand point, I‚Äôm dig, want understand.

I don‚Äôt trust anyone, even I‚Äôm medically scientifically trained.

With decision looming needed consider trust help decide, it‚Äôs CHO, don‚Äôt know him, he‚Äôs proven nothing except willing step forward take shot.

I‚Äôm fortunate practitioner highly regarded 38 years proven care belt. don‚Äôt think people that.

So trust? comment literally says ""99.9% people vaccinated"" false mean 2020 Ouch. Sometimes America's top-hat pay. Rest assured though, we're still screwed too, different ways. Might work little well. 

Do know happens someone gets half dozen COVID shots? ;) denying china authoritarian state currently committing genicide uighurs? I'm even live Australia honest, I'm North America. friends live think relative rest world response pretty impressive past months. feel like health officer screw he's refusing listen basic science (e.g. aerosol transmission) seem like he's needs done end pandemic.

Thank god government tell hug. let know stop using glory hole built? expiring. would like say seriously concerned ‚Äútotal vaccination‚Äù drive Israel included Palestinians-any Palestinians-I heard one report. one Gaza, Eastern bank area. me, upsetting-are people too. anyone heard going on? hear great Israel vaccinated everyone, it‚Äôs true, it? 69. hope would fate placed Gaza, rather Cleveland? Shhhhhhhhhhut Seek mental help. Living rest life fear healthy. Lessons took: reason optimistic, won‚Äôt last forever, need careful bit longer longer means summer 2021 2022, we‚Äôre actually going live life even it‚Äôs touch different (no, doesn‚Äôt mean universal mask wearing years), stay away main stream media. discouraging toxic uninformative media is. many time read vaccines still leave 5% higher chance getting sick. Well, that‚Äôs exactly numbers work goes every major outlet pumping fear. really.

US share measles outbreaks every year, certainly localized restrictions, closing schools, happens. ones Brooklyn, Seattle, Disneyland 2019 come mind.

But gets hand, get American Samoa, pretty much shut late 2019 measles. Maybe coincidence, experience may something outstanding COVID response (4 cases...total). many Asian countries leveraged SARS experience keep cases low.

Meanwhile, US, cases measles plummeted 1,282 2019 13 2020 none far 2021.

I‚Äôm suggesting people won‚Äôt go back pre-pandemic routines, may become less easy dismiss contagious disease unavoidable. Drives crazy many people ignore value good ventilation. Yeah, it‚Äôs gonna little colder one winter energy bills higher, it‚Äôs one easiest ways make indoor spaces safer pandemic.

So first all, agree good ventilation crucial decreasing SARS-CoV-2 concentrations air.

I want add *not cases* opening windows improves ventilation. useful scenarios get *cross-draught* (opposite sides room route outdoor air).

If get cross-draught, actually make ventilation worse opening window. see, happens lose underpressure room. turn leads air short-circuiting output vents. get pipes air flowing outside straight output vents, rest air room remains stagnant. However, retain underpressure, air circulates every nook cranny room.

Of course windows never *screwed* shut, dangerous emergency situations. That‚Äôs pretty smart. Whooping cough kill newborn. You‚Äôve given zero numbers, one ‚Äúsource‚Äù zero logic. one source explained basic immunity works. reason believe I‚Äôm working doctor. I‚Äôve earned five degrees besides doctorate. I‚Äôve practice 15 years. I‚Äôve seen 6000 individual patient appointments since March. I‚Äôm telling evidence herd immunity accomplished year. There‚Äôs even logical process. Combine fact 74+ million country 18, getting vaccinated, alarming number idiots willing get vaccinated throw factual numbers can‚Äôt avoid problem. We‚Äôll hit herd immunity next year we‚Äôre lucky. 

Luckily I‚Äôm beach house bored gave entertainment evening. find source antibodies population study showing inherent immunity let know, I‚Äôd love read it. That's probably attributable much northern hemisphere post-holiday, winter season -- human movement traffic (shopping general) always declines markedly (aside work) January March.

Less people = less people getting sick spreading (or stuff like flu normal years - flu season peaks late Jan/early Feb).

A lot big players southern hemi maintained strict mitigation rules (Aid, NZ) lot countries southern hemisphere can't really keep track virus first place much information inaccurate, despite countries best efforts.

Vaccines getting portion least immunity (due infected already), though that's unlikely 10-20% population total.

Numbers dropping we're beating it, yet. They're dropping cold af much first world, people going already usually time year, we're getting people vaccinated, lot people already sick. confluence several things. real indicator gonna go late March/April. That's tens millions Americans see tax returns, that's spring starts peek snow, on. everyone else vaccinated, matter spread someone else? They‚Äôre still likely covid mild covid worst. Way take one elderly. Incredibly noble you. even though studies suggest mean completely accurate yet? data needed telling people ""you got shot, life normal again, go wild"". cost? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

It won‚Äôt perfect.  risk vaccinated individual could still transit it. you‚Äôre talking herd immunity, really need work majority time.

If prevents 75% onward transmission, still works end (assuming high uptake eventual vaccination kids). takes time. it‚Äôs kind level, works population whole, vaccinated individuals still careful case counts drop locally. it‚Äôs different risk calculation it‚Äôs personal.  Herd immunity means outbreaks eventually die spreading far.  put family terms ‚Äúoh, don‚Äôt worry - it‚Äôll infect it‚Äôll stop spreading‚Äù, sounds entirely different right? Thanks story, yeah think never tested know sure.

It‚Äôs interesting arm didn‚Äôt hurt badly felt like gotten punched Muhammad Ali. almost cried putting shirt next morning. vaccine isn‚Äôt really risky young people, almost deaths hospitalizations coming old people. prevent deaths, wasn‚Äôt it?  good point Even better much needed relief hospital systems staff, probably great sign come terms death. happening, immunization increasing rapid levels.

The UK vaccine export ban, although [has looking introducing EU introduced mechanism block exports. I‚Äôm sorry read school shitter blank like increasing number people Japan taking imported COVID-19 drugs authorized use country, prompting public health officials issue warning taking effects unauthorized medicines may compensated government, health ministry woman 40s Shizuoka Prefecture among imported drugs. took ivermectin, antiparasitic drug produced Indian company approved treating COVID-19 ordered drug import agent research, including reading papers available U.S. Centers Disease Control bought thought take it, risk, prevent infection,‚Äù Kitasato Institute conducting clinical trial determine efficacy ivermectin treating several unauthorized medicines, including ivermectin, ordered people Japan protect coronavirus, import agent apparently use remdesivir dexamethasone, drugs approved Japanese regulators treat COVID-19, requires clients ordering medicine treat COVID-19 50s 60s, higher risk developing severe symptoms,‚Äù agent malaria drug touted former U.S. President Donald Trump treatment COVID-19, HIV treatment lopinavir previously popular among people looking treatment.

It‚Äôs extremely dangerous take one‚Äôs judgment,‚Äù said official ministry‚Äôs Tuberculosis Infectious Diseases Control Division. Anyone feeling positive lately worst behind us? 

Like, yeah cases long time come, things still shitty lot places lockdowns, restrictions, etc. mass vaccinations underway can‚Äôt see scenario going forward things deteriorate go backwards (barring new variant, think unlikely personally). 

It seems we‚Äôve like vaccinations gather steam, things get better here. wrong thinking we‚Äôre darkest days this?  Based data have, know. know sure article trying deceive readers. horror layman idiot like write corrections. Physical distancing one vaccine effect population blame Merkel. wanted von der Leyen helps local production block export vaccine like UK/ US

can please show evidence blocking exports? i've seen BULLSHIT. take hydroxychloroquine. still safe enough reopen according them. [CDC Says Schools Reopen Many domains give exact country code. UK made 4 countries majority time speaking England. ""if help"" means something ambiguous, specifically clear (for example .co.uk) read article. 

It's tip help, Gospel. help reason shared person. really know else want say you. And? horrible, biased scientifically wrong things posted come australian media. wonder zero infections can't get false negatives... British-Swedish company understanding. EU ultimately wants - federation states.

And - that's ass backwards. Shutting borders saved billions. silo infection is, conduct life normally isn't.

But nevermind, proceed were.. easy way hard way learn things. sass Dr Peter Hortez MD. can't tell us darkest months ahead, might go back TV. r/PhonesAreBad Agree much. I'm sure examples already exist allowing individual folk different freedoms based whether got vaccination feels like dangerous precedent set. Despite shit show UK government one things agree approach ‚Äî far drawn vaccine passports instead say we're going manage society whole vaccines rapid testing.

Obviously means shit need overseas stuff least means feel benefit vaccination together restrictions curved rather folk end list wait months longer go pub etc.  ways? healthcare Canada anything wonderful. lol, tall order give US. Hope pull though. Seems like people want freedom, nobody go test California.

Normally pro testing, Cali ridiculous here.  Another week goes without EU signing deal Novavax, even reported definitely getting done week. joke. KNOW help, walked away thinking referring UK. 'if help' bit tip make sense. comparing number cases trial group non-trial group.

If non-trial group 10000 people 100 people got virus died, trial group also 10000 people 1 died, effectiveness 99/100 = 99%. That‚Äôs means. Herd immunity never worked measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio.   
They went round round.     
Different diseases though. variants entire human population, 99.999% change thing Like said tip - help read article. might always clear. People anyways avoid taking away wrong conclusions - misleading titles place reddit. YES! right! Biden reason COVID disappearing! Thank G\*D BIDEN! hero!

You joke Imagine vaccine safe virus deadly bribed take get idea vaccines lower relative risk, since efficacy data like vaccine trials based one overall observed incidence, seems like false precision apply rates individual level. missing something? think people changed behavior significantly.

Mostly combination people getting vaccinated, fact many people already gotten it, virus can't reinfect (also can't passed them). post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The increasing selection pressure clearly antiviral immunity lockdown. China, USSR, modern America (e.g. Guantanamo) examples

imo, vaccine distributed worker level first worked outwards.

Well, we're still fundamentally disagreement, least quaff rest pints shake hands leaving pub.

It‚Äôs Europe. sure vaccinated anyone 80 70. lazy read articles, give summary please likely Covid spread food? hard surfaces? gotten OCD, can‚Äôt stop disinfecting stuff. nervous sad anxiety depression. Saying normal people suffer illnesses yearly trivializes serious are. million yet. Even age groups account 88% deaths vaccinated, still large amounts younger age groups high hospitalisation rates. 

Once over-60s done probably things planned re-opening already. over-50s done, won‚Äôt take long. Specifically UK though. Ah ok. That‚Äôs much better then. Still, immediately clear region article whether talking age group UK, whole world. Also, UK websites report news countries. Positive, day 10 10.

If keep borders shut long-term, many areas gonna hospital personnel food supermarkets, given (sometimes always) imported countries. Simple that. people keep repeating ""Australia"" anywhere near comparable situation Germany beyond me. true. caught Covid November. first started symptoms called GP schedule test. told me: ""No test you, runny nose indicated Covid, labs maximum capacity, test you"". waited. cold symptoms got worse, called national corona hotline, told thing ""You runny nose?

No scientist seriously considered possibility wouldn‚Äôt lower transmission all.  Quite likely vulnerable given yearly boosters along flu jab. would sufficient mitigate severe covid deaths avoid lockdowns Correct I‚Äôm wrong, herd immunity reached somewhere 70% threshold.

Maybe different part world though.

Where strict fuck that. windows something offset it. masks- unvaccinated pretend vaccinated get wearing masks. majority vaccinated , keep masks on. believe lifting restrictions vaccination plan Australia came devised vaccines completed trials. Australia put eggs many baskets. know Pfizer better efficacy AZ, prevent severe disease. I'm sure government's mind recently doubled order Pfizer vaccines.

Our program locked stone. present balance practicalities getting vaccine out. Pfizer must ordered overseas, comes supply problems, may suitable distribution rural remote communities. AZ produced Australia easier distribute. AZ better vaccinating 20-50% population year waiting vaccinate anyone else.

We need program perfect, need good enough prevent Covid overwhelming systems. second dose increasing evidence delaying ? Maybe someone, somewhere, 1984. mean new vaccine technology changed pandemic regarding it? it‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs literally unions for. can‚Äôt trust everything Union says fair fair Good. west would implement. Duuuude, relate lot wrote. know I'd quite call pre-covid social life ""fragile,"" clearly resilient enough keep feeling huge void 11 months this. Especially single guy living alone, things might matter much people (like actually seeing coworkers days) matter lot me. 

Not sure old are, I'm easing mid-30s. generally easy making close friends get older ""normal times,"" right COVID really trying put best settings meet people I'd likely share common values, etc., hopefully create deeper friendships/connections. really mindful wanting cultivate healthy sense community life. settings (book club, church activities, volunteer meetings, etc.) got taken away, feel like I'm scraping bottom barrel find in-person gathering hang people may much common anyway. incredibly demoralizing.

Anyway, feel free PM ever want chat commiserate. really hope decision makers realize this

Two schools eight daycare institutions central Jutland city Kolding remain closed Friday 26 following coronavirus outbreaks experts claim underline devastating potential British variant COVID-19.

At last count two schools total 69 infections among staff students, 20 infected daycare institutions. 

Something weird kids

The data there. 
The studies out. 
The government ignored them. 

So China sent tanks, troops quarantained 20 million people, Germany believed virus could contained easily. believed China wanted demonstrate military prowess Chinese casualties resulted China's outdated equipment poor health care system. believed virus problem. lived r√™cnt Ebola scare manufactured millions unused Ebola vaccines, German government thought virus would go away. wrong.

But understand Germany failed miserably, let's first take look heading health ministry. German health minister Jens Spahn, educated banking (true) brought industry lobbyists weaken national healthcare system. Every single pre-covid interview Spahn trying profile absolutely nothing ridiculing doctors healthcare personel. redeeming feature short term, hopefully end Merkel's term.

It happened covid19 hit Europe, Germany employed one incompetent health minister history. Jens Spahn John Snow health. knows nothing. called covid19 mild flu television. warn nation virus prepared supply logistics prepare influx patients, 4 months absolutely nothing, ridiculed virus. even issued nation wide media campaign calling people warning virus conspiracy theorists nutters. backfired greatly 2 months later went full back throttle half population refused quarataine.

He wasted 4 months nothing media campaigns giving interviews. Covid hit Germany, refused cancel German Carneval festival 100,000 people attending. asked cancel, responded want appear alarmists. day later called media police find Carneval attendees get tested. week later refused cancel Bundesliga game tens thousands viewers 10km covid outbreak. Guess town developed covid clusterfuck? Yep!

It chancelor Merkel got frustrated Spahn's performance called leading Chinese doctors hear experiences first hand. video conference Germany immediately issued preparations go full lockdown. Sadly, half population told months doubt virus even existed. doubting did. took massive media campaign daily briefings months deprogram population make care disease.


Bonus story: Germany's mask fiasco

Not Jens Spahn fail understand danger disease. fucked sending almost n95 masks oxygen equipment humanitarian aid China 2 weeks prior thr large covid outbreak Germany. Doctors, nurses, nobody masks form protective gear. doctor friend mine literally worked epi center outbreak. said thing given green surgery masks. took 3 months 11 billion Euro finally get n95 German hospitals. Scalpers bought masks German governmrnt bought 18 dollar piece,  whopping 2000% markup. Luckily Germany rich. that's all. German Bundeswehr ordered secure strategic ppe stocks scammed African salesman. got swindled 200 million euro (? Can't remember exact figure). seeing absolute incompetence German federal government, local Bavarian government organized task force secure millions masks China, stolen bandits stored unlocked(!) storage rooms. That's really interesting, clearly missing that. Thanks filling in. :) give confirmation folks age seen important vaccines are, chicken pox, measles, polio.... That‚Äôs great point! Actually specific lab, biggest issue running time. there, patients treating could choose chemotherapy experimental immunotherapy vaccines. biggest issue immunotherapy vaccines length time took synthesize effective vaccine - estimated vaccine would take around THREE months create, start finish. you‚Äôre treating terminal cancer patients...that‚Äôs pretty rough timeline. RNA vaccines wonderful creation I‚Äôm really looking forward seeing impacts immunotherapy. That‚Äôs remember polio. Hopefully two dose efficacy closer mRNA ones are! Fingers crossed! No, mean like real one US still perpetrating first people's Yeah Israel using Pfizer vaccines. UK still using AZ much lower efficacy, especially among seniors. saw PM receiving jab TV. Bit weird putting ahead rest Australia, wouldn‚Äôt expect less prick. 

I understand wanting shut dangerous anti-vaxx brigade though. 

But time, it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúLook me! Receiving lovely Pfizer vaccine ahead everyone. rest Australians AstraZeneva jab, less effectiveness, even paused countries‚Äù Yes. stay home, fully isolated protected. likelihood, unions aren‚Äôt going agree back inschool sessions, even access vaccines. goalpost move. mean like ongoing genocide uighurs China? never understand. Reddit basement dwellers going fight possible return normal much can. like situation don‚Äôt really care affects people. IIRC, late March time frame. However know it'd require full waiting period FDA submission approval process. less misleading title: vaccinated family members safe hug VACCINATED family members. take working vaccine AZ though? isnt article about. read saying two family members vaccinated much lax health measures, HOWEVER vaccinated person drop safety measures public 10% population vaccinated. 

He isnt speaking long term behaviors talking currently. Okay new account absolutely comical clarify - I‚Äôm school that‚Äôs already person (with online option kids want it, half students, teachers campus) teachers aren‚Äôt getting vaccines yet. kids pretty good masks, think work (although wish required quality masks - kids wear one layer gaiters). school, one teachers‚Äô big concerns lunch. can‚Äôt tell kids eat day, don‚Äôt enough space keep six feet apart eating. least one school state already confirmed cluster cases tied lunchtime. try encourage eat quickly put masks back on, also don‚Äôt want stress rush end sick stomachs, decide skip eating.

I agree shouldn‚Äôt keep schools closed forever one group parents, also think disadvantaged kids used lot example kids hurt closures, people need realize opening schools ASAP safety precautions help kids. Improvements ventilation, spacing, safety measures would reassure parents make feel safe kids returning addition reassuring teachers.

I would hundred percent favor getting rid standardized measures, least flag areas help kid, using punitive way. narrow, restrictive way evaluate kids miss much given student‚Äôs unique strengths, even normal year. Yes, responded person said hop right classroom right want teach. teaching we‚Äôre making it. Dunno else want us. 

When conversation ends im gonna hop zoom give best kiddos like since last March. You‚Äôll continue post threads like saying fuck teachers fuck teacher unions. point carrying lol Fair enough suppose Get public eye ASAP. insufferable. feel like none shit necessary world views says don‚Äôt real control anything. Thank you.  roommates got covid back December. spent two weeks quarantining them, really trying distance all, never actually contracted covid myself.

Some people hyper resistant apparently Sire it'll take full herd immunity isnt like flip switch like dimming switch, spread get less less get closer point. vaccinate people likely get COVID though, could massively reduce chances older people ever exposed begin with, save lives whilst also reducing probability mutations long-haulers. I‚Äôm baffled anyone could come conclusion. Many (most possibly?) states vaccinating teachers weeks.  Also, unrelated this, protein folding problem got solved. RNA vaccines easy, safe, convenient way make body manufacture protein. I‚Äôm going rent place Arizona case. parents 65 appointment March 17.

Same! kids don‚Äôt need lose another parent! right get vaccinated. dunno, handled well Oregon. Feeling pretty good level lock implemented effectiveness -- lowest state case wise whole time. personally think hard lock approach necessary. helped clearly enforced mask mandate, closing high risk things quickly -- crowded bars, large events, etc. became apparent effective masks controlling spread, think negated need strict ""don't leave house"" type lock downs. I've outdoor dining since summer, feel fine it. Thanks heads up. trying figure hell talking about. guessing, probably vaccinated + people got recovered Yes, enough vaccinated yet. great call. studies support time goes on. Makes wonder world rushed condemn UK approach made lot sense face it, science proving well. guess UK's higher public vaccine willingness gave room go ""off-road"", even reasonable way, explain everyone rushed shit it. Mortality unclear, possibly increased. overall deaths increased even mortality unchanged due increased transmission. think waiting see beat variants current vaccine rollout strategy also gamble.

I heard vaccine manufacturers (e.g. Moderna, Pfizer others) working booster variants. LOL. That‚Äôs ridiculous. ‚Äúchecking temperatures‚Äù too, girl literally boom-boom-boom beeped thermometer wrists (apparently that‚Äôs thing now?) without even looking üòÇ Almost 4%! irresponsible downright rather horrible support indoor dining restaurant employees still can't vaccinated. 

They're people too, deserve exposed virus. can't choose work, need housing food. 

It's classist nasty say deserve go restaurants employees restaurants deserve safe. 

I think continue takeout (and tip well it, able) vaccinated well. also wear seatbelts go doctor feeling ill. You‚Äôre misunderstanding religion. clearly read article. parents 71 haven‚Äôt theirs. Kansas, I‚Äôve known people coworkers 40s 50s gotten theirs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Downvoted, correct Well, half sub thinks 2 weeks forever UK It‚Äôs implied scientific data. Vaccines 90+% effectiveness rate? essentially eliminate risk death? vaccine fine hug. data, there‚Äôs zero reason headlines like need exist. Take facts make informed decision. 

You‚Äôre going determine risk tolerance eventually. Fauci isn‚Äôt going explicitly say whether every little thing perfectly safe. know that, right? Use brain. Yes, people extremely imbalanced risk aversion thought processes. Great news UK!

In Canada, two thirds 65-69 year olds still waiting vaccine. third still waiting too. They're still made developed America (in addition Germany, etc) subsidized govt (at least moderna). Nothing stopping Canadian companies making lol. also diverse population wide range physical reactions virus. People kidding think poses big risk mutations. Genetic variability population matters. I‚Äôm NY. 7-day positivity rate ~4%. powerblock dumbbells peloton, I‚Äôm really starting miss gym, especially looking like summer gonna pretty much normal.

Living home mom now. got first vaccine shot last week. Would safe go back gym soon? stay home gets second shot? 

I‚Äôd rather get sick, I‚Äôm much concerned much bringing someone home her. Maybe good idea, plans would formalized like, yesterday. Classes already schedules planned semester, need time they're gonna change them. Yes, also lose sight holding in-person education hostage... would've possibly sympathy, there's much evidence in-person education high risk activity safety protocols implemented. going fuel recall effort, ironically cause I'm fairly certain Newsom caved political points. That‚Äôs sad. Maybe first time considered ""natural"" herd immunity might exist. Though think vaccines push farther, maybe lasting. see. Travel gives much greater risk mutations spreading, rate travel within US concern. Furthermore, US much diverse population many countries checking. variable genetic population opens possibilities wider range mutations Yeah, take precautions everything. don‚Äôt want us catch spread but.... I‚Äôm still worried 2 year old running street facing serious consequences Covid. think teaching students? ROFL, ok. got source? source all? Nope cause isn‚Äôt one. Nice paid 100m doses front though threatening fire people get vaccinated comes play. Good god...lets hope vaccines ramp production get vaccines out. That's focusing gave post upvote. necessarily agree 100%, actual important current issues California. reference, I'm left leaning independent Californian.

Jesus may central tenant Christianity, apparently imprisoning *some* scientists invalidate country's belief scientific method. need review scientific method? implying demonized authoritarian countries, believe testing hypotheses lmao.  


THere many countries 'freedom religion', frequent afflictions it. Take India example....Does imply country anti-freedom religion...? Obviously not.  


There guaranteed freedom speech clauses first amendment US constitution. Many feel recent 'cancel culture', americans longer 'freedom speech'. Therefore say current American culture 'anti-freedom speech'? 


Again, 100% something mean anti thing. Shot shot? Cases starting around world January 2020... laugh that's exactly happen. I've screaming since day one. China country handled properly. I‚Äôve given handshake literally one person like year, awesome dude worked past fall internship. weird sounds, miss shaking people‚Äôs hands lot. It‚Äôs simple, binary. one made central decision access vaccine when. state guidelines, include teachers don‚Äôt. 

Let‚Äôs freak pretend decision hasn‚Äôt already made quite states. husband it, got tested put towards count. wonder many others someone household get everyone tested. sub: Politicians know what's best you!

Also sub: Wait politicians! Yeah, except active pandemic chances little higher. Whats delay??? see absolute win! You‚Äôre smart. didn‚Äôt clarify. :) can't get disease without infection, get infection without disease.

You know probiotics, right? give infection. infect gut, make work better. get disease though, right? bacterial disease symptoms?

There ""parasites"" thing, much people purposefully infecting themselves, calling ""helminthic therapy"" almost without ""disease"". Like symptoms, hundreds tiny parasites guts. 

There viruses included probiotics, bacteria. Again, disease, yes infection. There's Handelsblatt article saying 8% effective over-65s, assertion totally consistent data. We‚Äôre way behind Arkansas, then. Still priority 70+ only. 66-yr-old Mom COPD can‚Äôt get reservation, even.

I'd rather Pfizer focus producing much thier existing vaccine fast possibly can. plenty time speculation get stuck. good news GB. bad numbers gonna look different US...  Sure. nearly everyone wore masks. Outside masks fine. That‚Äôs point. Places go overkill letting anyone go socialize outside masks creating unnecessary psychological toll little additional effectiveness containing spread. Portland particular great mask use beginning. Closing gyms, bars, large events etc impactful enough worth doing. opened indoor dining awhile summer closed cases started spiking. starting open indoor dining again. I‚Äôm still sticking outdoor, think Oregon done good job finding middle ground lockdowns effective heavy handed causes harm needed. Speaking Disney, I'm gonna bet they'll try keeping restrictions place much longer actually necessary.  really want risk prolong pandemic? better give people booster shot least Pfizer another study effectiveness humans? thanks this. one hand i‚Äôm mystified people came city without calling first since it‚Äôs news days vaccine shipments held up. hand, communications many vaccine sites hotlines terrible, it‚Äôs possible people calling couldn‚Äôt get through. going pandemics future, ""pandemic"" automatically mean ""everyone completely gives life year"".

Try telling local government that, though.

Am paranoid, leaders seriously thinking permanent rolling lockdowns? (Mostly Europe, US) worry! Canada still beating nearly every single developing nation terms vaccination rate! Morocco, Serbia couple low middle income countries beating us worst case! Also procurement minister assures still beating Australia, country covid death months! 

Jokes aside.... I'm still hopeful we'll ramp Trudeau basically try everythingthing speed vaccination rates considering next federal election basically referendum covid response. I‚Äôm sorry, thought opening schools expense killing old people wasn‚Äôt wanted do? change exactly? let teachers skip line vaccines that‚Äôs EXACTLY you‚Äôre doing. Jfc American media truly insane. [Criticizing vaccinating at-risk thought covid entire year, turned really bored. Thank god. I‚Äôve waiting Fauci give permission hug mom. kind soul! Excess deaths much better European countries though. zero faith Australia's vaccination plan. Deputy Chief Medical Officer still [refuses accept fact Covid infects people aerosols listen Australian  chance killing you‚Äôll chance killing pandemic would nice could say April, latest news J&amp;J's vaccine probably widely available May June, I'm going temper expectations little. like TSA, show make people feel safe even barely anything. Don‚Äôt act like skiing safe thing.

Going slopes safe. shit around proven source infections.

Lots infections. source says plan need be. good look like need to.

""While blood serum samples produced less neutralizing antibody activity, still enough neutralize virus, wrote letter journal. line studies. well within seen viruses, one researchers see much silver lining though:

""The viruses change quickly herd immunity develop permanently population."" Yes part problem. ""Virus gone"" occurs herd immunity

You're awfully condescending someone absolutely, objectively wrong simple fact.

The virus go away NPIs without herd immunity. also go away herd immunity.

And think people understand colloquially ""virus gone"" mean literally eradicated. means reduced negligible threat levels. Personally think study that. thing two dose thing adequately studied trials real world results consistent. trials studied 6 months. one shot studies started barely month ago results consistent. Also, [manufacturer strongly advised know works follow that. Nah.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

One theory I've seen body's reaction length day, since peak seemed 2 weeks winter solstice many northern hemisphere countries. body react strongly days getting longer minutes? know best theory I've seen. places little measures also dropping (some US states example).

I realize it‚Äôs highly probable FDA approves general use, far see zero reasons wouldn‚Äôt. still feel longer review necessary businesses start making part work requirements considering job market sectors economy quitting almost isn‚Äôt choice.

Regardless kinda minor point arguing over, FDA likely going approve fully soon. Bay Area even half 75+ year olds vaccinated lol. CA teacher here, fully agree. would egregious jump line vaccine refuse open up. Sadly, wouldn‚Äôt surprise slightest. personally know Covid-skeptical teachers travelled last year reluctant go back. teachers undoubtedly working butts last school year. totally coasting working 7:30 11:00 pajamas. free health care still wonderful. 

The issue vaccines don‚Äôt resources place manufacture vaccine (and won‚Äôt 2022), entirely dependent government sourcing us. Delays (production) Pfizer Moderna cut ‚Äúguaranteed shipments‚Äù drastically. 

That‚Äôs failure federal level. 

When comes vaccines have, distribution absolute shitshow. 

While money comes feds, healthcare provincial (state) responsibility. Especially Ontario, it‚Äôs debacle. Constant lockdowns reopenings, real structure organization vaccine rollout, fudging numbers‚Ä¶ list goes on. 

That‚Äôs failure provincial level. 

The REAL embarrassing part cut funding programs would help discover/treat/manufacture vaccines‚Ä¶ despite hit pretty badly SARS 2003 (a 4 month, two stage outbreak).

Given terribly handled, consternation Canadians risen dramatically towards politicians, it‚Äôs actually begun effect standings voter polls. It‚Äôs party specific, either, left-centre (liberals - federal level) right wing (conservatives - provincial level) getting HAMMERED this. 

I hope learn comedy errors something magnitude happens again. Gee, freaking think? Believe me, average person US chance getting vaccinated anytime soon. still know plenty 65+ people stuck vaccine limbo. COVID, course illness similar mine resulted ""strange"" side effects took 7-8 months fully resolve. caught Dec year lmao. Fully masked N100 gloved went out, ever rarely. super contagious difficult avoid area large community spread. I'm mostly good I'm seems autoimmune arthritis seems relapse little bit stress body all. I've read people COVID eventually going away I'm hoping thats case. It‚Äôs acceleration public timetable. UK, they‚Äôre great vaccinations.

Why Bloomburg vaccine tracker say .9% pop 2nd dose. Seems like giving one dose. sure great doing. understand wanting guinea pig COVID vaccines. sign part trials. Pfizer/Mederna vaccines injected 50 million people. watched like hawk. CDC FDA made shit ton data available. sure medication taken life tested well. correct. Experts saying SARS-CoV-2 transmissible surface contact now, they? found many (if cases) could directly link it. Obviously rule out, mean probably rather infrequent. take 8 shots. think main argument ""natural herd immunity"" via letting COVID run rampant would cause massive amounts deaths / disabilities ... eventually work. yup ... sitting 500K dead. 200K WWII. Numbers increasing now, expect lockdown get extended 1) line usually pretty spread people dragging showboards behind them.

2) usually party lift.

3) lodges/bathrooms different building open? Also people spend small percentage time ski resort lodge. Get dude. ‚Äútested positive‚Äù months ago symptoms whatsoever. hey neighbor. Yea wtf extras excess waiting line? think chrisdub84's point still stands, though. know COVID high dispersion factor: small fraction people responsible large fraction case spread. suggests linear estimate (i.e. multiplying average values together) could significant amount.  


That said, recent evidence suggests elderly might high risk spreading disease well, vaccinating elderly could double-whammy - inoculate vulnerable likely cause lots transmission. read comments epidemiologists saying toss vaccinating old people vaccinating people 20's. rates infection much higher people 30 people 65. Cool story bro. Science research trump opinion one person trust simply you‚Äôve known long time. Don‚Äôt ask him, read research yourself. absolutely ridiculous expectations zero transmission return things normal. wishing something never never be. 

The new normal living risk this, *literally every disease existence*. tradeoffs, everything else - one thing clear, compliance indefinite people start ignoring mandates increasing regularity, right now. Therefore, public health officials waste time ineffective unnecessary restrictions fully vaccinated people peril. *imperative* waste public good placing unrealistic expectations return normalcy.

Probably mostly go away mostly stay away summer seasonality plus much population immunity Guess last third. Oh, yeah, I'm Texas. idea talking about.

Proving worked crucial thing. it? seen latest CDC reports estimated cases? 


It's insane. literally opinion every single expert field. Exactly. Vaccine supply limited already don‚Äôt see point vaccinating teachers they‚Äôre going continue work home stay Zoom. vaccine could go someone else who‚Äôs actually going work coming contact others. also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair students either, teacher wishes stay home vaccinated selfish. want teach online bad, find online teaching job. neglected toe hygiene, need addressed. someone knows nothing vaccine science, I'm surprised test temperatures trials. Like, course would highly beneficial find store warmer temps. random bonus benefit, massive part ability deliver really bad? wow study mentioned shows vaccine prevent infection large degree dropped 16% last week. 18% week that. 13.7% week that. 


If keeps dropping 15% per week, US would reach lowest hospitalization pandemic March 22. exactly one suck fuck? Add news Pfizer's vaccine necessarily need ultra cold storage, vaccinations continue ramp up. Yeah still cases, what's point? I‚Äôm thinking violation rules. headline said ""less 1% declined vaccine"". also thought ""less 1% decline"" ""the vaccine responsible less 1% decline new cases. vaccine work!"" would love source Apologies. thought person replied to. single fucking vaccine Israel produced Europe. California shots administered RNs LVNs. staffing companies sending nurses sites like these, well big ‚Äúsuper sites‚Äù give shots. It‚Äôs people giving shots, RNs like wife, who‚Äôs regular job labor &amp; deliver nurse major hospital. probably easiest job they‚Äôve ever had. There's evidence do. know works get shit pandemic. risk finally end shit? We've fucked dragged enough. Haven‚Äôt hit herd immunity now? thing spreads much say would think close least. I'm blaming anti vaxxers one.

Getting zero-anything near impossiblity. Zero-polio still happened yet. literally never said that. simply corrected incorrect statement measles eradicated. Canadian, one hurt. 

I‚Äôm gonna kick next person says ‚Äòsecured vaccines‚Äô nuts though. Yeah customers average supermarket. Even one-way signs, oblivious distancing. Many even know wear mask. causes, can‚Äôt wait see happens next. game changer vaccines? see approached used viruses? There's evidence people one dose *don't* adequate long term protection, either. much free speech. IFR IHR COVID higher measles long term effects COVID likely worse. Long-COVID widespread least malignant form long-term side effect COVID. long term effects hospitalized COVID severe COVID much worse.

This need compare long-term effects far. Let‚Äôs hope actually works. covid 100% haven‚Äôt got reinfected. Maybe rename site Didntreadit. US, 13% population recieved vaccine Whole world, U.S. Unless U.S. plans sealing borders forever achieves 0 cases. 7 days. still isolate wear mask. ignorant manipulation data reporting. outrageous. teachers get right get vaccinated get back class.

imagine demanding treated like essential worker refuse show work. imagine grocery workers doctors refused show said nah i'll work home. Saying open everything Covid aren‚Äôt locked measles comparison made. 

Measles causes zero deaths United States. country talking about. hey can‚Äôt win argument sure try move goalposts. Yeah that‚Äôs probably best. I‚Äôm certain she‚Äôs vaccinated I‚Äôll feel lot better. Plus, numbers even lower Agreed :) ngl found headline hilarious. ok maybe appropriate reaction, thought someone relying fauci tell could hug family hilarious.

come guys, fauci pretty good scientist who's right significant amount time. he's jesus. hope trained. Thank taking time write east understand language! disease infects affects elderly, much groups, exclude basis safety utter BS; especially since already phase 1 trials completed demonstrated safety profile vaccine. 

Go spin crap elsewhere. Oxford simply screwed up. one many errors made clinical trial. university experience running large, multi-national clinical trials never put charge covid vaccine trial. Hence lack consistently placebo clinical trial set ups, dosing errors, poor recruitment diverse trial participants, lack communication participants regards errors, FDA caught guard Oxford pulled application last minute, screwed data reporting, etc... I'm native CA resident see conservatives always railing CA like *worst* place world. perfect terrible conservatives believe. 

1. CA's poverty rates middle. highest poverty rates states like Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, etc
2. Taxes actually suppressed thanks Prop 13. mind paying higher taxes means better schools, people work poverty wages, roads get fixed etc. comes political values taxes objective measures ""bad"" ""good."" I'd rather live CA higher taxes Alabama lower taxes personal preference.
3. Corrupt politicians exist every state. worked City LA SF several years, including major politicians. corrupt, many truly worked hard constituents. think true whether CA TX. 
4. concede unemployment right pre-pandemic 3%. think fair criticize Gavin strict tier system shutting businesses. like place garbage. SF Bay Area's economy still one strongest world. T**he SF metropolitan area** alone economic power/GDP richest ***countries*** world. 
5. **Declining population good thing CA actually.** many people moved CA 2010s. soon tech companies left 2020 (with still plenty including website Reddit) people worked remotely, rent become actually affordable! better CA jobs concentrated one place. great see tech also cities like Austin, Denver, etc.
6. Homelessness fair criticism. CA huge number high paying jobs concentrated one place also strong culture NIMBYs wan't new housing built, results supply demand problem. democrats/republicans sides issue. high priority getting highly effective vaccine door. god many times said post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Measles eradicated. simple fact. lie people. Paywall Great Question!

In honesty - controversial. Traditional thought chemotherapies lower immune responses - due impacts white blood cells. know chemotherapies developed order work immunotherapies, seen currently use human trials (those known combination therapies - combining different therapies once). mice models atm, promising results.

The current immunotherapies see tested usually used either last-ditch effort. example - either may used straight bat experimental cohort, standards care treatments failed. personal example patient saw, first went radiation treatment, chemotherapy, failed, put experimental immunotherapy. alternative would start bat experimental immunotherapy, many patients reluctant standard care (which completely understandable). 

Generally - also comes IRB requirements (Institutional review boards). Human studies highly regulated - immunotherapies extremely recent (around last 10-20 years). want study effect immunotherapies first proceed attempt combination therapies. result, currently combining chemotherapy immunotherapy - we're generally trying see immunotherapy effective first proceed next step combination chemotherapy. Hopefully, years, establish efficacy immunotherapy, becomes standard care, combine chemotherapy. Deaths per million still higher Florida. Also cases plummeting faster Florida.

For Sweden better worst countries, last looked 5-10 higher nearest neighbors imposed lockdowns. conditional purchase contract contingent vaccine passing FDA approval. physically control vaccines right now. since FDA rejected yet, would premature cancel contract Employees? company something? lockdowns substantial plan help people deal lockdowns. Monthly stimulus payments, national mental health hotlines, robust support businesses, nationwide adherence. could chosen things, ""flatten curve"", keep people best shape possible throughout. never that. decide someone vaccinated life. Wait turn shut up. Please tell joke. Good talk. whats total immunity? Right, note record moron vacination? want trotted evidence makes dumb. fancy ""smart"" kept going ""show evidence! exist!""

I feel like scientism fallacy. idea assume something 100% false double blind study shows true old farts academia die off. lot things probabilistic. probability true not, true varies. throw asymmetry consequences right wrong. seriously people planet need ‚Äúguidance‚Äù whether hug family members? much reasoning behind idea immunity fade quickly spread second dose another month so. I'm suggesting away second dose altogether. one clear benefit spreading overall immunity likely last longer spread (that's works many vaccines least)

There lot information weigh know anyone say sure best option. true lower immunity 1 shot (although may slightly lower) could provide selective pressure mutations, hand, vaccinating tens millions people quicker, could spreading 2 doses, giving way opportunities infect people potentially mutate well since less people protected overall I'm arguing restrictions, I'm arguing best good outcome situation, one outcome worse other.

This decision needs politically costly, like politicians felt cost decisions far.

I think controversial statement say Lockdowns objectively bad took massive amount un-American restrictions get covid are. celebrated, rewarded. seen required evil happen keep people alive.....we politicians campaigning amount restrictions states have....dont think that's big slap face constituents forced poverty?

And I'm one side thing here, I'm saying thing politicians campaigning open state is, that's slap face people lost loved ones covid. change rule call recall ever considered you‚Äôre bad telling jokes? Surely US stockpile AZ names on? funded hugely crazy random seems sometimes.

I read story woman contracting getting maskless haircut front open window, meanwhile, nephew contracted everyone else household (wife, in-laws) tested negative. title wrong. Illness due covid dropped 95.8%, check asymtomatic infections. guess nullified might wrong word, practical sense still holds. UK secured 450 million doses joined scheme, UK would immediately lost 380 million doses. 

Independant contracts allowed part scheme. like Independant trade deals EU countries allowed EU. There's definitely merit argument, doubt. big question unknown variables, much population confirmed cases, 3x, 4x, 5x multiplier? there's double-tapping, got COVID, survived, got immunity, getting shot (or two), depending healthcare recommendations. definitely done, yes, short-term impact conferring additional immunity onto people least level immunity systems.

I think it'll blend two extremes, probably say 9 months, like people expecting, doubt it'll 1 month either. meet middle around 5 months, around July, that's I'm betting things returning normal. natural immunity, widespread vaccination, warmer weather, etc., Ro plummet crash, get back life. wouldn‚Äôt.

If everyone going life normal life soon vaccinated plenty data future one way other.  


1st possibility: Everything fine ever.

2nd possibilty: next wave covid escape mutation strain evolved people need new vaccination.

3rd possibility: next wave covid due escape mutation much less deadly immune system already knows another variant vaccination adapt quickly. Although might still relatively severe disease cases.

We see. American testing highest world CDC still thinks detect infections. Countries like France regularly report 30% positivity rates, absurd think we've picked even half existing cases globally, maybe less fifth even less that. It'll long time accurately estimate number infections, guarantee United States, 5% population, making 40% current infections. talk fine lots people without masks, simply remotely. Talking Zoom different talking face face regard. really hard say best route is.

Instead lockdowns people given advice socialize safely. IMHE horrible predictions day 1 still do. people still follow them? haven‚Äôt predicted anything correctly, ever. does. People keep treating transmission sort zero-sum game really bizarre.

Here's hypothetical: vaccinated people 10% chance transmission compared 80% chance transmission, would rather hug?

Furthermore, we're talking vaccinated people hugging vaccinated people, let's say rate transmitting COVID less 5%. scenario, yes, people going hug damn well should.

Wow entire world??? increase daily low temperature == warmer weather \*laughs Czech\*  Trump always antagonist. automatically side anyone talks shit on, knee jerk reactions all. Welcome Costco; love you. 

*jabs shot* good news. on, might expect hospitalizations/deaths continue fall, even infections 

Hospitalizations deaths already plunging vaccine rollout. primary child care providers mostly grandparents USA vaccinated? Maybe? teachers spouses vaccinated? Probably not, younger parents children vaccinated? Definitely not. 

So kids spread folks, teachers. Also, ~10,000 die nationally based existing mortality data(0.02%). Hopefully one care about, worth risk, yeah? G'day mate Cases already plummeted though. Ironically we're getting vaccines time herd immunity seems reached. youre healthcare provider fine. Great news. worry new hotel quarantine. bad!  Low numbers indicate herd immunity. e.g. UK low numbers twice past year. indicates sustained lockdown works.

It's increase percentage reduction numbers. UK consistent 25-ish% reduction per week. last 3 days death rate reduction climbed 25% 28%. might ICU care improving total number patients decreases. Herd immunity would preceded steadily increasing reduction% better 50% per week. numbers. No, I'm aware that. idea gives pass go around people flies face every epidemiological standard known man.

There reason symptomatic person suspects covid around people, suggest otherwise irresponsible.

If positive test result, would recommend go public long outside? Oxford gone directly trials young, healthy group full rollout vulnerable groups.

Surely concerned potential impacts elderly, would delayed Phase 3 trials rather skipping entirely? ‚ÄúMay‚Äù, ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù, etc matter me. still wipe *everything* disinfectant wipes get curbside delivery groceries. takeout get meet criteria able transfer oven 15 minutes 225F kill viruses (so cold stuff like sushi, salad, cold desserts, etc). high risk even though 'officials' say conclusive evidence, need chances contracting COVID close possible 0%. worked past year, continue feel comfortable enough to. Yep, single important thing right honest. prevents infection bag. prevents symptoms.. Well let's say leaky vaccine scary rabbit hole go down. I'm New York State Dept Health started frontline healthcare essential workers, well elderly. Recently opened groups like comorbidities.

It seem vary wildly locale though. Classic pro-lockdowner strawman: mocking human need social contact public spaces reducing uncool chain restaurants like ‚ÄúCheesecake Factory‚Äù. AZ vaccine doses recommended spaced 12 weeks apart. less 12 weeks since mass vaccinations really started.

The UK taken decision also space Pfizer doses similarly order give many people possible decent level protection (the second dose ups protection around 90% around 95%). decision drew flak time Pfizer trialled dosing regimen subsequent data seems indicate fine. written epidemiologist. lot psychology behind that, malice people gleaful bad news. brain reacts way stronger negative news good news, human biology. good enough animal models test mode transmission. idea done type testing. usually money. US wife got first vaccine know got second dosis. someone else position? Everyone know died got family member friend. died horrible death. visit. One days vaccine. 

But internet guy says I‚Äôm fun guess made wrong choices. Young people, particularly children highest vectors spread. number obvious reasons like impulse control self awareness, also less obvious reasons like much likely completely asymptomatic still infectious.


Older folks generally much aware risks virus presumably taking precautions avoid unnecessary exposure. nonsense, really.

We talking freedom movement political construct. matter political construct is. matters is, freedom movement within EU vital (literally vital) countries keep sort economy.

Having one island one part country 5% vaccinated part 23% bizarre painful. I‚Äôm riddled jealousy. Especially hearing they‚Äôll adults vaccinated July we‚Äôre aiming 70% September. care summer, many personal reasons, us lagging year behind massive thing.

I‚Äôm hoping either sell us extra vaccines even might able drive Belfast buy vaccine stage Sometimes take person‚Äôs body time heal infectious period over, whether it‚Äôs cold, flu, covid. Hydrate, rest, take care yourself. course, you‚Äôre worried, wouldn‚Äôt hurt televisit provider. plenty people vulnerable groups able get vaccine whatever reason (immunocompromised, allergic, etc etc).

Having big chunk population running round happy little disease vectors directly impacts them. Okay kind look overall trend jumping conclusions. one 80% Neanderthal DNA them. fact, average European Asian populations 1-2%. least say true. That‚Äôs likely due vaccines yet point. Especially decent percentage non-immune people staying home taking precautions go public. functioning government? again,

The supranational organisation government member fucked flailing around looking convenient scapegoats weeks.

Stop falling it. Labeling people cautious variants ""freaks WANT continue forever"", makes want put head thru wall. love good coronavirus news means less less people suffering / dying. absolutely Hate pandemic, HATE masks HATE lockdowns, LOVE we're downward trend, im treating hype right way treat huge video game releases, cautiously optimistic. variants definitely cause concern.

And evidence mounting perfectly fine Pfizer too. soon steadily increase last 2 3 days cases compared last week completely lifted then. Severely less restrictive imagine though. yeah exactly correct... results outstanding lot selection bias actually worsens time this. instance, people vaccinated likely near people vaccinated would guess general. get vaccinated bunch others get vaccinated effect accumulates. says nothing really specific level risk except says getting towards herd immunity people associate with.

Secondly know Israel likely get vaccine versus not... differences behavior? differences live? things properly controlled for? Hint: probably can't... case exact matter matter vaccine looks really good Perhaps use appointments vaccination sites start vaccinating higher risk population like elderly, end day, take leftover doses missed appointments, etc random local restaurant hit many people well.

Anyone currently eating likely higher risk taker potential super spreader. Hitting good everyone.

I think lot people forget ANYone getting vaccinated good us. virus atmospheric problem poses equal risk infection everyone eradicated. every person vaccinated, risk reduced us. incorrect.

The supply failure due line upgrades Belgium. Canada getting share Pfizer ramps up, they've reduce supply temporarily.

It indeed true Canada covid manufacturing capacity right now.

Vaccines getting Canadians too. Mass vaccination sites ready go, lack supply. always easy get vaccines arms LTC home residents, they've vaccinated along LTC workers.

Vaccines 75+ coming online now.

No question issues. let's get facts straight know what's going on. news loves make hay matters Canada significantly whims countries pretty damn interested getting residents vaccinated first.

We'll couple months behind US. That's true. infection death rate 1/3rd US begin with, we're much better begin with.

Federal provincial governments providing significant support Canadians. that's placed Canada different realm too.  No, mean don‚Äôt keep fucking distance. standing line, keeping six feet away staffer comes right restock candy located front cashier. there‚Äôs time I‚Äôm looking product one aisles. One staffer comes up, foot away scanning various items. co-worker comes start chit-chatting random stuff. Costco, I‚Äôve stood line staffers breeze past me, right front nary thought keeping 6 feet away. It‚Äôs happened countless times. staff think they‚Äôre immune????? pisses don‚Äôt even try keep six feet away. Nope. Check 3-day seven day moving trend. They're steadily Die what? Natural causes (old age) assume Yeah, took mum get offered one too.There lots reasons somebody might get offered vaccine early. Covid cause taste/smell changes nerve inflammation, congestion like respiratory diseases, time inflammation delayed. return normal within days weeks, unfortunate individuals reported issue linger months, reported slow recovery, permanent. Honestly I‚Äôm put Biden $1 bill tomorrow. He‚Äôs America‚Äôs hero UK COULD realistically close borders way Australia New Zealand has, would done so.

We saw December absolute carnage happens UK borders even partially closed less 48 hours. terrible 'study', suffering serious case selection bias, really hope would stop reported on. statistics great, great.  


This politicians version science, see one number, divide other, multiply 100, go, got percentage, time put press release. vaccine stops people getting sick, reducing transmission stop health services pressure. That's job vaccine. AZ that. taking ignorant selfish. Listen experts saying take - know great, - seen inaccurate statements above.   actually going No...the store staff probably sick babysitting grown adults minimum wage. Jesus sound like fun guy vaccination programme already ahead original schedule.

This public adjustment schedule take account. Exactly. I‚Äôm super sober don‚Äôt take drugs alcohol continue vote support end destructive drug policies legalize all. coupled treatment rather jail (in cases) help us all. got areas 0.4% population fatality rate already Europe. Severe outbreaks seem pop Europe also expect local infection centers US. You‚Äôre one spouting there‚Äôs times proof. it‚Äôs easy find show it. I‚Äôm one made claim, did. Either back stop talking. Doses disseminated per capita populous states get vaccines, including NY. starting 3rd wave. lockdown .We're basicakly fucked said, selfish. reason skim read covid vaccine ""crack cocaine"" doesn't. Germany many people ignorant attitude doses wasted. AZ vaccine high effective safe reason take offered. I'm glad vaccination huge effect epidemic even places rollout relatively slow. Argentina instance able get many doses (I think barely enough less 1.5% population) cases deaths dropping steadily regardless. facts. study designed show effective vaccine new variant. efficacy mild symptoms clearly lower vaccine protects people going hospital dying, vaccine done job. T-Cell response impacted new variant still elements protection, data determine it. family violating rules ever since end normal Christmas school holidays . Somebody take care kids parents work. household mixing grandma's Everyone know it, including died got family. believe it? Weeellllllll that‚Äôs terrifying 55 year old friend mine dropped dead stroke may, 2 days ""cured"" Covid discharged. course, time, suggestion two related considered offensive, backed off. 

These days, I'm certain died Covid. many old people phase 1 2 trials vaccine trials.

I say Moderns Pfizer reckless took greater risk going straight loads old people without testing first. That's difference early trial make ups, Oxford group decided undermine data.

Of course Oxford group wants data older folk get later. US trial delayed would likely now.

If things went wrong vaccine broadly safe amongst young people phase 1 2 concerns older people vulnerable groups suspect moderna/Pfizer approach would've heavily criticised.

The first important thing know vaccines safe. means data takes longer it. Efficacy also important less important. I'd rather injected people vaccine safe work one works safe. us care whether family survive.  Physical distancing. joke. People fucking stupid understand means store staff amongst clueless. world possible human contact outside world two weeks? living? live alone work remotely afford everything delivered? so, good you. aware people may lucky you. Florida County vaccinating 65+ local community centers. Let's say end day fulfilled appointments open vial several doses left, got put list receive one doses. gotten call yet I'm 30 line get one doses. get first shot guaranteed appointment second shot. 

This opportunity literally came nowhere. Maybe OP comment responding similar circumstance. Thats anyone thinks. think young people think open voulnerable vaccinated. people still unvaccinated really worried stay inside wish minorty point. don‚Äôt know non morally repugnant people callous ignorant what‚Äôs happening Palestinian people look ways help internet. 

Be blessed ‚ò∫Ô∏è eaten chinese person think UK finished vaccinations offer help vaccination drive Ireland. makes sense land border two countries That's specific range lol guess could post 5 different news articles 2/3 65, 66, 67, 68 69 year olds. Don‚Äôt disagree especially test results. trying figure proceed moving forward. Shit hell literally slept almost 3dAys straight Facepalm say woman Michigan contracted Covid-19 died last fall two months receiving tainted double-lung transplant donor turned harbor virus causes disease ‚Äî despite showing signs illness initially testing University Michigan Medical School suggested may first proven case Covid-19 U.S. virus transmitted via organ transplant. surgeon handled donor lungs also infected virus fell ill later recovered. week symptom onset, unlikely contagious. CDC recommends bit longer: 10 days, extra safe. grandma. She‚Äôs vaccinated now, thankfully, lot similarly housebound friends not. keep trying get appointments, they‚Äôre taken immediately technologically savvy people. 85+ Correct. think started 12th 13th. Tested 19th. Results 20th symptoms seemed fully subsided thats tye fucking stupid comment I've ever seen lol ten votes really goes show denial sub is. oh well thank God indicitave real world :) Apparently many people reading article. said safe hug vaccinated family members 2023 parties wearing three masks given 7 doses Pfizer vaccine. Even then, hug one armed shoulder squeeze opposed full hug. hugging also occur live within 300 miles hotspot. happen outdoors. really people hugging all. best verbalize love get handle thing. Covid much easier chance killing lot things. dollar every time someone told i'd enough fund whole new covid vaccine.

Considering articles constantly saying that, decent amount scientific backing, I'm placing bets it. Look subreddit instesd sticking daily thread

And right last point. Covid danger forever, now, I'm focused one day time. Well that's true. tiny waste time resources. 

Personally, take lot time resources, it, almost nothing get rid small risk, that's fine me. understand didnt evidence beforehand people surprised shocked frankly immunology, biological, illnesses like COVID-19 general. 

And fact even though several studies suggesting alot vaccines prevent spread, fact people still say ""well even people gather get together post vaccine wear mask"" goes show much media destroyed people's ability think logically. It‚Äôs rediculous come celebrities parties us plebs can‚Äôt may worried spreading rather contracting themselves. 

The former still technically proven covered vax Literally every state country process easing restrictions. Yep sure, level immunity sterilizing creates selection pressure. US. covid. There's confusion there. definitely covid.

The question symptoms start. provided literature review 27 peer reviewed studies demonstrating healthy food intact expensive July last year, study researchers Max Planck Institute Evolutionary Anthropology found piece human genome increases risk severe illness Covid-19 inherited Neanderthals 60,000 years ago. estimated 30 per cent South Asians believed carry gene sequence

Why paragraph go rest post? coming completely different conclusions? 30% bad neanderthal genes another 50% good gene? I'm Indian rarely get sick (even normal things) I'm usually couple hours overnight .. Also plenty countries progressed vaccination insanely fast German government sat hands. Everything always last minute, building centres ordering doses. excuse ""but harder cause people"" comes often, people also means helpers infrastructure even vaccinated non-relative amount people countries have, bad excuse. 

While world still jokes Germany ""efficient"", federal state governments actually extremely incompetent almost areas expertise. There's party young people realistically vote for. internet! I'm 20 years old wanna die

Did leave house Covid? plenty things likely kill you, even get covid survive, there's good chance I'll long term ir even permanent damage

Can quantify ""good chance"" ? I've seen I'm willing wait little longer everyone else around safe

You everyone else around never going safe. live safe world. make regardless, best can. That‚Äôs title says. Anecdotally I'm hearing way Moderna making people feel like shit second dose Pfizer.

For me, felt fatigued mild body aches Pfizer second dose, starting two hours shot. Fetal better eight hours later, sore arm. Honestly I'm perfectly fine strangers rubbing me. right qualifying risk factors able schedule appointment.

I'm scheduled first today. scheduled last Sunday opened NYS Health site. reload numerous times get queue though, stay around hour. warned folks scheduling risk factors need proof qualification, obtained PCP. issues getting letter mine.

That's experience, also benefit knowing scheduling opening friend works college local site located.

It intuitive process say least. I‚Äôm also NY drove 100 miles Friday first shot. opened new group last weekend location without available appointments one closet me. hear several people getting last minute appointments locally calling state‚Äôs 800# able fill cancellation. get lucky might worth shot (no pun intended!). Palestinians longer life expectancy Arabs neighboring Egypt.

They lower infant mortality Arabs neighboring Egypt.

They better food water access Arabs Egypt.

Now Israel vaccinating Palestinians almost Arab county vaccinates civilians.

Who committing genocide Egypt across Arab world explain numbers? perhaps political stance absurd fictitious. 

You're cheapening tramping world genocide, spitting face real genocide victims, who's populations massacred massive scale diminished.   similar experience getting vaccine. Two people came car vaccinate partner tandem. rolled past parking lot hang alotted waiting period. organized easy. Well delete statement. Thanks. confusion is. Starting back work...I bartend thought dying going back working till 5-6am used it. Felt like hell couple days thought readjusting(waaay tired usual though makes sense). Noticed smell loss 4 days ago. Got test yesterday. Got results today smell fully came back Nobody called dumbass, agreeing you. survive plastic, wood, metals, glass, cardboard, shoes, clothing, human skin, animal fur and/or skin, etc. food surfaces. Hmm. disagree. 

 

Here's thinking ""herd immunity"" vaccines can't really explain current drop:

1. dropping like crazy even places smaller percentages population previously infected (San Francisco, Canada) places;
2. STILL see previously harder-hit places higher rates less-hard hit places. Like, zip code poorer zip codes New York City previously hit hardest STILL getting cases per capita rich zip codes far fewer people previously infected. clearly factors besides percentage population immune swamping immunity effects.
3. vaccination even close high enough explain 1&amp;2.

The OBVIOUS reason drops cases peaks changes human behavior. happened world peaks. Daily stories ""record deaths"" spurs changes behavior governments individuals. Palestinian population grown 2.5x last 30 years.

I bet Jews wish ""genocided"" manner. also wonder distance, Alabama less populated lot smaller towns, wonder there‚Äôs lot less town town transfer makes sense We‚Äôve know eachother long 
Your hearts aching shy say Agreed. 100%. sure individual staff difficult experiences particular weekend crowded emergency room ICU, anecdotal stories make policy. overall statistics, bear appocolyptic overcrowding told about. 
 press also shared sad harrowing stories seemingly healthy young people struck suddenly virus, true are, dont change fact vast vast majority cases occur 70.
 emotions fed media, scary new contagious disease sweep world killing people. Still, need make decisions based facts, stories, stats anecdotes, overall, hospitals full function reality. fact regained smell getting tested unrelated test tesult. Getting tested tells positive time got tested, nothing symptoms. sounds like overthinking aspect.

You got tested, came back positive. means covid. smell came back. means getting better. Whew... relief! thought US UK gave WW2 

That's true, US completely uninvolved. UN authorized partition plan Palestine Jews Arabs. Arabs rejected started war. war Israel embargoed world, making calculated decision believed Israel chance surviving arabs attack them? 

Refused share Palestine way, shape form Jewish state. actually still reason Palestinian conflict exists Also argument Israel ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù illegally years. 

What mean? Washington's dependence generosity also symptom piecemeal, disjointed process Americans getting vaccinated.

This piecemeal process going one enduring stories pandemic. US, think could get point number people refusing vaccine makes impossible reach target numbers. that's case, downsize goals ease restrictions? Cant wait take dump public restroom wash hands imagination either, real thing. people still wiping mail. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* original post mention long sick getting tested.

Has 10 days since started feeling symptoms? symptom free now? likely good go, though sounds like already went back work, guess really understand question.

The bottom line is, 10 days since first symptoms, symptoms 24 hours, good go. Nah feel like symptoms week ago. Took long realize symptoms get tested. Feel Ike I‚Äôm recovery/recovered process Israel already vaccinated significant amount workers (low thousands) gave 5,000 free vaccines Palestinian authority vaccinate medical staff.

If actually intimate knowledge conflict know makes sense, inevitable. Israel already donated medical equipment test kits Palestinians help deal pandemic, well sending team doctors Gaza training Palestinian doctors hospitals. real underlying condition different. However everyone know young got not. aren‚Äôt front line workers anything. They‚Äôve sitting home getting paid well year. Sorry feels redundant trying figure significance regaining smell also relation test result took test smell getting results I‚Äôve regained smell Welcome r/coronavirus. biggest source misinformation covid19 pandemic. Infant mortality rate Gaza significantly lower infant mortality rate across border Egypt lot thanks Israeli support Palestinian healthcare system.

Life expectancy Gaza also higher life expectancy Egypt reason. 

Palestinians Gaza leave longer siblings across border Arab Muslim country, still dare claim genocide? Recently opened groups like comorbidities.

I also live NY group appointment get April 15 requires drive vaccination center 275 miles away. lung disease cerebrovascular malformation. risk factors serious, yet someone 3 years older myself, risk factors, getting vaccinated right now. New York bother consider prioritizing risk factors. age, one risk factor. 6, didnt even mention. I'm teacher. know ton teachers too. Never heard anything like this. nonsense 40 upvotes beyond That‚Äôs confusion is...started workin around time frame assumed exhaustion going back work. Looking back think COVID tested positive yesterday noticing smell 4 days ago. full smell back upon getting results feel 1000x better heard 2nd shot‚Äôs side effects worse lot people. Pfizer Moderna? brother got Moderna felt terrible 12 hours 2nd shot, felt 100% better that. localized outbreaks like Europe? expect even relatively high levels population immunity. US 330 mln people outbreaks severe everywhere. AZ 100% result wrt. death hospitalization. get wait several months get something better gives 95% infection know priority is. literally claimed jump mortality Sweden. jumped 7 8k I'd LOT small country larger ever seen. confronted data move goalposts troll say oh well big jump (it is) fraudulent. fraudulent, prove it. burden proof going spew BS claims awareness Covid drastically increases awareness many people touch things bring home, touch things right do.

The cashier wipes nose mouth touches carton milk...the bagger sneezes fist puts eggs bag...the guy front line picking nose pushing credit card buttons.

I started noticing things last year, wipe items bring home. None us even cold last 12 months...some due masks, lot due awareness touch need wash hands. Yeah, would one get two shots mRNA line one? would make difference? But...but...many, many months masks distancing! 

That never happening. transmission? CVS doesn‚Äôt COVID vaccines yet, pharmacists vaccinations. I‚Äôve gotten flu shingrix pharmacist. subreddit FAQ: IFR covid-19 3x 10x deadlier flu depending age group. feel like people stuff rest lives, even infections less common bubonic plague. That's false. Israel never cut vaccines Palestinians, way around they've provided vaccines Palestinians accord.

Vaccine shipments Gaza delayed merely 2 days families who's sons held Gaza Hamas appealed supreme court, took 2 days dismiss. 

Vaccines already transferred. They're criticizing you, they're criticizing person sharing dataset context. OK. Fair point. change sponsors mid trial? US trial read Oxford sponsor phase 3...but back last Summer/Fall looking studies trial (Moderna, Oxford Pfizer). Bulk better.

But seriously, Sams Club Indianapolis giving COVID vaccines too. health secretary even apologize.

Oh, he? When? Definitely. Given sensitivity around vaccine skepticism, really wish managed part lot better. think unfortunately goof-up led lot added critique AZ. Thankfully real-world samples draw data AZ, much like seeing Pfizer data Israel. dare people careful listen science?!?!?!?

HOW. DARE. THEY. official recommendation contagious 10 days symptom onset, matter feeling. Still prevents death serious illness.

I‚Äôd still take 24 hours? assume still contagious. Except RI, vaccinated need live nursing home, assisted living, subsidized living. Yes vulnerable, definitely 2/3. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* They‚Äòll want opening, we‚Äòll 3rd wave new variant we‚Äòll (half-assed) lockdown again. 

It‚Äòs like watching someone paying part huge credit card debt losing complete control buying new iPhone soon see progress still debt. 

We‚Äòre eternal lockdown people crying can‚Äòt eternal lockdown. long would take tweak vaccine potential future variants? Would even need trials? planning vaccinate doses ? Currently manage 130.000 140.000 per day sleep weekend Exactly. timing announcement makes suspicious MHRA going approve week, Monday, novavax significant numbers doses drop soon approved. AZ vaccine situation perfect example poor scientific reporting throughout pandemic.

By focusing efficacy details made seem like world difference AZ Pfizer fact underlying truth ultimately prevent severe disease death.

The reports EU AZ vaccine heavily politicized ultimately kill people delay taking vaccine wait ""right"" vaccine. 

Never mind untold damage increased vaccine hesitancy. still need special freezers, stored longer times (two weeks initial 5 days) common freezers. Yeah I'm NC, people going maskless think anti vaxx sentiment like machine turn want to. feed suits (AZ, Russia, China) bite back like slowing already pathetic german vaccination campaign CDC never said covid less deadly flu. They‚Äôve said opposite year now. Taking lies attributing ‚Äúcdc says‚Äù fool soul. Seattle way lol Another problem government promised financial help already last summer, yet many companies haven‚Äôt received anything. Lockdown continue, meanwhile file bankruptcy. incidence, 35 minimum Virginia Teacher here. 

My community extremely high community spread. 

We‚Äôve teaching person (35%, masked, distanced, increased ventilation, high efficiency filters HVAC, etc) year. 

I can‚Äôt believe school systems schools couldn‚Äôt figure safely. data fall world nations safely. public servants. Even small child home cushion could work good amount time, decision easy. Teachers unions wrong can‚Äôt see that. BELIEVE scientist answer people different reactions vaccine? sore arm, mom headache felt tired day dad sister bed day feeling like crap. interesting different experiences. people really upset that. want pandemic continue. Well sucks. also programs vaccinate elderly homes? It‚Äôs problem United States they‚Äôre bars, home vaccination shouldn‚Äôt difficult. point really get made enough -- first peak devastating much concentrated places, snowball effect hospitals overwhelming. American, observer Israel 95.3% 70+ yrs olds received first dose.

The rest mainly people covid-19 eligible vaccination (yet). got covid running daily lifting heavy weights. healthy, 1 year later still suffer lasting effects. People realize regular flu, completely wreck healthy person. Please, everyone get vaccine. appointments available area. tried schedule evening 15th. feels like trying steal PPE early days.

Most stories wrong, though. mean trumpets injecting bleach said killed virus lol Higher chances flu killing still lot

I'm afraid long covid passing people die it.  Someone read NTD Eradication Programs. lmao zionist Yes reduce spread deaths. students need vaccinated go back!

...

All students' pets need vaccinated go back! Herd immunity fluid term impacted greatly population actions individuals within population. 

When outbreak Ebola area often find piles dead gorillas basically end entire groups die. start getting sick don‚Äôt know better cluster die.  Yet humans learned taking care people Ebola dangerous could easily wipe many many family members.  birthed macabre sayings like ‚Äúleave food water dead burn hut‚Äù. Situational awareness impacts decisions actions sense give actual circulating population.  turn determine % infection needed population see dips peaks infection waves. 

Right 25-30% America subsidizing thus lowering threshold pseudo herd immunity rest mingling. 

I see reason jettison estimated see coming CDC others put us near 30%.  Another interesting thought ‚Äúout about‚Äù people eliminated vector natural infection probably worth taken equation ones mildly cautious. 

Also think partially infected household like mentioned above. 4/6 members Covid serve vector shield remaining 2. 

My point overall ways explain precipitous drop infections without say easily 55% population it. think estimate 30-35% right easily seen fit experiencing.  Remember still seeing 65k confirmed (obviously crap ton aren‚Äôt caught) infections day.  seems indicate thing still actively running course even 25-30% careful people mostly keeping equation. got covid, think chances actually dying are? US vaccine producing country share countries. 

The US signed contract certain number doses. preventing exports (at moment). Trump signed Executive Order vaccines US bought (not vaccines produced) given countries Americans access. That's different sharing. like Canada shared vaccines countries. Biden seems agree messaging though. actually get issued card? would also help get vaccine people footing bill first. see Hortetz raise Osterholm... Open border let USA vaccinate freedoms. Negotiations vaccine seems dumb money theyre losing shut down. Maybe countries eu start trying procure except Germany? Office National Statistics iirc Citation needed believe studied anywhere. 

So probably fine, also can't 100% sure studied. easily avoid days probably terrible idea good chance nessacary. mean, windows glass right? one sees irony here? Unless you‚Äôre giving bullet proof windows, let open bitches. 

My classroom windows. worry, still plenty reasons. really needs gagged. Saying shit like said make people less compliant more. far think got early lead comes downvotes üòâ think wolf metaphor fits quite well believe people becoming less careful hearing many warnings things getting hand yet KPIs Europe NA steady decline even since bit christmas. different sides argument, appreciate haven‚Äôt called idiot. much concerned ‚Äúdeniers‚Äù comes consequences thing beeing handled, national deficits unparalleled anything ww2. money money instead improving schools , infrastructure hole bunch good things spent corona long time debt paid off. Anyways lets see tomorrow wins downvotes race, I‚Äôm quite confident tough beat. best verbalize love lmao dude crazy person Lots countries weren‚Äôt involved events, every country world deal covid. I‚Äôd say difference Anyone know 24-34 week gestation period used? you‚Äôre pregnant, ideal time get vaccinated? media loves take quotes fauci spin whatever way want starting dislike Fauci Osterholm point. Osterholm sucks predictions doom gloom, they're comical.

Fauci hand can't stay consistent life depended it. Normal spring, actually fall, well maybe summer, semblance normal winter.

Someone needs tell stop talking much. Ursula von der Leyen Commission fucked super hard. don‚Äôt enough vaccines, many countries still prefer lockdown months Wow. can't believe never noticed dips stopped almost number hospitalizations. 

I wondering would good point keep cautious eye things go feel safer knowing worst definitely behind us. Right could number things aggregate, great news matter look it, hard determine vaccinations biggest reason drop.

So multiple successive days 28k is... Here's basic problem AZ... really confidence efficacy actually makes appear worse public vaccine confident lower efficacy rate. issue many using AZ cannot use MRNA vaccines get Novavax offers advantages AZ significantly higher efficacy vaccine. believe immunologic estimates, Novavax pretty similar effectiveness Moderna. lab tests Pfizer somewhat better others though due small number people tested lab immunologically, put much stock that. Data coming including published Israeli study showing vaccine quite effective stopping transmission too. younger person. cannot express God damn irresponsible invincible think are.
So many go (what considered illegal) parties KTVs open illegally clubs etc.
So many constantly contract covid19 go anyways feel bad. 
So many give parents.
My friend's gf's father died covid.

I personally feel elders much risk dumbass kid grand kid around. wonder data submission linking news-medical.net automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said assistant work last week could see even southern states like legalizing tax revenue way Win win would say Different genome.  can‚Äôt understand that, it‚Äôs great news learning vaccine inhibits transmissibility, didn‚Äôt know before. possibility side effects occurring don‚Äôt know about? Yeah Stfu trudeaubot Stupid question, scheduled COVID-19 vaccine tomorrow. interactions vaccine THC? assuming not, cannot find anything online Yes, also think dangerous messaging vaccine hesitancy. yeah cases 3days row last week maybe due weatherchaos week Hi neighbour! Sorry, still making fun variety reasons. good sport though, eh. 

Great job vaccine rollout. Hopefully get caught soon. tough domestic vaccine production ""me first"" world. 

Maybe we'll grab pop dressed chips, good laughs. Yes, remember that., too. makes sense. Well certainly great ends case! Yep, number people I've seen say they'd rather take russian vaccine AZ one shows traditional vs mRNA vaccine issue, also political hit job towards vaccine that's problem, Germans actively contributed to. *Firstly, peer-reviewed published data shows efficacy much higher 60%. Secondly, efficacy surrounding mild/moderate symptoms - runny nose sore throat. What's important stopping severe fatal disease AZ vaccine levels comparable vaccines.*

With mild/moderate symptoms one still get long COVID.

As someone relatively low-risk group low chance death hospitalization, I'm actually worried getting chronic fatigue loss smell taste dying COVID. may may assessing risks correctly (it's difficult, much known prevalence long COVID yet) think reasonable position. Haha Fauci fear mongering Maybe I'll drive Windsor covid vax card try enter, ""Who's plague rat now!!"" mention amount (valid) criticism sending PPE seas inadequate supply Stop spitting face people actually went genocide. yoy shame?

The Palestinians increasing number.

Have higher life expectancy Arabs neighboring countries.

Have lower infant mortality.

More food water security.

All information goes disprove misinformation campaign. think going see masks terms mandates pretty much done summer. suspect ask people hold masks voluntarily they'll let people voluntarily wear move forward. think see people continue wear masks perceived high risk situations like concerts indoors among senior citizens, airplanes, etc. think mask wearing done point summer. I‚Äôve made theory also house. could see possibly happening. Makes look better event turns better thought gives buffer explain self say never said would day x Raising generation morons ol bethel elroy dont die 3 months would anyway Story ironic given story tearing USA new @ss vaccine producing country (supposedly) export vaccine. Okie dokie. Well, good day. Earned. Maybe USA earning way moniker. power them, so.

That's goes - earn shit, earn shinies. Yep, mean. 

My normal going bar/restaurant every often, hanging indoors friends extended family, maybe little domestic travel.

I cannot see would almost return family/social circle vaccinated. could see possible time frame sure. Medical community hold onto long possible absolutely feel comfortable. could see little earlier ever peer review confirm data coming Israel finding vaccine stopping transmission among vaccinated. No, he's not. EU receive 4x vaccines Q2 Q1 based official delivery schedules.

This official delivery prognosis German ministry health (BMG):

Q1:

BioNTech/Pfizer: 12.2M 
Astrazeneca: 5,6M 
Moderna: 1,8M 
Total Q1: 19,6M (23% population)

Q2:

BioNTech/Pfizer: 40.2M 
Astrazeneca: 16,9M 
Moderna: 6,4M 
J&amp;J: 10,1M 
Curevac: 3.5M 
Total Q2: 77.1M (92% population)

Considering Germany gets fixed proportion EU vaccines based population, extrapolate entire EU. Sorry sir, wear mask her. wearing mask wearing mask two different things. thing is, fine older kids younger kids really struggle. kids need extra supports. literally pull kid homeschool October January hard time e-learning. five year old panic attacks. kid sensory processing disorder look lot like ADHD. needs able move breaks often regulate sensory needs. school, accommodate needs. computer, missing lots instruction assignments difficult literally sit long enough. school, wide variety options choose from, physioballs, bean bags, stand sit desk, sensory paths, etc. stuff home truth is, stress e-learning high needed constant input.


After consulting therapists, doctor, school, reading multiple studies spread school, monitoring local numbers closely, decided send back in-person February. He's great, 12 kids class 30 kids packed small space. local positivity rate 3% aligns state numbers well. Also teachers vaccinated 2 less vectors spread. B117 B1351 allready rise

B117 already accounts 22% new infections every day necessary loons wear mask shops wash hands. recall correctly, similar effect found SARS, large reductions LDL cholesterol cases elevated triglycerides. process? news outlet calls Fauci morning, spins wheel, gives answer we'll back normal, done masks? I'm really optimistic. realistic based previous vaccines current polls. reason great support brazilians saw people dir diseases 70's, like meningitis epidemics saw vaccines salved people lives.  

What's stopping 90% goal, lack actual vaccines. 

Anyway, archive collective immunity, would need 90 vaccination, yes. coronavac 50% efficiency, AstraZeneca 60%. Pretty different Pfizer get 95% efficiency, vaccinate less people archive that. never ski shows. brought infancy birth rate. I've shown thanks Israeli aid Palestinians actually better fellow Arabs neighboring countries. 

Gaza ruled Hamas, Palestinians west bank ruled Palestinian authority. Israel. middle east toilet areas ruled Palestinians need accommodate large immigration 

lol what? immigration Israel much lower many European nations, virtually effect Palestinians living west bank Infant mortality Gaza 14.9, Israel it‚Äôs 2.3. 

Gaza ruled Islamist ISIS like Hamas. What's point? That‚Äôs dated information contrary CDC FDA says. need dick accuse able read care every hundred years, plan ramp testing manufacture testing materials moment something like happens. That's get ahead it. gave using testing prevent spread early going take long get mobilized. testing capacity much better, early widespread testing would made difference isolate outbreaks spread control. Schools absolutely going require masks well next year. Mine already said so. best, we‚Äôre going open hybrid model fall. People focusing ‚Äúeveryone vaccine it‚Äôs going perfectly normal summer‚Äù ignoring fact kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated. Yes, don‚Äôt seem get sick covid, plenty people still want cautious want protect children. seems pretty unlikely although people may voluntarily wearing airplanes stuff. I'm glad practice country/region requires make specific diagnoses.

Outside billing think lot issue comes medical professionals society general classifying mental health differently ignorant management. knowledge depression experienced brain particularly helpful ""get it"", helpful pain.

When someone come ER chest pain suspect context anxiety/panic, say ""it's head, go home"". Instead gather history, explain many causes chest pain ER best suited diagnose rule small number major life threatening causes, we've ruled talk else could be. come back post testing reassure something dangerous, explore causes. Unless clear alternative cause try leave things open ended, discuss pain worsen anxiety anxiety worsen pain - I'm suggesting anxiety causing pain, I've seen many patients make aware pain less able cope etc etc. finish suggesting follow plan persists recurs, tell watch for.

It might faster say ""it's heart, head, go home"", ignores suffering provide tools understand address symptoms... Makes feel ignored/misunderstood etc etc.

That kind medical practice lazy unempathetic. Well yeah, America politicized pandemic measures. moves stupid horrifically consequential, else gonna laugh? much do. Hopefully covid clears up, try convincing harder let get blood test since another reason cite hospitals might harbor virus wanna take there. strange since really worry incidents like virus much general Well there's option people want choose best one. That's right? issue people unhappy stuck second best option. happy either I'd probably take it. someone know sounds knowledgable, perhaps answer lingering question mine:

Pfizer Astrazenica said ~90% efficacy. mean 1 every 10 people immune? Or, average, vaccinated person‚Äôs immune system confronted covid, 10% time immune system might conquere it?

I‚Äôm really wondering, veing vaccinated, big‚Äôs chance I‚Äôm immune still get long covid seriously ill? (NB. Long covid one really don‚Äôt want!)

Thanks work home care Toronto COVID cases among nurses PSW's absolutely staggering, yet ones vaccinated piggybacking onto LTC retirement home clinics. zero control work environment since go crowded apartment buildings control wears masks many people enter elevator them. cleaning staff sanitizing surfaces private homes. COVID+ patient needs care, expected service without question. Yet ignored vaccination rollout far. RN friends lucky experiences definitely representative entire profession. /end rant Lol won't. Humans short memories  guys bald eagles too.... IP laws. vaccine companies stingy give production licenses believe starts tomorrow. pandemic us year. Anybody still home Canada point ample opportunity return. I'm Government Canada helping Canadians outside country, far pandemic believe taxes used accommodate still travelling choice.

There's story CBC morning woman study/work visa coming end think pay $2K quarantine bill decided come home visa done. I've got friend similar situation (study/work visa outside Canada) returned home soon able. Shocker, they're safe home incur $2K quarantine costs introduced year pandemic. sure you‚Äôre snotty that, we‚Äôre subject, appropriate time stop wearing masks? Yikes vaccine long u guys still vaccinated frontline workers. state. preholiday levels yet. idea legit, sticks me. like August, Russia‚Äôs vaccine seen joke whole world, now, there‚Äôs people saying could useful. United States vaccinating 50 60-year-olds 90-year-old grandmother still waiting.

The headlines misleading. still tons 75+ one shot yet USA. Numbers may show 16-18% population vaccinated (reality 5% fully vaccinated), far evenly distributed. agree, US finally get elderly compromised individuals vaccinated, see can't start siphoning vaccine friends north. (not fun) fact, America First used heavily slogan KKK. muh free health care Yep. Woke news alert phone. Way start day ü•≤ Yeaaaah.... Brazil 72 year old father can't get vaccinated, supply horrifically low, great president ~~didnt buy vaccines embezzle money~~ incompetent bought late. think reduced spread US also eventually positively affect Canada too, bright side. Sinovac started testing kids late 2020 too. Canadian here. Maybe Canada shortsighted privatized vaccine producing crown corporation (so became French left). Maybe Canada economy based 17% real estate getting rid manufacturing capability. maybe relied Chinese work vaccine 2020 wasting time research(but Trudeau loves Chinese genocidal CCP....yum!).

My point directing criticism USA want take care own? lol

Direct towards Canada's shortcomings  Germany Belgium sending vaccines ordered Canada? vaccines manufactured plants located countries sent Canada? mean probably find county offering certain brand, go somewhere else. Generally around five days later. Could two weeks, chance gets lower every day past five day mark. Thank suggestion . I'll give try. young maybe live parents bring concerns to.

They care much it, that's issue. thought universal healthcare, gives? reddit claim America third world shithole system? criteria become ""when say so"" switching fuzzy link control variants instead something measurable like ""let's try overrun hospitals"". good development opinion, still infrastructure place test contact trace/contain. set us something indefinite, quite frankly destroys credibility people like Fauci. think international travel festivals back normal time next year? not?  would concerned families‚Äô strange rules Covid honest. shit show think point, can't consistent messaging, acknowledge great strides made since beginning year, provide *desperately* needed optimism, say damned thing all.  thing is, know whether b/c prime minister dropped ball. compare countries produce vaccine. headline, indeed, article, quite different ‚Äúheading‚Äù, interview gave. interview answers fair, reasonable, certainly indicate making projections (which news anchor asking do), accurate data front today, Sunday. 

And even then, possible scenario would fit communities virus still certain percentile, folks haven‚Äôt vaccinated. hate Californians friend absurd rent prices, live smallish city Idaho alot industry rents absurd, we're talking 3k 3 bed apartment 5 years ago 1100 most. work 70 hrs week every week cannot afford cost living im truck driver. Countries took seriously countries want get back normal. 

I mean upset US take seriously better vaccine options guess that's fair. world that's often works out. US powerful richer that's allows make mistakes fix like this. That's truth it. frustration Fauci comes insistence keep tougher masking distancing measures throughout 2021, even though vaccines widely available summer. advocates this, governors mayors listen him.

What alternative though? much I'd love us drop mask distance measures, virus care what's convenient us, political, it'll thing regardless want.

The responsible thing say right continue masking distancing throughout 2021, alternative worse:

If tell people ""Hey, get vaccinated, wear masks stay indoors anymore!"" going people go get sick vaccine fully kicks in, people still contract virus 100% effective, people go pretend they've vaccinated been, people incorrectly assume everyone who's safe around (not realizing contributing problem assume gone).

It would absolute nightmare tell people early could stop wearing masks practicing social distancing. Strongly disagree major issue.

Right now, Pfizer could give away vaccine recipe, nobody else would capability manufacture it. Manufacturing vaccines scale *is really hard*, almost nobody capabilities it, it.

On top that, right selling every dose putting out. though doses sitting around, wasted, nobody willing pay them.

Finally, actually think private companies came looking rather good. Pfizer created effective vaccine robust manufacturing record time. Oxford/AZ making profit, bungled trials least effective vaccine likely approved globally. What's covid infection situation versus Canada? everyday life different?  Probably, long tests negative.

Not much changed regarding people coming Mexico Biden, policy Trump. Fauci needs stop every talk show sun. Assuming person, assuming someone virus passed day instant , long would take symptoms show generally ? long keep eye parents well? 2 weeks? thank work president trump task force.   truly remarkable you‚Äôre conservative

What word even mean, 2021 America terms? What's bogus units measurement? ""20.5 million years lost life""? Can't say many people died. "" number people died covid = x amount 9/11s. worried parents still respecting autonomy.

Y'all need get nuance. There's middle ground ""don't care"" ""complete isolation."" Germany Belgium sending hundreds thousands doses Canada btw. I'm sure rules like governments way halt exports, we'll receive first 25% doses Europe. forgetting future. European here! feel guys frustrating. effective, sign insularity times. legal right spread irresponsible nonsense, mean severely criticised it. Use soapy water alcohol-based disinfectant clean surfaces person touched. diplomatic way ask person keep mask on. they're responsive request, keep long distance possible. young maybe live parents bring concerns to. effective group target back would morons, point gotten it, we‚Äôre seeing infections continue rapid decline, beyond models increased vaccinations. targeting people exposure last uninfected morons, would teachers, grocery store employees, bar tenders, etc. Wow I‚Äôm sorry hear that. thought everyone position would gotten least one dose now. wonder huge regional differences. I‚Äôm Southern Ontario far Toronto. think many people willing redo year variant, unless drastically increases cfr. fatigue real. really think workers fighting rights safe work environment bad... maybe society collapse. fucking reason billionaires using abusing low paid labour backbone society. entire fucking planet needs work reform. Unionize. Fight rights. guy, here, too. like overpaying Starbs. exercise bit home. social, well I'm social much much changed give vaccine hospitals, vaccine sites people go to. visions vaccine, got vaccine sure hope get guys covered ASAP. America needs friendlier hat well! think residents UK generally refer living states... counties, maybe?  can‚Äôt believe got downvoted funny Basic human kindness? Guarantee Canada manufacturing vaccines guys would demanding them. would share could. probably gonna fine. Try worry unless hear person tested positive parents start feeling sick. point worrying much then. *that want it. 

We 4 vaccine drives county beg people eligible take it. 

Can guess country?


Spoiler: it‚Äôs Deep South. believe EU purchased vaccines whole individual country basis? Sure, EU cross border traffic closed country chance negotiate vaccine purchase, Belgium (where Pfizer Europe plant located, believe that's Israel got supply from) would negotiated better vaccine deal now. can't compare New Zealand controlled COVID extremely well. fact, friends New Zealand stopped worrying Covid looong time ago. Midwest know tons people like in-laws. IMO change mind matter what, Fox News Trump's messaging start solidified opinions. hope get end getting vaccinated times comes. Yeah, supply exceed demand USA, I'm sure we'll helping countries providing vaccine.

That said, considering last couple ""stimulus"" checks included ton foreign aid dollars far exceeded budget stimulus checks Americans, put past ship vaccine elsewhere Americans able get first shot. Brain damage fever highly unlikely. 

If you, I'd worried consequences mental physical health 6-9 months. getting exercise social interaction? Exactly! What's rest world wrong? /s poorly preventing mild moderate cases e484k mutation containing variant seeing pop place. going mutate there. concerning? preventing transmission, allows variants spread giving opportunities mutate even beyond immunity. I'm saying used, think ""doesn't matter"" laughable I‚Äôll take upvote. Best pumpkin spice latte. required enter place business mask on. Also walking street near people wear mask well everyone else does. that'd mean start applying spreaders. Europe Canada objectively great innovation logistics. care way collective responsibility compared personal responsibility. reason get butt hurt continental friend. spread misinformation. What‚Äôs point? still can‚Äôt afford easy-shatter glass. neutral observer, far condescending him/her. Yikes writing tone. Super bizarre, right? We've complete shambles year yet thanks superior manufacturing base, we've managed reach cusp defeating pandemic. anything pandemic shown us schools need funding, less. Yes US allow come ""approaching degree normality"" Christmas. Seriously, fire guy. Deep breaths, November wedding good. worst case scenario you‚Äôd set households 6‚Äô apart, even that‚Äôs unlikely almost ridiculous.

Mazel tov! think lot things worry Covid took *convincing* family let damn thermometer. Actually, vaccinating 1.7m people day would take 300 days fully vaccinate virus, since take two shots. Dismissing ridiculing kid worried parents.

Stay classy, daily thread. Yeah, nobody sent us vaccines ordered yet also end flu season daily cases declining rapidly worldwide regardless local vaccination rates. Correlation causation.  That‚Äôs fine even advanced nations don‚Äôt supply. There‚Äôs moderna UK, example.

It‚Äôs fine want best, supply constraints Pfizer/Moderna. It‚Äôs silly dismiss toothed options. I'm NC, expect see coming months. summer, people gonna DGAF, blame them. Vaccines way forward here; people stopped responding mask shaming numbers numbers. 

Just like 1 4 deaths US heart disease equates around 665,000 people year:  [Heart Disease Facts | 

It's horrible, like it. dialysis unit, handful elderly people received 1st dose times lapsed way 42 days people start new 1st shot. None nurses vaccinated. way social distance setting either. I'd like know where/who Edmonton getting shots claim people getting. high risk situations like dialysis units. patients active covid there's 2 isolation rooms sitting within 2 feet people 4 hours time, 3 days per week. Eh doubt it. Cases dropped lot Michigan, yesterday 600 cases. Wasn‚Äôt long ago 5000 day. Oh yes, plethora studies Israeli data forgotten ‚Äúcorrelation causation‚Äù good thing reddit remind Send dew thanks Lol trump. Think you‚Äôve hiding rock. 85% efficacy 28 days. know long immunity would last.

This research important means countries probably increase time two doses, mean second dosage ignored.

Maybe new research come showing case. data now. blame media, politics casting doubts vaccines votes, without thinking - oh may kill lot people this. German 7 day average 413 people died.

The leaking dodgy data German officials couple newspapers help. say 8% effectiveness.

Macron calling quazi effective basically working 65

EU commission (and Fauci) saying UK approvals dodgy researched properly. Criticism decision extend gap boosters, ensure reduced deaths quicker.


You reap sow, deaths, longer economically damaging lockdowns gift anti-vax conspiracy theories, vaccines likely drop. Well done, hope votes worth üëèüëèüëè Thanks Boris UK‚Äôs overseas territories getting vaccinated well. Bermuda grateful. 

I‚Äôm sure Biden Administration whatever send help countries especially neighbors get vaccinated quickly possible. benefits US see world vaccinated ASAP. I‚Äôve stayed inside year toxic family‚Äôs sake I‚Äôm seriously reaching breaking point. dad hard staying home, calling selfish wanting find job place own. wants wait things world 100% normal, according Fauci, isn‚Äôt gonna anytime soon. It‚Äôs convenient job work home don‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs okay me.

My brother also threatened disconnect phone service repeatedly past year even talk working moving can‚Äôt go anywhere. 
That‚Äôs got fight parents beginning February he‚Äôs hiding room ever since, coming meals. less giving rest us silent treatment month. someone received Moderna, thank service. I‚Äôll continue wear one vaccinated courtesy. people won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm vaccinated, mask help put ease. I‚Äôll play ear ditch mask. really, data comes really shaky methods agree sentiment reality need get old people comorbidities vaccinated regardless live. owe them? Nope. ""deserve"" anything less humanitarian morality scale? Nope. love God put aside send shots already shut fuck world reopen.

But still, fuck Canada anyways. country shuts citizens enhanced flu virus get fucked. But, world's top doctor Fauci said today mask-wearing could extend 2022 though? means Trump, Boris, Netanyahu managed lead countries effective vaccination programs worldwide. Think it... mean, American, guys never enough spread cases concern us, vaxxed, would care y‚Äôall are? 

I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt help Canada, highlighting mindset. hope everyone get soon, I‚Äôm America first all, lot people people aren‚Äôt going care Canada regardless happens there. didn‚Äôt even care America except asked mildly inconvenienced refused comply. point armed takeovers government buildings attempted kidnappings political figures, etc. submission linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Hope helps! Agreed upon deals sharing vaccine production distribution Canada since broken little warning.

Vaccines supposed gotten deal end January/Beginning February pushed back April May. remember...California people Canada. said ‚Äúif believe‚Äù gives fuck? Either way slice it, elected septuagenarians presidency last two elections. really expect Biden brilliant decisionmaker age? Presidents defined large part people appoint make decisions them. Trump made decent choices front regard vaccines. Give credit due. I‚Äôve heard friends family US states already vaccinating without even asking ID, risk involved think it‚Äôs best option. Especially considering many cases deaths occurring right now. 

Ecuador fucked least new president May. Without getting much politics, current president extremely incompetent staff (with big part staff resigning past week). lot corruption cases going around, Ecuador strong allies government pretty much alienated left right past months, one even remotely capable wanting associated current administration.
Some scientists even volunteered work organizing lockdown measures prosecuted corruption.

It‚Äôs disheartening least we‚Äôll get functioning government soon regardless ends winning. Even Venezuela good amount vaccines secured. test lab.

1) take freezer. 

2) wait.

3) measure. course quarantining perfect (though certainly easier among disabled individuals already housebound isolated). point one feel pressured told ""illogical moronic"" making personal decision vaccine help most. disabled groups, risk long covid complications existing disease much higher severe covid death. cases, makes complete sense want vaccine prevent infection. 

I would also like gently point discourse like part overall societal trend silence discount disabled voices comes issues impact us most. You‚Äôre healing, concerns make dr appt get checked expect post get reposted 50 times sub. way biontech chose coldest temp give best chance vaccine would safe, effective approved record time. Adding lower temp testing would added additional time would slowed process. also need stop letting people say it‚Äôs hopeless vaccine changes nothing loudest Nah fine. also appreciate seeing posts regularly details(and good news!) Many Americans think government's job ""take care people"". cases plummet vaccines roll out, Fauci realizes becoming irrelevant desperately needs stay public eye rush book speaking tour... We'll take J&amp;J still good.... proof masks worked one point. high risk individuals, understand wanting safe wiping groceries really interfere lot definitely hear you‚Äôre saying, quite frankly consider objectively incorrect. basically saying majority world leaders, large corporations, scientists, doctors, high ranking government officials collectively wrong. entire thing massive over-reaction covid wasn‚Äôt really blip radar.

You understand degree consider nonsense totally looney. you‚Äôre saying true you‚Äôd think none would ever happened first place. Neither us would writing covid, we‚Äôd probably heard it.

You‚Äôre basically saying everyone authority multiple different countries got wrong somehow. ever heard expression ‚Äúif think everyone around crazy, crazy one?‚Äù totally applies here! True, cares em You‚Äôre immune STDs I‚Äôm sure forthcoming book something insatiable love lights hard say depends settled science around spread is, number cases circulating area, rate severe cases per infection. high-risk people folks forced contact public (cashiers, teachers, etc.) vaccinated, probably need masks anymore. 


if guess, would say end May schools get summer. warmer weather, people outside, reduced spread/risk due vaccinated people, schools would likely result conditions allow return normal. may still situations need wear mask longer that, like airport, retirement home, etc.

it depends, though. could hook man. Like said, we‚Äôre great logistics. Luckily, Fauci charge government. State governors already loosening restrictions even super lockdown-happy places like NYC. think there‚Äôs lot reason optimistic. Vaccine uptake far purely theoretical, vast majority people matter want AZ vaccine. 
It's available us way things going right probably going stay way next year... CNN doesn‚Äôt bother much Canadian networks. CTV gives lot airtime Toronto-area doctors constantly negative, constantly complaining, constantly dooming, I‚Äôve sealed news coverage life. Dr. Fauci least balance messaging optimism voice future. Yes, that's correct. We'll probably start predictable abnormal proteins something done scale today's tehcnology intent (one day) sequence individual's cancer cells identify potential attack surfaces. 

It's sci-fi technically feasible today's technology (at significant cost), although scale standard treatment. scale requires: 

* Cheap sequencing (this basically - sequence genome $1K - cheap cancer treatment standards) 
* mRNA vaccines suitable delivery mechanisms (sort here, asterisks) 
* Ability quickly spin patient-specific RNA strands use mRNA vaccines (not quite yet - done high cost small batches mass customization scale low cost yet) 
* Computer-aided (machine learning) targeting - feasible way scale computer able predict optimal targets extremely high efficacy (with low risk unintended auto-immune side effects) - theoretical problem right key scaling individualized treatments. even really regulatory structure place today ""approve"" something like treatment. makes wonder kind person thinks name like acceptable, good idea well.

Seriously, people never heard proper decorum? colleges Berkeley-style quarantines subject lawsuits over? european countries talking about? Portugal saying 'quite high adherence containment measures' big stretch. Minimal adherence maybe. Healthcare workers prioritized worldwide. Lol let‚Äôs real US could invade Canada less day literally country would anything except send strongly worded letter. act tho Canada power. isn‚Äôt 1865 lol. Americans want something Canada they‚Äôll get would even determine point? Like genuine question, could know less year long term life expectancy someone disease would be? Event Bullshit. kids born fall 2017. winter one worst flu. Newborns can‚Äôt get flu shots. blame falls vaccine manufacturers meeting quotas, that's possible federal government made shitty deals, never bothered prepare pandemic supporting local vaccine manufacturing. there's absolutely moronic rollout strategy, focusing limited supply fly reserves Arctic circle never never see single case. still proof people getting COVID items contact groceries specifically. majority Canadians understanding guys need get shit control sending us huge vaccine shipments. one Canada ridiculing old dying people America. white privilege, think BIPOC Canada? Good. Let‚Äôs leave anti-vaxxers cold. want drink bar prepared get vaccine. ???? 

The study done Israelis Israelis vaccinated. Palestinian vaccination program completely separate started recently. fuck knows. We‚Äôre never going get meaningful answer took raw materials Canada make N95 masks, tried prevent actually making back border healthcare workers source subpar meltblown masks China. I've got box me, quite literally say ""not medical use"". 3M CEO even explain shitty idea screw means production, still let fraction original purchased shipment through. I'll never forget that. US allies, brief agreements nullify within years. Yeah, totally OCD. called common sense taking precautions. Thanks playing; better luck next time! much critical get two countries vaccinated variants circulating countries. though. Vaccines reduce spread virus. isn‚Äôt evidence yet 0 % chance virus can‚Äôt spread vaccinated. ‚Äúmisjudged‚Äù active discouraging masking, still areas basic preventive measures ‚Äúsuggestions.‚Äù Japan even started. single person. hear success stories ""slower expected"" news. BF first psw LTC. Private run differentiates. Finished end Jan snd whole building done (residents workers). downtown might also factor in.

Had huge outbreak one already palliative resident died. zero symptoms. Good luck shaming entire store. You‚Äôll irrational one. Right on, welcome world everyone else living since March. actually start listening problems rather instantly saying ""oh, people it"". 

Communication important understanding why. pandemic certainly social standpoint, growing group thinks loud, outspoken chunk never followed social distancing guidelines. need stop letting loudest Damn right, redditors ridiculed United States should‚Äôve built vaccine labs themselves! /s means still ways spread virus vaccinated. disagree would surprising significantly reduced spread all? 

I mean, fact lowers viral load makes stay system shorter amount time means even though it‚Äôs contagious it‚Äôs shnoz, it‚Äôs gonna stay long. 

You treat two separate questions/comments wish. I‚Äôd appreciate info this! looking understand good idea, feels like preparing extra nice cancer treatment routine diagnosed instead stopping smoking gonna get first place. would prefer see headlines reducing industrial animal agriculture around world, end pandemic breeding grounds even start. bring mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility scratch, qualify ramp production millions needed would take far longer waiting line. reason haven‚Äôt built new facilities anywhere, expanded current ones. 

You fight army have, one wish had. due yesterday first one, reschedule next Saturday. Instead spent Saturday mopping shop vaccing apartment due thawed pipe hall sprung leak came apartment. Thanks, mother nature, things. üò¨ get sauce fries? See... purposely allowed numbers get bad could try #1 vaccination rates. USA! USA!

Obviously jk, hope things get better Cana-brothers! messages spread always extreme needed know complete compliance happen.

If tell people safe vaccinate lead two things. Vaccinated people wear masks - could spread non-vaccinated people small rates (we're waiting see). importantly, people start lying vaccinated order stop wearing masks public huge problem.

So counteract tell everyone wear masks time even people bubble vaccinated occurring private location. absolutely level trust community.

This like last years ""you need masks message."" trying prevent people hoarding. know people many problems understanding overall intent. actual message tailored lowest common denominator. Canadians stop believing mewling kittens get stomped time blame. need realize things:

1) lot Americans found first time year anti-Americanism core concept Canadian identity, informally personal level formally historical level.

2) Many went interpersonally rogue period US undeniably worst world last summer fall.

- calling cops people American license plates, even though logic tells closed border mostly Canadian citizens *have chosen return Canada remaining US*
- eventually escalating behavior property damage
- calling us ""plague rats""
- national meme nice / luxury apartment meth lab, got popular became op-ed *Rolling Stone*
- letting wilder posters (who clearly happy see Americans dying) go unchecked *months*. Yeah, can't stop posting, took long time Canadians stepping regularly tell stop.

The previous relationship complete illusion sides. I'm glad stopped. ...""neutralization B.1.351-spike virus weaker approximately two thirds. data also consistent poorer neutralization virus full set B.1.351-spike mutations virus either subset mutations suggested virus mutant residues receptor-binding site (K417N, E484K, N501Y) poorly neutralized virus Œî242-244, located N-terminal domain spike protein.""

...

These perfect news. However still need studys real patients blood samples see much difference ""two thirds"" make considering Biontech efficacy South african variant. classes? couldn‚Äôt everyone in, say, English wouldn‚Äôt enough English teachers teach concurrently. kids level? get summer off? so, it‚Äôs regular summer school. let get ahead? you‚Äôre going large group kids graduate semester early, lot extra free periods. take class? it‚Äôs remediation, differentiate instruction level kids. takes serious retconning actual history public health advice masks. [This CDC advice late baffling many people seem claim always knew right thing do. ""I give week.""

""I'll give 11 minutes."" know, wrong wasnt thinking parents one superior? mRNA vaccines 99% efficiently preventing severe cases, good rate sterilizing immunity, even hold strong South African mutation.

As AZ vaccine. Oxford much lower numbers across board also suffering bad new strain.

That incorrect comes preventing serious illness death. metric matters context. Optimized end game paid dearly along way. I‚Äôm American know us, vaccine way it‚Äôll end. have... certain mindset things. Oh $. Wanna look us instead belittling word choice? us vaccine roll seems like jealousy 

As Canadian don‚Äôt see issue US‚Äô vaccine rollout. It‚Äôs success story country hopefully learn emulate success. US withholding vaccines Canada? keeps getting asked questions answer right now. 

When everyone get vaccinated?
When stop wearing masks? 
When things normal?

The truth wait see happens spring, Israel good early indicator way ahead us. Everyone wants answer right way knowing right now. going do? Pfizer said: Hey, know vaccine ordered? Yeah, going deliver it. bad, sad. He's wizard magically make vaccine paid appear thin air. Like hate Trudeau, 99% beyond control. That's human rights violation better go away everything fully reopens. may find surprising Australia place low rates Covid. Even adjusting population ( 1/9 means US adjusted death rate still 5x Canadian one). like sending dire department neighbors house burning down. outbreak US far worse Canadian one measure continues foreseeable future. logical moral reason divert vaccines death rates equalize countries. mom 55 healthy, condition may smoker reason torturing mental health past months can't get vaccine.

For record work vaccine plant doctor. !RemindMe 2021-07-31 23:59:59 cringe. Nah, fuck off. shaming doesn‚Äôt work me. tell, supply bottleneck weeks now. Administration ramped big time recently. Would vaccinated American allowed travel freely Canada?  Fauci incapable giving good answers shouldn‚Äôt getting front camera. government employs people that, trained communicate media public. risk people vaccinated spring end restrictions damage, people significant danger vaccines available need opinion. take food. That's one wondering about. Last year dreaded watching numbers go up. love hearing numbers people vaccinated. year like reverse last. price freedom I‚Äôm betting don‚Äôt wear glasses you? question when. got symptoms; I've heard need wait anywhere month half year. funniest part chaos eyes is

**TWO** companies developed *SAFE + EFFECTIVE* vaccines within **10 Days** People like talk crap CA, CA leads way right thing. Show done CA! Compulsive anxious behavior. trying years stop picking face/biting cuticles etc, thought Covid would finally catalyst change. Nope. unconscious, hands wanna near face. I'm least able control I'm potentially covid-infested public, though. difficult find English language sources. contracts suppliers forces supply locally allowed export. US UK schedule EU not: shouldn't. people protected, would lock people island? Wait still spread virus even you‚Äôre vaccinated? listening interview one candidates vice-president Ecuador pointed need South American block kinds emergencies. Kind idealistic impossible, form alliance might able secure higher number doses country better deal.

The region polarized would nice set aside differences times emergencies every while. Many rural areas gotten hit harder per capita many cities. feel like getting away main discussion I'd like bring back:

What I'm trouble understanding comments linking population density drop cases sort natural immunity. happening cities, suburban areas, rural areas. density this?  manufacturer's recommendation far recall. insufferable brand parent everyone despises said wasn‚Äôt household name 13 months ago people corrected you. That‚Äôs issue deal with, everyone else‚Äôs. Car accidents joke, COVID killed 1400% accidents year. still relationship family, vaccine risk goes normal. I‚Äôll wait rather kill last lap. hope grandma vaccinated get soon. literally 70m people need tricked killing themselves, need apologize book. What's take medical field variants going around relation vaccine? cautiously optimistic vaccine works fine new strains potential new ones, personally expecting pandemic (in US) while.  Man, college depressing right now. cold day, constant clouds, havent seen friends since march. feel like everyday repeat last, wake up, get computer,have classes, study, go gym, sleep. Emergency RN large hospital, still vaccination either. would relationship? Actually thing called insurance probably wouldn‚Äôt pay dollars! it‚Äôs ok little guy, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get vaccine scraps soon! I‚Äôm fine. vaccinated, working person, wearing mask Herd immunity mostly topic academic interest. 


The combination vaccination high-risk individuals, low community prevalence minimal non-restrictive NPIs (get pretty sick, go doctor, doctor says COVID, self-quarantine feel better) keep virus negligible levels concern long true herd immunity ever reached. American, it‚Äôs shocking. funds, bought vaccines anyone, distribute it. weird part world would make fun us, turn around want us world police again. Pretty much, although, scanning article, saw nothing referring estimations future lifetime lost. seems subtracted ages Covid victims life expectancy country, added up.

I love researchers ""estimate total 20,507,518 years life lost due covid-19 81 countries included study."" Yeah, really confident number specify 8 significant digits. scheme make really large number. Blah.   Agreed. Cheers second shot!! Except growing evidence vaccines mitigate transmission. Hardly surprising, already know prevent symptomatic infections, huge leap assume removing symptoms limits spread virus Well that's fair. Vaccination health procedure, forcing coercing health procedures human rights. also individual thing everyone needs get work do. also currently aware potential risks vaccine, people risk covid may content risk covid. discriminate based people's health choices. seems like simple answer me. think nefarious nature see shit governments cover years later. MK Ultra, Project Paper Clip, scapegoating Iraq 911, weapons tests, list goes on. USA.

I imagine country like China hiding whole population microscope able disappear anyone even attempts speak ill. Good Fauci speaking country I‚Äôm sure whole time. love able hear Fauci speak country 150. scenario us whose livelihoods stabbed gut pandemic totally, irrevocably fucked? Name shame? (maybe using alt account avoid possible retaliation) curious, Israel managed get many vaccines? Dang, might onto something...

Selflessly helping others actually feels really good keeps people sane, gives lives meaning.

In US people simply take anti-depressants anti-axiety medication instead. Yo..chill out.. needs come say support types measures continuing. Instead repeated interviews suggests measures going continue 2022 beyond. believes needs specific means, people start assume he‚Äôs lost Biden needs toss administration. Well expect government shuts world virus vast majority people recover it? weird, mask never gets wet want stop wearing one soon possible hate feeling breathing wet cloth. genuinely don‚Äôt care. Go fall stairs pay 10 grand loser. mean, looking covid stats I'm pretty happy canada tbh... here. given difficulties delivering vaccine likely we're going get one chance year. family gets sick need come home take care them? can't always predict may need come back. They're likely skipping it, waiting year. Rich parents time give kids edge mind paying extra year preschool. case, smart distance schooling worst pay child care anyway. kid born last half school year, I'd it. ""could"" big word lockdown even lifted yet close already retroactively blaming lack lockdown infections one month before.

At least creative ""this real lockdown!!!!"" said maybe something approaching degree normalcy 2021... hedge tried. person turned 70, I‚Äôm much offended bemused aggressively shortsighted comment. really ""Orwellian"" theyd pushing mandatory vaccines..oh wait would good thing. Uh oh Canadian vaccines gonna cry? agree. Don‚Äôt get wrong, like Fauci. garners lot public trust good reason. think media lay guy. dynamic situation estimates always change. can‚Äôt faulted offering professional assessment based knowledge has. go! able make point much better thinking want convey expressing words. People keep blaming government.

Don't get wrong fact production issue (but current PM's fault), however vaccine contract says many doses receive quarterly monthly. cares companies behind last month end 1/4 get required per contract. US vaccinating producing themselves, noone else.  Completely agree. you‚Äôre 8th grade don‚Äôt really ‚Äúget‚Äù prealgebra, pick next year, it‚Äôs end world. ages 4-8 right now? don‚Äôt get brain plasticity back. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Good. I‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôre wrong. quick google. Idk think this. Whatever. understand, best track record aids epidemic either. Honestly surprised he's able keep job point. People read headlines want outraged. Thanks breaking Don‚Äôt worry bud, someone also high risk several high risk family members, wipe groceries too. (As well always wearing mask, social distancing avoided big indoor crowds, getting vaccinated).  People aren‚Äôt high risk denial whether they‚Äôre high risk idea it‚Äôs like high risk group. No. truly dumb. start proper faith vaccine people take it. Things like hurts helps. 

Headline needs ""miniscule spread Covid vaccine. Keep wearing masks, start living life normally. Go eat, go spend money community, let's get back business - responsibility vaccine""

Long headline message. transparency - second shot yesterday live ever heard CARES act? spending primarily includes $300 billion one-time cash payments individual Americans (with single adults receiving $1,200 families children receiving more[5]), $260 billion increased unemployment benefits, creation Paycheck Protection Program provides forgivable loans small businesses initial $350 billion funding (later increased $669 billion subsequent legislation), $500 billion loans corporations, $339.8 billion state local governments.[6]

Have heard CARES Act 2, extension previous act? one still force US Government working third support package people. December 27, President signed next stimulus bill Congress passed December 21. legislation extends unemployment assistance employees also independent contractors self-employed individuals 11 weeks. bill (H.R. 133) includes ‚ÄúContinued Assistance Unemployed Workers Act 2020,‚Äù provides extension CARES Act unemployment provisions December 31, 2020 March 14, 2021, including provisions created new form benefits self-employed individuals: pandemic unemployment assistance (PUA). 

Your ignorance stunning. saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make guarantees. idea goes, can‚Äôt sure.‚Äù feel like sub needs learn read news outlets stop overreacting things like That's good, 1.8M right? Plus news I'm seeing around spiking next 1-2 weeks production comes online. AUG 5TH official order search, Aug 20th 31st finally secure order.  Months months Trump USA.... yet Trump failed act? says CNN lol

In late October spent $214+MM Canadian labs research develop vaccine.... Months later have. He's trying save ass. Uhh guy 100% civil discussion. think he‚Äôs ass well, hooo boy, lemme tell ya you‚Äôre hopium addled crackhead looks like they‚Äôre falling apart merest mention troublesome data. Pretty much everyone around 1% Neanderthal DNA average, exception people sub-Saharan African descent. excerpt relevant article re: aids. dishonest.

It bit amusing watch handful veteran AIDS activists long history Fauci, one went frustrated adversarial friendly collaborative space short years late 1980s early 1990s.

In time, Fauci, simultaneously sitting amiably ACT activists parrying belligerent public protests comrades, opened activist recommendations. notably, dramatically loosened HIV-drug clinical trial requirements far greater number desperate patients could try new compounds (an approach called ‚Äúparallel tracking‚Äù), expanded research HIV/AIDS treatment underrepresented women and/or people color, gave activists people living HIV seats table planning committee AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).

Fauci also played key role getting federal research apparatus incorporate recommendations, amounted perhaps first time federal health bureaucrats acceded almost fully community activist demands.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs man moment,‚Äù says Peter Staley, ACT Treatment Action Group (TAG) veteran grew close Fauci would often dinner together Washington, D.C., home Fauci‚Äôs assistant, James Hill, Ph.D. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always skills matched epidemics. He‚Äôs one best scientists epidemic control, translate complexities epidemics lay terms way engenders trust almost audience speaks to.‚Äù

Says Jim Eigo, also ACT treatment activist veteran, ‚ÄúFauci sparring partner us, friend.‚Äù recalls letter recommendation parallel tracking ACT UPers sent Fauci. I've battling ""vaccinated people spread covid"" yarn while. Like virus lurking healthy vaccinated people waiting spread. Good luck that. You‚Äôll 10th amendment get around.  think would still gladly take hope get Pfizer give real sources here... reporting done actually informs us Biden administration already pressured states immediately administer doses squirreled away storage second doses. 

States stashing vaccine allotments second doses trust federal government supply steady stream vaccine, local government would answer citizens could get second dose time. 

The biden Administration working hard give information local governments projected supply 3-week lead, comfort states trust future supply organization feel OK give stored doses immediately people. 

This likely resulted already increased vaccination rate last weeks.

[NYT: Short Vaccine, States Find Hidden Stashes  Amazing news. Means vial thawing issue goes window. chuck vial fridge doses use remainders tomorrow. immature child would respond comment insults total lack empathy. That's I've heard. Depending vaccine, second shot hugely add effectiveness bit weird. spite trump, him.

Remember said something 20 million people vaccinated December end? happened dunno you‚Äôre getting downvoted relating actual facts. big databases record every single health issue, every condition every disease citizens.

This data pure gold big pharma agreed agreement Pfizer share database improve vaccines treatments exchange priority vaccine delivery times. think wearing mask damaging? that‚Äôs we‚Äôre talking about. actually thinking making comment similar this. wonder impression would Trump still office. Say want, vaccine numbers would roughly right regardless office put 100% you.

This really fault.  Generally recommending people wait 3 months diagnosis live vaccine. can‚Äôt deliver host countries forbidding exports. Vaccine nationalism, predicted literally everyone.

The current government assumed place order vaccines like you‚Äôre getting dish set Amazon. goat rodeo.

What needed was:

1. Secure rights manufacture 
2. Expedite building production facilities. 

We neither, criticized real time. It‚Äôs almost like messaging changes information changes. No, Yeah, agree capitalism. saying countries equal better state infrastructure US.  dress code follow every single day, along public health mandates. tells Canada much Coronavirus. live long long long past point stigma shame worded meaning say much better. Even profitable, things like need keep Canada, privatize, infrastructure situation arises. intend say could get facilities running year two. Thank you. Husband Canadian doctor (Ophtalmologist sees 30 patients day) whose mother law is, shit not, recruiter COVID trials medical researcher Montreal's biggest hospital ...

Yeah first mother law ... get vaccinated receive notice scheduled vaccination, stop higher doctors (who doctor anymore) getting vaccinated everyone else sidelines ... Roll beyond pathetic hospitals ...

Wife gets told two colleagues Friday ... oh ... maybe ask 'association' that, still heard back, friends fields gotten vaccinated friends hospital network telling ' oh call number, vaccines left over'

My parents Florida pleading travel winter home ? Oh ... Got vaccinated FUCKING PUBLIX, that's right, place buy lotto, groceries cigarettes. whole condo area got vaccinated 'flamingo pool parties' every night ... Growing evidence, yes. Confirmation, no. It‚Äôs defence production act European equivalent. 

Gotta hand Israelis tho. fair. also think realizes level, considering responded interviewer pressed muse mask wearing beyond 2022. 50%. ‚Ä¶ like wearing mask guy lmfao it‚Äôs deep. I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm worried getting sick, like wearing Canada vaccine infrastructure would vaccines. thank Donald Trump Fox News. can't let go zero covid, unrealistic never end. hope people fight then. wish best, I'm UK despite really far ahead vaccinations still insisting increasingly insane restrictions. [Skip don‚Äôt feel like watching Michelle Rempel Garner making ass herself. think finally figured out. Yes comes EU pool, EU states take full Pfizer allotment since working others, Denmark secured additional EU pool. 

So: yes EU, proportionality longer balance.

Whew. work needed be. *Most* word used, case missed it. surprised even NZ's economy recover like US will. We'll see. Biden's America Four countries. Two successful countries importing vaccines EU. 

Vaccinations centers built December. anything last moment.

Vaccines ordered earlier, UK ordered announced together US.

We ask Merkel creature, von der Leyen, could happen? Fuck, sacrifices I've made past year one painful far won't. read subreddit. People wanna go party see grandparents. care Dude, I‚Äôm quoting something posted day. assume aware ‚Äúcorrelation equal causation‚Äù bc they‚Äôre idiots US feeding supplying Britain war business involved in. welcome.  agree. massive mistake Trudeau. Thank you, fools take approach give normal folk someone laugh skittishly shop PPE years still scared shadows also may reason travel, too. Without business trips attractions normally open, vacation travel also lower normal. Many Americans cars &amp; safely keep distance people, enabling travel happen, without something travel for... did, really hate americans Which, according this, could happen July employment posting Canada, I'd petition employer pay re-entry requirements. pause society pathogen *some* people can't take vaccines young children hardly affected it. you‚Äôre going make widely available media need recognize media quote you. love Fauci damage making *too* available media circuit. get don‚Äôt like him, good you. literally nobody cares. God love Trump president anymore.

America finally great again. B-Cells memory cells immune system. T-Cells discover protein originally produced RNA, present B-Cells, rapidly produce antibodies. perpetually producing antibodies, otherwise would perpetual cold/flu symptoms. Absolutely. I‚Äôd singing favorite songs site calling loved ones celebration. employer requires out-of-country hired Canada, I'd petition employer cover re-entry Canada costs. chose work U.S., accepted living working foreign country whatever ramifications come that, like break U.S. law law Canada...just American make unaccountable laws.

People make choices lives ramifications every choice. general higher populated areas higher outbreaks far understand, independent vaccination rates. 

But that's actually true. Per capita, many rural areas hit harder. 

And still NOTHING topic discussion - question cases dropping cities, suburban areas, rural areas lately. Correlation equal causation. Old guys likely bald, age makes likely severe cases bald. state moving start vaccinating factory retail workers. Seems reasonable vaccinate people work places super spreading events likely. Give month supply everywhere suspect. 2 months trying get people door. We're told children less likely spread virus, yet schools still closed almost year later. 

There seems clear path fully reopening, even worse we're told one day week meets goal. tweens teens targeted vaccination date Fall 2021 early 2022.

Of course school sports seem okay they're given go ahead dozen states. anti makers already wearing masks.
And definitely looking cdc anywhere else confirmation. Ya elderly parents haven‚Äôt met grandkids yet seen talked anyone irl year, also full immense amount severe health issues definitely patience. You‚Äôre right. Thanks! That's 'more restrictions' part.

It still pays $2000 / month support pandemic I‚Äôm amazed didn‚Äôt say 74,222,593 people. 
üôÑüôÑüôÑ ! big difference. one contract private company, note EU could done AstraZeneca. legislation forbids sale outside UK. 

Also, know this. would suspect contract would along lines of; ensure meet UK supplies deadlines given, AstraZeneca freely allowed supply contracts. (otherwise would AstraZeneca sign agreement limits supply).

the difference contract fair playing feild either EU UK could put stipulation time say ‚Äúthey made sure supply UK only‚Äù 
i mean say want, suspect also factually incorrect. say suspect UK contact said AstraZeneca AstraZeneca try best efforts supply UK requirements first. go customers.

I understand getting votes, me, topic quite emotive one. personally want discussion it, i'm wrong corrected. blocking exports ones actually sharing limited supply New Zealand, Australia Canada commonwealth nations.

this nobel them. think UK vaccinated everyone donate vaccines countries. know large support populace (again i'm getting source). make sure prioritise blame EU.

I cant blame prioritising themselves. im sure blamining EU. thought early comments EU Ursula von der Leyen. although timing etc, complicated, could wrong this. ofcourse many discussions brexit, although case export legislation issue. sure brexit comes play. mean maple syrup pretty great. Well nonsense. 

I mean group 65 two infections. 
One vaccine group, one control group. recommend data? Sorry vaccinated, I'm done masks. stores mandate them, make fuss anywhere stop wearing them, be. comment linking marketwatch.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Okay stand corrected. problem yes much expecting everyone give people? line, restrictions damaging combination vaccination infection herd immunity reached eventually. Moderna's promised sue pandemic apparently: made similar statement though assuming everyone falls threshold receiving aid able get it. know people processed application last year still gotten anything.

just cuz something work mean bureaucratic system lets need aid receive it.

everyone impacted this. hit lot people lot critically Care elaborate ? Governor nothing vaccine production.  idiots (aka lot folks around here) still wearing masks mid year let alone next year. Yeah, late party. much invested sanofi GSK.

I'm wondering info TV2 wrong. Though clearly remember conversation extra purchase...  mRNA vaccines gets degraded within short time period totally gone within couple weeks, like mRNA body produces make human proteins. can‚Äôt imagine healthcare right now. situation bad enough it‚Äôs own, anti-masker Covid 5G crowd‚Äôs affecting day day, seeing end results etc. would likely break me. 

I don‚Äôt blame tired. burnout rate amongst peers must all-time high. Getting shafted government small portion public time, might spontaneously combust hearing CEO.

I really worry longterm effects frontline healthcare workers. already shortage issues (speaking Ontario) before, aren‚Äôt expanding med school/residency spots great rate, ageing population...something change break. 

Anyways, hope relief comes sooner expected peers. Yeah huge guaranteed order US didn‚Äôt help s/ possible ""some"" americans ans everyone know wont statement ‚Äúdegree normality‚Äù isn‚Äôt manipulative- defining meant interview. asked define it. 

And so, indicated believes ‚Äúnorm‚Äù end year, far closer norm pre-covid 2020. know: 2020, bodies hauled dozens refrigerated trailers outside hospitals full capacity? everyone know personally critically effected, flattened, devastating impact? *That* degree normality. 

Saying something relative manipulative. eyeglasses sit top mask seals shut. helps too. Irrelevant case. 0.3% Population. It‚Äôs people like think ‚Äújust wearing mask‚Äù infuriate rest us realize gave government unprecedented powers combat something quite frankly, highly survivable cold 99% population... potentially short sighted. interruption supply shots foot. entered human trial last month probably won‚Äôt available end year/2022. You‚Äôve got even odds bring buildup static electricity sparks house fire succumb to.

Yes. Go hug parents dude. That's fair, think mask indoors is... free easy? numbers still dictate wise precaution? Pretty much exactly Fauci said article? news articles say one point canada buying twice vaccines needs? didnt say dumb article said dumb statement... Care elaborate choosing inject body based risks affect people choose vaccinated (since they'll immune point vaccine first place) 'very stupid'? still long time kids babies get vaccinated. Last estimate read fall older children 12+... also others can‚Äôt get vaccinated reasons. It‚Äôs people refuse vaccine. think agree EU actually OK job Pfizer vaccine terms getting enough doses. suppliers could send us similar numbers, would vaccinated fast UK US.... Yes half people following reddit think given headlines like ""EU invoked Article 16 NI protocol, order restrict vaccine exports"" ""EU confirms export controls vaccines"" even though EU announced monitor state. look vast majority know UK contracts supplier gives priority effectively stopping exports even closest allies. majority redditors think EU blocked exports though.

People get mislead

Edit: Anyway enough discussion. follow weeks gets really exhausting. Even New Zealand news report EU blocking exports getting supplied brussels vaccines ... Actually it‚Äôs got nothing money. Canada gave plenty money. 

The USA facilities manufacture vaccines allow vaccines exported Americans vaccinated.

The situation Europe. India exporting vaccines care soft power favours rich nations lives citizens.

On bright side, we‚Äôre probably first line Americans get it. border still closed, that‚Äôs costing Americans money. article pretty point take. said pretty much thing comment reasons back mentioned? think saying link.

In general higher populated areas higher outbreaks far understand, independent vaccination rates.

You made curious double nyc denser counties cases, aggregate cases falling. Also highest infected areas significantly different would see large disparity.

I think argument places historical cases see sharper decrease compelling. intuition (backed data) makes suspect explanations (like behavior density) explain local differences independent factors. I'm far line I've ruled possibility getting vaccine 2021. Actually bad comparison. first post, comparing aircraft entire world. save neighbor, save first better able help others.

In example, sinking ship entire world? case would mean sending vaccines children weaker people around world others addressed. impossible coordinate simply make sense. would lead people dying. country sharing supply others country safe. Europe fighting allocation even though supposed union. That‚Äôs happened. Dr. Gottlieb really optimistic spring/summer morning Face Nation. Said fall could problem due SA/Brazil variants, time make boosters. Seriously! would drive day could get mom vaccinated matters who's first file patent. Pfizer Moderna likely patents could affect other's vaccine, they'll probably figure cross-licensing deal pandemic Pfizer's partner BioNTech started refitting existing facility mRNA vaccine production Marburg, Germany last September. started production weeks ago, first shipment expected April. took months refit, imagine takes build facility scratch.  CDC estimates 1/3rd country gotten it...we‚Äôre pace less .5% country dying...

Explain survivable 99% population wrong... need harder lockdown long current measures bring infections down. time, may need harder measures. NY Times piece exactly daily briefing. California? Cali need prove age. requires paperwork. Otherwise, I‚Äôd vaccine now. that‚Äôs approach taking, people apologizing putting words mouth. stated goal 100 million vaccines 100 days, pathetic ridiculed. shouldn‚Äôt assume plan commit that. 

If want go say masking could continue 2022, take word acceptable position hold. ridiculed crucified statements. Bird flu spread easily far 9npy found farmers working around birds. Bird flu found people years already Biden going step mishandling pandemic I‚Äôm sorry feel way isn‚Äôt true. don‚Äôt know anyone Canada making fun people dying US. I‚Äôve seen people criticize Trump administration anti maskers doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt care deaths. Many elderly people dying Canada too, nursing home near 60 dead. deaths anywhere tragedy nothing laugh about. I‚Äôm also sorry feel Canadians wanting vaccines order paid somehow ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù thing. Canada multicultural cities world vaccine plan includes getting vaccines affected, includes BIOPIC communities. I‚Äôm sorry grandmother, one deserved die stupid virus. Lol get fucked Canada superior healthcare Reminds documentary ""Triumph Nerds"".     
Quite good. want things go back normal anti mask look Australia normal concerts etc masks hope that. know it‚Äôll take time probably end year don‚Äôt see us wear masks next year achieve partial herd immunity hospitalization goes like Australia did. Yeah, head pandemic response decades experience infectious disease think past year scientific recommendations ""magic 8 ball guesses"". 

""I personally disagree timeline given scientists would know impact COVID therefore scientists need shut up. Scientists **LIE ME** better news get triggered ignore then"".

No wonder coffee cups need ""Warning: Hot Coffee"" label them. people incapable learning. 

I'm surprised made far without ""owning"" red light driving oncoming traffic. colors guesses anyway, right?  Source? COVID bind human cells ACE2 receptors them. abundant airway lungs. receptors blood vessel lining, rare enough odds someone get infected way small. draconian. I'm giving basic evolutionary skill recognizing interpreting human faces rest life infectious disease 99.5% survival rate. dehumanizing I'm even going pretend okay ignore negative consequences.

I willing tolerate vaccine here. Within next couple months risk able get it. Beyond that? Fuck masks fuck anyone suggests kind new normal. Maybe helps bit. think shitty health policy would 4 years trump give younger people! 

That's presumably. Agreed! I'm tired sales pitch lesser vaccines. Instead honest lack supply people try oversell it. one refuse anything that's mRNA novavax, part certainly due feeling lied manipulated wonderful public messaging. surprising. British variant increased 6% January 20% February. Without lockdown, would see Germany saw UK December: exponential growth. How? People already hard time following rules places declining stats vaccines. Good luck convincing everyone wear mask several years called consequences. Fair enough, everyone thinks federal government somehow able control things. sure would thing ability. suspenders. Well US recover well I‚Äôm sure. don‚Äôt think necessarily recover better NZ. LOOL huh? Why?  Ain‚Äôt good enough. need go one dose vaccine many people fast can.  it‚Äôs still possible universities could still lot classes online come fall huge problem ask ID. ten percent population it, among demographic groups much higher.

Why earth would want middle pandemic prevent something even happening? happily join anti mask protests happens. means nationalism unfortunately common phenomenon. partly human nature even though know better. Excellent -- thanks!! That's called coercion, thing consent. tell someone can't work based choosing get vaccine, personal health choice, giving fair choice. factoring unrelated things decision based solely health. Yeah lives America. yall keep goofy ass facial procedure LMAO, admittedly he's real sport want hate Fauci Fauci really selling whole ""hating Fauci"" thing. people different states different people countries? would like vaccinated want prioritize high risk individual based nationality. agree like strategy wish would straight people. seems like what's going things like vaccine supply (the timetable moving get doses), shots arms (initially 100 million first 100 days track far exceed that), etc. thought maybe keeping approach. Hoarding would imply doses eligible bodies - case. Around April last year read something like one six New Yorkers knew someone died Covid terrified me.

Fast forward today think everyone Los Angeles name people died. sensationalist competitive-fetish headline. million ways compare countries COVID. 'New Zealand 100% better COVID response America' gets lot clicks 'New Zealand COVID response 100% effective'. agree. hope least end March, places like NYC restrictions significantly reduced. reason make small businesses suffer much longer almost half USA adult population likely sort immunity point.  looking age gender account health condition victims pre-covid. 

For example CDC identified strong evidence number risk factors increase severity COVID caused number severity factors indicated study deaths vs baseline age extreme false equivalence assume groups compared life expectancy. next happen endless loop. Here's idea. Shut everything down. Yea sucks dying worse. It‚Äôs inevitable masks new norm near future every single measure every single thing done prevent 500k deaths? would recommend? Complete authoritarian control everyone's life virus goes away?

Wear many masks once? Shut everything down? Water, electricity, netflix, shut virus goes away? non-denial? complete seizure society resurrect 500k? It‚Äôs that‚Äôs saying it. need wear mask even 2nd dose nowhere near effectiveness Israel. certainly ‚Äúgreat‚Äù yet. 

So would satisfied US literally number 1? Clearly story indication US playing fair

Fair? US transparent vaccines start. exports get constituents vaccinated first. Sorry, sorry. ponied money, manufacturing, distribution, etc. get reap rewards. Yep! Got new glasses made difference world daily basis. highly recommend it! build, staff qualify facility size might take 2 years more? bought need then. course might be. Good ide ready next pandemic current vaccines identical first second dose except Russia's Sputnik, use different vector. volume believe same. 

Pfizer 0.3cc per dose, Moderna 0.5cc per dose. Yeah well... totally blew begin making MASSIVE mistakes made. USA shattered image was, make mistake. 500,000 Americans dead. Sure Canada's vaccine rollout atrocious let far worse public health failure happen here. somehow people still find way shit USA comments SMH Nicely done!! don‚Äôt worry breath!! believe Oxford-Astrazenica said believe updated vesting ready autumn rollout. variants become none issue long vaccine whole world, countries afford it. joking right? going give mRNA vaccine country first rate healthcare system? world going get AZ vaccine, cheaper, robust, easier produce. recall reading stories said Canada reserved massive amounts vaccine doses manufacturers. Example story said enough vaccinate country 4 times over:         
   
What changed? 145 million doses set delivery next 5 1/2 weeks, additional 200 million expected end May 200 million end July.

An extra 145,000,000 doses April. Assuming perfect two doses per person, that's enough give majority adults first dose early April. honestly think goal, whether publicly announced goal something internal, seventy percent adults getting first shot end May. believe would around 120,000,000 people next months, feel pretty reasonable Pfizer doubling production likely scenario Johnson Johnson's vaccine gets approved. many people infected, would effectively mean herd immunity.

If Biden right, think we'll safe enough normal summer. Maybe high expectation, that's really gonna would make say good job. sit coffee shop without mask, bike around town go beach, anyone bother social distancing capacity limits, I'll say good job. high standard absolutely think achievable. Jesus, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND dead still think it‚Äôs cold.

That cold WW2. also likely somewhat dishonest efficacy claims lot bad PR supply EU.

A lot image problems seem self inflicted me. know covid side effects long term either. right now, they're looking way worse. I‚Äôve tried chill upbeat I‚Äôm done patient (Canadian) government. fucked vaccine rollout up. April hear you. American country give vaccine country asks free. $4 dose would rounding error defense budget. big deal? forced. taken choice.

There may however, consequences takng it. That's choice make. leaks seemed like EU signed contract great  quote BIDENs press secretary??? completely unrelated rollouts almost 100% based supply. 
The US major country earth sharing vaccine production, that's surprising all. 
This massively backfire US diplomatically, burning bridges seem like unreliable ally. 
Especially Asia many US allies talks China even Russia, EU enough supplies. 
Meanwhile China sending vaccines world making diplomatic connections. 
While US focused EU currently supplying UK, Israel, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Canada, well sending emergency supplies third world countries across world supplying 27 countries internally. 
Belgium alone produced many vaccines could vaccinated 10x already people actually thankful EU, specifically Germany Belgium isolationist mindest said already early last year vaccines would shared entire world. 
For example 63% UK's vaccinations supplied EU. Covid: 500,000 deaths
H1n1: 12,000 deaths

You definition Covid denial. Yeahhh, get second shot, I‚Äôm good.  friend doc called help ICU worst it. He's back emerg. He's London. vaccine. Asking government-issued ID hard thing do. none really work SA variant.

We're going lockdown next christmas thing. plan send everything states let figure out. took longer otherwise would this, zero federal anything. Ever asia mask wearing normal years? one laughed there. completely right though...people selfish...

They don‚Äôt want risk sniffles, demand everyone give lives...rather taking proper precautions themselves... I've eaten restaurants bars (both indoors outdoors) throughout entire pandemic Northeastern US legally allowed times count. Clearly, I'm deceased, knowledge, yet contract COVID. one know operated similar way died fallen ill. 

Take whatever worth. mean really ""scare mongering"" IMO ""ABC news dude"" saying: 1) reach herd immunity, 2) big threat anymore post vaccines lives familiar again. Like I'd said, article posits same: deaths &amp; hospital #s go down, Pandemic done, back normal. 

I think u/thosewhocannetworkd saying TV suggesting. wouldn‚Äôt solve countries undertook similar measures didn‚Äôt solve it. I‚Äôm looking Germany, Italy, France, etc. 

Perpetual lockdowns don‚Äôt solve pandemics sure fuck everyone‚Äôs mental health. 

So spare bullshit please. actually 50m plus DOSES administered. Around 10m plus people fully vaccinated (2 shots) leaves around 40m plus people actually vaccinated around 30m getting 1 shot. well put Trump administration vaccinating 800k people per day. new administration lmao too. initial no-mask recommendations indeed based science. available research showed exacerbate infections. Bat lady researching weaponize bat coronaviruses last 15 years Wuhan publishing results scientific journals along way. need harass farmers now? never ""changed"" anything - talking two separate categories, even saying things like ""likely"" ""hopefully"":

**High school students could begin get vaccinated COVID-19 return classes fall**, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday.

‚Äú**That likely occur fall. can‚Äôt say day one school starts fall term**,‚Äù Fauci told anchor Chris Wallace ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù

The Director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases said officials awaiting results trials test shot‚Äôs efficacy younger population.

‚Äú**Hopefully time get fall term, vaccinated that‚Äôs we‚Äôre pushing studies occur**,‚Äù Fauci said.

But said younger students likely need wait longer receive jab.

‚Äú**When younger children, likely first quarter 2022**,‚Äù Fauci said.  bunch vaccine companies closed facilities Canada time conservatives power (that's I'm seeing Trudeau around time).

Whether specifically conservative governments actions time, likely plethora many economic factors globalized massive companies consider choosing setup manufacturing, r&amp;d, etc. understand focus this.

The fact matter current government power failing procure vaccines spend globally leading amounts %-GDP versus peers. beaten countries also domestic production, also spend less GDP per capita do.

Personally care whether conservatives liberals nonsense, performance spending point view bad leader, believe Canadians would best benefit country focused holding current governments scrutiny instead playing partisan finger pointing games. coworkers absolutely terrified bringing students back classroom masks/distancing required we‚Äôve received doses vaccine. It‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing. So, country can't make cars can't access them? planes? Maybe basic logic countries hoarding Yep, totally Biden previous administration started scratch upwards 800k people day vaccinated. cant believe people look numbers shrug. unimaginable numbers man.

My wish 600k barrier never crossed Fair enough.

But long would need show for? 

No one anything like Spanish Flu way! You‚Äôre allowed vent said really spot on. I‚Äôve tried think would cope happening still college. would honestly mess. mean I‚Äôm mess lol there‚Äôs lot pressure young people get lives together set future. There‚Äôs little time phase phase kid without autonomy. guys stripped period time scolded simply feeling frustrated. Shits fucked. got second Pfizer shot Friday. knocked ass almost entire day Saturday that's left arm soreness. Regardless, take side effects covid day week. honest you. pleased way masks effected flu year. definitely thinking pulling habits forward tbqh. wish girlfriend would read asked personal sacrifices would solve it, answered that. ask new idea already proven. 
It sounded like challenging idea personal sacrifice would fix it. gave example personal sacrifice solve pandemic within country thus proving personal sacrifice work. 
You ass, typical response someone wrong shown be. sub spend several months flaming US terrible COVID response? Also, probably fair headline comparison. US quite people Canada begin with, financial resources cover costs. Unbelievable. People seriously willing give human avoid residual risk getting sick.  deaths conditions causes addition COVID-19, average, 3.8 additional conditions causes per death. 

Some conditions induced covid cannot. Every report seen conflates issues probably difficulty knowing came first. read it, say anything UK blocking exports? Right...because quarantine definitely wouldn‚Äôt problem job... silly thinking would problem hop plane right now... exactly one behave? hypothesized way could gotten number high blindly looking actuarial tables years life remaining making effort account health individuals died. looked study ""internal logic"" determined correct. correct. constantly amazed information available clicks. old enough remember Encyclopedia Britannica is/was? Blows mind short lifetime, went information overload...can't wait downloaded cranium like Neo Trinity...by we'll wifi'd direct head...boy took tangent, eh... Thanks answer, I‚Äôm glad hear say that. lack domestic vsccine production absolutely seems caused lack market incentives. lost sense smell taste couple days ago. I‚Äôm waiting set results Thursday. anyone tips solution get senses back quicker? really fucking blows covid December vaccinated 10 days ago. hit 102.4 fever weather couple days, would again. wife also sick couple weeks me. similar reactions vaccine better within 3 days. isn‚Äôt recommendation one way different personal choice imo, glad hindsight. governor country going run platform social distancing next year. Masks, gatherings, etc. one. comments keep getting deleted wrong. mood place gone way right, screw grandma, masks make face ouchy, it‚Äôs cold. personal favorite today - ‚ÄúDeath normal.‚Äù all. said high schoolers would get vaccinated year said actually 2022. know say instead changing dates moving goal posts time many years conservatives power? rightfully mad Trudeau rollout also acknowledging huge part conservatives played n selling production capabilities disingenuous. dumb, laughter recourse. mean would right creating two groups basis, including one particular governor ‚Äúgood‚Äù group would leaving lot important things out, know. Thats heard youtube politician. That‚Äôs part problem is. Yes, he‚Äôs doctor elected. However he‚Äôs face government response. mission get people certain action via encouragement fear. lot doctors, Ashish Jha Scott Gottlieb particular starting wonder public health officials pessimistic. Unjustified pessimism going discourage people. 

The problem people take says gospel hold come time take cap society. I've checking thread multiple times day noticed well. Nuance, social media, seems impossible, even though, Reddit least, be. great see someone call out. I've seen multiple posts go something like this:

""Fauci said **may** wear masks 2022, dare he!?!""

And usually end ""Guess I'm going move Florida protest this!""

I think folks tired hurrying waiting something like comes along feel immediate need respond it, negatively. However, posts talk good news, upcoming surge vaccines, Gottlieb talking see surge horizon.

I guess I'm trying say folks feel immediate need react anything Fauci anyone else says slightly pessimistic, take breath, research, read watch actual interview, see others saying. going get this. someone completely vaccinated, still wear mask public stores feel lot safer encounter someone isn't. planning hanging someone, indoors, also completely vaccinated. NYC regressed back 70-80s. It‚Äôs dump one wants visit

Do actually live here? true. talked somebody work today (from distance) said want office full even everyone vaccinated efficacy vaccines less 100%...

In space one year, successful species earth's history managed become risk averse anything less 100% guaranteed safety enough make folk try avoid simple fact share existence billions people.

It's absolutely mental. Well, maybe PSAs I‚Äôve seen plenty celebrities tv talking vaccines general. assume people talking done masks distancing they're vaccinated like - lowest-risk group, means time that's personal possibility them, virtually vulnerable groups, essential workers, etc. vaccinated.

While places may quicker appointments whatnot, means phase may stagger couple months, absolutely correct general timeline restrictions coming end. need achieve herd immunity total eradication end restrictions, need put end virus sending people hospital threatening lives. vast majority accomplished vulnerable population vaccinated.

If July, vaccination available general public several months, elderly vulnerable groups almost 100% vaccinated, hospitals deaths consistently sub-flu levels, mass uptake vaccine looks remain consistently high, time restrictions end, whether we're 40% 75% vaccinated.

It's different story somehow vaccination opened general public yet vaccinated vulnerable. see would happen, though. Lmao Trump got 800k/day. still Office literally would case. Well yeah, vaccine we're talking children young - requires separate rollout. think may conflating two vaccine categories. LMAO long time mess big relief hear that. seeing family year, things makes life worth living? COVID restrictions killed spontaneity life. Soon say 2023. ends choose to, say it‚Äôs over, never say it‚Äôs over. Fauci joke. Wow came say American US citizen crazy. honestly starting feel like vaccine never going happen finally able receive it. truly understand health care world US would know see articles like wonder hiding people üòÇüòÇüòÇ. angry callers everyday calling complaining frustrated know exactly get vaccine. Don‚Äôt think means aren‚Äôt short. I‚Äôm sure still millions people unvaccinated wondering turn. Officially two weeks post second dose. Gonna go lick shopping carts Target. another quote down:

And since transmission would seem depend viral load (among factors), reducing viral load across population (as shown significant decrease PCR positivity) would certainly expected slow transmission. non-peer reviewed study published website medRxiv, researchers studied 304 people (223 male 81 female) hospital northern India two weeks last summer. patients aged 10 80 reported Covid symptoms. 

Up three times less likely catch Covid wear glasses, according study, yet everyone study reported Covid symptoms. Umm, what? Well that‚Äôs weird. cannot *wait* son able hang friends group activities. That‚Äôs kids *do*. actually stay-at-home, especially hard him. pretty upbeat it, normal. College still really unique environment community I‚Äôm getting experience. time still comes once.  ok chant [USA way le Mighty Hahaha sadly it‚Äôs hard tell what‚Äôs irony days Regarding Brazil variant, don‚Äôt think lab studies vs Pfizer/moderna, however simplified understanding, since mutation seems problematic South Africa variant mutation expected problematic Brazil one, think it‚Äôs least reasonable assume they‚Äôd ballpark, give take. Would nice see something concrete though sure. Serves right. Chinese bootlickers. is, that's many people talk covid. novel virus can't predict anything extremely cautious every random fucking symptom person happens get covid fucking cause alarm. 2.5M deaths times 16 years life equals 40 million years, also wasted year lives restrictions, multiply 1 year times 7 billion so. restrictions probably worst policy decision last 50 years. anymore. second phase starting. bought anti-fog spray glasses last week. Life-changing. Êó•Êú¨„Åå„Çì„Å∞„Å£„Å¶! I'm really hoping travel Japan summer holiday hope guys good job üòã someone number risk factors listed CDC, I'm getting rather tired people presuming know quality life life expectancy operate assumption going kick bucket soon anyways. hard take personally assure that, without COVID, 10-15 years left also docs wrong person's prognosis (I supposed wheelchair 20 years ago I'm even close needing one yet). pre-existing conditions COVID one's quality life longevity infinitely complex making be. Also, we're still human beings would prefer live 16 years not. usually reply comments like feel compelled give pushback. 

Anyone says college supposed best years life either prodigiously functional, given silver spoon life, lying teeth. ten years younger thought way do, believing squandering college experiences going result lifetime regret. really want connect dots, notion peak happiness early adulthood capitalist KoolAid. 

There plenty opportunities life get wasted, party hard, make dumb decisions. Nobody expected fucking monk graduate. Dad mode over. need go large events, stores.

That's I'm hoping turn Lmao due respect dude, got full semester half college pandemic. know it‚Äôs supposed like. know much fun having. 

This right SHELL that. Good answer. intentional sensationalist headline otherwise reasonable subjective answer.

Edit: misused word. bit more? ship sailed 100% blame. NYC regressed back 70-80s. It‚Äôs dump one wants visit % population, accounts population size

That indeed percentages work whole big data/machine learning side things really going fascinating impact last point - people can't really fathom today it, never mind we're likely five, ten years. doubt. Hopefully leading nations bind together help countries infrastructure money mass vaccinate quickly. commercials vaccines. next question might be, ""why commercials?"" need them. every news source covering vaccine CDC readily available information front center website. one going that. would worst PR ever. comment reminds french government 9000 IQ move opening everything except slopes. College overrated fuck. let media portrayals impact understanding average ""college experience"" ""Significant degree normality"" Settle every one. Thank god put dumb scare tactic behind us. always 99% going case. People already wash fruits vegetables? Ah see. guess would population size, know. 

Israel much smaller (about 9 million people, slightly larger population NYC), whereas US roughly 330+ million across 50 states. offer incentives population small, would guess resulting numbers easier justify get population vaccinated quickly.

Compared US would take much much longer vaccinate many people, may harder offer incentives without significant portion people deciding flaunt guidelines avoid vaccine, making problem worse faster vaccines help it. scientists expressed surprise even disbelief investigations, first patient's contact history supply chain Huanan market sought, apparently already performed Professor Maureen Miller, infectious disease epidemiologist Columbia University, said: **""It's implausible research done.** realistic, given world-class scientists there, technology invested last 20 years. sophisticated, understand transmission pathways, working years.""

Since Jan. last year, convinced virus originated one China's 20k wildlife farms. Wildlife farms promoted CCP high-value industry increase rural living standards. likely Chinese know farm came from, since high-ranking cadres tend get involved business ventures, went cover-up prevent loss face. probably deal people involved internally rather wash dirty linen public.

For rest world satisfactory state affaires, that's China works. 80 year old Canadians vs 20 year old Americans. 

We'll think remotely close that. absolutely zero pragmatic moral argument giving away vaccines we're vaccine supply constrained still phase I. phase high risk age, health, vocation. we're point sufficient immunity cases low enough even infectious strain move needle much hope that‚Äôs meant satire would need select random sampling deaths review individual medical records family history. sampled COVID death would get estimated years life remaining could averaged across entire sample set. I‚Äôve never laughed people getting virus, don‚Äôt mistake internet trolls representative general population Canada.

There‚Äôs restrictions lockdown BC. still go restaurants, etc. USA also 100,000 deaths thsn population country... better late never guess. calculate cost-benefit *NOVEL* virus potentially evolve *SPACE-BORNE AIDS* eradicate it? done really, amount praise put key workers part first batch Uh huh also remember said children high schoolers could get vaccinated fall? Well changed 2022. Man changes directions every day üòÇ That's median fatality age, average, based Europe (in US bit lower; countries vastly lower). Based age distributions we'd expect average age death much lower median. It‚Äôs nice finally feel like we‚Äôre making progress. passive aggressive way word that. ways keep pod safe still remain close contact them, depends entirely situation. fired life God compare happening right Star Wars, think Battle Endor ROTJ. Right now, Death Star core destroyed Lando Wedge way Death Star. Measles didn‚Äôt kill 500k people last year, 460 yesterday. Outstanding. state still working 65+, neighboring state 75+. course, health-care provider vaccines anyway. see math? job tell isn‚Äôt safe. knows everyone follow guidelines, he‚Äôs putting info there. personally would risk killing older relatives hug them, like keeping stuff. agree, Oxford lost lot integrity eyes issues data quality. Back efficacy new first broke controversy half dose/full dose vs 2 full doses... never understood way emphasis fact half dose regimen include anyone age 55. Like, feel like fact highlighted way discussing whether dosing schedule intentional not. seems shady tried spotlight half-dose regimen without revealing age demographics. vaccination rate finally 15% (Reuters) - Sweden carried record number new coronavirus tests last week 1.2% coming back positive, health agency said Tuesday, lowest rate since pandemic began time countries across Europe seeing surges infections. Sweden avoided lockdown instead emphasized personal responsibility, social distancing good hygiene bid slow rather eradicate disease deemed stay. ‚ÄúThe purpose approach people understand need follow recommendations guidelines exist,‚Äù Swedish Health Agency Director-General Johan Carlson told news conference. I'm going keep playing Devil's advocate. People die COVID overwhelmingly past age average life-expectancy. What's years one's life younger people deal decades reduced quality-of-life (and possibly shortened life expectancy)? way calculate total years lost instead people? way calculate net reduction life quality? bad that‚Äôs nations head infection disease thinks.  Remember someone said would go away warm weather. wonder putz happy you. idea I'll get vaccinated I'll probably cry joyous relief. evidence another pandemic. mean, 1) evidence spreading human human, 2) 8 workers sickened got better. like something aware of, hopefully cull birds plant. ""Very likely safe"" = dont know.

Do go doctors best guesses now, xan expect run studies give us informed answer? surprised. Yes, freak, once-in-a-century event justifies existence EU. Great reasoning. would get vaccines? market countries... like every small country Earth. 

Just curiosity, finish high school? heard thinking margin? We're great right now, partially Western Europe America intentionally fucked transition that's topic another time. mean joining EU make us worse future. Think second swallowing talking points reddit got heavily downvoted saying month ago. already 40 - 45% population infected point. Herd immunity 60% 90% depending week speak Fauci. 66% OK! experts predict January decline? 


He say ""herd immunity."" said virus gone. That's actually importantly different concept lot ways experts would happy explain you, inclined listen them. Bloomberg use CDC data numbers different unless CDC methodolgy changes. Ummmmmmmm, ok. I‚Äôm hoping Biden closes borders Russia till information this. ""less 1% refused"" Ah, mistake. stand point mixed age households. correlation, correlates populations hardest hit. Seems early? might earlier known. makes worried institutions keep clinging Covid restrictions distancing sheer bureaucratic inertia, long past point measures actually justified.

This best way phrasing concerns I've ever seen. fall crowd ""it's government wanting control!11!1"" fear society continue restrictions/masking we've year. year long time. Bureaucratic inertia perfect way describe it. turns COVID-19 truly seasonal virus. peaks saw March illusion simply virus getting started time natural seasonal peak ending. peak summer illusion virus finally reaching critical mass seasonal low. November December true peaks. almost like UK best scientists world know vaccines. math works 50 person spreads 50 people.

No, used overall average death rate (averaged across demographics) people person 50 spread virus to, rather death rate people 50. like cold temperature prevents spread directly though. See: meat packing plants good news. on, might expect hospitalizations/deaths continue fall, even infections not.

&amp;#x200B;

The important metric going forward infections longer reliably leader indicator. Thought 1% decline cases Cool. get it. trying share joy. Thanks keeping sub alive. sub kept alive! Really. Sending good vibes NYC. agree. People need calm variants. going cause big problems US. actual RCTs showing Pfizer effective variants compared AZ? people actually comparing lab studies done Pfizer actual RCTs AZ? Also: 1-2 weeks death reporting (depends location)

Protection fast, takes long time actually see reported numbers. Everything see reported today actually happened quite time ago. school is. Abbotsford's climate basically like Seattle Portland's. Wet winters daily highs 45-50¬∫ range Nov-Feb. Meanwhile norcal local mass site 30+ appointment slots open rest today, likely many remain unfilled. think would surprised fast would unscrew them. almost like young people spread it.

Anyway, I'm teacher students back person Monday. There‚Äôs ~17.2 million vaccinations far, apparently half Pfizer rest AstraZeneca vaccine. 

The SA variant places now, UK variant (B117) still far dominant appears going stay way. AZ effective appearing reduce transmission well, still used alongside Pfizer. would argue young people (like 15-30) actually better spread much anti-vax shit. worst people aged 35-60. People really know use internet (and especially Facebook).. Kind obvious weau domain name. know coronavirus subreddit, but, anyone else see news Russia? new bird flu? really can't shake fear we're head new pandemic anyone understands situation better, I'd love told I'm wrong :(  big thing masks. mean things closed worse thing it‚Äôs certainty, need masks thing past end summer don‚Äôt want cycle start fall. guy 1 million unlucky. Son stories kidney damage, strokes etc downright ridiculous. simply borne published statistics. math works 50 person spreads 50 people.

This hunch, area poorer people hit harder. Also, Latino population, traditionally common live grandparents. Young people taking risks feel like big deal get it, plus many asymptomatic. trend people, either poverty cultural tradition, likely older people living younger people. names websites models ""several institutions"" recommend better accuracy projections cover 109 days February 12 June 1, 2021? Thanks  Yea that‚Äôs 60% greater said. don‚Äôt even attempt estimate 60-100 million cases never confirmed. Jesus.

It‚Äôs super spreaders.

They still chance spread. nation people, don‚Äôt want that. spread means potential continuing deaths faster evolution new strains. lot schools, 3 months left. things going open right away everywhere, Part time used meet minimum threshold ‚Äúsafety‚Äù, makes mean less time class.

It‚Äôs better keep kids staff way staff get vax, schools better prepare safety. Sounds like good reason close parties clubs. know waiters don‚Äôt get tipped takeout right? wait staff job willing work? think vaccines people allowed opt person dangerous work they‚Äôre worried bot :) correct we'd wearing masks flu season, since **both highly contagious, deadly 40**

Then come absolute counts flu deaths much lower I‚Äôm hoping Monday snow melts quickly, although vaccine supply probably still going Well, extremely old fragile people account extremely high portion covid deaths. 1/3 people died covid US nursing home want prevent many covid deaths possible, vaccinating nursing home residents first clear best option. lift line

Being outdoors hugely lessens risk. keeping little extra distance standing line lift

I doubt people share lift randoms times. Heck, Swedes rarely normally either. vast majority lifts, least I've skiing, two-people anchor lodge restrooms

That risk, sure. Hopefully people smart enough least bring food eat home, reduce time spent indoors. doubt significantly riskful whatever would home anyway. Good. hopefully people protected much earlier. Wanting something true make true.

I suggest actually look [actual instead sharing feelings

Not even reaching herd immunity threshold 3 months scenarios. even reach herd immunity, mean virus gone. It'll still take months actually die out.

All experts agree late summer, early fall realistic end game. He'll change plan, recall nothing it. That's noisy small portion california electorate real threat him. I‚Äôm trying political here. explaining timeline someone probably seen stimulus yet. need governor change plan, dozen times already. Yeah say, young adult, SUPER bumming many age group saying continue life post-vaccine. Either I'm way locked been, they're way overreacting risk COVID, especially vaccine. Eh revel downvotes. provided Catholic response got votes Reddit places. Take W. realize 10,000,000 ~3% ? beginning February since then, lot evidence 1 dose gives adequate protection least 3 months. talking infection transmission. referring world tour, sold stadium type events, think see lot smaller, mainly outdoor type concerts happening summer. ~7 days first dose significant protection infection mRNA vaccines

~5 days infection onset

10-40 days infection hospitalization

2-6 weeks infection death (the high end happens quality hospital care) Bible says tempt fate, lmao. 

In tale Jesus devil, told Jesus jump building summary could simplified as,

""God redbull, give wings.""  join conspiracy theorist circlejerk? Yeah, mean what's baseline without pandemic? 10-20%? Meds conditions prescribed drugs. everyone suffering medicated. course year fairly normal people experience least anxiety depression. No. need make sure get haircut jab. won‚Äôt safe vaccine Pfizer? Yeah man, not. vaccine cases prevents infection. known become infected VACCINATED transmit virus. Also nowhere paper say prevents aysmptomatic transmission. least Europe, ones vaccinated ""regular"" elderly, extremely old fragile people, older 80 85, living care homes extremely fragile state. agree prioritize elderly questionable point this. several people close 70 still working essential roles doctors teachers, old enough ris group active full life ahead. Right, there‚Äôs need show documentation doesn‚Äôt show found anything significant. It‚Äôs waste time. Much like conversation stupid ass. Chortle means kind laugh Okay, I'm trying get understand insult use term learning disability (unless think LD something ashamed of) also issue make blanket statement Covid masks disproportionately affect people learning disabilities, because, matter fact, do. teacher who's trained work people LDs, also learning disability myself. Vaccinating population you‚Äôre committing genocide bare minimum. Canada currently track receive 4M doses Pfizer end Q1, 2M Moderna end Q1. haven‚Äôt shipments reduced all, actually Pfizer increased Q2, current approved/under-review would enough doses 65% Canadians receive doses end June. yes don‚Äôt think anyone advocates staying home next ten years. long case rates managed potential breakout spread managed, don‚Äôt see problem. 

The issue people lockdowns, masks, vaccines consider virus hoax putting straw men. end goal always ‚Äúopen‚Äù minimizing cost human life. look death rates back-of-the-envelope calculations still seems giving vaccines old people first prevent deaths. See comment possible reduces transmission, right point simply certain. question studied part clinical trials. there's certainty, whole point continue wearing masks everyone/a greater proportion personal network (family/friends/coworkers) vaccinated. COVID vaccine prevent infecting answer is, know. Clinical trials Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines found good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, trials measure whether person vaccinated less likely spread virus someone possible vaccines protect COVID-19 disease preventing person becoming infected first place. However, also possible vaccine protects person COVID-19 illness, prevent person becoming infected. words, vaccinated person may replicating virus nose throat even protected becoming mean enough virus nose throat infect someone else? necessarily. possible immune response triggered vaccine, protects becoming sick, also reduces amount virus nose throat point unlikely spread someone else. need research know bottom line? among first groups people get vaccinated, best continue wearing masks maintaining physical distance order protect others yet gotten Wendy‚Äôs makes appearance? forget testing July. terms real prevalence, we're probably well July peak. possible vaccinated person spread it, less likely, smaller viral load, within shorter timeframe. antibodies can't detected almost certainly immunity contribute herd immunity.  With....?? people want expert advice. like sister followed OBGYN's advice. asked family vaccinated pertussis want around newborn. bad thing parents active social life? They‚Äôre retired time world things. work full time I‚Äôm late 30s - I‚Äôm happy going every day. What‚Äôs point? $ power? Look dude thinking real control anything. Good point, already know likely get bad case covid serious comorbidities comorbidities would make likely problems left. I'd curious study controlled overall age health patients got covid. probs land hospital like car accident, could quite healthy every way prob got therefore better able recover. plenty 65's US trial started bit later. releases results (expected next month so) answers there. 


The issue Oxford group academics almost ethical phase 2/3 trials started younger people moving onto elderly people case reactions like. moving age groups quite cautious it. meant non-US trials biased towards younger people. 


In contrast Pfizer Moderna went straight jabbing loads old people phase 3, clearly paid obviously risk reactions different phase 1 2 trials younger people would've affected. 


This supposed issue US trial started couple months later unfortunately got significantly delayed FDA adverse reaction pushed data back further. 


I'm confident trial US reports results (hopefully soon!) queries people vaccine answered. fucking joking me? cant believe i'm living world. reality. mean, dreaming... think sniffles counts symptomatic. 

Here: actually name article fault. understand fear though. 
But scientific. I‚Äôll tell one thing personally...If forced I‚Äôd take chances COVID measles. moment. finish line, snapshot now. also experienced much higher death rate long period time.

Lots disinformation pushed Covid vaccines.

I‚Äôm sure exactly mean bad reactions flu like symptoms vaccines common sign working. data I‚Äôve seen nowhere close 100% though.

The future now. science fiction kid. quotes:

""A *Nature* survey shows many scientists expect virus causes COVID-19 become endemic, could pose less danger time.

If regions, aided vaccines, aimed similar zero-COVID strategy, could world hope rid virus?

It‚Äôs beautiful dream scientists think it‚Äôs improbable. January, *Nature* asked 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers virologists working coronavirus whether could eradicated. Almost 90% respondents think coronavirus become endemic ‚Äî meaning continue circulate pockets global population years come (see 'Endemic future').

&amp;#x200B;

But failure eradicate virus mean death, illness social isolation continue scales seen far. future depend heavily type immunity people acquire infection vaccination virus evolves. Influenza four human coronaviruses cause common colds also endemic: combination annual vaccines acquired immunity means societies tolerate seasonal deaths illnesses bring without requiring lockdowns, masks social distancing.

More one-third respondents *Nature*‚Äôs survey thought would possible eliminate SARS-CoV-2 regions continued circulate others. zero-COVID regions would continual risk disease outbreaks, could quenched quickly herd immunity people vaccinated. ‚ÄúI guess COVID eliminated countries, continuing (and maybe seasonal) risk reintroduction places vaccine coverage public-health measures good enough,‚Äù says Christopher Dye, epidemiologist University Oxford, UK.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let‚Äôs go low end say need 50% population either vaccinated gained immunity infection. think likely needs close 80% let‚Äôs optimistic. 

We population roughly 330 million. Half 165 million. currently 28 million confirmed cases, let‚Äôs super generous say antibodies robust enough fight virus. leaves us 137 million go. Currently vaccinated 11.5% population, 40 million people, that‚Äôs everyone least one shot. 97 million people needing either getting virus shot. would 1.4 million people per day. maxing 1.6 million shots given per day logically cut number half everyone getting two shots.

So, yay vaccines, governments *actively commit* path forward, yes, dismay name game.  I'd curious know Disney's stats. many people actually turned away. people act Covid. guess probably not, meaning tremendous amount effort cost putting temp checks completely worthless. EU invest least 75 million euros ($90 million) develop specialised tests identify variants, provide another 150 million euros boost research variants, EU executive said also pledged accelerate regulatory approvals upgraded vaccines work variants help ramp vaccine also adding anti-variant clauses new supply deals make sure companies develop shots work new variants, EU sources said. Yes, look total years life lost. recent study estimated 20.5 million years life lost due covid deaths 
If we're going consider years life lost, might also want look number years life lost due secondary effects pandemic. example, expected many millions people poorer countries die starvation result economic damage covid likely end many years life lost covid itself. weird logic. 

More people would die without lifeguards safety gear.

More people would die without building safety.

If ancestors underwent natural selection Black Death (Bubonic Plague) likely resistant COVID.

An *incredible* percentage population Western Europe died. whole, people survived greater resistance disease. 

The Bubonic Plague spread America‚Äôs (North, Central South), Iceland, Southern Africa. ancestors there, didn‚Äôt get genetic benefit plague (but also didn‚Äôt suffer horribly).

Not countering anything else said here! Unequal response horrible. adding little something discussion. 

Hope helps!

(Recently learned Black Death started China. spread west, significant effect society, wars, seemingly everything. Worth time review.) hope stop shaking hands. always thought gross, best thing pandemic (always looking bright side) shake anybody's hand year. ;)

Will happy hug extended family, though. blessed received vaccine! Amazing stuff, wish everyone access though, especially places like south africa. Im meant getting astra zeneca 3 month gap doses. Would literally pay pfizer shot instead. helped breathe easier. Thank you.

Honestly surprised news stories new diseases trigger pit fear stomach rest life, right, probably get used it. decision 100% guaranteed kill people, people need stop supporting this. priority right actually die COVID: elderly, obese, diabetics, etc. vaccine supply limited, vaccination zero sum game.

I‚Äôm pro vax, severe hesitancy.

A friend Canada helped it.
Someone already jab works/lives vulnerable community high hesitancy rates due good reasons.

Look well known source fake news related article related ""after"" his, parroting yellow Syria denies procured Russian vaccines via Israel part swap United States, ""winter surge"" actually like slow-building, long-term tsumani. Beginning late September, R(t) creeped 1 stayed around 1.05-1.25 almost four months.  that's exponential growth works: longer let run, bigger generation gets. 

But. 


Imagine similar curve except week, remove 2% susceptible population immunity (mostly vaccination, little bit infection).   


The US would seen slow-ish growth September-October, peaking 1/4th winter wave actually peaked, declines November December even holidays. 


That's powerful mass vaccination program is.  almost impossible imagine fourth wave resembling first three United States, unless escape variant emerges moots mRNA vaccines ways variant far. Pretty messed I‚Äôm 27 already fully vaccinated. idea got chance kinda fell lap. false though? Cases dropped even nearly close 95%  It‚Äôs almost like vaccines work something ü§î fired replaced. Sorry, thanks. I‚Äôm ditching mask soon vaccines widely available anyone wants one, there‚Äôs damn thing anyone it. actually reported providers. Per cdc. Fuck fearmongering clickbait titles. generally people miserable *before* Covid. Social distancing isolation easier already living way. know really good news, also can't help thinking 4.2% got Covid despite getting vaccine. guess another reason going totally back normal vaccine widely available. someone gain pushing anti-vax sentiment here? genuine concern? trolling? Wanting watch world burn? People far rabbit hole?

Like understand people making personal choice vaccinated (I agree it, personal choice personal choice). people run around internet spewing anti vax stuff....i understand. maybe give people much benefit doubt lol talking about? I'm telling right completely dodging every post. told indefensible lie clear goalposts. since that's become perfectly clear, seem want avoid mistake, hiding behind vague generalities insist right I'm wrong posts repeatedly refuse even acknowledge I'm saying even said I'm calling out.

 exactly think said could somehow undone months? 

I expect answer, expect continue declare victory without actually concretely engaging way, I'd happy did. data change fact result Phase III trials. data presented. take 3 months kick in, couple weeks like Vaccines delay initial booster better outcomes. prevent hospitalisations death. It‚Äôs okay take Advil vaccine side effects right? trying tough worried might screw immune response. feeling truly awful couldn‚Äôt take anymore took couple - honestly I‚Äôm little worried feel basically completely normal. know inflammation side effects immune system working, kinda worried shut down.

The coronavirus vaccine rollout full flight UK, Vaccine Minister, Nadhim Zahawi, revealed Government's target vaccinate 15m vulnerable people UK first dose Covid-19 vaccine met Feb 14.

As Feb 19, 17,247,442 million people UK least one Covid vaccine since programme launched - amounting approximately one five adults - 604,885 received second dose.

Almost 90 per cent people aged 80 vaccinated England. Vaccinations begun priority groups three four, includes 70s - 5.6 million people - people listed clinically extremely vulnerable.

On Feb 5, emerged England Wales hoping vaccinated over-50s early May. 

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine two jabs currently rotation UK, doses developed Moderna, approved Jan 8, expected arrive spring. New results Feb 2 showed single dose Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine prevents two-thirds Covid transmissions, raising hopes easing restrictions Easter.

Sixty million doses Novavax jab secured UK, Mr Zahawi injected part trial, shown 89.3 per cent effective preventing coronavirus participants.

How AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine work?
The vaccine ‚Äì called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ‚Äì uses harmless, weakened version common virus causes colds chimpanzees.

Researchers already used technology produce vaccines number pathogens including flu, Zika Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). virus genetically modified impossible grow humans.

Scientists transferred genetic instructions coronavirus's specific ""spike protein"" ‚Äì needs invade cells ‚Äì vaccine.

When vaccine enters cells inside body, uses genetic code produce surface spike protein coronavirus. induces immune response, priming immune system attack coronavirus infects body.

How effective it?
Oxford University AstraZeneca ‚Äì British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical company headquarters Cambridge ‚Äì announced jab effective preventing many people getting ill shown work different age groups, including elderly.

Partial immunity Sars-Cov-2 detected approximately 22 days administration first dose, MHRA reported.

Data published Lancet early December showed vaccine 62 per cent effective preventing Covid-19 among group 4,440 people given two standard doses vaccine, compared 4,455 people given placebo drug. overall Lancet data, peer-reviewed, set full results clinical trials 20,000 people.

Among people given placebo drug, 10 admitted hospital coronavirus, including two severe Covid-19 resulted one death. However, among receiving vaccine, hospital admissions severe cases. combined analysis dosing regimens resulted average efficacy 70.4 per cent.

According new results, single dose Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine prevents two-thirds Covid transmissions, raising hopes easing restrictions Easter.

The data, released Feb 2, also revealed first jab prevents 100 per cent hospitalisations 22 days immune response time develop. 

The study found single dose 76 per cent effective fending infection 22 days 90 days post-injection, rising 82.4 per cent second dose stage. 

In major vindication government policy, study also found vaccine effective overall second dose delayed 28 days 90 days. 

Is effective new variants?
Data highly contagious Covid-19 variant identified England suggest AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccines less effective it.

‚ÄúWe data UK variant. doesn‚Äôt suggest less well protected vaccine,‚Äù said Wei Shen Lim, chair Covid-19 Immunisation Britain‚Äôs Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation, Jan 13.

The Oxford University researchers developed jab say similar efficacy variant compared original Covid-19 strain tested against.

Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator Oxford vaccine trial, said new data suggests ""the vaccine protects original pandemic virus, also protects novel variant, B.1.1.7"".

But research revealed Oxford vaccine ""provides minimal protection"" mild disease caused variant Covid-19 first discovered South Africa, according early data small trial.

A study suggested Oxford vaccine 10 per cent effective variant.

The study, South Africa's University Witwatersrand Oxford University, analysed E484K mutation 2,000 people, young healthy. 

The team found vaccine ""substantially reduced"" efficacy South African variant compared original strain Sars-Cov-2. 

South African authorities suspended country's vaccination programme Monday 8 Feb following discovery, stating research needed. 

Professor Salim Abdool Karim, leader South Africa's Covid response, said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want end situation vaccinate million people two million people vaccine may effective preventing hospitalisation severe disease.""

However, scientists advising World Health Organization warned jumping conclusions actually awarded emergency-use licenses two versions Oxford-AstraZeneca jab Monday 15 February.

Many experts pointed study South African variant small. looked whether vaccine prevents mild moderate disease group mostly young people, look whether vaccine prevents severe disease, hospitalisation deaths.

Sarah Gilbert, professor vaccinology University Oxford, told BBC confident vaccine would prevent severe illness.

However, tweaked Oxford vaccine cope new coronavirus variants circulating Britain trialled coming months rolled autumn, scientists said. World Health Organization looks set approve Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine use developing countries.

Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech said vaccines effective new variants coronavirus discovered Britain South Africa, slightly less protective variant South Africa, may adept dodging antibodies bloodstream.

As precaution, Moderna begun developing new form vaccine could used booster shot variant South Africa.

It also announced Feb 5 UK Government struck deal German drugs firm CureVac 50million doses vaccine designed beat future variants.

How rollout going?
The Oxford vaccine rollout began Jan 4 Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's Churchill Hospital.

The government met goal offer vaccine everyone top four priority groups Feb 15. light success, government hopes offer coronavirus vaccine over-50s early May.

As Feb 19, 17,247,442 people UK least one dose vaccine 604,885 received two doses. 

Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi announced Feb 4 opening 39 new vaccine sites 62 pharmacy-led sites make ""vaccinating vulnerable even quicker even simpler"".

There 89 large vaccination centres 194 sites run high street pharmacies, along 1,000 GP-led surgeries 250 hospital hubs across country administering vaccines.


What Germany said vaccine?
The vaccine approved adults EU Jan 29.

This news follows draft recommendation Germany‚Äôs vaccine authorities called use restricted aged 18 64.

‚ÄúThere currently insufficient data assess effectiveness vaccine 65 years age,‚Äù Standing Vaccine Commission (Stiko) Robert Koch Institute, Germany‚Äôs main centre disease control, said.

The German recommendation issued independent panel doctors scientists, released detailed figures back findings.

They conclude vaccine ineffective older people, clinical trials simply included enough test subjects aged 65 provide reliable data. first dose* believe fully vaccinated people somewhere around 5% think miscommunication lol.

I wasn‚Äôt suggesting said benefit vaccination, u directed mis trust towards plan one people backing planned rollout he‚Äôs bit behind subject aerosols right?

My point doctor don‚Äôt need trust CHO plan much faith doctor, explained do, wasn‚Äôt measure benefit all, measure trust help decide.

I may understood either, don‚Äôt quite understand don‚Äôt trust?

The CHOs opinions don‚Äôt really factor decision vaccinate, opinions change reacts doesn‚Äôt react vaccine.
The fact PM, likely prominent politicians health advisors near future, taking jab publicly serves one purpose only, improve confidence it‚Äôs safe, much change course pandemic cause rely hindsight that.

Look, lot trust issues too, please don‚Äôt take dig, I‚Äôm trying understand coming from.

I didn‚Äôt trust anyone would take seriously enough take risks associated preventative action, terrified me, gonna lie.
Then take preventative action, despite initial announcements won‚Äôt, are, one countries havnt engulfed continuing large scale outbreaks daily deaths thousands.
They made mistakes, fixed them, made mistakes, fixed them.

I can‚Äôt find trust anyone this, even I‚Äôm medically scientifically trained. work trust quickly realised one person proven without doubt trust, understanding still risk getting help determine biggest risk is, CHO doesn‚Äôt factor all. don‚Äôt know him, hasn‚Äôt spent near 40 years proving best interest priority.
To me, he‚Äôs pretty embellishment demonstration could help others don‚Äôt doctor trust strongly do, decide see ge doesn‚Äôt develop severe reaction, PM whoever else gets wheeled demonstration. It‚Äôs trust them, it‚Äôs seeing live results safety.
If person trust gets takes jab change perceive demonstration? Probably much didn‚Äôt say needed dedicated circuit. that's case fall mass despair give I'm sure vaccine contributed greatly reduction, fair, drastic increase definitely factors play well (e.g. partial lockdowns? less gathering? something else?). all, we're seeing huge reductions lot places far lower vaccination rates well. example, California dropped \~6,000 cases yesterday peak \~61,500 day back mid December. represents drop 90%+ ""only"" 13.4% receiving least one dose... refrain next wave ""a Category 5, higher."" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Absolutely. teachers unions funded campaign, knows happen crosses them.

""Restrictions remained place oldest youngest, groups deemed highest risk."" **Pardon?** One year house arrest nation's children completely incorrect assesment children high risk?? vaccine intramuscular injection, unlikely produce true sterilizing immunity. virus enters nose mucosal surfaces nose would need neutralizing antibodies immediately kill virus. Instead antibodies circulating blood systemically primed immune system T-cells corner upper respiratory tract easily deal it. exposed likely infected viral replication shedding happen stops.

See example paper intranasal vaccine candidate claims produce sterilizing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted urgent need effective preventive vaccination reduce burden spread severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) humans. Intranasal vaccination attractive strategy prevent COVID-19 nasal mucosa represents first-line barrier SARS-CoV-2 entry viral spread lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development rapidly progressing, current intramuscular vaccines designed elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, show AdCOVID, intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding receptor binding domain (RBD) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits strong focused immune response RBD induction mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies CD4+ CD8+ cells Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, promotes concomitant systemic local mucosal immunity, represents promising COVID-19 vaccine thing systemic reaction IM injection still good. neutralizing antibodies blood IM injection also going allow virus ""go"" anywhere block access lungs, kidneys, heart, etc. It'll cornered upper respiratory tract systemic immune response able deal it.

But technically IM injections prevent infection, mitigate extent infections asymptomatic short likely transmit (and know household attack rate asymptomatic infections less 10% asymptomatic rate, blocking symptoms greatly reduce transmission).

The vaccine hoax, also perfect. probably block initial infection all, reduces severity 95% transmission 90% that's enough end pandemic. Spoiler alert: won‚Äôt major regional hub airports countries like LAX SFO JFK EWR. combined population Norway Finland less LA alone. Finland Norway good job, especially considering Sweden allowing virus run wild. comparison major diverse population centers like Germany, California New York. Yes, and? started place 12 months ago.

That, plus week first time numbers less stagnated, probably due UK variant becoming present also UK isn‚Äôt experiencing results nearly impressive right despite nearly at-risk groups vaccinated. Seems like they‚Äôre mainly using AZ dramatically less effective, especially seniors. mexico invaded US? Israel democracy middle east reached objectives countries don't. Israel best ! propaganda health care system one massive lie mean, Germany still much better overall death rate (my area like 4 times death rate Germany has...) Also argument Israel ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù illegally years

Really? Germany 80+. US starts reopening number vaccines near 3% like it. xyz cut line mask off. Pretty much preventable, don‚Äôt think die young it. say that‚Äôs you‚Äôre saying. hope governments (since doubt citizens will) give people chance live. know someone put 54 year old man hypertension front said ‚Äúyou store pickup things really don‚Äôt need, get food go, can‚Äôt throw parties another two months vaccinate... guy suffocate death next three weeks.‚Äù would exceedingly easy choice. know others might situations make difficult one, especially economically impacted, I‚Äôd hope generally could hold little bit longer.

Your comment:

""Not counting Mexico, course"" anybody scientific background talks. trying evasive. Well that‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm sure said start thing PCR 0.8% could wrong. knew immediatelly 99+% people 70 want vaccine probably english see else could mean ( wouldnt, modern vaccine worse corona plague 10% death rate plus 20% post covid complications groups high chance catching it, unless stay home months). Older people actually telling remember kids polio even smallpox know important necessary prevent catching diseases. Urghhhh sorry, auto mod deleting good comparisons :( gonna use kitchen analogies comparisons!

So Chemotherapy essentially said - it‚Äôs essentially like taking potato know germs - baking entire thing. You‚Äôre essentially cooking entire thing, hopes get rid bad germs. that‚Äôs right dime! (For in-depth insight - cancer cells reproduce. chemotherapy does, poisons entire body stops cell reproduction - cells. people tend lower white blood cells - hits immune system reproduction too).

Surgery/radiation much targeted - it‚Äôs essentially know bad germs - like dropped lovely potato ground specific area. know bottom potato unclean, always chop bottom - aka surgery/radiation. (For in-depth - often radiation oncologists - target specific locations body radiation, hopes ‚Äúburning out‚Äù bad cells).

With immunotherapy, want turn natural defenses on. It‚Äôs exactly said (can‚Äôt say exact words otherwise automod deletes), thing I‚Äôd say instead going quietly, you‚Äôre actually screaming S.A. immunotherapies work fashion - first example, would like telling S.A cell wearing red green cap (showing cell hiding normal cell telling immune system go hiding cells). second example, would like pointing S.A. specific cell (when target bio marker, you‚Äôre telling immune system cells bad cells). final example increased immune system activity, would like telling S.A. look bad cells - increased vigilance Immune system general.

I hope helps :) happy talk it! Apologies it‚Äôs little unclear, automod keeps deleting I‚Äôm happy continue try clarify clear ‚Äúblame‚Äù China anti China. beautiful country would like visit day.

Further traced Yunnan SEA, Wuhan probably first amplifier. mom dad anti-vaxers; know I'll hug again. :-( there‚Äôs freaks want shit continue forever don‚Äôt know do. Right now, Hawaii sufficiently small number cases practical contact trace all, quite effective keeping total case count down. per-capita basis, Hawaii lowest case rate US state.

The aim testing detect every single imported case, reduce number level overwhelm contract tracing system. coming CONUS, would agree would largely pointless - Hawaii screening large majority imported cases (even can't get all) makes lot sense. Huh, knew sounded No, restrictions they're high risk. said, giving vaccine people 65-70 much better return investment plus people generally active therefore risk community. You‚Äôre giving vaccine someone extend life &lt;5 years could giving vaccine someone equally high risk group extend life years. 

In Germany, ton people died right getting vaccine. Why? literally deathbed. Meanwhile, otherwise healthy people 60‚Äôs 70‚Äôs dropping like flies eliminating COVID deaths general apparently important reducing number unnecessary deaths. I‚Äôm sure people suddenly/unexpectedly lost parents grandparents thrilled someone hospice die pneumonia instead COVID. anyone else sick people telling us yet? shit brought worst people, don‚Äôt think going back. it‚Äôs amazing country collapsed.

So immune system always cancer cells - you‚Äôre aware it, body always hunt cancer cells. cells detected, body try eliminate cancer detected. Cancers try avoid detection creating proteins mimic normal body - immune cells see ‚Äúdisguised cancer‚Äù cells, pass ignore it.

Immunotherapy (antibody based therapies) upcoming field therapy within field oncology. ton ways target cancers - first which, target systems protecting cancer cell. example would research Dr. Patz Duke med, target CFH, protein protects cancer option, create specific antibodies type cancer. example, one type upcoming treatment saw, creation targeted vaccines. lab would take cells cancer patient, find specific bio markers, create vaccine bio markers cancer patient. mRNA vaccines, speeds process dramatically creating vaccine.

So conclusion - there‚Äôs ton ways stimulate immune system cancer! One would help immune system target ‚Äúcell mimics‚Äù. Another target specific biomarkers. I‚Äôve even seen research activates immune system more. case specific questions - use mRNA introduce cancer cell proteins immune system, create targeted antibodies.

So far nothing good news effectiveness vaccines much reduce spread, given. Check r/ireland reactions announcement, made last Thursday 9:55 pm exclusive interview taoiseach tabloid, see ... vast majority people support this, still compliant. Yea NYC US superspreader. I'm bit confused this, honestly. [CDC clearly states kids carry COVID-19, spread also vaccine yet approved kids... vaccinating teachers well good, opening schools stage seems like would cause significant new vector spreading disease. missing? Maybe changing standards help. way it‚Äôs set now, teachers teaching pass test. probably moratorium standardized tests years anyway since things messed right now.

Just one group parents doesn‚Äôt want bring kids back school shouldn‚Äôt mean everyone suffer. agree districts still keep distance learning program place children vaccinated. time, there‚Äôs really reason keep schools closed anymore teachers vaccinated.

Why masks help stop spread Covid everywhere except schools? makes sense me. I‚Äôve heard argument that, ‚ÄúChildren can‚Äôt expected keep masks on!‚Äù response is, ‚ÄúMake expectation children follow.‚Äù Fighting tolerated schools. Drugs tolerated either. children moving vehicle expectation wear seatbelts. children unwilling wear mask school get sent home, exceptions. hard that?

If school districts set strict mask usage standard, schools re-open safety teachers general would held high regard essential workers. Keeping schools closed lose-lose situation result anger resentment hard-working teachers. can't get PDFs open.

Anyone thinks gambling wicked virus better option getting new-ish vaccine, SO. FUCKING. STUPID. virus started spreading Germany Nov last year. countries Europe spreading February last year. That's 9 months later. Italy, France others hitting huge amount cases deaths, Germany practically unscathed. Germany began huge amount testing countries hit able completely delay it. 

The reason suggested Western countries simply *don't* epidemiological challenges. mention, data accuracy integrity. 22.30% Germany obese. 4.70% South Korea. Germany 21.4% older 65. South Korea 15.1%. Iceland, Japan, New Zealand easily close control borders. Germany surrounded infected Countries huge infection rates. matters anyway, talking waves. talk waves, context adjacent countries.

Western countries transparent data integrity built law, increases accuracy reporting, mention democratic resulting accountability. Countries like Russia admitted lying case/death rate almost 6 times worse reported. countries simply resources test infrastructure monitor accurately report. Countries like Peru Bolivia look like fine paper, excess deaths roof obviously way off. I'm even getting dynamics logistics economic network. 

We know headline meant. simply meant, Germany better everyone else. not. know arguing. even read article? start pandemic, Germany showed global leader dealing once-in-a-century public heath crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel forged consensus lockdown. government‚Äôs testing tracing tools envy European neighbors. country‚Äôs death infection rates among lowest European Union. health care stellar. generally trustful population abided restrictions relatively muted grumbling. more. virus‚Äôs second wave, Germany finds swamped like everyone else. one thought point?

They‚Äôre refuting rightfully seen one 20 year old woman ICU vent eventually recovered ... flu. seen many many young patients covid ... yes believe. sarcastic. truth quote picked pure speculation based real data.

It‚Äôs probably balancing act. know breakthrough infections happen 2 doses, means possibility developing resistant strain. break infections happen 1 dose. could slow spread disease vaccinating 2x many people could also reduce chance breakthrough infections reducing total incidence population. Well, works me. Better diluted bat piss IPA. mean first link contained multiple studies school districts exactly that, let science stop anything.

Thanks. believe locations pretty good vaccine centres we‚Äôve staffed lot. question supply now. Scotland said 400,000 week target back January, 450,000 week supplies slowed. Thats mass vaccination sites fully open yet. 

If get major supplies AZ Pfizer there‚Äôs reason UK can‚Äôt keep topping daily weekly vaccine records. demand/uptake probably one highest. Please note data Wisconsin. Monday morning quarterbacking, strawman argument actually, vaccines worked well. hadn't, what? Complain due diligence make sure safe? mean. still dang headlines aren‚Äôt like made grab attention something. really isn't. reach similar effectiveness Pfizer, need much longer period doses ( time still get infected). Furthermore protection new variants also looks inferior. that's without mentioning lack data 65+. Schools barely even pay teachers often falling apart. think enforce nice swampland I'd like sell you.

Ah ok, source ONS 6,000 people.

Of course, plan best-case-scenarios-only thats very, unlikely probable caught guard. probably makes sense approve Novavax and/or J&amp;J doses ready otherwise even iffy.

J&amp;J 66% effective iirc, single dose easy store. iffy? also really effective preventing hospitalization death COVID. key objective COVID vaccine even overall efficacy slightly lower competitors keeping people dying disease hospital end goal. COVID vaccine likely ever 100% effective stop getting disease all. prevent serious symptoms (which does) keep hospital that's win.

Just based alone. way get approved. Warp speed willing approve vaccine 50% effectiveness. That's desperate were. 

Imagine there's alternative universe Pfizer Moderna vaccines flopped left AstraZeneca J&amp;J. I'm grateful universe cause would problematic turn events. still could end pandemic vaccines would take lot longer. People realize lucky 2 vaccines 90% effective. could easily gone way. Choosing approve couple vaccines little ""iffy"" wrong approach. Yes, worldometer global charts massively dropping. global. Yup! lots people don‚Äôt want ‚Äúlab rats‚Äù aren‚Äôt getting (in US anyway). getting Astra Zeneca? South African variant UK yet? Well it‚Äôs strictest Canada execution point view, stricter US. Underrated observation.

Up go! Wow feel sorry Europe. Universities open essential activity ton peoples lives. I'm tired people acting like bars restaurants thing effected. Say want Pfizer but....that one hell vaccine! ice bad weather people driving get tested. Masks obscure face. Yep.

But interact strangers, usually within conversation. typical conversation hear person's tone voice even analyze body language realtime. Masks pose problem least decent emotional intelligence.

Children, though? sure, still lot learn. Actually virus decide ended already.

We wait vaccines work long term evolution stop many RNA viruses known often mutate different kinds quasispecies might find way immune evasion antiviral selection pressure increasing immunity.

However covid vaccination least able make significantly better advantage immune system already know least variant covid fight variants.

But sell fur shot bear. can't know. Many scientists actually think covid become endemic virus. think way.

""In January, *Nature* asked 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers virologists working coronavirus whether could eradicated. Almost 90% respondents think coronavirus become endemic ‚Äî meaning continue circulate pockets global population years come (see 'Endemic future').""

‚ÄúEradicating virus right world lot like trying plan construction stepping-stone pathway Moon. It‚Äôs unrealistic,‚Äù says Michael Osterholm, epidemiologist University Minnesota Minneapolis.

But failure eradicate virus mean death, illness social isolation continue scales seen far. future depend heavily type immunity people acquire infection vaccination virus evolves. Influenza four human coronaviruses cause common colds also endemic: combination annual vaccines acquired immunity means societies tolerate seasonal deaths illnesses bring without requiring lockdowns, masks social virus increasing selection pressure""

Interview Richard Neher University Basel evolution really see justifiably call lockdowns ""deal devil"". US coming half million COVID deaths, that's rigorous mitigation efforts. Could imagine death toll would seeing taken action? Yes, tanked economy, would rather tens millions deaths? spent 7 months last year unemployed due COVID, would never think trade loss income deaths countrymen. thing is, time, economy come back life. people died pandemic never will.

But harder pill swallow every American 100% board COVID mitigation efforts start, would've able effectively flatten curve even possible could've enjoyed months end practically cases we've seen places Australia South Korea. could've reality. no, unfortunately society selfish.

And sure, government poor job helping offset loss income, that's separate argument negate merits lockdowns own. frustration leadership issue completely justified.

My point FDR comparison lot people would've disagreed many negatively affected, going war right decision alternative worse. think controversial say done lockdowns letting bodies stack streets would've worse temporary economic distress we're currently seeing. right thing hope next time deadly global pandemic like one. Population ‚Äúdecimated‚Äù??? We‚Äôve 500k covid deaths country 350 million!! deaths elderly would died within next year two anyway. Obesity heart disease way bigger killers longer term COVID! Americans would hiding houses COVID truly great risk. 

Seriously, troll?? believe headlines, invest time spend reading headlines reading fewer, full, articles instead. almost like shut millions people out, gave zero assistance, said can't see anyone try take stress...... company sell them. Read damn article importantly, they'll die catch it.

I'm sure believe significant number vaccine refusers strong opinions it. know personal risk high, care much protecting people. old, apply. Well... strictest Canadian standards.

And people wonder can‚Äôt control pandemic I'm New England bigger yearly festivals apparently happening year, pushed back month normal dates. think I'm going comfortable attending anything year. that's coming someone worked semi-pro musician shit. I'm really interested playing indoor gig aaaany time soon. Maybe outdoors gigs feel okay...

Really yearning day meet friends, beer listen live music. hard get real-life data UK time soon. much first wave vaccines dealt Pfizer, AZ starting approach 40-50% total date. 

Given rapid rate vaccination quite soon over-take Pfizer #1 most-used, Pfizer coming March Moderna April, AZ still approx 50-65% doses. going take months collate significant data given overall volume administered, downward trend infections generally, fact takes 3 weeks vaccine efficacy.

A study Stanford found 10% people natural covid antibodies. September 2020, really entirely fall winter surge, much higher case counts before. 

Therefore safe assume min 15% max 25% Americans (Feb 2021) natural antibodies. people, likely 65 group. means could already 50% high 75% risk people least covid antibodies.

I feel like world's leading economies collectively reach 80% - 95% risk people level antibodies (vaccine natural) case counts deaths plummet, barring deadly variants.

But seems scientists keep saying even notice declines due vaccines reach 60 - 70% people vaccinated.

Certainly China! 1950s, France became major supplier warplanes Israel, relations two countries deteriorated Six-Day War, France declared arms embargo Israel. Consequently, Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) significantly increased aircraft weapons production (initially based French models) ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚ÄùIsrael switched United States principal supplier military aircraft.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù one introduced vaccine block EU

Your dispute AstraZeneca EU UK Lol true always said source relatively low risk usually issue unless community cases sky high. also definitely poor benefit risk ratio close schools considering downsides children remote learning months. 

If look Spain's data daily new cases dropped significantly despite schools open so... CDC right along. also says Spain heavy restrictions indoor dining bars etc would explain schools become main source cases everything else restricted year hell know, I‚Äôve US many times. Actually large stores makes easier administer large population example country live, Netherlands. city built ‚Äúcovid-center‚Äù scratch facilitate testing vaccines, took weeks probably lots money set up. lend support hypothesis many people asymptomatic infections previously assumed. factor vaccinations prior confirmed infections, well holiday infections (decline area started 2 weeks January, NYE bump). I'm assuming US? Article UK british helped secure isreal ww2. Securing land jews homeland ww2 people (Palestine) prob happy british took land gave jews. Im thinking thats arabs pissed. 1948 see this. Mainly west started coming grabbing oil land. anyone Czechia? Im looking covid numbers wondering going there, sad see many infections deaths. restrictions? plan start vaccines? 

Just wondering, sending wishes health. sounds like eugenics First shot majority cases (e.g. like parents case) please aware that. Whilst great yet need mindful fact biggest test case world moment going one shot stretching time second shot try maximise number one shot. Several medical journals Lancet questioned approach. Stores like pharmacies. You‚Äôre getting shot janitor. therefore protection.

Most protection. second increase protection much, provides longevity. mean, still disinfect groceries, wash hands handling anything outside, long takeout prepared front satisfied PPE cook, precautions, fine. Cooks super careful hygiene is, even covid give customers food poisoning, really think that's danger; Unless see maskless sweaty cook sneezing food, things OK.

On hand, set basket groceries, walked away waiting line, cashier looked sweaty exhausted glassy eyes, looked really sick.

I'm attentive handle cash, food again, instance. change gloves, separate person ""dirty"" contact, food preparation? see cashier unavertedly wiping eyes, I'm there. can‚Äôt find anything matter anyone help I‚Äôd appreciate it. Lost sense smell also went hell far feeling like shit...got test felt like smell coming back back...got results day later smell come back fully. Positive result news 24 hours test time frame feel 1000x better full sense smell now.....what mean? still contagoeious. anyone help/has insight couple details believe Novavax expecting UK approval soon. finished UK trial around three weeks ago although suppose reason 'rush' position deliver vaccines.

Like AZ, Novavax manufactured UK make big difference production running properly. WTF comments saying headline confusing poorly written. crystal clear me! can't churn vacine production lines like battle ships beyond me. measures devolved, decided governments respective states. 
Unfortunately so, think Angela Merkel made quite clear consider individual states measures sufficient. 
Neither I, expect Laschet (I‚Äòm NRW) mumbling something ‚Äûnobody could known‚Äú 6 weeks. Again. 

That part depressing.  Lie. delayed 2 days. voted conservative life, agree blind tribalism. GQP come Jesus moment honesty integrity. spurn extremist, conspiracy theorists white supremacist. lump together. understand silence complicity means. vaccines delayed **merely 2 days** families who's sons held captivity Gaza Hamas appealed supreme court, took 2 days dismiss delay, Israel allows transfer first COVID vaccine doses Israel preventing Palestinians getting vaccines. Stop spreading misinformation.

The vaccines delayed **merely 2 days** families who's sons held captivity Gaza Hamas appealed supreme court, took 2 days dismiss delay, Israel allows transfer first COVID vaccine doses likely confusing 23andme number states percentile vs others 23andme users. Remember September! Thank you. Instead calling dumbass like guy said. Also around time would expect like large groups large in-person events like concerts start happening. know people business told going later gut tells going hastily set events starting June July timeframe. We'll see happens. also preventing Palestinians Gaza receive vaccines 

That's lie. vaccines delayed **merely 2 days** families who's sons held captivity Gaza Hamas appealed supreme court, took 2 days dismiss delay, Israel allows transfer first COVID vaccine doses blockade blocking weapons shipments Hamas terrorist organization, food medical equipment. Lifting blockade prove deadly many Israeli civilians given Hamas long history target killing them. Societies rapidly converging towards automated detection every human action.

But America, previous administration set nothing vaccinations. guy isnt even power anymore still fucking over. put town (or nearest city you) tells much people walking, driving, taking mass transit versus pre-pandemic baseline.

I see state mass transit -36%, driving -5%, walking +17%

Yes. matter rethorical efforts articles like politicians make hide it, fact Pfizer/BioNTech reduces risk ~95%, i.e. 20 times, one ~66%, i.e. 3 times. difference individual risk huge (close order magnitude). that's ""second-rate"" definition, know is.

Firstly, peer-reviewed published data shows efficacy much higher 60%. Secondly, efficacy surrounding mild/moderate symptoms - runny nose sore throat. What's important stopping severe fatal disease AZ vaccine levels comparable vaccines. Well - vaccination programme ahead partly decision delay second dose. speed things massively - especially delays coming soon Pfizer (albeit short delay). last information told expect short slow next weeks change tack likely represents new information.

What could be? 

This probably represents expected massive speed delivery dose: Pfizer short delay, must rapidly increasing dose delivery, we're also due Moderna arriving guess confirmed doses arriving. AZ steadily increasing doses also novavax point MHRA approved yet - maybe they're drop? (There's also movement relaxing -70¬∞C freezer requirements Pfizer could become whole lot easier give.)

Lockdowns suck. really hate wanna able run around see friends. I'm fully vaccinated, intend go fucking nuts. I'm willing wait little longer everyone else around safe unvaccinated kids family? may right, mathematical modeling - decrease cases witnessing would predicted around 55% population immunity. think agree somewhere 30-55% population it. see arguments wanting think 30% it, personally, based evidence I've read we're currently witnessing case counts hospitalizations/deaths, believe closer upper end. No, article references study. letter opinion piece - absolutely asks reasonable questions way definitive. I'm open seeing happens cannot give equal weightage Nope. illustrating well US fares flu vaccination rates compared rest world. loads data says great vaccines. worry overly cautious messaging bad people deciding get vaccine. need better public messaging ‚Äúyou probably hug you‚Äôre vaccinated.‚Äù Like not, majority American families probably already hug adult kids without vaccines. need tell prevent hospitalizations death almost completely get everyone back normal. hear think ‚Äúnothing change, risk getting new vaccine.‚Äù 

I worried underselling vaccine end driving spread overselling it. Everyone dies eventually, ""prevent deaths cost"" can't policy framework. Yes, increasing longevity _one_ good goal public policy, one, extreme measures increase longevity drawbacks.

So no, lockdowns necessarily mean callous care people. means recognized maximizing life expectancy variable weighing. Ok issue data much vaccine reduces transmission. theory hard data yet. however data shows vaccines highly effective reducing server covid death that's countries going moment. drop cases another 93% state finally enter yellow start get back normal! I'm guessing severely depends quantify ""depression"". know definition is.

But yes right course. Feeling beat shit less hopeful hurt whole thing, losing faith human beings - might textbook definition, lot 33% world feels way felt way last year. health secretary, Matt Hancock , said brakes put roadmap reopening unexpected events throw UK‚Äôs recovery course, citing Kent variant moment pandemic forced change approach. prime minister set roadmap Monday reopening economy society, expected start English schools returning 8 March loosening restrictions social contact would allow two people meet outside. plan reopening, expected run 50 pages contain detailed economic public health justifications measure, signed Boris Johnson small group ministers Covid-S (Covid strategy) meeting 11am Sunday. 95% unheard came out. 99% preventing severe disease death, disease, 14 days second dose, 7, makes sense it'd bit higher Pfizer study. see proper source, I'm going immediately discredit trust study, regardless twittersphere abuzz with, someone tell study was. -4 top boot yay Who's telling UK blocking exports? That's untrue.

When say EU supplying half world, assume referring private companies registered within EU, private companies contracts country abiding contracts. EU supplying anything, interfering private companies would dodgy ground, even contract negotiation total fuck up. I'm 31 received first Pfizer dose Wednesday. I'm considered group 6 asthma. UK government response covid dire early on. I'm really impressed vaccine rollout. vaccination centre impressive, too. queueing, everything set enforce social distancing, one way system. know people 40 offered vaccine last two weeks. Patient: experiencing X.

Doctor: cannot find diagnoseable issue bill X.

Doctor: head. 

Patient: ;\_; That‚Äôs horrible number general population. That‚Äôs like 10 plane crashes everday saying ‚Äú98% flights land safely!‚Äù Sure, that‚Äôs technically correct. apply large enough group, it‚Äôs disastrous. low spoons use lot freezer food - reading transmission cold areas I'll always wash hands putting food oven, worth risk 20 seconds Good news. evidence Super Bowl spike. Many crowd vaccinated health care workers free passes. rest screened entrance dogs. one take it. Better nothing others say. mean miss opportunity throw dung AZ botched trial. going interesting see people who've formed powerful bond masks react building wave ending mandates next couple months cases plummet vaccines roll out. 

I predict therapists hands full coaxing people behind masks years come. agree first world problems. Obviously many people world care things mentioned like going restaurant traveling, cannot without pandemic. Still, perfectly normal human behavior care things used to.

Exploratory analyses showed vaccine efficacy single standard dose vaccine day 22 day 90 vaccination 76¬∑0% (59¬∑3‚Äì85¬∑9). modelling analysis indicated protection wane initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels maintained period minimal waning day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0¬∑66 [95% CI 0¬∑59‚Äì0¬∑74]). participants received two standard doses, second dose, efficacy higher longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81¬∑3% [95% CI 60¬∑3‚Äì91¬∑2] ‚â•12 weeks) short interval (vaccine efficacy 55¬∑1% [33¬∑0‚Äì69¬∑9] &lt;6 weeks). observations supported immunogenicity data showed binding antibody responses two-fold higher interval 12 weeks compared interval less 6 weeks aged 18‚Äì55 years (GMR 2¬∑32 [2¬∑01‚Äì2¬∑68]).

That's lot trust put people even know already much powerful position. best interest mind? ‚ÄúUK:‚Äù title

If it‚Äôs American nobody cares /s 

Here's thinking natural immunity vaccines can't really explain current drop:

1. dropping like crazy even places smaller percentages population previously infected (San Francisco, Canada);
2. STILL see previously harder-hit places higher rates less-hard hit places. Like, zip code poorer zip codes New York City previously hit hardest STILL getting cases per capita rich zip codes far fewer people previously infected. clearly factors besides percentage population immune swamping immunity effects.
3. vaccination even close high enough explain 1&amp;2.

The OBVIOUS reason drops cases peaks changes human behavior. happened world peaks. Daily stories ""record deaths"" spurs changes behavior governments individuals. Please quote said ‚Äúno jump mortality Sweden‚Äù? 

I think you‚Äôll find start acknowledged excess deaths said could accounted means. 

YOU one claimed abnormally large jump, clearly looking small graph source provided. offer larger graph data reference from, showed claim (and quote) ‚ÄúSweden‚Äôs numbers show abnormally large jump mortality 2020‚Äù.

Now please explain me.. given new data didn‚Äôt bother look through, comparing years 2019 (the lowest mortality rate year recent history) pretend it‚Äôs fair representation average year? 

People like fall media tricks easily. find clever way deliver information worst way possible morons fall every time.

. able get appointment eligibility two different things. work healthcare I‚Äôm getting mine week.  think might misunderstanding comment. agree everything go 100% back normal kids. certain areas country even adults elderly teachers vaccinated, still making kids wear face masks, areas going 100% normal. restrictions place well. back kids playing recess eating lunch together interacting. also social distancing forced stay desks, etc. That‚Äôs whole lot assumptions mind reading part. west coast show fucking mess still mean, kids want vaccine won‚Äôt able get 2021 colleagues vaccinated, enough masking schools. I
Thought science data? science shows virus serious kids. even close. Masking, me, damaging covid kids. support staff teachers vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* PP Canada think. wondering happened there. Clearly want share. 'Look, know months, everyone wants get vaccinated free. that's enough. stay home, watch netflix destroy mental financial health!' Guaranteed people sub wearing masks long vaccinated. Good 'Old EU. degree hit elderly everywhere. NY deaths per million 2400 vs average US 1550. nursing home debacle early probably worth 800 deaths per mill, probably 14 thousand deaths. significant probably 1.5x 5x current 20-year-old, I'm fine wearing mask public rest life. East Asia, see reason can't too. guys looked daily deaths COVID U.S. lately

it looks like it‚Äôs going really fast Put shit category seems main spreaders aged 25-40, wonder 50s done mid April focus group instead going downwards numerically. Maybe read article? It‚Äôs extra dose vials. No. Leaders talk reasonable outcome still allowing alternatives. likely scenario restrictions mostly gone July. months ago? working then? journal /u/TheScapeQuest said mentioned.

""Exploratory analyses showed vaccine efficacy single standard dose vaccine day 22 day 90 vaccination 76¬∑0%"" Oh talking effectiveness first shot said ""under 65"" that's addressed. embarrassing yourself. honest opinion done. think disconnect comes closely people actually going follow mask mandates 2022. won‚Äôt. 

Maybe will. would issue walking grocery store seeing elderly shoppers wearing masks. asked wear mask hospital healthcare setting. think probably good practice. let‚Äôs real - 2022 people going flood restaurants, weddings, 20 year olds going large gatherings won‚Äôt mask sight, OK. majority population protected - either natural infection vaccination - types mask less gatherings risk healthcare system. Man, can‚Äôt believe fast Biden got done! Man national treasure. Yeah, try tell doctors unable sign get dose. think tried? late So... variant twice infection rate, prevent vaccine, 10% mortality shows up, would reopen everything? Yooo Florida ya boy get bat? irresponsible downright rather horrible support indoor dining restaurant employees still can't vaccinated.

That's OPs problem. OP asked **HE** would safe. answer is: classist nasty say deserve go restaurants employees restaurants deserve safe.

I say that, dude. Israel doesn‚Äôt produce vaccine locally though. get EU manufacturing. seems mad me. I'm UK, available local surgery it. live city 600k, walk 10 mins visit one. 

you registered one surgery, pick one closest you. Canadian doctor here. Quite disappointed rollout feel there's internal external issues delays. wanted point us vaccinated. Many front line colleagues not. Many services quite understaffed front lines falling ill isolated. Many residents numerous interruptions delays burnout. ramping up, delay definitely detriment frontline. Canadian living US, understand comments also make bit sad. tables turned Canada leading charge vaccine front, actually think Canadians would priority recipients, government would also work help allies etc. Canada purchased large amount vaccines different companies, ordered large amount extras send countries can‚Äôt afford them. I‚Äôm glad see US gaining momentum vaccine distribution genuinely think things turn around soon hang bit longer. heart also hurts people like Grandma back home breast cancer twice aneurysm recently. cooped home (I know it‚Äôs story here) don‚Äôt even timeline could get vaccinated scary. Hopefully Canada get sorted. Got first dose moderna. drive 40 minutes away closest appointment get. emerging crisis? want people spamming around too? would suggest needs determined much vigorous study. pretty dire situations. also supply vaccines approved quickly trials done. US could miles better likely month. largely decide take vaccine, I'm going one dose j&amp;j whatever brand vaccine good one dose time I'm eligible called talked someone else. Neither seemed grouchy. second person talk said cancellation list. virus kills 87 years old, right? Honestly, planet on? toddlers died this, starts hitting hard age 45. mean? less exactly said. know sure. can't provide specifics. expecting say?

All say things improve time goes on, long people continue get vaccinnated practice good social distancing. frustrating Canada find way produce vaccines country yet. That's real blame lies. vulnerable position rely less countries producing medical supplies. glad US ramped getting people vaccinated. close ties, benefits Canadians neighbours vaccinated well. Oxford vaccine almost non effective South African version, there's least one case vaccine effective. J&amp;J notably less effective South African variant. Pfizer anticipates effectiveness, noted less antibody production. anticipated South African variant may increase chance reinfection, well, several seen already.

The variants risk vaccines targeted spike protein mostly major ones spike protein, including UK. lucky UK variant still seems escaped vaccine, may lucky mutates significantly can‚Äôt anything possibility variants people don‚Äôt get vaccinated. Neither reason reopen everything. You‚Äôre one saying ‚Äúno u‚Äù over. 

Anyway. 

I understand statistics. I‚Äôm giving information accurate. It‚Äôs kindness. 

*You‚Äôre welcome.*

And come much population 5-17. 18-49 (36k hospitalized) 50-64 (39k hospitalizations, btw). 0-4. one segment. lmfao don‚Äôt know. Many Canadians right seen pissed vaccine rollout. it'd nice people could get funding side patience Sure. responding ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt see anything wrong that‚Äù part comment. What? Never. 

Read title, check comments say form conclusion. Return monke expect someone posts ‚ÄúNo New Normal‚Äù essentially bordering denialism read articles go views? course didn‚Äôt. Yeah it‚Äôs ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù anything. People won‚Äôt problem quoting article though. pathetic. rate anyone Canada wait till 2022 get vaccinated I'm thinking June 1 date majority country, places going really start opening much sooner. move Tennessee April fully expect able whatever want I'm vaxxed  what's real number, then? Happy cake day! know number people justifiably point fragile, piecemeal confusing vaccination program US.

Plenty people fit criteria still struggling find dose. 

I sure could worse, logistics vaccinations far exemplary. US capabilities still roof another level. We‚Äôve made many bad decisions country overall, ability never went away. moon üöÄ wish lesson didn‚Äôt come economic disaster cost countless human lives. What's logical? Genetic mutations? Buddy basis life, already happened matter bad Eh. zero doubt canada one first get exported vaccines makes perfect sense export shortage. could copy paste entire comment replace ""vaccine"" ""mask"" would downvoted burned stake questioning science. We‚Äôll remember need water one day. know sentiment keeps getting repeated. ordinary timeline vaccine rollout mean anything. Someone gets rushed hospital ambulance, sit around musing good thing ride bicycle would taken 50 times longer. 

It stunning, luck. concerted, wartime, drop-what-you're-doing effort best minds world. example humans capable big things need doing. Stop feeling lucky start feeling proud great things accomplished. Interesting (and much helpful unexplained downvotes I'm getting). I'm curious definition comes from. obvious definition offer would receiving phone call letter asking want make appointment. there's less obvious official definition ""offer"" I've seen (but accept may missed it).

Even means ""1st dose given end July"" 12 week interval second dose still takes us towards end October. Slightly better, still means taking year. UK one going first doses cost second doses route? Canadian, agree. expect US send doses? Doubt manufactured would done same, we. incredibly immature. 

It *rate* hospitalization relevant factor rationing vaccines. know confusing much, calm reread discussion, might come understand. lovely thank mr redditor literally spends day, every day sub spreading misinformation AZ vaccine mysteriously pops *instantly* sputnik mentioned. Nothing odd behaviour all. You‚Äôre moron actually careful now?  depend. masks required hospitals: yes 
Will day every day like now: no. 
It‚Äôs nonsense think public going abide vaccine widespread.  It‚Äôs also nonsense think organizations like NBA going fold shop put another season 10% capacity. It‚Äôs also nonsense think you‚Äôre going mask police 15,000 people arena.  It‚Äôs also nonsense think governors keep states emergency hospitals aren‚Äôt risk. It‚Äôs nonsense operating suggestion everybody masking right is. 

He‚Äôs smart guy implies doesn‚Äôt mesh reality. world 55 million die every year virus average age death line life expectancy? Context important.

This make sense me.

Yeah, virus targetted older people more. mean go younger generations. victim young 1 year old, starts hitting hard around 45 guidance CDC immediately inauguration require reducing upper limit genetic material enhancing cycles, known CT. reduced false positive rate 70 plus percent back somewhere around 2%.

Fauchi warned noted CT inflation made average test go 35 cycles. results number garbage.

The really bad news there's lot people walking around thinking gotten recovered virus, false positive. Awesome, teachers Um people want proven vaccine seems readily available USA highly effective. rate entire USA done Pfizer continued ship rate could Canada 4 weeks (2 weeks everyone two weeks second shot). HOPE USA able keep mad highly efficient pace demand weans they‚Äôll slow rural left overs us. We‚Äôre literally waiting table scraps. English? attachment saw English take frustrations Americans. headline came Toronto. us exactly gloating here. think spot on. It‚Äôs always got confused ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù slogan taken right wing. I‚Äôve solid democrat forever, I‚Äôve always thought Americans come first - think functioning international relations really helpful Americans. resources scarce opportunity reserve Americans much good anywhere - course conserve resources. Put mask first that. Everything Israel propaganda politics. 

But sure Meanwhile NY, 90 year old grandpa able get appointment scheduled ü§ô Pfizer best make subreddit irrelevant 2022 order magnitude less people. yeah. like everyone's memory Democrats Republicans denying efficacy masks union one entire month March April last year disappeared. Even adjust population numbers outpace Canada greatly. in-laws going Florida again. third time since pandemic started. 60-65 age, great health, haven‚Äôt virus vaccine yet. point, shake head. don‚Äôt listen husband say, ‚ÄúThe rates good right now!!!‚Äù Um yeah, cuz there‚Äôs pandemic?

My father-in-law watches lot Fox News, haven‚Äôt taken virus seriously start. They‚Äôre also kinda impulsive. 

We live Midwest lots people go Florida winter usually, absolutely reason need go. don‚Äôt see in-laws much steer clear weeks they‚Äôve back... determined get virus avoided thus far. think people south africa think back euro crisis particular memories World Health virus cause COVID-19 spreads primarily droplets generated infected person coughs, sneezes speaks. also become infected touching contaminated surface touching eyes, nose mouth washing hands. protect yourself, keep least 1-metre distance others disinfect frequently-touched surfaces. Clean hands thoroughly often avoid touching eyes, mouth nose. think maybe speak different type English. wife STILL waiting. U.S. struggling catch stats like that. asymptomatic people still develop antibodies? they're taking ivermectin. wrong call 300 million+ people ""plague rats""?

lol American would support sending enough vaccines Canada cover 65+ population proceeding distribution US. exist.

Good people exist everywhere, upvote. Michael Golke stresses, he‚Äôs anti-vaxxer. could be? works nurse Berlin hospital profession 20 years, specializing intensive care. finds offensive politicians asking him.

  
I'm sorry refusing perfectly viable vaccine middle pandemic, based personal lack understanding vaccines work, anti-vaxxer. Nurses idiots too. They're virologists, even doctors. genocide that‚Äôs occurring within Palestine Israelis occupying land. information available using internet search engines. hope find resources you‚Äôre looking for! 

Be blessed. (Reuters) - U.S. infectious diseases official Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday possible Americans still wearing masks 2022, measures stop spread COVID-19 would increasingly relaxed vaccines administered. Fauci made comment interview CNN. stunningly bad communicator person position.

He know milions hang every word, yet still extremely casual glib information shares. Hugs lasting 500ms prohibited. calling americans ""plauge rats"" every day like definition word 'Schadenfreude'. article talks findings. According researchers behind study published PNAS last week, nearly half Indian population inherited 75,000-character-long DNA sequence Neanderthals believed reduce risk severe disease due Covid-19. Conducted researchers Okinawa Institute Science Technology Graduate University (OIST) Japan Max Planck Institute Evolutionary Biology Germany, study sought examine gene variant linked 22 per cent reduced risk severe Covid-19 ICU admissions another study conducted December. found variant identical one found three different Neanderthal July last year, study researchers Max Planck Institute Evolutionary Anthropology found piece human genome increases risk severe illness Covid-19 inherited Neanderthals 60,000 years ago. estimated 30 per cent South Asians believed carry gene sequence. people problem pattern recognition. people want excuse stop caring. Making fun care means end. ashamed weakness project shame anger derision. wrong. bought shit we're really entitled we're going past bad behavior. know happened Canadian negotiations wish well way thinking released Trumps hell makes better them. flashback fucking talking about? disingenuous best. Back last summer - everyone talking like end world. TF saying? would agree criticism cases lower here, literally cases deaths still uncontrolled infection rates. Yeah, think keep vaccinating first. I'd really like read effect school workplace rapid testing twice week.

Because spitting $2 paper card non-intrusive measure know.

Betting everything vaccine efficacy, low mutation rate bendable immune systems dumb, get us new lockdowns. Palestinians objectively enjoy better longer lives across border Egyptians. question remains.

What genocide? Still 90 thats great thing people die 50/60 whereas one took miles vaccine lol household still thing- groceries get disinfected, packages get wiped put quarantine. Wallets/phones etc exposed go UVC sterilizer. Person outside washes hands, removes clothes showers entering main house area.

I'm pretty sure person waiting government approval resume hugging. No, still making fun you. Yeah I'm (33m) Toronto friend around age got vaccinated scenario. Caught completely guard found remembered mom full time care made sense. vaccine efficacy 14 days second dose 66¬∑7% (95% CI 57¬∑4‚Äì74¬∑0), 84 (1¬∑0%) cases 8597 participants ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group 248 (2¬∑9%) 8581 participants control group""

""There 332 cases primary symptomatic COVID-19 occurring 14 days booster dose, 84 (1¬∑0%) 8597 participants ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group 248 (2¬∑9%) 8581 participants control group, overall efficacy 66¬∑7%""

I realize data vary studies depending measure, even 76%, still dramatic difference: 4x reduction risk vs. 20x.

As long-term protection, much known vaccine yet, there's reason expect Pfizer worse respect. long proven, think? greatly impact mask mandates. Yea I'm feeling great. state passed 1 million first doses 6 million people, risk gf dad vaccinated, sun setting 4:15, spring almost here.

So much hopeful about. tons 65+ population US still access vaccine Well guess positive news countries get right automatically disliked dismissed propaganda.

However; opinion valid anyone else thank you. never said that. feeling Biden administration applying promise-overdeliver this. Nc also triangle weird. Mostly minorities wearing mask go sticks white folks. weird Seeing you‚Äôve proven wrong multiple times, hope mods delete comment it‚Äôs misinformation. don‚Äôt think presumed super bowl spike anything people actual game rather watch parties normally happen Nope, drink coffee. Amen. I've pretty supportive restrictions far still restrictions whatsoever everyone offered vaccine, people (and shouldn't) follow them. Possible? Likely! Dang it, many citizens stupid saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fine.‚Äù Yes, now. Why? you‚Äôre one 400k + people dead. hard understand!!?! No, you‚Äôre wrong. ‚ÄúPreventing infection‚Äù referring asymptomatic transmission. Difference ‚Äúinfection‚Äù ‚Äúdisease.‚Äù understand cautious really contradict message vaccines effective, also say still infectious therefore need wear mask follow social distances. It‚Äôs huge leap people assume vaccines aren‚Äôt effective. Wait, mean vaccinated, can't carrier? kinda like Contagion vaccinated people tattoo barcode could scanned. B117 B1351 rise 

According Minister Health, proportion b117 daily new infections 22%. It‚Äôs almost US hasn‚Äôt finished vaccinating it‚Äôs citizens yet. Wonder wouldn‚Äôt want share. 

It‚Äôs amazing quick everyone calling US it‚Äôs citizens every name sun way pandemic handled. we‚Äôre bad guy aren‚Äôt giving vaccines away like candy apparently. guess I'm optimistic are? reason particular. Also, think big deal achieve 90%.

Perhaps I'm wrong though. Perhaps Brazil 'easily' achieve 90%. ‚ÄúOkay, but‚Äù

Sorry, two comments ago called ‚Äúmisleading dangerous.‚Äù you‚Äôre going continue conversation, admit wrong that.‚Äù post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Show one peer reviewed study long term side effects covid vaccines? No? course exist. 
Show one independent peer review released body motivated/affiliated pharmaceutical industry government? No? none.  Yep, soon signed defence production act Canada got short end stick EU USA. Quality allies friends over. feels like trying steal PPE early days. would think so. Pfizer Moderna vaccines similar. I‚Äôm American would support sending enough vaccines Canada cover 65+ population proceeding distribution US. exist. Please. isn‚Äôt faiR say ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt share,‚Äù maybe ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt yet.‚Äù US sends tons aid world, freaking time. vaccine, we‚Äôre vaccinating population first. What‚Äôs wrong that? cases deaths country. Doesn‚Äôt make sense focus vaccinating first? 

We‚Äôre vaccinating rate running out. isn‚Äôt like we‚Äôre sitting piles unused vaccines. phrase ‚Äúsemblance‚Äù ‚Äúdegree‚Äù normality infuriating. least specific it. Fucks sake Yep. still know infection prevention way find screen shot around like twice week. Preliminary, needs extension areas confirmation. 

I wonder human challenge trials ethical/warranted case. need scientists experiment quarantine. Good hear. getting vaccine 2 weeks so. won‚Äôt necessarily fine. also won‚Äôt necessarily fine flu, getting hit car, food served restaurant. It‚Äôs fair force others give non-invincibility. mortal an. live it. 

In specific matter covid, reasonable ask ppl mask covid still bigger risk others moment. That‚Äôs really great, ability release it! would really put lot minds ease. argument based saying 'muh' really need better argument. Lol even trying say sub turning Israeli propaganda page! 

How nice! You‚Äôre missing point. I‚Äôm saying contracting covid surfaces, possible, rare likely way catch covid. people disinfecting groceries wasting time Yeah. Unlike, say, Flat Earthers, rather self-contained group, anti vaxxers seem spread uncontrollably. would be, wonder. reason believe that? posts record cases get lot attention every week. actually realistic scenario one wants hear. would mean adults fully vaccinated end October would brilliant avoid another massive winter peak. Youa supposed wash fruit vegetables washed?  help remove bacteria, including E.coli,¬†from¬†the surface fruit vegetables.  bacteria be¬†in soil attached produce. Washing remove soil is, therefore, particularly important.  wash vegetables, wash under¬†a running tap and¬†rub water, example bowl fresh water. Start least soiled items first give final rinse.  loose produce particularly important tends soil attached pre-packaged fruit vegetables.  always advisable wash fruit vegetables eat ensure clean help remove bacteria outside.  cooking fruit vegetables also remove bacteria. don‚Äôt believe kind thing. people vaccinated wear masks (and that‚Äôs big if), shouldn‚Äôt punished bc people pretend they‚Äôre vaccinated.  Untill US still Mask up, take total care civilians... hype. better anyone else... Ya, um, we're talking Covid-19, actually knew search information specific Covid-19. Restaurants can‚Äôt afford stay open half capacity forever. barely afford now. Unless people ok spending $40 shitty plate nachos, btw one thing making divide haves have-nots even wider, they‚Äôre gonna get used sitting table less 6 feet away another. That's great. Sorry, still think Brazil (or country) 'easily' get 90%. There's 5g Israel, illusory correlation. know scientific variables   He'll hold record nearly minute done bastion masculinity opens mouth. dense? means windows isnt obvious fire code requirement. kids people received one doses

You add all. long gain function research since still dont know result gave us virus. Oh boy, [here's telling Dana Bash we'll still merely ""approaching degree normality"" end 2021, leaves door open mask-wearing 2022. Good luck convincing hesitant people get vaccinated messaging  kind stupidity continues blow mind. full year pandemic zero lessons learned. still averaging 75,000 cases per day - peak either first two waves. time reopen likely come soon, time now. know about, know I've reading myself....and according numerous sources I've looked morning, Covid-19 still considered transmissible via several different types surfaces. food? logical explanation that? OP might US. ""It's nice Christmas"" line sounds like UK me, I'm sure. ... failures America. learn make better tech, testing, this.... question... Things going improve quickly, people need patience. approve pending candidates everyone vaccinated summer (that‚Äôs adults want one) mean, seems pretty likely masks last thing go. late 2021/early 2022 seems like reasonable estimation are...are serious? even see high horse?

I hope never drive starbucks feel like getting coffee. UK we're pretty good job well, even EU tried stop us. 

The UK looking vaccinating adults July, I'm sure we'll send remaining vaccines overseas point. 

Hopefully UK/USA travel corridor we'll pretty much playing field summer.  making fun

lol. calling americans ""plauge rats"" every day sub

lalalalala accurately, mistaken. 

You‚Äôre welcome. source claims. Newsom going change 1 case per 100,000 criteria pretty soon state going still heavily restricted rest country back normal. ""propaganda"" article: published yesterday

""reality"" articles: published Jan 29th, Feb 1st, Feb 3rd. decisions made 3 weeks? C'mon now.. disingenuous Read almost comment. Or, like, google it. many quotes. Try reading them. Yes much hate admit Trump actually pretty good job pushing vaccines forward. think Biden continue may well get majority Americans vaccinated first hundred days. **will** gladly wait get mine Christmas... 2025 Plus seems like lots actual adults mental age 12 year old so? anti vaxxers protest outside bars restaurants they‚Äôre allowed enter ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è accept always risk life. regularly take kid see 100 year old grandma. demands it. risk kill her? Sure it‚Äôs worth relationship great grandchildren. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt shitty human. kept telling us would surges Christmas Dinner family never happen, still keep saying it. good happening! It‚Äôs raw memorization young age. Spanish think phonetically grammatically it‚Äôs superior English, gendered nouns ser/estar really decimate lead. England misfortune invaded multiple times people different language groups. governments across Canada can't seem stay focused one thing. they're trying ban airsoft guns im like ""just focus covid"" Looks like you‚Äôre one panicking here. doubt it. Democrats bad covid beginning. Trump banned travel China Pelosi photo ops China Town telling people come down. fool yourself, none care American people. incorrect. ‚ÄòDiaper‚Äô Donnie Chrump. Sorry think so. It‚Äôs still dumb require people wear mask isn‚Äôt necessary, people need wear mask.

Wearing mask big deal. Stop pretending it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt you. Yeah people want vaccine order travel can't get one? rest quote make answer better, headline less actuate. first wave: \~3% country immune 


After second wave: \~10% country immune 


Right now: 35% country immune, we're adding every day vaccinations. 


I understand concern, repeat seems unlikely. Maybe Cancer patient stay home then. child death many.

That not, never been, public health works. society would look *very* different. would hungry uninsured children. That's world live in. Pfizers press release usage world probably. talking white Justin blackface Justin? Either way, we're worse wear living Justin's Canada. wonder, ""long covid"" common severe, advocates resort sources quality? I'm sorry hear that. top list. Yeah, lied. manipulated information. said ‚ÄúI nudge bit‚Äù end trusting everything coming true. lot meant get take particular action. understand still lying. later say could high 90% btw. 

He‚Äôs turning guy responsible people getting vaccinated. keeps talk getting vaccinated really doesn‚Äôt improve quality life, it‚Äôs going flop. People won‚Äôt see real need everybody petrified covid.  exactly 22 year old going get vaccinated you‚Äôre still saying bars closed, masks on, choose sex make sure person you‚Äôre takes antigen test beforehand? going huge drop uptake won‚Äôt worth it. Possibly, nothing like dealing here, COVID discussion saying mask wearing continue indefinitely terrible.

I agree sick people careful going forward. incivility üõ° Basically yes. vaccinated people still get sick covid. people spread it. Fauci also says open season vaccines April. Johns Hopkin's says we'll heard immunity April. NYT says we'll still wearing masks next year? sounds like everybody wants prophet either give hope continue fear. right? (If them) article politics coronavirus-related aspects vaccines. Let‚Äôs here. I'm wearing mask forever, like privacy gives, also appreciate breathing less people's air transport, etc. think high standard expect public health officials honest us public health matters, regardless pressure. fact, ability tell us truth pressure instills trust government, rather doubt skepticism Fauci's lies caused. They'll probably mandatory quarantine allow personal leave afterwards. go home they're good fucking ready. bad, even better then! think there's increasing evidence first vaccine shot highly protective may actually benefits waiting longer three four weeks indicated clinical trials. definitely case start first shot wait several months. like booster. friend's parents surgens offered vaccine declined. Granted, live 3rd world country high curroption. said they're young also virus around september. really know much more. They're anti vaccination anything, just... 0 trust government. lol I've read challenge trials UK expose participants using droplets nose. know simulate actual transmission, got thinking. Since respiratory virus, someone still contract COVID injected actual virus particles? body deal direct blood infusion better exposure respiratory system? Fauci one examples people point need reform civil service. He‚Äôs politicized scientific organization, happened long covid, response aids crisis horrendous people protested outside office, going remembered fondly response covid either dust settles hero worship gone. wrong - changes tone lot well gets new information day kinds sources. go present today vs yesterday stuff. I'm ok masking good longer. wish could get big box stores like Walmart allow people without them, still though even law mandate place. Remember need two shots. 1.7 million day doesn‚Äôt mean 1.7 million fully vaccinated Please don't... want leave would solved global pandemic vaccine? personal sacrifice would solve it? economically capitalist, politically communist, said done, they‚Äôre autocracy. 

Pfizer would eff American people given economic opportunity someone offered more. agree post, still comes ‚Äúsucks poor‚Äù. last time Fauci got kind attention general public though? everyday people raise like god worship him.

I think ever kind following this. 1% albertans gotten 2nd dose. 1%. Can't wait get mine April.. 2022. Cross land. need negative test land crossing. hotel stay air travel. 

Proof vaccination currently accepted either. age group 14, flu killed children Covid last 13 despite fact Covid pandemic raging flu spread much suppressed..

So, no, evidence Covid significant danger children seasonal flu. EU done really good job constantly shitting Americans bad things though. masks pretty normal, i'm wearing one forever like people looking seriously tried like 20 different names found one taken. can't understand that's possible was. No^100

I vaccinated time 2025 Christmas driver was, caused run someone over.

And what, blame Chevy Tahoe drivers? Blame Chevy?

I get wanting know, past that, get good does. ONE child death many.

Okay theres like million Muslim kids bombed existence every year, go something don‚Äôt catch close someone 5 seconds That‚Äôs roughly take. Getting enough people vaccinated block transmission biggest thing.

I think you‚Äôre pessimistic ability go back normal life though. population vaccinated, spread drop near zero. point what‚Äôs protecting isn‚Äôt covid around, good vaccine is.

That‚Äôs sort makes laugh relative levels lockdown/worry. area locked hard March, one anything month so, almost covid around. absolutely could done things fine, didn‚Äôt know that.

Now there‚Äôs massively covid, I‚Äôm willing outside dining, limited inside opened up. Ok public appearances AIDS 80s 90s disqualifies criticism media whoring past months? Thanks reply. figured wasn‚Äôt necessary go aunt pushing get tested she‚Äôs making mom even paranoid already is. I‚Äôll tell F off. current problem Canada small market influence foreing vaccine producers. course wouldnt problem previous governments didnt kill domestic vaccine industry remember comes time vote. That's fly in. need negative test result cross via land, hotel quarantine. new information indicate needs last 2022? Cases trending vaccines trending up. Fauci sharing information making say may need mask 2022?

If legit reason beyond *Every COVID death preventable death* fine far seems like zero risk bullshit.

Turning life sterile risk free idea living. Ohhhhh okay understand now, thought city. Wishing luck regardless! Nobody promoting bullshit, 100% board vaccine well within facts Fauci saying others known. last day said new variant take months get working vaccine against. take one there, another another...is enough testing say someone take things stacked upon themselves? I've seen certainly nothing long term since approved. know many people concerned every right be. Mask - lets go back mass gatherings yet continue social distance let thing burn much possible. problem media doesn‚Äôt even really misrepresent Fauci says. Fauci insists living foot mouth. someone asks mask wearing going continue 2022 answer emphatic no. reason contextualize answer morning talk show. someone asks vaccines prevent transmission, answer ‚Äúwe assume do‚Äù that‚Äôs it. Fauci incapable answering questions. meant elderly people first group. point chaotic distribution hampered even vulnerable. 

Eventually supposed enough vaccine getting appointments won‚Äôt free currently. wonder would case previous administration charge. Fauci flip flopped times outright lied. Maybe he's worried public opinion need tv time telling everyone can't lives back. Ya know. sweat 500 mark hits balloon pops. wish get logged in. thats go. Failing New York Times... :( jury still connections COVID blood type/Rhesus factor, majority studies showing, like MANY illnesses, may play factor effects vary among different types. studies continue find reason believe such, see reason believe varying effects different ethnicities. absolutely agree statement, I'd say public opinion ""loose"" large part USA, yes, really wish exactly Australia (particularly Melbourne first broke out). This. don‚Äôt like Trump, administration deserves credit laser-focused developing eventually rolling vaccine. Justin Trudeau concerned virtue signaling securing vaccines Canadians. Instead working US various European countries, administration chose work Chinese company, deal fell through. Herd immunity medical experts say it. mirror: vaccine actually protect people dying SA variant? no, protecting dying vaccine's job. temporary fix. vaccine's job [end nightmare pandemic Read Derek Lowe‚Äôs blog Pipeline. Please. informed discussion scientific can‚Äôt pack outdoor stadiums full people wearing masks football baseball games? masks make everything ok allowed? There's probably correlation glass wearing socioeconomic status might confound results. one whiniest things I've ever read. 

I sincerely hope young still emotionally maturing. 

And no. Nope. anymore big deal walk around mask hat. nothing. Get grip. Ok. objectively funny. Hilarious!! Thank bringing levity this! public spat Larry Kramer AIDS crisis. 

History begin day born. doesn‚Äôt put comfort zone know won‚Äôt enforced won‚Äôt bother. part last year. that‚Äôs that. Sorry puts comfort zone LMAO Canada even Superbowl year, people even trying? guess understand people compelled constantly touch faces. Like, said touch face simply stopped unless washed hands used hand sanitizer. hard that?? ???

This literally trumps roll-out plan Oh good. cancels baldness thing base flu-reopening then?  know whether vaccines slow enough get Rt 1 inflection point. one seemed confident will. know this?

They slow enough get reproductive rate 1, seen evidence this? username American football team, old west livestock wranglering people?  would say vaccine nationalism problem either feds vaccine companies. Early Canada struck deals major vaccine manufacturers provide nine doses per Canadian. may overkill certainly covering bases. failed anticipate countries would hoard vaccine citizens. That's surprising even necessarily morally wrong, disappointing. mild Covid July, well son. water tastes salty, even coffee. son's sense taste permanently distorted foods intolerable smell... I‚Äôm US permanent resident lol. 

I‚Äôm happy great insurance selfish views. CDC update. 63.1m doses EU. Ireland, Germany, Serbia, Greece, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Norway Iceland (they might EU?). countries done much better. Also compare US EU (similar size, population), US worse least 1.5x terms deaths. Yeah, France weird. best health world, yet antivax homeopathy pseudosciences huge Colombian, I‚Äôm embarrassed. secured 50,000 vaccines last week entire government made huge deal it, ton photo ops, press runs, videos, first day 18 vaccines applied. 18. Thankfully week, secured another 192,000 vaccines vaccines starting applied quicker, there‚Äôs 50 million us think government secured 1.96 million vaccines total now. Sorry, good dead That‚Äôs going happen here. Masks associated negative memories COVID people would rather put behind them. would bring PTSD people. Lol, clearly don‚Äôt work construction industry. Building new state art production facility happen 6 months. You‚Äôd need least year planning, design coordination engineers, architects, scientists. Further, you‚Äôd need acquire production equipment extremely short supply production timelines. you‚Äôd year ago clear vaccine would possible within months outbreak occurring - previous vaccines taken years produce. somehow you‚Äôd need know exact sort production facility you‚Äôd need working vaccine even available.

In honesty, we‚Äôre great - we‚Äôre going country vaccinated next 6 months. production facility would finished timeline. Read article No, Canada bought every vaccine could soon could‚Äîif clear fact we've purchased enough inoculate population 5x over. first Moderna fourth Pfizer. beat Europe procuring vaccines manufactured there.  forget disabled poor. opening schools also disproportionately effects disabled poor. correlates. mean cause. nothing statistics. first comment, traveling US specifically get vaccine ridiculous allowed. sure turn complaining undocumented immigrants though. frequently work high risk jobs health insurance. anything, top list. Agreed way life, would also nice new normal people wear mask public cold flu. really big deal put mask crowded subway train, bus etc. years Asia get less sick productive society it. like wear everywhere like worst part pandemic. Reddit downvotes everyone saying this.

It totally understandable use vaccines produce first. stop trying silent everyone mentions it. news even like mention topic hated. That's correct. addressed concern correlation another factor entirely showed male pattern baldness. still imply causation. Hahahahahahahahahahaha what?

In November went ‚Äúquick lockdown save Christmas‚Äù lasts ever since, place go supermarket week. Don‚Äôt talk idea Complete sterilizing immunity necessary. matter people become infected mild symptoms disappear day two. matters serious illness requires healthcare and/or leads death, AZ vaccine almost 100% effective preventing this.

Complete sterilizing immunity overkill, especially comes 20x price increase massive increase difficulty handling, storage, preparation, increases risk errors. current mRNA vaccines poorly designed regard. AZ vaccine right: low cost, easy handle, appropriate level efficacy. best fit brief currently available vaccines. Whether it‚Äôs possible besides point. point it‚Äôs possible fauci doesn‚Äôt decide grandma dies not. still say single worst Costco Alhambra location LA County. 


The parking lot, alone, Mad Max shit. Nate Silver, flaws, come one rational nuanced blue checkmarks regarding covid? Better previous records infections, infections one day, deaths, least fucks given coronavirus. Glad see took 12 months change leadership get shit together. live MA. It‚Äôs rough gained lot respect state government. Even though Charlie Baker (governor) republican, he‚Äôs consistent, honest, hard working throughout whole ordeal. Interestingly, hasn‚Äôt vaccinated yet says 50% stage been, wants treated like constituents. genitals fall turn green. I'm even Canadian feel behalf downright shameful first-world country resources funds secure supplies let people bad Canada has

Especially never complete moron charge knee-capping efforts like last year also seems like we're getting good news regularly now, rather constant setback setback. really feel like science back wheel hope positivity go. school district live pushed back person learning 100% teachers. hand washing teachers saying, oh don‚Äôt like online schooling unions push gross. Go get union support getting kids back schools admit part problem. ally kids parents, stop pretending be. manage get vaccine year pretty cool true glasses wearing. likely every risk factor we've identified. Anyone else remember Canada mocked U.S. using defense-related claims ensure critical steel industry stayed viable U.S.? ""wE wOuLd NeVeR aTtAcK yOu"" - nobody said would, said things get tough need domestic capacity key areas.

Guess Canada's finally learning lesson. watched old SNL 2001 Chris Kattan playing Fauci. obviously well known enough 20 years ago parodied. 'Murica new studies vaccine efficacy determined begin partial immunity? know initial trial Pfizer pegged immunity starting around Day 12. stop spraying deadly virus ""A lot"" equal ""all"". 

Either outdoor gatherings ***some*** people wearing masks risky they're not. using India China example. Pepe Trump, one doctor spotlight people trusted. Biden, many doctors free speak minds. natural, popularity goes bit. ""Would like quiche?""

I'm USA even know ""competition"" moved Korea teach English Canadian co-workers obsession comparing Canada USA. Whereas many Canadians apparently view us archrival rivalry 99.9% Americans aware even exists, look Canada way Argentina, Denmark, Ireland, number countries, opponent contest, simply country people. case keep masks permanently part culture, covid ends basically replacing flu still ten times worse.

With said, vaccines 50% effective preventing transmission newer strains, stack 50% effective masks top that, enough mostly prevent transmission. step needs done making HVAC ventilation widespread imho side effects? never hear warnings like drugs...... Canadian, could definitely going smoother, important remember roughly 10% population united states, therefore entirely fair compare raw numbers. comparison percentage population, would much closer, even though Canada lagging behind. 2019: *flying Canada get life saving surgery*


2021: *flying U.S. get life saving vaccination*


Oh tables turned much obviously hate it. shame fuck them. Yep. Sure is. 

Same lost 5k vacation last spring people couldn‚Äôt stop going bar. 

Again, rejoin society stay home don‚Äôt feel sorry anyone losing trip won‚Äôt take vaccine, didn‚Äôt give shit lost trip couldn‚Äôt skip bar weekend last April.

We‚Äôve spent last year dealing anti vax, anti mask assholes who‚Äôve cost us year lives. 

Nobody cares don‚Äôt get take trip. trump effect Remember flatten curve much prefer WFH employer hoping get butts seat ASAP. social life outside office dont crave in-person bullshit way productive setting Jesus, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND dead still think it‚Äôs cold. 

That cold WW2. 

And couldn‚Äôt lift damned finger save life. selfishness outmatched ignorance. I'm worries mask mandates - I'm sure logic reason prevail sensationalism.

I'm pointing ridiculous people sub. Probably measles didn‚Äôt kill 500,000 Americans last year... favor letting India, China Mexico travel California cut fucking line get vaccine us U.S. citizens? must joking right? fair U.S. getting majority produced vaccines world cause shortage countries people want travel get vaccine, requiring outright forcing people able enjoy lives forcing ""shelter place"". difference immunocompromised people would risk level pre-covid, would forced shut-ins virus still circulating. would letting people take risks truly own. sadly, ever going case covid. either need get high level herd immunity, pushing risk onto others. level infections still high. premature reopening could another wave. Also CDC estimates 130 million Americans infected already. Add vaccinations covid lot fewer vectors continue transmission. Add fact seasonal good combo dramatic drop. highly doubt even small minority people changed behavior safe. theory makes sense. Biden laid plan return normalcy start month. seriously think we're going hit hundred million doses administered even says many it'll take remove capacity limits, fully open schools, give people businesses back, lift mask mandate.

Some days easier others. hardest feels like government interest ever going back, almost never talk treat optimistic scenario. get trying make best bad thing sometimes swear Fauci Biden actively enjoy current situation.

The United States one best vaccination efforts world. needs track run finish line returning 2019 normal. time start talking immediate future rather nebulous someday. becoming insufferable. think politicians, least US, aren‚Äôt getting useful kind control. Unless mask factory, there‚Äôs political financial benefit this. anything restrictions hurt profits companies whose lobbyists ones fund politicians campaigns influence them.

Amazon Walmart say hi. Nobody lobbying mom pop shops.

Years now, history look kindly Governors left small businesses die order benefit big corporations lockdowns.

The biggest transfer wealth happening right politicians lining pockets donations Amazon Walmarts' lobbysts. explicitly allowed encouraged California - be. pandemic, goal stop spread. Welllllll get point example bad. india china robust vaccine programs along vaccinating populations are. India's already 50 over, china's far behind. rich 80 year old tourist would come vaccinated probably chill out, steal dose want get vaccinated, relax get sick. want jab probably protect me. I'm looking efficacy rate least 90% feel comfortable. study multivariate analysis took account age variety factors ranging diabetes conditions. So, addressed concern. Nobody forcing anyone get it. 

They stay home shelter place. going enjoy lives. Prince William entered chat. Yes know people. contact longer. attitude toward vaccination also want hear hateful rhetoric. theory, young people contribute spread. vaccinating first limit spread older people, thus save lives.

Honestly one questions we'll able really answer history books.  pfizer AZ would brainer. AZ waiting several weeks pfizer would take AZ. turned vaccine fully expecting get AZ pfizer delivery morning got that. didnt care either way. ahh, agree. border close land, rich connected entering via Air. know happens someone gets half dozen COVID shots one evening?

A supervillain Marvel Phase 5? stop ignorance selfish? fair, know potential side-effects long-term. go couple years without negative side-effects shown (like say might harm fertility) fine. one forced get it, especially since like Ebola huge death rate, point people either vaccinated already gotten virus. Reminds $2m re-open it. expensive keep running.

The people farm said would start scratch lose work got closed. arguments made could self-sufficient need be, never explored. Clearly he'll surpass 100 days/100M doses. Good job making happen. What‚Äôs interesting USA high terms deaths per capita. think governments handled COVID really badly? realise different liquids different freezing points, right? Yeah always permission kill family year now, guess. Kind stupid way look it.

But now, vaccination, go back normal stop bragging endangering others lives pandemic. wipe groceries. glasses must protect too.

Really though, touch face without watching hands first. got second dose yesterday. Today feel like *hammered dogshit* happier Fauci loser  Yeah fair enough, don‚Äôt know enough specifics Canada didn‚Äôt do, know US sending extra vaccines can.

I‚Äôm going super critical politicians making bad bet, since literally bet, there‚Äôs many unknowns involved. guys deserve break. Thank everything. Ooh, defense attack username. Good job galaxy brain. well, yes no. masks filter air protect droplets. Well average/mean seemingly stand thing, though assumed average used way German, average literal translation Durchschnitt median Median I'm talking restaurant workers think get priority - documented not. 

I'm talking letting foreigners countries come U.S. getting vaccinated younger, general population due age factor. goes internal logic people Covid going die anyway longer dehumanize I'm going assume fake news! world poked fun us,

For anti-science thinking hoax. deserves criticism fundamentally anti-intellectual position take hugely damaging society large. America filled anti-science positions. deserves criticism society science commonly disregarded partisan politics. kind position always deserve criticism complaining getting American assistance vaccinations quickly they'd like.

That's obviously different issue. outside world cannot fix global warming denial COVID denial problems. could help vaccine production. Pfizer vaccine partially German, case forgot. unfortunately American vaccine nationalism disregards that.

Your post reeks self-righteous attitude.  Ooh charge = immune criticism. 

You aren‚Äôt smart, huh? I've fully vaccinated double mask public settings anti mask fervor great feel obligated change culture. know average person feels awkward wearing mask may well help change that. Plus, one knows I've vaccinated. actually worried contracting spreading, would still going stores like majority 2020. disagree 100%.

I going get covid. taking risks, precisely I've avoided getting sick since start.

When get vaccine, want able go back comfortable normal things, like eating inside restaurant going movie theater. J+J AZ would me.

Your 6 month timeline also off. U.S., likelihood, enough Pfizer/Moderna everyone wants June/July. earliest healthy young person like would offered vaccine, even one second-rate ones, April. really, make extra ~2 months. seems like no-brainer me. doubt really get people. It'll embolden ones already vote conservative mods really started perma banning people say shit like long time ago. ‚Äúnot real lockdown‚Äù crowd. *Science entered chat something say this* Sure, tend agree. Illegal immigrants jump pool greedy companies set up. correct! last time take food last February, let anyone cook since, like also considering loosening rule really want carl's jr, know, fast food workers able get vaccine county next week likely wait little longer. course they‚Äôre self-inflicted. top down/federalized response. get handle think outward aid. Canada would exactly shoe foot Guinea pig here, made modernas second jab symptoms, blegh like mild flu symptoms hangover A-OK, lasted little day. No, vaccine easiest precaution COVID. done part, saying home almost year, young kids growing memories anything normal/fun. 100 years ago Spanish Flu, beat stop wearing masks life returned normal. think people refuse return normal life really worse refused wear masks part take pandemic seriously. Yes, objectively pointless, big deal try compel others follow whims.

Masks good idea they're good idea - indoor spaces, close others, areas high infection rates. Outdoors among vaccinated people? Absurd. Oh say see... Tf happened sub? Seems like everybody hates Fauci now. Funny one blames Trudeau blatant screw this. place orders vaccine till August. much faith China would gift us needed...this worse ethic violations combined! Healthcare worker, starting see normalcy work since vaccinated. Locker room break room pretty much mask free us without fear. People feel like hide drink water. feel comfortable standing around again. I‚Äôm American living Bermuda Overseas Territory UK Boris Johnson ordered enough vaccine every resident here. vaccinating second phase group 50 older age group. I‚Äôve first jab already. back US I‚Äôd wait July likely. learn think virus behaves, don‚Äôt know couldn‚Äôt lab. know makes sound like crazy ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù. fully vaccinated told put mask on, even show vaccination card true. bad situation US, equally bad Europe. Reddit may make seem like Europeans adhering social distancing more, numbers paint different picture.

Imagine surprise finding even bigger group anti-vaxxers France US!

Many asian countries ones saluted efforts distancing/mask-wearing/etc.  love people show bluntly little know topic confidently commenting on. joking right? We've known virus transmit fomites almost year now. Idk...my link deleted automod maybe ended finding missing doses point last weeks definitely lot vaccines unaccounted for. Fauci discussing mass mask mandates, widespread lockdowns, large-scale stay-at-home orders late 2021. You‚Äôre overly dramatic. wait.. thought Canada good, US bad?? really really dumb headline. always hug family regardless virus vaccine. Fauci needs stop silly stuff. Actually, find it‚Äôs incredibly privileged never worried paychecks Canada celebrate awesome job done.

Again: CERB go? Big businesses ties government. Small businesses got smashed. continues way.

Meanwhile mental health toll living restrictions enormous. kids lost 1.5 years schooling. So, yeah.  Cerb good idea went way WeCharity. Ok yeah got me. I'm jealous America. big gulps? flavours Mountain Dew. 

Really unfair. unbelievable jealous wonderful lifestyles control people. Tell get dang vaccines there! great news. Ok ya agree that‚Äôs meant well intentioned it‚Äôs going happen worth every retch pain! grateful vaccinated. don‚Äôt facilities Canada make them. vaccine itself. EXPONENTIALLY far deaths Canada. gruff country that‚Äôs arguably hurting more?

IMO US‚Äô Covid problems self inflicted. Canada US saw outbreaks March virus east coasts, since countries taken different paths virus Canadians taken stronger line trying contain outbreak. time Canada quarter cases capita third deaths. 

It‚Äôs like alcoholic pushing way front liver transplant. dont care, Americans need take care America first. Canadian government take care fucking citizens. don‚Äôt owe shit they‚Äôve holier thou entire pandemic get fuck So, really looking set high percentage people must vaccinated sliver normalcy contemplated, regardless happens cases/hospitalizations/deaths, society/government/media decided there's level acceptable risk Covid.

And get vaccinated held hostage don't.

So, end. That's need know. Time fucking kill myself. Exponentially deaths? don‚Äôt think know word means. Boy, wonder people fleeing CA. unreasonably expensive live localities yet freedoms even basic civil liberties stripped name of... safety? Although, kind nonsense trend long prior pandemic. COVID accelerated deterioration brought public eye.

Like hell sitting looking Newsom cronies mayors San Francisco LA thinks themselves, ""yeah, right totally acceptable?"" think they're mask *mandates* people vaccinated. Continued voluntary mask wearing fine Property may cheap people businesses fail pandemic probably credit ratings trashed. Since credit ratings calculated private entities, incentive disregard pandemic timeframe. deal banks utilising said credit ratings loan determinations. states like Texas, Gulf coast region, parts west coast impacted natural disasters top COVID, starting new business pandemic could physically much harder. Oh nice, Canaan‚Äôs back! And... I'm disputing that, I'm angry Canadian governments US. vaccines available sure heck giving Americans Canadians Israelis, Palestinians, right? Anti-vaxxers using statements like promote bullshit. Fauci really lay off, especially knows media anything misrepresent statements clicks. Also Canadian doctor, working Quebec (also frontline / hospital care).

We received first dose beginning January, word yet second dose (delays 42 days us).

Vaccination pick coming weeks doses received.

I wish well, stay safe. tough year say least, like think worst behind us. guys laughing now, wait new variant pops makes vaccination efforts useless. good vaccinate world's population, US best interests honor promises allow vaccine export neighbors eradicate virus too. talking situations unlimited supply go around, imo be:

Healthcare workers directly dealing covid patients

Healthcare workers high risk covid exposure (respiratory therapists, ER doctors, ICU staff areas currently dealing outbreak)

Other healthcare workers

People age 60-80

People comorbidities (asthma, diabetes etc)

Teachers, grocery store employees, essential workers must deal public part job

The rest us Both?

There bunch vaccines there

China one

Russian one

BiNTech one

The US one. 

And others forget. question metrics counting, every day watch news give new metrics state, it‚Äôll say 15 people died today state Hospitalizations decreased 16. deaths count towards decrease hospitalizations? No, I'm saying that. agree you, I'm trying explain side's position. buy all. one banned red meat taxed it. Fools confused issue. Can't admit there's something science climate change might really thing? stir little religion whole lot entitlement, along ""no one going tell do"" mess. 

I'm old enough remember seat belt helmet laws passed. type people arms then. Trudeau brutal.

Ford also crap Ontario.

Our political parties Canada absolute garbage. Chrump mistakenly hired competent people. definitely due plan Chrump‚Äôs mouth. production capabilities decades. let grandma ride car bc chances get fatal car crash higher giving covid dying hug worry downvotes dismiss kid then. Take opportunity educate them. Take whoever made scared. know. guess people different bodies. want wait side effects reactions researched consider taking since I'm young person comfortable taking risk covid. virus transmit well fomites. chances getting covid touching something touching mucus membrane low. People sick Fauci unable stay consistent messaging. flip flops almost daily point seemingly evidence back up. declarations emergency? 100% America, land free(dom accountability) people can‚Äôt reason never able you‚Äôre saying wear masks forever. Don‚Äôt beat around bush Again, get source? sounds batshit crazy. That's excuse getting one. Plenty students skip grades elementary level too. Missing year nowhere near end world like people making be, cases still partially effective year online hybrid classes. According Reddit around time last year, Canada invented vaccine Americans going dependent save us COVID.. list, anywhere close top. Better let ride car Prof Peter Openshaw, member New Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme vaccine transmission data ""looking really good"", **but scientists still needed estimate much vaccine interrupted transmission.** thing all. Nazi‚Äôs didn‚Äôt even know going undesirables Wannsee conference January 1942. sure think US could done more. healthcare top line. It‚Äôs transparent, inefficient incredibly expensive. Yep. expect storms stop Texas gets back feet, it‚Äôs gonna go back 1.7 million day, JJ increase even more

(In last week it‚Äôs 1.3 million, things considered that‚Äôs pretty good) There's shortage Canadians assigning blame various entities thread Canada want try little reading. I'll give non-Canadian's perspective. 

Canada purchased lot vaccines. Nine months ago news full stories Canada purchasing enough vaccines vaccinate four times number people residing country. theory looked great, phase 3 studies released became clear they'd mostly bet wrong vaccines. They'd ordered 76 million doses Canadian company's vaccine appear anywhere close ready produce. also ordered 72 million doses Sanofi/GSK vaccine likely ready 2022, ever. believe initial orders mRNA vaccines fairly small non-existent became clear going best options Canada ended near end line behind countries bet mRNA vaccines early. point less likely hazardous them, unlikely hazardous you. soon law/mandate goes away I'm fine it. think need listen scientists say may needed sake public health 2022, even us vaccinated then. people

I'm expecting high Covid vaccine uptake. Especially messaging around vaccines, life can't return normal taking one President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser, acknowledged interview NBC‚Äôs Meet Press cold weather across US south set back vaccine rollout, projected deficit would made middle next week. ‚ÄúWhen [transmission] goes way overwhelming majority people population vaccinated, would feel comfortable saying, know, ‚ÄòWe need pull back masks‚Äô,‚Äù said. Elsewhere Sunday, former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger told CBS Trump administration ‚Äúmisjudged‚Äù need advocate mask-wearing year ago, early stages pandemic. superbowl superspreader event. rise cases hospitalizations US, FL, Tampa. cannon, explosive progress vaccines causing lot side effects, experiencing common. Actually better reactions. local source vaccine. Same. guess wouldn‚Äôt say confidently believe anything think leaking lab possible maybe even probable. evil reasons don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúcooked lab‚Äù. believe studied lab near wet market got out, maybe infecting tech custodian there. It‚Äôs understanding US‚Äôs death rate low many young people CoVID survived brought death rate down.  ball dropped? too. heard get us 40-49 age range. maybe long go. Same. hoping would prioritise key workers luck me. incivility üõ° Well, think idea supposed wear mask protect people can't get vaccinated rather choose to, effect same. think he's correct this. possible definitely possible may month ago. vaccine working continue work. People listen still need masks 2022-3. drop masks towards fall 2021. Flu shots 40-60% effective pandemic, never see face again, still soon.

I'm sick seeing hearing latest ""predictions."" unpredictable.

Vaccinate people likely die, deaths go couple weeks later. Pretty neat.

Spread going holidays probably starting show lower death counts too. did, started stage 3 trials. say point seem coyly alluding to. *trump country? chance. Haha yeah sounds right. I'm going start fighting normal back spring, enough enough. Pfizer saying need super-freezers anymore, could similar thought. Let's hope lead say patent lawsuit. Thanks, seen story yet. Promising indication, early one study published peer reviewed yet. Lots reason optimism topic, needs proven people vax act like can't spread virus. they? don‚Äôt domestic vaccine ready either. shouldn‚Äôt closest ally neighbor high list? Sorry man. Americans come first America. It‚Äôs is. lot people aren‚Äôt requisite 13 years age required use reddit sound equitable. sending doses poorer countries? Canada privileged enough handle problems. Let take risk want to, decision. We're headed spring well, Florida warm. Lack innovation full display right usual: time money Suck it, Canada God bless TRUMP. 


/s least get vaccinated US? I'm American Spain probably go US vaccine. Relevant, like told public February 2020 substantial danger people Covid? pretty relevant. Pfizer said fuck Canada crying canadian That‚Äôs Pfizer vaccine, article says Germany paid $445 million development. US paid around $2.5 billion development Moderna vaccine, $2.1 billion Sanofi, $1 billion Johnson Johnson. US also paid $1.95 billion doses Pfizer vaccine, wouldn‚Äôt accept federal funding development US. 

You literally cherry picked one companies didn‚Äôt take federal money development vaccine, didn‚Äôt look multiple others received billions US.  Yeah I'm failing super hard right now. üòÇ Man that‚Äôs pretty awful headline NYT certainly tried best make sound controversial possible. Soo go back school? guest friend don‚Äôt try force everyone get side this. Pretty directly related global pandemic, I'd say. understand instead playing ball consortium chose make exclusive deal Chinese company failed. Canada last line major companies since didn‚Äôt pay didn‚Äôt back major vaccine efforts. essentially eggs one basket move. I‚Äôm Canadian life complex I‚Äôm sure 100 word answer rife nonsense people want get back normal, walking around wearing mask normal.

Do remember could walk street, go business, shake hands someone, hug friends family, travel wanted to, worry spreading plague? normal.

Fauci seems clinging ideas keep people separated germ free pandemic ending. crisis almost he's trying make last forever. No. also part EU purchasing agreement. article: De ekstra doser indg√•r som en del af det sampled EU-opk√∏b af vacciner. get money stimulus unemployment boosts, means make 100k/year taxes lose income pandemic. exactly government giving money (ostensibly) middle-upper class economically impacted virus? fixated ‚Äúhow before?‚Äù world amazing want exactly won‚Äôt change literally anything life reason?

Why want breathe produce? freedom? big deal? 

I never understand that‚Äôs probably working medical setting confused people lose shit masks. Like it‚Äôs frickin noose Yup pretty much. would argue we're completely clear risks vaccines, young people risk low (like 0.1% low) comfortable risk covid sure risk vaccine actually yet I'm gonna wait while. requiring either, fair discriminate based health choices right choose health care procedures agree without mandates coercion. half posts I'm defending Pfizer, vaccine made American capitalists... I'm paid Putin I'm lousy job indeed. own. even Canadian, think dumb thing compare Man, difference competent leadership makes. fully support wearing masks, band aid, full way life. that's going make less people cautious rebellions point cannot enforce all. answer. Canada chose vaccine infrastructure. 

95% countries completely dependent actually invested vaccine infrastructure know Ecuador fucked bad

Because almost everybody fucked bad, like every country besides UK Serbia Europe. ah, see. media careful communicating type messaging, morale low make worse comments like fuel anti vaxxers is. 2.6 million doses top eu says included eu Well ever wanted know would like live 1930s Germany, that's good place start üëå google numbers. example 50 million seniors, 18 million health care workers 3 million teachers US. Don‚Äôt go path anger Canada, leads version orange byrrito. Trump said, America first, America first.   agree number people listening dwindling. needs go back science stop trying spokesperson. Read article think comparison need stopped. Vaccine development happen Canada. US Europe export vaccine sufficient supply. 

Also concerned South Africa, Brazil, India, UK etc vaccinated 1st. mutated virus strains wrecking havoc. 

Anyway Canada rich enough buy vaccines supply cease issue. happen imminent future. point Canada could catch fast population significantly less US. people California Canada !!!! even mention design sputnik two different vector viruses superior.  1. Yes
2. Astrazeneka Germany.
3. US UK implemented ban export vaccines. EU exports vaccines 30+ countries, including UK, Israel, UAE, China, Chile, Canada, Japan, NZ, Australia. reason masks effective: touch face less. NYT pretty delusional. People going stop listening pretty soon already. People tired endless parade bad news date ""normalcy"" continually pushed future, first months years. seriously don‚Äôt understand anyone could disagree point. they‚Äôre necessary shouldn‚Äôt mandated. Full stop. Period. End story. really know well vaccines till protect long haul stuff yet.

That true. know mild asymptomatic cases get too. unless research proves otherwise, think safe assume. seem like anyone actually researching this. May topic, anyone else want consider running President next election? Shaming ceo company grand idea! could go wrong? Trump shit. spent entire post-election period trying overturn election. States work. Thank governors. believe essential worker strike back still going on, started back May. 

I never saw real movement. Nurses teachers seems ones strike noticeable one. want say yes? glasses also help far I‚Äôm aware physical barrier eyes/eye skin covid particles Criticize criticism deserved, whining aspect America objectively performing better country makes look petty unreasonable, argument bad faith agree. Every time tells people vaccine help get back normal people decide take it. method Covid Germany ban family contact, FFP2(!) killing retail/touristic everything competition Yanks? wish saw prevention competition win. Bullshit. None research groups going scrap candidates Chrump pre-bought doses one group. stupid comment many levels That's deep according recent history could apparently lead presidency and/or blind acquittals. least guy trying help human race manipulate financial benefit. Masks where? day work? day school?

Or grocery/retail stores, airplanes, subways, airports, DMV? sounds reasonable.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like big deal unless wear mask frickin day.

I‚Äôm still wearing one enclosed public spaces, also someone like isn‚Äôt going go crowded places wear mask, makes sense. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe, avoid crowds. idea people going do. 

I think need stop focusing masks. It‚Äôs made huge deal. Getting economy open, people spending money again, traveling, seeing family, things care about. whether right breathe produce. you‚Äôre fixated that, you‚Äôre looking upset something. Exactly, still think vaccine best solution wouldn‚Äôt surprised people start think like: well even get vaccine restrictions won‚Äôt go, masks stay apparently still social distance fuck vaccine. think itll go away fairly soon, far easy fake avccinated thus renders whole idea inoperable practice Ok, then, yeah, WTF Canada? better this. 

Regards, 
You MI neighbor Actually read three plants one stage production, basically single source supply. Can't find article right though would love see info this. lot people playing Capt Hindsight production capacity could had. 

Canada shut public facilities 80s successive governments restored invested much attracting private manufacturers (not surprisingly - one gets elected promising disaster preparedness, hardly expect politicians predict future crises need prepare urgently).

There also opportunistic companies (one ties opposition party) making bold claims much could produced hindsight *if feds gave extra tens millions little earlier*. claims pretty dubious imo they've woven narrative. Yikes like forgot people still die things..by summer us would better putting ice cream cone putting mask I‚Äôm happy discuss someone who‚Äôs willing learn empathize responding ‚Äúyou need therapy‚Äù makes jerk, correct. rushed timeline (for understandable reasons, course), lots information would normally vaccine approved distributed figured vaccine approved distributed. 

On balance, seems like right call. expect trend take different trajectory several vaccines now, didn‚Äôt before. Controlling global pandemic protecting lives nothing xenophobia

I agree.

but yes. Plague rats

might something it. maybe lol knows predicted universities operate without masks, mandatory vaccines. Hell I'm Europe still probably get vaccine US available. aware vaccine approved US Dec 11th, right? get anxious think we've done good job securing orders. can't expect top priority anyone manufacturing here. 

The first US order seems mid-August, around time UK. That's easier though, since manufacturing in-country, thus, leverage. see definitely one first countries secure lot vaccine. 

The $214M set manufacturing Canada. That's totally reasonable think. also planned even really available year, restoring manufacturing probably be. That‚Äôs unfortunate, front line workers need deserve access. Assuming want take it. numerous articles show vaccine greatly reduces spread.


[Vaccine reduces spread risk even 2nd shot, Israeli study showing Oxford vaccine slows virus spread Moderna vaccine blocks (87-93%) infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) gets rushed hospital ambulance, sit around musing

I see you‚Äôve never ER. you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs show still mandating it? Yikes fine take away right? Rights conditional going accept people hesitant inject new vaccines body everyone gonna (nor need vaccines protect people). vaccine US uses invented Germans lol. That's different. Agreed.

The graph fatalities also 3 peaks times, 2700, 1800 4300 fatalities per day respectively.

The fatalities grown anywhere near much fact decreased first peak 2nd. mentioned past people told deaths would catch up. never did.

In words fatality rate steadily declining declined lot. think explanation exactly say, early ""case"" sick person showing hospital, today likely positive test. cases found among young healthy get sick.

538 great article course nobody read factual Yeah, pessimist pulled ass lol. wrote exactly like Reddit likes read kinds things, get blind upvotes ignorant. Serious question. even live humans copy pasting entities use some
Sort algorithm program scan glean generate harvested content? feel like level hate directed US comes people, consciously otherwise, feeling like they're punching down. need parade show pride, like need church mosque show faithful. Cool story bro. know people fallible doctors make mistakes? Science tends hold steady. RemindMe! 29 days Lol, nice try. Controlling global pandemic protecting lives nothing xenophobia Yikes. seriously hope businesses require people vaccinated enter, way, limited do(: You‚Äôre displaying total lack theory mind. 

It‚Äôs worst thing world year wearing masks, dismissing like ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù really lousy attitude. wear long it‚Äôs something. it‚Äôs show, ‚Äúit‚Äôs lIkE hAt‚Äù isn‚Äôt good reason keep people wearing it. Well, like 5 people Canada. Actually official Dutch vaccination plan, Norwegian numbers proportionally similar Danish estimates - could mistaken. took half million deaths, new president, whole ass year even start fixing shit. 

Cheers everyone who's work matter field in, retail hospital workers everything we've hell year. great news. Please shout te roof tops.
I know data vaccine transmission lot early data shows reduce transmission. 
Right messaging is; get vaccine, keep thing.
This depressing message cause people want get vaccine, specifically young people. 
I know trying curb people lying vaccinated, people lying/cheating/stealing since beginning time. They're already cheating system. 

Either way, thanks work helping others. I'll wear whenever local outbreak (they still coming via antivax crowd), known exposure risk, otherwise sporadic Hm I'm sure, might. *need* it. Vaccines mimic immunity gained natural infection without actually fight full blown virus develop lasting immunity. 100% marketing.

Look Americans accomplished regards rationing, etc WW2. everything propagandized damn successful, though.

Rhetoric ""war virus"" policies set ""battles"" ""fights"" also scientists actively speaking science-based means

 market struggle ""brave warriors"" ""heroes"" medical field would ALSO tugged bleeding heartstrings.

Create programs turn restaurants frontline food suppliers pay accordingly.

Very early scientists recommending PLANNED quarantine/relaxed cycles communities. imagine much less stressful would just, scheduled?

We'd sitting half deaths probably way way fewer problems mental illness, unemployment, economic hardship. president acknowledging claiming since start ""defeated prayer""- would say honest! They're still confirming new vaccines stop transmission (early data shows does) needs scientifically reviewed. That's masks stay place say confidence vaccine helps curb transmission. ain't moving goalposts moreso precautionary. short article explaining doses Pfizer Moderna same. can‚Äôt speak differences side effects two vaccines commenting relationship side effects vaccine effectiveness, although seen nausea listed side effect Moderna. guess argument wanted get back normal maybe taken seriously. guess they'll vaccinated anyone else. would ever need take pandemic seriously? /s sure upvote satire downvote stupidity Problem tell people ""Hey, get vaccinated, wear masks stay indoors anymore!"" going people go get sick vaccine fully kicks in, people still contract virus 100% effective, people go _pretend_ they've vaccinated been. 

It would absolute nightmare tell people early could stop wearing masks practicing social distancing. Makes sense. expected us get million vaccines couple days week due severe weather, actually went better thought would. surprised higher average days result. real issue vaccines intellectual property. It‚Äôs money lives companies. personal opinion? Yes, absolutely. I‚Äôm really excited mostly normal summer. 

And sincerely hope get back completely, 100% normal school soon humanly possible. I‚Äôm ready past this. 

I‚Äôve getting downvoted repeating district said haha. actual post replying said actually planning easing restrictions? Many even hinting it.

Not ""restrictions lifted fast I'd like"" Oh good one *these* Americans vaccine you, suspect actual virus replicating every way inside would far worse. Though I've heard people say vaccine punch kind like COVID minus respiratory distress (plus fact day so). gov.uk website tell everything need know vaccines rollout. Military may allowing go home one reason another Face Nation fascinating morning. They‚Äôre chasing story SARS-CoV-2 originated Wuhan lab. year ‚Äúit‚Äôs lab‚Äù drilled heads, there‚Äôs increasing suspicion actually did... wow.

Yes. Part national plan distribution administration Biden admin got office able start working it. expect greatly improve time. I'm mainly worried contracting fever kind. I'm already stupid forgetful is, Ive heard nasty cases people suffering brain damage. Heck, I'd rather die sustain brain damage already screwed brain lol

I hear vitamin levels play big role case severity . Except 1) gone ages 2) I'm allowed supplements, I'm worried  He‚Äôs conservative. really depends bad mutations get, seems like companies creating vaccines well-prepared point. wonder...why isn‚Äôt answer kids fully remote? mean we‚Äôre told it‚Äôs great alternative school dangerous. anything you‚Äôre coming ahead. course. inequities involved capitalism cause issue, like almost issues people current form America. Personally think really necessary June. things continue direction they're heading, enough transmission justify cancelling events. Hospitalizations already holiday surge new cases July peak.

I think past time start hear real, objective talks metrics full reopening. new normal reopening either, putting things back way without consider infectious diseases planning events. We're tail end need start thinking happens tail end. doesn‚Äôt seem rhyme reason. wouldn‚Äôt look it. may eventually get research saying that‚Äôs probably gonna known long time. round 90%.

90% = dividing risk 10.

80% = dividing risk 5.

So 90% twice good 80%, 91% even little bit better. Sweden 1 million people Israel, Denmark, Finland, Norway little half population, Austria roughly number, Switzerland. developed countries? New Zealand? Every American wants vaccine one well end 2021. saying still need wear masks point? so, criteria getting rid masks, want mandated forever?  thing pulled WW2, too, really. largely ignored Germans blitzing Europe 2 years starting racial extermination (humanitarian crisis) Japan dragged us war. superior manufacturing/logistical output eventually major factor winning war. That's guy warned government need make N95s got ignored. 

He may rethink sale strategy. guess expensive 3M

Governor DeSantis took away ability local government enforce mask mandates last September, essentially making Florida mask-less state. Sure, local government hand ticket fine, cannot collect fine Governor's order ends, knows long be. edited titles.  timelines way off. reality pandemic going US terms actually see next two four months. Probably two three month scale actually part we'll see happens Okay let‚Äôs start taking away vaccine family friends. enough take town area cases go hospitals still overwhelmed. grandma stay inside longer one Canada leave house. It‚Äôs really not. help loading scanning. Lines tend long, great job. Maybe... guess living world finite resources. Conservative politicians don‚Äôt look you. look interests donors. Full stop.  homeschooling kid, ruining life according reddit. he's school, single handedly murdering vaccinated teachers. can't fucking win.


I simply offering different perspective. kids excel e-learning. Shit, prefer online classes in-person ones. However kids really struggle. Mine one them.

My kid's district handling well. offered e-learning numbers high transitioned in-person state said person allowed staff able receive vaccinations. 

I'm sure else done? There's also theory super small % population responsible majority spread. mobile / likely infected / likely pass someone else, /etc. population it, virus may running vectors. Well weren‚Äôt normal vaccine life cycle since world pumped shit ton resources it. low death rate one cared initially. Half work got COVID sniffles. still, even totally rational it, really understand everyone know that's gotten COVID mild yet killed many. Yeah, going happen. work school young kids couple difficult ones go ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre children we‚Äôre gonna get sick, wear mask?‚Äù Except many people - even elderly - don‚Äôt ability get vaccinated yet. It‚Äôs widely available enough. two sets relatives (in laws aunt/uncle) 70 unable get vaccinated due supply (these two separate states, it‚Äôs one locale). 

Also, it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs elderly suffering potentially life altering complications virus. Younger people LONG lasting issues. 

So no, end March likely far soon dropping mask mandates. good news though time we‚Äôre hitting critical mass, we‚Äôre also likely able open entire country outdoor dining, etc. making keeping economy close fully running much easier. idea anyone predict what's going happening year kinda silly. We've able predict like 6 weeks best. use masks rapid testing workplaces schools? US getting vaccinated high rate currently would optimistic residents immune November. depends rules concerning out-of-towners proof vaccination. Probably. see certain states areas while. response: don‚Äôt live reason. get free bald eagle every dose? US healthcare system might suck lot ways, also created environment large pharmaceutical companies could prosper. shit big pharma suddenly need big pharma. Personally *really* don‚Äôt want long covid staying careful get vaccinated somtime early summer. long covid low risk I‚Äôm wfh kids privilege able heavily influence risk level (socialise less, outside, go shops off-peak, etc). key word first sentence ""if"". going logic, bury titanium box avoid pesky meteorites hitting head, they're risk too!

Those three things well established, spread misinformation. Vaccines work excellently still, well established thanks Israel, shortly UK well. Again, can't holed something small chance occuring. evolves less issue? Following logic, means unlock everything right now, that's potential line could take.

It's false optimism. wanting anyone happy. sorry hear that. hope able get sorted soon. luck, US vaccine manufacturing exceed domestic demand soon expect Canada tops list exports. Canada 10% population USA. surprising. hope improves guys. Despite vaccination rate, far fairly distributed. Still lots compromised elderly even received first shot yet USA. ... factory produce in. Well that's cruel lol. rub in... really good EU btw, finally got Pfizer appointment, 2 months earlier thought would;) don‚Äôt think Fauci ever says ‚Äúwe mask mandate until...‚Äù knows that‚Äôs call. political decision. mask mandates based emergency orders. little risk overwhelming hospitals emergency doesn‚Äôt exist.  It‚Äôs like think health decisions made vacuum. No, political legal ramifications. P everyone take time work quarantine 14 days. huge problem wanting see loved ones. school system ""strapped cash""; pay part-time administrators quarter mil year nothing push paper around Think political pressure. millions people US gotten vaccine yet either want go back normal life. roles reversed would same.

There‚Äôs little chance large restrictions exist deaths/hospitalizations/cases incredibly low 
You worrying this. 

As young person risk covid, even catch it, low.

In order catch covid interaction person would need actually infected. Even then, guarantee. civil. Something else chomp on: US's response everything since 1800s innovate way problems. 

Heart disease? Lose weight? Nope, drugs.

Pollution? Strict regulations? Nope, carbon capture.

Slightly old building? Repair upfit? Nope, tear build bigger.

We kind refuse make personal sacrifices better things around us. lean toward brute-force innovations make things better. Good bad, you, surprise many Americans wanted keep like status quo, expenditure many lives, wait break-neck speed vaccination dig us out.

Capitalism, wealth, comfort lead us place vast majority Americans want make personal sacrifices greater good. forego 2nd package toilet paper, someone else get it! probably *actually* need it. better get get mine.

We selfish nation, continue reap rewards seeds planted us, fear lack empathy wreck country time comes can't innovate way sticky spot. Like worldwide climate catastrophy vaccine-resistant plague.

Or maybe I'm pessimist. Indeed. Lol Yes, were. said US focus US citizens people dying, next breath said ‚Äúand btw, Canada didn‚Äôt help us‚Äù. It‚Äôs height hypocrisy say - exactly government supposed do? Go stop President selfish idiot? 

Also, I‚Äôm sure decided write essay US needs vaccines, literally started comment saying don‚Äôt expect US help us. get it, moaning Canada helped US makes sense. hope manage better checkouts! Going Costco ordeal. advice I‚Äôd give pay attention Covid situation progresses next months. start Q3 July, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôll decent outlook Fall/Winter look like year. Requiring masks != lockdowns. Mask requirements cost almost nothing stay covid actually eliminated US. workplaces still open back up. give younger people! I'd take AZ right instead wait summer get one mRNA vaccines I've purposely keeping close track last heard leave Canada come back put mandatory Hotel quarantine bill 2k local pharmacy get thermometer vitamin gummies,

I'm allowed either that's issue demonstrate fundamental misunderstanding viruses operate? mean viruses discriminate citizenships. 

I can't help wonder effective first strategy actually is. kid, worried about? Yeah, America wrong matter people.

I'm criticizing America, actual many fuck ups. Criticizing us vaccine roll seems like jealousy (something never thought I'd see towards America last disastrous years). Source? News today hard deem truthful fake. Reddit generally deem 75% true. good news good news. Canadian living Japan here. non-medical, non-over 65 person I'm looking vaccination September earliest. Canada fine Yep, that‚Äôs without rate continuing increase. Sources please. /s young, likely die severe case. Go local pharmacy get thermometer donde vitamin gummies, try take breather calm down. Though person behaved irresponsibly, likely covid. check youself symptoms tru keep calm. Best wishes, well. like Fauci he's terrible prognasticator. Got pricked yesterday. Got lucky show took parents get theirs. Anyone wanna kiss? Brazil problem one. Japan possibly. They've shown UK one neutralized vaccine. vulnerable population vaccinated infected, covid dangerous flu. total population vaccinated infected, covid dangerous common cold. 

So, dealt way dealt flu colds decades. something people catch time time, one pays much attention to. Maybe booster shots, like flu.

There historical precedent this, way: believed ""Russian flu"" epidemic 1890 actually caused coronavirus. virus still endemic, one several viruses cause common Even that's true, risk long-covid infinitely higher refusing nothing extra 6 months risk moderate-severe illness, taking vaccine completely removes mild cases. totally illogical moronic, whatever way spin it. lot countries world much bigger issues worry Covid they‚Äôre focusing it. It‚Äôs turning much worse countries normal. incorrect. Pfizer manufactures doses Michigan.

For example... % heart disease, emphysema, diabetes, cancer, MS, etc etc vs general population, much conditions typically reduce lifespans ages died underlying conditions passed? Yup, going backfire vaccines open general public unless change messaging.

Even Biden's admin, messaging still absolutely brutal time. need come say something like, ""We'll able ditch masks X number people fully vaccinated. number could change based new data, current goal.""

Mmmmk. convenient motivation. funny. also said people gross. **shrug* Canada made huge deal China early pandemic vaccine. China reneged retribution holding Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou leaving Canada empty handed. scramble make deals Pfizer Moderna back line. like realism percentage country vaccinated? map?

What map list states US showing percentage population that's vaccinated far? opening schools primarily affects people color, therefore racist reopen. That's entirely true.

We still let essential people see closed ones summer homes long followed specific guidelines. failure though one followed hahaha getting fined left right. exactly Canada's fault. transitioned CRB. requirements, fundamentally Patience easy word use people dying every day. fucking bullshit we're shafted companies. Major lawsuits filed immediately. That's anticipating huge increase amount supply coming weeks. takes time ramp administration, goal supply bottleneck vaccinating everyone. start ramping now, there's way we'd ready give shots weeks.

I can't say like Trudeau much, he's still miles better conservatives screwing future sake short time profit politics US. I've received lots angry comments already. many realize need vaccinate world wipe spread mutations continue develop. sooner everyone gets vaccinated, better. Nationalism folly comes global pandemics. point lots people USA wearing masks? it? Actually, study lab one, done large size vaccinated Israeli population. Granted, know exact details publish it, here's link detailed article Spiegel science (in German). really hope numbers accurate. America supposedly vaccinating close 2 million per day say? Yet still cant get list? get it, lot sick people seniors 2 million per day? Thats lot sick people lol not. Freedom press mean freedom consequences Maybe - went ONE wearing night. anymore, they're not. CERB ran ages ago. broken study reading conclusions sane one, doesn‚Äôt make right. It‚Äôs still broken study.

Then, hour point: data points suggesting efficacy increases time, first dose. might. don‚Äôt data support it.

As SAGE did, you‚Äôre guessing without supporting evidence.

EDIT: study mention mixes mRNA vaccines. It‚Äôs pointless this. Pfizer vaccine. MP make-up? That‚Äôs power is. Yes individual towns might. Kindergarten required USA (at least state - I‚Äôm sure 50). It‚Äôs first year formal education much academic 20-30 years ago.

That said, delaying kindergarten entirely reasonable decision many families. Early elementary grades can‚Äôt taught effectively online, families might reasonably decide child starting school 6 years old, rather 5, would better trying muddle pandemic school year child‚Äôs first formal schooling. Yea sure household name 13 months ago. Get outta that. here. bought lots nice equipment home gym end work sets dealing kids. don‚Äôt care say. 

Calm down, next winter 10-plus months away lot things plan don‚Äôt want masks 10 months. 

Totally plausible won‚Äôt need them, anyway. It‚Äôs us, adults. :) still benefit vaccine recover, likely won't.need two doses. California ask type papers Law. Theres lot immigrants there, best interest fully vaccinate everyone. America bad  No, think way think countries took serious deserve vaccine first.

Not US suffer more.

I hope clears thought comes from. 50% Americans WANT vaccine? half population willing take it? think that's Fauci alluding to. there's large reluctance inoculate can't reach herd immunity could end another Winter Surge Dec/Jan. admit, laughed. Seriously, it‚Äôs surreal see getting downvoted calling antagonization people don‚Äôt exist. people want pandemic continue even lesser actually making money long run; people want make boogeyman blame past year. wear mask messaging led increased transmission see could dangerous. 

Anyone swayed ""I still wear mask,"" reason vaccinate told everyone vaccinated every restriction goes away. that's still excuse told, underlying reason willing share. Excuses. homeschooled environment probably better public schools regard developed learning. failing 2nd grade math spending time parents night flashcards allowed run circles around peers.

The issue parents don‚Äôt time teach kids children lag behind social skills result learning isolated environment. experience MD/VA/DC area. colleagues able find appointments. drove 60 mins away waited line, outside 2 hours. compared getting appointment buying PS5 Christmas. starting wonder positive news stories coming US. CNN talk CNN headlined this, too. 

Not saying Fauci even sensationalize science, bet copy paste thing media lot of. probably want end anytime soon use marketing ploy, course going sensationalize science even sides government already. me. curious. pissed Feds? really vaccine companies delivering orders made? I'm clear government force pony up, pressuring saying ""Hey, WTF?"" Lawsuits?

You‚Äôre forgetting need can‚Äôt get vaccinated. may can't get it, nothing they're immunocompromised. best course action significant number people want it, allow crowded places, like bars, restaurants, malls, airports, theaters, etc. Move out, you‚Äôre adult insane. brother threatening disconnect phone service move crazy borderline abusive.

Also, messaging Fauci like article going increase number people decline vaccine. can't get back normal vaccination, lot people wonder point vaccine. Oregon disappointing, really seems vaccine rollout hamstrung fact cannot produce existing options domestically. doubt technological issue (as opposed cost effective), since vaccine production entirely entrusted private companies, we're mercy export restrictions profit motive.

""What's great is: rate..."" surprised? says lot character. ""**We're going significant degree normality beyond terrible burden us last year**.""

lmao precautions

I agree absolutely, I‚Äôll let kids swim there‚Äôs lifeguard responsible adult present. 

But that‚Äôs lot kids die drowning. It‚Äôs number one cause accidental death among children. 

But shouldn‚Äôt controversial say less likely occurrence is, fewer precautions bother taking (and certainly fewer precautions actually mandate society take). Thanks man. posted bunch sources well getting tired topic. English language news like report all. rather talk EU blocking exports every western country gets supplied directly Brussels ... coming Pfizer Moderna might one shot deal, going open lot oppurtunities people get vaccine higher efficacy rate. if. 

Many take Biden's ""100 Days Masking"" face value stop wearing masks April. reading suddenly became aware actively touching face. definitely makes sense high-risk folk vaccinated first. alright Canada forgoing vaccination younger people /nonessential workers order ensure senior citizens essential workers every country vaccinated first? quite tiresome. mention mental health effects some. strongly disdain wearing mask. asthma really miserable. itching day we're told longer need masks.  studies approve vaccine started trials way national vaccine rollout started? Lmao, can't see room wriggle around statement can't help you. 

Fauci may good scientist, outright manipulation help. guess point I‚Äôm making extra dose coworker‚Äôs appt canceled. dose get somebody‚Äôs arm soon. mean good though ? mean yes, agreed contracts, anything blocking exports. nothing UK blocking exports; mean legislation etc. EU could put clause contract saying get priority vaccines, didnt.  Wearing mask ‚Äúsetting fire.‚Äù That‚Äôs price letting domestic vaccine production go, outsourcing it. Hopefully become wiser.  Exactly.

I'd like informed answers, best guesses based preliminary results.

The issue? medical guidance inconsistent based ""available data.""

For example, Covid infect food xan infected food get someone sick? One year later studies. China reports contaminated meat, answers topic? Either one wants studies (for obvious reasons), entire process disorganized (i.e. 1 yr China discovers infected pet dog, West ""discovers"" ur pet get infected).

Downvote comment u like; Im fan guesses. Im fan solid science. Please dont provide best guesses, Dr. Fauci... üò∑ Every piece evidence currently points fact vaccines - minimum - GREATLY reduce transmission virus. US, we're getting fooled comparing case totals case totals last spring summer lot less testing. 


So example, 7-day running average cases California 6700, comparable July 2 last year. California running twice many tests per day last July, we're missing lot fewer cases back then. 


If follow 's true infection estimates, California week away reaching lowest levels infection since last March pandemic began. Source what? amount vaccinations could adequate supply? lack supply? mainly refers jobs automated, like warehouse jobs. jobs ""luxury"" jobs, i.e. things could would rather pay someone eventually return, continue clandestine manner whole affair, yet automated. Industries like restaurants theme parks continued exist replaced spite past recessions, exactly something disappear forever. 

Encouraging people change careers covered tuition costs career advice they're left dust something common moving forward working landscape continues change technology advances, article stated legislation may included farther line, I'm hopeful changes come be. Yeah, USA going vaccinated long lot major players... think death toll along way. Roughly 1000 deaths per 1m population Canada.

Would rather vaccinated 4 months later hell lot people dying? False, flu season peaks typically peaks January per CDC. Canadians ‚ÄúI eUrOpEaN‚Äù people stop making fun us fucking everything lmao makes think anyone trying open up?

We‚Äôre talking MASKS. tiny piece cloth face. Holy privilege Batman. Agreed, I‚Äôve back Canada since Covid thankfully able work remotely company USA I‚Äôm starting consider chance flight go back get vaccinated...used think healthcare system second none, leadership power feels like one incompetent nations block. source? Nah, know want think it‚Äôs trump, buts it‚Äôs really governors lack aggressiveness came enforcing mask mandates lockdown orders. power it, trump came federal Institutions like military government agency‚Äôs mask mandates begin world shut like 3 weeks. haven‚Äôt noticed, things back normal people masks faces 

Most people don‚Äôt want take small risk dying eat restaurant key word ""possible"" whenever see headline always ignore hell article.

They‚Äôll move goalposts again. Per capita, UK, Portugal, Czechia, Italy fared worse. I'm north Cali get, right we're getting 300 vaccine doses week. county 7k people 65. Id less surprised lotto manage get vaccinated next three months. IDs needed live work nursing home, getting one. read every commercial? ( besides vaccines ) Actually following isolation procedures.  New Zealand almost completely eradicated covid, largely restriction-free situation whole time, suffering much terms death rate. It‚Äôs fucking hard lose entire year half college this. supposed best years life. NEVER get time back. comes once. It‚Äôs fucking devastating.

I‚Äôll go work life away good little capitalist without ever getting full experience. Canada we‚Äôve facilities produce vaccines like American many countries doing. I‚Äôm tired politician giving excuses same. 
I also never forgive Brian Mulroney selling away. I'm getting downvoted sub everything end world dt left office, everyone amazing Biden came saved day. Dt's performance disastrous sure, making big deal 100m shots joke. would happened dt, amazing goal. msm officially made covid Bidens now, pitching great every aspect. potential massive wave next 2 months, biden frankly acting flat-footed hits, dts. People get that.   Lol good relations. Let‚Äôs take online bickering mean anything true international relations year bald faced lies false optimism, overly cautious really bad? first time modern history anything like happened frankly I'd rather hear bad news end pleasantly surprised fed optimistic nonsense end disappointed frustrated. Like Fauci saying may vaccine spring 2021 getting earlier awesome, compared promised vaccine October 2020 wait longer. clear. argument?

US: going screw me!

CAN: uhh what? think so? thought cool

*US screws canada""

US: See! knew going screw me!

There understandable justifications US' actions definitely one Yes should. yet there's enough vaccines give ""essential workers""...... NYer here. confirm. know people personally, friends family/friends died covid. (an American expat) talking casual cruelty Canadian coworkers. situation reverse; currently can't buy US. beef EU China. best way lower transmission would vaccinate young people first. Vacines treatment. Though. Better farming methods. Better tracing is. seems like forgot that. Endless loop what? Vaccinations? Yeah, likely get yearly COVID vaccine, like flu shot. don‚Äôt shutdown annual flu. live it, that‚Äôs COVID-19. It‚Äôs clear don‚Äôt know young people. hit us hard need vaccinate **everyone** get back normal. seniors people severe health problems vaccinated, basically over. That's 90%+ deaths come probably like 35% population. second. saying media sensationalizing headlines clicks consumer product thrives ad revenue?
Cause spot on. Let ask you: endgame? Canada keeps dropping ball

I really know expect Canada do, they're small country can't develop/distribute vaccine fast bigger countries heard enraged, EU basically saying ‚Äúno ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù EU same. understand EU annoying pricks (‚Äúfairness‚Äù despite France Germany etc buying extra doses) don‚Äôt understand Irish government rejecting it? you? hospital I'm thinking of, ceo already fired. made news. Looking would difficult, shaming people nothing. care even controlling per capita, canada far worse. Aside usually taking several years make vaccine, mainly mRNA thing new way making vaccine, far know done vaccines past. new method development, amount data like vaccines we've decades used mRNA technology. try get company's patent invalidated, that's expensive difficult. think they're likely license comment assumptions therein equally stupid. I‚Äôm going try convince complete imbecile internet proud his/her stupidity. using ""backbone"" changing spike protein mean need vitro tests efficacy small safety trial, regulatory approval almost straight away agreeing regulators beforehand process. similar annual flu vaccine, mainly vitro.

They ""designed"" vaccine already making first doses (and continueproduction preparation), check spring early summer regulated autumn doses ready.

They pretty confident work based well last one works. sounds reasonable, need sources back assertion. mad exactly? successful vaccination effort? think media isn‚Äôt treating Biden poorly enough? 

If it‚Äôs second, gives fuck? set achievable goal crush it. hurts one. Flu virus survives food hours sure different. Also put fingers eyes nose mouth virus infect food.  Covid H1N1 essentially same

Yes, sense 9/11 London bombings essentially same.

Given can't connect dots understand underlines touch are.

Seriously though, care 30k died H1N1? lives matter? start caring individual number gets 300k, 3 million. I'm curious, magic number sudden declared king empathy? comment assumptions therein equally stupid. I‚Äôm going try convince complete imbecile internet proud his/her stupidity. saying can't blame vaccine shortcomings Troubadour like moronic uncles cousins constantly do? states smoking condition would place 1A/1B, like PA instance. Chinas saying since last year! comment assumptions therein equally stupid. I‚Äôm going try convince complete imbecile internet proud his/her stupidity. Okay man, want itroverted redditor hide face shame rest life go ahead. 

Don‚Äôt force people. mask coming forever months unless i‚Äôm doctors office requires Yep technically gone completely next winter simmer low levels largely inconsequential summer. Probably evolve cold like illness long term cells  ü•≥ 'funny' Canada globally criticized buying much vaccine population (5x over), beg India some. ‚ÄúGottlieb says something positive once‚Äù Fair‚ÄîI'm 20's honestly brain fog thing concerned, especially people age gotten even though severe symptoms.. Upvoted asked question, revived hitler anything I‚Äôve generally seen, recently, thread least, users saying they‚Äôre willing wait vaccine widely available dropping restrictions. 

But importantly, username made want red velvet cupcake. agree! issue supply constraints (there lot days, though getting better). perfect world we‚Äôd best vaccine. turn AZ offered risk unvaccinated several months take pretty good option? 

Hopefully time supply issues longer issue aren‚Äôt point today. Maybe Pfizer going single shot needing subzero temps help, going untested waters terms whether impacts vaccine‚Äôs efficacy. things bad reddit says president work. things good reddit says president effect governors. realize, already jumped humans. thing COVID. mutate. already outbreaks Ebola. We're ""endless loop"" influenza variants every single year; evolution happens, different target spikes present, target new serotypes (or old ones reemerge). happened COVID-19 small part result sweeping population almost wholesale immunologically na√Øve; case going forward, people least partial immunity emergent variants natural infection vaccination. Getting vaccines target new seasonal variants likely become norm *that's good thing*. they‚Äôre concerned people flaunting restrictions lying vaccinated, don‚Äôt say then? 
This comes messaging trust. Public health experts abysmal moment pandemic started Good Israelis!!! I‚Äôm happy great place pandemic wise! I'm hopeful well data soon. preliminary data coming around transmissibility vaccination, data huge hopes herd immunity.

I heard interesting point Week Virology podcast (TWiV) day. really first pandemic we've broadscale PCR genetic testing for. smallpox, idea herd immunity really well stopped people showing hospital, preventing asymptomatic cases. Thus bit scary. COVID issue years. least flu minimal year. Masks normal. I'd like common going forward personally intend Yeah fights parking lot, plus diplomats like park fire lane piss everyone off. time people get checkout, it‚Äôs 15 people deep blocking first aisles, tempers totally shot! new clinical trial? Yes, suspect reason I'll never get lack memorization young age, spoken home, school. find impressive people remember all!

English really interesting hodgepodge languages, less efficient lot ways unique wonder Moderna‚Äôs storage temps? Considering they‚Äôre similar it‚Äôs possibility right? 10% mortality rate, wouldn‚Äôt need lockdown keep people home. Italy shut down. never have. Unless entire world gets vaxd does, going endless loop. guys could used Canadian labs make Canadian vaccine. Idk America expected cover everyone else absorbing 100% R&amp;D good news US without vaccine they'd absolutely fucked. Hopefully helps quickly return normalcy rescues good lesson future. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. It‚Äôs true. goal easily achievable start.

I also remember bring 100million people. happened that? feel gaslighted. msm acting like thats never goal, talking 100m shots seemed unavoidable. Bs Which, honestly quite technological achievement. practicable, I'd love see FDA fast-tracking new mRNA vaccines functionally formulation current Pfizer Moderna vaccines, targeting variant spikes. safety testing remains important part process, giving benefit doubt efficacy portion things stands save quite lives expediting vaccination timelines emergent variants.  size landmass that's important,

It's use it. want abuse children forcing wear masks restrict them, go ahead. prepared disown get older. Sorry sound dramatic im heavily impacted situation, mother really sick cant go back country uk made bs. work wont let go wanted come back would pay tests quarantine. madness. nothing like country. Im thinking leave UK good continues. worst country pandemic nobody cares mental health Ontario government help money need quarentine. need pay back it, least home. Me, too. That's right. basically honor system sites California, major pharmacies like CVS. states ID requirements, California doesn't.

For occupation-based eligibility, ask paystub, something like that. getting hospital getting covid, make heart attack another person deadly hospital crisis mode departments change covid make people get worser treatment should. 

So becoming burden country‚Äôs hospitals therefore shouldn‚Äôt join society sick=people get worser treatment might die

Have thought that? unselfish you?

Go eat McNuggets - know made of? putting INSIDE body, oh care makes feel strong weaker human beings need help. Got ! StoNks Speaking American may totally off, reopen border fully vaccinated people (from either nation) could boon economies well Im sure could improve enough vaccines go around. You‚Äôre denier say Covid H1N1 essentially same, difference social media. nuance there. 

Being touch one thought fellow human two different things.

My privilege losing half income, knowing certain haven‚Äôt spread disease caused someone else‚Äôs death. 

If caring others touch put it, wonder many Americans died. European checking in, pissed too. alone! That's human rights violation would prove ""the government wants control us"" crowd 100% right. That's total defense patent infringement.

Isn‚Äôt pretty good defense? One requirements getting patent issued invention must ‚Äúobvious someone art‚Äù. another company could whip thing moment‚Äôs notice, could argue patent never issued. You‚Äôre never vaccinating everybody US. Heck according Fauci we‚Äôre vaccinating kids mid next year. answer pandemic ""follow science."" solution look science, look society, see realistically beat thing. Nate's job analyze society, he's always perfect, he's better virologists whose sole job analyze science. Variants keep popping up, keep vaccinating people effectively provides least immunity. keep tweaking vaccines necessary hopefully manage stay ahead it, cases keep dropping although maybe less rapidly we've seen, things reopen gradually, life comes back, etc. think it'll tad slower people hope. long variant alters spike protein fine understanding, however get one renders vaccines useless that's cause concern regardless badly people want think otherwise. mom would never let tendies burn! policy referring partly human nature even though know better.

What k ow better? I‚Äôm trying figure you‚Äôre referring you‚Äôre cryptic appreciate sentiment wasn‚Äôt person asking. actually something Asian teens long time. remember bunch girls saying really like pretend feel sick wear mask break out. Fuckin suck Canada studies coming out, Pfizer transported normal fridges wanted launch optimum ssoluition prevent issues. There's also tallks single shot pfizer üôÑüôÑüôÑ someone knows numbers vaccine's efficiency? 500K argentina can't find anything. Best luck you. 

As Scot still can‚Äôt believe well Tory English government rolling vaccine coming agreement ever ‚ÄúYes‚Äù Scotland. sucks see great government fail. thought Canada would New Zealand came covid progressiveness, hope - soon!  thing find nuts FL though many people coming going like way many places. ton spend week fly back home. contract Covid late trip won‚Äôt pop get back going.  

I bring that‚Äôs exactly happened one prominent deaths small town next summer. whole family went Florida came back home started feeling sick day later matriarch pillar community dead Covid 3 weeks later. thing old boss came back FL Covid positive hospitalized within week (incubation time matched trip). friend‚Äôs parents thing without hospitalization. knows means numerically it‚Äôs definitely happening. I'm trying rag get also families could spread could spread others even though take tons precautions could theoretically spread patients people well. 100% plan you. flat refuse az (if ever offered here) J&amp;J (which likely offered soon). I'm working home playing safe unlikely month wait make much difference risk.... hope we'll option time comes. Otherwise might waiting long time. Same... limits. American know  really hope similar ‚Äúvaccines won‚Äôt slow transmission‚Äù claim experts repeatedly trot out, bad faith statement. It‚Äôs vaccines *aren‚Äôt likely* slow spread Covid-19 - it‚Äôs don‚Äôt data definitively say don‚Äôt ... probably will. 

I really hope Fauci‚Äôs version that. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say sure won‚Äôt wearing masks 2022. Sure, guess it‚Äôs *possible* covid 19 variant could arise sends everyone catches covid hospital even getting vaccinated .... c‚Äômon ... won‚Äôt be‚Äù. generally regard variant too, though call Kent variant iirc need everything spoonfed you? research. Right, again, you‚Äôre going use NY original response data set, rest country irrelevant... everybody claiming ‚Äúthere‚Äôs sense wiping groceries it‚Äôs really hard get infected except breathing in‚Äú

I dont think single confirmed case someone gettin covid via groceries, yeah.

It sure doesnt hurt, many much, much effective precautions people shoukd take first. Wtf every day says something different I've never seen ad coronavirus vaccine I'm assuming that's referring hearing disclaimers? thing Pfizer Moderna testing people showed symptoms. AZ tested participants every week.

We know effective Pfizer actually is, trials comparable. Well similar problem Janssen, actually quoted efficacy ""moderate severe"" covid, others measured mild covid too. hard compare vaccines measure things differently. Happens Colorado well, luckily make large amount issued vaccines stories rich families places like Brazil fly stay resort town number weeks get fully vaccinated leaving. tried using mask better fit? found ffp3 mask fog glasses, especially coupled fabric mask block vent. Citing basic feature median describing data compared (often simply described ""average"") small proportion extremely large small values, therefore provides better representation ""typical"" value. think Americans owe one. I‚Äôm hoping start really cranking vaccinations send north. Let‚Äôs get border open return good relations think actively detrimental point. young, healthy, worried vaccine, would get still can't anything?

Whereas ticket concerts, bars, making strangers, that's whole different story.

Plus people believe first message get. change message, people wonder lied too, know doing.

The reluctance say covid airborne insane. Sure, full studies confirming yet, every coronavirus airborne! focus hand washing masking measured city's worth dead bodies. think point substantial portion COVID cases Florida travelers tested positive elsewhere vacation ended valid point addressed enough, 100% case Super Bowl celebrations given Tampa local team Tampa really national-fanbase people would travel Tampa game watch either stadium city. America First unacceptable understandable national policy. 

What mean? Even good world leaders! Merkle (I mean really specifically know mean) botched badly I'm entirely convinced I'll able get vaccinated next 12 months, never mind end summer 2021. 

""We said 'by end summer' say one."" Yep. entire post entirely BS. US sucked mitigation nation's budgets work (state governments spend money actively have) former president absolutely zero interest getting national congress anything temporarily change that. point things help like former president making masks partisan issue, that's really sideshow. end day real lockdowns impossibility, instead got bold faced lies like ""6 feet magic"", ""eating indoors safe"", official CDC policy flies face scientific reality covid airborne transmission virus. pissed. year plan vaccinating rate give everyone single dose 3 years.

They set goal produce vaccine within country. idiots don‚Äôt care people‚Äôs lives, least care money. Every day let virus persist economy loses. enough motivation find way make happen. every excuse there‚Äôs countermeasure consider millions billions losing prolonging problem. E.g. really smart person proves it‚Äôs possible produce vaccine here, well come plan force continuous mass testing. someone ELI5, soI understand vaccine stop getting it, means get get harmed, like bodies already ready fight it.

So infections dropped 95%? idiotic people sub spending last days dunking Canada America seen far worse failure public health. great vaccine race erase massive failures we've let happen past year. Well, bother? opening schools primarily affects people color, therefore racist reopen.

Its class-based issue race-based one friend. Poverty something affects people matter skin color. plenty. Service industry. Warehousing. Retail.

""It sounded ambitious first blush: 100 million vaccination shots 100 days.

Now, one month presidency, Joe Biden glide path attain goal pitching well beyond it"" Thank explaining! understand. Though procedures changing due Biden, early pandemic response US largely state-by-state basis. terrifying way, state functioning much like independent city-state. Varying laws, infection rates, laws, levels available equipment‚Äîat one point, believe states bidding get PPE. nuts hard follow.

Anyway, that‚Äôs background state/country comparison. Seems apt useful me! That‚Äôs hear side effects read television commercials. haven‚Äôt seen tv commercial vaccines buddy get information from? Got source? base opinions raw data, less base bias opinion. think Nate's takes gospel, least he's trying tell numbers story.  stupidiest comment read today read comments too. California gets vaccinating MAJORITY population New York Florida does, would problem people come get it. fact would welcome it. 

My problem SPECIFICALLY allowing rich foreigners come country get citizens do. little guy Wait... good Covid news USA?! Wtf. That‚Äôs nice, I‚Äôd rather vaccine 95% chance keeping getting sick all. think it‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs making news. school district completely shut since Marchbegan bringing young students back January, tomorrow bring 5th graders. Middle schoolers next. High school sports also resumed. 

Anecdotally, friend group teen severe depression household- 3 hospitalized since March. It‚Äôs bad. Cus wearing mask big inconvenience? dipshit critique guy won‚Äôt shut mouth contradictions. Also want people get vaccine, keep telling can‚Äôt go back normal till 2022 whenever scientific magic 8 ball tells wanna stay ur basement say it. judge (ok maybe little). That's denial.

You might young adult 2001 I'll spell you. 

I adult towers fell. 9/11 real. Osama bin Laden real. Planes hit towers Pentagon. Terrorism real threat.

After 9/11 War Terror went overdrive. spent trillions dollars waging war need, costing hundreds thousands lives making world absolutely safer before.

Covid exactly scenario, time magnified even social media complicit magnifying threat. politicians media do, work opportunistically public enemy #1. 

Had social media zoom-like tech, covid would looked heck lot like 2008's H1N1. would shrugged collective shoulders moved on. talking herd immunity. actual vaccine protects individual. people get vaccine, need force don't. disagree premise, Canadians undeserved sense superiority. However, talking context COVID specifically, worth remembering Canada could go almost 2 years current daily mortality rate they'd still fewer COVID deaths per capita US does. even Canada ends vaccinated 2-3 months behind US (probably fair estimate based projections), human cost COVID still vastly higher US. got already! Fuck that. I‚Äôm getting second shot time.  know it‚Äôs tough man. done that. don‚Äôt push back they‚Äôll continue walking you. plan applying jobs? Sometimes end day there's bit vaccine left that's usable next day. someone shows might get it. systems horrifically overfunded. Maybe correctly allocate money instead paying state senator's crooked cousin quarter mil year part-time ""administrator"" push paper around

My old school district: LAUSD billions thrown it, keeps somehow finding way sink lows. problem blatant corruption, mismanagement, incompetence ruins public school system. fair countries get vaccinate low risk people high risk people vaccinated. state fucked nobody got vaccinated everyone every state got vaccinated would think unfair go another state get vaccine?  wipe groceries. glasses must protect too.

You getting covid far prove wiping groceries rise risk getting it. Huh? pace everything drastically slowed  mean, we're 10x size Canada. Si think great, I'm also surprised? Also, seems like weird metric. cares? Bigger problems world right arbitrary name strain gets. tell politicians üòÇ everything closed even legally allowed meet one person! Despite city small number infections day. I‚Äôve never happier read headline.
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre different era now. Nah someone gotta tell kid truth. slug warehouse save move out. 700 Million, 2 doses everyone US. clearly demonstrates substantial progress. Plus, percentage represents progress towards herd immunity.

Huge morale. Yep, many people really fair force injections small minority? acquire natural immunity too. know seem proportional. assumed though, look across age gender demographics. young healthy people dying calculation would different. promise deliver one absolute worse communication strategies engage in. First piss people bad projections, piss people don‚Äôt follow time lines. people suspect promising, don‚Äôt even get benefit leeway. Also idea nobody gets pissed exceed projections wrong. happens people expect exceed projections ever give realistic timeline/expectations future hit those, you‚Äôve already failed people expect exceed them. 

If really running Biden administration ass backwards communication strategy voted trump. least knew kind idiot was. told children less likely spread virus, yet schools still closed almost year later.

There lot corrupt teacher's unions blocking attempts re-open schools. surprising since many stopped caring needs students long ago. Neither coronavirus... keep track percentages vaccinated? anything vaccination process except raw numbers.

Seems that's system, someone could come get vaccinated every day, people places could come get vaccinated, California literally never know protected citizens are. yea honestly point governments consider seriously. government (italy) refraining giving AZ pfizer supply pretty low. idea sound, enough doses i'd go without doubt, feel time biggest concern right now, meaning doubts giving vaccine (did write correctly?) Masks work too! :) Maybe one's entertainment focus equal civil rights? risks different necessarily, taking risk different purposes certainly matter.  cases still would occur especially new variants idiot politicians would look justify masks despite hospitalizations dropping cliff. Late spring/early summer gang whaddup actually negative. message pragmatic realism. sounded negative clear strategy mitigating risk nationally. bet...they use final stick somewhere around July? know people lie vaccinated bunch afraid local police fed list vaccinated spit without mask jail you. According article it‚Äôs pure speculation part surgeon featuring. basically hunch Americans Covid data suggests hypothetical numbers plus vaccine distribution we‚Äôll hit herd immunity April. That‚Äôd great that‚Äôs two months! He‚Äôs giving permission. He‚Äôs telling likelihood pass deadly disease relatives thought 95% vaccinated number infection cases declined one percent? business. Canada could taken gamble America (aka sign contracts vaccine even phase 3 trial). risk, happened pay off. doubtful bird flu cause major problems. scares kind thing every years.

There going pandemics future, ""pandemic"" automatically mean ""everyone completely gives life year"". 

Covid ways worst-case-scenario highly contagious mild people (so continue go lives it), causes severe illness enough people (mostly elderly) hospitals risk overwhelmed nothing. 

If disease bit less contagious, bit less likely spread people mild symptoms, bit less likely lead hospitalization, large-scale restrictions would needed. think sub really overestimates amount people don‚Äôt wear masks. Like I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different different places I‚Äôve seen literally 3 people store without mask since April Hand washing based Science. single reported case due someone washing hands. please show us case. government censorship infringing constitutional rights ‚Äúgood news‚Äù. Got it. seems impossible variants don‚Äôt know enough about, effective vaccines them. right, even crazier said comment haha. :( hope get see soon. Sure months do. People going want lives back. We‚Äôre boiling life covid avoidance studies found asymptomatic cases less transmissible. 

[Asymptomatic infections far less likely transmit symptomatic ones cause relative risk (RR) asymptomatic transmission 42% lower symptomatic Lol 1 case per 100k yellow tier even normal. Things like sporting events theme parks 25% capacity think indoor bars even open.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people like knowing risk killing parents. want that, one cares caring whether live die obvious first post inconveniencing ‚Äúkeep others warm‚Äù - meant alive. 

Not everyone nihilistic you. us want see aging parents survive see kids graduate. 

Hell, that‚Äôs assuming survive. person knew 50, healthy died. thing doesn‚Äôt kill elderly. Minority 500k still Hundreds Thousands 65. 

Of people ventilators went appt, 55. 

You‚Äôre treating 1 0. live die. reality is, it‚Äôs new disease affecting people surprising ways. 

One thing clear. parents survival priority. people want they‚Äôre parents around longer. Different strokes. 7-day average 1 million January 14th per link. 

What think you‚Äôre seeing reporting gotten better (daily vs weekly) many states. ‚ÄúMuh Socialized healthcare‚Äù really thing based (and obesity, Canada statistically pretty darn fat too). Fingers crossed eh? Gangnam style Trump‚Äôs vaccine rollout plan used Biden administration. makes think NY reopened bit summer missed chance. lots restaurants closed. I‚Äôve screaming day 1 They've doctors offices years yes really used Take random survey deaths apply actuarial values. 

One study I've seen (old) claimed average person die covid 1 year less life remaining average person age. videos US people still wearing masks even reach herd immunity going awesome, Karens telling people mask people dying covid. new management exact rollout plan previous administration had, nothing it. nice try. raw death rate number same, population Europe significantly higher. look per capita basis, Europe still significantly better USA, due (prior) government response population adherence. Yeah blamed Trudeau vaccine issue. done blame for? reason you? rate really start pick consistent way January. lockdown wasn‚Äôt help old people. prevent hospitals reaching capacity among things. feel like young people targeted ton young people ignoring rules partying. also plenty people older shit though. sucks mostly everyone. 

Young people losing school, fun/carefree times, social opportunities, etc. 

People losing jobs turn losing healthcare.

People lost love ones lost time loved ones. 

I think everyone wants feel heard things they‚Äôve going through. everyone wants people acknowledge sacrifices made. little brother high school feel horrible stain experience, lot friends struggling. It‚Äôs tough impossible situation. hand lost jobs mental health great. I‚Äôm ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù empathize feeling pushed aside ignored. 

I kind rambled maybe missed point really want say I‚Äôm sorry haven‚Äôt felt appreciated sacrifices. glad got enjoy outside people love. hope you‚Äôll able get back routines soon. seriously arguing we'd better private healthcare like USA?

You literally can't canadian. one stupid enough think that's better alternative. Agreed, even question. fucked reason Canada rely countries vaccine Can't really disagree that, get impression somehow dishonest. think know, people pressing hard _some_ kind deadline (a reasonable thing ask), puts tight spot people assume estimates somehow meant taken extremely definitive. 

We know - optimistic lethal, pessimistic end one taking things seriously - also lethal. seems like ""middle-road"" approach doing: ""We really know, ideally X Y, may longer, hopefully this, hopefully vaccinate many people Z,"" on. know people big cities else lol im wearing mask case counts low enough vaccines. Also Fauci said possible, likely.   Thank showing compassion.. it‚Äôs end world means far things go, certainly disheartening lose freedom ‚Äúdiscover yourself‚Äù meet people could lifelong friends college years Check www.covidactnow.org, don‚Äôt know got you‚Äôre source it‚Äôs completely wrong Fucking embarrassing, Canada!!! Wtf It‚Äôs weird timely comment is. It‚Äôs like world set brilliant play words Can‚Äôt return normal USA? Like good 30% people want vaccine, going start seeing use ""vaccine passport"" kind. want go movies? prove vaccinated go right in. otherwise, nope. etc.. 
   
Lol yeah except businesses realize going cutting 40% customer base afford so. theory yes, yet people like Ted Cruz somehow still office regardless decisions made. Directly, decision me. ate tiny cramped waffle house today. awesome tbh. profitable....? likely get vaccinated less 3 months. Especially comorbidities older. Oh lockdown? Wow one thought before. Thank much, mind = blown. conservatives socialize Healthcare system led vaccine creation manufacturing unprofitable?   We'll cross bridge come it. There's data yet, obviously, logic points towards longer duration efficacy, worry possibility case unless there's evidence it. long hypothetical, government's job worry it. Nothing do. JCVI world leading apolitical committee advising UK government. approved vaccine use based upon strong trial data younger adults strong immunological data older adults, absolutely concern safety.

The main arbiters concern AZ vaccine initially came poorly researched hit piece German press ignorant offhand comment Macron. Since EU approval committees hedged bets upon significant media focus. EU reccomend use AZ vaccine age groups.

If EU swimming abundance mRNA vaccines attitude would understandable, they're not. killing people political capital. fair, US far best country world scientist, engineer, tech even close. know enough Canada say things true, kind brainer move hours south get ~55% pay raise. Someone Vancouver moving Seattle would hell lot closer family American, they'd rich enough classic ""problems"" America really relevant you. course.. reservoirs COVID-19 countries enough vaccines untenable. invites virus mutation bypasses current vaccine another pandemic. even accounting effects traded travel. world connected. Yeah, nobody would bought 2020, even COVID hit buy-in would mixed weeks ago JJ Watt already left Texas. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much do. None people needed die. depraved nation. Back normal summer matter what. Look New Zealand. Life continuing like normal mostly, personal sacrifice case happen, several weeks complete lock down. whole world done that, talking fast vaccine distributed virus would eliminated. persists finding new hosts. Stop spreading goes away completely. require full aggressive lock everyone cooperating. ""my freedoms"" crowd ""it's like flu"" crowd still day refuse wear mask, would living lives like normal right now. 
So that's personal sacrifice, everyone actually obey strict lock weeks would gone. I've charge several large projects lifetime. pretty easy step gigantic operations type project critique first thing perfect.

E.g. brought massive software project involving 100s developers across world. product, system , agile methodologies place, several shortfalls areas.

ONLY priority given priorities changed constantly. former CTO told much shit get joined, amazing.

Yet someone new step shit hard work 1000s.

I firmly believe exactly Biden's admin met reaction.

Probably pisssed 100s 1000s persons process. Yep exactly feel too.

It would great honest people would ""return normal"" know would case. Canada, one Sanofi's candidates failed, started manufacturing Pfizer. even need to? 75-80% likely threshold herd immunity, almost 10% US population already Covid, death hospitalization rates people 18yo negligible. think ""100% population vaccinated"" reasonable target getting things back normal. like cant look mortality rates centenarians say ""oh look bad pandemic extremely old people compared everyone else!"" mortality rate before?  move asia love much That‚Äôs ‚Äúbecoming lazy‚Äù that‚Äôs weight lifting shoulders bit normalcy let back life. Hopefully we‚Äôll feel way things year now! Thanks hard work. Exactly, equivalent attorney general Ecuador two days ago asked secretary health include workers department current round vaccinations, elderly healthcare workers. work remotely. mutation could happen decades ahead us. worries eventually well used you‚Äôre replying to, would society naturally trend way? Wow. 1 month plan amazing success! Truly unbelievable referring fact Canada receiving European mfg sites. US product used US, worry supplies like do. simply fact cannot make own. I'm talking nationalistic policies somehow promote exceptionalism. People tendency put tribal groups ahead general welfare. war. War never good average sometimes benefits winner.

Nationalism populism ugly sides society. know many people think good things. think unfortunate consequence evolved aggressive apes. absolutely leave UK paid first 100 million doses Astrazaneca adhering contract signed time... Nothing nationalism. reckon find UK US much Novavax program poorer countries likes Germany... much EU given program again? I'll wait.

Sorry allowed EU commission oversee vaccine roll took 3 months longer save cents. think understand original point. Comparing groups part picture also look change time. probably say risk profile leaders. Trump, Boris et al preprared gamble vaccine early. also prepared gamble risk virus regard citizens health. don‚Äôt disagree. possibility groups could reduce funding response. saying would likely possibility, would still possibility. that‚Äôs enough explain decision beyond saying it‚Äôs bad DJT bad.

Once again, I‚Äôm Trump fan think he‚Äôs worst President we‚Äôve ever had, don‚Äôt think every decision made awful don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs productive make judgments hindsight certain situations. see lot info coming Pfizer vaccine possibly stopping transmission. Would fair say Pfizer one does, Moderna well? it, 10 sets AMRAP curls said ""open season vaccines would April"" the. turned ""may/June"" ""by late July"".

I think happened (direct quotes Fauci):

‚ÄúAs get March April, number available doses allow much mass vaccination approach,‚Äù said Thursday Today show.

‚ÄúI would imagine **by time get April**, would call, better wording, ‚Äò**open season**,‚Äô‚Äù said. ‚ÄúNamely, **virtually everybody anybody category could start get vaccinated**.‚Äù

But **doesn‚Äôt mean everybody get vaccinated April, said Fauci**, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases adviser President Joe Biden. logistics getting vaccine arms, mid- late summer Americans vaccinated, said.

The vaccine available mobile clinics pharmacies enlisted inoculate people, said.

Also Thursday, Biden said government signed contracts 100 million doses Moderna vaccine 100 million doses Pfizer vaccine. Dates vaccine delivery also moved up, said.

‚Äú**That means we‚Äôre track enough supply 300 million Americans end July**,‚Äù said remarks National Institutes Health. carrot positive incentive get something. don‚Äôt agree way it, Israel example, hard. 

The CDC encouraging vaccinated people return normal life within limits legally allowed(and US places it‚Äôs quite bit) encouraging elderly visit family would carrot getting vaccine. UK, General Practitioners (GP) doctors, surgery takes patients certain area usually within 3 mile ish radius surgery address. go clients refer vaccination clinics post, age group selected. everyone vaccinated currently UK, unless work healthcare, case jobs referred vaccination. People peel hot chilli peppers 100x less likely catch coronavirus. tend rub eyes all. thing I'd add, facilities used produce AZ could swapped quickly producing one mrna vaccines similar costs probably that.

At particular time look what's best going forward, could moving production capabilities best products. get work done car last summer. Afterwards, cleaned steering wheel, seat, etc. drive home extra cautious wore mask touch face. face itched horribly whole way back. long drive.

I envy ability use hands face. got source 2-3 pre-existing conditions? Yeah wouldn‚Äôt trade places, even though it‚Äôs frustrating watching slow deliveries lately. Thank nice. He's puppet parents elderly. average redditor, parents age.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  know what, reading posts gonna give cancer I'm gonna dip out. Enjoy life. agree prudent. However one many complaints Trump federal guidance states point making decisions. want Biden actually give state something use make decisions! he‚Äôs saying holy cow good shape Please provide source ""on average 3 serious health conditions.""

I high degree confidence misrepresenting information actually true like ""the average death 3 co-morbidities"" including things like sepsis, pneumonia slew COVID-19 induced conditions. Stop lying, get flight US. take test. cheek fragile cotton swab?

The amount whining people can‚Äôt lift finger save someone else‚Äôs life truly toddler level. Actually take back, toddlers much less selfish. flu bit different though. First take guess flu(s) make vaccine for. Also understanding flu vax nowhere near 95% efficacy.  Downvote want I‚Äôm tired listening man. doesn‚Äôt seem know he‚Äôs talking many times contradicted himself. Thank you. First rational answer. *Protestant* work ethic become thing?? Absolutely. 25 days. go back gym. Everyone Denmark wants inoculated Covid-19 given chance June 27th

That's great true. live another EU country presumably share supply EU deal june 27th sounds optimistic. know supply rate increase april may really much? Denmark side deal extra vaccines outside EU deal? FDA greenlights change, warmer storage conditions could dramatically ease vaccine distribution, allowing doses sent non-specialized vaccine administration sites. change would also make much easier distribute vaccine low-income countries.

So there's  Yeah is. That‚Äôs negative side. shows zero understanding cost Canada. So, feels like you‚Äôve made point it‚Äôs extremely insensitive social, economic mental costs incurred. 

You talk financial support. Canada destroyed many small businesses zero support beyond token ‚Äúrent support‚Äù.

Canada‚Äôs corporate subsidies keep people payrolls overwhelmingly went large companies like Bell Canada making huge money collective zoomathons. 

Small business destroyed numbers don‚Äôt exist US. 

So yeah, look society total Canada doesn‚Äôt shine brightly. Oh hell, forgot one. Seriously, fire him. I‚Äôve seen decent articles suggesting ‚ÄúFOR KIDS‚Äù Covid less fatal flu. guess is, convincing enough ppl, quite enough younger kids. absence long term studies tho, it‚Äôs hard judge. fighting isn‚Äôt going end anytime soon. surprised US, UK Israel took risks outbid everyone. Meanwhile eu negotiating prices Canada never really massive industrial revolution phase Vaccine acceptance many people glossing over, something Fauci not. even mentions interview, possible may need masks we're dealing COVID + Influenza fall. legit concern can't brushed rug protect feelings. people talking still wipe groceries

You eat box crackers, eat crackers lol evidence transmissible food great people wipe groceries fear fomite transmission, still rare covid course. absolutely absurd. data COVID-19 illness among children indicate literally less dangerous influenza. can't possibly expect hysterical reaction child slightest risk going convince people must comply. mask shaming must, get ready people laugh you. I‚Äôm sure many reasons, give one example - I‚Äôm claustrophobic, even almost year wearing mask sometimes makes feel panicky. absolutely still wear one course, can‚Äôt wait get rid it. Again, one example - get would hard understand someone experience something like that. I'm Canadian, question this: fuck vaccines?!?!?! Newfoundland received all, nobody province vaccinated, super outbreak (for us) last 2 weeks quadruple cases ever entire time this...and single fucking vaccine anywhere seen

what fuck?!?! arguments sake 75% population gets vaccinated offers 85% protection, everyone goes maskless, would end cases? (To include vaccinated)

I understand many unknowns, like long vaccine last? covid eventually go away, like flu? suppose need wait year hope goes away. American works biotech, see shitloads Canadians. Canadian semblance brain get Visa US. fucking do! wages complete shit, brain-drain real. Tell work. Pharmaceutical companies recipe sell recipe get kick back dose. thing? Kinda like franchise get shit quickly r/shitamericanssay think it‚Äôs result vaccine development going fast could. probably picked safe temperature didn‚Äôt time test various temperature options trial started. end Phase 3 results prove efficacy product storage -70C, becomes difficult change untested storage temperature (the problem increasing time doses). IIRC they‚Äôve trying determine safety efficacy higher storage temperatures months, always problem Pfizer compared competitor vaccines. ""insufficient studies"" line nonsense point. tons data vaccine dramatically reduces chances transmitting virus, see, Go ahead shame bro lol. won‚Äôt wearing one believe point ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù clearly nationalist jingoistic. Nice attempt deflection though since liking dogs nothing national policy nationalist does. (Oh sense brought Hitler, look nationalism got allies). Why? problem literally nothing spare right now. us sharing right now, nothing. 

This one those, put oxygen mask first help others situations. said, soon US reaches appropriate level immunity want us give leftovers surpluses Canada Mexico. need neighbors. think governments around world trying cover missteps. I've heard BBC still refers AZ vaccine 90% effective. 

What know Pfizer take US money all. deliver doses US government fulfillment contracts. US government actually control plants. even look TV doses packed plants inside Pfizer production campuses get delivered like FedEx US government takes possession.

I personally feel there's lot pressure around world people governments point fingers deflect blame. around world really. something 'reasons' Ah, see. Thanks answer honest question. Glad hear vulnerable elderly front line workers getting far. Hope supply chain keeps rolling nicely coming months. especially makes sense LAST WEEK said herd immunity summer....so heck would wear masks herd immunity?! couple months herd immunity 2022?!?! vaccines rushed know reality that's is. going safe possible conservative possible implementation. highly confident safe effective though said that. enough shown verify Covid rules coming across surprise? dealing inconveniencies year. Misleading title, sixth 'extra' dose vials coming caveat. I'm Canadian can't blame minute. would *pissed* Canada sending away vaccines them; would hold another country different standard? makes us important citizens waiting? can‚Äôt people saying ‚Äúbubble‚Äù vaccinated still need wear masks gather together indoors due ‚Äúinsufficient studies transferring virus vaccinated‚Äù. point vaccinated?!?!? stop pushing idea people vaccinated? I'm sure plenty places discuss Israel Palestine politics sub one them. meanwhile Massachusetts, dangerous bar serve food magically okay. love knee-jerk reaction canadian posters smug blame US. can‚Äôt wait feeling Except time US literally blame. nothing countries offering vaccine free. Well, can‚Äôt change headline. definitely wanted share interview itself. thought things said indications great news. 

He may seemed hesitant, wouldn‚Äôt be, now, insane virus turned us inside upside down? I‚Äôd hesitant say aloud ‚ÄúDing dong wicked witch dead‚Äù too. But... I‚Äôm damn well inside. would still love live Canada instead US. really proud 500k death 30MM+ infections?  Thank you. work local hospital (not frontline, still higher risk jobs) I've super cautious, especially since we've B117 variant area. There's not. We've quarter worldwide cases, fifth worldwide deaths, we've gotten 26% vaccines. We've gotten one (1) fucking thing entire year that's better developed countries gotten, even one thing excessive, *fair* based case numbers, late half million us, people still want shit us it. Old people, sick people, people risky jobs get prioritized vaccination everyone understands that, Americans get prioritized vaccination *near-exact proportion* share crisis suddenly nationalism? Suddenly country worst time supposed help everyone else? Universal healthcare ability stay home without starving becoming homeless defaulting debt extortionate education system enough rest you? need us divvy one good thing too?

Fuck that. deserve every dose vaccine we've gotten. I'm scared bringing something back parents tho is. honestly unprecedented. No. didn‚Äôt. plan Chrump. Also actual virus capitalist opportunity. lot people made lot money pandemic.

The demographics suffered ones well overlap.

This isn‚Äôt coincidence. without question influenced policy. admit enjoying less recognizable public, reasons make sad. u/twoeggs0verhard known covid denier/minimizer American, I'm glad something right once. Probably developing kickass lobstah traps building vacation homes Bostonians. 

LL Bean makes really good shit tho There's major calls provinces (namely Ontario) introduce legally mandatory paid sick days. seem unlikely pass long Doug Ford premier.

Not sure provinces matter, Ontario approaching half Canada's population, issues impact massive number Canadians. surprising. Boston world's hub biotech institute export ban COVID vaccines, course leading way vaccine numbers. 

Calling Canada's vaccine rollout ""mishandling things cataclysmic level"" buying PostMedia propaganda. Pending approval AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax Health Canada, contracts set [24 million Canadians vaccinated end delays Pfizer needed upgrade EU production facilities people started extrapolating data rest year. mean, yeah, Canadian military, working US.

Not exactly choice returned. Expecting government pick bill folks got stationed foreign countries seems pretty reasonable. won‚Äôt stay rate... Seems extreme doom headlining here. vaccine strong enough vs current variants wipe disease everyone gets - year discovery disease!? words properly convey amazing is.

And article takes shit logistics problem getting 5 doses bottle instead 6? people fit criteria still struggling find dose.

Not pedantic, we've vaccinated literally everyone wants always people trouble finding dose. Unless go weeks without able find one. Presumably like nationalism...but after?  This. Exactly. Exactly. Dude they‚Äôre literally scientific studies! What??  Unfortunately think happen now. makes sense UK, especially considering closeness nations boarder, economic ties free movement. could easily done.

Previously government said wanted share EU shut down. Apparently EU happy UK excess Ireland said either illegal would reduce vaccines amount recieves.

Irish minister health also said interested look outside EU.

Over last couple days UK pledged vaccines poor nations reduced timescale vaccinate adults That's happens six months people bombarded scare tactics.

It's people's fault, institutions broke them. tables turned muahhahahahaaha. jokes aside, hope Canada recovers soon! **Clarifications Rantings**



There confusion posts, thinking I'm anti-restrictions whatever. Actually, I've getting sides.

The virus serious business. kills people. makes people sick long time. people lose sense smell/taste. people get sick all, *no idea* why. Yes, I'm ignoring age distribution stuff here, know people every age *can* get really sick. really want loss smell taste happen me. That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose, spite me* there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices.

The virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up. 

If think ""defending"" China, beyond help.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever. Masking easy, yeah, suck, anymore. I'm ""pro-mask"" point. seem work, myriad reasons. Double masking dumb, idea comes good intentions. Experts [trying hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING protect people deadly virus. really difficult you, I'm sorry. 

Please assume troll argue conservative subs I'm conservative. I'll get banned eventually. keep restrictions place protect anti-vaxxers. decline vaccine get covid problem.

Also, messaging Fauci like article going increase number people decline vaccine. can't get back normal vaccination, lot people wonder point vaccine. Absolutely correct. 

Damned do, damned don‚Äôt. Every single time conservative governments? 400 000 sitting freezers. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've Said saying. Saying Said?

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? Could maybe [this US?]( vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

Oh goodness. like read comments something...  nothing it. selfish countries able buy vaccines like us. slower EU least they're trying ensure every country gets fair share, gets vulnerable vaccinated. 

Frankly whole fuck everyone citizens mentality disgusts me, surprise, that's way US always been. deliveries, hogging Pfizer production go family‚Äôs decades long hugging policy. Hugging leads emotions. Can‚Äôt that. easily wrong thing turn sound bite

Lol true however also reduced vaccine deliveries throughout Europe. handful countries like Israel United States affected shortage vaccines due priority agreements.

Things get better soon. numbers past days good I'm sure we're bored. forget celebrate little win! Fewer deaths? Good! vaccinations? Woo hooo! Fewer positives? YEAAAH!

The best links starred. * didn‚Äôt pharmaceutical company Canada invent version vaccine? Dozens pharma companies around globe come version. There‚Äôs really reason US companies aren‚Äôt letting Canada produce doses. manufacturing process definitely super complex, highly doubt Canada unable it. world leader secure dosages wherever use manufacturers one messes up. one mistake pfizer breaks rollout suck good contingency plan that‚Äôs case, think worrying call *undue* stress. focus important parts :) IIRC, mRNA vaccine facilities. course, COVID vaccines mRNA based, we've seen extremely effective technique creating modifying new vaccines quickly.

We [plans create new vaccine facility long ways away one going mRNA vaccines (but *does* COVID vaccine -- last heard -- expected approved here).

But yeah, we're front line dependent countries supply us vaccines. plus side, ordered ton probably expect among first enough vaccines everyone countries domestic manufacturing. Certainly we're going better vast majority countries (I mean, there's small handful countries domestic manufacturing -- justify us domestic manufacturing, especially since Canada *should* focused high tech industries). USA Canada actually halts spread. Awesome! That's helpful though. sounds like kids shitty situation, that's gonna make feel worse it, literally can't anything change it. things going well Canada, y'all always quite smug. things go sideways, somehow US always blame. kids 12+, I'm hoping vaccine approval administered school opening fall. understand anxiety parents younger kids vaccine. know they're less susceptible symptoms, can't wonder causing additional underlying problems. one thing they're socially distanced infection rate mitigated, open completely without restrictions kids top may become problem.

That said, elementary schools opened fully months ago, albeit strict restrictions, despite middle high schools staying closed. They've shut school completely once, quarantine several classes couple times too. sure well pan get vaccinated rest nation lifted restrictions. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs (supposed be) biggest priority every country planet right doses order quite different doses arms, though. whole Europe manages vaccinate vast majority adults summer great. Plus 3.8% vaccination far. mother too. Amazing happen get people government take jobs seriously. Like night day. It‚Äôs matter prioritization demand, too. good neighbors alone, making sure high risk Canadians get shots high risk Americans done, especially demand distribution isn‚Äôt able keep supply, hitting 5 million shots day soon. 

Part there‚Äôs ~38 million Canadians, too. won‚Äôt take long get 10 million high risk Canadians (assuming similar numbers US) vaccinated, especially can‚Äôt get shots arms rate production. thought Canada superior US every way, possible? what's definition ""our""? Yes. I'm kidding. people like feel it, people like ""safety belt"" aspect it, people (kinda sad guess) feel mask hides appearance covers flaws. Saw getting vaccinated. large portion gone (mentally many left long ago) time younger folks start get vaccinated. 

It's family, patients doctors often decided sending hospitals got infected. Even survive, they'll left bad state painful. changing environment Alzheimer's patients really hard them. Damn, never thought way. really nail understand statistics. I‚Äôm giving information accurate. 

You‚Äôre welcome. agree Canada dropped ball far vaccine production capability shouldn‚Äôt rely America bail us out, also would like see examples Canadian government insulting unsupportive wealthiest nation history planet? German politicians (not many) full-scapegoat mode. They've relying better US UK. Even speedy vaccine approach sold reckless desparation. EU boss von der Leyen even audacity accuse Pfizer price-gouging order find excuses horrible performance EUs vaccine drive. Israel gold standard. US UK silver best. Lets politicians vote lockdown actually live laws create. travel get paid stimulus check.Do say, do. I‚Äôm teacher. don‚Äôt make decisions. virus still circulating kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated, can‚Äôt go completely back normal people feel like district says.

You would say it‚Äôs ‚Äúanother parents hysteria,‚Äù would say someone advocating full reopen precautions ‚Äúignoring science.‚Äù school board supposed do. That‚Äôs noting wrong picture. We‚Äôll share vaccine doses people willing take them. really lot people subreddit think United States obligated ensure everyone European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, gets vaccinated government ensures citizens gets vaccinated.

What hell sending $50,000,000,000 foreign aid around world every year for? never enough. We're always one blame. cases skyrocketing? United States awful. we're vaccinating people deal skyrocketing cases? United States awful. send masks internationally even though domestic shortages? United States awful. keep masks deal shortages? United States awful. 

It's exhausting. many legitimate reasons adamantly dislike government United States, sometimes feels understandable grow completely apathetic towards international opinion. matter United States does, it'll seen problem. pandemic, basically every aspect international politics. almost easy understand there's growing sense isolationism within country, even results would probably pretty bad overall. feels like matter United States does, reputation set stone villain. frustrating. Yeah same. also find better stop rest stops even though one says need go. agree, given foot-dragging goalpost-moving we‚Äôve seen continue see reopening, person still vastly preferable fraud hybrid Zoom, even masks. I‚Äôd rather open masks open all. 

I also think it‚Äôs important get fully open, people see doesn‚Äôt result end world, dead teachers piled streets, whatever fear-mongering nonsensical scenarios people keep pushing. local district opened full-on silly safety theater, little while, lot relaxed became apparent useless silly was. Back full 2019 school, yet, we‚Äôre heck lot closer lot towns around us. Gotta start somewhere. might able maybe possibly entertain thought almost starting begin suggest return normalcy 2070 Well, enough work maybe stop death natural causes. replied comment edit. 

Only 17% population 65+.

Now calculate percentage hospitalizations 65+.

In fact, look first CDC link posted want math. posting links screenshots saying ""no"". Yes, americans known for, patience ‚Äî severe winter storms devastated Texas surrounding states delayed distribution 6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday it‚Äôs ‚Äútemporary setback‚Äù fixed middle week. play pretty good catch-up,‚Äù Fauci, head director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said interview ""Meet Press."" President Joe Biden declared major disaster 77 counties across state , allowing areas eligible federal recovery funds, emergency management officials calling entire state included disaster declaration. Okay loser Canadians exports US vaccines people willing take them. we‚Äôll take care people first. don‚Äôt like build manufacturing plants develop IP.  demonstrably is. Go easy drugs. No, didn't. Look many leaders wore masks soon found helped, look much longer (if all) took US Republicans same. made masks ""anti-freedom"" convinced tens millions boot-lickers proudly go without.

Best news ever. Capitalist / Commercial mindset. vaccine production/logistical challenge. actual virus welfare/humanitarian crisis. US (I'm US) nails things like production logistics. fails taking care people. Probably not... Hmmmm... Like one ""probably"" die contract Covid. 

Telling able discuss one thing time argue small point rather broader point. Almost like speaking position good faith. Almost like *you* already decided virus something *you* going let change anything you. 500,000+ US deaths later, still care, desperately need right, big deal, everyone must weak. doctor infected also handle fluid used positive test? Could source infection along? Canadian here! Yes, it‚Äôs frustrating I‚Äôm confident things start ramp up. Everyone know works doctor nurse vaccinated sister (works administration health clinic - front line regular contact front line workers) getting first dose today! coming, although wait hard especially comparing countries.  read headline, laboratory results. real world results completed confirmed 89.4% effective preventing laboratory-confirmed infections

As far know studies actual transmission inconclusive:

The latest studies basically indicated reduce viral load, said variation viral load person person large say reduction effective. Like one person significant reduction vaccine, viral load may still someone without Though vaccinated people appear less likely transmit virus, **it remains unclear much transmission could still happen**. That‚Äôs people‚Äôs viral load vary widely general; **the reported decrease viral loads vaccinated people small compared range viral levels experts seen COVID-19 patients**, Kilpatrick It‚Äôs also important note **the studies show ‚Äúa snapshot viral loads,‚Äù representing much virus person carried single point time**, says. 

So take article, data taken one snapshot time. There's evidence reduced load, broadly, insignificant viral load range large individuals. read may reduce 20-30% (just example, see numbers put amount reduced), someone high viral load 20-30% reduction still people fully infected unvaccinated.

The way truly tell controlled experiment, put bunch vaccinated people close proximity vaccinated human challenge trial. Otherwise results fairly circumstantial.

Just saying mean burn masks hug every stranger soon we're vaccinated. Maybe time didn‚Äôt talked grumpy person. I‚Äôm sure overwhelmed. can‚Äôt hurt keep trying. Good luck! not? 20x many highly effective vaccines administered day number people testing positive. That's HUGE. time reopen. Friday. got one second shot canada. else prove it? thing getting proof shot (flu, tetanus, etc) assume do, honestly hope everyone world gets vaccine soon. It‚Äôs tough situation aren‚Äôt enough. thought common knowledge course still wearing 2022 itll long goes away. words person mean nothing then. society. That's truee. People shit United States want, lot countries scale things level put heart. think UK's vaccination numbers skewed given priority giving one dose completely vaccinated individuals yeah seem good job too. Oh FFS provide differing information simply explain changed cause information differ.

Or can't provide specifics due lack information, dont provide specifics.

Or simply dont fucking know, say so. [No discrepancies across US insane. New York New Jersey could vaccinated literally right now. super frustrating. Canadian military, working US. able go home year. live alone family back Canada. know logistically *can* go back home. Canada keeps dropping ball means even longer. Exactly. clinical trial, 15% people fever vaccine, side effect 10-15% occurrence. fact matters, Moderna/Pfizer 2 dose vaccine 95% effective. don‚Äôt worry it. think it‚Äôs good lesson self reliance. US needs vastly better job vaccinating. current rate take years it, months. U.K. definition ‚Äúoffered‚Äù means given opportunity vaccinated, make appointment.

The reason say ‚Äúoffered‚Äù instead ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù antivaxx crowd use say vaccinations become mandatory. ..For loser later win 
For times a-changin' . Run semester longer classes shorter length much Pfizer Moderna said going increase distribution, doubt going take long. Almost 1/5th adult population already received atleast one shot. I'm even Canadian, I'm American. think bizarre thing give pat back since populations vastly different. Im 26 immune system garbage. get Im gonna done Yeah no. ""YAY! Restaurants 40% instead 30% capacity!"" cut it. That's significant improvement. Biden visited Bob Dole person yesterday. Bob Dole 97 stage 4 lung cancer.

If thought even slight chance could still transmit COVID vaccinated, really think would‚Äôve made trip?

The vaccine personal off-ramp know it. don‚Äôt want take stance publicly it‚Äôs widely available administered, unvaccinated people can‚Äôt claim gotten shot order give safety guidelines early.

All ‚Äúno normalcy many many months talk‚Äù behavioral management doctors politicians. change mid late Spring. Mission. Accomplished. personal decision indeed. totally understand take, selfish point view I'd rather wait months level risk last year (""the devil know""), hoping fend virus bit longer, enjoy almost full protection would convince enjoy social life travelling again; rather safer wait 2022 get semblance normal life back. mentioned, I'll take AZ anyway. mostly think right thing collective point view.

About J&amp;J, thing available yet. were, opinion would similar. Reducing number variants occur precisely health officials indicating vaccinating everyone. Early data seems suggest vaccinated people don‚Äôt transmit (though data needed sure). Long-COVID also real. 

Reopening function Rt 1. second link reflects said, too.

I'm willing listen actually see something counters pointed out. US still much better job needs improve 2-3 times get summer would keep mask mandates beyond point everyone wants vaccine gotten it? seem ""goalpost"" could aim beyond that. read article? almost surreal see United States United Kingdom looked gold standard Europe Canada seen places mishandling things cataclysmic level. complete reversal past year weird see public attitude shifts coming it. hate bearer bad news, believe catch covid eating food, salad out. need something detach virus lettuce, like soap, scrub inch lettuce create friction move virus away. 

A simple wash won‚Äôt anything coronavirus. technically *can* way seatbelts airbags guarantee survive car accident. ignore tremendously increased odds *will* survive one silly.

The vaccines stop contagion, stop enough contagion stop spread. every piece data points easily accomplishing some. think see public mask mandates lift vaccine readily available anyone wants it. probably early summer. Probably not, unless she‚Äôs immunosuppressant drugs. reopening achieve herd immunity. Governor Baker never vote 2022, even less now. well written thought process logical.  I'm educated enough know whether premises right.  demonize individuals coming conclusion describe. Imagine, free press! No. Check CDC (second) link full hospitalization numbers. You‚Äôll see. fell behind took brunt production slowdown, unfortunately. No. Gotta free spit cashier suppose selfish say American, agree sending American manufactured vaccines elsewhere millions people literally dying get one. agree shift international codependency general, think makes much sense actively angry United States. anger Canadian government using past year increase domestic manufacturing capabilities.

Canada part United States. option put Canadian resident higher priority American resident. understand makes sense act like case. Canadian government spent large portion pandemic incredibly dismissive frankly insulting condition United States' public health, really much effort helping material terms entire period. United States feel obligated react differently Canada we're ones better position?

It comes across double standard me. love Canada want see things go well them, dose Canadian right dose going American, that's objective situation, going stay way large number people vaccinated. I'm seeing reason risk lives people another country adequately prepare this. wrong. Definitely. happen believe nations entered agreement distribute vaccines population evenly. 

The problem politics probably aware got rid divisive President (just barely) basically unsuccessful coup attempt. dangerous situation giving vaccines others risks giving extreme right even ammunition. Wearing mask vaccinated people around nothing careful listening science rather everything paranoid Yeah still remember good ol' days Western health authorities proudly claimed MaSkS dOnt wOrk FlU br0. politics long sub yes, course removed. important Fauci honest public. Good that. Historically pandemics last couple years Wow.. wow common sure, actually same, bit worse, first shot. I'm certain side effects. Nope, also large amount randomness. bad limited symptoms. Stop normalizing germaphobia. frustrating times another interview gave regards seeing daughter said need cut back message still Worried something that‚Äôs justifiable.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* multiple sources continue say careful wash hands touching various types surfaces, help protect contracting Covid-19, bother according nervous contracting HIV touching things public. Ok, thanks. Yeah high false negative rate. story back celebrity sure covid took like 4 5 antibody tests one finally came back positive. mostly agree except half covid-related hospitalizations people age 65. high-risk, working British person received AZ though available locally called, worry lucky enough able job home minimise exposure right now, things reopen unlikely allowed continue so. part feels waited still stay home. I‚Äôm concerned simply won‚Äôt able access higher degree protection indefinitely, people position viewed unfortunate collateral. I‚Äôm still truly sure made right decision situation not. 

Perhaps won‚Äôt matter much uptake high enough (which looking really good UK far) transmission falls significantly. really really hope so. expect national post, 2 sentences? Safe assume Moderna too? Yep, arguing family member get vaccine cases deaths trickle (more deaths car accidents COVID example, bad flu season) go back normal exact words were, ""I bet Fauci come say wear masks even happens!"". Thanks lot Dr. Fauci... idea making less likely people rush get vaccine...even get it. Explain wrong then. get fruit lettuce, wash it. ""fresh"" salad prepared person? thank you. Congrats stupidest person website ... that's saying something. particular commenter unbiased result runs counter China's absurd narrative covid may first arrived China piece frozen food another country. Stupid title didn‚Äôt say said possible. Also says would increasingly relaxed based vaccination efforts. friends phones. friends live many different countries, particular people still facebook for. I'm UK honestly know last time sent text message, perhaps 3+ years ago? _do sometimes_ make phone calls, occasionally. 

Please read message again, never said _couldn't_ - something actively wanted unable do. 

As aside, moderate content stop platform become publisher mean basically see post dropping numbers every day. think people upvoting it‚Äôs becoming norm. person talking people find random restaurants may get vaccine EOD, people may begin eat slight hopes get vaccine luck.  estimated 1/3 population infected, people infected mostly ones social contacts. 13% vaccine. Together, numbers quite enough full herd immunity, enough significantly slow virus. Newsom danger recalled. 

Even Cuomo isn‚Äôt extreme him. person talking people find random restaurants may get vaccine EOD, people may begin eat slight hopes get vaccine luck. Banning lobbyism, universal health care, attaching health care employment statuses Everyone knows can't catch COVID 10pm, get test immune 96 hours.

(Psst, security theater)  good shit Canada memeing president dropping ball, guess better investment would domestic letter representing government, huh? $2 billion cash 2 years time help anybody get vaccines now. Quit bullshit. Ok, I'll reword then. looked multiple sources recently half hour ago, multiple sources continue say Covid-19 survive surfaces platic, wood, metals, glass, cardboard (etc)....so therefore take care wash hands minimum 20 seconds handling things. 

I see way taking that, except virus survive surfaces, infect us. Americans wear masks now? /s Three anecdotes ‚â† trend. HIV survives surfaces quite too. nervous contracting HIV touching things public?  Exactly. remember Canadians making fun Americans months go. doubt still that. Likely get voted lot could see parts country keeping mask mandates least December 2021 case sort 4th wave. could also see jobs, schools, etc requiring it.

Our area opened schools yet worried hwo fall would go. people willing require masks schools fully reopen fall. don‚Äôt think expect continue dropping rate. interesting see happens hospitalizations get around 28,000 nationwide. first two waves, hospitalizations dropped low 28,000 started trending again. There‚Äôs nothing magic number, seems point recovery people start getting comfortable start acting stupid terms social distancing. Reading article truly way get entire picture facts. Rarely, ever, article ever refer entire world come conclusion alone headline good idea. 

In general, independent, UK news sites make sort reference country referring (whether country, county, city, government individual) referring UK, general titles give reference like mostly UK related (and usually England specifically). 

This tip useful (most times) headline readers - generally bad idea likely going pile misinformation head that's always anyways. *Yeah, trust science science says things want hear.* Wow, incredibly insightful article here. feel like messaging bad. 

The message ""do right things get vaccine turn normal summer done this""

That would inspire hope reinforce vaccine way whole things. want Fair points let's see happens. think clear cut either way minute (e.g. may right). feel much mindless unbridled optimism view minute amongst large section public unless viewed context sides could dangerous outcomes. E.g. woods yet (no matter much hope are). think get think significant minority don't. Wow surprising hear. good way. Yeah maybe best metaphor use, im flashbacks last summer numbers deaths anyone claimed would another wave got voted, finished summer 2020 everyone claiming winter gonna bad called fear mongerer. Hell still remember posting videos Wuhan Facebook back February 2020 people call fear monger, guy straight lost mom covid weeks ago even commented one posts saying would never leave China, gets states like ebola three four people get it. doctors saying asymptomatic spread thing lag time infection symptoms seemed like common sense things going get bad. felt numbers low summer feel watching doctor john campbell YouTube reporting fast variants doubling compared initial wave. swaying opinions sub studied psychologist cuz absolutely insane. I'm glad friends everyone know taking seriously continue taking seriously including getting vaccinated everything return normal instead insisting virus breach rights choosing put head sand. best bit I've seen older people tell friends ""you can't live fear!"" like none us scared truly, im even scared, shame live thru honestly chance (were young twenties) death basically nhil, take procautions bracket safety.

At point im rambling guess I'm trying say thing truly scares behavior people denial. feel though cases go back people going start acting extremist violent thus making things even worse. matters though, comment get voted, echo chamber scream echo chamber wants, continue pandemic (which want) another wave everyone get weird hunker fear mongering fake news. one ~66%, i.e. 3 times. 

Source that? Yes, lower, afaik quite dramatic: 76% one dose 82% second dose.   Please get shit peer reviewed get high respectable doctors confirm start plan let mask restrictions unreliable source? bad. Apologize.  False. [U.S. send $2 billion global Covid vaccine program targeting developing fault. Need read carefully. cases canada they'll vaccinate caregivers eldery assisted living, surrogate frontline workers. know someone got vaccination standby method. Excuse somewhat late response.

I looked read couple articles studies, situation Manaus definitely something keep close look slightly worrying.

The amount people antibodies probably severely overestimated though. blood samples spring, 44% showed antibodies iirc (read couple days ago). increased maximum 75%. unlikely that's correct estimate. Still, 44% nothing. way kinds trials tests communicated public also influence total number. advertise study discover whether people antibodies Covid, people suspicion antibodies system participate vice versa. I'm entirely sure went down. 

Actual confirmed cases reinfection well documented, still rare, steady increase active cases short period time worrying definitely needs investigation. now, natural infection previous strains proven provide immunity new strains, looks exception. true, could potentially dangerous.

I missed news, thank making aware it. Sorry article Spanish.

It seems cholesterol plays role Covid. 

In case specific patient suffered bilateral pneumonia due covid cholesterol levels reduced half.

No medical explanation found yet. really weird way look world. 

Your worldview incorporate things proven exist, else worldview completely made whims things personally think possible. 

It‚Äôs... problem. believing allows sleep soundly night, go ahead. 

Have great Sunday. Antibodies memory too. someone said earlier, antibodies wane mean immune. contrary, robust secondary antibody response ramps within days ever encounter virus (or vaccine) again. Probably safe. way there‚Äôs fire outside, won‚Äôt able get in. lethality infected = deaths. mean previous agreement nullified sorry. handed over. actually specified contract EU signed thanks negotiations made EU members earlier Hey guys, know post this, figured knowledge share help out. little background: work engineer setting systems/equipment life science healthcare companies. traveling since May 2020 since work considered essential. flew 55 flights 2020 15 far year. usually wear N95 mask them. 25.

Next morning (Thursday met up, spoke distance said feeling really run down. returned home Friday (yesterday). got tested immediately returning home positive covid. Please help advice, setting critical systems mass covid vaccination sites.

I isolating room. received 1 dose moderna vaccine 2/13. Thursday 2/18 5 days exposure. 

&amp;#x200B;

* chances asymptomatic?
* get covid tested, kind? supervisor wants get tested right away, I've read tests wildly inaccurate days exposure.
* get tested tomorrow, (3 days exposure) maybe Tuesday? so? even think thats case would obly shift blame one country another Good them. Astrazeneca vaccine good. Europe people want use it. $1400 (+$600) seems pretty well set stone even conservative Dem Senators agreeing it.

It's expected bill passed 3/14, unemployment benefits run out. Yeah, got mocked first 4 months Managers general public. cares? Grade School...

The new plans mean 15 April, adults aged 50 over, well younger people underlying health conditions put higher risk, offered jab. Good thing compete completely lock wear mask I'm thinking old folks getting first. 5 years studies going come back headlines something like 25% percent people got vaccine within 5 years! read study realize like 50% subjects 80. Okay, say anything wether someone vaccinated transmit virus? 

A good percentage people receive vaccine still go either symptomatic aysmptomatic infection. people still transmit virus? know.  Thats I'm saying. best vaccine

How mean? AZ highest efficacy preventing deaths serious disease, surely metric matters context. even read post constantly shocked subreddit surprised things like 

The article admitted hospital severe infection, significant portion requiring mechanical ventilation. It‚Äôs absurd think someone many required mechanical ventilation induced coma weeks a-okay get suffer complications. Even need supplemental oxygen you‚Äôre still quite sick

It‚Äôs like getting serious car accident puts coma month expecting you‚Äôll 100% back normal get hospital

You‚Äôll dead within 100 150 years sure. I've seen before, really understand vaccinate cancer. instructions getting cells? cells producing afterwards fight cancer? intuition reasonable vaccines prevent bad disease.

Example: get memory cells vaccine body doesn‚Äôt activate days infection starts multiply. meantime Covid could give sniffles incubate throat turns still able transmit virus. 

Early data AstraZeneca suggests vaccine like 90 percent preventing hospitalization like 20 percent reducing asymptomatic PCR positive swabs. mRNA vaccines good might like 95 percent hospitalization 80 percent swabs. contrarian asshole really want live life? Edit. peoples downvoting guy caught Covid months ago dealing negative effects months later. I've hospital times past 8 months previous 30 years life. it? how? lmaooooooo pint pint - seems fair me. That‚Äôs true common respiratory viruses too.

Whether highly successful beyond number shots given, remains seen. able tell make comparisons countries avoided AZ.  Second paragraph. That. im hoping someone clear me, vaccinated population, shots, 4.2% still show symptoms get infected? lets say, vaccine 95.8% effective 100 people vaccinated, 100 people, shouldnt 4 people got infected shown mild symptoms? They're benefit unvaccinated workers crossing Israel. saying Yeah, used generation proxy age, find source broke difference continuous function age. Fewer. ... Oh nothing. :( sorry hear mate anybody see Zuckerberg leak last summer told executives cautious RNA basically modifying DNA? Someone needs ban guy. Ok. Texas California. mask mandates.

We already enough doses bit two secured reach herd immunity within months FDA rush approve something questions asked Yet vaccine mainly used vaccine highly successful vaccination program UK. country course decline vaccine, means wait months alternatives produced. AZ accounts big chunk planned vaccine deliveries EU following months, really choice highly efficient vaccine vaccine all. article says nothing making new model. appear selling exact one pandemic. problem hospitals refuse fit tests required purchasing new manufacturer. 

The current shortage exists hospital admins want exist. quite literally putting money health safety employees patients. Interesting can‚Äôt read title? article? schools entirely closed year probably stay closed next. country raising generation lobotomites they're making sure children little stimulation possible shut up. 

Would say bullshit unvaccinated 70 year old wants feel protected?? guns pointless. work. Several different makes models. never ever gotten reading higher 97. run bit hot well, usually around 99. reminder: Correlation equal causation know ramping up, feels super low, mean, PA, state 1/3 population little 2x vaccinations 1 day. Fauci chortle hairy nutsack Also one thing note Israel giving everyone two vaccines 3 week interval. Although they‚Äôve given 80 doses per 100 people, translates roughly 40% population due 2 dose method. 

The U.K. hand given 27 doses per 100 people given almost doses first vaccine many people possible, opting give second shot 12 weeks after. Science shown first vaccine wholly prevents deaths hospitalisation even it‚Äôs bit less effective protecting people Covid, ease pressure hospitals people might still get covid 1st vaccine, won‚Äôt get really sick it. 

Anyway looking data you‚Äôd think Israel‚Äôs number much better place UKs due different strategies they‚Äôre not. Oh wanting protected selfish?

Would say unvaccinated 70 year old? No, it‚Äôs dude... elderly people dying aren‚Äôt part economic future first places long-haulers, matter see news, long-haulers, especially younger generations, rare people don‚Äôt even experience symptoms anything mild case.

Vaccine kills Covid19 viruses 95% efficacy, great success. Well tad early hard data though reports A. Africa France show occuring tidbit WHO.  I've read recently, preliminary data suggests immunity heads health organizations ready say that's case yet. 

Farthest willing go right say least prevents symptoms/serious cases. Given west got place value system India going call OG number system. must read study response. 30-40k participants. Actual efficacy based 170 actual infected. enlist many people make sure enough people actually got infected hospitalized measure first primary objective analysis **based 170 cases COVID-19**, specified study protocol, 162 cases COVID-19 observed placebo group versus 8 cases BNT162b2 group. Efficacy consistent across age, gender, race ethnicity demographics. observed efficacy adults 65 years age 94%.

8/170 ~ 95%. ......and school districts last day school end May. never fan concept using masks give people low doses virus immunity fan CIDRAP article.


I always bigger fan masks distancing vaccine came replacing distancing vaccine keeping masks (anyone thinks social distancing sustainable crazy, look people incapable distancing deny seriousness virus avoid cognitive dissonance).

It would funny end ""variolation"" phenomenon actually knocked pandemic faster vaccine does. Like never thought would, think would mean won't. it. Complete normalcy horizon. Trouble adjusting new technology limited learning awhile willfully placing faculty danger killing them, yah that's tough call.  Yeah, really stupid. Sweden low mask usage, otherwise extreme. imagine person says, ""No thanks, I'm good,"" MMR jab behalf child. we‚Äôre roughly 30-38% immunity. Damn. well aware science. spent time pandemic reading r/covid, instead afraid shadow. also sit anticipation every word Fauci says. likely change mind next week anyway. Meanwhile Canada haven‚Äôt even gotten first shot yet despite working COVID ward large hospital hope future. Yesterday Bloomberg, NY rates bit higher today. Nothing added, preferred old way.

Don‚Äôt tell Brits. No.  changed qualifications, simply zero reading comprehension. 

My argument never authoritarian regimes simply fail fund forms scientific research education.

Again, beginning. Fundamental Scientific Method free inquiry. deny free inquiry (and mean *deny*, violence) repudiate Scientific Method, definition anti-science.¬†This academic, ignore science progresses. Let's say regime funds rocket science, arrests marine biologists. type sea algae used produce cheap rocket fuel? stifle science violence hinder science. can't even say Nazis pro-rocket science (in particular, Nazis murdered scientists could helped build rockets). scientific advancements authoritarian regimes *in spite* anti-science policies.

Your previous attempt use religion analogy¬†was ham-fisted. point made fixing it. Suppose regime claimed pro-Christianity. However, outlawed belief Jesus one true son God, enforced heavy violence. belief *the* central tenet Christianity. cannot Christian violently deny divinity Christ. regime simply fail pro-Christianity, anti-Christianity. also explains per day vaccination rate plummeted. always day ""ahead"". quotes think Bloombergs numbers always representive current. government that, faults, least willing take risks. That's inherent factor immunization. Even literally let virus roll course infect everyone world, would eventually reach point would high selection pressure find way infect people already infected. believe Neher trying fan flames fear, correct words absolutely used somewhat misleading way.

You cannot reduce number infections without either indefinite complete lockdown means increase selection number. Outside North Korea maybe China, complete lockdowns never real option, yeah, risk increasing selection pressure route every developed country decided take. mean prevent transmission well? wild organization even exists. Ultimate MLM. Uhhhhh yes

Am supposed run away grandmother tries give hug? Serious question. need plicebo group determine efficacy variants? didn't. Phase 3 used 30-40k. Half Europe going take ""vacation"" UK July even know long mrna vaccines development for? Soon bb soon. right. started feel might case government recently bought another 10 million doses Pfizer - despite already ample supply manufacturing capability AstraZeneca.

I think super lucky regards pandemic compared countries, I'm glad waited little begin rollouts.

I know many people get flu shot year, they're usually fine, occasional sore arm day something. Every one know AstraZeneca UK experienced bad side effects needed time work it. know vaccine would rather have. they're Jews. Nothing that.
 see Jerusalem important Islam, believe Jews control it. two state solution offered. Multiple times. arabs walked away deal. want one Islamic country middle east. want zero Jewish ones there. First - untrue. Also - mean people also club? Pretty sure manage themselves. This. couldn‚Äôt source usual masks, admin fit tested us different ones. got fit tested 3 times since covid. annoying, 100% worth protected. hospital isn‚Äôt willing protect employees, they‚Äôre problem. Congestion runny nose literally list linked.

I think person covid, ridiculous think impossible. know lot people, covid mild disease, could present similarly cold.

This anecdotal, friend mine got tested one co-workers tested positive. Test came back positive day started feeling symptoms. runny nose headache. think might need read again... Saving idea later.

We need start utilizing testing capacity flu.

Characterizing genetics currently circulating flu would help us generate better vaccines. places cases lately. Since travel currently really low (but explode soon) getting rid flu something would able now. Context? hard ""just live life"" many things still banned. 

I go walk outside shop mall right now, that's makes life worth living. can't volunteer meet people events, visit friends live overseas, even sit library read without government lifting restrictions. part ""vaccinated"" get? need Fauci tell less riskier hug them.

Whatever Fauci says, see Easter give hug... something done since January 2020. show symptoms, won‚Äôt Except that‚Äôs true. Please research wow. Holy shit. chapped lips winter even thought obviously mask. currently 28 million confirmed cases, let‚Äôs super generous say antibodies robust enough fight virus.

This super generous. even mildly generous. exact opposite things. minimum floor, plausibly low.

The numbers infected, vast majority significant immunity (not antibodies), definitely vastly higher 28 million. ‚ÄúWill need vaccinated Covid-19 every year future like influenza?

At moment, doesn‚Äôt look like vaccine protection Sars-CoV-2 wearing quickly influenza. However, could imagine vaccination refreshed every years adapted vaccine common virus variants.‚Äù

Informative read little silver lining there. honest answer weakness. people crow loudest land free, home brave, America first, look-how-strong-I-am-because-I-never-say-sorry, people wilted like rancid butter sun notion of...wearing cloth mouths noses. entitled, weak people acting however believe they're entitled act, minds rugged individualists special insights even expert epidemiologists possess. really baffling decision part company I‚Äôd interested know logic went (production costs speed maybe?). I‚Äôd heard 3M apparently also pulled production one common models company, others field, fit-test personnel for, one that‚Äôs apparently well-suited people smaller faces, without indication why. 

On topic fit testing, it‚Äôs also bit strange hear company president refer fit testing ‚Äú15 minute procedure‚Äù, leave potential far longer (my took nearly hour), done trained professional (we grand total 2 staff though we‚Äôre much smaller 5k employees), often comes associated medical clearance requirements. definitely see suddenly re-test thousands employees nearly time could throw operations chaos. Whose ever idea make deal Israel needs promoted fucking hard. brilliant move. CDCs data might good start guidelines say stadiums, large entertainment venues, nightclubs bars allowed open there‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine. Despite two, there‚Äôs indication Massachusetts moving Phase 4 anytime soon.

I think big takeaway. Charlie Baker made clear details would vaccine here. vaccine's two months, million people state gotten it. I'm saying time lift restrictions, well past time tell us restrictions lifted.

I think would make much sense set date, need accountable metric. average case number, percentage population vaccinated, number occupied hospital beds, something track estimate going over, right clarity there, every reporter state absolutely *grilling* Governor Baker gives us clarity. problem is: we‚Äôre talking extremists views. We‚Äôre talking governmental media messaging. It‚Äôd one thing dealing wingnuts whichever side political spectrum ‚Äî it‚Äôd easier ignore psychologically affect us negative manner. But, it‚Äôs barrage ‚Äúno normalcy even vaccination‚Äù government legacy media, isn‚Äôt easily ignored. 

Note: I‚Äôm saying sort governmental media conspiracy. It‚Äôs modus operandi ‚Äî it‚Äôs default method dealing things. me, that‚Äôs scarier situation sort conspiracy ‚Äî conspiracies least chance unraveled discredited. Source? Apparently Reddit way different real life. dont know anyone seen family point year. I've seen hugged laws, parents sister.

Scientific advice whether something safe isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpermission‚Äù. It‚Äôs making sure you‚Äôre fully informed dumbass decisions might make. half dose full dose? [90% effective first needs symbolic, cheap, aimed directly would otherwise get vaccinated.

I think $1 tax credit would work. could cost like 200 million.

I think ad campaign, done correctly, could work.

I think politicizing vaccine brands (one liberal one conservative) could eventually utilized.

I think sort new cultural funeral ritual lost covid may effective. NYT seems incredibly slow compared others. one way look appreciate that. shouldn‚Äôt bee way either. That‚Äôs okay. district done safety measures though basically district around us open. side communities trust belief district distorted. cautious served (aka given 30 minutes appointments) 3000 100k students. 4000 left district shit ton made plans leave school isn‚Äôt open full time fall. going mass layoff school staff schools going decrease quality due people leaving. district hasn‚Äôt surveyed provided opportunity talk parents once. We‚Äôre completely cut picture. teacher union, board board worried union us. parents completely demoralized even open don‚Äôt know able trust child put low priory list. 

My point is, pandemic sucks everyone. parents waiting year, safety measures place. It‚Äôs time open. It‚Äôs right thing do. Ya, seen mom since January 2020 either. got first dose vaccine. can't wait hug understanding, Pfizer trying everything possible get safe, effective vaccine market fast possible. succeeded this, took extra precautions 100% vaccine would remain stable. afford mistakes.

Now, months later, done examination product determined safe leave lower temperature time. could done testing vaccine released market, would slowed down.

Preventing infection requires neutralizing antibodies- bind kill virus chance take hold body. Even high enough titer right 'flavors' neutralizing antibodies prevent infection first place, chances regular antibodies cells help prevent disease. 

One way definitively say vaccine prevents transmission expose vaccinees virus- ethical considerations so, didn't. Instead study authors looking develop ""correlates protection""- ie, saying develop x level flavor neutralizing antibodies z period time, likely protected infection first place. Moderna study authors specifically said determine correlates protection YET many cases vaccine group. big statement make, many implications, they're cautious. 

The encouraging thing earlier studies, vaccinated chimpanzees develop neutralizing antibodies protected viral challenge.

Sorry clear. would people vaccine available want it.

if still significant virus circulation, still significant number people dying, vaccinated people little risk unvaccinated people high risk. deny activities vaccinated idiots want get vaccinated.

I'm claiming there's risks, deaths, etc. demographic trying diminish it, reality bulk issues COVID come older various co-morbidities.

But got large chunk adult population vaccinated, going flat see obliteration hospitalization/death count COVID. Even little Timmy gets it, he's super spreading vector that's going wreck vaccinated older family. They'll almost surely fine, even one vaccinated still gets it, vaccines turn COVID mild annoyance.

We live deal flu deaths every year, turn COVID flu level less style illness, see excuse cower corner COVID. Unless we're adopting ""zero deaths illness"" goal society. literally impossible.

One last note vaccines kids coming tested fall believe. Cars: 35,000
COVID: 500,000 

In way equal risk? Let guess - ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu!‚Äù experts claim [vaccine end statements inaccurate. Please research make claims. repeat said. ""listen [the take vaccine actually end shit.

This say happen, likely worst case scenario outside crazy mutation evading vaccines, Fauci said possible. Sorry puts outside comfort zone. health guidance says so. I'd say coming soon, one last things lifted. Man almost like desire media interview disease specialist coincides diseases news!

I can't wait stop giving uncles doctor much attention dies cancer. Sick seeing guys smug face!! vaccine worthless significant majority population. True, true. pointing skewed logic.

My parents teachers (not elementary though) understanding issues. country children usually start school age 7. attend pre-school 1-2 year prior. kindergarten couple years. Pre-school kindergarten completely skipped.

We're averaging new zoonotic disease every 3-4 years, quadrupling rate since 1970. Clearly, continue track see happens. Justin's Canada.

Anyone could see coming kilometre away. Pfizer long list plants US. two mRNA vaccines, although similar differently results.

Probably due different dosages, Moderna vaccine higher 1st dose efficacy, Pfizer‚Äôs. known since original studies.

A study vaccines mixed doesn‚Äôt really serve significant purpose.

Then, tried argue efficacy transmission would never occur second dose. demonstrated happen.  actually peak flu season. regulars, I've busy work less active lately ever need chat feel free message. I'm always glad talk can. hoarding vaccines wealthy nations ultimately prolong pandemic giving virus selective pressure time mutate non-vaccinated countries. USA, China, Russia, others want *actually* stop pandemic tracks, make vaccines open source. Yeah sarcastic virus started spreading Germany Nov last year.

Did check numbers that? Mid February Germany 16 case, month later 5,700 cases month 134,000. That's spreading, that's exponential growth.

I seen studies link obesity infection rates. associated greater symptoms already affected.

Could explain mean ""talking waves""?

The idea horrible infection rates western countries function transparency seem basis fact. First many countries list generally recognized democracies. Second credible evidence eastern countries underreporting compared western countries significant way.

By saying Germany better everyone else article tries make point possible control infectious diseases without sorts lockdowns many eastern countries implemented. evidence clearly shows case.

This article correct stating Germany's model currently containing virus. dead wrong claims previously did. No, not. money handout same. modified version regular EI. thing is, everyone wears mask know need lockdowns. several asian nations withstand covid w/o lockdowns everyone work medical face mask? Yes. half country refuses open own. one way that's herd immunity. People either choose take easy way take shot risk get sick.

After shot widely available sympathy anyone catching refused vaccine zero. may right. test though? test for? vaccinated individuals infected coronavirus purposely controlled amount follow later measure?

The actual report behind paywall, can't really read it. article made sound like laboratory testing transmission lab results testing wild. Maybe misunderstand (which likely). Asian accept wait vaccinated

The vaccine kind magical solution 

Keep mind people still wearing masks vaccination daily thread becoming cesspool covid idiots. :/ See: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. vaccines matter ignoring them. older children want vaccine ? younger children parents want vaccinate?

Even risk low, argument apply too, don‚Äôt opportunity get want likely won‚Äôt 2022 looks it, teenager well. Lol previous century. I'm talking life 21st century, Justin's Canada. We‚Äôve seen terrible public messaging almost every turn. Like it‚Äôs unbelievable bad they‚Äôve been, whole way through.

I don‚Äôt know problem is. Letting scientists briefings talk directly journalists? tendency say ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt/isn‚Äôt ‚Äù instead ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know yet, based current data historical evidence, probably...‚Äù masking, covid airborne, vaccines blocking transmission.

Those three, especially first two cost hundreds thousands lives. rAcIsT black people getting vaccine want vaccine I'm confused, doubtful... giving flashbacks last January's denialism [when Los Alamos already calculated R0 super high even Trump stepping numbers. Could 20% more, knows? nope, give many many rights agree living campus housing. prosribed tenant rights agree live university dorms/apartments. restrict access &amp; guests. impose curfews. enter time. Even normal search &amp; seizure rules work differently campus housing. good luck hoping served 30-day notice: campus police haul ass out. educated person's weasel words. Hedge upon hedge. editor would allow remain written statement. vaccination effort fragmented US. You‚Äôll need localities federal government page never happen. would mess UK going longer interval doses. get vaccine UK get appointment time 2nd dose 3 months later. Here's whole quote...wow, asshole. /s
""When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent ... Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ""I nudge bit,"" went 80, 85. need humility .... really don‚Äôt know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I'm going say 90 percent."" Damn, plus ~50 million people already least one covid shot. There's overlap obviously would mean ~140 people basically immune point. remember work AIDS?  Yes, America First unacceptable understandable national policy. We're nearly 4% vaccination rate populous areas closer 50% first responders vaccinated, okay, especially big shipment vaccine Europe arrives later month. We've also highly prioritized indigenous communities North vaccination rates well 20% right now.

Thank expression sympathy. (US) still deserve crap it. people liken vaccine lines holokaust lines. Seriously.

But, luckily large number people either emotionally compromised safety, least willing go along vaccination get things openned up.

Poor central coordination made seriously uneven rollout, enough different procedures happenned areas extremely effective. county rolled clinic vaxxes 1000 per hour, scaled 4-fold enough volunteers found. (It takes 600 workers rate 10 hours).

So, county nearby counties openned clinics state resident meets phase criteria. leftover doses need get used, fire departments, pharmacies, chruches, etc. jump action get people queued up.

Some equitable distribution OP Article references real concern, higher numbers people vaccinated sooner much better overall life-saving perfect queue takes twice long (or more). pointing out. assumed US first read U.K. given compared state country, thought might believed national ‚Äúaverage‚Äù. wouldn‚Äôt go far assume people wipe groceries reheat food mental illness. feel confident risk exposure? wiping groceries helped someone sleep night, what‚Äôs harm? Obviously it‚Äôs unnecessary, though. thread become lighthouse morons come crazy ocean. guess lockdown skeptic right wing subs boring now. Pfizer's vaccine may technically superior, nothing added logistics requires support massive rollouts. racist aunt saying since forever. saying ptsd depression. seen doctors unable to.diagnose say depression , panic attack.etc. went true mental health professional may fit true guidelines. Like am.down energy. Well.we.cant find physical so.must mental. true physical cause found it. fact reduces transmissions known ...who said needed one outdoors? condition. Maybe tried get Rona. Thank do. glad guys getting relief deserved past 11+ months. thoughts new variants? getting shot 2 weeks. hug family month, care Fauci says point. Bad behavior: Spreading deadly disease like crazy, developing vaccines. 

Worse behavior: Spreading deadly disease like crazy arsed develop vaccine, aka Justin's Canada. Ah old liberal agenda, blame everything someone them....

We vaccines... Trudeaus fault 100%. obvious failed secure source. Yes produce them, every country does. Could imagine trump failed roll vaccines? I‚Äôve trying figure that‚Äôs causing that.

One theory (no idea there's evidence it) virus already infected people take precautions, people left taking precautions. 

So 1/3 country ignored virus, it. 2/3 sheltering place, using masks, social distancing, etc. harder virus infect people. Unless you‚Äôre ADHD ass pulls eyebrows eyelashes compulsively ... Womp womp he's kind public figure gets fifteen minutes fame ever decade heads back lab like nothing special happened.

You find video ebola outbreak gowned went rooms last March one knew name /face.

If stays job next decade he'll anonymous yet US come better majority countries sub praised. always does. comparing two totally different types vaccines. point? RNA ones extremely similar Israel largely using pfizer no? quite different AZ. data linked literally showed increase effectiveness 83% 36 days. valid criticism I'm ears. see dropping concerning levels extra 24 days. seen convincing arguments towards notion One 10x other. wears on, on, agree you.  agree could returned early unfortunately thats case everyone. Im US work visa contract job break substantial financial penalties. dont agree arbitrary $2k cost quarantine. negative covid test/proof vaccination enough return opinion. governments initial response bad hit hard. still getting hit hard.

We also 360 million people worry about. ""You're kid worried"" comment. honest I'm frustrated terrified online children/teenagers. really think we've failed let kids know fine pandemic really issue elderly/people comorbities. terrifying children Pollution? Strict regulations? Nope, carbon capture.

There's plenty strict regulation pollution US. Clean Air Act Clean Water Act notable examples.  benefit/cost ratio CAA calculated around 40. even GQP talks getting rid it.

There's also innovation regulation. Sulfur emissions, example, subject cap-and-trade style control scheme ended costing 1/6th predicted cost per unit avoided SO2 emission.  Sulfur emissions US low farmers areas add sulfate fertilizer get corn grow properly (this mean controls bad, indication much sulfate deposition reduced.)  vaguely recall, done cooperation Canada, also sulfur emission issues, particularly Sudbury. Canada *should* expect US assist them. Canada one best allies dependable friends, well as, neighbors. get vulnerable population vaccinated, assist Canadians. affects neighbors affects us well, economically politically.  Canada one largest trading partners assisted US past, least forget actions 9/11 helped potentially preserve American lives hospitality showed. next time US needs assistance maybe Canadians remember refusal assist them. Also one reason US able project it‚Äôs power globally US good relations it‚Äôs immediate neighbors aren‚Äôt bogged guarding borders. I‚Äôve lived abroad past 5 years first time wish back States...good guys  European, fully vaccinated happy. Working health-care perks...for mask. lockdown. stay-at-home order. We're flattening curve, thought together forever? Damn man, go get covid test, isolate get results, go see them. No. however effective treatments available invermectin (have look obviously consult professional) help them. But, need vaccine recover (I hope wish best) effective immunity infection, thought worth mentioning. Vaccines preventative method. balance, think US done better fronts Canada. 

What crazy ass thing say. 
They've fighting close year sort payment help covid, Canada CERB almost day 1. 
The amount contagion deaths also even remotely close shitshow south. 
Like... incredibly privileged see impacts help provided government? Kids flu shots. far I'm concerned, parental neglect killed them. see mean. low risk transmission walking people sidewalk. higher risk associated lingering vicinity infected person longer time indoor, poorly-ventilated spaces without wearing masks. kiss parents. reverse true parents. take seriously they're out, could get give you. might feel weird wearing mask inside home helpful. prioritize going walk least day get sunlight. Staying inside make go nuts I'm sure know. fine able maintain two-meter distance people. live big city go friends houses cars seen friends albeit one time I've maintained physical distance. crazy cyclist cough face (I self-isolated two wks after) gob spit left front door. always take stairs leave apt. building. never got covid symptoms neither mom, knock wood. yes yell touches food washing hands. always ask washed hands comes in. Science says eating red meat leads heart disease, politics government taxes bans red meat. Science says wear masks, politics calls mandates violation fines... becomes political  Yeah, vaccines developed government funding provided free public everything inequities capitalism. get Fauci trying cautious promise anything bad messaging. bad nation‚Äôs morale bad vaccine effort. many people hear similar statements think ‚Äúwhy bother getting vaccine doesn‚Äôt result lifted restrictions still get sick, etc?‚Äù yep situation JNJ neither needed frankly really wanted doses available soon enough really move needle Always makes wonder kind person thinks name like acceptable, good idea well. It‚Äôs ‚Äúpunished‚Äù. It‚Äôs civic duty little longer. faster eradicate spread, benefits us return back normal. office room everyone vaccinated, longer require it. Outside public, it‚Äôs really inconvenient wear mask Thank correction. ""Usually"" sufficient replacement ""Never""

It's mask. things relaxed? SURE. still significant percentage population vaccine *and wants it*... tolerant simplified, long-term precautions. mask seems like simple, free, already in-place solution. Relax bit... sure. chime in, I'm hospitalist physician community hospital Ontario taking care active covid patients got vaccine one hospital gotten one except brief period January due receiving vaccine last getting cut first shortages started.

Communities outside big cities getting hosed. stomach issues nausea/vomiting reported Moderna side...

exactly i'm experiencing first second moderna shots counting Canadians getting vaccinated Florida no?  Sure relied vaccines, refused opportunities purchase vaccines, actively campaigned funding states vaccinate people, couldn‚Äôt even bothered keep tabs doses ensure shipped arrived, leaving 20 million doses unaccounted Biden admin trying find. Hard say good job look details. Many front line colleagues not. 

I'm lowly volly firefighter NJ I've gotten shots. situation unacceptable every way. left wants ban ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù. It‚Äôs far fetched believe freedom speech right wing view now. comment quite correct interpret clinical trial data. [moderna clinical trial looking table 2 efficacy calculation, methods determine who's ""case"". Note following everyone pcr tests every couple days extent trial. also regularly collecting blood antibody detection everyone. looking self-reported covid symptoms first, subset trial participants got covid test. ""case"" needed 1) exhibit symptoms, 2) test positive.

Now looking positive cases two groups (19,965 got vaccine, 20,172 got placebo) 9 cases vaccine group 169 cases placebo group. report 94.6% efficacy, comes 1-(9/169). 

There's kinda complicated discussion long followed patients since trial participants vaccinated day, vaccine/placebo designation evenly split entire vaccination time trial, usually wait write report enough people gotten sick either 1) statistical power say vaccine works, 2) statistical power say vaccine effect. values/thresholds decided start trial.  like suggestion I've seen others, mrna vaccines older immunocompromised/at risk individuals, johnson &amp; johnson younger healthier individuals. 0 deaths j&amp;j extreme reduction severe cases seems like enough greatly supplement general population vaccine plan. Fair enough man. thought Biden said Pfizer plants US export vaccine? know separate entity, seems like government's decision. Regardless, thanks explanation. Hope I'm able travel soon. many places United States bucket list. ever north 49th, I'll buy ya pint. 

Cheers!  everyone planet doesn‚Äôt get vaccinated, isn‚Äôt waste considering mutations? headline shyte. First sentence: Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday ""**possible**"" Americans still need wear masks 2022 protect coronavirus, **even US may reach ""a significant degree normality"" end year.** biggest thing whole pandemic everything goes back normal tons tons people never learned anything it. basically problem germany. I'm fucking sick bullshit. Even what's best child endangering lives, life others lives sake slightly easier education awhile lol? Actually like always going infectious diseases spread, including flu. want absolutely certain aren‚Äôt spreading anything hide basement rest life.

The rest us gathering. good point... üò¨

But $$$ talks, no? world doesnt care; want sweet Chinese consumer cash!

And still, regardless actual virus numbers there, u cannot deny less deaths. Im sure u would hide millions deaths Corona... Im somewhat convinced contained virus much better USA. criticisms aside, goal USA LAST place, imo. world leader secure dosages wherever use manufacturers one messes up. one mistake pfizer breaks rollout suck good contingency plan 

Some incredibly misinformed... like holy shit... 
We 70m+ vaccines order 7 different vaccine manufacturers. 
Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, Janssen, GSK, AstraZenaca Medicago. 
We getting fucked rich countries swooping billions getting priority. 
It fuck Trudeau. Silver lining finally supply US done them. isolation statement perfectly reasonable. casual follow referencing 2022 masking problem. stick first comment consistent isnt room changing narrative reaction.

The fact year long pattern ridiculously bad lead communicator US governments position current science.

He knows every word scrutinized. knows people take says literally. messaging allow accusations changing goal posts unless provides valid, well done source change. I‚Äôve heard doctors CNN say (Fauci, Sanjay Gupta). Even federal government pushing idea too. answer 150 total. kids die flu, cancer, accidents. I‚Äôm masking that. might well stay indoors forever logic Oh know. always controversy. I've read many articles too, nothing conclusive symptoms less severe.

I one kid that's become bit overweight, turned 13 6'1"" tall eats like tomorrow, know he'll likely lose weight want susceptible complications he's bit heavy moment (I way kid slimmed later). mention maybe underlying condition know about, like heart defect may cause problems otherwise? guess parent always worry. Best medicine terrible public health. Unfortunately AZ less agile compared mRNA. 

Can‚Äôt really see used past 2021  Likely fine US since people vaccinated. There‚Äôs long time could always reduce guest list late summer things don‚Äôt look great reason. None trials looked that. Absolutely! would reason hold Autumn even summer since everyone risk vaccinated many others option offered too. would suggest change strategy could whole thing again, regarding unified response personal responsibility? People love dismiss realists ‚Äúpessimists‚Äù reality isn‚Äôt looking good. 

At beginning last year, told many times ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù say USA could looking hundreds thousands deaths didn‚Äôt get shit together quickly.

At time, seemed unthinkable, people dismissed fear mongering.

I said along would first celebrate things looking up, throughout much 2020, honestly first vaccine news (with exception therapeutics) wasn‚Äôt much reason optimism. response generally unmitigated unnecessary disaster first testing issues lack coordinated national strategy. 

Now people seem surprised tell probably much population vaccinated April may, restaurants bars likely back normal capacity summer. 

It‚Äôs optimism pessimism, it‚Äôs realism based available information. fair, people California alone entire country Canada. exactly good comparison progress. lock flu since it‚Äôs deadly children? Exactly. We‚Äôre starting see data support higher storage temperatures increased time doses. significantly increase speed vaccinate people. It‚Äôs great news. mind winter, soon humidity comes back, thank you. vaccines United States ship Canada.

Canadians made decision make vaccines. That's vaccines. countries world made decision Canadians made, nobody country would vaccines. way, even vaccinated half population would still higher covid rate Canada without vaccines.

Canadians aware still demanding vaccines. I'm currently South Korea, received vaccination, nobody Korea outside American military stationed here, nobody displaying type entitlement mentality Canadians are. I'm less risk catching COVID family New York is, I'm glad they're getting vaccinated will. 

How entitled selfish aware someone else struggling significantly higher rates COVID, still demanding vaccines made vaccines trying get rate down? clarify, Fauci doesn‚Äôt get paid appear shows. network makes major bank re-running/recycling interview clips ads ad nauseum writing weak, clickbait headlines. heard turning people going another county relieved issues. lol, would want negotiate capitalistic psychopaths would gladly throw gutter, amazing foolish are. Username huh USA! USA! USA! GREATEST COUNTRY EARTH! BACK AGAIN! last President brought us vaccine plan, new guy brought us BACK plan, secured enough doses vaccinate everybody, BACK action BETTER EVER! USA! USA! USA! üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ #GCOE Lol man, you‚Äôre getting worked something hasn‚Äôt happened yet, albeit good news, study done lab conditions via enormous sample size public.

Mask wearing sick public transit normalized way covid countries like South Korea, see well handled it? Infectious diseases aren‚Äôt going leave. get too, think striving gather again, understand, people want gather won‚Äôt cost many human lives dunno, what's acceptable number you? Yeah plan kinda plan like normal cancel to. sucks hard worry especially we‚Äôve started purchase things non-refundable. Oh good true scientist share data us Yes. Kids die. covid usually. vaccine turned covid experience like cold, worked. Aw :/ Yea know, extremely slow start rollout sucks. probably ability make vaccine instead relying others. large markets large purchasing power gives ability effectively negotiate big pharma. 

I think that's single important factor hitting rollout. can't roll can't get hands Vaccines (because vaccines could going us going larger markets). Kids unfortunately die. 

This you? many kids 14 died covid US? Aw:/ ask doctor nurse hospital rather Reddit? 

I think question parents vaccinations, would mean transmit Covid them, end hospital dying.  wear mask driving? Fair points. country ability pay premium. doubt that. wish countries best luck moving forward hope Biden admin repair damaged relationship Trump left behind us. know lot murmurings can't trust United States, moving forward. 

I hope sakes get shit together, fast. 

Cheers! r/shitamericanssay Cool Oh ridiculous! People seem understand get vaccine trains immune system protect personally. everyone needs vaccinated protect need it. catch covid, vaccine fights off, business transmission vaccine problem irrelevant. direct source? first I'm hearing this. largely vaccination vulnerable lack thereof Germany. accomplished start take bit risk. still think EU largely done vaccination towards late summer let's say August early September. Canadian, I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôm healthcare worker although promised vaccine even got appointment, ended cancelling TWICE! Even colleagues got first dose waiting second dose, 2 months fact. Dissapointed disorganized country securing enough vaccines rollout. think would helpful western society adopt attitude phsycally ill public wear mask covid common cold. status quo many places better it. Fauci also said it‚Äôs likely safe vaccinated [family members guidelines fully vaccinated people could change talked level cdc. Well escalated quickly. 

I think take time read forum. note American posters shitting US response covid since day 1, rightfully so. Meanwhile see many Canadian posters gleefully take every opportunity remind us wonderful everything is. Let us one small victory. :)

As ""talk shit healthcare free""

If ""free"" mean compensating lack planning extorting cash neighbors' paychecks... sure can't talk shit. kid course... cognizant healthcare US mess. however mean sunshine roses big Tim-Horton's north. extreme probably unnecessary. seem consumed fear Covid, healthy. 

But, means go ahead. I'm Canadian. ridiculous. thought we've handled pandemic fairly well far, rollout vaccines ridiculously slow. going take year vaccinate miniscule population 13mill. outright failure government. I‚Äôm you. see flood people seem intent throwing race finish line sight. Wow, it‚Äôs almost like blocks transmission like every vaccine.

It‚Äôs good thing public health agencies haven‚Äôt spent last months spreading opposite message, discouraging people getting vaccine.

Oh wait, that‚Äôs exactly they‚Äôve doing, they‚Äôre unbelievably terrible messaging.

Seriously, stop letting scientists talk directly journalists. Stop using scientists briefings.

Stop saying covid vaccine whatever doesn‚Äôt something don‚Äôt know yet, reason suspect doesn‚Äôt. one near terrible remains one busiest chain. trouble managing crowd even COVID. Costco easy go one another state. They're deserted! United States recently underwent change management. Thank God privately owned pharmaceutical companies innovate profits huh? Almost like capitalism drives humanity something. Well that's one way make resistant taking vaccine... know what's funny? Six months ago, would gotten ratioed oblivion said thing. 

Damn, times changed sub toxic time ago. Accepting can‚Äôt different denial pretending everything fine. 

One mature acceptance limitations. ‚ÄúThis hard me. feel like can‚Äôt survive changes. try I‚Äôm able do, putting well first.‚Äù

The child playing pretend. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs necessary things, don‚Äôt believe scientists, bunch political crap, won‚Äôt go along it‚Äôs necessary.‚Äù

One forces accept limitations human being, allows blame others want avoiding guilt shame. 

I see lot people latter. Playing pretend first coping mechanism world. takes lot years maturity truly accept limitations. 23andMe claims variants ever found customer less 500, yet claim 5000. obviously fibbing. one asks anything honor system. would way verify I‚Äôm commenting lol. I‚Äôm simply saying wiping groceries isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúeliminating smallest risk‚Äù risk. It‚Äôs year evidence. exactly AztraZeneca study demonstrating benefits longer interval Overall NAAT positivity appropriate assess whether reduction burden infection. showed single standard dose vaccine efficacy NAAT-positive infection, including symptomatic asymptomatic infections, 63¬∑9% day 22 90 first dose, that, second dose, two standard doses schedule efficacy 49¬∑5%.

So much non-starters.... want know favorite poster unrelenting spreading sources, logic level head. work well appreciated. Mexico here. guys getting vaccines? kids, think things:

- risk kid scary

- Humans terrible estimating risk (overestimate small risks like shark attacks, underestimate bigger risk, like pool accidents)

- There's misinformation there

- social pressure (if parents act like jeopardizing kids, that's obstacle) Vaccines don‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre fully reopening even 100% population vaccinated. Well, least states. Yeah, even people go way get vaccinated another country, doubt would significant amount people. don‚Äôt disagree. wasn‚Äôt pointing global inequity root causes based economic variance. Got source that? Read comments. don‚Äôt think assess what? opinion based, infections dropped 95%. Whether got back relevant fact current vaccine kicking ass. new variants emerge back square one new variants probably year now. reason aware places mass testing them. said U.K. variant would predominant strain March. 4 weeks ago. ignoring deaths ‚Äúextra‚Äù top normally have. Imagine suddenly 10 plane crashing day top everything else one year saying ‚Äúit is, achtually, ACHTUALLY heart disease...‚Äù Guess what, every idiot world would behave like idiots, would equal vaccine distribution Pharma would take 10000$ per dosis gender unclear normally fall back masculine pronouns. Blame English language lack gender less pronouns. Still though could worse, least English isn‚Äôt gender driven Romance languages. school used run enrichment classes summer. pay mythological studies athletic classes summer children lag behind social skills result learning isolated environment.

I mean, case COVID? 

Thankfully indoor playground homeschooling friends kids get together. 

My wife straight works ass off, really incredible. (my kids I) lucky her. TON work. Vaccines reduce transmission mean 3/4 vaccines made US US manufacturers workers...not sure wildly selfish take care medicine first. Especially continues rampage country worse anywhere else.

At end day US nations supply rest world, mostly places capacity produce own. safe everyone planet basically needs one. know sure vaccine prevents transmission, extremely likely prevent least minimizes transmission. cautious study results come in. vaccines produce robust immune response would pretty difficult virus survive long person, viral shedding minimal. Theoretically possible maybe, virus survive skin awhile transferred another person, probably pretty unlikely. choice choice 2 different things. would imagine immunocompromised would take steps protect COVID-19. well go public everyone mask year well won‚Äôt like follow rules. don‚Äôt see 12 -18 months now. Ok, two new technologies. Get AstraZeneca vaccine now, ""pandemic"" around. still majorly stops number hospitalizations deaths, that's importnat part. worry better technologies ways deal later moment breathe. think bigger question happens half country refuses shot? reopen anyway let ppl go maskless take chances? effect hospitalizations &amp; ICU capacity? think anyone thought yet. Chicago summer-level terms easing restrictions Covid metrics lot worse summer-level. considerable improvement compared couple months ago restrictions strictest. wish dad/mom whose Reddit username involved analingus. think UK using they're producing right anyway. didn‚Äôt even say wiped groceries, bud lol don‚Äôt judge high risk people things makes families feel safer equivalent Trump style ""many people saying"". world Good lord man get job move want to. rely people things want beholden people. blame coronavirus this. sincerely hope case wanting make promises can‚Äôt keep. he‚Äôs really saying might keep wearing masks even point would be, *his own* estimate, 6+ months everyone wants vaccine get one, wonder point even is. can‚Äôt stop wearing masks half year vaccine widely available, *can* stop? Asians forever...once they're trend setters... foolish think virus politics strictly American issue. Europe became dumpster fire like lot countries aren‚Äôt even recognizing virus all.

Our issues published available rest world. know, take slow vaccine delivery political system mostly works. 22. linking article that‚Äôs irrelevant Canada isn‚Äôt vaccinating much, friend?

Why ignoring fact American hospitals also capacity pandemic, friend?

Also ignoring fact millions Americans every year avoid going hospital fear buried debt DIE, friend???? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Lol said completely agree rolled out.

Everything else afterthought would note vote change is. I'm sorry trigger you. coming end. media clinging point. tools it‚Äôs going get better better quickly. I‚Äôve serious entire time haven‚Äôt even eaten fact nearing time take lives back. I‚Äôm poked I‚Äôm living life again. part 150%  Rich capitalist countries like US China vaccines. Poor countries don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm willing bet paid able others able compete. politician made claim would make guy look better last guy look bad. supposed take gospel? move adult. old you? Stop bitching it. I'm assuming 18 it. cause hospitalizations?

If spread faster logically amount people hospital one time even hospitalization rate stays same. increase chances straining system First time see word vaccinees Mulroney sold vaccine production. updated rules days ago. come Canada, isolate government approved hotel 3 days. costs 2000 dollars 3 days. That's extra 2000 bucks nothing. get tested multiple times, leave arrive. quarantine 2 weeks whoever quarantine can't leave house too. 

All adds nobody able afford come here. dad visited us abroad year medical needs cannot attend Canada rules. angry idiots prolonging quarantine. don‚Äôt see point getting vaccine anymore. It‚Äôs made clear even 100% population vaccinated, would still locked down, masked up, social distanced. point people USA ignoring public health recommendations others. masks included Here's latest case/death charts California, running 7-day 122.12 deaths per 100k. ranks 33rd per capita You‚Äôre (not specifically) cherry picking shit justify need understand basic biology young children (i.e. get sick often young immune systems, always close contact children, conscientious hygiene). ‚ÄúOh yea, kids get less infected spread virus less adults!‚Äù crock shit. There's really embarrassing takes folks clearly even done slightest bit reading Fauci. Public ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù hear heard immunity projections 85-90%
We told people masks weren‚Äôt needed didn‚Äôt want buying taking away health care workers. 

Use preferred search engine. anything America‚Äôs vaccine roll shows perfect harmony capitalism governmental action. government funneling billions private companies able create whole ass vaccine disease didn‚Äôt know existed year before. private companies using capabilities ramp production government logistical support (plus private companies helping vaccinations) able give almost 2 million shots day. borderline miracle Canada

a years ago conservative government. government sold production facilities private companies much anything terms pandemic.

Canada asked every company vaccine contracts produce here. refused financially lucrative invest states.

The contracts Canada originally signed set delivery timeline. current problem unless Canada suddenly receives large number doses, timeline may met, there'd breach contract. 

These delays due states allowing export vaccines, European production facilities highly prioritizing europe despite telling Canada place country another, would instead follow contracts signed.

Tl;dr Canada's conservative government past ruined ability produce vaccines ourselves. combination governmental decisions, Pfizer lying canada prioritization causing fewer vaccines reach us expected. Canadian public mad this. Every country producing vaccines exporting moment. Trudeau could gone back time stopped Mulroney selling domestic vaccine production capability. How's blame that, type blames everything? He's job longer longer alive public figure length. Tell it. goes show many people addicted gloom doom would love see shit drag out. Personally, can't wait place becomes ghost town months. failed rebut. You‚Äôre misunderstanding. It‚Äôs transmission lab setting, it‚Äôs cases confirmed lab. means people real world go get tested. enough people achieved immunity rely people's ability keep germs themselves. achieve herd immunity roughly two third population receive vaccine. remember cuomo said he‚Äôs gonna state commission review data vaccine bc ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust trump admin.‚Äù came good safe FDA said changed bc ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt trust trump admin.‚Äù San francisco outlier. Google Facebook big tech prevalent area WFH. People also liberal likely follow scientific advice.

What mean area locality bad way divide populations. Since person interacts public San Fransisco similar one texas wfh techie San Francisco. Area valuable metric. people least affected deserve more...

Setting aside much funding put everyone's benefit: desire treat medical care first place trophy, medical care. 

Well, shit. acquired logic anti-national healthcare crowd, highest rung society gets best care despite least danger. like us thought! citizenship certificate mail; please allow 4 - 6 weeks delivery. never ever laughed people dying life

That quite terror criminal mind

While student l'universit√© Laval Qu√©bec City Canada met quite wonderful students came USA study French Quebec City Right CEWS. Huge distinction difference. Hahahah. information test still. I'm saying i'm 100% 80%. DETAIL HIGH SATURATION REPORT. tend remember bit info found interesting. Jesus man. Get dick. Well US young people isolating extent countries. Witness Florida Jersey shore summer. previous federal governments hadn‚Äôt dismantled infrastructure making vaccines. 

But forget even said ‚Äúpolitics Corona bad.‚Äù still ways go would classify vulnerable vaccinated. still vaccinating 1a 1b groups. Once, reach 1c group closer I‚Äôm thinking. I‚Äôm 1c group would willing forestall vaccination meant providing vulnerable Canada vaccinations. Absolute numbers like ‚Äú33 times‚Äù also describe full picture. need consider per capita load. Canada little 1/9 population translates getting whelmed far fewer numbers.  get vaccinated US? Canadian friend US medical treatment, falls high risk class got vaccinated already. know varies state state, would hope you‚Äôd access you‚Äôre US work! think everybody trying get date throwing around it‚Äôll three year meant get say nooooo much sooner American wants vaccine one well end 2021. saying still need wear masks point? so, criteria getting rid masks, want mandated forever?

I means conspiracies, afraid politicians worldwide taking advantage virus see easy gain control population. Hopefully wrong though. This, every 1000 doses Pfizer americans get, get 1 much think he's worried there's huge anti-vax/skeptic sentiment general population prevent US reaching quick herd immunity fall. Even police &amp; firefighter departments see 30 40% frontline responders refusing shot. That's worrisome workers who're public-facing higher risk jobs stations frequent outbreaks. Israel also beautiful beaches, great breakfast, tech scene. Brb checking visa requirements... saying mom can't get tested, assumed point it. possible another respiratory illness dad covid, unlikely. 

Sorry dad. Treatment improved lot since started. hope he'll okay. mean, I‚Äôm getting first shot Thursday I‚Äôll continue wear mask public required businesses (there‚Äôs enforceable mandate live). worked retail restaurants long enough want give workers hard time. 

What *won‚Äôt* double masking anymore. currently disposable cloth mask. I‚Äôm switching disposable only. They‚Äôre much lighter work fine considering effective vaccines are. Paywall cannot read wear glasses could three times less likely infected coronavirus , study India suggested. One way virus enter body people touching eyes, nose mouth coming contact it. However, researchers India say people wear glasses rub eyes less therefore less risk contracting Covid-19 . That's total defense patent infringement. reduce damages  Lol nope saying completely agree vaccines currently distributed.

The rest afterthought. think said original comment. Stay home orders started mask mandates. Sorry entire population decide wear masks experts advising them. I‚Äôm sorry, maybe it‚Äôs caps makes even worse, username eclipses everything else thread. sure via lend-lease. tho! Kids still die without flu shot. It‚Äôs failsafe Sometimes best still lose. way goes sometimes. hope stay responsible meantime nobody wants last man die war.  2 weeks second shot go back licking doorknobs beaten 40s heads months kills healthy people lucky enough die, end whole myriad long term side effects.

My best friend weeks would tell latest fucked thing virus media shut it. know longer care Fauci say. point he's milking 15 minutes relevance. pandemic goes away he. Japan much less covid air. Canada much restricted needs vaccinate faster quick look harms masks children. agree important done away ASAP. Good idea. way easily equal vaccination less 1% entire global population waste exorbitant amounts distribution costs send 1 vial every single village world. Fucking brilliant. Time constraints. said months ago tests agenda. approval get *that* done ASAP. We're heading spring, many risk people vaccinated. personally think restrictions lifted beginning spring. think substantially missing nuance building facilities producing vaccines trivia. expect Canada could that? Depending countries vaccines worked fine pre COVID. Obviously everyone wants vaccine around world falls apart, investing everyone learned countries need fend situation like this. complaining didn‚Äôt accomplish year far we‚Äôve dealing seems ridiculous me. It‚Äôs shit luck, would known? adult Americans. parent teenager pre-teen, eagerly await vaccine options them. Perfect example near-impossible yellow tier ""normal"".

*Wayyyyyy* many think ""once yellow, everything normal!""

There normal tier. Thanks lot. cruel. think necessity/humanitarian point view, USA needs it. selfish POV: 

Canada goes strict protocol, (mostly) right thing year continues lock down: vaccines delayed, MAYBE population 34m vaccinated spring / summer 

USA largely ignores protocol large number states, let's virus run absolutely rampant, people dying place mainly due horrendous healthcare, disenfranchised citizens utterly monstrous amounts misinformation/free speech bashing: 40m vaccines day.

As Canadian, surprise Covid ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù (however want visualize that) going wear masks forever, wherever go indefinitely protect every child flu? average, 150 children die influenza every year.  surprised think this. /s Trump chaos administration Biden competent administration. sarcastic, didn‚Äôt translate well print. actually think one dosing vaccine would better public health decision. true attorneys would‚Äôve done now. Plenty places CA aren‚Äôt enforcing mask mandate Yeah add anecdote pile . sister RN covid assessment centre Ontario hasn‚Äôt even received first dose yet. condescending.
I corrected it. I'm waiting mRNA vaccine. seem much effective. pandemic social standpoint people stop caring Positivity rates also going down, though. think that's it. grandparents got first shots vaccine day!! Can't happier/more excited, especially much family anti-vaxx/mask. really hope vaccinations change minds family! That‚Äôs literally capitalism. Goes right point. spent money secured doses market. It‚Äôs commodity. US jumped it. I‚Äôm saying right, that‚Äôs happened. worry it, young able deal covid problem. I'd advise getting vitamin though, always good immune system! Thanks lot, useful understand maths. even doesn‚Äôt stop serve covid? Hasn‚Äôt fucking point? USA like 72-73 years age take weighted average. agree 16 years stretch. infected Jan 8th (the peak), immune almost sudden Jan. 8th?

None natural immunity theories drop make sense. Fauci unreasonable. problem sense time. Better stop harmful mutations spreading vaccinating become widespread we're trouble waiting updated vaccine finish processed tested, repeating whole vaccination process several months harmful variant spreading. he's lose-lose situation, could least consistent messaging, *or* talk all.

And continue scream mountaintops: get vaccine can't held hostage don't. I‚Äôm supposed wear mask protect anti vaxxers? Hahahaha good one people getting worked Fauci saying masks till 2022? large parts country, people aren‚Äôt even wearing right now. Studies coming indicate vaccination stops spread, vaccines available Americans late summer absolute worst case scenario. Nobody besides truly neurotic going wear masks everyone chance vaccinated, matter said 2022? make old man go tv twice week make prediction it‚Äôs constantly changing. ya ain‚Äôt first last It‚Äôs civic duty wear mask reason protect people. fact, isn‚Äôt certain yet, it‚Äôs safe vaccinated person masked, civic duty wear prevent people lying. It‚Äôs fair it‚Äôs necessary. info stands now, vaccinated people keep wearing mask either info people vaccinated There's way tell point time travel restrictions lifted November. However, US keeps current pace, 75% population received 1st dose June 2021. &lt;--You also tailor results state wear mask law applies . vaccinated. go restaurants coffee shops occasionally. hope you‚Äôre ok that. Fuck outta this. 650 people TOTAL (in US) 15-24 died COVID. 65+, hardest hit age group, vaccinated quicker get back life. [He‚Äôs said otherwise certainly starting scratch,‚Äù Dr. Fauci told reporters. Regarding Trump administration‚Äôs vaccination effort, Dr. Fauci said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say absolutely usable coming fresh ideas, also ideas bad ideas previous administration. need vaccinate kids, since they're risk easily develop immunity infection. posts thread read like parody. people read studies believe them? Reuters edited posting. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Doesn‚Äôt matter make vaccine don‚Äôt facilities produce it. don‚Äôt get al hate Canada right now. never happened before, it‚Äôs totally unreasonable depend countries vaccines outside pandemics. anything hate rest world failing support other. waiting for? Sorry hear that. wife first Moderna last Monday. Fortunately little arm pain dealt initially. Yesterday got 'Moderna itch'. Gone today however. Hope start feeling better.... Pfizer supply going double next couple weeks. Perhaps state end bunch j j start moving things along faster although general thought much use j j. like running joke around world poke fun Americans xD Lol bs statistic it‚Äôs even funny believe get eating food. that's called OCD. keep rebook second dose vaccine shipments constantly late half expected God delusional. fun shaming everyone left right lol whiplash yet cases falling.... post comments sure age well:

/r/worldnews/comments/fhmpsi/coronavirus_vaccine_made_in_saskatchewan_canada/ That's crazy scaremongering. also reach immunity infection, younger people likely that. Also, way living covid, normal is. learn normal madness calms hope. Basically, risk people vaccinated covid longer threat there's need eliminate it. can't much longer since way damaging even covid still mean big risk. go say nothing him, yes, manufacturers agreements countries definitely fucked Canada's vaccine rollout.  state even 1B group yet see chance fall best. According government, UK vaccinated entire adult population July. may royally fucked response rest pandemic, we're shit hot vaccine lot false information disseminated; sows fear ultimately costs society immeasurably.

His interviews go long way toward getting proper information, evolves, us. understand, hampered beginning communications. doubt trying right ship, regardless fault. gives sincerity sense responsibility compassion lacking; I, one, appreciate sense duty. mean unless H5N8 decides butt fuck human race next, mostly done pandemic year. US aware citizens adults take responsibility -health- death

FTFY.. Gotta put mask help others.

Again, true US fashion, give get. Canada made decision make vaccines years ago. something turn moment's notice. boneheaded decision time, hard argue group people whose ideology ""we let market decide!"" every single thing. neutral observationally study health issues hospitalized people age groups.

How fear mongering ? :D

It neutral data. sell neighbors some. post stuff fits want hear. 2 mins Google argument much stronger. Plus, military. Can't designate barracks quarantining in? one's quarantining perfect; lot people gotten virus thought careful. would think quite possibly higher chance getting covid continuing quarantine indefinite period protection receiving less effective vaccine right away. There's still people dying here.

Thanks support though. Agreed. I‚Äôm one strictest states getting married one strictest cities we‚Äôre bit nervous. Luckily state pretty good job vaccinations, wouldn‚Äôt put past extending restrictions we‚Äôre zero. can‚Äôt realistically stop viruses naturally do: mutate. Better vaccinate everyone update vaccine needed USA quite literally withholding Vaccines countries like Canada SPEAK.

Throughout entire pandemic United States **consistently 'stolen'** supplies set aside promised countries. fact, useless little help country, Canada, Africa EU largely dependent Countries like China needs. 

So please stop convincing country actually real benefit anyone shitshow. Canada producing vaccine? Perhaps seasonal spike flu covid folks probably wear masks, yeah. Point we‚Äôll mostly normal next fall, regardless. It‚Äôs going regionally. California allow big events sometime 2022 rest country moves on. And? Canada still vaccinating *far* fewer people per capita. everyone wore damn mask day 1, would stay-at-home orders. Clear people seeing lot deaths close people.

Late lockdowns bad idea. Countries proper contact tracing, mask mandates lockdowns including border closures early got keep grandmas also economies recover quite well.

We also ignore fact countries done same, probably dealing variants like right now. it. Jesus Christ. strain somebody else‚Äôs resources change Well y‚Äôall wait vaccines guess, cuz haven‚Äôt shit. Yes want parents house ;( It‚Äôs 5 hour flights four airport visits won‚Äôt do.

If could drive, would sit backyard 6+ feet away visit. sucks. want less people! elephants, rhinos giraffes.

I say bring back polo, small pox, scarlet fever likes. 8B already many!!

and no, joking. objectively, cannot change mind. I've followed mask household-limit mandates year, I'm never-masker, gotta tell you, get vaccine longer distancing unless person wants it. Wearing mask public policy: yes. Limiting social contacts durations: no. Board game night back. nice could learn lessons this. from? US suspect general availability start April. There's good chance cases basically zero get vaccine that‚Äôs case, living solitary confinement another year two. Canada paying $2k / month anyone lost job result pandemic. Wow, 39 think 10% chance dying it. Holy shit. many kids died making cell phone think? calling us Canada's meth'ed cousins south

Guess what, still are. provide link study shows surface fomite transmission one main ways virus spreading, I‚Äôd happy read it. Or, link study showing things like groceries major contributors spread. Woah, saying Israel racist? must anti-semetic!

/s case obvious. read article. thanks.

You see family without quarantine, kid go school 2 days week, weddings church. That's really German public's fault tbf. German, French EU politicians playing politics vaccines publicly using distract failures due upcoming elections. much hate anti-vaxxers, leaders behaving like throwing misinformation around obviously directly lead public scepticism, feel sorry people there. entirely politicians' fault. cautiously optimistic

The real fact that's going bake noodle threats like covid existed entire time alive much longer.

The major difference social media intense focus it. Covid's impact mortality looking Sweden US, puts us back 2004 levels risk death. Hate person won‚Äôt wearing masks 2022 unless it‚Äôs absolutely mandated. everyone opportunity get vaccine leisure, fully vaccinated, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm done masks. risks severe COVID dramatically decreased, I‚Äôm already pretty low risk 19 ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. miss seeing people‚Äôs faces reading facial expressions. Life isn‚Äôt risk free goal isn‚Äôt eradicate virus, decrease hospitalizations/deaths. Gotta keep living. Thank comment. 

You right, normal situation. requires people work together one country jump line throwing large amounts money around. 

IMHO US allow Pfizer export vaccines countries yet vaccinated vulnerable groups. small percentage population, people highest risk dying. literally save lives! 

The EU, China Russia already that. Short answer. know. I'll make educated guess. 

The U.S huge. look data looking combined data 50 states. Europe, spend time looking individual countries instead Europe whole. 

The U.S experiencing local outbreaks time. Iowa 4239 infections week opposed 676 last week. However overall trends going think outbreaks masked general national decrease. large states well (California, Texas, NY, etc) look like entire U.S well. want compare U.S Europe, would need compare countries states. incivility üõ° Yikes. That‚Äôs say. I‚Äôm done here. recommend therapy. Isn‚Äôt weird vaccine, treatments, cases cratering yet people like Fauci acting like nothing changed form year ago? US sent sons die part Japan attacked us axis alliances drew us Europe?

Europeans even keep shit together two decades without sparking global conflict. Yeah that's says. bad. Let look, I'm almost certain bought independently. definitely linked wrong thing. Woah... re-read couple times lol we‚Äôre behind canada everyyyyything anymore? Mind... blown ü§Ø Funding resources, administration.  middle global health crisis impacts everyone requires united effort overcome take bad. possibly coming end US, worldwide there's still lot issues. Equal population city Atlanta. put number perspective.  figured, article trying cast doubt lol. calculated excess mortality, 'control' would pre-covid death averages. Brit, glad managed leave bureaucratic thought police EU get vaccine need quickly. got vaccinated wednesday feeling optimistic future. confused close school close school seems lol  Yeah fucking right üòÇ No, 3.9 million Danish part 300 millions extra doses EU purchased. extra doses benefit EU countries same. 

Text: EU indg√•r aftale med Pfizer og BioNTech om k√∏b af ekstra 300 millioner vacciner. Danmark har sikret sig 3,9 mio. af doserne Maybe consider curbside pickup items future. don‚Äôt feel comfortable person shopping due staff members, option make arrangements yourself. Ecuador better almost every country. 130/195 countries single vaccine yet. even 1. social-distancing still force. Dancing barred banquet halls. Synagogues, mosques churches required halve normal congregation sizes.

So they're open back normal. Israel likely influence countries reopen along mask use restrictions. answer followup two different things Whoa. America competent again? year correct, study look age assume dead representative general population. study methodology Wow, difference makes actually care mr people! reason starvation slavery global scale dimished considerably... 

Yes. industrial revolution led innovations agriculture shipping. recent innovations farming techniques, GMOs, led increased yields better logistics reduced spoilage. yet food insecurity rise nationally worldwide last decade (even covid). dichotomy. 


And think free market reason apparently less slavery world today natural progression society towards equitable egalitarian values? hits right feels. Hopefully heal this. Well facts facts.   Well gone approval still testing storage methods? get still add me. US reported 40% covid fatalities nursing homes. Statistically someone nursing home average less year live.

This would mean 60% would ""years life lost"" 26 order bring average 16. fatalities primarily people 70's 80's fatality rate low among age 50-65.

I think article conflating statistics omitting fact average covid fatality 2.8 serious health conditions (diabetes, cancer, heart disease, emphysema) must counting healthy. lose funding, distance learning useless rewarded fair them, Conservative government 1980s shut down. multiple governments stripes since nothing restore them. Maybe. hand ""Single dose AstraZeneca vaccine could cut transmission 67%"" really know well vaccines till protect long haul stuff yet. That's one thing I'm happy about, didnt gyms, literally wouldnt left house year. Finally news doesn‚Äôt make embarrased American. Relevant article Harper bad comments

The former CEO GlaxoSmithKline Canada Canada able acquire vaccine Liberal government virtually relationship buyer regulator organizations could possibly produce vaccine quickly sufficient quantities, global innovative pharmaceutical Successive Liberal governments, including one, created unfavourable environment investment commercial success innovative pharmaceutical companies Canada. made difficult Canadian CEOs attract investment Canada despite many attempts industry work governments so. made effort work innovative industry encourage partnership could deliver tremendous value health-care system economy give Canadians early access new medicines surprisingly, industry gone elsewhere invest ‚Äî places like U.K., U.S. EU positive environment exist. performing better Canada early vaccine acquisition. senior public health official Israel recently stated one reasons country able acquire large quantities doses good relationship pharmaceutical unfavourable environment roots Trudeau government 1968 effective elimination pharmaceutical patents. lead hollowing-out innovative industry emergence generic-company oligopoly supported successive Liberal Mulroney Harper governments supported innovative industry improving patent landscape Canada partially recovered day globally competitive patent protection. negative trend continues even imminent implementation punitive pricing regime new federal (Patented Medicine Price Review Board) regulations.

Liberal government pharmaceutical policy failed Canadians time greatest need. mean like NZ, Taiwan, South Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam? back normal without lockdowns months now. Damage pandemic? Sounds pretty routine look human history. USA: 19 doses per 100

Justin's Canada: 3.8 doses per 100 hugged quarantined 10+ days. made list huggable people short. could hug dad vaccinated like me. However, hugs sporadic family happened yet.

You‚Äôre right would proper thing can‚Äôt right get people wear mask 2 mins gas station get coke, cigs beer 30 mins grocery store.No way someone going wear mask 8 hours cold. tragic something people need realize. huge portion covid fatalities occurring people already near end lives. make ok different situation Spanish Flu average age 28, opioid epidemic likely lower that. Denmark side deal Pfizer supplement EU vaccines... bought additional 3.9 million doses directly Enjoy ban üòá result insults you‚Äôve already lost argument. see posts pointless vulgar.

Repost, sorry! that's good thing. understanding mRNA vaccines RNA enters cells causes produce spike proteins, immune system learns attack. happens wRNA? body perpetually produce coronivirus spikes, RNA get eliminated somehow? Listen wear mask forever want dont force others tho number thrown around US usually 39% fatalities occur nursing autistic canadian mad. wear glasses. rub eyes lot... I'm sorry hear that, I'm crossing fingers get ASAP. Making predictions 2022 fools errand given can't even predict virus 6 weeks now. Yup. I‚Äôm adjunct faculty arts college too, people teach industry 30/40+ years looking ways supplement upcoming retirement. I‚Äôm 35, it‚Äôs hard enough thinking changing careers much school/dues paid - can‚Äôt imagine people older me, teaching &amp; playing longer, feeling. Good luck  Canaan

I've never heard it. Good know :) Poor souls. May RIP ? no. Apparently baldness risk factor severe covid average fatality around age 80 with, average, 3 serious health conditions (diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc). actuarial tables show lifespan people guessing around 5 years.

This something lot people realize, 80-90% fatalities 12-15% population elderly health conditions. like masks too, brush teeth months.   Nope. Half United States populace going come thing thinking hoax even distrust scientific consensus. Um yeah we‚Äôre talking government given reasonable metrics goals lifting it‚Äôs new mandatory dress code

How hell ~ crazy ~ want know mandates lifting  F day cannot come soon enough. u gotten shot yet? good news is, variant notwithstanding, lockdown absolutely crushed transmission. We've halving cases every week last three. 15000/day peak 1500/day now. Schools closed, restaurants closed, non-essential shops closed, work home, weekend curfew - garages, hardware stores etc still running, plenty traffic. place overrun lockdown septics, deniers, anti-maskers. stepped away month two surge. It‚Äôs Donald crowd sudden. Fauci increasing anti-vaxx sentiment telling people still wear masks even vaccinated. think Danes optimistic side scale. calculation assume vaccines approved supplied promised producers. It‚Äôs certainly possible happens, also Curevac doesn‚Äôt get approved Novavax J&amp;J deliver less promised. AZ unfortunately deliver even less thought initially, offset increased deliveries Pfizer. mean, timelines don‚Äôt involve deliveries US. But, they‚Äôve done sufficient amount vaccination, could see opening deliveries use would really speed things up. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs best interest neighbouring country vaccinated to.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I‚Äôm sorry hear that. Must lot variation; that‚Äôs always issue anecdotal information. Thank work do. Doors kept shut safety reasons? US already open places. Short limited seating restaurants bars movie theaters, schools closed partially. will. Vaccine takes couple weeks kick in. know Nevada opening plan starts March things pretty good normal summer. don‚Äôt care ineffective bloated bureaucracy says. Time give kids normal lives back next school year latest. respect opinion, think right one. I'm picturing roles reversed situation would playing out. doubt mind Canada would sending vaccines States. least small amount help kick start program. arbitrary border thousands people still cross every day essential travel never safe countries safe. United States vaccinating 50 60-year-olds 90-year-old grandmother still waiting. 

As said, respect opinion, understand American government doing, sucks living next biggest manufacturer planet, number one ally (or used Trump labeled us National Security threat), far behind them. 

I'm optimistic though. think we'll end 2-3 months behinds guys. going give Conservatives absolute field day though. They'll use small delay behind biggest campaign attack next election Conservative governments let manufacturing escape overseas. Deleted first post, one? masks become bipartisan issue. politics it. Credible science lead way. I‚Äôm trying super optimistic, I‚Äôm getting nervous November wedding. We‚Äôre stricter state wedding large city, lots town guests. vendors super great, worry suddenly going right wedding, really firm restrictions still up. Obviously want wedding safe, vast majority people I‚Äôm worried catching Covid vaccinated. Sorry rambling, planning wedding Covid turned brain anxious mush. Costco: get ladies give free samples. Europe sent us vaccines. India offered send us vaccines. US refused. Um, doesn‚Äôt US like 100 times Canada‚Äôs population? Canadian nurse major hospital, yet vaccinated. Im happy friends lot us problem helping neighbors north get high rist population taken care of. 

There might logisitical crap needs handled first. trucks get stuck borders, making switch canadian driver, political BS. Based people home town Seattle, mask empty beach people within 200 feet them, think there‚Äôs going large percentage people going masking long it‚Äôs necessary I‚Äôm talking Canadians. U.S. (probably fairly) criticized sluggish initial vaccine rollout, 100% obvious would also criticized soon caught using many vaccines.  That's goes. dichotomy. There's reason starvation slavery global scale dimished considerably... introduction free markets. free produce without hindrance centralized authority, prosper. People acting like early summer far away. grand scheme things, vaccinating enough population reach basic normalcy, early summer know it. think necessarily manufactured America

You clearly ill-informed thinking about. Every country pandemic, Canada would able manufacture supplies. places don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs friends right now, want populations vaccinated mess quickly possible restart economies. saw someone ABC News say pretty much impossible ever reach true herd immunity without vaccinating younger age groups, 16 younger. age group makes big portion population. we'll probably never reach high enough immunity threshold totally eliminate community spread. words, believes COVID-19 never fully eradicated like Smallpox, also believes reduced low levels like Polio.

What means would ""return normal"" somehow, without ever truly eliminating COVID-19 lives. words, COVID would remain part lives forever.

I'm sure looks like long term perspective. We've learned live COVID-19 world, many people heatedly disagree live it. Obviously still reacting extreme way, schools businesses remain closed world varying degrees. entire countries shut down, states US shut down, others done less so, pretty huge debate.

It's difficult wrap mind around different possibilities play out. life look like year today, five years? 

I know I've fought tooth nail arguing people when/how would get back normal, one thing acknowledge cannot ""do forever."" can't. Even admit that.

My question is, ""normal"" truly look like? COVID always around, relegated particularly nasty flu mass vaccinations? continue getting vaccine shots different COVID strains every year? still occasional outbreaks prompts localized quarantines closures? don‚Äôt expect US help, roll eyes saying US doesn‚Äôt help Canada whining Canada helping US. could hope voted horrendous leader? fault didn‚Äôt lie lack Canadian help. One issue slow vaccine rollout gives virus chance adapt vaccinated. It‚Äôs better US get fully vaccinated send vaccines Canada others, US cut rollout speed half Canada others increase theirs. countries slower rollout odds virus adapting increases. 

Does suck Canadians? Absolutely. wish alternative didn‚Äôt increase risk everyone. many articles lately talking high risk slow vaccine deployment US country vaccine manufacturing ‚Äúin house‚Äù slows rollout provide slightly faster rollout others creating potential risk reward. Huh? sure follow whataboutism logic.

Did insinuate worry virus global pandemic car fatal accidents?  UK Pfizer vaccines administered Astrazeneca.. Many EU countries approved vaccine don‚Äôt offer senior citizens there‚Äôs much data efficacy older adults. side effects correlation vaccine effectiveness. Majority folks going side effects beyond sore arm headache. Lack side effects good thing, nothing worry about. Remember, vaccines little side effects. Life returned normal you‚Äôre really wealthy tho. feel you. reminded pedantic ‚Äúdroplets vs aerosols‚Äù debate year ago. saw plenty evidence *suggesting* transmits readily air, masking makes sense. *might* turned inhalation primary mechanism, take simple precautions?

I see similar dynamic here, though seems fomitic transmission small percentage total cases, *not* mean really ‚Äúhard‚Äù infect touching things touching eyes/nose/mouth, putting infected things directly mouth. know rest I'd accept problem meant stupid 6pm curfew lifted earlier... still gonna place July rate. I'm bit scared rn. person came house, stayed 20 min ate stuff. touched front mask lot, pulled speak people, touched mouth later door without washing hands


As young person gone long time (so I'm probs ded low vit d) someone thermometer can't check develop fever either, fucked due this? severe risk due this? ...Massachusetts less 7 million people American... Good. citizen country pays taxes. get vaccinated vaccines you. Period.  Can't wait get vaccinated March 2022. I'm happy people getting vaccines getting (regardless country), scary anything knowing vulnerable here. 

Can't fucking wait vote NDP next time. got fucked really hard. 

-a Canadian Mobility way holiday season. actually totally expected this. US excels innovation logistics. also places high premium personal freedom. Europe Canada kind opposite. I‚Äôm expert means, US manufacturing vaccine here. Canada export it. know lot political stuff background, I‚Äôm pretty sure lot it. think fair nice behaviour would give vaccines countries thus saving chance vaccine higher. E.g. country progressed much already vaccinating healthy 18-50yr olds, give still need vaccinate frontline healthcare workers. Dang, know that. What‚Äôs deal Canada‚Äôs supply? Putting morals kindness aside, would think concentrating vaccine auS would make sense virus gets erratically area worst right likely fueling variants could potentially dsngerous. it‚Äôs Pfizer Moderna doses same. Majority people don‚Äôt sided effects beyond sore arm headache. There‚Äôs indication side effects = greater immunity. vaccines little side effects work great. Hope eases anxiety bit :) US UK horrible outbreaks early became obvious containment/mitigation going possible. US, took long time get public board prevention techniques. largely influenced public battle health officials previous administration. British American citizens struggled accept lockdowns well.

As result, countries realized quick vaccination way out. poured ton money inked expensive deals vaccine manufacturers basically made favored nations distributions. formed even tighter grip manufacture take place within borders. 

That aside, see case vaccines going Canada. US time 4x per capita infection rate 8x population Canada. absolute terms, that's **32 times** many people getting infected. goal vaccine save many lives possible, regardless nationality. Clearly US vaccination campaign save amount people. someone received doses, I'm 14 days clear second dose, safe see parents? good news time people risk hospitalization death prioritized vaccination, even infections start start ticking back expect corresponding number hospitalizations. already probably see numbers. look total hospitalizations US, we're roughly rate first week October 2020, beginning seasonal uptick. overall infection rate closer end October almost doubled beginning month. break data age groups also see much steeper decline hospitalization rate 65+ compared younger groups. Thanks (in)actions previous administration, US month away seeing 5,000 deaths day. definitely help world, country literally control. Hopefully things stabilize, start helping others out, even position (which position US lot experience in...another first 45). people need set expectations. probably around June people able get first shot. Good luck. understand last March didn‚Äôt know anything, today? Seriously? Nope. Canadians naive ones voting people beleived fallacy post nationalism. People always what's self interest that's perfectly fine. biggest realization coming pandemic US national government simply fucked. need deal something big important national level, we‚Äôre fucked. Like next virus 5% 15% death rate spreads fast? way national government responded virus, got jealous places like Australia Japan essentially level freedom have, also functioning national governments mobilize crisis. 

I say, vaccine rollout really heartening. think it‚Äôs bit naive/partisan say it‚Äôs 100% changeover administration, think re-empowering experts sycophants really helped. Nice see government still capable big things. good, country need protection getting protection need. agree US sending some, selling some, one caveat, specifically crisis.

We Trump &amp; government genuinely every turn, made actual worst choice handling pandemic.

We shoved spoke bike tire reason ate shit.

So, need massively recover complete fucking Right-wing sabotage, could resources help out.  from? ant colony population 33 billion? Yeah, forget. could delay one day whole country could running again.  Sure. That‚Äôs choice missed point entirely, well done.

Yes, happen, obviously, happened specifically SARS-CoV-2. I'm denying case. I'm saying illogical get worked something happened likely happen, i.e going back step zero due change functions due mutation.

The current known ones big deal, it'll take metorite impact directly head level effort be. see you‚Äôre worried 21,000 45-55 year olds died covid. worried 180,000 causes?  You‚Äôre likely kill die covid 45-55. Kids 7 times likely die downing covid. Irrelevant comparison...but ok? I'm sure country doubt they're going sit hand menu ask ""which vaccine would sir like?"" like rude tells amirite Uhhh. Make vaccine? would Canadian government depend countries help population pandemic. year. Canada fuckin up. can‚Äôt spin vaccine manufacture scratch year.

I agree logically American shouldn‚Äôt put equivalent Canadians Americans 80 year old Canadians vs 20 year old Americans. We‚Äôll get point America vaccinating low risk populations high risk Canadian populations still waiting. Nice, open back up. High risk folks safe. ridiculous point lol

Myself several others it, lived lol subreddit literally posting daily basis republicans' states deaths democrats states talk like ""win"" twisted shit. Funny thing 2 states highest death rate democrats. vaccinate everyone become non issue Yeah assuming teachers, elderly, high risk individuals, first responders, heath care workers, vaccinated then, hospitals overwhelmed, what's fear I'd virus circulating around kids, show little symptoms? Already thing: Self scanning ftw Yes America (hopefully) pitch take care first. mostly vaccinated, able better logistics front help Canada others more. Please report comments break sub-rules address them. There's paywall-type-thing - anyone copy paste article here? Israel literally population size city New York. much easier gold standard small separate country, meaning could get deals vaccine companies get enough doses population promise share real-time data (which exactly Israel did). Still waiting bunch family 75+ get vaccinated good ol' USA. Look, didn‚Äôt state personal opinion all, please save vitriol. hate teaching online teacher wants hybrid model. It‚Äôs twice work lower student outcomes.

All I‚Äôve said district deciding. That‚Äôs true all. 9 months current rate would open everyone it‚Äôll go much faster NY set competitive get vaccinated first, rather number severity risk factors. told category opened 15th false. actually opened 14th, missed out. next category include even larger number people, probably wont get vaccinated September. waste life. younger ppl arent much risk anyway stay inside then. Prince Charles visiting Philip hospital another glaring recent example sort thing you‚Äôre talking swear, US responding well enough virus vaccinations, world poked fun us, calling us Canada's meth'ed cousins south. we're making better progress, people complaining getting American assistance vaccinations quickly they'd like. Can't make anyone happy. think necessarily manufactured America. America buying power. people want example amazing seat belts are, person survive crash killed Princess Diana wearing seatbelt. Aha xD come Canada behind even US percent population vaccinated? (0.83% vs. 5.47%)? Average median? sounds like latter Develop/ manufacture vaccine Canada works incredibly hard aid allies... known for. almost identity.

Sours know people reciprocate cards reversed. like asking free stuff, gladly pay required. read similarities French experience pretty striking. imagine countries got hit hard would sort stories tell. worst little regular people it. least France, doubt party would fared much better. think happened bc Moderna Pfizer *such* incredible results, headlines led impressive stat: 95% protection even getting *infected*.

The problem is, set bar people looking for. AZ/j&amp;j etc came out, number everyone looking for.

If lede Moderna/Pfizer ‚Äú100% protection hospitalization death,‚Äù headlines AZ J&amp;J would also ‚Äú100% protection hospitalization death‚Äù people would hardly even notice difference. ""The reality virus pose serious risk vast majority population""

There newer pretty big study uk ""sage"" issue.

Can't pharma companies let canada manufacture it, see issue. least normal outdoor activities fine summer especially vaccines play unlike last summer? probably enough data showing viral spread bad outside inside. going beach park fine. society work indoor things like cinemas, full schools, &amp; symphonies autumn large summer push vaccinations done. lol? go home He‚Äôs also saying particular looks like. reward getting vaccinated keep wearing masks. Right. Something tells that‚Äôs going fly public. What's preventing nations like Canada producing own? genuine question curiosity.  title makes sound like Canada million people. Closer 10x Stop minimizing dear leader's failure. Canada ranks 57th world vaccination % population, accounts population size. best husband. Given vaccines operate similar mechanism exposing body spike protein antigen, I'd say highly likely adenovirus (J&amp;J, Oxfard/AZ) vaccines also reduce transmission rate roughly line rate prevent symptomatic infections. hate defeatist attitudes. uphold everything intellectual property supplying pulp n95. 

If Trump you‚Äôd get entirely different narrative it, would even bet government would step more. Ok there's many people canada. US expected everything everyone. also expected pay it. US gave ton money get vaccines market fast possible make sure money wasn‚Äôt issue. countries mad sharing vaccinate own. giving foreign financial aid country world

Everyone wants criticize US start pulling weight monetarily. Start donating equal portion GDP defense America doesn‚Äôt cover there. There's cultural issue EU that's really similar US. Western culture cut unified response long term personal responsibility. doctors trying make plans virus one brought sociologists, psychologists marketing specialists. 

Smart people really dumb figuring motivates actions. spent whole year doctors pleading TV impact never thought change approach. US too, expect. rep guys do, likely export hundreds millions even billions doses near-ish future. sincerely doubt even Canada would export doses enough cover population. Well child guess. cares people's lives right? I'm confused article headline. like editor wrote headline didnt bother read article, math.

It say anywhere US immunizing 36 million people day, case would immunized 2x10 days, faster 2 shots timeline 14 days.

Also, claiming 1.4 million doses given Canada equivalent 2.65% getting single shot suggests 52 million people Canada. nuance writing about.

Still, government handled well. many squeaky wheels getting grease. That‚Äôs great that‚Äôs rate, 1.7m day 50m plus already vaccinated, need 176 days fully vaccinate virus. 125-135 days (4 months, probably less increased production), see normalcy come about. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs case. It‚Äôs really nice description truth it. balance, think US done better fronts Canada. I'm confused article headline. like editor wrote headline didnt bother read article, math.

Fair enough. disagree. imagine first month two would go way (get everyone 75 vaccinated). almost month 4 though. Hey, maybe I'm jealous country take seriously going back normal even leave houses. COVID going many many decades, wear mask till completely eradicated?     
This honestly nonsense, someone fully vaccinated see reason continue wearing masks Lots countries size smaller well. People advanced nations concerned cheap. nations logistics problem. first world nations people want effective option full stop former kid myself, think briefly summarize younger generation‚Äôs thoughts plan:

Mexico travel restrictions far know, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll allowed. understand everyone downvoting you. companies made contracts countries said would send soon possible, federal government stepping preventing sending vaccines wrong, especially since us fucked response covid.

We vaccines never received funding operation warp speed instead countries can't get doses yet? 

I agree need become less dependant anything like happen dependant others, companies making deals agreements told honor extent Moderna Pfizer trial 12-16 already started, seems like recruitment better expected. 

&amp;#x200B;

As kids 11 younger, seems like they're protected. Harder catch infected bounce right back up. School infections seems 10+ y/o range. sure state, Michigan claims 12% vaccinated, 3 populated counties comprise 40% state population vaccinated less 5% residents. I've hunkering last year, primarily mom lives high risk due age, still can't get vaccinated. She'll 75 couple months. friends family 75 still able vaccinated yet.

This positive story get 65+ high risk people vaccinated. Even OP isn‚Äôt US, process easing restrictions states horrendous.  Yah corporations, much Especially old. A-Z vaccine work well fr them, suspect we'll see something similar vaccines (which means people take care elderly really need vaccinated). whining Canada helping. pointing Canadians currently whining America helping Canada help America before. in, expect us send supply Canada people gotten yet, especially like ""owe"" Canada (because help us before. need help then, need help now. one owes anyone).

Some people act like America, great evil, somehow betraying Canada sending over. We're not.

It might seem like Canadians pov, still lot Americans desperate vaccine can't get yet. Many areas still working logistics get out. Things seem ramping hopefully March productive month, make sense us send supply counties currently getting enough. Hopefully spring, we'll position help Canada right now. [read superbowl effect florida either. H th good. hit elderly hard NY...who definitely least 5x likely die average person...there‚Äôs reason Cuomo getting slammed hiding nursing home deaths...

I don‚Äôt dispute bad data March April...it awful...but wave elderly deaths spring would definitely explain deaths higher... So, started vaccinating kids yet yet studied. done year. that, vaccinating kids en masse enough people vaccinated herd immunity achieved. right, never ""go away"", likely annual booster shot like flu carry life. Great post. know America bit reputation coming late (looking you, World Wars) case whole world basically watched us model Fuck Pandemic Response. characteristically-late response scaling becoming effective, little galling hear countries claim helping them. American passports accepted virtually anywhere year (rightfully so) we're cool again? feels gross. 

Of course, one world want help whenever can, end expect US produce export many hundreds millions doses coming months years. think rest world much leg stand demand doses us ourselves. reported here, complaining people sharing rejoice. makes sense people would make bigger deal upswing sitting waiting day people realize global pandemic disease respect national borders. Yeah guys used hated globally, know. Yeah, rest country also got crash course save elderly...

And winter we‚Äôve 9 months learning treat covid patients, thus deaths would lower...

Not sure defining ‚Äúwinter‚Äù case total, we‚Äôve also spent winter vulnerable either partially fully vaccinated...

Point is, say explanation bad data flat wrong... Nothing ever 100% safe, reality yes safe. Go see parents, I'm sure miss you. Funny ""America bad rest world good Canada better"" sentiment changing sudden.... wonder China likes announcement Thank Operable windows near gas meter gas code violation. I'll bet ones screwed closed. think it‚Äôs 20% eligible population get vaccine think Canada would make sure Canadians get vaccinated send extra no, unfortunately help getting covid point.

I‚Äôm also Canadian FWIW. Canada needs stop expecting they‚Äôre nice people, expect people return favour. procure vaccines want, people science tech leave Canada. They‚Äôre funded paid well, say someone works states well. conditions better Canada lags behind. 

We sent away bunch n95s China expected return pandemic hit us. Really? 

If shoe foot, Canadians would saying shit spouting bunch garbage like half population doesn‚Äôt believe virus anyway, trump. 

Canadians like act like they‚Äôre nice guy time know way around.. would exact same. free healthcare tho right ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì going happen. I've read vaccines safe covid past cannot tell someone get vaccinated whilst still infection. Biden figurehead. handlers true presidents. happen, risk, would illogical public health expert worried this?

""not big deal"" understatement considering U.K variant driving force behind England's third lockdown, something they're worried here. 

False optimism exactly ended deep pandemic begin different sharing. like Canada shared vaccines countries.

It's quite telling Canada's advanced covid vaccine planned manufactured US, got money build factory 10 years ago part U.S. pandemic preparedness budget, Canada denied excellent effectiveness widespread variants, considering deaths serious disease. performance metric relevant context.

It also 1/20th price mRNA vaccines, lot straightforward store, transport, prepare, less opportunity introduce human error. best practical choice. Yah states pretty messed systems. Luckily capacity overwhelming inefficiency  CanSino great bet Agreed! ""some degree normality"" probably means exactly says does. Normal maybe wear mask hospital something. going play Americans favourite pass time ""Preexisting conditions!"" 2 friends bad enough ICU. tell stories rooms people dying around them, ward filled screams pain bad. definitely PTSD. gave one friend bad March sent home hospital full time. still talks afraid go sleep sure would wake up. probably PTSD, too. Even was, best way kill anything food cook it. eat deli meat always grill microwave it. Thankfully I'm U.S. freedom decide, even decide want vaccine üëç I'd bet ones got vaccinated first ones responsible get-go, therefore less risk. that's true, exaggerate efficacy. never-gonna-get-me-and-just-a-flu-anyway types tail end vaccine queue still keeping numbers high, else think stop worrying go party grandma vaccinated. suspect they're included efficacy going drop somewhat (but getting vaccine still lot better getting COVID). Also, there's 52 countries ahead Canada vaccination rollout, kind idiotic mad USA. mad incompetent fools federal level who's jobs secure Vaccines us. Us resident Mexico wondering girlfriend (Mexican) allowed travel back Colorado negative covid tests. hard time finding initiate information. Thank Depends are. live Ohio, 80% back normal. masks certain level theatrics, would never know pandemic thing. Michigan Pfizer factory making vaccines. Good thing Pfizer said doses double next couple weeks Ok, maybe it‚Äôs decision go Florida? don‚Äôt go maybe let make decisions. getting vaccinated help already covid? 

My grandparents tested positive covid couple days ago country started vaccinating people within age group. fear might make it, especially grandmother since medical conditions make extra vulnerable. 

So wondering getting vaccinated could help get covid easier. Oh dear even removed.

I guess Israel strong support sub. arent able fly self isolate? allowing while? /r/shitamericanssay Yes US hardest hit country one largest manufacturers earth? course would be! last 200-year history built helping other. allies going gets tough? I‚Äôm inclined believe hospitals become less stressed, begin admitting critical cases. 

That number seems point homeostasis, won‚Äôt drop bc accept ‚Äúmilder‚Äù cases, even though, ideal world, many cases hospitalized anyway, except hospitals overwhelmed adopt higher standard admission . believe Moderna's booster higher concentration/dose compared Pfizer. People getting Moderna regime expressed side effects Pfizer. stomach issues nausea/vomiting reported Moderna side... Mom till got vaccinated, fully vaccinated aren‚Äôt anymore. Netherlands Europes vaccine laughing stock we're 60% ahead. Every single post Israel propaganda. never mind is, life Palestinians politics worth discussing anywhere days. Sure, Canada helps allies lot. Even start pandemic. don‚Äôt think Canada would help allies expense citizens lives. Sending masks supplies sending vaccines save lives.

Governments need prioritize citizens health security jumping support others. Maybe there‚Äôs sort middle ground there, considering condition US in‚Ä¶ certainly don‚Äôt blame focusing citizens. P.S. Yes, agree comment nonsensical contradiction. Well thats delusional take. would make sense densely populated areas would still infections less populated places. see evidence vaccination post infection antibodies aggregate slowed spread. That's prerogative course. two issues consider. First imagine China decided stop sending microchips United States sent Europe instead kept might impact global trade. bad practice although without precedent. Second case disease like coronavirus need fight globally locally. actually bad United States long run Canada Mexico continue high rates covid. people invested much work-from-home lifestyle. wonder many people moved house home-office remodelling last spring thinking going go several years. thousands hole thousands gone bank work environment may use beyond year companies start wanting people back office. 23andme sequences 0.02% entire genome. That's scratching surface. Plus tests certain variants (albeit large number), test EVERY known Neanderthal variant. would likely need entire genome sequence. match 80% variants 23andMe tests for. Granted still big number variants.

There's reason 23andMe raw files hundred MB whole genome 150GB+. kid doesn‚Äôt need mask. 

Relax. Someone else wearing mask choice harm kid. Case rates smallish city (150k) already getting close, 20-30 cases per day tending down. They‚Äôve already vaccinated 15% city.

I know everyone mask far pretty insane numbers vaccinations. summer probably won‚Äôt much matter anyone wears huge amount population vaccinated. take. Anything 75% ish goal.

Saying ""I want wait I'm scared long covid"" helping us get need get. selfish outlook putting others risk. hide behind disability expect world back off. YOU. ""Non-essential"" means essential functioning society fundamental level. ""essential"" means business employs people... yeah literally business would considered essential using argument. no, think theme park attracts people country/world, especially one tiny Disneyland, essential employs lot people. 

But overall, yes agree stranglehold non-essential businesses needs loosened soon. There's going third lockdown, politicians careful pulling trigger reopening. People cooperating right now, patience wearing thin. Officials need sure possibility outbreak minimized one going return prevention measures. Nope, never implied that. everyone chance get vaccine. it‚Äôs irresponsible someone follow guidelines they‚Äôre protected. vaccines readily available, masks bleeping gone. re-heat takeout food

Yeah one makes sense. live suburban area, work sort-of-urban area, food still lukewarm order Friday Doordash. heating good thing!

I get saying though. weird pick-and-choose science.

""Science says vaccines effective variants"" results ""WELL STILL WORRY THEM.""

""Science says there's evidence COVID-19 transmission surfaces food"" results ""WELL I'M STILL GOING THEATER ANYWAYS."" Sure, Canadians get stay inside homes. Americans go outside play.

Lol doofuses posted article lol vaccines zero effect right UK US new numbers. takes months see effect. herd immunity. 
Plus people UK single dose. teachers well! I‚Äôd rather fellow teacher friend vaccinated who‚Äôs around kids day I, zoom calls, etc. would like chap lives, clubs closed since last march, outdoor events possible summer, heavily regulated. living ""normal live"" going clubbing, legally... Link? fair point. think you‚Äôre dealing many cases given testing change then, you‚Äôre probably looking high level hospitalizations still. 

I‚Äôm board getting life back normal tomorrow btw. trying realistic. friendly reminder ""Conspiracy Theorist"" term specifically created slander discourage people counter-narrative thinking. would likely winter storms. people spent months screaming ‚Äútrust science‚Äù call science propaganda one gonna things demand dog pony show. We‚Äôre right science data says risk, majority vaccinated covid rates get sub 1000 per day, people going getting back life, sans masks. give shit ""people"" saying it?  There's got logistic ceiling coming, though, right? site parents self report long term symptoms without involvement anyone medical expertise?

Isn't kind like anti-vaccination movement collects stories parents kids got ""vaccine damaged""? actual proof connection gut feelings parents. Thanks Anthony, I‚Äôll pass. understand comment. 

San Francisco second-most densely populated city US. far lower rate infection many rural areas. 

And despite far fewer people immunity, ALSO big drop cases holidays. 

So mean? insights happens everybody offered vaccine? point vaccinated covid won‚Äôt kill you.

It still kill cancer patient can‚Äôt get vaccinated though. move despite coronavirus tbh Andrew Gas Breaks administering vaccine thumbnail? don‚Äôt agree person posted early childhood education incredibly important. know everyone goes Kindergarten, many fine without (usually wealthier involved families, experience preschool). some, it‚Äôs first time interacting peers hour time. it‚Äôs first time they‚Äôve seen book. first time sit desk. may see looking numbers, letters, colors think important, learning learn. socialize. don‚Äôt know sounds letter makes, trying read first grade seem insurmountable.

It‚Äôs pandemic. It‚Äôs new. ONE KNOWS FIR SURE HAPPEN WHEN. isn‚Äôt true. US sent two stimulus checks paying extra $600 per week ($2,400 per month) towards extended unemployment benefits, top usual unemployment would be. That‚Äôs actually Canada doing. makes failures like EU worse really. I'm genuinely shocked well Boris/UK Trump/Biden/US top vaccine stuff, credit due. Shame fucked everything else. origins virus unknown. speculated came wet markets proven. also could lab leak lab wuhan gain function research. group trying determine virus' origin now. sense duty including lying Americans masks resulting deaths.  think lot blamed pandemic well. Front line hcw here. vaccinated gotten timeline yet. drop misleading headlines? that's really said. Hahaha. checking. don‚Äôt know manufacturing Canada didn‚Äôt want assume Well, I'm Canadian detest Conservatives here, they're going successfully use issue attack Trudeau. way pandemic ends vaccinate way herd immunity, close it, rate never get there. Trudeau might good excuses, they're excuses me. economy suffering badly cannot fix pandemic control. Trudeau invoked Emergency Act year ago build vaccine production facilities (the Conservatives shuttered power, much fault theirs, Trudeau PM must take primary responsibility). Justin's Canada So, what, dump whole shipment recieved beginning February? Surely vaccine better none all? Talk shit healthcare free. Even vaccinated everyone USA split second right now. still dropped ball let many die it‚Äôs failure regardless. anything it‚Äôs USA posters acting smug. Nothing USA‚Äôs handling covid applauded. got lucky vaccine came along halt disaster, nothing more. honest, I‚Äôd willing bet China purposefully made virus countries would lag behind progress. 

They knew US wouldn‚Äôt strict enough execute proper lockdown could, guaranteeing success throwing developed countries bus.

Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs little suspicious they‚Äôre refusing investigations highest GDP economic crash? border completely open trade. study hospitalized patients confirmed cases tell us anything degree need vaccinate general population? sufficient testing substantiate percentage actually infected disease, let alone many suffering ill effects. happens, study people already sickened hospitalized make case wide implementation vaccines, reiterates needs most. 

I'm making case vaccines. also understand powers every reason incentivize broad swath society possible get one. First all, already paid it. Secondly, know significant proportion refuse it, need convince many undecided maximize potential effectiveness. Given presence variants ability virus mutate even within patient weeks months, obvious outcome even 100% vaccination anything certain, many people still going get sick disease, perhaps once, regardless do. make sense chart path forward eyes open, rather deceiving people false sense security? much faith people vaccines millions people still get sick Covid, despite vaccinated? need think long term consequences chart sensible path forward based broad testing order bring general public side vaccines; focus group studies people already sick disease hospital.  doesn‚Äôt want over. So, what, dump whole shipment recieved beginning February? Surely vaccine better none all? seeing faces peers harmful. don‚Äôt care say. massive experiment psyche young children think it‚Äôs awful needs stop new school year latest. one defending hate groups.

The conservatives literally held supported rallies them.  January 6 2021 standout, even rewind 8/11/17 realize quite mistaken that.  don‚Äôt think people jailed fined misgendering someone.

That literally never happened.  again, understand important victimhood conservatives, even imagined. quite, Remember people religiously angry people called July second wave ‚ÄúITS STILL FIRST WAVE‚Äù. mean... really matter whether called first second wave? pandemic really messed people‚Äôs minds up. odd flex you‚Äôre smarter everyone else.  everyone gets vaccine wants still wear mask? don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going protect choose protect themselves. pissed vaccine companies? hurts didn‚Äôt way. 

Especially rapidly vaccine developed, it‚Äôs stretch imagine situation escaped half deaths less. par developed nations, dare say even better.

Our entire 2020 response massive wager proposition experts worthless, science subjective, realism fear mongering. 

The people country paid dearly wagers placed leaders. Italy: 5.69 Spain: 6.28 Germany: 5.81 France: 5.41

Canada: 3.72 
Doesn't seem bad though given delays liberal prime minister. Trudeau sold us China vaccines. wife nurse Winnipeg vaccinated yet. Trudeau fucking loser. country ordered 7x doses entire population, don‚Äôt understand global dynamics play limiting deliveries manufacturers. suspect UK USA backroom deals big pharma CEOs bought get doses redirected pandemics going common time goes on... let's next year then. that's said. headline misleading. basically said people vaccinated still significant spread, masks would needed much longer. get clicks, though, made nice sensationalized headline clear, sure vaccine's efficacy new mutations, including S. Africa Brazil variants. far widespread Israel US, time tell gain foothold. definitely fully support teachers vaccinated schools open, probably want teachers come back time, might teachers still waiting vaccines. think vaccines also take bit time well told two weeks second built much immunity going to, even kids' teachers might need additional week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The daycare worker thing unfortunate, think even though essential workers get treatment deserve. childcare providers think least vaccinate right state. That's... CERB is.

Maybe little research putting down.   thing comes mind Trump would never allowed happen. moment anyone disagreeing outset would fired them. 

If playing hypothetical competent administration, 100% right. message needed unified evidence based. also love point regarding smart people stupid messaging. true. would personally wait parents vaccinated. called global trade. buy something agreement deliver certain date delivered date. imagine China decided stop sending microchips United States sent Europe instead kept might impact global trade.

They would absolutely enough microchips themselves. Global trade works country produces surplus supply. case vaccines surplus.

So basically American manufacturers decided whether give American vaccine Canadian. That's pretty easy choice. microchips choice throw away trade America. Also easy choice. actually bad United States long run Canada Mexico continue high rates covid.

Canada closed border USA maybe done want make argument. lost there. Part BARDA setup handle exactly kind situation. Things like developing stockpiling vaccines dealing biological threat, pandemics emerging diseases. already engaged vaccine manufacturers projects expertise quickly assess different approaches. Hijacking here, solution pretty obvious. Want vaccine immediately? Introduce plan import bulk drugs India, testing pill/dose manufacturing steps conducted Canada. alternately figure way massively expand generic production/bulk purchasing patent medications, dropping price say 25% production cost. pill costs 10 cents make costs 12.5 cents instead whatever bullshit price now. Specifically mention Pfizer's top grossing products areas priority. Wait day. 

Holy fuck, look vaccine magically showed up! know know heard, I'll believe heard said source Point masks don‚Äôt hurt kids. Someone voluntarily wearing 10 months ‚Äî *a 100% hypothetical point* ‚Äî also harm child. 

Keeping school will, yeah. Masks, though, can‚Äôt. Weird conflate two, imho. Dr. Fauci said it‚Äôs possible may wearing masks 2022. I‚Äôm sure means wearing levels wear certain situations like large gatherings you‚Äôre fully vaccinated even large gathering okay. vaccine effective, even newer variants gives protection different ways. much pessimism. Yea words hard.  parent two young kids... Sigh. gonna long them... choose focus people learned something, changes mentality regarding fellow humans good me. No, goes %positive. way is, low %positive, also maintaining least 2 weeks. leads random appearances travel ban list. leads random states going list. means North Dakota managed that. Hawaii actually consistently list, often state so, state achieved yet, quarantining mandated. believe travel form required states, though, there's box check saying coming state quarantine list. likely get caught anyway, set fines $500 per day found violation travel restrictions. travel form submitted, violation 10 days, bit expensive mess with.  first instinct is, (a ) endless money throw around, (b ) fair, inoculated population California, covered equivalent Canada. build ridiculously high-volume distribution get far, long, long ways go.

Out curiosity, general sentiment Canada less anti-science US A? I, one, appreciate sense duty.

It's bad we're never sure sense duty requires lie American people. **Before anyone freaks out, he's saying infection levels need go vaccine levels need go up. Could months, could more.** 

""Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser Covid-19, said Sunday Americans may still wearing masks outside homes year now, even predicted country would return ‚Äúa significant degree normality‚Äù fall.

‚ÄúI want keep going baseline that‚Äôs low virtually threat,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said CNN program ‚ÄúState Union,‚Äù referring number cases nationally would make comfortable enough stop recommending universal masking. ‚ÄúIf combine getting people country vaccinated getting level virus community very, low, believe you‚Äôre going able say, part, don‚Äôt necessarily wear masks.‚Äù estimated percentage amount people vaccine phase US? least 1A? Pfizer asked go billion dollars months clear vaccine going get approved FDA. wasn‚Äôt insane decision turn down. ‚ÄúIf combine getting people country vaccinated getting level virus community very, low, believe you‚Äôre going able say, part, don‚Äôt necessarily wear masks.‚Äù

Nice headline, nyt. So, what, dump whole shipment recieved beginning February? Surely vaccine better none all? antivaxx covid forever NYT scroll way long bit good news. they‚Äôve vaccine, chances spreading virus extremely minuscule. don‚Äôt care minuscule we‚Äôd never reopen essentially telling citizens prioritizing lives foreigners people.

My take done vaccinating priority groups, nothing wrong small percentage vaccines countries, especially COVAX scheme, likely what's going happen UE US.

It minimal effect speed vaccination many candidates coming, go long way towards saving many lives. developed completely independently. Happy one people. People cuss US UK regardless do.  Near zero üòÇ. It‚Äôs amazing even adults still play make belief believe fairy tale world everyone happy safe. recommend? visual made wince. 30% people want vaccine, going start seeing use ""vaccine passport"" kind. want go movies? prove vaccinated go right in. otherwise, nope. etc.. kick people gear real fast. language making people want get vaccine don‚Äôt see point continue masking around vaccinated people. phase 3 clinical trials found MRNA vaccines moderna Pfizer 90% effectiveness preventing coronavirus infection. vaccine AstraZeneca reached 65% effectiveness. addition AstraZeneca vaccine ineffective South African variant country decided discontinue use vaccination there. states saying could doses. See analysis here: day doable month two. Potentially that, supplies able 4m per day June stick people arm fast enough. lol. alright man. get it, America's #1. wahoo best country ever. course... never stopped gathering. don‚Äôt really know anyone has. upset that, literally country gave citizens. anything America led charge Forgive ignorance here, really don‚Äôt want come across wrong way. Aren‚Äôt still risk catching spreading it, albeit less symptoms? Thank hard work work crazy environment, don‚Äôt want lessen that. False 1 2 million 2-3 months (first wave only) also nearly 300 million people. yeah, fact, sure. mean us got funding. Personally disagree I'm young person probably get vaccinated July. think older people immunized first even slows recovery, die get really sick. respect opinion. Tomorrow, might 65 million doses, close it. That's 10% way entire population US getting doses! ...do ever walk outside it‚Äôs raining, snowing, really hot? Time tell. Personally, I'm optimistic. 8 weeks since first countries started vaccinating. produce study effects 12 week delays within time frame? right. take food since last March. Considering loosening rule üôÇ Biden!!!! Let‚Äôs goooo  stunning, what's even shocking America's belief Is. Nearly 47% US electorate feel deaths someone else's problem. demise they're poor live uncrowded single family homes, overweight &amp; suffering diabetes, lazy get work home job, etc. concept public health turned head one personal responsibility. huge swath American public declared loud &amp; clear &amp; responsible health &amp; safety. EU block exports. reddit true. Vaccine exports need approval allowed export creating law made clear monitor exports don‚Äôt plan block any. background companies EU seem prioritise countries (that pay more) claim shortage. 

Here different perspective this: case EU countries decide much exported really start blocking exports point. exactly UK/ US via contracts local suppliers Canada population = 37.59¬†million (2019) 

USA population = 328.2¬†million (2019) 

When like 10x people neighbor everything.  look immature tantrum-throwers around though see they'll also refuse even wear mask beyond summer well, seems like infinitely easier less harmful way help cut infections combined vaccines. Totally agreed! see people ignoring Trickle Infections US basically year lol i'm encouraged seeing vaccinations numbers. want end fucking bad. advisories I've heard since got started found morning made specification: Wash hands contact following surfaces, 'if working lab'. Trump administration's ""plan"" let states plan actual distribution vaccines. sure much ""plan"" real sense word. would delayed approval. done tests, would starting distribution. 

Similarly probably much bigger window second doses indicated, test would delayed longer.

Its also looking like vaccine fact stop people carrying virus opposed getting sick, done tests would waited even longer.

Basically goal confirm vaccine stopped people getting sick, get out. Everything else tested after. living truly incredible time able even get vaccine year all. vaccine isn‚Äôt readily available here. lot people waiting people eligible yet. Canadian population would represent 11% US population. might better compare Canada California 39 million people. link paper?   peak 30k 35k cases America given significantly money unemployed (and employed!) Canada throughout course virus. know that's gets pushed reddit, encourage look raw data normalize timeframe (ie canada giving 2k month unemployed vs america giving 600 week plus state benefits, back effect) Maybe they're idiots then? reasons. Bear mind study comes India huge spectrum wealth poverty.

* Poor people might able afford glasses, eye exam needed even determine need glasses.

* Even buy cheap glasses, prescription likely wrong, discourage wearing them.

* India literacy rate 70%; 30% might get glasses even need them, they're also going poorer fraction

* Poor people less access eye-damaging things like screens books. 

* Lastly there's probably strong correlation people go get glasses, access medical system reasons (e.g. getting COVID test). moved goal posts summer. immunity April. normalize case data based number tests essentially nothing re-open people aren‚Äôt getting tested either rollout way beyond scuffed, also Canada dropped pfizer ramped rejected literally vaccines anyone else. plan use rely resupply backfired inevitably sidelined producing nations. mention despite full capability produce vaccines, capitalist fuckwads need make money possible pandemic. Develop vaccine think deserve others. say could perceive said? Yoooo worst everything rn!! weird significant global pandemic century one leading epidemiologists decades numerous TV appearances discuss vaccines, near future potential longer-term hampered previous administration. Really fucking weird...  Canada vaccines.

They beg India send last week. Good thing India obliged.  need change name /r/redditstrawgirlwz demand stays high production continues increase pretty limited perspective globally. us live US. 'UK variant' nice, like Spanish flu coming Spain No. Covid situation Japan compared Canada asked. Working life identical well. Motivation 0. Canadan‚Äôs upset. US population 330 million people Canada population 37 million. 37 million 11% US population. US still lot catching do. Canadians admin would done vaccine front. Trump failed literally anything else, including deal logistics actually getting vaccine people, dumped states like everything else. Dumping billions $ vaccine development pocket change federal govt, especially relative cost economic damage it. Actually, lot biologics stored - 80¬∞C freezers clinical trials stability reasons. investigating safety efficacy vaccine trials, manufacturing stability, agenda since time essence. Also, given vaccine using mRNA technology, RNA incredibly unstable degrades rather quickly, makes since storing low temps way go. alarming all, precaution make sure vaccine efficacious intended. Yep, sooner get situation control better everyone sharing everyone spending money like crazy again. call trickle vaccinations lol. ""As get fall winter, end year, agree (President Joe Biden) completely approaching degree normality,"" said ""**We're going significant degree normality beyond terrible burden us last year**.""

Agreeing means ‚Äúhedging‚Äù now. Who‚Äôd thunk it, amirite?! Found guidance CDC website response question ""do residents still need wear masks"". think constitutes ""widespread vaccination""?

*Yes. COVID-19 vaccines important tool help stop pandemic. However, even vaccination everyone continue follow the* [*current *to protect others. includes¬†wearing a* [*staying least 6 feet away avoiding crowds, following facility guidance visitation and* [*infection and* [*clean hands CDC‚Äôs current recommendations continue primary way LTCF residents and¬†HCP¬†are protected¬†until vaccination widespread.* Weeks? Justin's screwed us vaccines whole pandemic we're go begging Europeans, Brits, Americans hat hand. There's big difference random chance death take reasonable precautions, society saying they're simply tired masks bothered minimal long-term precautions kids still can't vaccine. Yikes. That's say. I'm done here. recommend therapy. know yet vaccinated folks still transmit covid? still plan wearing mask certain situations plan wearing I'm vaccinated. think meant reply someone. Right. (incorrectly) assumed 100% doctors nurses personal social circle received doses (sample size = 3, know good representation), plus sister also works healthcare got first dose, healthcare workers across country vaccinated similar rates. Based comments appears still long way go actually happens. Yup 1.8 Maybe that‚Äôs many Canadians came Florida got shots there.

Not bitter anything...
Love, Floridian. logic, shouldn‚Äôt Canada currently sharing vaccine supply countries currently 0 vaccine? teach private music academy, lucky many families transitioned virtual lessons, it‚Äôs horrible seeing what‚Äôs happening fellow teachers &amp; musicians. work - hasn‚Äôt since last March. lot orchestras come back, many theaters won‚Äôt make this, it‚Äôs devastating. Recently world famous violinist started teaching school - mean world famous, person album yo yo - take job teaching kids music fundamentals work available. We‚Äôre scared future. anything ""cringe"", can't give proper retort (or refuse to) support think I'm wrong. Domestic vaccine supply reserved Trump even started pumped manufacturers, recall correctly. really fault Biden walking back US fucking mess right now. way population let Covid run rampant, I'm shocked heard serious US VOC point country Petri dish virus replicate almost year now.

I would hope US starts getting things control they'd walk back policy beneficial countries back normal given much trade, tourism, etc goes back forth...although 0 interest visiting ever future. I'm continued mask mandates doubt part broader strategy absolutely sense scale. justify high school basketball games, concerts, in-person church mask mandate effect? may help reduce chances death [won't end prevent people infecting others getting [organ [long [blood (mild asymptomatic cases get too). I'm sure, think appointment weekend, could wrong. Vaccines protect individual, everyone needs get work. people comfortable risk covid that's choice affect vaccinated people. allowed rejoin society coercion, consent. Haha yes, spent time playing coop videos games. like way feel closer may become endemic. hope vaccination better treatments allow us move closer normal life. interested vaccines ""window protection"" another vaccine needed. hand washing still tool covid? definitely wash hands, pandemic not, I‚Äôm struggling understand packaging surfaces cannot transmit virus even though told wash hands touching objects? someone grocery store picks nose touches item, doesn‚Äôt spread it?

I‚Äôm genuinely curious dry hands wash hands/use sanitizer often destroys skin...  Nope wrong. GOT famous spectacular work AIDS. 2 presidential medals freedom. USA vaccinating 3x Canada's rate per capita Trump. ran USA Biden vaccinated nearly 5x Canada's rate. common denominator Justin ""Blackface"" Trudeau. Americans could elect Mickey Mouse President still outperform Blackface Justin. Seriously? realize would graded proper spelling. That's lame. find trade start scratch. saying Mexico says ‚ÄúEl que es perico onde quiera es verde‚Äù 

Pretty much means smart fine regardless situation. Suppose different definitions household name. it. guess hes saying poor people cant afford glasses. got pair safety glasses 6 bucks, it'll thing. prescription factor lol. blocks touching eye particles getting eyes. accounts age only, nothing regards existing health died vs average population age. Fauci way famous pandemic. never happened would already spectacular career. pioneer AIDS research instrumental getting treatments Africa. already two president al medals freedom. Wonderful. Still easy everyone. Glasses get fogged mask doesn‚Äôt stretch far, it. 

You‚Äôre displaying total lack theory mind.

It‚Äôs worst thing world year wearing masks, dismissing like it‚Äôs ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù really lousy attitude. wear long it‚Äôs something. it‚Äôs show, ‚Äúit‚Äôs lIkE hAt‚Äù isn‚Äôt good reason keep people wearing it. 5x likely walk blindly traffic fogged glasses...amiright? europe ever survive schengen? answer survived fine. 

How Europe survived tap water houses? 

Simply put, level economic social integration **far** even trying understand things might better Europe acted responsibly.. clearly hasn't. seems part psyche there.

Part acting responsibly damaging economy beyond point return, closing borders long term would state victoria 4 month lockdown almost total compliance. things mention.

But could have, right? it? would gotten much faster fewer deaths all.

Again, baffles someone oblivious to...I know, simple reality compare Australia average country Europe comes ability control borders. Fortunately, people charge aware. Higher levels education observed associated higher rates Net net though delay week places affected. coworker got pushed back late March somebody would‚Äôve wait til late March gonna find appt next week wouldn‚Äôt available coworker gotten shot. Unfortunately not, PR yet ( Canadian Vietnamese), gorvenement family visit visa. However, guaranteed grant visa ( nationality), able stay Canada longer 3 -6 months. countries haveput desinated hotels quarantine, facing 4000$ hotel quarantine fee total decide travel plus visa fee flight tickets etc...BEcause covid none jobs stable enough us affort that. beach. There's reason wear masks, since one thing outside (in generally fair weather chose visit beach) covid barely spreads, air salty tends break viruses. recent study saying outbreaks caused beach visits, UK think. child death many.

I mean, let kids travel cars swim pools. certain point, risk avoidance stops making sense. would walk five hundred miles

And would walk five hundred face ever itch? Ever get eyelash come loose get eye? Wipe sweat forehead? Yeah I‚Äôm following logic I'm sorry crass group vaccinated adults hang together without issue. unvaccinated adult, knows cancer, decides take risk hanging vaccinated friends, vaccinated friends fault cancer patient contracts COVID dies.

At point need open anybody walk Wallgreens get shot, time becomes personal risk assessment. can't hold society forever small minority people.

Those people issues every illness immunocompromised pause everything ruin everyone else. Unfortunately not, PR yet ( Canadian Vietnamese), gorvenement family visit visa. However, guaranteed grant visa ( nationality), able stay Canada longer 3 -6 months. countries haveput desinated hotels quarantine, facing 4000$ hotel quarantine fee total decide travel plus visa fee flight tickets etc...BEcause covid none jobs stable enough us affort that. headline can't right. Canada 10% US population. claimed rate, entire US would vaccinated little week. issues published available rest world.

And consequential, especially Canadians Makes wonder...the past couple days you‚Äôve epidemiologist come experts say herd immunity around corner. Fauci come panic talks masks 2022 child vaccinations mid 2022. Yet couple weeks ago talking Fall both. happened past two weeks push everything six months+? Could possibly things getting positive can‚Äôt that? trials showed reduced symptomatic Covid around 95%. question whether sterilizing immunity. every vaccine works giving sterilizing immunity expected here. studies starting show people likely getting sterilizing immunity vaccines. never advantageous position regards priorities. We're well positioned fall like lot rich countries, really care makes slightly ahead. 

It take make antigen enough world, even 1st world much worse 3rd.

No, true test potential reason get knickers twist well provinces handle suddenly millions doses available April. time plan test small scale there's excuse mess up. would like nothing freedom right now. Unfortunately get vaccine dont doesnt matter. used say get go back lives never happened. said old people vaccinated go back lives 90% old people vaccinated still happening. big guys dont want us go back normal. profit much situation. might never come back were. already seen ideas vaccinating every year, mandatory vaccinations workers, vaccinating kids... want obey hang little tiny carrot called HOPE infront faces obey - get back freedom. year. Still plans anywhere go back normal. Yeah Nate's problems generally tries political pundit. I'm going wait see happens time, make decision. guess vaccine approved FDA see commercials. Yeah, I'm curious said friend got infected different variant. I'm US tests sequenced often. Thankfully twice infected friend better go round.

Not sure I'm getting downvoted. PCR test last summer PCR test month came back positive. negative tests between. Yeah I'm fron nyc know multiple people died. tragedy. May RIP fair, they're pretty much dunking Canada's vaccine roll-out... quite frankly disastrous. Totally agree, good news good news. think majority people sub US based reading POV Canadian.

I think issue headline clickbait-shame POV publisher (Toronto area local news). Toronto based article reads ""we bad US day done months timeframe since vaccine released.""

Unless familiar cp24 POV misleading. restrictions bigger problem virus moment started. cares. Tired hearing dudes‚Äô name. Yes agree too, undoubtedly someone come say still risk even careful. care I'll bide time wait makes feel safe protected. lot different must. mandates need expiration criteria. AZ kind ignoring NIH recommendation use double proline substitution hinge keep spike protein closed conformation body needs see make good immune response. J&amp;J may similar efficacy AZ, J&amp;J likely hold much better mutant variants. 

Everyone thread talking it‚Äôs efficacy mRNA vaccines mistaken impression people‚Äôs opinion street driving this. so, governments backing away AZ advice expert advisors. Congrats!!  Small n (304), peer-reviewed (preprint). Intriguing read much now. Exactly. means responsibility government look citizens. Invest infrastructure needed get ahead future pandemics health issues instead moving like every-day citizen. They‚Äôre based reality they‚Äôre still thinking Could be. ever seen commercial HOV vaccine? one side effect given. -- feel like would help it, honestly.

It's poorly-designed, undersized traffic, encourages people legit fight eachother spots. curious, potential getting one variants? Last saw vaccines particularly protect variants. 

I want come across pessimistic anything I'd obviously love get back normalcy, guys getting back knowledge variants that's probably fantastic news. get it. remember sub posting articles Canada going buy hundreds millions doses needed extra help Americans. Saaame swab data say has. appears vaccine reduced number people showing PCR positivity 50 70%. actual numbers -67% first dose -54% overall, wouldn‚Äôt read anything difference, confidence intervals two measurements completely overlap. looks like everything shifted: hospitalized cases end able stay home moderate symptoms, people would moderate symptoms end asymptomatic, people would asymptomatic end testing positive all. Oh, people would died stayed alive. There‚Äôs that, kind intuitive also follows it‚Äôs similar vaccines. shifts spectrum. 

It appears everyone ‚Äòpresymptomatic‚Äô (aka, contagious) gets shifted towards ‚Äòasymptomatic‚Äô asymptomatic cases shift towards illness thus doesn‚Äôt ever transmit virus. 

Plus data coming Israel, ongoing. Things looking up. need get vaccines arms. wish Texas would this! not? need physically distance moment higher acceptable chance severe illness death. everyone‚Äôs vaccinated might get virus it‚Äôll large extent different flu even GQP talks getting rid it.

[Why get rid gut least Canada‚Äôs healthcare system doesnt fuck diabetics Yeah speaking Canadian friend. pretty devastated lack vaccine progress there. 

And top off, lockdows really really restrictive. bad news stars aligning [young] people stop giving fuck: cases dropping, vaccines given, winter ending/longer days, hitting one-year mark (which I'd argue big psychological impact). honestly, blame people everything right better part year enough. Unfortunately fact remains however much want focus positive technically quite woods yet; gonna interesting see stand early summer. hold breath that. joined local Facebook group basically people 65 sharing intel get vaccine asap (e.g. getting remaining doses end day priority folks got theirs). There's literally thousands people group. second vaccine becomes availible, there's 30 people lining up. cutthroat.

I would say demand extremely high right now. good news basically 70 older know least gotten first dose. drugs ‚Äúspoon feed‚Äù disclaimers? Shouldn‚Äôt people research too? Yes, study India.  also *isn't selfish*, long continuing careful get sick/infect others. Unless I'm much mistaken, covishield vaccine quote Oxford/AZ (ChAdOx1) reason we're ""behind"" native manufacturing capabilities Canada, EU purchase plan. countries ahead us fall buckets far worse covid rates do. know want done ASAP, we're best position could right given limitations, ""fairness"" nothing it. screwed countries vaccine developers. 

These confidently incorrect statements dangerously spread misinformation need stop. Why? made rule? sacred dogma decrees one must separate health decisions facets life? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Get vaccine don‚Äôt, one force you, prepared face consequences decision. means can‚Äôt go restaurant concert without showing proof vaccinated, need weigh pros cons decision, like decide to, business organization decide serve don‚Äôt.  guess comes balance excess mortality inconvenience comfortable with. always pandemic hated staying home 

Our bodies probably need time adjust slowly 

Good luck Novavax supposedly testing crossover trial think April May US. Supposedly third shot include booster new variants bother, everything EU's fault sub... indoors, close proximity, high exposure people, possibly lowest risk? I'd still choose Canadian healthcare every time. Vaccines usually take years test, develop, typically takes long time enough study participants infected efficacy determined. gobal pandemic, especially one public policy jurisdictions almost encouraging infection spread, able meet statistical requirements much quickly. Long term side effects vaccines considered show several months, years, we've passed bar already. expert told us early last year masks don‚Äôt work. believe? Masks won‚Äôt work double mask 2022? üòÇ indian AZ, worse? Colds don‚Äôt kill 500,000 people starters. 

That‚Äôs like excusing 50 plane crashes day saying ‚Äúyeah 99% land safely.‚Äù comes numbers big, 99% isn‚Äôt anywhere close good enough. 

If 50 planes started going every single day, something tells wouldn‚Äôt dare fly. I'm exciting rn! (Spain) headmaster college told us workers going start vaccinating education workers, TOMORROW, know maybe US people sound much deal, extremely good news, people starting pesimistic, seems governments finally taking seriously injecting fast doses get. bottleneck going amount doses receive.

And Spain people pro vaccines, think going problems demands vaccines all.

Certainly, think probably passed worst, think may ready summer. government initial promise, Pfizier AstraZeneca issues Europe deliveries made people pesimistic, bu feel like still chance.

I can't wait see news Israel USA faster vaccinated countries returning normalcy (the real one, creepy distopian ""new"" one) think country reach point soon well!

Good day here. Hope appearing. Correct would also argue vaccine used. definition moderate though two plus symptoms almost everyone actually pretty close definitions turns point throughout 10 minute video Dr. Fauci explain ‚Äúwhy might wearing masks 2022.‚Äù

I‚Äôll save time. said ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want make predictions. lot things possible, doesn‚Äôt mean happen. CNN editorializing views. Interesting...  Agreed! People say selfish wanting wait apparently long covid feeling safe count reasons choosy. villain world? avoid becoming permanent, need spell condition lift start. went this, told stop us overrunning hospitals. Well, we're almost there. it?  would case Trump still charge. Sputnik 5 92% rate tho, really good. I'd wait months get Sputnik AZ, since I'm isolation anyways. side science entire time. I‚Äôve listened, read articles, etc. makes feel like messaging wrong. Saying saying time vaccines 95% effective contradicting other, no? say encourage people get vaccinated confidence? vaccines, even one-shot ones keeping people developing severe symptoms - that‚Äôs HUGE news!

Are trying eradicate suppress point contact trace? Thank god. absolutely huge news. insist calling denier, agree amplify too.

Clearly positions nuance point. There's point say, ""nope, gonna save 500k lives.""

And that's point. Many us already hit it. hit point year privileged touch. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Canada? Shit, American's wont even able get dose April. Canada much farther behind, too. June seems optimistic y'all. I‚Äôm old enough remember Fauci said masks don‚Äôt work üòÇ That's Trudeau care ppl country...he rich boy, drama teaching, liar. total selfish loser. Yes. attitude wearing maks sick covid people got upset wear masks. people grew normal thing big fight them.

Most people probably would home already too. expert giving PoV better alternative? questions getting asked discussed regardless Fauci says, I'd much rather hear views experts.

Unrealistic say people wait &amp; see... creates void disinformation fill. percentage positive consider okay eat restaurant? 

Our county .7% positive I‚Äôm happy see. wondering people make calls like these. makes sense. model 3M pulled, 9210 believe, one ‚Äúduckbill‚Äù style ones know may require different materials round dust mask styled ones. welcome dislike guy day long disagree says, calling loser pretty ridiculous. He's one cited immunology researchers time. 9th 2.5 million researchers since 1980, giant field quite literally ""wrote book"" infectious disease (well, co-wrote, get idea). Lol general statement. Shut down? everything? talking shut downs happened last March/April (which weren‚Äôt even complete shut downs), no, won‚Äôt going back unless virus mutates substantially deadly disease. Hahaahhaah yeh ok. I've virus - nothing mild winter's cold - hardly worth bother.

No I'll going anywhere near vax - earth would I? Yeah, I'm locked returning UK work unless pay 1.5k hotel quarantine (even though could quarantine home pay rent for, free), fly back home dad died covid December.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'll one people waiting mRNA vaccine (or novavax approved), getting J&amp;J vaccine someone else dose that. Ah makes lot sense see read way, thanks. Yeah money get save mouthwash! like windfall ! Covid thing H1N1? it‚Äôs same? can‚Äôt keep track.

I don‚Äôt know insanity referencing second part. ‚ÄúYou want wash hands!!??? Next you‚Äôll want cut offf...‚Äù - insert insane straw man.

Covid killed 40x H1N1 has, yes? Well Dengue fever vax proved toxic made yet fever LIKELY get disease!
Currently people allowed Dengue Fever vax already disease. show ID prove age based saying. blog post specifically? Bullshit. 

The one group followed scientists whole time said. group said shoot bleach. think media needs stop treating like politician. He's giving advice mindset virus needs eliminated thoroughly smallpox. doesn't. year ago ""two weeks flatten curve."" 99.5% survival rate. need treat something apocalyptic, he's essentially operating mindset every person Earth needs operating mindset we're total war here.

The goal needs reducing spread point return fully normal life without overwhelming hospitals. okay people getting sick. People getting sick long people people. Eliminating virus stupid goal treated such. Biden power know potential side-effects *lot things* long-term, heck know potential side-effects COVID-19 long-term. use new plastics materials time could dangerous know, data. frankly engineering vaccines simple enough side effects vaccines really can't worse disease nature, data shows remarkable enough immediate results risk 100% worthwhile.

And someone want risk COVID-19 vaccine, effective solution self-isolate, society cater antivax worry warts.  non-bold glass wearing dude, feel protected xD Well, vaccines usually developed 10+ years, allowing time find side effects fix them. less one, there's way we'd find them. cutting line come from? We're prioritizing undocumented residents. I'm simply favor administering vaccine according eligibility criteria, based age, occupation, health status.

In sense I'm kind okay limiting residents state (including undocumented immigrants, excluding tourists). might completely okay residents Nevada coming California get vaccinated, let alone Mexico. really major problem, important thing currently efficiently vaccinating everyone quickly possible, verifying bunch documentation wrong way that. fellow 29 year old understand sentiment, what's important gets vaccinated order everyone get vaccinated, period. going get better herd immunity. getting vaccinated gonna bring job life back, know? intent behind prioritization really reduce death spread vulnerable populations, think kind ""good enough"" mentality important - couple people qualify get shot month early, that's better slowing process 100 people get shots month later would otherwise beauracracy. entirely either/or situation, course - I'd frustrated vaccination process entirely dominated rich people state whatever - bothered certain inevitable amount corruption. I'm partial work home like lot. can't imagine never going back office though. really like seeing people week aside cats.

I'de love keep 9-12 home hours though. nice rush awake.  Glasses wearers 100% likely foggy glasses wearing masks too.  Trade offs baby! believe check immigration status check ID verify age. 

I'm 65+ yet there's that. get vax care spreading it, feel free last get vax get downvoted it. Chapo check I'm US. want US vaccinated soon possible. saying think US may done things get doses faster compared others... Nothing wrong involve probably reallocation doses intended one place another. additionally seems like getting doses Pfizer compared EU government taken away lives. small group people break rules deem whole strategy ineffective seriously relies 100% compliance never work. Scapegoating. Allowing illegal immigrants live here/work permanently vaccinated one thing. Obviously vaccinating groups lower transmission. makes sense. 

It‚Äôs entirely different matter FLY people country (which course poses risks us) specifically get vaccinated, leave go home. That‚Äôs insane. India country. I've seen figures compare countries early widespread use HCQ countries West thing. West worst figures. want lives back Well weird fuck. Good, it‚Äôs year this. others feel unsafe stay home indefinitely. Others don‚Äôt luxury staying home 24/7 need earn living. comment pandemic:

‚ÄúThe real fact that's going bake noodle threats like covid existed entire time alive much longer.

The major difference social media intense focus it. Covid's impact mortality looking Sweden US, puts us back 2004 levels risk death.‚Äù

You denier. You‚Äôre exactly talking about. pay parking lot. fills capacity, creating blocks-long lines. one pay? mean i‚Äôm sure complaining able get seems clear don‚Äôt check IDs. walk get vaccinated it‚Äôs easy? think festivals back normal time next year. think international travel mostly back normal. probably additional documentation required show vaccinated though countries may still [travel I'm hoping make trips cancelled since March 2020. ""Hogging everyone's doses""?? Wtf even mean? US signed contracts vaccine suppliers, countries did. Several countries including UK vaccinated even citizens per capita US has.

Plus EU glaringly screwed pooch vaccine rollout. absolutely nothing whatsoever US. FFS, Chile Morocco vaccinated greater share people EU has.

Is reflexive anti-US grandstanding what? There's absolutely factual basis statement. someone fully vaccinated 2 weeks now, feel like lol weird feeling truly know act sometimes still one know 85 outside care homes health professional it. never hear disclaimers read like drugs could wearing glasses protects people's expelled breath getting eyes. That's called coercion - vaccinate get life back - consent. problem unvaccinated people among society people want vaccines protected, unconcerned whether unvaccinated people catch covid?   Unfortunately Canada's smugness never really based reality, expect change now. I'm...so lonely.   even looked data thing children? I'm guessing haven't. nothing goes wrong then, far, nothing went right. Meanwhile populist southern europe 88yo grandma still received nothing. Fuck populism leftism, hopefully new government able work better. Hey‚Äîoo!  CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash ‚ÄúState Union‚Äù whether thinks Americans still need wear masks next year, Fauci, nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert, replied: ‚ÄúYou know, think possible that‚Äôs case and, again, really depends mean normality.‚Äù could strategic part well~ under-promise, over-deliver seems approach Biden team taking lot things. says masks 2022 need anymore summer announced huge victory, etc. Nobody ever gets pissed someone exceeds expectations, all. Thank you! like people can't even consider know. I'll wait know consider vaccination. least get called lack proof aren‚Äôt backed pseudoscience bs. Compared baseline? Young people already cracking pandemic. There's literally entire website dedicated them. Palestine declined vaccines Israel favour buying nations like Russia UAE. Nonetheless, Israel announced would vaccine 125,000 Palestinian labourers send vaccines. Palestinian govt refused answer whether Israel offered them. herd immunity pipe dream. 90-95% u.s never gonna become immune thru vaccines natural infections. Source? personally, vaccinated, no. double mask data shows doubles protection brings 90%. care locality requires it. state local governments let mask mandates run entirely. Nothing required. government tells to. people see normalized. Social media reaction statements like make really dislike humanity. Fauci said ""In 2022 people still stay home they're sick rather go work large gatherings"", feel like we'd still see ton ""F-u Fauci"" posts Twitter. So, Tuesday. unlikely event. provided strong causal explanation, relying theoretical framework. Combined control variables, provides strong causal argument. prove it? Maybe not. want resist reducing well conducted studies oft repeated ""correlation causation."" phrase dismissive, lumps together studies, even ones employ solid methodology. Precovid death averages entire population... flaw lies assumption died COVID representative entire population. Good. Hope happens US soon. There‚Äôs always ‚Äòshould‚Äô ‚Äòmay‚Äô ‚Äòprobably‚Äô


I realize it‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs nature beast, gets annoying while. real issue idiot reporters asking guy predict future. CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash ‚ÄúState Union‚Äù whether thinks Americans still need wear masks next year, Fauci, nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert, replied: ‚ÄúYou know, think possible that‚Äôs case and, again, really depends mean normality.‚Äù



From another article headline know get lasting immunity infection, likely get infected long time milder, know. I'm saying get vaccine infected, pointing natural immunity indeed effective. dare people ask questions! That‚Äôs fantastic idea, let‚Äôs fly people world use vaccine doses.  ‚Äúthis gave government unprecedented powers combat something quite frankly, highly survivable cold 99% population...‚Äù

A response thread. become 5g transmitter. Beside that, fine. Canadian jealous know help us long run. quicker US vaccinates population, faster vaccines come us well many problem stating covid victims ""would died soon regardless covid"" guess that's even stevens something Poor Canada. land-mass large, population small comparison, constantly get statistical version small dick jokes. Could people don‚Äôt talk glasses wearers much. cases dramatically decline restrictions remain place, inevitable point sum mental health harm greater sum infectious disease harm. Deaths around 40% since Valentine's Day. think point lot closer people subreddit willing admit, may passed already.

I'm increasingly sympathizing states lifted restrictions find supporting people public health measures altogether. promised clear paths vaccine got here. Almost 50,000,000 people gotten vaccine there's path return normal. That's enough turn normal person crazy. ‚ÄúWhat India different studies done anywhere else world sense checking whether could work prophylactic medicine, whereas everywhere else given positive patients treatment option. results look like favourable population,‚Äù ICMR official told national daily Hindustan Times.   


We really know enough certain one specific behaviour responsible much less spread absolutely nobody followed norms social distancing masks(because many could not, possible 4.5 people average one household). say acting locking entire cities even there's slight spike cases, maybe that. well theres reason double mask lol, there's locality world would suddenly require that.   Um health care still widely better USAs. I'm sure Canada fine. flaws??? üòéüòé Even argument bit mute. could well vaccine production facilities- correct type current vaccines. We‚Äôd basically state art production facilities every single type vaccine production ensure we‚Äôd safe - seems pretty unrealistic.

People upset something pretty remarkable- we‚Äôre going vaccinated within year half outbreak.   seen many HPV. disclaimers. someone else explained rational way understand reason why. Yeah, feel terrible folks. I'm 30 pretty fucking awful (for lot different reasons)... imagine forfeiting college experience half country uses scapegoat spread Covid  Restaurants public recreational facilities necessities life, harm, foul, people chose forgo vaccinations, thus also public facilities. tho sound like jerks, I‚Äôm sure represents entire country though. took pleasure seeing happening US Ireland we've vaccinated....66 people Where? Yeah wish could let's wait

S/ Nobody's forcing get vaccines. like nobody's forced interact business people get vaccines. That's that's happening here. rights antivaxx people also rights forced engage them. fact one make claim save you. FDA previously stated multiple companies masks used pandemic known antiviral antimicrobial properties features fall umbrella EUA. worked multiple antiviral antimicrobial products pandemic exact situation.

Just FYI, one calls self sterilizing actually worse (from FDA's viewpoint).   There's going adjustment period. first time crowd folks concert maskless going probably feel strangely odd. smoking? mean carrot advice exactly? Sorry familiar term. Like advice vaccinated people return normal activity? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è far know yes. makes sense, thanks. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre listening random person Reddit safety parents. 

They completely talking ass. one study hasn‚Äôt even peer reviewed yet data controversial. even 100% true, viral shedding reduced, eradicated, means viral shedding still happens still risk transmission. 

It‚Äôs whether wanna personally take risk not, person telling it‚Äôs safe bullshit. greatest vaccine distributions world without kind headstart previous administration

No, would say good job. :) Canadian vaccines coming EU production sites? EU vaccination levels pretty similar right maybe week ahead, makes sense given ship across atlantic first. must bot  I‚Äôll fifteen couple weeks. hobbies require people (Band, Filmmaking, Scouts), it‚Äôs rough year.

Meanwhile mother told today ‚ÄúThis staying home thing fun, don‚Äôt want going this. You‚Äôve fine‚Äù they're required FDA advertise TV. 

Have seen TV advertisements COVID-19 vaccines? Yup. definitely aged like milk. Although assumed good humoured nature post clearly evident. Cool. still don‚Äôt get original comment trying suggest young people‚Äôs current mental health struggles nothing abnormal ‚Äúalready cracking‚Äù It‚Äôs mostly private business. Walmart example keeps requiring year still wear one go in. Universal healthcare anything fact previous Conservative government got rid domestic vaccine manufacturing. Please educate instead believing whatever nonsense read internet  Yes, long term Slightly concerning Presumably exists variants right *less* affected vaccine (but still mostly stopped), people get infected possibility yet another variant even resilient, enough current vaccines alone halt spread. vaccinating adults going work sort booking system going call people? people like /u/MooseHorse123 post anti-Trump stuff. sure point that. vaccines exempt? Enough take care politicians families. know, would guess would want little data first see many Americans get vaccinated Q1 start dragging concern Americans dishonest, would end back political-scuffle possibly make things worse result accusatory lacking trust (however accurate may be), know.

Ideally get many people vaccinated early avoid issue entirely, seem focused on.  people flaunted land-based travel bans using helicopters jump border driving RVs there. snowbirds stole vaccines Floridians! snowbirds could well brought virus variants US back again. dare show nonsense attitude like September 2020.  Um I've def heard toss definitive dates. said ""open season vaccines would April"" the. turned ""may/June"" ""by late July"". needs learn keep mouth shut answers Nope. commercials many disclaimers? Except Ohio, Idaho, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas .... person's prime lasts lot longer year two. Almost every generation deal catastrophic disruption. lucky exceptions. great depression lasted 10 years. WW2 lasted 6. ever apologize getting vaccinated. thawed short shelf life, one less carrier COVID19. Yeah, leaving LMFAO Europe morons, tyvm.

Early childhood education European Union, example, extremely high. EU-27, 94.8 % children aged four compulsory starting age primary education early childhood education Thank service helping educate unaware unrestricted capitalism cancer society. know expectations high preventing hospitalization deaths enough. Sometimes feel like people judge vaccines percentages see media think it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôre lying.

Canada America Jr. [Always ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^bot would guessed vaccine nationalism works faster vaccine rollout? stock private companies can't leave countries, others pay double lol There‚Äôs nothing wrong vaccinating countrymen first worrying nations. reading statistical analysis death toll reaches 250 thousand plus, enough everyone know someone dies. 

I thought person know would willing sacrifice freedom/income. answer one. you, answer different. Always Justin Trudeau People need start listening epidemiologists, Fauci point become political hack. even though rooted Trump administration ex president gave flak believe fame getting head Bruh went dentist Bay Area last week hygienist told literally everyone office vaccinated like January that's kinda nuts would curious see list, feels like similar countries South Central America received lot doses. Maybe I'm seeing headlines assuming that. headlines I've seen hundreds thousands thousands. NYer here. averaging &lt;1 positivity rate summer, although I‚Äôd like back, 2.99% great compared 9% four weeks ago. Yeah. clarify, begrudge anyone either additional $600 stimulus check, like Americans left starve Canadians made CERB (2k lot less Canadians gotten regular times, also seems bit unfair.) UK's 80% salary replacement furloughed workers seems superior Canadian American response IMO. suggest? promising delivering? would think last four years would show stupid strategy is. Strange want share personal medical information internet stranger called crazy? saw bunch natives fighting land thought, ""Well... just... killed... *all* them, uh... took ourselves?""

A broken peace treaties here, bullshit deals there. trail tears later land free, home brave, baby! Thank trump Operation Warp Speed Trump administration program happening lol. Soon I'm vaccinated restrictions lifted I'm done shit. 100 countries manufacturing capabilities. It‚Äôs basic logic. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Completely home run. They‚Äôre pretty much perfect vaccines. They‚Äôve opened gateway vaccines use mRNA. Honestly, care anymore. I've enough bad shit happen since pandemic started care wear masks indoor public spaces indefinitely. that's worry about, I'll moon joy. Watch link posted starting 14:00. Conservatives waged war scientists case you‚Äôve already forgotten weren‚Äôt aware begin with. Biden saved us all! good. United States foolhardy issue lead way vaccinations. Well, course not...I can‚Äôt fly anywhere right restrictions put EVERYONE protect 1%

Never much asked asked many protect based think people tired Fauci keeps tossing 3 different timelines dates weekly basis

Such what? Every single thing look suggests consistent message: ""We honestly know anything concrete - depends heavily rollout.""

For example: say get 75 percent, 80 percent population vaccinated,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúIf that, efficiently enough second quarter 2021, time get end summer, i.e., third quarter, may actually enough herd immunity protecting society get end 2021, approach much degree normality close before.‚Äù

The problem, think, people want something concrete one definitely give thing. he's forced make _some_ kind call, people get upset things end worse predicted. depends many people actually practice safe distancing continue wear masks, depends many people get vaccinated, on. Fauci consistent people continue wear masks, wash hands, distance, get vaccinated, point clearly tired repeating he's lately disingenuous dangerous

When say this, specifically referring to?  Imagine trusting CCP anything LMFAO approval UK heavily politicized. agencies concerned lack data, somehow, UK noticed even faster everyone else.

Right? tell why? Strange won‚Äôt answer. Nope would shocked Germany manages vaccinate 25% population end summer year.

I assume vaccination campaign mostly finished next spring EU. Nothing changed. number doesn‚Äôt timeline. We‚Äôve secured vaccines delivery schedule defined contract based conservative production estimates. production increased extra going places. Florida purpose everything open, patients come back second shot. Yep think totally eradicate well thanks best vaccines ever See link hard people get this? people really enjoyed lied care lie obvious lie? last 4 years tells answer that, still hard comprehend. It‚Äôs going become choice. 12% vs 3% still bad regaurdless. Unfournately none things possible venue. aren‚Äôt traditional reception venue. Worldwide? don‚Äôt know actual data is, around live know unexpected number people don‚Äôt plan getting vaccinated. high percentage people choosing vaccinate, transmission numbers may drop wear need year. ridiculous people I‚Äôve heard voice won‚Äôt getting vaccinated people vocal ‚Äúover it‚Äù ‚Äúover masks.‚Äù 
As aren‚Äôt. somehow don‚Äôt grasp concept getting past part solution. hope soon people say like Christmas cause like them...sigh im young met ex bf class cause smiled across room another --kinda fairytale like happen w masks..sigh fake news started? Canada people know received vaccinations front line workers last person know got second dose last week weeks delay ran weeks before. Canada domestic production capacity mercy production schedules Pfizer, Moderna others. imports Pfizer slashed retooled facility supplying us speed production.

I think people either know know care ""their vaccine want now"", companies operate quarterly basis, committed provide long X # vaccines quarter still track meet added capacity. Instead consistent supply, we're going whole whack doses condense time period. put us behind weeks, sure. I'm confident timeline gov't laid out..

 hope VOCs take hold meantime. hometown went lowest percapita rate Ontario 1 international traveller infect 30 others one outbreak 3 around town sorted awaiting testing. think hurts effort convince vax-hesitant people Fauci emphasizes nothing change even vaccines get here. makes people think, ‚Äúwell, getting then?‚Äù

hell yes. got vaccine honest, regret far allowed one iota freedom gotten closer normal life back. still can't travel see boyfriend family, still wear enough PPE suffocate elephant work, everything gives life meaning enjoyment still either forced shut many restrictions requirements participate even enjoyable. understand plan delay properly reopening society everyone wants vaccine recieved one, talk ""no normal even vaccines"" geuninely makes feel like would rather die. intellectually dishonest ignore 83% 36 days noting increase time. separate Israel data done US don‚Äôt think vaccine available anyone wants it, still mandates. may choose wear masks experts may saying keep wearing Christmas. settings like hospitals may still require them, average person businesses still requiring long. Merkel likes that, lockdown Easter, go Unless know bunch sick people friends 65+ year olds, see much death. Correct. Administration issue. capacity 4/5 million day....at least. supply. Except ease getting air always bias data direction conclusion. easier get airborne prevent ability get touch. New Zealand never stopped worrying virus, they‚Äôve managed keep case counts low. still need everyone New Zealand get vaccinated. Canadians smugly laughed us ridiculed us throughout 2020, sweet grandmother struggled COVID died along many others. Canadians would've used even half energy used cruelly ridiculing dying elders channeled vaccine production, Canada would enough vaccines Canada, Planet Earth, Milky Way, numerous galaxies.

And now, 2021, Canadians displaying incredibly entitled attitude, especially cruel behavior 2020. addition sense entitlement, many white Canadians flaunting white privilege, demanding vaccines expense Black Americans People Color USA dying larger rate Canadians. Damn, almost like US higher population count, joke comparison, number infected US vs Canada? even death count?? see we're much better stuff I'll leave that. studies ‚Äúsurviving‚Äù surfaces also fraught it‚Äôs mostly laboratory conditions they‚Äôve placed virus themselves. real world indications surface transmission extraordinarily rare, requires transmit virus surface respiratory tract. Food meant go nose lungs. Correct. 30 micrograms 100 mcg. side effects Moderna's booster surprising really....  I‚Äôm concerned media poor kid‚Äôs paranoid brain Compare amount people died per capita tell healthcare America better. wonder seem reporting that. even report getting doses. people covid unit LTC assisted living they're ones who've gotten 1st time lapsed. LTC assisted living aren't, is? I'm 43 wait even though sit near covid cases dialysis. right. I'm thankful wife able afford home school this. Bummed little guy didnt get start class kindergarten year, he's far advanced (working second grade material) definitely right call. You‚Äôre full shit. Nowhere website give total many vaccines administered brand/type: ""until there's enough vaccination everyone 16+"". qualifier enough you? semantics. ones US controlled distinctly government. example Pfizer took absolutely goverment money expecting contracts like commercial entity. They're US plants EU plants. Pfizer plants located US Pfizer plants located EU. Unvaccinated Canadian resident doctor here. Literally spent night emergency department last night undifferentiated neurology/stroke patients, can‚Äôt tell whether covid symptoms not, high-risk categories. exposures ‚Äúnot high enough‚Äù warrant unit getting first dose. know much control, hospital/health unit really dropped ball one. Meanwhile (now ex-) CEO found travelling USA multiple time lockdowns holidays, rumours vaccinated first batch arrived January. 

smh I‚Äôm tired Might surprising Trump actually good job focusing vaccines. seems WH approach fall rely vaccines prioritised that. something documented sides. 

It‚Äôs paying despite whatever shortcomings happened earlier, including Trump getting sick. Canadian here. situation simple. United States forced vaccine manufacturers agree distribute vaccine US priority. means get vaccine America, rather shipped us Europe. start making fun Canada might want consider culpability United States. also half million deaths Canada either... 5 people Yeahhhhhhhh... work care facility, huge risk environment, told would likely end April us, *if we're lucky.* hell downvoted? That's kind odd me. Like concerned ramping administration much, says extra 6M shots easily made 3 days, addition 1.7M avg we've already doing.

If that's true, administration issue. Quit lying yourself.

People haven‚Äôt telling pandemic isn‚Äôt they‚Äôre much fun it. They‚Äôve telling it‚Äôs truth. guess hinges &lt;age 18 trial outcomes. work (I think one mfr vaccine age 12+ least trial speak) would make sense race vaccinate soon good results out. way handling kid asking advice pretty fucking disgraceful tbh know right? 3% false positive rate PCR test. Heck HIV‚Äôs PCR test false positive rate 5%. everyone wearing masks? It‚Äôs easiest precaution COVID. plan wear masks grocery stores public transportation out. Canadian absolutely agree.

But back mind I'm thinking fair countries selfish politicised whole thing deserve first? mean reward child bad behaviour.. 

But that's ok I'll continue wait patiently. Wait keep hearing masks Christmas im confused (I dont want though :'( ) case, reddit karma  know share, we‚Äôd never hear end ‚Äúwhy America shit job vaccinating people?! pandemic basically Canada it‚Äôs still control America!‚Äù Aww euros cute sometimes Nobody delighted pure psychopaths short term thinking idiots.

USA failing handle virus meant world would need locked longer. Otherwise, virus sneaks spreads globe. Simple that. good anyone. many faulty assumptions post above.

First, they‚Äôre taking highest possible estimate infections. assume IFR .4 .5%, given 9590 deaths, puts ~39% ~49% population infected. It‚Äôs reasonable split difference 44%, although would also safe assume Alabama‚Äôs IFR higher obesity health issues state. 

Secondly, they‚Äôre assuming zero overlap people contracted covid people gotten vaccinated, definitely true.

Also, assuming immunity begins 2 weeks second dose, around ~2% Alabama‚Äôs population vaccinated twice 2 weeks ago. 

Even assume immunity begins two weeks first dose, 5-6% gotten first dose 2 weeks ago.

Alabama almost certainly achieved herd immunity yet. states public health department said pre existing conditions don‚Äôt need vaccinated yet they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter equipped stay home longer‚Äù. can‚Äôt get rude shameful perspective is. 100% correct. Thanks sharing! Things definitely behind expected based personal network. another example anecdotal evidence flawed. Thank work do. literally care

This well known. Yeah I‚Äôm vaccinated people area I‚Äôm giant bonfire masks Lol who's asking american assistance What's covid infection situation Canada compared United States? Throughout pandemic Canada roughly one third infection rate per capita US had. Ask percent US population needs vaccinated infection rate per capita drops Canada's. Grocery:

If dry objects, keep couple days use like normal.

If containers touch use them, I'll wipe soap water put fridge.

Make food like normal, wash hands making wash hands eating it.

Nothing that. ""then much changed""... True, would give credence notion masks implementation social distancing anything virus driven seasonality (if restrictions maintained summer). case, would insane keep trying things again. Either let rip, lock put infrastructure place real contact tracing rapid, omnipresent testing. taxes dollars used develop vaccine instead helping people, company reaps profits. temporary suspension intellectual property laws vaccine pandemic wouldn‚Äôt hinder innovation, opinion. seems main argument hoarding IP rather giving companies means produce vaccines. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ....I've lost weight. I'm fan Trudeau. Pfizer one dropped ball. Trudeau stood around looking dumbfounded instead catching it. We're vaccinating rate fast enough we'll able mass gatherings summer masks, social distancing, testing, vaccine ID requirements. lots states trying play way conservatively. nice demonstration government always drag feet comes giving power. Dude, stop repeating yourself. Go back read damn comment, literally mention middle Canada hadn‚Äôt helped them. Stop telling didn‚Äôt say something that‚Äôs black white. Happy cake day.

To specific / add more. think ever facility make mRNA vaccine. first ones ever made believe require different manufacturing facility. National Research Council making facility even believe intended make mRNA vaccines. 

Our industry vaccines greatest. signed deals pharma companies tried get manufacture Canada well. refused. assume part enough support industry. would silly setup facility Canada also ship every single part make vaccine. 

Side note: 

I say this, Canadian company's technology used Pfizer vaccine. envelope, lipid nano particle used deliver vaccine Canadian. I'm sure manufacturing LNPs technology manufactured pfizer would rather take 40 days slightly stricter conditions free virus.

That would 40 days now, 7 days month, another 7 days two months...

China European countries rolling lockdowns cases pop again. production facilities it. Nobody WANTS this. truly think doctors giddy continued masking angling next interview gig book deal. It‚Äôs shock value. God dudes messaging fucking worst. vaccine, you‚Äôre obligation restricted (not really first place that‚Äôs different argument). going improve quickly


Not according Pfizer Moderna ~95% efficacy preventing symptoms, stopping infection entirely. AZ much lower, J&amp;J bit lower, Novovax higher. number came comparing two groups, vaccinated unvaccinated - 20x many unvaccinated people caught vaccinated.

Logically means combination of:

* 5% people mount good response.

* 5% viral doses sufficient overwhelm immune response. (This wearing mask still smart prevalence high interacting unvaccinated people. Viral load among vaccinated reduced 75% even people get infected.)

We know ratio two effects, money second bigger (there people, especially elderly, react worse vaccines though). Nobody vaccine trials got ""severe"" covid, efficacy seems even higher around 99%. honestly think blame leadership. easy blame' external sources think Canada one countries took seriously stuck outcome. 

Did take vaccines seriously? doubt that. multiple problems together like building biotech/pharma depending countries? Maybe negotiated poorly vaccines like EU.

I think multiple things change over. US cutting ties China self reliant manufacturing particularly strategic industries. Canada personally feel going self reliance. definitely seems like good news! said, curious see actual methodology. article sparse vaccine, rolled national immunization program began Dec. 20, 89.4% effective preventing laboratory-confirmed infections, **according copy draft publication posted Twitter confirmed person familiar work.** companies Israel‚Äôs Health Ministry worked together preliminary observational analysis, yet peer-reviewed.

The article written way makes sound like testing *pro*active (everyone studied population received regular testing based timeline). study *re*active (people seeking tests think they're sick) really much analyze issue asymptomatic spread.

I hope good sounds, need careful optimistic, euphoric. Pessimism fine like optimism, neither one fuel abandoning prudence. 

With recent good news seems like people starting act like pandemic basically over. might be, work actually end it. preemptive celebration get togethers good way make sure pandemic enters new phase.

**TL;DR** We've lot awesome, good news recently. Let's work make sure actually end. Thank you! don‚Äôt know first comment got downvotes. I‚Äôm extreme pro-lockdowner, put life pause, eat restaurants occasionally, etc. raise eyebrows aging, at-risk in-laws going vacations. I‚Äôm going stop them. actions affecting us too. majority deaths people long term care. Even 16 year statistic true, it‚Äôs awesome 16 years nursing home. Fauci trying hard hold 5 minutes fame hope right. imagine program well underway then, hopefully couple vaccines approved. hope speedy recovery North America whole world, wish neck woods pace closest allies around world. low standards. vaccinated anyone all? Given you‚Äôre one countries highest purchase vaccinations per capita, I‚Äôm surprised read commends Canada. saying US vaccinates people day Canada vaccinated total. 3 weeks past shot #1. gotta get sweet, sweet ad revenue I‚Äôd say want plan now, make plans moderate precautions, likely seating families together 6 feet apart avoiding buffet style dining. 

If things get better coming months, adjust plans. even used comparison begin absolute fucking moron. Thank you! don‚Äôt know comment got downvotes. I‚Äôm extreme pro-lockdowner, put life pause, eat restaurants occasionally, etc. raise eyebrows aging, at-risk in-laws going vacations. I‚Äôm going stop them. actions affecting us too. issue price, lack facilities cook food. person obviously minor. anybody expect do? show healthcare failing. limited amount vaccines, Canada dosent make america does? expect Trudeau make deal USA give Canadians vaccines Americans? Yeah, I‚Äôm happy it. doubt that‚Äôs whole reason, even Canada getting equal supply US, would face ethical issue countries parts world far smaller less economically significant US Canada. probably won‚Äôt see significant vaccine distribution another year, US, Canada, China, etc., fill. 

Someone always lower list definitely sucks. People forget like ""holiday surge"" prophesized midwest cases peaked week Thanksgiving. not. literally saying, Canadians expect help? help us before. complaining it, countering people complaining first. 

I really give fuck Canada before. said comment (if bothered read it) one owed anyone anything. literally care. OP countering narrative unfair help.

I wrote ""essay"" (your reply pretty long too!) becaude completely missed point OPs comment. still are.  take guess. population. 40 million people Canada 10 times US big companies better invest US. big factors like lower taxes, less regulation etc. makes overall much bigger sense invest US. Also thing taken mind private companies producing vaccine countries. drive 1.5 hours worth Maybe Canada could approve AstraZeneca? That‚Äôs using UK it‚Äôs part they‚Äôre going fast. ‚Äúuntil everyone vaccinated‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure realize NEVER happen due vax resistance populations outside control. would consider ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù? everyone wants vax opportunity? tricky know. 

Just trying feel various benchmarks we‚Äôre going fight later are. He‚Äôs using stick get people get level infection keep down. Agreed - shows people base actions fear irrationality science data. Sorry even it‚Äôs problem. rather USA vaccinate 20 year old grocery worker 80 year old Canadian. 75 != 92 That's said some.

""You're kid worried"" even coming close answering question. dismissal. explained shitty situation find in, people started setting need something parents' weird rules, that's remote possibility minor controlling home. Since administration capacity greater supply capacity thus far, delayed doses *should* able administered week, ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù fairly quickly. ""Like jetlag hangover"" 
I said myself. day actually get things done next day tired beyond reasonable measure. brain fog. Holy hell, feel like I'm losing mind multiple times day...
And sudden inability breathe moments. Scary stuff. $$$$$$ Honestly I've thinking lab whole time. think China's Chernobyl everything cover up.

To clear, think genetically engeneered intentionally leaked lab there, China's reaction WHO, misinformation campaign really raises red flags. really, preliminary data showed vaccines reduced severity COVID-19, much vaccines reduced transmission unknown. meme sub 2.8% Canadians vaccinated vs. 12.4% Americans... yeah larger population would result higher number infected / dead. sure you‚Äôre getting buddy Yeah mean leadership leadership. mean blame Biden issues blame Trump. causes problems country later yes think that's fair game blame US leadership issue.

I think personally American knew would happen way early 2020 vaccine projects first announced. distinct fear US would watching citizens countries line take vaccine would watching home economy would unable reopen. Back think everyone US imagined people TV getting vaccines first would China. think US government spent insane amount money make sure happen us. mean insane. look list price mRNA vaccines we're paying like $50 per dose EU price list like $10 per dose. end know what. paid got it. mean sense word. paid high price got it. exceptional thread evidence transmission food people talking still wipe groceries, re-heat takeout food, etc., despite evidence necessary. pandemic mental illness. Car accidents nothing. I‚Äôm talking smoking, fast food, sugar, red meat. aren‚Äôt freaking fuck things kill FAR people covid could ever dream killing. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù complete lack perspective fucking society nothing. I‚Äôm even talking wearing masks, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm talking closing schools, depression, anxiety, media freak outs, etc. covid bad? course. bad it‚Äôs made media government officials? Nope. Trudeau cared people! Blood hands! 

That's arguments work, right? hearing last 4 years didn‚Äôt realize pro-USA, anti-Canada stories allowed Reddit Im thinking playing safe they're not. Think this. Belgium second worst world deaths per capita. US 8th. Canada's biggest COVID vaccine supplier Belgium. 

The US direct interest helping Canada. Canadians enter US nationality. US Canadian economies inextricably linked. Thousands trucks, workers, tourists go back forth two countries every day (pre-border closure, obviously). 

There little interest Belgium care Canada respect COVID. close allies, nowhere near close US. There's justification US refusing sell us vaccines. interest, moral responsibility close allies. mention governments response extreme weather events. People dieing freezing death homes. details disagree dont really care I‚Äôm confident things start ramp up.

Yes, soon US getting preferred treatment companies anymore. Yes, highly effective vaccines available everyone wants them, Florida among open even pandemic. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll restricting anything year‚Äôs end.

I live caretaker elderly grandparents COPD, one em emphysema oxygen. Anybody tells worry kiss ass, quite honest. Thank much, really helpful. vaccinated, pot-luck says might either/both 5%s still worth pretty careful?

Btw, I‚Äôm obviously working basis even I‚Äôm vaccinated still carry trasmit virus others continue wearing mask social distancing/following guidance avoid infecting others. comments helped understand nature continued risk me; thank you. 

Do know trials looked reduction long covid cases? I‚Äôm presuming lot research yet it‚Äôs mathematically kinda like seconary-linked effect infection (=harder assess link) priority right reduce acute infections death. acute infections drop think understanding impact long covid rates useful, it‚Äôs dessimating many younger lives. 

Thanks again. good hear! Yeah mean it‚Äôs always hard compare countries. think Israel 2 disadvantages 1) densely populated people generally living top apartment blocks 2) larger groups completely flout lockdown rules, like religious orthodox. 

Also, think another factor U.K. height battling new mutation January insanely high case rate early January. new mutation reached Israel later started fighting contagious mutation end Jan/early Feb, numbers February compared January don‚Äôt look good. do...they really do. know people love basking people's misery they're miserable themselves. kids like fact cheat tests get straight A's..some people like ""annoying"" people lives can't travel ""show off"" wealth..they really bitter people world pandemic brought worst them. Pfizer decided send vaccine Canada weeks agreeing to. Canada got fucked drug companies. I'm saying worry Covid parents weird thermometer. Like literally minor illness worried about. irrelevant point. come point time virtually everyone US vaccinated near future. According data (ie article), risk spreading virus dramatically reduced vaccinated. chance contracting virus serious symptoms virtually nothing vaccinated (and rest population too).

Even point, guarantee ton people sub still wearing masks. science data suggests necessary, irrationally afraid, live world fear sensationalism. first half, gonna lie Fair point. ofc getting inoculated gives privilege lifestyles recall yet foregone conclusion. days ago, number estimated validated signatures somewhere around 50% what's needed. still 3 weeks 3 days lag verifying due covid, see. recall petition judicially granted double time collect signatures. 

I checked Fivethirtyeight seem lean toward 'it happen' camp, high confidence interval. whole thing clearly rattled Newsom's cage, map regarding positions policies related COVID. Drove two hours Pfizer, 3 weeks second shot. Totally worth. Dr. Drew comment Oh good, hope vaccines get Canada fast! I‚Äôm United States near Canadian border. It‚Äôs like United States safe Canada vaccinated kids still can't vaccine, bet ass still mask orders. parent, 'mask shaming' turned 110%. makes asshole, I'm asshole. ONE child death many. responses saw seem pretty reasonable. way concerned be, people trying reassure him. US resident assure vaccine definitely readily available, even people priority categories. demand far outstrips supply right now. Wow amazing. Canada might get year end would help vaccines. can't believe we're sitting huge stockpile nobody bothered roll out. report Pfizer someone reneging shipment agreement? Germany actually pretty good innovation. rest it? much bad vaccine exceptional Pfizer Moderna. still, decently protective corona, cheaper easier logically distribute. Ppl ‚Äúlike‚Äù masks??  don‚Äôt mind all; certainly enough dick someone wants wear one. ‚Äúliking‚Äù masks?? sounds insane. might right. US death rate 3x Canada US year behind financial support individual citizens, suppose that's correct. *""On balance"".* Even next school season needs start bit later (like October instead August/September), would worth making sure kids entering vaccinated. well sure, maybe ban food No, you‚Äôre spot on. next one won‚Äôt lucky (if call half million people dead lucky). next one won‚Äôt able recover from. accuracy. shut down; sold private corporations.

Sanofi, owns Connaught Labs, whole lot nothing comes producing COVID vaccines, could probably produce either Novavax J&amp;J Canadian soil. inlaws (who haven‚Äôt seen grandchildren year refuse wear masks around us) üôÑ Kind funny shit Europe considering contribution vaccine development. first vaccine used US came Germany ... Thats great. horrible. Guess depends side border talking Italy 55 years Clear exactly? We've demanded lot sacrifice grandma die alhzeimers 92 instead COVID 91. sure run postmortem going look like lockdowns school closures good idea. drive 7 hours. Midwest va giving shots extra vaccines. took spent night got vaccine drove 7 hours back Yeah I‚Äôm page. I‚Äôve read &lt; 12 vaccines likely come later fall. summer argument like:

‚ÄúVax supply overtaken demand; anyone wants vax get one. I‚Äôm taking fucking mask off.‚Äù

‚ÄòBut children?? daughter can‚Äôt get vax she‚Äôs 7!‚Äô

‚ÄúHer risk low, idgaf!‚Äù

‚ÄòNo it‚Äôs not; dare you!‚Äô yeah taxes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That‚Äôs thought.

3 million per day doable early-mid March. True. shame companies like CNN responsible enough handle scientific topics.  
 
""Nevermind anything happening right now, forced wear masks 2022!?"" 
""Well bit pointless speculate far ahead. guess can't rule out"" 
""GOTTEM! Fire clickbait headlines! MASKS 2022 CONFIRMED!"" explain Canada receiving doses EU plants plants next-door neighbours country? Maybe get it, maybe we're given half-truths here. Wait, didn‚Äôt (the USA) get blasted brothers north mis handling Covid-19? Well deservedly shit bed beginning get act together mildly successful. Go Us! Well, Germany didn‚Äôt really true lockdown. light restrictions, true lockdown like countries have. Wonder numbers go mutation. don‚Äôt think Americans gonna settle J&amp;J vaccine, would arguably discrimination give one group j&amp;j another Moderna/pfeizer. think j&amp;j vaccine exactly Biden admin shipping world humanitarian relief, important eradicating virus. Pfizer Biontech superior vaccine one favor here. Pfizer Belgium retooled Factory able pump large amounts vaccine. way. like million doses missing? know meant harm phrasing, ""it's behavioral management"" awfully glib dealing millions upon millions Americans suffering beyond comprehension.

If vaccines truly off-ramp, NEED SAY SO!! Then, *simultaneously*, stress need caution vaccines widespread point anyone wants vaccine access one. 

As far people giving safety guidelines early: really significant amount Americans either *already* given safety guidelines, (on extreme) dragged houses ends? guess see there's critical mass people waiting chance fake vaccination status.

(Again, none jumping case -- post happened trigger thoughts come spewing out.) 47% Israel vs. 25% UK received least one dose, current cases \~40% January peak Israel, \~20% January peak UK. UK much better position Israel make much sense. Vaccine acceptance unknown variable here, cant say anything sure, yet. people take vaccine, we're good. acceptance wanes numbers continue decrease going spring summer, leave open another potential, albeit smaller, wave fall along flu season (which curb stomped year due COVID mitigation efforts)

Things looking brighter. Fauci even said things continue get better months go on. need hope vaccine acceptance high. Thanks, yeah, that‚Äôs really. There‚Äôs 10 times people U.S lmfaoo shitty headline wearing mask starts killing people people won‚Äôt care. want pretend it‚Äôs over. Bay Area, also drive 40 minutes that‚Äôs moron driving like moron (pretty typical) caused accident turned 15 minute drive 40 min drive That‚Äôs possible. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs hard data either way, reasoning behind saying close borders speculation reservoir disease continuously seeding vaccinated population lead increased breakthrough infections increased likelyhood vaccine resistant mutations. Yeah i
I'm depressed, defeated angry *situation* I'm mad U.S. situation. hate knowing I'm like 6-8 months vaccine (I'm disabled essentual worker important vaccinate) I've isolated humans since March 2019 per capita infection rate US roughly three times Canada. Yeah hate dichotomy urge cognizantly keep hands clean, worry food someone else prepared groceries put pantry. folks made determination schools spread viruses. Okay hope - want go school see smiling faces - hate lack facial expressions - cant tell eyes sometimes. Yes, it‚Äôs looking like companies starting kids trials, awesome. would imagine they‚Äôll go well. Hopefully it‚Äôs much next school year get vaccines kids. That‚Äôll absolute game changer. He‚Äôs right. States like CA keep indoor mask mandates indefinitely. ambulance chaser attorneys waiting file Covid lawsuit soon store drops mask requirement. really don‚Äôt ability seat households six feet apart venue. We‚Äôd likely cut guest list cancel. Yeah, sob stories ambulances wait hours doctors close basically entire hospitals Covid-19 annectodal. I'm tired media propaganda quality care starts drop drastically need drastic measures. blame current leadership. We're building multiple vaccine plants around country. started last summer, ready production end year. blame leadership past sure. Letting manufacturing jobs go overseas. age vote leaders though, nothing could changed. 

I know anyone 'blame' right second. whole thing sucks. Canada second line different vaccine shipments world. States first line. Money talks, nothing could there. It‚Äôs countries getting populations vaccinated ASAP. It‚Äôs political scientific friend load entitled crap. Canada vaccines United States ship Canada. bought vaccines come Europe US coming through. way, even vaccinated half population would still higher covid rate Canada without vaccines. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm ready raw dog world again. God bless America fact know stored little frightening tbh. Even rudimentary trial error would told that. entirely supply issue. Ontario doubled vaccination rates couple days supplies increased. I‚Äôm sure could multiplying even supply. Canada secured many doses early schedule reasonable time seems increases supply gone elsewhere. part vaccine nationalism. Countries prioritizing domestic supply Canada doesn‚Äôt domestic supply. It‚Äôs disappointing I‚Äôm sure Canada sort term.  makes feel better, majority Canadians understand ""sharing"" yet blame you. So, symptoms aren‚Äôt gone. Long term effects well documented scary part COVID. could lung damage, heart damage, etc. talk Doctor. White House press secretary already said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting prediction business‚Äù. Apparently Fauci didn‚Äôt get memo. actually think U.S. share higher fraction vaccines, vaccine allocation worldwide based need/saving largest number total lives.

But people see complaining Canadians/Europeans want vaccine access themselves. standard, we've already vaccinated enough people U.S. Europe would much efficient ethical use overall resources export vaccines right now, giving countries vulnerable vaccinated all. arguing that. want yourself. 2023 next week. crazy arguably two countries performed worst entire Pandemic somehow managed absolutely nail vaccination rollout.

From UK perspective NHS thousands volunteers. Wow, previously expecting 2035. y'all! Ah right, incredibly sound argument. think it, never let murder become big deal legally speaking... us (billions) going die anyway, point prosecuting killers. People fucking die. Canada ranks 45th countries vaccination, dead last G7 countries. think keep we‚Äôre doing, keep vaccine‚Äôs rolling, would returning normal summer. unknowns variants people refuses/can‚Äôt vaccinate. gloryholes doggystyle useful think people hard Fauci - previous admin handled whole thing poorly made situation harder everyone needed be. Biden's president literally month.

Now people expecting Fauci oracle time still significant fraction people nation believe virus think mask-wearing unamerican trampling freedoms... becomes really hard factor kind effect comes predictions normally issue. 

If Fauci says ""we'll maskless end year virus issue,"" he's going get blasted overly optimistic blasted he's even little bit. says ""we'll still wearing masks,"" people get angry anyway. He's lose-lose situation here.

All _can_ really say things improve, safe bet. I‚Äôm concerned censorship Fauci absolutely say this. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think start seeing restrictions loosen early summer.

What? would take long lol. whole original point lockdowns protect elderly vulnerable overwhelm hopsitals. end March elderly risk either vaccinated ability get vaccinated. point removing mandates rest population choice go get vaccinated not. That's it. Many would say restrictions supersoft, yes. still given good reason why. suprised point im used bad news. Periodically Fauci comes house sees shadow 6 weeks masks.  Uh oh guess that's good pronounced response. go well politically really think give Canada 5 million vaccines. Helping helping us too. live Florida usually get many Canadian tourists.

Besides, maybe one day need help too? I‚Äôm perfectly comfortable sending vaccines outside US. 

Canada lot opportunities invest vaccines like US chose invest CanSino instead Moderna J&amp;J etc. bad blood Canada China, idea would invest joint venture China mind blowing. 

The US needs take care it‚Äôs citizens first. majority safe I‚Äôm sure Biden start shipping vaccines around world. would stupid give vaccines rest world literally laughing us things worst, including Canada. Stop ignoring viral dose. Right go store take sample chicken breast, squash, beans, broccoli, peppers expensive Swanson frozen dinner bag chips. Likely every single store every day week.

I'm saying strategic purchases beat stats sampled controlled random manner. Chicken breast usually 3.99 lb. I've never life purchased chicken breast price. refuse. There's always another protein sale. eat protein freezer got sale. That's keep providing specific examples. fully accept every store every single day there's average cheaper crap food. there's deals good food. gotta go buy bulk. Again, week assorted pork loin chops best deal $.99 lb. Buy shit eat rice $.99 lb broccoli. sexy it'll get monotonous doable. 

I provided clear compelling anecdotal evidence even today covid world go buy affordable healthy non processed food. Thats really takes disprove claim ""unhealthy food ALWAYS cheaper"" argument. Age kali yuga. doses ready go march, ramp there, maybe may means full capacity. Okay, so, say, wife. 31F, serious car accident young, major reconstruction bones metal plates. risk factor Covid? Maybe, places would say so, no. 40-50 group school age children own? spouses teachers? son's teacher's husband die then? 

Great! Teachers grandparents vaccinated. That's 1/2 exposure group best. city live 400k/900k county. city get 50-70 cases per dad, suburban county gets 500-1000 per day(both numbers last 10 days). difference school open suburbs never opened city. restrictions same. Yet open schools created 10x scale problem Canadian I'm pissed, issues feds vaccine companies. Things ramping though need look percentage, ~17% population 65+.

Plus, first link shows hospitalization death 65+ far higher 65. agree. Probably term used industry. Except 10th sequencing attempt. Maybe actually stomach flu. think likely vaccine cause side effects week later. Sick leave 
Universal Medicare think would fair US tell citizens they're going export vaccine supply neighboring industrialized nation caseload US much higher. essentially telling citizens prioritizing lives foreigners people. Vaccine going slow, variants. It‚Äôs gonna years certain population getting vaccine masks COVID 1. Ouch. cuts deep. take vague sure. doctor, especially official capacity, never tell something he's 100% sure about. Further, coming mouth, official statement government large scale decisions made based says. Using words like ""semblance"" allows room interpretation. think better approach Fauci would give percentages -- like ""there 85% chance able sit unmasked movie theater by..."" said, need scientists like Dr. Jha help us interpret data. don‚Äôt want another parents hysteria ruin another school year child regarding masking. Kids need normal lives back. Schools need reopen, full time, activities, everything, period. Kids suffered education social lives flushed toilet long enough.

If still going requiring masks schools activities completely back open. believe Pfizer said probably. Age factor, younger people pronounced responses, clinical trial data Relevant believe Operation Warp Speed, $10B+ funding, benefit vaccine development production, hopefully would put perspective question sharing. Even given guys slow rollout. Trudeau dropped ball badly rollout efforts grandkids paying interest spent last year. Nobodies paying anything back. Avoiding variants never going happen. article says despite vaccinations, variants herd immunity achieved. reality much risk willing tolerate manage healthcare system. since start pandemic. 

Vaccines administered need protection most, move on. Everyone wants vaccine get one due time, regardless. limited amount vaccine available anyway. ‚ÄúPeriodic closures‚Äù ? That‚Äôs anything close normal BREAKING: Epidemiologists conclude late 2025 US could steadily approaching degree semblance something bears subtle similarity something that, squint right, looks little bit like ""normality"". compared european countries? read article? bad math? stupid? say ‚ÄúI guess anything possible, extremely unlikely anything 2022 like see right now‚Äù aware competition. thought world wide pandemic calls world wide efforts stop spread. Sounds like something someone Canada would say! variants unforeseen issue could throw us curveball can't make promises.

Lol what? completely altering life 18+ months getting people vaccinated, think going able say ""oh NVM can't open back return normal variants."" crazy? supposed do, live like ever? 0 chance happens Sounds like government mishandled travel bans airplanes secure oxygen mask first helping others, kind need vaccine well given flaming pile doodoo moment. nephew going remote end year.

There 40 students 4 classrooms/teachers 7th grade.

In class two students attend 5 days week, effectively eliminating potential benefit hybrid. Essentially school saying classroom safe 7 students, 10.

Kindergarten 6th grade going attending full time starting middle March. 7th 8th grade stay hybrid ""because enough room social distance.""

What cafeteria gone unused past 6 months? 400+ seat auditorium? Honestly, since I'm pretty much tail end vaccine line, longer wearing masks anywhere I'm fully vaccinated. mask mandates still place, I'll keep one pocket avoid denied service somewhere. Alternatively, avoid businesses continue enforce mask mandates point, I'll spend money elsewhere welcoming environment. possible, that's incredibly irresponsible statement make imo. could least models tells us reducing total viral mass a% introducing selection pressure b gives us equivalent chances mutation compared nothing.

We could simulate based said model say, far know, spreading first dose expected saved/destroy lives whether better.

I surprised model already exist, fact would surprised doesn't. Even doesn't, seems like good place put research dollars into. GitHub repo archiving since mid-late December depending state updates every day CDC Even flu vaccine, 188 children died flu. 140 died COVID year. cases fall due vaccines mark. Well course down. significantly USA parts world barely anyone vaccinated. see correlates transmission. Unless test everyone virus they've fully inoculated. get source that?

Not saying lying, want something read/ wanting something show people saying purely Trudeau's fault worry people first. Sucks Canada isn‚Äôt well, American politicians obviously prioritize Americans. still long way go US it‚Äôs like sitting ton useless vaccines. mention Canada isn‚Äôt going covid mutation hotspot US funds healthcare technology medical advances the.my Nation also providing defense giving foreign aid country Glad better! know people get virus little symptoms others get full blown. cannot imagine symptoms week plus respiratory issues. grandpa died covid weeks back. One lungs collapsed filled blood. nothing could do. couldn‚Äôt imagine pain experienced. insulting incorrect suggest haven‚Äôt trying. You‚Äôre missing point. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt understand people getting worked something going happen. People already wearing masks less less, won‚Äôt wear 2022. 1: first second doses identical? difference makeup quantity makes 1st vs 2nd significant?

2: curiosity, actual amount ""product"" injected? size syringe, I'm guessing less 0.5cc -- anyone know sure??

Many thanks! Healthcare provincial thing. federal government assisting acquisition, provinces dole vaccines out. 

Also don‚Äôt forget conservatives gutted medical research vaccine manufacturing. 

Remember prepurchased vaccines anyone, vaccine companies don‚Äôt deliver Feds. job buying stock. Whataboutism isn‚Äôt helpful. America didn‚Äôt help there, either. Besides, aren‚Äôt even really arguing point. agree, war caused genocide per se, even said that. point largely ignored genocide got dragged war kicking screaming. administration isn‚Äôt following science. It‚Äôs following science. guess improvement flat earth morons Trump admin still deceitful. fall problem, studies already showed mrna vaccines protect enough variants? thoughts exactly last man dying. worry people break early someone die jumping gun. definitely place illegal alien.  seems like reasonable interpretation data. absolutely sure effective vaccines every variant emerge.

The signs good vaccines likely provide immunity protection mortality, square one regardless. I‚Äôm getting second dose Friday!! I‚Äôm exited ""too lazy get work home job"" think laziness, many people would've loved stay-at-home job, able to. Ok, Moderna first anyways Pfizer sue regardless. stupid? pretty obvious vaccinated, people rarely transmit virus. Isreal proving right now.

I literally said would wear mask whenever mandated know problem I'm wearing otherwise. absolutely attending anti mask protests ever becomes thing. Good God, fuck that. need suspend normal civilized existence 98 year olds squeeze couple extra months nursing home lives. $20 $10 per vaccine dose Pfizer Moderna. something poor nations can't afford. storage logistics problems poorer countries have, mention rich countries close relations pharmaceutical companies since they're based there. two sets relatives (in laws aunt/uncle) 70 unable get vaccinated due supply (these two separate states, it‚Äôs one locale). 

I unsure relatives technical literacy, would suggest someone helping them. know several people 70 saying, well doctor call time and, well called pharamcy call back. get vaccinated, going require bit effort track slot. chance get anti-fog glasses 2019. regret getting now.  Wait second. MSNBC saying vaccinated people hang Yes would seen cases people fully shielding getting something like food deliveries etc. 

There's literally millions millions cases virus, surface/food transmission major avenue would become obvious.

I'm saying possible clearly major driver infections measures focused Yeah, I'm done Fauci. sad think he's getting point dangerously obsessed restrictions. Restrictions harmful. End statement. virus harmful too, becoming much less big deal vaccine gets there, lot people would argue we're already point restrictions bigger problem virus. 1918 pandemic followed roaring 20's. Hopefully follow dirty 30's world war. Didn‚Äôt know people live like  Hello üòé Older people nursing homes actually like 100x likely die covid 30 year old. NY Fd early.

With said, point every state mass spread point. states time 20% positive rates Sure, small gap might wait. months difference, I‚Äôll take whatever get.

Besides, eventually supply scale probably get better vaccine. TIL Canada rich country  try practice proper safety hygiene least. *Mildly* successful? Capitalism gifted us fucking miracle pharmaceutical companies producing vaccines way are. wonder Trump administration limited public appearances. said would? We're Easter mindblowing. Canada vaccinating 20x slower US per capita! essentially finishing getting first batch vaccines December, honestly completed new year. situation volatile changing daily, maybe make predictions months flop next day. Man, feels refreshing Fauci drop news dumps virus almost daily basis Biden charge now. Whether it‚Äôs uplifting somber, it‚Äôs nice Fauci front this. Trump literally Babe Ruth bench vast majority virus president we're smart it, we'll keep mind going forward biomedical manufacturing capacity national security issue, we'll *whatever* takes keep primed present inside territorial borders. Say want policies/morals objectively Netanyahu idiot. He‚Äôs Mensa level genius (idr he‚Äôs officially Mensa member qualifies). there's tyrant looming pressuring him?

The rest career(30+ years) he's one significant public servants. made mistakes immense pressure source he'd never prepared for, he's allowed breathe, simply reporting science job again. think there's breach contracts. Although I'd imagine we'd pursue it. didn‚Äôt say eliminating smallest risk. say makes someone high risk feel safer, go it. Fomite transmission covid rare, agree you, it‚Äôs illnesses. people don‚Äôt never clean fruits veggies covid I‚Äôm gonna judge people either. That's predicted year ago, proper steps taken, 500,000 million deaths US. 

Trump denied people died.

It could half many. I'm saying remember family sat around laughing at. percentile 12 known genomes sort something like 8 genomes.

The US able spend $1.95 billion garuntee **FIRST** 100 million vaccines produced Pfizer states. summer unknown new fancy mRNA vaccine would even work.

That's spending $1.95 billion potential gamble. vaccine might effective. something else could've delayed it.

Not many countries money throw around like that. industries support it. think anybody saying group people vaccinated need wear masks. Unless I've missed something 

What they're saying person vaxxed, person B isn't, wear mask. personally think might unnecessary, especially face mounting evidence vaccinated curbs transmission.

I expect policy change data comes out, probably next weeks. I'd say ""there insufficient studies showing people transmit virus vaccination"". think issue 100% pharmaceutical companies Canada's market size. Trump passed opportunities buy vaccines Canada ordering require. think there's much gov. could done differently would resulted us getting vaccines delivered. Bottom line, we're fraction US EU markets allows bully positions simply have. 

It's fair. probably anything it. good news US demand drops could get enough vaccines Canadians day two's time. either economic social issues

I wish case, seem true decades.  Since turn century seen economic stances except selective trade protectionism aggressive bottomless deficit spending otherwise good economic times.  

In last 4 years also seems taken particular stance democracy never would imagined years past.  I'm sitting, term working banner literally relationship whatsoever 20th century use it. Almost contrary, really.

You might better trying describe policy interested defending rather using umbrella essentially meaningless.  speech seen right wing view

Interesting... Colin Kaepernick would find statement opportunistic fundamentally incorrect, imagine. running studies this. critical thing need know. Mulroney sold domestic vaccine production capabilities, moron. covid enthusiasts keep going long whatever excuse. Covid given lives meaning, many cases, wealth. forget guys supplied Europe rather US cause threatened make use Defense Production Act. brothers alright. people said Doctors prescribing prescription drugs Willy nilly abruptly taking patients opinion long elderly compromised individuals receive Pfizer vaccine enough. would prefer Pfizer, get J&amp;J even AZ, I'll least feel better fate, well bringing R value. one United States cares honestly people croaking didn‚Äôt care health first place. going awesome summer here.  right. year sustained lost wages, we've got maybe 1800 show it?

and PEUC PUA, lucky enough get get access.

edit: yes hyperbolic, spent 8.5 months unemployed volunteering help people navigate US Unemployment Insurance system, confidently say get nearly anything able make impact.

You saw fucking greedy government got picked arbitrary number like 600/wk realized gave majority nation chance living wage first time like 20 years. I'm least going wear masks I'm sick something like cold flu future need go out. hindsight seems selfish didn't. masks excuse. wearing masks 2022. 15 minutes close up, think people listening then. US dynamics 

Pick ""7 day average"", uncheck ""per 100 people"" remove ""World"". 1st February steady growth dailies started falter that. looks like peaked 1.5M per day. 

At rate take us lot 100 days vaccinate target. would interesting see study general tone stories comments reddit shifts relative whichever political party holds presidency given time. feel like anti american stuff become lot less popular since Biden took office maybe that's impression. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nah people still blame conservatives Canada lol. Yeah wasn‚Äôt proof first couple months. It‚Äôs year bud. vaccines produced, like physically? know place I'm certain host nation leverage advantage vs. exported shipments vaccines abroad. U.S.? vaccine production/distribution facilities? Lol nah I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôll wear feel sick need leave apartment otherwise absolutely Everybody know stopped hugging extended family members household. I‚Äôm sorry hear that. sucks. right now? Thanks conservative ideology, Canada privatized previously publicly funded vaccine production 1970's. companies closed shop moved production cheaper countries, forty years ago. 
You can't rebuild production capability overnight, dolt. Yea, well it? Gagillion times everything? Covid rate still dropping. Canada 571 COVID deaths per million. South Korea 30 deaths per million. American citizen living South Korea, I'm hoping Moderna, J&amp;J, Novavax prioritize supplying Canada (and Mexico) ASAP get massive COVID problem control, saying American companies bypass Canada supply Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, etc. ahead Canada since Canadians spread COVID drastically higher rate East Asia Oceania? yeah God want, care can't. can't pray God get infected, work. know what's working? man made vaccine. Canada gets Pfizer vaccine Europe. sure, I'm sure going this, said I'm *not* asking it.

and agree many points, historically commercial contributing nations capitalist regime, US certainly thinks deserves firsts. way treat ourselves, way we're portrayed. Many idiots campaigned ""America First"" mentality. nation stresses 'me' 'we' time time again.

you, however, moving conversation farther farther away nexus claiming statement ""hurting more"" call sympathy. know countries' governments run stone cold apathy, ethical/moral standpoint. history teaches us. especially pandemic. especially recession. numbers.

I'm saying I'm looking favorable outcome comparatively. point fact US arguably worse Canada handling pandemic. one would argue otherwise. conflating I've said, think.

We deserve fucking shade, man. country founded system severe inequality. highlighted pandemic. way nation watch infrastructure shatter around us baffling.

I digress, none shit patented commercialized, that's world live in. cold hard facts make distribute vaccines, gonna country first. cuz realistically economic powerhouse without returning shitty shitty equilibrium first.

we shit US til cows come home, I'll happy contribute. say finger pointed 3 coming straight back you. Yes, would coordinate share doses everyone 75+, then, 70+, 65+ reasonable opportunity get vaccine. That‚Äôs allies do. 22% South African variant. Sounds like somebody blind spots. Daily Mail causes cancer Obvious news! else new

Canada rely countries vaccine source % vaccinated US age group? make vaccines  Yeah, probably. I'm science. I'm also realistic outcomes. ""science"" tells us viral loads reduced nearly 90% lab, great news. still mean vaccinated people drop mask hug non vaccinated people. Social distancing probably fine, close breathing directly someone, still risk everyone vaccinated.

We're anxious get back less normal lives. I'd also hate see lives lost people read preliminary lab results another country different culture different government interventions read gospel. Honestly can‚Äôt blame US. They‚Äôre hardest hit country many metrics, need ensure house order helping people. Well, EU failed miserably aspects. Despite lockdowns quite high adherence containment measures , death rate / million remain similar US (and higher cases) (we told) government response population adherence disastrous. 

And comes vaccination campaign, told way out, fail again. Well, expert admitted issuing misleading claims manipulate people skepticism warranted. get vaccine that's going end year current rate. Please keep mind building manufacturing facilities can't done night. something takes years.

Canada used domestic vaccine manufacturing, since immediately profitable, privatized removed series governments long ago include attitudes part basic ideology. think understand effects selective pressure mutations. time start vaccinating fully vaccinated dangerous types mutations likely pass plan ignore vaccines came mean, outside ones living me, hugged family close year. They're elderly cautious good health, partner essential worker, reasonably high risk transmitting virus them. mostly keep contact virtually, met summer, socially distanced kept elbow bumps.

My family supposed get second shot today partner's parents next month, personally that's enough feel comfortable hug; hope agree see next. possible people testing way less vaccines around corner ? comment linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks sharing. idea things behind. certainly eye opening maddening. Thank work do. worry covid everyone's vaccinated who's danger. restrictions, would totally ridiculous still November swear I'll go insane are. initial study showed lower efficacy, recent studies shown better results: Would good see constructive criticism feedback government doing. Perhaps something governments doing. seems like country enough political economic clout US EU ask prioritization.

This goes back whole free market, ""let countries good at"" trade other. Though may good rule thumb normal times, clearly failed Canada. Perhaps way avoid future subsidize vaccine production heavily caught unprepared like future. someone elderly parents Ecuador, I'm terrified. I'm considering flying US categories fully open course risks.

I know Ecuador fucked bad, lots countries rich gotten several times vaccines per capita.  Seasonal surges, sorta like flu. explains story ‚Äî tbf, headline kinda shitshow. getting case, help us need governmental restrictions lifted order regain livings. Go stick dildo ass. contradicting remarks last month, Fauci defended vice president also knocked Trump administration's vaccine rollout asked comments Tuesday. think vice president referring is, actual plan getting vaccine doses people's arms really rather vague. mean, well-coordinated plan."" Fauci told CNN. wild difference posts daily thread. There's current conversation ""mental illness pandemic"" people still wipe groceries despite covid transmissible food. Food groceries. i'm also hyperaware people touch gets touched who. said daily thread i'd get baker acted. paid dosis bought stock piles.

The infrastructure countries... limited amount dosis. US hording dosis pressure higher spending instead acting solidarity. marketing strategy. Look early days, Fauci saying masks work surgeon general openly mocking use. communications team could worked understand position craft competent message. Neither Fauci surgeon general knew masks could help time, marketing person could sniffed told. wait studies better data. 

When people started defining political tribes via pandemic severity I'd worked sociologists, psychologists social media companies combat misinformation. Countries competent unified message much better didn't. That‚Äôs hoping picked November latest could go without fianc√© losing insurance. Gotta love America. Obviously get married courthouse neither us wanted that. Yes numbers can't possibly correct think reason skewed unhealthy people primarily ones dying study considering healthy long remaining lifespans. is, healthy 80 year old statistically live age 90, unhealthy 80 year old 3 serious health conditions common Covid death statistically live long.

40% fatalities occur nursing homes, average period time admitted nursing home dying 5 13 months depending source calculate (i.e. mean vs. median). average years life lost fatalities probably less 1.

If average ""YLL"" victim 16 years study suggests, would mean 60% victims would lose 26 years life, would suggest 60's case. average age covid fatality around 78 82 different parts country.

These numbers make sense. I've seen articles make point every time published numbers get higher. think reaching headline. Thank help. Vaxxed Illinois. provided insurance card optional. proof started different country UK. UK saw first country huge spike cases due variant , european countries see spikes variant much later UK. So, please, spread unproven information. Half million deaths. Far deaths country world. Heartbreaking. present echo chamber facts! could counter link links, around around we'd go. 

The way see right now, even experts fully understand new virus.  
And good, common sense hygiene least invasive thing help protect other, case. not. Hijacking top comment remind everyone washing fruits vegetables still good health practice regardless Coronavirus. Absolutely.  Rich got richer last year

Fauci ended highest paid federal employee 

Amazon Walmarts made like bandits


Just saying... Every adult wants vaccinated September (at latest). Obviously lot experience them, seems like mRNA vaccines might less prone this, right? glasses wearers likely bald? 

Never heard  don‚Äôt undertow works. SMH Right I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs difference *actual* doomsdaying realistic projections. 

Fauci said [at kind projections unrealistic, almost certainly hyperbolic. 

Kind side bar, looking back article, makes annoyed articles bad-faith commentators pull single quote fauci pretend said something didn‚Äôt. opinions almost always nuanced thoughtful, rash prognostications: Jake Tapper asked Fauci many COVID-19 cases United States expect see. ""To honest you, really firm idea,"" Fauci said. ""There things called models. someone creates model, put various assumptions. model good accurate assumptions. whenever modelers come in, give worst-case scenario best-case scenario. Generally, reality somewhere middle. never seen model diseases dealt [with] worst-case scenario actually came out. always overshoot. use numbers like million, million-and-a-half, 2 million [deaths], almost certainly chart. Now, impossible, very, unlikely."" I‚Äôm support Trump‚Äôs decisions, one made avoid discouraging pharmaceutical corporations vaccine development showing excessive interest one competitors. Sure, best decision *in hindsight*, least reason makes modicum sense. They‚Äôre never giving room make plan execute it. 

What supposed do? Blatantly disregard rules stomp feet I‚Äôm still roof? mean, good USA (specifically considering poorly COVID handled 2020), can't help think headline misleading also consider national populations... vaccination rate population density? retaliation. Fuck China everyone simps China they're addicted mass-produced cheap plastic nonsense Large part manufacturing advantage fact nobody bombing factories Look. Every freaking time could done job kept six feet apart. think 2 staffers chit chatting needing aisle I‚Äôm one else around? room walk around keeping distant don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre busy situation. shop downtimes store isn‚Äôt crowded debunks theory. fucking get clue keep distant. advocating time. Please read statements care. part taking 1/9 population per capita ensuring don‚Äôt fall absolute number fallacy. Saying infection rate 33 times Canada doesn‚Äôt capture whole picture. get 1c group infection death rate significantly less current. fact, look infection curves numbers coming rapidly. *At point*, consider diverting vaccine supply Canada.  Also remember Canada 3rd largest trading partner, want economy recover quickly pandemic also want help Canada. askinging Japan lol think people always something complain about, instance since supply delayed, turns ""why manufacturing capability first place"". required show proof vaccination anything like measles, now. 

Why COVID different? hate DJT planto ramp worked. reaaaally hate him. rehink that. want pandemic survivors learned something from. agree. public health messaging overly cautious point borderline detrimental vaccine effort. right now, since demand far outstripping supply. future supply demand balanced, may hard dig hole media public health created. 

It‚Äôs late start switching narrative public get vaccine go enjoy life. people Israel getting vaccinated bars. get ‚Äúgreen pass‚Äù go enjoy life again. That‚Äôs direction need start heading in. vaccine effort seems much exciting ours.  Trump.

* republican leaders
* Cuomo
* Newsome
* Pelosi
* Anti maskers
* Prevalence obesity
* People fearing poverty virus
* Conspiracy nuts
* etc... Yes, things going get better around September, maybe...which 5 months away, that's eternity days. Yeah, great hear medical professionals that. U.S. UK also unique advantages, disqualifying neither Israel‚Äôs. can‚Äôt build facilities? lol we‚Äôre 1 million day Trump Well yeah it‚Äôs way bullshit college students. meant they‚Äôre alone vaccines essentially eradicate death. People get sick still course amount deaths reduce minuscule amount makes sense keep locked May June every adult US opportunity get vaccine.

Nobody going stay masked summer vaccine. make sense to. US gave ton money get vaccines market fast possible make sure money wasn‚Äôt issue.

uhm, I'll leave here:

[Germany funded development Pfizer‚Äôs COVID vaccine‚Äînot U.S.‚Äôs Operation Warp see say FDA rejects AZ. one complaining aren‚Äôt getting American assistance. reasoning make much sense. couple reasons why.

There much fewer flu cases usual past year.

It surprising increase covid cases around time usually increase flu cases. respiratory viruses follow similar seasonal pattern, reasons completely understood. might people's immune systems weaker winter, viruses spreading better cold air, and/or people meeting inside, rather outside, winter. decisions Chrump make? decision last Summer pre-purchase extra vaccines? Great new report shows government failed act securing additional doses Pfizer BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine Monday, New York Times reported Trump administration passed opportunity acquire additional doses COVID-19 vaccine frontrunner beyond 100 million doses government purchased July's $1.95 billion deal. Given Pfizer BioNTech vaccine two-dose treatment, means 50 million Americans initially receive vaccine. Well, could always use military seal borders wait countries invent vaccine you. Obviously work US *are* 'other country' inventing vaccines half country thinks closing borders racist whatnot different? difference laws public hold public scrutiny try keep contracts secret. isn‚Äôt like open new company production site quickly export anyway.

Next time say ‚Äúthey made sure supply UK only‚Äù accurate truth one UK knows cares rather downvote talking EU blocking exports ones actually sharing limited supply New Zealand, Australia Canada commonwealth nations. queen head state make sure prioritise blame EU. Fauci enjoys spotlight bit much. Heres hoping US excess hand red leafed hat. Looking numbers kind sad. knew would process man seems like going slower expected. Especially well country like Canada. lockdowns actually politicians gain control? declarations emergency etc. gives power otherwise would on. do, gel sanitizer hands spray sanitizer objects. Better nothing, effective soap water. Fortunately I'm able stay home time. go well. Denying access places based inability get vaccine. Tbf probably happens America time don‚Äôt realize pride anti xenophobe, right? talking Canada. Bad wording part average age patient died COVID 84 years Germany, highly doubt that. Requiring students pay full tuition goods services receive

You don‚Äôt pay things never got Yes baldness thing ooh mine says 240 variants guess we‚Äôll see happens Canada vaccinates it‚Äôs senior citizens healthcare workers. cede vaccine supply countries less, go ahead start vaccinating younger healthier people? Every provincial vaccination plan I‚Äôve seen implies plan latter, course could change. Can‚Äôt imagine would go well politically, would moral thing do. Well part lgbt community already knew guy set back gay rights 20 years, suggesting evidence HIV airborne promoting permanent imprisonment positive cases.  definitive data, reinfection seems rare. One study Qatar suggests may low 1%. Regardless exact number, probably safe assume general, people already exposed COVID make poor future disease vectors. guess get reinfected make statistical difference comes future viral spread. However, assumption take variants mind. Link Qatar study Look graph. already wrong danger - it‚Äôs there. 

Only question avoid variant spike like happened UK. That‚Äôs race virus vaccine non-pharmaceutical interventions. 

It hard visualize exponential growth, basically need intervene looks like there‚Äôs problem otherwise quickly becomes late change anything. Masks make snotty Bad comparison.

This like sinking ship scenario. Weaker people children saved first. Yup! Semi-professional touring musician/singer-songwriter here, seriously considering change career going nursing school... seen many us patting back. I'm humbly grateful scientists developed vaccine give credit. I'm patting back.

As rub nose death grandmother New York, consolation, Canadians vaccinated since I'm resident South Korea. I'm bitter all. USA's COVID numbers worse Canada's Korea's, I'm glad people getting vaccinated first. Canada's numbers worse South Korea's, I'm glad vaccinated will. think missed said completely agree rest comment back mind type thought.

Which thought made clear. yeah wearing one next year No, not. know heard. gut feeling says politicians families got vaccines. Outside ER's, know anyone who's gotten one. Dr. Fauci said it‚Äôs possible may wearing masks 2022. I‚Äôm sure means wearing levels wear certain situations like large gatherings you‚Äôre fully vaccinated even large gathering okay Workers company eligible vaccine meeting swear heard 1/3rd employees declining. Idiots. U.S. least, pace vaccinations continues grow expected tracks new supply dumps we're getting Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J shots materializing June, months away moot point.

I'm lowest-risk, lowest priority group vaccination, I've fully immunized, virtually everyone vulnerable huge chunk population-at-large too. point, unless sight unseen reason mass vaccinations proving effective hospitalizations deaths, done mask-wearing, lingering mandates not. point won‚Äôt choice child fall. Surely vaccine better vaccine though? Please delete comment, least add trigger warning. I'm literally shaking rn  thought operation warp speed administration? notice passport valid six months. happens that? year isolation 4 months okay. I‚Äôm waiting vaccination (I‚Äôm immune compromised) go outside without panic attack day get it. I‚Äôm sorry hear Dad. 
Getting positive test doesn‚Äôt really anything though, already quarantine 2 weeks what‚Äôs point. Keeps going public well Asking sympathy asking favourable outcome. say one country hurting asking sympathy indirectly saying deserve front.

Canada deal vaccine rollout waiting, due manufacturing issues need to. However, US vaccinating higher rate capability produce vaccine, rest world thinks deserve go first. Yeah, kids‚Äô teachers last week. Despite superintendent informed parents district wouldn‚Äôt consider reopening late March, would heavy hybrid (few days per week, hours per day) best, even hybrid wasn‚Äôt assured. Meanwhile kids still formal informal daycare workers without vaccines. makes sense. Yes. Hawaii lower pretty much anywhere Canada entire pandemic. certainly exception. &lt;Insert Peter Griffin skin color chart meme cases dropping like flies, why?? thing countries holding lot vaccines others like Canada 3 weeks without shipment. Agreed. problem isn‚Äôt Fauci supposed predict future. problem Fauci great deal influence happens future, enormous public platform Biden calls ‚Äúchief medical adviser.‚Äù frustration Fauci comes insistence keep tougher masking distancing measures throughout 2021, even though vaccines widely available summer. advocates this, governors mayors listen him. 

And said above, think hurts effort convince vax-hesitant people Fauci emphasizes nothing change even vaccines get here. makes people think, ‚Äúwell, getting then?‚Äù whatever wants. soon get vaccinated, I'm done giving fucks. post? Anytime someone says ""Emergency powers"" lately, think two things: rise Hitler Germany, rise Emperor Palpatine Revenge Sith. ""I SENATE"". examples fiction non fiction, know ends. personal decision. don‚Äôt see illwill J&amp;J non-mRNA vaccines also lower efficacy.

That's 

A) started vaccinating people mass yet J&amp;J

B) concept mrna vaccines vs non mrna vaccines interpreted good vaccine vs inferior vaccine (for better worse) really hit public conscience yet enough places. AZ even approved US, first non-mrna vaccine expect hit J&amp;J, think people come March April either hold Pfizer Moderna, take J&amp;J attemp get mrna one later fall supply freed general public. post nationalism anyway ? Yup group teenagers did. many 4-5 teens party going. Someone ski resort went shut down. least turned music :) also 0.000001% chance something bad happening child care worker obviously refuses get shot. Americans understanding scientist commit absolute timelines...a combo like PB &amp;J Another reason getting sooner rather later eventually masks going go away/crowds back &amp; want get caught infected could've gotten vaccine end pandemic restrictions. Venues even held liable infections, let alone enough vaccine available. Social pressure vaccinate sooner &amp; stop wearing masks also likely going full force northern summer approaches. think Fauci et al may playing wrong angle now. ought encouraging people get vaccines available region/age group. honestly think Canada would sending US vaccines Canada's fucking embarrassment right now.  Yes, girlfriend (PSW nursing home) got second dose morning. supposed last week delayed week due shortage. seem getting back track, least getting people second dose. also working getting residents first dose next weeks. Things moving forward slowly surely That's get bureaucracy serve people, aan economy. that. feel way, comment really disheartening read Canadian. Glad know feel way.

We ‚Äúincredibly dismissive‚Äù state US last year, watched horror government botched response seriousness COVID let get hand. saw numbers climb genuinely hoped best neighbours, whole nightmare over. reason vaccine needed States due inability many trust experts bare minimum wearing mask. 

I thought relationship could get back trump office, know one comment.. ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù rhetoric wants continue hope Canadian government takes notes forms stronger bonds reliable allies. ? said 80% known Neanderthal genome represenative breakdown. mean 80% DNA it. known 100% Neanderthal genome. 80% known genetic data. 

God damn son. want teeth knocked too. Let know fly to. surprised shocked frankly immunology, biological, illnesses like COVID-19 general

I‚Äôm actual scientist (my PhD viral immunology). I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre one doesn‚Äôt understand immunology well. 

It‚Äôs unusual vaccine candidate prevent spread virus (especially read vaccine candidates early stages development- ones never make animal models). It‚Äôs naive assume brand-new-to-humans type vaccine brand-new-to-humans virus would prevent transmission. 

The reason immune response mucosal tissues largely separate systemic immune response (I.e. blood). vaccines given intramuscular injection, great job generating systematic response (which keep getting sick), piss poor job generating mucosal job immune response. easily situation virus replicates fine oral nasal mucosa (making contagious) without able make sick systemic immune response. Yep, vaccines get delivered ""on time"" dont domestic production (it's currently construction there's ever next time) 

People shit feds want, order X amount, X 3x population, even get morsel that, I'd hardly call LPCs fault Oh no! That‚Äôs Mom buy groceries Excellent statistical analyses, look like control groups condescension misplaced. love word smithing. quote could've come Dr. Fauci himself. Read article. addresses Yes. opened inside Thanks sharing I‚Äôm sorry hear still delays getting vaccines like need most. Hopefully colleagues able get latest shipment. Thanks work do! Though purely anecdotal, received AZ vaccine 3 months ago (unblinded trial participant) I've multiple direct exposures individuals covid since then. developed symptoms tested positive. Regardless poorly governments AZ reported data, vaccine works. delay getting vaccinated able vaccinated vaccine approved reputable medicine regulatory agency could difference life death. that‚Äôs East Asia

No don‚Äôt. Mask wearing cold one thing. That‚Äôs week year exactly Japan. don‚Äôt walk around masks prevent asymptomatic spread viruses.

I tell I‚Äôm *NOT* fine wearing mask public rest life - propose? force wear one? force not? get choice want wear mask not? that‚Äôs closed season. went skiing last week. easy keep distance lifts signs employees reminding people. I‚Äôd say covid safe activity. Candara need vaccine much U.S (As Canadians constantly reminded us last year).  Oh bro, one asking sympathy here. made mess. you. don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs correct this. 

He mostly agrees this, actually. 10-1. MSM wont tell ya this. Don‚Äôt doubt it, wonder Florida experiencing level herd immunity point. Good see numbers continuing go down! parents thought slipped family members over. dad uncle ICU grandmother probably next. cousin lied going out. family dies cousin absolutely responsible deaths. Statista 22.58 million people aged 75+, roughly 50% 1+ shot, roughly 17% shots.

That's actually less thought. already vaccinated nursing homes, frontline medical 75. death rates still much worse US due large numbers infected people. wait till death rates even out? really hope BioNTech celebrating, developed hell vaccine far surpassed expectation. active thread I'm elderly, designated frontline health essential worker, anything. regular middle age software industry guy worked home anyway years pandemic.

If could get two jabs AstraZeneca one like *right now* without wait months ones, I'd choose AZ one problem. Remember guys always talking shit much medicine costs US, one responses cost (outside broken insurance system) US sinks massive amount money R&amp;D? Canada cutting-edge vaccine research manufacturing capability, whining U.S. looking citizens first, vaccine. Something think high horse. feel sorry children You‚Äôre trolling good either. Disengagement students thing forever. pandemic merely revealing it. great that‚Äôs that

I stop reading. That's many thats one continues wear mask. Enjoy. Sure given choice getting Pfizer shot 3 months vs getting AZ/j&amp;j would prefer waiting 3 months especially considering number cases dropping sharply now.

Granted case everyone's situation different. socialize people getting shot available soonest make sense. Ok ‚Äúwe‚Äù it? Happy send care package facts don‚Äôt care feelings! Given relative geographic spread fact 20% people, really fair comparison? everyone blaming government? Clearly story indication US playing fair, otherwise would able receive we'd ordered time. 

If took one daily total doses entire country they're unwilling relax policy help us out, egregious Liberals' murky procurement. put 100% US. Testing part it. Prevalence post-Covid syndrome several months mass vaccination likely drive long-term public opinion masks. alarmist studies false, everyone dog developing brain fog incontinence, see masks gone good.

Few bother masks shelter tiny minority population require special protections; safety unfortunately burden. 7676 cases like nothing country size Germany. similar bout pearl clutching Idaho gym hosted event, typical redditors saying everyone gonna die, hysteric, etc. etc.

This whole pandemic really show people need stop trusting tv people blindly. people getting worked Fauci saying masks till 2022?

Because live area mandates stay long possible hate them. wing whackjobs, knows. I'll never understand Reddit. Covid reservations people careful that's them. guess easier downvote half brain reason full one. Well peak recording cases 3 days Canada total stat kinda useless. two countries vastly different populations Wait... thought sucked this? entire idea distance kids complete nonsense anyway. Hybrid reduces number contacts classroom day, increases total contacts forcing additional cohorts non-class days. makes sense think kids don‚Äôt exist classroom. It‚Äôs sad see theater continue 11 months. hygiene theater things, like ‚Äòdeep cleaning‚Äô aren‚Äôt actively harmful, hybrid school reduced class size ineffective schooling opposite makes sense limit spread Covid. Talk fellow countrymen delighted website us misfortune think shut facilities years ago /r/shitamericanssay Canaan, I'm happy US well vaccinations. guys deserve break last year. really importance one shot vaccines like Johnson Johnson really become important vaccination strategy. totally possible reactions valid. Check article, interview academics end pandemic long term future it. 

What happen COVID relegated course typical human disease. People really pay attention it, people get sick, we'll go lives 2019. 

In 10 years one going care COVID IMO save lab people making vaccines. article says nothing vaccines, proteins, formation memory B cells. one does, proves lot people US would expect much higher total numbers percentage population article says 12% vs almost 3%. Wow. we're one month post Trump. Good luck guys, know pull hope get vaccines sooner rather later. mean, that's arguing semantics. countries wanted hoard vaccine themselves, I'm sure could refused exports US did. Yeah us better job preparing local production. Sharing production happen eventually. first shot gives ~75-85% efficacy depending shot. that‚Äôs assuming first shot yeah. Lol imagine thinking unions better corporations Instant gratification reactive nature US is. Nothing US preventive, reactive, except military. bad considering storms throughout country fucked things Includes loved one I‚Äôm guessing?! Enjoy! careful calling things labeled misinformation scrubbed existence. Today‚Äôs misinformation could tomorrow‚Äôs facts. post article misconstrues (or least poorly represents) said? ""Normal maybe wear mask hospital"" good start framing. ""NOT well established""

Now spreading still alot know, cmon Boris Johnson literally cites U.K variant lockdown lived meteor storm, scientists telling us sit tight might over, saying ""nah ok I'm coming box"", fair, overreaction scientists part think people saw benefits wearing masks people **want** wear them, it‚Äôs choice. Don‚Äôt mandate it, don‚Äôt shame others wearing also. first guess likely correct. us combated vaccines. otherwise people back full normal, willing accept risks. hear man. definitely difficult wear mask warmer months. Personally, continue wear long goes on. pneumonia years back b*tch Canada domestic vaccine production facilities. they're owned GSK Sanofi, viable covid vaccine. GSK plant Quebec City produced vaccine doses H1N1 2009. terrible bot People absolutely ignore mandates hilarious post even hour old already reddit experts questioning *actual* infectious disease expert. wish guy middle finger big blow-up baby trump could immature express feelings instead [suppressing Alot humans neadrathal DNA.. alot 50%.

I've really good following restrictions. can't see vaccinated friends family small chance one us carrying covid, spreads someone else, become symptomatic, spread high risk person also becomes symptomatic...I know folks. everything going forever ever, what's point rushing vaccines? 

I wedding 2022, hope things close normal seeing articles difficult. Fear mongering. want everyone get vaccinated stay locked up...and yet even know percentage population disease? Let's real science - test entire population Covid19 antibodies, see REAL morbidity complication rates are, rather ones invented based projections miniscule (relatively speaking) number positive tests?

He also states depends much virus is. example said 20,000 cases per day time ago (I‚Äôm guessing summer). vaccines job number gets slashed. pull back masks. That‚Äôs important part here. isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúone case covid many‚Äù he‚Äôs saying get fall still tens thousands cases, much changed. 

Think it: people getting tested they‚Äôre sick encountered somebody got sick think they‚Äôre risk. add vaccinations you‚Äôre going get lot people tested people aren‚Äôt sick. vaccinated person isn‚Äôt running covid testing line because.  way disingenuous even conversation with... ifr teachers 0.6. likely much lower. 0.6 general population including retirees elderly.

We'll get large chunk vaccines Europe think Canada start becoming friendly Europe opposed States prepare next time President calls us national security threat. US burned lot goodwill last 4 years. Could step back right direction. He's scientist, people dont like lingo scientists use face questions dont concrete answers to. Words like *may*, *possible*, etc...

Truth is- things looking amazing right now, still need strong vaccine acceptance among general population including young adults drivers spread. hit high threshold vaccinations, we'll spared chance surge fall. vaccine acceptance wanes + natural immunity begins wane, *possible* we'll need mask fall deal flu season + COVID. 

Im optimistic, though, believe we're going curb stomp nasty little critter back strong sense normal summer time. Bingo. US 3-4 times cases per capita compared Canada. Also, percent positive rate indicates US missing lot positive cases it‚Äôs testing enough, Canada doesn‚Äôt seem be. 

Have stomp virus little first epicenter. frustrating aspect fact lab leak need know exactly type research Chinese labs doing. fact moratorium gain function research ended 2018. moratorium lifted prematurely? outright never conduct gain function research dangerous (ex. covid)? questions might never answers instead coming forward truth possibly preventing future pandemic, China decided cover tracks limit investigation.

Why there's nothing hide? Hitler liked dogs, what's fucking point? Covid never eliminated. like flu. get yearly booster, important elderly people immune issues. get run risk getting deathly ill. average&amp;median ages death covid america/europe around 80 2-3 pre existing conditions.

This must cut paste response yours. absolutely one thread refusing wear masks calling cold. someone tries blame Liberal government building back up:

Vaccinations might force variants evade vaccines thrive. Currently, might ""South African"" variant (or similar ""Japanese"" one). country UK variant went detected 10% cases 70% 6 weeks. can't see reason vaccine evading variants achieve result. hope really seems like realistic outcome me. i'd get vaccine 2030 part vaccine nationalism.

Hey remember Canada mocked U.S. citing defense concerns protect domestic steel manufacturing capacity? ""wE wOuLd NeVeR aTtAcK yOu"" - issue hand.

Israel population 9 million lol, vaccines US distributed amongst 50 states entire argument bananas- could built production facility designed produce vaccine didn‚Äôt yet exist. never said cause instead refuting guy saying reason correlate due older people likely bald certainly need provide proof vaccination attend public schools US.

Frankly believe right, baked Probably average, they're likely lot smarter people, actually know wear mask properly social distance properly.

Not religious, phrase ""the meek shall inherit earth"" probably means something here.

Don't insulted. Think it. internet trolls, Canadian co-workers English school Korea work. Whereas Korean, American, British co-workers compassionate death grandmother expressed condolences, Canadian colleagues gloated grandmother's death, scolded electing Trump (who vote for) healthcare system (one reason left US). sounds like prioritize older people vaccine instead healthcare workers essential workers genpop. great hear good sign we've founding ease forward healthcare workers starting relax 

I know feel like light brighter since got first dose working drug store made sure extras went right staff That‚Äôs great hear. deserve much efforts front line.

I'd argue little bit. sort like mindless military worshipping, really need stop.

The reality healthcare workers underperformed. example - data clear. Healthcare workers enjoyed extended holidays weekends pandemic peaked vaccines sat fridges. Rather getting shots arms, took time relax. almost certainly directly resulted thousands additional deaths. live area delivery option. curbside places offer that. Even do, don‚Äôt offer curbside everything store. test 500k/day false positive rate 0.8% false negative rate anything less 100%, 4k/day positives would absolutely mean zero infections. false negative rate irrelevant here.

COVID spreading person-to-person. long around someone infected maskless extended period time, chance getting low. articles resources discuss topic opening messenger RNA facility vaccine production timeline?

So far good. Astrazeneca recommends 12 week interval doses recent study last week showed Pfizer also effective still 12 week delay.

There controversy study backed UK's decision first went strategy recent studies proven UK's approach correct. thing Pfizer vaccine technology developed Germany manufactured US.

What's odd overlap flu season surge.

This armchair hypothesis here, but- actually kind wombo-combo influenza suggestion flu vaccine might decrease severity COVID-19 prompted researchers University Florida conduct retrospective study 2,500 patients tested positive COVID-19. examined comorbidities influenza vaccination status order determine severity disease based hospitalization ICU admission. determined COVID-19 patients receive flu vaccine within previous 12 months 2.44 greater odds hospitalization 3.29 greater odds ICU admission compared COVID-19 patients received flu vaccine.

Some kind symbiosis makes sense there. numbers much lower outside flu season. could see scenario either cough induced influenza leads greater spread comorbid COVID, perhaps getting whacked much dangerous detecting comorbid influenza.

Yes, harmful. face breaking nearly year due dirty ass mask he's never washed. ""Everybody hates America, nobody turns greencard üòâ."" Quote immigrant dad. refit company already specializes technology intellectual capital already.  misunderstood saying, it‚Äôs clear though been. 

It also clear vaccines slow transmission, protection even asymptomatic infection. unknown reliable protection is. individual knows protected time, especially since depends factors like much virus nose. wear masks vaccines can‚Äôt rely virus there. everyone knew would cause slowdown cases.  vaccinated people 'carriers', that, question 'can vaccinated person spread?'

We know spread vaccinated groups unvaccinated groups (or least, ruled out) . need know is, 

do people spread vaccinated, people vaccinated spread lot,?

or

do vaccinated people spread little bit?

It appears, based studies conducted, that, vaccinated, people spread all, still spread. probably mean different masking strategy. Since know big spreaders without LOT testing, mask policy based potential highest shedding vaccinated people, safe side. Everyone deals differently. 

Elderly people focus virus relief effort likely die.

Young people prime years life stripped away them, needs sidelined. Nobody really cares Interesting, even weeks ago also saying UK variant going cause another wave. 

I think he‚Äôs right though, vaccinations fact many people already infected, won‚Äôt opportunity cause huge wave. Yes exactly happens vaccines. flu vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission. Side effects vaccine may include FREEDOM! Username checks out. human cost death. Mental health, domestic violence, unemployment, loss jobs, loss opportunities, loss education attainment (especially children), etc. 

Not saying it'll equal deaths, let's paint rosy picture comes Canada. 22,000 deaths would 220,000 per capita basis compared US. Better, still awful. Businesses hit hard going deny customers they're trying recover. vaccine available everyone masks done. Check biodynamic farming, rather big France along history crazy people.

Sounds great upfront, organic, combined mixed live stock find stuff like buried goat skulls harvesting naked old you? think 20 year old college student ass going get anywhere asking get vaccinated California üòî Know plenty, agree has. HS teacher years ago still work lots young folks. hit everybody hard. think 90 year old granny cartwheels barely seen children grandkids year? even (or understand) internet. zoom, FB. Terrified she'll die alone one night hiding fucking virus.

So like said, what's baseline? First make sure every American gets vaccinated. Still millions people risk. Healthcare workers risking lives months vaccines came out, saved millions lives, do? Ironically policy offering ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù type advice vaccine receivers punishing people state governments/Heath departments listen CDC/fauci‚Äôs every word. Others lift restrictions sooner that. people/states sacrificed punished most. 

It‚Äôs also making people reject advice portion asinine ignore rest. 

If want shoot foot, whatever. Yep. Nice see America kicking ass sure hope so. seem like anyone actually this. main problem people like ""I'm gonna go right back normal getting vaccine"" dipshits lie vaccinated try get wearing masks public. People hardly fucked wear properly is. people actually vaccinated, understandable want wear masks decent amount people immunity small fraction people vaccinated irresponsible.
